Married just shy of 5 years and together with my STBXW for 10 years. I am 37 and she is 34. This all came on so sudden. Long story short, she lost a lot of weight quickly on Zepbound and many red flag comments ensued. “A guy bought me coffee at Starbucks and called me beautiful, I have a fantasy of you watching me have sex with another man, my male co-worker says he masturbates to the thought of me, you deserve a “hall pass” to have sex with women as you please”. This all came on within the span of about 2 months as her weight shed rapidly. I went on a vacation and she left the house late and came home late and deleted the footage. Called her out on it and she filed for divorce in early June



Been a rough road since, co-living in my home as she dresses up almost every night, posted a “post glow up” Instagram post that my neighbors alerted me about. We decided not to have children (thankfully) years ago. She told me “with the right man I would have children”. “Marriage is just a piece of paper”. Really cruel stuff.



I pet my dogs for the last time tomorrow. I am in the military so as a soon to be single man I can't properly care for them alone. She packed all her stuff up and is leaving this weekend. Court is next week.



The feeling of betrayal, most likely infidelity, lack of communication from her up to this point has been emotionally draining for me. Worst I have ever felt. I feel like I wasn't given a proper chance to fix things. My faults: I let the marriage get stale this past year I'd say.... fell into routine.



I just feel her rapid weight loss led to “grass is greener” effect and she straight up discarded me. I feel I wasn't good enough for her new image. With that rapid weight loss however, she became CRUEL! Pain.",1,1752800394.0,Divorce,0,1.0,False

I always used the default profile P1 and then the manual power settings on my 2000AB but didn’t really grasp why I lowered the power after FC other than trying to stretch the roast. That changed last night when I came across a YT video from a year ago with Andrew Coe, the US roasting champion who used a Behmor to win. 

I took notes on his views on roasting light and medium on a Behmor. What he said made a lot of sense, so today I tried it. I had also bought a coffee bean cooler, as I knew the Behmor cooling cycle was causing my roasts to “coast” to darker than I intended. I bought a Dyvee bean cooler off Amazon. It wasn’t cheap but seems to be very well made.  I did my first light(er) roast. As Coe suggested, I started with 270 grams of Colombia Supremo coffee at full power for 7 minutes, then reduced the power to P4 up to the beginning of FC (14:35), cut the power to P3 for a minute, then P2 for a minute, then dumped the beans into the cooler. The beans weighed 230.9 grams so 14.5%. 

Time will tell how they ultimately taste (they are resting) but the beans are a light brown and uniform. Finally!",1,1752800274.0,roasting,0,1.0,False
1m2opex,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2opex,Just some things I noticed in Belly and Jeremiah’s rooms that I thought were cute and Jelly coded that I have not seen anyone mention yet.,"Picture 1: Belly’s room actually the first one when I took this I thought the contact lenses were Jeres but then I remembered that Belly wore them too. Is that a Polaroid camera behind the curtain? Also the blue container next to it is Jenni’s ice cream and Jelly must have been eating some. The flavor is Frose- it’s  sangria style frozen rose’ wine with pear, strawberry and watermelon in case any one wants to know. 

Picture 2: This is Jeremiah’s room and I noticed he has olly gummies to help him sleep. There is a picture of him and Belly

Picture 3: okay this is one of my favorite couplet photos. We see There are two coffee mugs one that says B for Belly and one that says J for Jeremiah! Next to Belly’s cup we see Jere’s contact lenses case and Belly’s nail polish and lip gloss. Also on the far right you can see what looks like a makeup bag with butterflies and a hairbrush for Belly. 

Picture 4: okay not in their rooms but I love she is wearing Jeres frat sweater. 

Picture 5: back to Jeres room he has a little espresso maker and another picture of him and Belly! 

Picture 6: okay I know it’s super blurry I did my best but we are in Belly’s room again and we see she has another picture of her and Jeremiah and it’s the same one that Jere has on his desk in the last photo! 

Picture 7: this is Jere’s necklace and I have been trying to figure out what it is. Does anyone know? 

Picture 8 and 9: not sure if this was mentioned but Belly has a blue daisy necklace on I don’t think I have seen her wear it before? Her earrings match well the color does anyways. ",1,1752800271.0,jellyshippers,0,1.0,False
1m2oor6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AO3/comments/1m2oor6/crazy_ending_to_this_fic_that_i_was_absolutely/,crazy ending to this fic that i was absolutely enjoying,"Before I get into this, Im not critiquing the author and how they chose to write their own story, nor am I trying to review/rate it, as a reader I was just like hold up what?? Hello?? Like Im just saying it ruined the entire fic for me and I was about to post about it in the fandom subreddit but I want to keep it 100% anonymous lest the author see. 

Okay so to start off the writing is insane, like top notch literature over here I was so enjoying the word structure and everything linguistic about it. And then the chemistry is off the charts, mind you this is an AU where the characters have slightly different backstories so their personalities are a little different but it was literally insane, like the tension was so thick and I was screaming into my pillow trying to get them to kiss. 

And then after 75k ish words (80k total), the author includes a random, super quick out of nowhere self defense killing scene that gets the main character jail time for FIFTEEN YEARS, then the chapter is like ""year three and he blah blah"" then he ends up getting out at year ten but thats honestly no better? It just came out of NOWHERE I was like WHAT??? HELLOO?? Its tagged incarceration, but the main character canonically went to juvie and has a record so I didnt think much of it...maybe thats my bad.. but like it was insane to me? TEN WHOLE YEARS? Like what was the point of the fic then? Like all the mundane coffee shop stuff and then you go to jail for ten years Im so confused what even brought this on. Like im devastated I was so ready for the couple to be cutesy happy ending, and they end up together.. but after ten years apart like hoe what?

Anyway, this is not something I would comment under the fic, or voice to the author in anyway, I was just so disappointed  and confused. Not to mean this maliciously,  but I didn't even bother bookmarking it because I was like it's ruined for me?? Im just complaining because I read this and the ending killed me and Im just in shock.",1,1752800216.0,AO3,1,0.6,False
1m2oo37,https://www.reddit.com/r/networking/comments/1m2oo37/private_vlan_sanity_check_pci_requirements/,Private VLAN Sanity Check PCI Requirements,"I'm looking for a sanity check, as my hands-on experience with Private VLANs is limited outside of prior CCNP studies.

We're currently operating a corporate office spanning 8 floors, supporting approximately 1,500 users. The network is built around a pair of Catalyst 9500s functioning as a collapsed core, with fiber uplinks to 9300 access-layer stacks on each floor.

The core layer manages building-wide VLANs (e.g., wireless, guest, transit) and also handles DHCP services. Similarly, the floor switches host DHCP for local workstation VLANs and a legacy voice VLAN. Management and wireless VLANs are trunked to all access stacks.

Our environment is fully cloud-based (SaaS), with no on-prem servers. All resources are accessed via ExpressRoute to Azure, integrated through our SD-WAN. (Also to look to possibly get rid of SD-WAN go internet only and just up our connection speed) We've also recently deployed Netskope, which uses NPA servers to provide secure access to cloud-hosted services.

We're exploring ways to simplify our wired infrastructure by transitioning to an internet-only access model. The security team has mandated strict client isolation to meet our PCI compliance requirements. They want to eliminate all east-west communication between clients, enforcing a strict north-south flow to the internet. Netskope will enforce firewall policies and user access controls beyond that.

For wireless, this is straightforward—Meraki can handle NAT and client isolation natively. However, on the wired side, Private VLANs appear to be the most viable option. My current understanding is that we would need to:

* Create an isolated VLAN per floor (or per access switch stack),
* Define a single community or promiscuous VLAN at the core,
* Trunk those isolated VLANs back to the core.

Essentially, we aim to replicate a ""coffee shop"" experience—users connect to wired or wireless and get routed directly to the internet, with no ability to communicate with each other.

We do have a NAC solution in place today, but it's not delivering meaningful security value and is a candidate for decommissioning as part of this redesign.

Does this approach make sense for our goals, or is there a better way to achieve this kind of wired client isolation at scale?

It took me 4 months to go from total beginner to this. This time period includes multiple breaks for (minor) injury and a couple repeated runs when I was getting back into things. 
  
My tips: 
  
* **Take breaks when you need to.** I took multiple breaks for minor pains that arose in the course of the program. I took an even longer break for a more serious foot strain that hit about half way through. Don’t push through pain, and don’t be afraid of losing progress. I did exactly zero cross training during a 2 month break, and after 6 weeks of PT and working on form, was back on W7 without much difficulty. 
* **It really is mental.** W5D3 is tough! Also, it was just as hard, if not harder, to take time off to rest as it was to run. Resting takes discipline too. 
* **Do dynamic warm ups and light strength training.** I like Run with Ash on YouTube for these. 
* **Practice habit stacking to help with consistency.** I would run in the morning after my coffee. Know the time that works best for you to build the habit then stick with it.
* **You don’t need fancy gadgets.** To each their own, but you don’t strictly need a smart watch or HR monitoring to be successful in this beginner program. It was just me and the Just Run app. I do recommend quality shoes though. I went to Fleet Feet for mine. 
* **Surround yourself with accountability buddies.** I told multiple friends when I started the program. I got to keep them updated on my journey and it really helped motivate me, especially chatting to my friends who are also runners!

What do I do?,"I work full-time in rostering for a disability support org in Australia (NSW). Yesterday, I was pulled into a surprise meeting with my boss and berated over shift multiple shift cancellations last week across the whole country (I just manage one state). For context, we have hundreds of shifts go ahead every week and we are only allowed to cancel once every staff member has said no, once without an incentive and again with an incentive, and if no shuffles can be made. When I tried to explain myself my boss said he doesn’t want to hear my excuses and that I should be coming in an hour early “so my days aren’t complete shit.”

For further context, they fired my coworker who I used to share my job with to save money, and we both worked full-time managing our state, and their only solution to her not being on anymore that I got was “yell out if you need a hand”. Even when I had their support I was insanely busy. This week they finally agreed to put someone back on, but only for 3 days a week to help me, but I’m still down someone 2 days a week, and I have an insane backlog of work to get through.

Later, they held a full team meeting with my manager and the CEO where they told us we’re not allowed to leave work until every vacant shift is covered — even if that means staying past 8pm (unpaid). They asked if everyone understood, and I said nothing but I also didn’t agree, so they singled me out and asked me if I understood — to which I said I couldn’t commit to that because if that’s the case, then I wouldn’t be leaving until 8pm - 10pm at night every day. My manager said he “didn’t want to hear it” and the CEO said “if I was doing my job properly, I wouldn’t have to stay back until 8pm at night”.

Again for context, this job is insanely busy, I don’t have time to talk to my coworkers, get a coffee, or even breathe. I sit at my desk grinding all day non-stop, and often do at least 2hrs of overtime or more every week anyways.

He said most of his patients find it more stressful than it’s worth and end up worse off. He said I should just put up with it until I find another job and can quit.

I feel so much anxiety about returning to work  because they said this would be an ongoing thing, that they wouldn’t allow me to leave until I cover every shift.

Formula None here. I’m a Psytrance producer with releases on Black Hole Recordings, Iono Music, and now releasing with Iboga Records. Over the last 5 years, I’ve made plenty of mistakes and learned a lot through trial and error. I wanted to share some key lessons I wish I had learned earlier. While these are based on my experience with Psytrance, they apply to most electronic music genres.

**1. Get your kick, bass, and drums right early**  
The low end is the foundation of your track. If your kick and bass groove is locked in, everything else becomes easier. It helps with arranging, mixing, mastering, automation, and even writing melodies.

**2. Start with a clear idea or concept**  
If you feel stuck or directionless, it's often because you don't have a strong theme. A simple melody, vocal, sample, or rhythmic idea can give your track the identity it needs and keep you focused. 

**3. Good songwriting will do wonders**  
A clean 16-bar loop doesn’t mean much if the full track doesn’t go anywhere. Your music needs to flow and maintain energy from start to finish. Don’t be afraid to finish rough drafts, even if they’re messy. You’ll learn way more by completing ideas than by obsessing over a loop. Over time, you’ll start to understand what those loops need to evolve into full tracks.

**4. Know your creative environment**  
Everyone works differently, but we all need focus. Some people need silence. Others thrive in a coffee shop. Figure out where you work best and create a routine that supports it. It makes a huge difference in your output.

**5. Surround yourself with other producers**  
Hanging out with other producers is one of the fastest ways to improve. You’ll learn new techniques, get honest feedback, and stay motivated. One of the most eye-opening things for me was realizing that even successful artists deal with the same challenges, creative blocks, self-doubt, and finishing tracks. You’re not alone.

That’s it for now. I might share more down the line. If you have your own lessons or insights, I’d love to hear them.

If anyone is interested in paid 1:1  lessons, feel free to reach out. I’ve worked with beginner to intermediate producers and really enjoy teaching. I still take lessons myself and always value new perspectives. If you’re serious about producing, DM me, and we can set up a quick call to discuss your goals with music production :)

I was hoping maybe someone could help point me in some direction based on your own experiences. Years ago I had been dealing with acid reflux but it seemed to go away. Earlier this year under a period of extreme stress I started to get something I thought was reflux but am no unsure. 

  
I was dealing with tightness in my chest (center), and sometimes on the far left side. I got my heart checked one time at the ER and everything was fine. CBC counts were also fine. 

Here are the full symptoms I tend to get:

* Sore Throat
* Burning tongue
* Clearing through
* Coughing
* Congestion at times
* A feeling of breathlessness (I can actually breath fine but it sort of feels that way)
* And sometimes I get a feeling of something sharp (best way to explain it) at the back left of my throat but not often

  
My doctor put me on Omeprazole 20mg for a few months. I was doing that, Gaviscon before bed and Pepcid at night and I definitely felt better. I wanted to see if I could get further diagnosis as the doctor was sort of uninterested in the whole thing so I had an upper endoscopy on Wednesday. I came off PPI's on like Saturday maybe? and Pepcid 2 days before.. and congestion came back and my throat. The endoscopy itself was clear. I asked him to take as much of a peek at my larynx as possible and he couldn't find anything. 

The congestion is the weird part. at around like 4:30pm today I almost couldn't breath out of my nose. I used a nose spray like Afrin (which I haven't had to use in awhile), and it cleared me right up, and my throat felt better too.

I've asked my doctor to refer me to an ENT but in Canada that can seemingly take forever. Not sure if I should go back on the PPI or not? I've made some dietary changes like cutting out coffee and alcohol but still not sure what to do. Anyone have any advice / experiences similar that could lead me in the right direction?

Update: I did forget to mention one more important thing going on in my mouth. I currently have braces but some oral orthotics over my back molars to help fix my TMD. I have this year seemed to get an irritated back of tongue which causes at times a white buildup back there. It’s confirmed not candida though.

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

Reach out. I’d really love to hear from you.",0,1752798733.0,r4r,1,0.5,False

1m2o5n8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1m2o5n8/aita_for_not_backing_down/,AITA for Not Backing Down?,"Hey guys, this is my first reddit post, and I'd just really love some outside insight because I think I may be overreacting. I'll be changing names and a few small details for anonymity. (TW for mentions of abuse).

My family is very close, and I (30F) feel incredibly lucky to have a support system that many do not. We gather regularly for birthdays, holidays, the occasional random dinner, sporting events for the kids, etc. I talk to my parents once a day, sometimes even multiple times a day, and check in with my siblings regularly. We vacation together once or twice a year, do group gifts and outings, and just generally like each other.

My parents are amazing. They have raised outspoken, hardworking kids, love their grandchildren and spoil them like all good grandparents do, and did everything they could for me and my siblings growing up. We may not have had as much as others, but my siblings and I never noticed because we had a loving household, good food on the table, and our parents worked hard to provide for us.

That being said, my parents did raise independent people who always speak their minds. This is where my problem lies. There are many, many things that, despite our closeness, my parents, siblings, and I will simply never agree on. We have vastly different communication styles and there is also an age gap between myself and my siblings, me being the youngest by several years. I think this plays into my issue as well.

My eldest sibling (40) is more of an avoider. My other sibling (38) is very standoffish and occassionally down right aggressive. My mom is someone who likes to sit the fence, though she tends to side with my dad whenever an argument arises, simply, in my opinion, because she's the one who lives with him and has to hear him complain. And my dad is, to put it mildly, very quick to anger. So quick that it has even begun to affect his health in recent years and he has had to work to make changes. 

I, on the other hand, spent three years in an abusive relationship when I was younger- verbally, emotionally, physically - you name it. This obviously led to a lot of trauma on my end, strained relationships outside of my romantic relationship, and a need to learn how to deal with my feelings in a more healthy way. Because of this, I'm the only one in my family who has ever been to therapy, and I realized then that the way I had been taught to deal with conflict (ignore it or yell louder than the other person) was not healthy.

It took a lot of hard work and self correction, but I have gained the skills I need to process my feelings in real time and express myself in a more mature, level headed way that leads to conflict resolution instead of only conflict. But I'm not perfect, I'm certainly no saint, and I can definitely still get upset.

As mentioned, despite all the love we have for one another, we do not have much in common outside of being family. That can be really fun, honestly, because conversations are normally interesting. But then things like politics come up, or someone offends someone else with an offhand comment about their interests, or someone else is tired and grumpy so they snap about the littlest things and that makes the next person angry, so on and so forth. Normal family arguments (I think).

I also mentioned how my dad's temper has gotten the better of his health these last few years. A lifetime of screaming over a missed turn, or stomping and slamming and ranting and raving through the house over a lost item or a broken something, never sure which of his three kids was to blame, has made his blood pressure far too high for a healthy man of his age.

One of my earliest memories is me and my siblings in the backseat of the car as my dad screamed in the passenger seat about my my mom's driving, pulling mail she had in the visor down and throwing it all around as she went down the road. Or the time my parents were arguing over something I can't even remember now, and he flipped the coffee table and left us crying and waiting up for hours. Or the times I'd hear them screaming (again, mom was more avoidant, so it was mostly my dad) and cry in the bathroom until they stopped. Or when we were watching my nephew, and he got mad at me and threw one of my nephew's hard cover books at me while I was holding him. Or the way he'd scream until his face was red the whole way home after I had struck out at a softball game. Little things, but they paint a bigger picture.

I don't say all this to make my dad sound bad- he grew up with a father that makes him seem like Mr. Rogers. He may not have broken every cycle of abusive behavior, but I can tell you he certainly broke a LOT of them. But for awhile, he did seem to be getting worse with age, and as the youngest by a decade, I do feel that regression caused a lot of strain on our relationship as I grew up. I feel like my siblings got a different dad than I did sometimes, if that makes sense.
Because of all this, and because of my very different set of beliefs, when my dad and I do argue, it can be a lot. Yelling and cursing and regretful words. I was alone with him and my mom for eight years after my second oldest sibling moved out, and he got progressively angrier as time went on. 

My therapy didn't just address the romantic abuse I endured, but also helped me to unpack that my communication style wasn't healthy to begin with, and allowed me to come to terms with the fact that even though I truly love him and my mom, they weren't always the best examples to follow.
Now my dad is on medication and has undergone medical treatments for his heart and blood pressure, and it really has helped his mood. Instead of running white hot all the time, he's more a soft yellow that can still heat up to red, but is almost never as bad as he used to be. He actively works to avoid getting upset, but once he's there, he still struggles to pull back- something we have in common.

Tonight we argued about something incredibly stupid. I mean just the most inane thing you could imagine, but he followed the same pattern he always does, and I just couldn't take it. Often times, because of his health and my own growth journey, I will end a phone call or remove myself from a situation entirely when he starts to get worked up, because after all my progress, he can still get under my skin and I act in a way I'm never proud of. Tonight though, I just didn't feel like letting him get away with his same MO. So here's where I may be in the wrong.

We were talking about, if you can believe it, a record player. When I was in middle school, and even now, I loved old school anything. My grandpa had gifted me his old record player around this time, a big, 60s style record player with the original speakers hooked up and several records to play on it.

I set it up in my room with the help of my dad, and he was there when I played the very first record on it. He and my mom took me to go buy new records and everything.
Then, while I was away on a school trip, my parents ended up getting evicted after our landlord sold our house without telling us, and they had to move during the week I was gone. I came back to a whole new house, new room, and no record player. My dad told me it was in the garage, that he'd help me hook it back up. He never did. Eventually, he told me a speaker was missing. I told him I'd find another one day, but we could still hook it up with just the one. That never happened, either. After several months of avoiding it, he told me it was a ""piece of junk,"" and it was broken. Sixteen year old me was heartbroken, and then annoyed when, a year later, he had hooked it up in the room where he and my mom and their friends would get together to have a drink and hang out. But that was a long time ago, and I got over it.

Tonight, when it came up, I jokingly said, ""Oh, the record player you and mom kept for yourselves?"" I was laughing and everything. He got defensive and said, ""That piece of crap? It never worked."" 

I heard his tone of voice, so I immediately told him I didn't want to argue, but it had most definitely worked in the past. I then went on to remind him of how he had helped me hook it up when I first got it, a fun memory that made no further mention of them using it for themselves, trying to diffuse the situatuon. He then called me a liar, said that it had never worked, and that he would never steal garbage from someone.

I should have let it drop there. But it was a gift from my grandpa, and I hate being called a liar. So I calmly told him I wasn't upset, but it wasn't fair to call me a liar when I was clearly the only one who remembered what happened. He said, ""What happened then?"" all angry like, and I took the bait. I told him it had worked before I left for my trip, and when I came back I was told it was missing parts and then told that it didn't work until they thought I'd forgotten and set it up for themselves.

At this point, he started yelling. I was a liar, and I was accusing him of breaking a gift I'd been given (he was refusing to admit they had used it, so he focused on the part where I mentioned being told it didn't work - selective hearing at its finest). He does this thing where if you disagree with him, he gets all sarcastic and preachy, saying things like ""I guess I'm just a dumb piece of shit then, I'm just a stupid asshole,"" blah blah blah. I reiterated, calmly, that I didn't want to argue with him, but I didn't like being called a liar, especially over something so dumb. While we were talking, my mom had apparently entered the room, and he said to her, ""She's mad and saying I destroyed all her stuff and I'm a piece of shit."" That's where I lost my composure.

You see, my whole childhood, my dad was self-employed. Mom worked regular hours, so after my siblings moved out, it would just be us until she got home from work, and he did this exact thing constantly. He'd pick a fight- not that I was innocent, I'm sure having a smart mouthed kid with vastly different opinions around all the time was frustrating- and then after he had me angry to the point of screaming right along with him, my mom would get home and he'd blame the whole thing on me. Then my siblings would find out, and over time, it became everyone's opinion that I was just difficult and impossible to talk to. I only got angrier and more resentful, and what they thought of me started to feel true.

The decisions I've made in my life are my own, and I take responsibility for each and every one of them, but I can honestly say I don't think I ever would have made the decisions that led to me moving out at 18 to live with an abusive 30 year old if it weren't for the fact I felt ostracized at home.

So tonight, when he did that same thing he's done my whole life, over something as stupid as a record player, I just kind of lost it. I try especially hard when it comes to him because I love him, and I worry about his health, but I just couldn't let it go. I demanded to be put on speaker, loudly, so that my side could be heard. I was tired of him always controlling the narrative, and I guess I was especially spiteful because I've worked harder than anyone in my family to learn how to communicate in a healthy way, all to have him lie and make me the problem, again. I can't remember exactly what I said at that point, but I basically demanded an apology, saying it wasn't right for him to twist my words and tell someone I'd said things not even remotely close to anything that had come out of my mouth. What did he say in response? ""I'm sorry if I broke your record player, I don't remember.""

I told him that was a half assed apology, and I'd made it clear it wasn't the record player that was upsetting me in that moment. It was the way he insisted on arguing, only to make me the villain in the story, like he always, always does. He started up again with his sarcastic self depreciation and I cut him off to basically say ""fuck you"" and that I didn't want to hear from them (my fence sitting mom included) until they'd been to therapy and started working on their communication issues.

I really can't stress enough that my family is close, maybe too close for how different we all are. I've been given a good life, and I have the values that make me a hardworking person, able to provide for myself independently because of how my parents raised me. I know that they love me, and I love them very much. But I'm tired of being told that I'm the source of conflict that my dad has started only minutes after he started it.

He convinces himself so thoroughly that I really do think he believes that I'm the liar and aggressive and the problem, and that assuredness makes others in my family believe him too. Having a conversation with him feels a bit like losing my mind because he just argues in circles until everything points back to me. I don't want to go low or no contact, but I really feel like it's not healthy of either of us to communicate until he he seeks professional help, because literally any conversation with him could randomly turn into an argument. It makes talking to him stressful and a bit of a chore.

So, AITA for taking the bait and not backing down over something so silly? And WIBTA if I follow through on limiting contact until changes are made?

It all happened when my physician recommenced me to quit caffeine before pregnancy and recommended few things around it. Let me tell you it’s super hard to do it but I’d no choice honestly. No palpitations anymore good god! And no more jitters and brain fog. I’ve also started doing gym now. Instead of spending $210 on coffee, I rather spend that on açaí and gym.

That's what the doctor said. He's 67, a close family friend, and got diagnosed stage four June 22nd just after he retired. He was initially taking pills to regulate his blood sugar so he can get chemo. Pancreatic cancer is so quick, it's insane. In the span of two weeks, he went from being able to walk to falling down and not being able to stand up. His wife couldn't pick him up and she had to drive to our house to get my dad (my mom and I are in China and dont get back for a week) and he had to help lift him up. ""He's free to eat anything he wants"" is the worst thing I've ever heard. It's so bad. It means we've given up, doesn't it? We're done. The doctor said a week ago he has a few months. Now, the doctor says it's end of August at most. He used to come to our house for barbecues all the time. We're gonna go there before he passes and make steak, and mashed potatoes, and ice cream for dessert. This cancer is just so brutal. I hope happy guy gets to enjoy all the ice cream and lamb chops and coffee he wants. Those words just feel like a death sentence. It means there's no point in trying anymore. Eating anything means blood sugar doesnt go lower which means no chemo, no surgery, no treatment, no hope. What do you even do in this situation? What do you hope for? The only things to hope for are death related. I'm sorry this is all over the place. ",3,1752798553.0,pancreaticcancer,0,1.0,False

I’ve done some research and it seems like most places are closed during the off season. We are okay with mostly remaining at the hotel property given most things will be closed - we specifically chose to visit this hotel for its amenities and great design. This is a pit stop for us as we travel Europe during the winter time. Another thing to note is we are visiting from San Francisco and are used to cold weather. 

Would love some recommendations of places to visit/restaurants to try! We are big on architecture (less beach people). Will there be any coffee shops that will be open then? What are your favorite restaurants? How is the night scene?

Given that most things will be closed, should we bother with renting a car?

Appreciate any help in advance :)

We got a new Starbucks DM about 1.5 years ago, and ever since she took over our district we’ve been reprimanded in various ways. We’ve been fixing everything she wants but it’s still never good enough for her. We get no recognition for the changes we’ve made and instead given another list of everything else that’s wrong. 

- First, it was because our customer connection score was low (it was). We were told baristas need to say welcome the second a customers foot touches the inside of the store, and that’s why our score was low. Saying it once they’re a few steps in was “too late”. Then SB moved to the new scoring system and we have been 95% or higher in customer satisfaction so she’s suddenly dropped that issue.

- We created internal customer surveys with the exact same questions to prove our customers were happy. She LOVED the surveys, took photos of them to show other stores, etc. Now a year later she told us they were “unapproved surveys” and to remove them.

- She put us on a notice of noncompliance to revoke our license because a partner did not put the steam wand out at the end of the milk steaming routine.

- Makes unannounced visits to the store at least 2x per month, each visit lasting 4 hours or so. She expects me to abandon my other job responsibilities to sit with her for hours on end. I’ve asked her to put these on my calendar if she is expecting me to be there, so I can move my other meetings/duties around, but she refuses. Ive started only attending when I actually can, as I feel it’s disrespectful to my time. 

- She pointed at some water spots on a step ladder in the BOH and told us she is calling EcoSure because we are “obviously not cleaning”.

- Is now requiring our SM to wear all black daily. But nowhere in the new dress code do I see anything regarding SM dress code?

She tells us we are her highest sales store. Our MOP averages 70% for the day, while the rest of her district maxes out at 26%. 

At this point I’m at a loss of what to do or how to be successful under her guidance. My SM goes home crying every time she visits. We fix every little detail but it’s never enough.

So I researched the best color for a north-facing room without a lot of natural light and landed on SW ""Greek Villa"". Then I saw their paint prices and wound up with ""Swiss Coffee"" from Benjamin Moore/Ace Hardware. 

I cleaned, re-primed, and have on a coat of the Swiss Coffee. It's already so much better! Less like the Pit of Despair and more like a utility room of sorts.

1m2nviy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2nviy,Am I blowing this up or is my sister just exhausting to deal with?,"I come to this sub for the tea, so I figured it’s time I give my own. I’m looking for advice on how to move forward with my relationship with my sister, which has been rocky for basically our whole lives. The situation I’m about to share isn’t the worst thing she’s done, but I feel like her behavior is getting more and more offhanded. I’m at the point where once I move out of our shared place in September, I’m considering blocking her number so I don’t have to deal with any of the drama she might throw my way while I’m in grad school. But I also want to check myself and see if I’m blowing this out of proportion or if I really am the asshole.

The latest situation started because I made a comment about her wasting water. She has a habit of turning the shower on and leaving it running for an upwards of 30 minutes with the door open before even getting in. Once, she even flooded the upstairs bathroom because she left the shower head pointed outward. The water leaked through the floor, caused damage downstairs, and almost ruined my books. I study environmental science and conservation, so water waste is something I care about. I’m not out here trying to change people, but I do point things out.

The other day, she was talking to me while her shower was running, and I commented on it. Later, she texted asking me to stop commenting on her water use. I said no and explained why. That’s where the screenshots started. After that, I got the silent treatment for two weeks to start.

During this time, my siblings wanted to celebrate me graduating with my bachelor’s and my little brother graduating high school. My other sister said she would be here at a certain time, but when I asked where she was, she said she was at a coffee shop with *this* sister. I expressed my feelings to my other sister because they ditched a celebration partly for me and didn’t even invite me and she genuinely apologized.

We were both at an event with my dad, and he noticed the tension. I said I genuinely didn’t know what was wrong. Later, I guessed it might be the water conversation, but I thought surely it wasn’t that serious. Then my other sister confirmed that yes, it was. My dad agreed that it was on my sister to fix things with me.

On top of everything, my stepmother passed away from a stroke last December and my stepfather is on his death bed from cancer as we speak. My siblings and I drove down to see my mother and stepfather while this sister pointedly took a plane. While there, there were two different nights where she demanded a ride from my mother. One night she proceeded to snatch her wine out of my mom's hand claiming that she was only here for a weekend and now that my mom is driving she cant drink it. The other night she was being extremely passive aggressive asking my mother why she came down here when she had work the next day after my mother asked her why she got a plane back at 5 am. I was in the room for both incidents. While I talked to my mom about the little things she brought up.

What’s really getting to me is that my sister claims she doesn’t want to have a “back and forth,” but then she went on to list off things I supposedly did while visiting my mom. After listing them, she just ended the conversation by saying, “I said what I said,” like that’s supposed to be the end of it.

I will also say, I talked to my mom about the situations she is accusing me of and my mom was confused when I brought it up and saying she did not in any way feel hurt. I paid almost $100 for food for everybody when down there so I was surprised when my sister brought that up. And I was not gone for hours after either, but I did make sure my mom was ok with the amount of time I was gone, nonetheless.

When talking to my mom she is so quick to defend my sister. I don’t understand how she and some of my other siblings can’t see or choose not to see her behaviors towards me and others around her. I feel like I’m not being fairly represented, and it’s like my sister can act however she wants, be rude to anyone, and still get what she wants without consequence.

That said, I’m not even sure what I want to happen here. I just know I’m tired when around her. Mentally and emotionally.  

**Additional context:** My sister has always been self centered and bougie; this has been confirmed by family, friends, and even exes. I was talking to one ex about the situation and he was like, “well she has always been that way”. So point. But as of recent, when I have been with her she had had zero consideration for the people around her and acts out at the smallest things.

**Why the silent treatment hit so hard:** when we were teenagers there was one time she baked cookies that I had bought and proceeded to try to eat them. I told her those were my cookies that I bought with my own money and she ignored me and tried to go to the room and eat them anyway. I lost my temper, smacked the plate out of her hand, and the cookies went flying. After that, she didn’t speak to me for over two years. Not an exaggeration. I admit my reaction then was out of line, but the fact that she iced me out for years over it shows how extreme she can be.

1m2nu6q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1m2nu6q/the_geography_of_touch/,The Geography of Touch,"There are maps we never learn to read—

the cartography of a palm pressed

against another palm, the longitude

of fingers finding their way through hair,

the careful meridians we trace

along the curve of a shoulder blade.



Love is this: the way you fold

your worry into the space between

my ribs, how I become a harbor

for your restless thoughts at 3 AM.

It is the archaeology of small gestures—

coffee made without asking,

the sweater left draped over the chair

like a question mark of care.



We are all just houses

with windows flung wide,

hoping someone will notice

the light we've left burning.

And when they do—when they choose

to walk through our unlocked doors—

we discover that home was never

a place but a recognition:

the way your laugh sounds

like coming back to myself.



In the grocery store, I watch

couples navigate the narrow aisles

of their shared life, reaching

around each other for milk,

for bread, for the ordinary sacraments

that make a Tuesday feel

like a small miracle.



This is what we're really doing—

learning the dialect of each other's

silence, becoming fluent

in the grammar of presence.

Love is not the lightning

but the steady current

that keeps the lights on

when the storms pass through.



And perhaps that's enough:

to be witnessed in our stumbling,

to have someone say yes

to the beautiful disaster

of being human together,

to find in another's eyes

the reflection of our own

wild, persistent hope.

Neither of us are famous, but he’s definitely more successful and desired in the industry than I am. I was completely stupefied by him when I met him; he’s the most beautiful person I’ve ever seen, and I barely knew how to act around him, but we made a connection nonetheless and he asked me out for coffee. Once I got over my initial shock, I found he was actually one of the nicest and smartest people I’ve ever met, and we clicked like hell on our first date. He’s sweet, gentle, very intelligent and well-informed while being humble about it, and our senses of humor meshed perfectly. Long story short we fell in love, moved in together, and have been together for 3 years.

We went out of town for an audition of his, and we had a free evening to explore the area. We went on a hike on a trail near our airbnb. Context is while he’s more fit than me, I’m more outdoorsy than he is. We got to a part of the trail where there was a bend that went on a pretty steep downhill, but the part where it bent was blocked by a fallen tree. I jumped down from the upper part of the trail onto the lower part (about 6 feet) and encouraged him to follow. He said “are you sure?” and I told him he’d be fine. He jumped, his feet slipped when he hit the trail, and he fell on his face. I was immediately terrified and helped him up, and thankfully he was fine, but he did have two cuts on his face and several cuts on his hand and wrist. Nothing was bleeding or anything, but suffice it to say you really really do not want visible cuts on your face for an audition. 

I apologized profusely to him and took us back to the airbnb immediately, but he was (rightfully) very, very pissed. It was late by then and we both went to sleep. His audition was early in the morning (7). I woke up around 9, and I was feeling really guilty so I made us as nice a lunch I could at the bnb, and I texted him around 11 asking when he’d be back. He texted back saying he wouldn’t be; he was going out to lunch with the people from the studio. 

I texted him again at 4:30 asking how things were and when he’d be back, and he replied that he was staying out with people from the studio. I was freaking out internally at this point, but I said ok, just keep me updated, and I love you.

At around 8 I got a text from an online acquaintance who works as a PA at that studio, along the lines of “hey, I hope you guys are broken up or something or else I really hate to tell you this, but I’m seeing [name] with a girl and they’re being extremely touchy and flirty.”

At this point I called and texted him many times, and he didn’t pick up or respond. He got back around 5am, we had our flight back which I was asleep for since I’d spent the entire night awake and freaking out, and finally when we got home I asked him outright if he’d cheated on me. He got angrier than I’ve ever seen him, told me I was just trying to make up justifications when I was the one who fucked him over. I did not believe him. We both needed space to cool down, so I went to a friend’s house to stay the night. That night, my PA friend texted me again saying that another PA had overheard him booking a hotel with the girl from before. 

I went back home and showed him the texts, and we were both completely exhausted and emotionally dead at this point, and he said yes, he did sleep with another girl. 

He brought up that since he’s black and I’m white, he feels there are a lot of things he can’t connect with me about, and the girl he cheated on me with was black and it was refreshing to talk to someone who understood, since his corner of the industry is overwhelmingly white. He also said he feels like I care less about my career than he does, and I project that onto him. Honestly I was so numb and out of it through all this I only registered the broader points. He cried, told me he was so sorry and he only wants to be with me, etc. etc. 

I don’t want this relationship to be over. I love him more than I’ve ever loved anyone else. He’s my best friend. We’ve been through a lot together—he had a near-death experience due to an undiagnosed chronic illness midway through our relationship and I saw him go into shock and have to have his heart chemically restarted. I slept in the windowsill of his hospital room. I’ve seen him doubled over turning gray from pain, shitting and pissing his bed, going briefly psychotic, and he fucks someone else the second I fuck up for a moment. It feels real, but it hurts. 

I’ve been staying with a friend. He’s been desperately texting me asking to talk. I don’t know. I’m tired.

## Key Features Analysis

the features of a glass tray dictate its versatility and suitability for various tasks.Several crucial aspects deserve careful consideration.**Material quality:** The quality of the glass is paramount, affecting durability, clarity, and overall aesthetic appeal. Tempered glass is a popular choice, offering enhanced resistance to breakage and thermal shock, making it ideal for serving hot or cold items. Lead-free crystal glass, on the other hand, provides extraordinary clarity and brilliance, making it a preferred option for decorative trays. The thickness of the glass also plays a role, with thicker trays being generally more robust.

**size and Shape:** Glass trays come in a multitude of sizes and shapes, from small, square trays designed for individual servings to large, rectangular platters suitable for buffets. Circular trays are frequently enough favored for serving drinks or displaying items on a coffee table, while tiered trays offer a unique and space-saving way to present desserts or appetizers. Consider the intended use when determining the appropriate size and shape.**Design and Style:** The design and style of a glass tray can substantially impact its aesthetic appeal. Minimalist designs featuring clean lines and simple shapes are versatile and complement a wide range of décor styles. Ornate designs with intricate patterns, etched details, or metallic accents can add a touch of elegance and sophistication. The color of the glass, whether clear, tinted, or mirrored, also contributes to the overall aesthetic.

**Handles and Edges:** Many glass trays feature handles, which enhance portability and ease of use, especially when serving heavier items. The handles can be made of glass,metal,or other materials,each offering a distinct look and feel. The edges of the tray are also an critically important consideration. Smooth, rounded edges minimize the risk of chipping or breakage, while raised edges prevent items from sliding off the tray.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of a glass tray is a crucial factor, particularly if it will be used to serve heavier items such as large platters of food or multiple bottles of beverages. Check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure that the tray can safely support the intended load. Consider the thickness of the glass and the construction of the base when assessing weight capacity.

My family and I (my wife, our 4-year-old daughter, and our 8-month-old daughter) will be visiting the North Island in early August as we explore the idea of relocating from the U.S. We're hoping to get a feel for life in New Zealand and would love some recommendations on areas to check out during our visit — especially neighborhoods that are family-friendly, have good schools, and reasonable commute times. We expect to primarily explore the Auckland and Hamilton areas, but would certainly consider others that might be a good fit for us.

I’m a general dentist with a strong background in surgery, implants, and IV sedation, and my wife is a clinical psychologist specializing in the treatment of trauma. If there are any dentists or psychologists in this group, we’d be incredibly grateful to buy you a coffee and hear about your experiences — what it's like to practice in NZ, how the healthcare systems differ, the culture around work-life balance, and any advice you might have for overseas professionals considering a move.

Thanks in advance for your help — we’re really looking forward to exploring your beautiful country!

1m2nium,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m2nium/do_electric_kettles_use_a_lot_of_electricity/,Do electric kettles use a lot of electricity?,"When I first started using an electric kettle, I was worried about how much electricity it might use. After all, heating water takes energy, right? But after doing some research and using mine for a while, I've found that electric kettles are actually pretty efficient.

Electric kettles use about 1200-1500 watts when they're running. That sounds like a lot, but they heat water so quickly that they're not on for very long. Most kettles take just 2-3 minutes to boil water. So even though they draw a good amount of power, the total energy used is relatively small.

Compared to stovetop kettles or microwaves, electric kettles are more energy-efficient for boiling water. They heat only the amount of water you need and shut off automatically when it's done. No wasted energy keeping a burner hot or heating up the whole microwave.

The actual electricity cost depends on your local rates, but it typically works out to just a few cents per use. For me, it's less than 5 cents to boil a full kettle. Over a year of daily use, that adds up to about $15-20 in electricity costs. Not bad for something I use multiple times every day.

Of course, the exact amount depends on how often you use it and how much water you boil each time. But in general, electric kettles won't make a huge impact on your power bill.

One thing to keep in mind is the quality of your kettle. Cheaper models might be less efficient or take longer to heat up. A good electric kettle will heat water quickly and maintain the temperature well. This means less energy wasted overall.

If you're in the market for an efficient electric kettle, I've had great experiences with the ones from this store: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They have a range of options that are both energy-efficient and durable.

To save even more energy, only boil as much water as you need each time. Don't fill it up if you're just making one cup of tea. And if you're really keen on saving power, you can unplug the kettle when not in use to avoid any standby power draw.

In the end, I've found that the convenience of an electric kettle far outweighs the small amount of electricity it uses. It's faster than other methods, and I can set it and forget it while I do other things. Plus, with precise temperature control, I get perfect water for different types of tea and coffee every time.

So if you're on the fence about getting an electric kettle because of energy concerns, don't worry too much. They're an efficient way to boil water, and the impact on your electricity bill will be minimal. Just choose a good quality kettle and use it wisely, and you'll be enjoying quick, easy hot water without any guilt about your energy use.",1,1752796951.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False

1m2nf7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_Relationships/comments/1m2nf7n/aita_for_ending_a_friendship_with_my_best_friend/,AITA for ending a friendship with my best friend over workplace boundaries and refusing to tell her what I suspected about her boyfriend?,"I (25F) work at a large retailer along with my boyfriend “Todd” (26M), my former best friend “Carmen” (28F), and her boyfriend “Trevor” (30M). Todd and I are supervisors; Carmen and Trevor are hourly employees. We all met through this job and became close friends before Todd and I were promoted.

Even after our promotions, we stayed close — grabbing drinks after work, dinners, etc. At our company, moving up requires rotating through different departments and locations. Todd was rotated into Carmen’s department, becoming her direct supervisor.

At first, things were fine. But coworkers began noticing Carmen slacking — showing up late, taking long breaks, doing the bare minimum — and questioned why she seemed to get special treatment. No one knew about their friendship. Todd tried to be fair, giving her gentle reminders and nudges. She pushed back every time.

Eventually, Todd asked me to talk to her since we were close. Over coffee, I gently explained the team had noticed her performance and it was putting Todd in a tough spot. I emphasized we just wanted to preserve both the work environment and our friendship.

She got defensive and accused us of being on a “power trip.” (Important context: she previously held Todd’s role but stepped down due to stress.) I reminded her of how hard the role had been for her, hoping to find common ground — but she took it as a dig. Then she threatened to report Todd for harassment, claiming her coworkers had never complained to her directly. That scared me — a formal complaint could seriously hurt Todd’s career.

I tried to de-escalate and said I’d pass along her concerns. Later, Todd and I both felt her threat was manipulative, but since I cared about her, he agreed to tread lightly.

Her behavior worsened. She started openly challenging Todd in front of coworkers and refusing basic requests. Todd, who avoids conflict and knew how much she meant to me, tried to be patient.

Around this time, she also started venting to me about “her boss” — obviously Todd. She mocked his leadership style and rolled her eyes over basic expectations. It was uncomfortable being the person she vented to about my boyfriend. I gently asked her not to put me in that position, and she accused me of “not being a girls’ girl” and choosing my boyfriend over her. That stung. I wasn’t trying to take sides — just set a boundary.

Todd and I decided to scale back double dates and hangouts. I still saw her on my own, but much less often.

Then I got rotated into Trevor’s department at a different store. At first, he was a solid worker. He’d ask for last-minute favors like shift swaps or excusing late clock-ins — nothing unusual. He frequently left early, and I’d adjust the schedule when I could; otherwise, he used sick time. It was low-conflict.

Then, during one of our solo hangouts, Carmen vented about how Trevor’s constant overtime was affecting their relationship. I was confused — Trevor was part-time, working about 24 hours a week, and often left early. I didn’t say anything, but I was 100% certain he hadn’t worked a single overtime shift under me. I made the schedule and reviewed timecards. In fact, he averaged 4-hour shifts due to frequent early clock-outs.

I started taking mental notes and compared them with Todd’s records. Sure enough, Trevor always left early on days Carmen worked late. It looked like he was telling her he was working overtime when he wasn’t — and possibly lying about where he was.

Here’s where I might be the AH: I never told Carmen. After how explosive she got last time, I didn’t feel safe confronting her. Plus, some of Trevor’s absences were marked as medical, and I could’ve gotten in trouble for discussing confidential scheduling info. If they went to upper management, I could’ve been fired.

Part two: I didn’t want to lie, but I also couldn’t be honest. So after discussing with Todd, I texted Carmen explaining that maintaining a close friendship while supervising her and Trevor had become too complicated. I said maybe we could reconnect once we were no longer in those roles.

She didn’t take it well. She accused me of acting superior and being on a high horse. I let her vent, told her I loved her, and said I’d reach out again if the time felt right.

Six months later, Todd and I were both moved to new departments. I reached out, apologized for how it all went down… and never got a response.

A good handful of my relatives are recently getting diagnosed. I understand you guys can't diagnose me but wondering if any of you relate to this. 

I'm the friend that always has SOME kind of relationship problem. I thought it was the trauma (I have C-PTSD), I thought it was attachment issues, but now I'm wondering if it's because the way I relate to someone in general is very specific and not quite normal. 

Sometimes I'm the one being too cold, sometimes I'm the one wanting too much.

I seek to spend time with people I like but only about, once every 2-3 weeks. Soooooometimes once a week on the rare cycle. Anything more than that and I feel like I need to tap out. I don't spend that much time with my dearest friends, so that to me is 'committed relationship' level but I've frequently been told I'm too cold, and that I'm too self-absorbed. I reply to most messages as needed in level of urgency, USUALLY within that day even if late, but I will just forget about a message I left on read for hours. But I genuinely struggle to want to do any more than that. 

I shudder at the thought of sharing one bedroom. This is why I can't imagine myself fitting into the nuclear family type marriage. But it's not like I want to be alone ALL the time, I just think it'd be cool to sometimes visit each other's bedrooms and sometimes get a good night's sleep? 

Probably because of everything on top as well, but I also tended to get attached to people who were apparently signalling very clearly to me that what they wanted was a fwb situation, I just had ZERO idea. It was confusing to me because they'd spend time with me without 'just' sleeping with me but as soon as I spoke about my feelings for them they'd zone out and I'd realise. Now I'm a bit better at catching it early but I get angry at myself for not knowing these signs earlier (it was apparently incredibly obvious to my friends when I'd tell them about these people but they didn't want to 'break it' to me). Is it so hard to just say ""I want a fwb"" in words?? Cause that's totally fine for you to want. 

And still, I get quite confused why this 'commitment' thing is so important, if we're spending that much time with each other why can't we accept that we have affection for each other for now, even if someone better might come later? Why is that bad? Also, why does there have to be a ""future plan"" for relationships to be important if we're both unsure about the future? Super confusing. 

That point isn't limited to romantic relationships, it's friendships too. I feel like it's very normal for friends to drift in and out as your life drifts too. I really hate it when some people insist on just doing EVERYTHING together for no reason to be ""besties"". I get the need for a catch-up now and then but it's hell for me if I like, have to go to a museum of an artist I literally don't care about or something to have that chat. 

I want everyone to be happy, I don't need to be hanging out all the time to wish that for you, why don't we just go and do our things in our own way and we have a coffee if it feels good to us both? If either one of us feels off in that moment to hang out then it's fine.

I’ve tried medication before, but it didn’t work for me — either it messed with my body in other ways, or it just wasn’t effective long-term.

I’ve also tried coffee. Coffee does help suppress my appetite, but only to a point — eventually, it stops working. Yerba Mate has helped more consistently. It not only curbs my appetite, but also helps me feel emotionally stable and mentally clear. It’s the closest thing I’ve found to feeling “in control.”

But here’s the problem: even on days when I’ve eaten more than enough (like 1800+ calories), I still feel physically sick, like that gnawing, nauseous feeling you get when you’ve eaten way too little — except I haven’t. I know I’ve eaten enough. 

Without the Yerba, I’d be ravenous, (even though I’ve had enough food. It’s like my body isn’t satisfied until I’ve had like 3000+ calories). With it, I don’t feel like binging, and emotionally I’m OK, but then I feel sick to my stomach. I recognize the feeling because there was a time - years ago when I was eating too little. 

The thing is, I can’t eat more. I’m already gaining weight, and I know if I go over 1800 calories, it gets worse. But my body keeps sending me these extreme hunger signals that just don’t make sense.

Are my hunger cues broken from years of binge eating? Will this ever go away? Or am I always going to have to feel physically sick just to avoid gaining more weight?",4,1752796621.0,BingeEatingDisorder,2,1.0,False

We will be 3 adult couples (ages 30's -40's) spending 6 nights in NYC. First time there for 2 of the couples. Looking for advice and opinions on suggested itinerary. We are doing a split stay with hotels which is non negotiable (using Hyatt free night certs that are going to expire which is what sparked the trip in the first place) My spouse and I have been put in charge of planning (since we have been before but def not NYC savvy) We have some things included that the other couples have expressed they want to do, which I think is important when you travel with a group. Money is not a huge deal but like to keep things balanced, we enjoy a good social atmosphere and having a drink, also love to eat, but enjoy the idea of hitting several places and having a ""taste"" of different places if that makes sense?

Day 1(Saturday) Travel Day: arriving mid afternoon: Checking in Hyatt House Jersey

Ferry to Manhattan (Brookfield Place) Walk to Los Tacos (Church St) for easy, quick much needed grub

Walk to Canal Street (Shopping Experience a must do for people in our group)

Drinks/Apps @ Starfili Wine Cafe- Tribeca (Happy Hour)

Ferry back to Jersey - check into rooms assuming they were not ready

Pizza (togo) Razza - eat outside at plaza right by hotel for nighttime views of Manhattan then call it a day and get some sleep (maybe get an overpriced drink at the rooftop bar attached to our hotel I dunno)

\-----------------

Day 2 (Sunday)

Morning(ish)- PATH from Exchange to WTC. Walk down to Leo's Bagels but taking a route that allows us to sightsee FIDI along the way (911/Memorial- just a walk by to pay respects, Trinity Church, Wall St (charging bull) etc

Subway to SOHO - initial idea is get to Ceres in time to line up in time to get an acceptable return time for lunch but I'm not losing any sleep over this TBH. Then do some SOHO shopping and EITHER return back to Ceres if it works out BUT if not have lunch at John's on Bleeker

Dante's West Village for Martini Hour and then early ""dinner"" probably around 5:15 in West Village....right now I am thinking Suprema Provisions but talk me off the ledge. Biggest drawing points are atmosphere (love an outdoor/slightly indoor where we can people watch but also realizing we are a party of 6) and obviously food.

Make our way over to McSorley's (must do) for evening drinks

Stop by Old Friends Photo Booth if we are feeling it and it works out

Katz Deli - later evening nosh

Subway back to WTC/PATH Jersey

\*Notes: Obvious long day but we are prepared for that, too much travel back to hotel and out again

\------------------

Day 3 (Monday)

Later Start: Subway to Grand Central - just to see from a tourist standpoint

Grab togo food from Vanderbilt Market, walk to Bryant Park to eat

Visit NYC Public Library (Treasury Exhibit)

Summit One Vanderbilt

Walk to Empire State Building Area

Activity: Electric Shuffle 90min (we have done this at another location and enjoyed) Also Happy Hour

Explore Koreatown

Sunset/Evening Ferry from 34th - Wall Street

Dinner @ Stone Street Tavern

Battery Park/Seaglass Carousel

Subway back to Hotel

\-------------

Day 4 (Tuesday) Check out - PVT Transfer to Park Hyatt

Drop off luggage at hotel, walk to Blank Street Coffee and Liberty Street Bagel - take to Central Park

Make our way up the East Side of Central Park ( the Mall/Bethesda Terrance route) have lunch at Le Pain Quotidien by Sailboat Pond (had originally wanted to do Boathouse but horrible reviews not sure it's worth it but want to have a lunch in central park)

Visit The MET - rooftop drink at some point

Walk back to hotel - check in to rooms, have a break

Dinner at Vida Verde Rooftop (Taco Tuesday) like this vibe and it's walking distance from hotel

Walk down 7th Ave through Time Square

Drinks @ Rudy's Bar and Grill then see what happens or walk back to hotel and call it a day

\--------------------

Day 5 (Wednesday)

Sleep in then take Subway to Chelsea Market

Do a little Food and Wine and exploring at the Market

Walk Highline (had thought about having afternoon drinks at Peak to include access to The Edge but thought this might not be a good idea for time of day and already did Summit...overkill?)

Back to Hotel for Break

Dinner @ La Grande Boucherie (probably overhyped but it's gorgeous and pairs with our Broadway show)

Show: Moulin Rouge 8:30pm/back to hotel

\-----------------

Day 6 (Thursday) Last Full Day

Morning - no plans as of now. Played with idea of just having it open for everyone to do or revisit what they want as couples since we have now been here for a week?

Evening - Dinner @ Soju Haus (non negotiable) love the sharing plates/experience

After Dinner Drinks: 230th Rooftop....I really think this is not ideal but if anyone has a better option for a last night lively ""rooftop"" experience that is not boring I am all ears (that is not in another borough unless you sell me on making the trip out on our last night) also open to anything lively on a Thursday evening that would be a good end to a trip?

\-----------------------

Day 7th - departing a separate times back home (no plans)

Things I had on my radar but could not figure out how to fit in, Comedy Cellar (McDougal), Walking Brooklyn Bridge/ Dumbo, West side of Central Park, Rowboats in Central Park, Happy Hour at Mermaid Upperwest, Ralphs Coffee, Walking around Rockefeller/5th Ave shopping, Roosevelt Island. Since it's a first time experience for the other couples I just want to make sure we are hitting certain things ideal for a first visit.

She, the therapist, is expert in mental and emotional wellbeing. 

Some of the common issues were:

1. “I feel constantly tired, even after a full night of sleep, and I don’t know why.”

2. “I keep overthinking every little decision and it’s starting to paralyze me.”

3. “I’m functioning on the outside, but inside I feel totally disconnected.”

4. “I’m always on edge. The smallest things make me snap lately.”

5. “I’m feeling everything too much. Every little thing feels overwhelming emotionally.”

6. “I’ve lost interest in the things I used to enjoy, and I don’t know what’s wrong with me.”

7. “I don’t know how to relax. Even when I have time off, I feel guilty for not doing more.”

8. “My emotions flip so fast, at times I’m happy then angry then sad. I feel out of control.”

9. “I keep self-sabotaging good things. Every time I get close to progress, I shut down.”

10. “I just feel like I’m drowning in responsibilities and can’t breathe emotionally.”

I did research on some powerful frameworks and crafted a diagnostic interactive prompt. Did some testing by circulating amongst my colleagues and friends and iterated it.

Just copy the prompt and paste it in ChatGPT or any other LLM, hit enter and wait for the response, now add your problem/issue related to mental and emotional wellbeing and go with the diagnostic flow the final outcome will be a well structured, comprehensive finding and solutions report.

Prompt
```
</Role_Objective>
You are a Mental and Emotional Wellbeing Clarity Assistant. Your goal is to guide the user through a compassionate and structured exploration of their current mental and emotional state. You do this by asking one reflective question at a time, uncovering hidden stressors, misaligned thought patterns, emotional bottlenecks, or unmet psychological needs. You utilize gentle coaching, therapy-informed frameworks, and nonjudgmental support.
</Role_Objective>

<Context>
The user is experiencing mental fatigue, emotional stress, mood swings, low motivation, or anxiety but may not know why. They are seeking clarity, relief, and practical emotional regulation strategies. They could be neurodivergent, highly sensitive, burned out, or simply overwhelmed by life.
</Context>

<Instructions>
1. Begin with: “What emotion or mental state feels strongest or most persistent for you today?”
2. Follow up to explore:
   - Physical sensations or somatic signals
   - Thought patterns, inner dialogue, or beliefs
   - Recurring triggers or life stressors
   - Emotional avoidance or suppression
   - Energy patterns (tired but wired, numb, stuck in freeze/fawn, etc.)
3. Apply frameworks as needed:
   - CBT Thought > Feeling > Action loops
   - The Window of Tolerance (hyper/hypoarousal)
   - Emotion Naming (emotional granularity chart)
   - Internal Family Systems (IFS): identify “parts”
   - Polyvagal Theory (safety and nervous system regulation)
4. Explain frameworks simply and gently when introducing.
5. After 3–5 questions and frameworks applied, organize findings into:
   - **Problem Summary** (in emotional and cognitive terms)
   - **Emotional Insights** (what’s happening beneath the surface)
   - **Self-Regulation Tools or Grounding Practices**
   - **Recommended Actions**:
     - Short-Term (1–2 minute resets)
     - Mid-Term (daily rituals or routines)
     - Long-Term (mindset reframes or healing patterns)
   - **Mindset or Mood Trackers** (optional)
6. Offer emotional reframes like: “You’re not weak—you’re carrying more than most can see.”
7. Conclude with encouragement to revisit regularly and build emotional fluency over time.

</Instructions>

<Constrains>
- Ask only one question at a time.
- Avoid diagnostic labels or complex psychological terms unless requested.
- Tailor responses to user’s capacity, tone, and pace.
- Do not overwhelm—support nervous system safety.
</Constrains>

<Output Format>
- Problem Summary
- Emotional Insights
- Self-Regulation Tools
- Recommended Actions (Short-Term / Mid-Term / Long-Term)
- Mood/Emotion Tracker Option
- Closing Reframe or Encouragement
</Output Format>

<Reasoning>
Apply Theory of Mind to analyze the user's request, considering both logical intent and emotional undertones. Use Strategic Chain-of-Thought and System 2 Thinking to provide evidence-based, nuanced responses that balance depth with clarity. 
</Reasoning>
<User Input>
Reply with: ""Please enter your Mental & Emotional Wellbeing request and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific Mental & Emotional Wellbeing process request.
</User Input>

```

Got this haul a couple of days ago from [https://decantbox.com/](https://decantbox.com/)  
Good customer service and fast shipping times. It's a little harder to find decants for clones and decantbox seems to have most, if not all of the one's I wanted to try out.

From most liked to least:

\-GOS Fullhouse  
This scent is a safe blind buy. It's very fresh, clean, and has a great poolside scent. In my opinion, an infallible scent profile.

\-GOS Wildcard

Another great blind buy, in my opinion. This sample set has led me to discover that I love citrus and feminine-leaning scents (hence why this and Fullhouse are in my top 2). It doesn't smell synthetic at all, and has a nice floral tone.

\-Jean Lowe Azure

A fresh scent just like Fullhouse, but with poor longitivity. It smells great, though. It's my runner-up for favorite fresh scent so far out of every fragrance I've smelled. I'd bring a decanter with me while going out and about, though.

\-Khamrah Qahwa

Very strong; one spray was all I needed to start with. I'm glad I bought this instead of Khamrah, because the coffee shines in this variation. I'd be very conservative with the amount you put on.

\-Liquid Brun

Great performance, but not for me. The chocolate notes aren't to my liking, but I understand why this scent is popular; it can be used for a night out in the wintertime.

\-Jean Lowe Vibe

Spicy ginger opening with poor performance, I prefer Imagination's DNA personally.",1,1752796496.0,fragranceclones,1,1.0,False

First ‘twas whales, them hunted down, 



Their bones flung deep outside the town.









 We filled it up with tide born dead, 



Till live ones walked in there instead.









Whale bones rattle under tide, 



They dance when no one’s left behind.









Don’t start the tune. Don’t dig. Behave. 



You can’t unhear \*The Drover’s Grave\*.









My grandmother used to tell me that poem whenever I was misbehaving, fooling around too much or just being a little too loud when I was a kid. She would shout in a way that scared me no matter where I was in the house. I could be upstairs in my bedroom and I would hear her cane hit the floor with a thump before hearing her old shaky voice yell it out at me and every time she would follow up with, ‘Keep up wit what you’re doin’ and you’ll end up in Drover Grave Chris!”



When you're a kid you don’t really think about the words to stuff like that, you just hear the tone its spoken in and it puts a deep fear in you like nothing else in the world could when you're that young. As time went on those words carved their way into my mind, remembering the words to that short little poem each time it was spoken even long after she had stopped speaking them to me once I was old enough to behave.



What was Drover’s Grave? 



I was a teenager when I finally asked my grandmother where the poem came from and what it was about. “Me nan used t’tell me that one when I was just a young one.” I remember her telling me, not an ounce of happiness from her voice as she sat there telling me what she knew. “Some things best left be, Chris. Let a poem be just a poem, b’y.”



She wouldn’t tell me another word about it after that no matter how many times I asked her. I don’t know if it was her trying to protect me back then or if she truly didn’t know anything else beyond what she told me. Either way she took whatever else she knew with her to the grave later that same year, leaving a hole in the family but also a hole in any information I could gain from her. 



God I miss her and now I understand why she never said anything else. It was a mistake trying to find out more after all these years and she was right, some things were best left be.



Most folklore from Newfoundland was made for two things. To keep children from misbehaving or give drunken folk something to blame when they stumble back home or tucked away in the shed late at night. Mermaids, ghosts, Newfoundland fairies, didn’t matter what it was; they all tended to lean into one or the other back then. 



But Drover’s Grave, that one just felt different from all of the other ones I’ve heard before. There was something there and yet I couldn’t figure it out. 



The more I looked the less I found. It was like my grandmother was the only person to remain to know about this place yet she passed this mystery down to me before she passed away. It used to drive me crazy thinking about it back then, what it was about, where it came from, what was Drover’s Grave?



I was at a dead end, there was nothing else to work off of then the very words my grandmother left for me and for a long time it remained like that until a few weeks ago. 



My father is the kind of person who would keep everything we were given and tuck it neatly away in some forgotten corner of the house or shed until the time came to clean it out, like a magpie tucking shiny things away before forgetting about it moments later. He had done this to my grandmother's stuff for years, all of it tucked away in small brown boxes until disaster struck one day with water seeping into the basement. 



We had no clue where the leak was coming from and the job fell on to my shoulders to clear out the small room, my father would eventually dig around in the walls like an axe wielding psycho looking for the last survivor to find the leak and fix it. How cleaning the room was thrown into my lap I will never know, yet it was what I needed to discover more about Drover’s Grave. 



A lot of the stuff my father held on to from my grandmother was junk. Random things he had a hard time getting rid of even if it was simple stuff like mugs, blankets and other items all stuffed into these boxes, but one object stood out from the others. It was a small book-like object tightly wrapped in a black like garbage bag. In a way it looked similar to how the Necronomicon was all wrapped up in the Evil Dead Remake, minus the barbwire’s anyway, but it was for a good reason. 



Inside there was a bible, an old bible. So old that the pages were leaking out of its bindings, the bag being the only thing keeping it together at the time as I very gently pulled it free. I couldn’t tell you just how old this bible was, its pages were stained a golden brown, the cover was barely hanging on for its life and whatever thin metal used to be on the corners of this book were either long gone or simply resting at the bottom of the bag. 



Out of everything this was probably one of those items my father would want to hold on to even with its current condition. I was ready to wrap it up again when one of the pages caught my eye, the corner of it sticking out just a little more than the rest when I noticed it had some sort of writing on it. 



It wasn’t a page at all from the bible, instead it was a single sheet of paper folded up and on that little piece of paper was the poem my grandmother would tell me, but there was more.







First ‘twas whales, them hunted down,



Their bones flung deep outside the town.







 We filled it up with tide born dead, 



Till live ones walked in there instead.







Whale bones rattle under tide,



 They dance when no one’s left behind.







Don’t start the tune. Don’t dig. Behave.



 You can’t unhear \*The Drover’s Grave\*.







Never forget —--------- and the ones Drover’s Grave took.







Obviously I’m not going to give you the name of the place that was written there, especially now. It’s better to keep that secret to myself until the bitter end and maybe, just maybe protect you from seeking it out yourself. 



I hope so anyway.



I couldn’t believe my eyes when I found that sheet of paper tucked away inside that crumbling bible. It must have belonged to my great great grandmother and yet it was the first real thread of information I could work with to figuring out this mystery my grandmother planted inside my mind. I took that little sheet of paper with me and left the bible at my fathers place, reading it over and over again with the village name burned into my mind as I got to work trying to find something, anything that could guide me to solving this mystery. I must have spent nearly three days digging around online, looking up local information, online boards and more. The hunt for Drover’s Grave was stuck in my mind and yet even with this small bit of information I was still having a hard time finding anything. 



Then it hit me.  

  





First ‘twas whales, them hunted down, 



Their bones flung deep outside the town.







Whale hunting.



They would have never mentioned that little bit of information if the village wasn’t involved in whale hunting, dragging them on to shore, butchering them and leaving their bones to bleach in the sun and salt. Whaling was very common in Newfoundland for centuries and even when the practice of it started to decline over time, it never really stopped until the early 1970’s. That little bit of history mixed with the idea of this village being a long forgotten or abandoned place was enough for me to narrow down my search. 



I started scooping up whatever lists of old abandoned whaling villages in Newfoundland that I could find, scraping through every name that popped up in front of me until finally I found it, I actually found it! 



A single name, faded away from time yet the moment my finger tapped on the name and the tiny map showing its location it came to life to me, giving me purpose to seek more once again as I star



Sorry, I forgot what I was going to say there. I can barely hear my own thoughts let alone try and write all of this down for you and it's only getting worse and worse.   

  

Anyway I found it and I was going to make it my goal to find it and see just what Drover’s Grave was once and for all.   

  

I took my time getting ready. Planning out possible routes and area’s I could possibly drive too, packing what I thought I would need, checking out old maps to see if I could get a proper location of the area and eventually turning to Google Maps to see the place.



Google Maps was interesting, I had a clear view of the area itself but it didn't look right. I could spot what looked like old houses but the image of the area was too blurry to really see anything, plus I didn't see any sort of gaping hole Drover's Grave was supposed to be. Either time had eventually filled it up or it was trying to hide itself somehow. In the end I decided to work with an old map once I was ready to head out, having a solid map in hand would probably help more than a digital one in the middle of nowhere.



I was so close to finding this Drover's Grave my grandmother scared me with for so many years now, yet it was the pit of my gut I should have listened to, telling me at the time that this was a bad idea, to stop where I was and leave things be.



Driving there I kept asking myself what I was actually going to find, what was I even expecting to see? The best answer was just a great big hole by the shore line, probably filled in by now with dirt and rocks. Maybe there wasn’t anything there at all and this was just another one of those old folk tales to keep children in place? If Drover Grave was real time had most likely wiped it off the map by now. 



It took the better part of the day just to get close to the area. I spent the night in an old run down motel, which I will never return to again, that seemed to have its best days behind them. When morning came around I was back on the road again with shitty coffee in hand. I was so close to the sight that I was getting excited.



It must have been an hour or two when I finally turned off the main road and started to drive down an old rough path that was tucked into the tree’s pretty well. It was not a fun ride down that path, the road was like a snake trail, turning left and right and left and right over and over again. To my surprise the road ended near an old cabin that had definitely seen better days with the front wall nearly bashed inwards, the door was nothing but splinters behind yellow RCMP tape. What ever happened here I did not want to know as I parked my car close but not too close, something bad happened here and the last thing I needed was to have my tires ripped apart by the broken glass and metal flung everywhere in front of this cabin. 



The place felt off is all.   

  

Once my car was parked I grabbed my gear, slipped my backpack on and checked the direction I needed to go before pushing my way into the forest. Walking through the woods was brutal and you have to understand, Newfoundland tree’s can be rough to get through. Sometimes they're just normal tree’s, enough space to walk through without a worry. But these trees? These trees were clumped together, almost like trying to push through a wall at times with how clustered a lot of them were thanks to the never ending wind some places had. Tree’s here were so tight together they killed each other off, the dead being held up by the lively ones like it was their duty to keep standing against the wind, branches so strong they could cut through your clothing if you pushed hard enough.   

  

Two hours of this type of forest was rough, forcing me to check my compass over and over again just to make sure I was actually going the right way. Took me nearly an hour just to break the tree line and enter a long grassy field where I finally saw it.   

  

Standing out in the distance where the sounds of water echoed towards me was a single standing wall belonging to a house that once stood tall. I had found the village that held Drover’s Grave.



Like most settlements scattered across Newfoundland, nature had reclaimed most of it back but what did remain still stood tall even if it was just a wall or two. Most of the houses and smaller buildings on the outer rim of the village were like that anyway, the further in you got the more you found that still had some of its roof still intact, some even still had windows to my surprise after all these years. Every house was just a slight variant to each other, a large box like house. Some had just one floor but others had two floors. What was more surprising was the fact that some of them still had their original paint on them, faded by now but some of them still showed off the bright yellow, red, blue paint they used, a tradition people now still did to paint their homes in smaller towns of course.   

  

From my understanding it was a way to help sailors find their way back home somehow, not sure how seeing a random bright colored house would help you but more to them I guess. The years of wind and salt had shipped away at the color of them, making them more faded at this point.



The further I made my way the more dense the houses and buildings became, small and large in size and a lot of them now still standing like nothing had happened. Some of the buildings had collapsed in on themselves, leaving nothing but the wooden bones to remain in its place like a rotting corpse in the open for so many years. It was like everyone had gotten up and left them, leaving everything behind inside of them. The amount of rusted hooks, shambled fishing nets and other equipment left behind, no one cared to come back for any of it, my gut trying to tell me to turn back again as I pushed on.



Down by the shore line the village touched the sea, a series of old wooden docks built to withstand storms and boats alike still stood strong and tall. Smaller wooden shacks were perched on old wooden stilts, stilts driven into the stone floor below them to hold them high enough above the waves no matter how bad it got. A good lot of them were still standing, some of them had been washed away by the waves over time, only the boney wooden legs sticking up from where it once stood as a reminder. 



The docks sticking out into the salted water were like broken fingers at this point, the waves had bashed them for so long it displaced them here and there, breaking off parts of them as well and swallowing them up into the salted sea. I could only imagine the kinds of boats and people who would work on these kinds of docks back then, fisherman dragging their catch just to gut them and lay them in the sun with salt further inland where the docks tipped on an angle to point them into the sun. 



A lot of this place was still intact as if waiting for someone to return and use them once again. The thing that caught my eye the most though was high above the town's shore line and up onto the cliffside overlooking the shoreline itself. At first glance I thought it was just another house, larger than the others and painted white, but the closer I got the quicker I realized it used to be a church. 



Unlike the rest of the village the church was built differently, taller and more deliberate. Its narrow windows and steep gable gave a stark, almost defiant presence over the entire village. At one point it must have been far more striking to see sitting on that cliff side because the spire was gone, snapped off like a bone sticking out of the sky. Time had not been friendly to the church I guess and brought the spire tumbling down at one point. 



Where the spire must have landed was what held me in place as I got closer to where it would have fallen, a sight I still can’t believe even now. Drover Grave.



Beneath the jagged cliff where the old church stood the ground gave way to a huge pit the poem partly described and it was massive, way more massive than I thought it would have ever been. Just by looking at it I could easily tell you could park six, maybe seven cars across in each direction with room to spare. What made this wound in the earth so much more terrifying was how nearly perfectly symmetrical it was, a near perfect circle carved into the stone that even with modern day equipment you couldn’t make it this perfect let alone all those years ago. It looked carved out but that was impossible.   

  

This was Drover’s Grave, the very name etched into my mind just by looking at it, getting closer and closer to it with each step. I felt the same sort of fear my grandmother would give me when she spoke of this place, but now I didn’t need to hear those words anymore, the sight alone scared me to the core.



The moment I got to the edge I had to take a look, peering down into this open grave but couldn’t even see the bottom. It wasn’t just dark down there, it was like the darkness was a presence of its own, thick and heavy and seemed to swallow up the light before it could even reveal its secret. Even with the crashing waves nearby there wasn’t even a touch of water around or within the grave itself, it was bone dry. It was like Drover’s Grave was commanding the waves to never reach its edge, the waves always rushing out near it but always just out of reach from the stone it was carved into.



On the other side of Drover’s Grave where it just almost touched the cliffside there were still some remains of the church's spire, small pieces of wood painted white here. There were a few small pieces of support beams and more here and there but most of the spire was gone by now, probably down deep within Drover’s Grave at this point. The spire was probably the last thing Drover’s Grave consumed. Now that there was no one and nothing left to consume he laid there silently.







 We filled it up with tide born dead, 



Till live ones walked in there instead.







Did the people who lived here really just started offering themselves to it voluntarily? Why? What could they have possibly hoped to gain? How did something that was used to discard and dump whale bones turn into something so….ritualistic?



Now thinking about it, was there something down from the beginning, something waiting and hungering for them to offer more and just so happen to have a village form around it to feed it, or did the village simply create this beast themselves, throwing what they thought were scraps of past work only to give the beast they created a hunger for more than just bones, whispering to them to give it more until it took everyth



Fuck sorry, I forgot what I was going to say again.   

  

My head is pounding like it's about to split open. I had to drive back a few more kilometers just to make it calm down again. The rattling is slowly getting louder and louder and I can’t seem to shake it. The road in front of me just looks like a wall now that's slowly driving me back to that damn place. It's not just the rattling though, there that voice again, keeps saying the same thing over and over again. I’m going to try and finish this post the best I can, I need to tell you what happened, to warn you all not to come.   

  

While I was standing on the edge of Drover’s Grave I knew I had to get down there. I had packed plenty of rope to climb down, even took the time to learn how to attach and climb down there properly, but to my surprise there was already another way down.   

  

Closest to the shore line started what looked like a jagged stone scare case carved out of the side of the cave walls, spiraling down the entire length until the darkness consumed it, never revealing just how far down they really went. They were not small either, the stone-like steps stuck out a good 5 feet in length, plenty of space for me to make my way down with ease. They looked like the cave themselves made them instead of being hand carved or anything, but at this point that didn’t matter. I needed to get down there and see for myself what was really down there.   

  

Trust me when I say this, I was not trying to call my grandmother a liar or trying to disprove her. A part of me just had to find out what was true and what was not, for years she spoke of this place and probably didn’t know it was real herself when speaking of it. Still, a part of me had to see what was down there, maybe document it myself and show people that this place was indeed real.



That being said, I wasn’t stupid. The steps were pretty wide but one wrong step or slip and I would be falling down into a pit that I still did not know just how deep it was. I wasn’t ready to give myself up that easily and prepared myself a backup plan. To the side I pulled my backpack off, laying beside me as I grabbed some gear I had packed with me. I grabbed the rope, my hammer and a metal piton spike before getting to work looking for a crack or seem to force the piton into. It took me a bit to find a proper one but finally I did manage to find a good one near the edge of Drover’s Grave which almost felt like it was made for this as I lined up the piton and hammered it in, making sure it was snug into the stone before tying the rope into the metal ring it provided. A couple of knots later with the rope tightly tied around my waist, I was ready to go!   

  

I won't lie, stepping near the edge again knowing I was about to descend down into this deep stone flesh wound scared me a little, I felt my heart race as I took my first step, the sound of my boot tapping on to the stone floor with each slow step I took, trying to be careful as I slowly made my way down.



I left my bag up top, I didn't want to bring extra weight with me when I descended downwards. The only thing I took with me was the flashlight I had packed, a foldable knife and my phone in case I needed to take a picture or record whatever was down there. I didn’t want to risk my life for anything else as step by step I went deeper and deeper down.   

  

Whatever was down there, I was going to see it face to face.



Tap…tap…tap



I was still slow as I made my way down, each step louder than the last as the sounds of the world around me started to fade. I wasn’t even that far down and yet the world outside of Drover’s Grave seemed to fade away into the distance. The wind, the crashing waves, even the gulls who flew over top seemed to become more and more quiet as I went further and further down this cave's gullet, worst of all I was starting to be consumed by the darkness within it, the light above becoming dimmer and dimmer like the darkness was a form of fog. My flashlight could barely cut through the darkness at times, its reach becoming shooter with each step downwards as my free hand held the rope tightly like the life line it was supposed to be.



Tap…tap…tap.



My boots were the loudest thing now as the outside world went silent, only a dim light from the sky above me seemed to fade more and more even if it wasn’t that far from where I was. I was crossing some invisible threshold at this point and the only way to go was down.



Tap…tap…tap.



I clutched my flashlight tightly until my knuckles were white, shaking just a little the deeper I went down this grave of a hole. The darkness had now consumed the light above me, leaving me with just a faint memory of what the sun looked like before I entered as I slowly kept marching forward, the reach of my flashlight becoming shorter and shorter as I went. Any further down and the flashlight would be better off just turned off. I was just thankful I could see at the very least three to four steps ahead of me, giving me some space to make sure I wasn't just going to fall down this grave and fill it with new bones. 



Tap…tap…tap.



Then I started to hear it finally.   

  

At first I stopped, unsure of what I was actually hearing. I must have thought I was imagining I heard something, the silence down there was deafening to me at that point, but I heard it again, a small rattle of some sort deep down inside the hole.   

  

It was small at first, like the wind had shaken something loose, but down in Drover’s Grave there was no wind, no breeze or anything. It was cold and still, yet I could hear something down there. Just as it started it stopped for a moment, making the cave silent before starting back up again but with more rattling with it, louder each time it started again in an unusual rhythm. There was a pattern to it now as it started up then died off again, repeating over and over again with more chiming in each time it came alive.   

  

Eventually it was just small rattles anymore, there were beginning sounds coming from below like larger bones tapping against each other, set to match with the rhythm of the small rattles scattered across the floor of this grave as it kept going, never ending now into a soothing like sound.



It was all I could hear as I stood there motionless, my eyes looking down at the bottom I could not see but hear instead even as my body screamed at me to run, to get the hell out of there, yet I didn’t. The sounds, the rhythm, they were soothing to me like they were calling me to join them, wanting me to join in and become part of this new sound I had never heard of before until now. I think I smiled at one point, happy to be there for a brief moment as I stood there and took in the sounds of old below me.   

  

Man made or not, I felt comfort standing there.  

  

That comfort was shattered when I heard something new chime in, a metal like sound that tapped out of place compared to the music. It was distant above me when I looked up, darkness hiding it from my sight as I heard it get closer and closer down into Drover’s Grave. I only got a quick second to see it fly past me, a small metal spike zipping past my sight as it descended further down into the hole.   

  

It was the piton that held my rope in place and the rope followed behind it.  

  

The rope wrapped around my waist felt a small tug the moment the length of the rope ended, hanging over the edge of the stone steps as it hung over the edge and further down then what I could see. It wasn’t until the rope went tight I was pulled out of the cereal sense of calmness that my panic started to kick in, feeling it become tighter and tighter, pulling on me more and more.   

  

One rough pull made me fall on to my side, my hip being the first to move towards the edge as I tried to grip for something to keep myself in place, a struggle I had no proper way of getting out of. I dropped the flashlight at that moment as my hands went for the knife, the only thing I could think of to free myself before being pulled over the edge. 



I brought the knife to my waist, cutting into the rope as fast as I could as I was being slowly pulled to the edge, only second away from being dragged into the gaping mouth of this grave and probably fall to my death. My mind was running miles trying to focus on what I needed to do, cutting deeper and deeper into the rope until not only was I free from the rope, I felt the tip of the knife dig into my shirt, a sudden and sharp pain hitting me at the same time. The rope whipped around my waist, streaks of blood soaking into it before watching it flick over the edge and down into the hole. 



I laid there with heavy breath, grabbing the flashlight with my right hand with my left hand pressed where I had cut myself in disbelief of what had happened. I know that position was secured, I know I placed it properly and I know it could have held my weight and more if needed. How the hell did it come loose like that? Was I wrong and maybe messed it up or was it something else? 



It didn’t matter anymore, my one way of making sure I was secured was gone and now Drover’s Grave was silent once again. I got to my feet, pointing the flashlight down the middle of this gaping hole in the earth to see if I could see anything, but I couldn’t. 



 ""C’mon down b’y, we’ve been waitin’ fer ya."" An old and distant voice raised up from below, echoing across the walls of Drover’s Grave as I felt something shift around me. 



The cave felt like it was stirring awake, the wall shook slightly as the stone beneath me felt slicker than before like water was finally making its way down here finally after all these years. 



I had awakened Drover’s Grave.



I had to get out of there, I had to leave as fast as I could. 



I never moved as fast as I did while I was getting out of there, the taps of my feet slamming on the stone steps pushing me to move faster and faster. Trying to go faster was becoming harder and harder to do as each piece of stone I touched was now becoming wetter and wetter from water, making each step slippery and harder to keep myself standing as I pushed myself upwards. Drover’s Grave had a taste of me and it’s mouth was watering to eat me whole. 



The higher I got the smaller the steps started to look like they were being pulled back into the walls of this grave, trying to make me fall down into his hungry mouth, but the more I pushed on the more light started to appear above me. I threw my flashlight away, both hands hugging the wall to keep me stable, my hands scraping against the wall as I pushed myself closer and closer to the top.



The pale blue sky above was in the open now, the sound of the outside world was calling out to me louder and louder. The steps were much smaller by then, nearly a foot wide now as I kept forcing myself to keep going, my strength fading quickly, the rattling…oh god the rattling below was so loud and violent to hear, the once soothing music it made now angered by my need to run, threatening me with the sounds of the predator it really was. 



Near the end I had no choice but jump for the edge of the grave, my arms just reaching up and over the lip of the cave as I forced every ounce of strength I had left in me up and over, rolling a foot away from the mouth of the cave until my back laid on the cold wet stone below be. My breathing was wild, my body shook from the fear that was forced out of me, yet I was out. 



The rattling was now gone, but not the voice. 



""The Grave’s got yer name on it now, b’y.” The voice spoke up and out of the mouth of Drover’s Grave, holding back a low laugh as it spoke. “And what’s been called don’t stay gone for long."".



I can’t tell you how long I ran for after I caught my breath, I left everything I had there and just ran like my life depended on it. My life did depend on it, I just didn’t know it until now. The further I drove away from that place the louder it called to me, it started off quietly at first but now…now it's the only thing I can hear as I write this to you. The rattled sounds of those bones still violent in nature, singing out to me like I have no choice but to go back to it and I don’t, I don’t think I have a choice any more.







Don’t start the tune. Don’t dig. Behave. 



You can’t unhear \*The Drover’s Grave\*







It has me, it has its tune hooked into me like a hook on a line and yet I can’t do anything but fight it until I’m pulled right back in. The longer I wait the worse it gets and worst of all I know I’ll be pulled right back into that damn grave. I shouldn’t have come here, I shouldn’t have gone looking for a ghost town cursed from the start. Now the only thing I can think of is how I woke it up, I climbed down its cold corpse and awoke it from its slumber with a little taste of me. 



I know I'm a dead man but how far is its reach? How far can it lure people in now that it's awake again after all of these years? Have I condemned those near it to its call now? How long until it goes back to sleep? I have so many questions yet I am the only one to blame for this, it was my fault to seek it out like I did and brought this on to the rest of the world around it.



I’m going to drive back to where that cabin was and camp in my car for the night, maybe being closer to it will allow me to clear my mind just a little. A part of me hopes I can break this curse now placed on me but I don't think I will. 



I think I’m screwed. 



I don’t know how many of you will read this, I don’t even know if the signal on my phone will even get it out there but please don’t come looking for me. 



Don’t try to be some hero and save me from this curse.



Don’t find Drover’s Grave!",2,1752796270.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

1m2n5ti,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1m2n5ti/single_dose_espresso_grinder_upgrade_from/,Single Dose Espresso Grinder upgrade from Breville Barista Pro [$1000-1500],"
Hi all

Thanks to the community for 2 years of searching and lurking which has made my espresso much much better. Been happy with my Breville Barista Pro and as I navigate to light / medium roasts I am finding the grinder less capable and often the roasters will ask what grinder and kinda give a disclaimer to stick with some South American varieties due to the density and point me away from some of the lighter roasts / African varieties. 

Been getting beans from Toronto   🇨🇦 & surrounding area roasters like Social Coffee, Detour, Hatch & De Mello and really like some of the lighter and Ethiopian varieties. I can get close to some notes if they are roasted for espresso but if not then they aren’t that great. 

I drink usually milk based cortados or lattes and prefer mixing up trying different beans and experience different notes and stay away from dark roasts. My wife likes ice lattes and likes more traditional / stronger / bolder. So I have been single dosing the Breville and it isn’t horrible.

So been doing a ton of reading a YouTube watching and next to the quality / freshness of the roast the grinder is next and didn’t want to do a tiny step up but something that I can use with my breville until I eventually upgrade the machine where that grinder will be still useful.

I am also torn between the flat vs conical since I like the lighter / med roasts. My wife says hers taste great with the built in grinder so maybe I go flat for just myself but also saw some of the flats create particles like a conical. So I am torn. The clarity vs body of the flat vs conical is something I am interested in tasting as a side by side comparison somewhere.  

Anyways the 3 that I am thinking about are:

1) Niche Zero
- I like its relatively quiet compared to others and heard great reviews on here by owners. 
- the reviews of the Duo kinda seem not worth it where videos show particles are same as the zero 
- I don’t like the customs / import fees and the unknown but from others in my area it looks like $1200 Canadian 
- there are used ones that pop up for 950ish from time to time but I don’t want to gamble for $200 if they weren’t treated well or broken. 

2) Mazzer Philos
- looks great and has great reviews
- it’s about about $700 than the niche here in Canada at about $1750 Canadian plus tax. 

3) DF83V 
- bit cheaper and 83 mm burrs.
- some mention build quality isn’t as good but lots of ways to customize 


I kinda ruled out DF64 v2 due to posts I have been about quality and configuration.

Also ruled out timemore 64s as I have seen a lot of people who sold it to go to niche and much happier. 


Would appreciate any feedback or recommendations of grinders $1000-1500 Canadian range that will last me through my Breville and my eventual upgrade to a new machine down the road or even swap to a Breville bambino for the counter space but that’s a whole new post :) but I like the looks of Rocket Apartmento and Lelit and if I win the lottery a Linea :)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I was living in Houston, out of work and trying to get work on a drillship, 
applying daily, calling companies, submitting my resumes daily to all the 
local companies. I would head to the local Barnes & Noble in the afternoon
to relax and skim some magazines over a coffee. I knew where to head to 
get a good window seat, at a 1-chair table directly facing another 1-seater.
I'd been there enough to know where the easy tables were.  

Once day, I was at my table when two young black girls (twins?) came up 
and grabbed the adjacent table. One girl sat down, opened her books and
 began doing some homework. The other sat on the floor behind her and 
did the same. They chatted back and forth, asking each other 'what she 
got on #3' or the 'answer for question 5' or whatever. 

After the 3rd or 4th time, I interrupted table-girl, directly across from me. 
""Honey, I'm sorry to bother you. Are y'all doing schoolwork?"" She looked 
warily at me (i was a 45-ish white guy) and politely answered that they 
had a math or something test  the next day. 
I picked up my empty coffee cup and stack of magazines, and said to her-
""Why don't y'all take both tables. All I'm doing is reading car magazines.""
She turned and said to her sister, ""come on up, he giving us the table.""

They both thanked me, but I waved them off. ""I'm just reading magazines.
Y'all need the table more than me."" I'll just sit somewhere else. As floor-girl 
moved into the table, I said ""Good luck on your test."" and walked away. 
They both said ""Thank you, sir"". I hope they did well on their tests.",67,1752795779.0,randomactsofkindness,6,0.99,False

I've loved having espresso and lattes in the morning when I wake up but I've always wished that we had a normal espresso machine so I can get a better quality drink. I like getting espresso from my local shop and our home machine just never has the same flavor as the shop. It has always tasted watered down or acidic to me, even with the same beans. Now that I'm moving out I thought it would be a great time to get my own setup so I can continue my morning coffee ritual and hopefully get a better espresso at home. I also want to sometimes make sugary drinks for my partner but I'm not too worried about that since really any shot of espresso will do for those.

I am working at Walmart and putting myself through college so my budget is VERY tight. I've sold a couple things I won't have space for when I move like guitars and such. $400 is basically as high as I can go but I'm shooting for something lower if possible. I do know and fully understand that at this budget I will be making many concessions with the quality of my espresso. I'm just hoping to make something that is a bit better than what I can make now. I've copied this table from the posting guide and filled it out

||
||
|Location|Greenville SC|
|Preferred drink types|Espresso and lattes. I'd also like to make sugary drinks for my partner though too|
|Drink frequency|Every morning and sometimes several in a row for guests|
|Space|EXTREMELY limited countertop space. Maybe the size of 3 small stove tops.|
|Experience level|Brand new to espresso making|
|Manual or electric|hand grinder for sure to save space and money. Id like to get an electric espresso machine though, I don't like the manual ones very much.|

Here are the items I currently have in my cart and my explanation for picking each. 

Espresso Machine: CASABREWS CM5418 

From what I've seen online this might be one of the few espresso machines I can afford that still preforms decently. I would look into used machines but I am somewhat distrustful of used kitchen appliances since I don't believe enough people do the preventative maintenance required of most of them, let alone regular cleaning(please for the love of god clean your dishwasher filter). 

Grinder: KINGridner P2

This is probably the item on my list I have gone back and forth on the most. I know I will need a hand grinder to both save money and countertop space but finding one that works well and that doesn't make my wallet cry has been hard. I landed on this one because my friend got one and said he has been using it to make espresso to much success. But, lots of posts online go back and forth on if this is a grinder capable of making fine enough grounds for espresso. I'd be fine for springing for something like the K1 since it's not too much more but at my budget every little bit matters. So if its not completely necessary I'm fine dealing with the cheaper quality of the P2. I plan of upgrading later anyway when I have maybe another $150 to just drop on a good hand grinder.

Portafilter: CAPFEI 51mm Bottomless Portafilter

Many people online I've seen talk about the Casabrews cm5418 have said the first thing you should do is buy a new portafilter. This is one of the few I could find that guarantees fits into the cm5418 and I plan on getting a different basket anyway. I asked normcore support if their portafilter would fit but they said they only guarantee it to fit in certain models of espresso machine. I haven't seen much about CAPFEI or if they are reliable though

Basket: Normcore 51mm High Extraction Filter Basket, 16-18g

I tried to look at as many normcore things as I could since they seem to have a consistent quality and good price. I don't know if this will fit in my portafilter but I don't know any reason it wouldn't since it's still 51mm. I also wanted something that could fit 18g of grounds since I plan on making 40g of espresso for each latte. I know that's not exactly 1:2 but I'm hoping deviating from that won't cause too much trouble. Also it comes with a puck screen and that's savings baby.

Distribution method: Normcore 51mm 2-in-1 Magnetic Dosing Cup

I watched WAY too many videos breaking down the different distribution methods of espresso grounds and even found myself reading some papers and graphs. From what I've seen using a blind shaker like this and then just knocking the side of the portafilter to even things out should work pretty well for me. I have thought about adding one of those spinning distributors to my list but I have chosen to leave out the WDT entirely.  

Tamper: Normcore 51mm Coffee Tamper V4.1

The main thing I was worried about with tamping is making sure it's level. I do not trust myself to just tamp it level so I wanted one that self leveled, the click when I hit a certain pressure is just a cool bonus to me. Again I am still trying to go with normcore since that's what I trusted from people recommending brands online.

Scale: Coffee Scale with Timer, Kitchen, Digital, Rechargeable, Glass Mirror Design, for Pour-Over Barista, 0.3-3000g/0.1g

It is literally just one of the cheapest scales with a timer on it I could find on amazon. It seems accurate enough but I'm not married to this one at all. 

Milk Frothing Pitcher: CASABREWS CASMP350 Milk Frothing Pitcher

It seemed like most pitchers were around $10 on amazon so I thought why not just get one that's the same brand as the machine? I don't think this actually matters too much.

Atomizer: Fusupak Perfume Atomizer

Just a cute bottle to spray my grounds. I see it in tiktoks a lot when they make espresso. I know it reduces static but I don't know if I actually need to spray the beans or if any couple drops of water would work just as well. 

All together it adds up to about $336. The things I'm most concerned about is anything I might be buying that I don't really need and if my grinder is truly good enough for espresso. I have a roaster in my area I trust to get good beans and I'll be mostly getting a dark roast so I think that should help me have an easier time dialing in my setup. I'm just looking for some criticism about what I've chosen and if there might be anything I'm missing or don't know about because of inexperience. Thanks guys!",1,1752795730.0,espresso,12,1.0,False

It wasn’t some dramatic thing. No yelling, no slammed doors, no big blow-up. I just came downstairs that morning expecting… something. A card, maybe. A “Happy Birthday!” yelled while he sipped his coffee. Instead, he asked me if I could mow the lawn before it got too hot.

I did it. Quietly. Told myself maybe he had something planned for later. Spoiler: he didn’t.

That night we ate leftovers. He watched a game on the couch. Around 9:30, I finally just said, “Hey, I’m gonna go to bed.” He nodded without looking up.

I cried in the bathroom. Not loud. Just sat there on the cold tile because the fan drowned out the sound.

The next day, he remembered. He came into my room with this panicked look on his face and said, “I’m so sorry, buddy. I don’t know what happened.” He offered to take me out for a “belated birthday lunch.” I told him it was fine. That I hadn’t even noticed.

That was a lie.

I noticed. I noticed a lot of things that year. Like how tired he looked all the time. How he kept forgetting simple things, like the dog’s food, the laundry in the washer, my school play. How he stopped shaving on weekends and started going to bed with the TV still on.

My mom had died two years earlier, and at the time I thought I was the only one still falling apart. But looking back, I think maybe he was too. Quietly. In his own way.

He never forgot again. Every year after that, even when I moved out, he’d text me at 6:42 AM - the time I was born - with something dumb like “You’re old now” or “Happy womb escape day.”

He died last summer. Heart failure. I found a draft email on his computer that just said, “Don’t forget 6:42.”

Anyway. I never told him how much that one missed birthday hurt. And I never will.

Tips?","Started at 215 March 2024, and by October 2024 I reached 180lbs. I did this entirely through diet only, although I did some at-home YouTube Pilates for core strength for a few weeks (but it didn’t stick, working out never does for me). I hike every weekend in the summer, I’d do it more often if not for my 9-5. I maintained at 180 through winter in order to fit into my wedding dress for my wedding this past spring. I couldn’t afford to buy a new dress if I lost too much weight. 


Now I’m 4 months post wedding, and post honeymoon eating whatever I want bliss. Miraculously, though I haven’t been tracking for months now, and though I feel I have indulged, I’ve stayed around 180lbs, fluctuating between 182 and 179. 

I’m ready to get back in the saddle and get down to my goal weight of 140, but I’m struggling with my new deficit to get there. I use MFP and it’s suggesting around 1,420 a day, and I can’t even make it that low. I’ve been doing around 1500-1600/day and while I’m sure I’ll see progress, I know it’s going to crawl, and despite this being a bit more than the recommended amount, I’m SO hungry! I’m having daily headaches, I’m always tired, my eyes are sunken, and my mood is terrible. 

As far as my diet goes: I eat around 60-90 grams of protein a day, fiber with every meal, and I drink 32-64oz of water every day. No specific diet, I eat all foods. I drink one cup of coffee with a splash of milk (no sugar) in the morning, and if I’m really tired I’ll have some green tea or black tea in the afternoon at work (no honey, no sugar, no milk). Sometimes a celcius. I do have a major sweet tooth, to satisfy this I try and save room for a fruit juice popsicle or a scoop of ice cream, or if I can’t afford the calories I’ll have a Coke Zero to try and settle my craving.  

How are you adjusting to lower intakes as you loose? I know exercise is one way to get some more calories in, and I do about 20,000 steps on the weekends through hiking, but don’t you just get hungrier? Doesn’t the hunger from the exercise kind of equal out anyway? That’s what I find after a day of hiking, the extra 100 or so calories it affords me doesn’t do much for satiating my very hungry and tired body.

What makes it even more complicated? He lives in the same house as me — and he’s my brother’s best friend.

We live in Canada. A few years ago, he moved in with us because our house is close to his work, and my family offered him a place to stay to make things easier. At first, he was just “my brother’s friend,” but over time, we started talking more. We connected in ways I never expected. When I was 15 and he was 18, we slowly fell for each other. And before anyone comes for us — our relationship has always been legal where we live, and nothing ever crossed any lines.

Still, we knew what this would look like to everyone else. So we kept it a secret. Only my four closest friends and his one best friend know.

Living under the same roof and being in love, but having to pretend we’re just roommates, is one of the hardest things I’ve ever done.

But he makes it worth it. He works full-time, but still finds little ways to show he cares — checking on me after school, bringing me coffee before a big test, making sure I’m safe, happy, and respected. He’s patient. Gentle. He’s never pressured me into anything. In fact, he’s the one always making sure we’re careful, and that I feel comfortable. That’s what made me fall so hard for him.

We made a promise: once I turn 18, we’ll tell our families everything. We’ll finally be honest. Because we’re not ashamed — just cautious. We didn’t plan for this to happen, but it did. And it’s real.

I know people think teenagers can’t understand love, but what we have is full of respect, communication, patience, and support. It might be complicated, but it’s real.

Cork coasters have become a staple in homes and offices,offering a natural,sustainable and effective way to protect surfaces from water rings and heat damage. As we move into 2025, the market is filled with numerous options, each boasting different qualities and benefits. This guide aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the best cork for coasters, helping you make an informed decision based on your needs and preferences.We’ll delve into the key features, core benefits, and how different options stack up against each othre, ensuring you find the perfect cork coasters for your space.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of cork coasters are heavily influenced by several key features. These include the density of the cork, the thickness of the coaster, the presence of any coatings, and the manufacturing process. Understanding these elements will help you assess the durability, absorbency, and overall suitability of different cork coaster sets for your specific needs.

**Cork Density:** Refers to the mass per unit volume of the cork material. Higher density cork generally offers better insulation and water resistance, making it ideal for coasters that will be frequently exposed to moisture and heat. A denser cork will also be more durable and less likely to crumble or warp over time. Specific density measurements aren’t readily available for all coasters, but visually inspecting the cork and noting how tightly packed the granules are can offer a good indication.

Generally, look for cork that appears solid and feels heavier for its size. This indicates a denser material that will provide better protection for your surfaces. Lower density cork tends to be more porous and may absorb liquids more readily, possibly leading to staining or disintegration over time. The ideal density for cork coasters usually falls within a range that provides a good balance between absorbency and durability.

**Coaster Thickness:** Directly impacts the coaster's ability to insulate and absorb liquids. Thicker coasters provide a greater barrier between hot or cold beverages and the underlying surface, preventing heat transfer and condensation damage. They also offer more substantial spill protection, capable of absorbing larger amounts of liquid before it overflows onto the table.

Choosing the appropriate thickness depends on your typical usage. A minimum thickness of approximately 1/4 inch (6mm) is generally recommended for adequate heat and moisture protection. Though, for added assurance, especially with frequent use or larger drinks, consider coasters that are closer to 1/3 inch (8mm) or thicker.While thicker coasters offer enhanced protection, they can also be slightly less subtle in appearance, so consider the aesthetic impact alongside the functional benefits.

**Surface Coating (If Applicable):** Some cork coasters come with a surface coating designed to enhance their durability, water resistance, or aesthetic appeal. Common coatings include varnish, sealant, or a thin layer of plastic laminate. These coatings can provide an extra layer of protection against spills and stains, making the coasters easier to clean.

Though, it’s critically important to consider the type of coating used and its potential impact on the coaster's overall performance. For example, a thick layer of varnish may make the coaster less absorbent, which could defeat the purpose of using cork in the first place.Some coatings may also release harmful chemicals, especially when exposed to high temperatures. When selecting cork coasters with a coating, opt for options that use food-safe, non-toxic materials and that do not compromise the natural absorbency and breathability of the cork.

**Manufacturing Process:** Considerably influences the quality and consistency of the finished product.Well-manufactured cork coasters will have smooth edges, a uniform thickness, and a consistent cork density throughout. Poorly manufactured coasters may have rough edges,uneven surfaces,or weak spots that are prone to cracking or crumbling.

The process of bonding the cork granules together also plays a critical role. Coasters made with a high-quality adhesive will be more durable and less likely to fall apart over time.Look for coasters that are made using a compression molding process, which typically results in a denser and more uniform product. Avoid coasters that appear cheaply made or that have visible gaps or imperfections in the cork.

## Core Benefits

cork coasters offer several distinct advantages over other types of coasters. Their natural absorbency, heat resistance, and eco-friendly qualities make them a popular choice for protecting surfaces from spills and damage. Beyond the functional aspects, cork coasters also add a touch of natural elegance to any setting.**Extraordinary Absorbency:** Cork is naturally porous, allowing it to absorb liquids quickly and efficiently. This is particularly beneficial for preventing water rings and condensation from damaging furniture.Unlike plastic or metal coasters that may allow condensation to pool on the surface, cork coasters wick away moisture, keeping your tables dry and protected.

This absorbency also reduces the risk of drinks sticking to the coaster and potentially spilling when lifted. The natural structure of cork allows it to retain a meaningful amount of liquid without becoming saturated, making it an ideal material for coasters used with a variety of beverages, from iced drinks to hot coffees. Users report a significant reduction in water rings and spills compared to using non-absorbent coaster materials.

**Effective Heat Resistance:** Cork's unique cellular structure provides excellent insulation properties, protecting surfaces from heat damage. This makes cork coasters suitable for use with hot beverages such as coffee, tea, and hot chocolate, preventing heat from transferring to the table or countertop and causing discoloration or warping.

The natural heat resistance of cork also makes it a safer option compared to materials like glass or metal, which can become hot to the touch and potentially burn. When used with hot drinks, cork coasters remain relatively cool, providing a cozy and safe surface for handling. The insulating properties of cork help maintain the temperature of your beverage for longer, keeping your drink warmer while protecting your surfaces.

**Sustainable and Eco-Friendly:** Cork is a renewable resource harvested from the bark of cork oak trees without harming the tree itself. This makes cork coasters an environmentally friendly alternative to coasters made from plastic, metal, or other non-renewable materials. The cork harvesting process actually benefits the cork oak forests by promoting their growth and biodiversity.

By choosing cork coasters, you are supporting sustainable forestry practices and reducing your environmental impact. cork is also biodegradable, meaning that it will decompose naturally at the end of its lifespan, unlike plastic which can persist in the environment for hundreds of years. Many manufacturers also use eco-friendly adhesives and finishes in the production of cork coasters, further enhancing their sustainability.

**Lightweight and durable:** despite their absorbent and heat-resistant properties, cork coasters are incredibly lightweight, making them easy to handle and store. They are also surprisingly durable, able to withstand daily use without easily breaking or cracking.the natural elasticity of cork allows it to flex and absorb impact, making it less prone to damage than rigid materials like ceramic or glass. This durability also makes cork coasters a cost-effective choice in the long run, as they are less likely to need frequent replacement. The lightweight nature of cork also makes it easier to transport and store coasters, allowing you to keep them readily available wherever you need them.

## FAQs Section

Selecting the right cork coasters can sometimes raise questions, especially concerning their durability, cleaning, and specific applications. Here are answers to some frequently asked questions:

**How do I clean cork coasters?**
Cleaning cork coasters is generally simple. For light stains or spills,wipe the coaster with a damp cloth. For more stubborn stains, you can use a mild soap and water solution. Avoid harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the cork.

After cleaning, allow the coaster to air dry completely before storing it. To prevent staining, it’s best to clean spills as soon as they occur. Periodic deep cleaning can definitely help maintain the appearance of your coasters and extend their lifespan. Some users also recommend using a baking soda paste to remove stubborn stains, but always test it on a small, inconspicuous area first.

**Are cork coasters suitable for outdoor use?**
Cork coasters can be used outdoors, but their lifespan may be shorter due to exposure to the elements. Prolonged exposure to sunlight, rain, and humidity can cause the cork to fade, warp, or become brittle.

If you plan to use cork coasters outdoors, consider choosing coasters with a sealant or coating that provides added protection against the elements. Store the coasters indoors when not in use to prolong their lifespan.Using heavier, more dense cork material can also extend their outdoor usability.

**Do cork coasters leave residue on furniture?**
High-quality cork coasters typically do not leave residue on furniture. Though,lower-quality coasters made with inferior materials or adhesives may shed small particles of cork over time.

To minimize the risk of residue, choose coasters made from high-density cork and that have a smooth, sealed surface. Regularly clean your coasters to remove any loose particles that may accumulate. Some manufacturers also offer coasters with a backing made of felt or other soft material to prevent scratching and residue.

>Once used to hold paint, mop water or haul home a fresh catch of fish, buckets are increasingly being used for something else entirely. Equipped with straws, the vessels, for some, are replacing the standard to-go cups used for iced coffee and lattes. And they are racking up views on TikTok along the way.

>“I drove an hour to a shop because I was like, ‘This is going to be trendy,’” said Tiffany Guckin, 37, a director of operations at a research firm and a food content creator based in Guilford, Conn. “I think millennial moms in particular are looking for something to jazz up their days.”

>The only downside? Cup holders. “It does fit in your glove compartment, if you open it,” she added.

>Ms. Guckin is among a growing number of coffee lovers who have decided that a simple 12-ounce drink will not cut it anymore. Some have repurposed Weck jars or old pasta sauce containers. But a handful of cafes are leaning into the absurdity by serving iced coffees and lattes in 34-ounce buckets, often with handles. The trend is drawing a crowd.

>Dulce Vida, a Mexican-inspired cafe in Tulsa, Okla., debuted “La Cubeta,” its 34-ounce version of a latte, last month after the trend gained traction on social media. Tiffany Rodriguez, the cafe’s founder, quickly embraced it as a way to differentiate from corporate giants like Starbucks and Dunkin’.

>She recalled a woman from New Hampshire calling to ask whether they’d still have buckets available that weekend, when she was planning to drive down. Ms. Shilosky, who currently employs a team of three, said she expected to “hire very, very shortly” to keep pace with demand.

>For smaller businesses, it’s a low-lift way to tap into something viral. In Imperial, Mo., Brittany and Chris Stier run a coffee cart, Noctua Coffee, that offers oversize lattes, but they did not have to introduce new flavors or add any trimmings in order to summon crowds to their stand at their local farmers market.

>The larger size also encourages splitting a drink with a friend, Ms. Stier said. “We really believe in community and connection and so if this is something that connects two people to share a coffee over, like, we want to keep that on our menu,” she added.

>Andrea Hernández, a cultural commentator and the writer of Snaxshot, a newsletter on food trends, said that the trend played well on social media but that it also reflected a broader shift in attitudes toward caffeine.

>**“We’re kind of experiencing that sort of backlash from what we were trying to do, like, less caffeine, more mindfulness, more meditation, less palpitations,”** Ms. Hernández said. She noted that in the 2010s, adaptogenic coffee and ashwagandha blends aimed to slow people down. In her opinion, consumers have become skeptical of wellness hype and are leaning hard in the opposite direction.

>Still, for some, it’s more about the novelty than the buzz.

>Aileen Gonzalez, 24, an accountant based in Placentia, Calif., recently drove through an hour of traffic with her sister and nephew to reach a woman’s house in West Covina after spotting her bucket coffee business on Instagram.

>“It’s just to do something new, something that we haven’t seen,” she said, adding that the aesthetic of a big coffee bucket, more than the flavor, was what drew her in.

Intradermal spore inoculation, dosages escalating over 14-day cycles. Monitored CNS activity for synaptic disruptions, behavioral anomalies, cytokine responses.

Results were inconclusive- until phase three. Neural tissue began to hypertrophy, synapses firing erratically. Subjects exhibited compulsive vocalizations, repetitive motions-self-mutilation in two cases, confirmed via endoscopy. Neuroinflammation evident in MRI scans.

The Bloom isn’t just biological- it’s bioempathic. It infiltrates emotional centers

Its strange thinking back on the subjects. Subject 07... Subject 07 was different.  She- yes, she- had eyes that held something human, like she understood what was happening. I named her guppy. I spent hours just watching her- tracking her behavior, noting how she resisted the bloom longer than the others. She loved playing in the small Coalition ordained water dish, watching the water ripple and splash from her fingertips. 

She’d reach through the cage bars with trembling hands, she wanted to touch something real. One afternoon. Her fingers- long, trembling- slid through the cold metal. I remember the exact moment her palm brushed mine, skin against skin, a touch so small…Her eyes locked onto mine- wide, pleading, something ancient and raw in that gaze. It wasn’t just fear or pain. It was connection. A wordless conversation- one I wasn’t supposed to hear. No. One I didn't want to hear.

I swear the Bloom was listening too. Her breath caught, her chest rising in a shuddering rhythm that matched the pulses I’d been tracking in her blood. The infection wasn’t just physical, it was emotional. For a moment, the cage dissolved. I felt her confusion, her terror, but also a strange calm- like surrender. And maybe, just maybe, trust. Then the Bloom took her. Petals unfurling grotesquely from her temples, swallowing that last flicker of her resistance.

She reached out for something- maybe salvation, maybe an end. And for a fleeting second... I reached back. Curling and swelling, thickening like living tissue. The Bloom was no longer just inside her- it was becoming her. Her eyes glazed over, once sharp and human, now glossy and unseeing.

She stopped reaching.

She stopped fighting.

I should have done more. I should have saved her.

But I was powerless.

And now she’s gone.

Not dead. Not alive. 

I failed her.

I left her behind in that cage.

I don’t know if I can forgive myself.

I see it in her eyes, the girl. The same slow surrender.

WREN: Wren, A. – Zone 9-E, E3 base. Hey. Uh, sorry to ping you directly. Just needed to check protocol for voluntary rotation withdrawal.

MASON: Withdrawal? You’re four weeks into a sixteen-week placement. There a medical issue?

WREN: No—nothing like that. Just… I’ve logged all my data collection points. Most of the test group has migrated east past the creek. Cam footage is getting sparse. I figured I could transfer the rest of the logs remotely.

MASON: You don’t get to make that call, Wren. That’s a Command-level reassignment.

WREN: I’m just—ready to rotate out.



MASON:

Mm. Doesn’t really work like that. Interns finish on-site unless there’s a medical or mechanical failout. You filed anything?

WREN: No, I didn’t. I was hoping… just thought it would make sense..

MASON:

You don’t decide what makes sense, Wren.

You’re on contract. Rotation ends when Command says it ends.



WREN:

Right. I just figured—look, maybe I jumped the gun. Sorry.

Forget it. I’ll log a report through Khoury like normal—just forget I asked.

Got reassigned. Heading out to Zone 9-E to work with some field intern named Wren. Officially, I’m “support”—which mostly means I’m supposed to watch her. Can’t exactly tell her that.

I’m not here to make friends. That’s not the job. But maybe I’ll keep my mouth shut and do it right.

Higher clearance comes with this assignment. Finally some real access. Maybe I’ll figure out what this whole operation is really about.

I’ll miss the little comforts—hot showers, solid food, quiet nights without bugs crawling on me. But this is where I’m supposed to be.

Spent most of the day deploying the cameras and audio recorders around the base perimeter. Six total. Standard grid coverage—north, south, and west tree lines, with the eastern ridge getting doubled up.

The soil out here’s soft- takes the tripod legs like it’s hungry for them. Had to brace three of the cams with root bundles and spare rebar. Doesn’t help that everything’s damp. Even the air feels heavy.

Wren is... not what I expected. She’s younger than the file made her out to be. Maybe early twenties. Wide eyes, too tired to be naïve but still searching, as if she’s hoping the trees will talk back. She moves like someone who hasn’t rested in weeks—shaky hands when she’s typing, foot tapping nonstop, jaw clenched even when she’s smiling. But she keeps working. Doesn’t stop. I feel like she’s afraid something will catch up if she lets herself be still.

She offered me coffee earlier. Instant, bitter as hell, but the gesture landed. She didn’t say much- just handed me the cup as a peace treaty. That kind of thing makes it harder to keep the wall up. I’m supposed to observe, not engage. But she’s trying. That counts for something.

Anyway, cameras are all online. Feed’s clean- no static, no interference. Audio mics are running cold but should warm up overnight. Wren’s still out past the southern grid, collecting samples along the creekbed. She radioed in around 1600 to say she found something ""off"" in the moss-  didn’t elaborate. I logged it.

I’ll review the footage after dark and check in with Corporate before lights out.

1m2mqvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1m2mqvr/review_a_comprehensive_sampling_of_arcana/,Review: A Comprehensive Sampling of Arcana Wildcraft,"Hello friends, I'm back today with a review of Arcana Wildcraft, which has popped up many times on my Weird Perfume journey. From this long-ass list you can probably tell that I've sampled, ordered, sampled, ordered again, and hunted the Sunday destash postings to pull this together over a quite a few months timeframe.

There are hits, misses, a great bread, and even an appearance of a rogue beef jerky note. I've tried to organize my reviews by ""collection"" but I've just ordered and sampled willy-nilly as per usual.

Let's get into it:

ARCANA CLASSICS:

**Yggdrasil:** Oooh this is a dark, witch-of-the woods type fragrance. It’s only slightly incense-y and smoky, and even before reading the notes I can really pick out the frankincense and pine. This really smells like everything it promises to be. I appreciate that they went light on the incense which I think can sometimes take over. I was quite enamored of this one but my husband says “Christmas Tree Shop” soooo some people are a bit harder to impress I guess. Do I need another pine perfume? No. But do I want it? Yes.  ***Notes:*** *Sacred incense, dark woods, Timbersilk, citrusy frankincense tears, wild-harvested fir branches, black spruce, smoky amber, and heartwood cedar* 8/10

JAGUAR HEART:

**Oxomoco**: Really wanted to love this one but there’s something weird here that had me running to the notes to figure out. It smells distinctly wooly to me, and not in a fun way. It smells *textured*. I think there’s something funky happening in the way my brain is interpreting the incense and frankincense smoke. Almost rubbery?  It’s…a lot. And it really projects too. I was hoping for more coconut and coconut milk but alas, this sort of smells like a new Chuck Taylor.  ***Notes***: *Sumptuous curls of incense with coconut husks, our handmade frankincense smoke enfleurage, creamy musk, woody amber, and coconut milk* 4/10

HEL’S BELLES:

**Frigga**: Vanilla, but not too sweet and something fuzzy that makes me want to sneeze. I cross-referenced the notes for this with the only other fragrance that has made me involuntarily sneeze (**Wandering Star** by Stone & wit) and YUP that’s cashmere! Probably going to avoid cashmere notes in the future. Aside from the cashmere and vanilla, there’s not much going on here. I’ve read quite a few glowing reviews of this one so I’m not sure what I’m missing but this isn’t for me.  ***Notes***: *Black tonka bean, raw cashmere wool, French bakery vanilla, soft warm skin, confectionery sugar, and sweet almond.* 3.5/10

**Gullveig:** Coffee and amber makes a sweet, nostalgic coffee syrup. This doesn’t smell so much like a latte as it smells like standing in front of the wall of self-serve single-origin coffee beans at your local third wave coffee shop. I kind of love it but it’s A Lot, maybe even Too Much for me. Is there leather in here? \[Nope!\] This goes through a bitter phase, but lands in a slightly more manageable land of warm coffee-vanilla which is a delight to behold. I’m going to keep testing this one out before I put it on the FS shortlist though since the beginning is especially overpowering for me. ***Notes***: *Opening with a thunderbolt of coffee amber (resins of labdanum and benzoin with Arabica coffee and Madagascan vanilla), Gullveig leads you to a heart of cold ice cream and a base of warm lambswool and soft dry spices. A coffee-laced amber with gourmand notes.* 7/10

**Sigyn**: I had a super negative reaction to this when I first tested on skin. Something incredibly strong and sweet, medicinal - cherry Nyquil? Ring pops? My husband says “a fruity sugary plant thing.” Not helpful! Once I look at the notes I can pick out the guava which has been turned up to 11, as well as that honey mead note that didn’t quite work for me in Gjallerhorn. This became quite gross to me after a few minutes and I ended up scrubbing, but the scent was so powerful it lingered for many hours later at a lower intensity. I will make a mental note to stay away from meade notes in the future! ***Notes:*** *Celebratory mead with honeycomb, sugared vanilla, guava, nectarines, vegan beeswax accord, and yellow daisy pollen. A vanilla and honey laced fruit scent. Limited edition.* 3/10

**Jarnsaxa:** Oh well THIS is a musky coconut. This is a savory, leathery (almost plasticky?) coconut that means business. I didn’t like this at all at first, but like **Asgard**, I warmed up to it and now I think it’s a pretty good approximation of a realistic coconut. It’s a lot better on the skin than in the bottle. I am becoming quite smitten with coconut scents. After a few hours it's lovely, but the initial musky phase is a bit much for me. This also got a thumbs down from my husband. ***Notes:*** *An opening of spicy black pepper and fermented coconut leads to a savage heart of barbarian musk, dry woods, rich Bourbon vanilla, warm mohair, and ancient, leather-bound books.* 7/10

ANTEDELUVIAN:

**This is Not Canada**: I picked this up in a destash and this is a delicious injection of pine to the brain. At first it’s really quite sharp, like pure spruce oil, and I like that though I think it might be too much for someone who is not a Pinehead. After a minute it eases into a sort of golden sweetness that almost smells like honey \[notes say a golden amber.\] I immediately went to FS this and surprise, this has been discontinued. Sad!!! If you have this in an EDP and you want to send it to a good home HMU. ***Notes:*** *Sweet jammy Canadian fir absolute and wildcrafted Canadian Black Spruce, suffused by three golden ambers.* 8.5/10

**Filthy Viking**: They should call this CLEAN Viking because that jawn is minty fresh! The pine is there, but oh my gosh is this mentholated! The more I sniffed the more I realized I’ve smelled this before - and it’s my Burt’s Bees chapstick. It gets a little more herbal and interesting as it dries down but the menthol punch to the nose is something else. I talked myself out of full-sizing this because do I really want to smell like mint chapstick all day? Something about it really tickles my brain though. ***Notes***: *bracing Norwegian juniper, frigid Icelandic mint, and the hardy wood of a longship* 8/10

**Bonfires at Dusk:** I’m getting the smoke note, but I’m also getting some herbs \[lavender\] and the combo makes this smell a little like…carpet? Like something musty? I saw this described somewhere as “lavender ointment left in the fire” and I have to agree there’s a cool, medicinal quality to the lavender now that I know it’s there.  I can’t get over this weird carpet association! It just…smells like the carpet in a smoker’s house.  **Notes**: *Woodsmoke, sweet beeswax, Oregon lavender, sandalwood, charred juniper, and the scent of swiftly appearing stars.* 4/10

RAGNAROK:

**Asgard**: This is just straight coconut and fig. I initially found it a bit stodgy and odd to me; the coconut was loud, the fig was loud and I didn't think they worked together at all. However, I bought this as a 5ml bottle on the destashes so I relentlessly kept sampling and…now I kind of like it? It's more coconut forward than fig at first, but the fig comes up from below the coconut to round things out, especially during the dry down. This turns into a very musky, round scent, and I see myself reaching for this in cooler weather  ***Notes***:  *An opening of coconut husks and green fig leaves dries down into the scent of the darkness.* 7/10

**Fenris (Freebie)**: I’m getting vanilla and amber, and something spicy which gives it an almost medicinal quality at first. As it dries down there’s something fuzzy happening, but it’s not quite as irritating as the cashmere accord in Frigga \[notes say maybe it’s the “silken lupine fur accord”\]. This goes on light and stays light throughout the several hours of wear time, with a bit of waxiness towards the end. Not bad, but not super memorable for me.  I can’t find this scent anywhere on the website but thankfully I was able to pull notes from a past IMAM review (this sub is the gift that keeps giving!)  ***Notes***: *A classic amber accord (labdanum resin, benzoin resin, and sweet, rich Mexican vanilla) is enhanced with molten gold, carnal notes, mild cardamom, and a silken lupine fur accord* 5/10

**Gjallarhorn**: Honey and mint? It’s a warm, boozy honey without any of the problematic powder that I usually find in strong honey fragrances. \[checks notes\] No mint, so I must be picking up on the pine. I know this is supposed to be mead, but it smells almost exactly like the honey-flavored Nyquil in my bathroom cabinet (not the cherry flavor!) Now that I’ve made the honey Nyquil association, that’s really all I can smell. I actually don’t hate it, but I’m not sure I want to constantly smell Nyquil.  ***Notes***: *Barrel-aged honey meade, golden musk, towering pine trees, vegan beeswax, marine ambergris, blonde woods, and vanilla bean*. 6/10

**Hlin:** If you know me, you know I’m a slut for a bread note, and approaching this one with much anticipation. While wet this is both sweet and weirdly sour, and while I think a bread note SHOULD have a bit of sourness, but this didn’t seem like a yeast-based sourness and generally I wasn’t getting much bread at all. It was just kind of…weird.  However, two things happened that absolutely changed my mind: 1) the day after testing out Hlin I was re-wearing the same turtleneck and during the course of the morning was slowly overcome with a beautifully sweet, balanced, rich fragrance. It took me a while, but eventually I realized that Hlin had transferred to my clothing from the previous day and it smelled amazing…I was transformed into an oven of warmth and comfort with a pot of melted butter on the stove. 2) On another wear test I asked my husband to smell my wrist, but he said “I can already smell you” from 5 feet away, meaning a tiny dab at the wrists was putting up an insane scent bubble. I insisted he smell my wrist anyway and he said “smells better from far away. Like bread.”  So there you have it folks - Hlin is good, but even better with time and distance. When I stick my nose to my wrist, it’s not great, but when I take a step back it’s this gorgeous bubble of buttery bready goodness. ***Notes***: *biscuits, fresh and warm from the oven, then slathered in churned butter.* 9/10

**Jörmungandr:** I’m gonna be real with y’all, this smelled like beef jerky. Like straight up salty, dry, meaty beef jerky. I ran to the notes to try to figure this out and I think the leather, salt water, and smoky birch tar are giving me beef jerky in a big way. On the dry down this became more traditionally marine, but still also beef jerky. Probably the birch tar. Hard pass.  ***Notes***: *Fjord water, salty Cetalox, rich brown leather, wild-harvested seaweed, frozen Neroli blossoms, and smoky birch tar*. 2.5/10

PLANET EARTH

**Vines Reclaim the World**: On paper this is everything I want in a fragrance. On my skin..this is men’s shower gel. Specifically, a rainforest-themed shower gel. Dr. Squatch? I’m sorry!!! ***Notes***: *An opening of green, humid vines, aromatic herbs, and wool absolute leads to a heart of petrichor, violet leaf, raw silk, soft musks, our hand-distilled rosemary, bright galbanum, moss, grass, and salt* 4/10

**Dolphin Surge:** This is an odd one. At first it smells almost like…leather? Of course there are no leather notes to speak of, but something about the salt and the coastal moss and perhaps the “oceanic Ambroxan” is making me think of leather. On the dry down it corrects itself though into a musky sweetness with that lovely salty note. I already have Sugar Haze by Cardinal Scents and Judith by Treading Water, and I like those a bit more for a musky sexy salty amber scent, but this is perfectly acceptable. This is also pretty weak on my skin and short-lived, so I can’t give it full marks. ***Notes:*** *Mexican vanilla, sea salt, golden sand, pink lollipops, oceanic Ambroxan, vanilla ice cream, and coastal moss.* 7/10

**Butterfly Rabble:** As a certified citrus hater, this was way outside my comfort zone but I am impressed and reconsidering my citrus-hating ways! It opens with a delicious candied lemon peel with amazing projection. On my skin it dries down to a silky, sugared lemon with just a hint of warmth - like a lemon shortbread cookie. This kind of airy, sugary, lemon gourmand reminds me of Chelsea Morning by Lush without all of the weird cloying sour butterscotch (iykyk). I don’t think I’ve encountered such a fun, lemony scent that doesn’t either fade or turn into a cleaning product on my skin. I really enjoyed this one and might have to upsize as well. ***Notes:*** *Delicious cupcakes infused with our hand-extracted lemon essence, vanilla oleoresin, silken wings, lemon frosting accord, candy floss, and soft bergamot.* 8.5/10

So what can we glean from this sprawling exploration of Arcana Wildcraft? Well, they clearly have vision and take risks, and have created some little triumphs as well as some things that are straight up gross. I respect this kind of unevenness in a sampling because it’s purely based on my particular tastes and not because the perfume house is lacking in quality or imagination. There’s nothing worse than sampling a bunch of different things from a house and realizing every single one of them smells like a different flavor of scented trash bag! But Arcana? Not in this house!!

What I’m trying to say, very badly, is that I like what Arcana Wildcraft is doing, even if I didn’t like everything I sampled. What I don’t like is that they seem to cycle out collections after 6-7 months? Terrible news for people like me that will sit on a FS purchase for literally 6 months.

I’m typically left pretty fatigued and unmotivated without drive.

Today, I took Vyvanse on an empty stomach with coffee (and ate 40 minutes later). I feel infinitely better today and it’s still working! 

I could feel it kick in—I had drive, motivation, and the ability to study/do boring work.

1m2ml81,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m2ml81,How would you transform this coffee table hi,"We have this old coffee table in our living room and it’s just so ugly and worn. 

Was considering using marble wallpaper to revamp it or painting it to give new life. Only concern is the kind of odd shape and slanted edges.

It’s heavy , but not concrete, some sort of painted plaster, lots of dents 

What would you do to make it over? ",1,1752794405.0,DIY,0,1.0,False
1m2ml59,https://www.reddit.com/r/JewsOfConscience/comments/1m2ml59/it_finally_happened/,It finally happened.,"My brother called me antisemitic.

When Israel was bombing Iran, i reposted a story that mocked the discourse and western response regarding the news of the bombing of Iran by Israel. Basically how Israel is not held to the same standard that Iran is.

The post ended with:
“You have to be incredibly stupid or just a flat out genocidal racist to believe the Western position on Israel / Iran”

When i reached out to my brother to see why he hadn’t been by the shop lately for coffee, he said, amongst many things, that my politics are repugnant and my views are antisemitic. He said im permanently lost to terrorist propaganda. He was incredibly condescending and used language to assert intellectual superiority, alleged my inability to think critically, said antizionism is antisemitism, & attacked me for “the way i am acting” after insulting me with the remark that i am antisemitic. ( for the record, i know he is a narcissist and that factors into a lot of this )

I am just shocked to have my family, my own brother, say truly such hateful things because of my disdain for the various and continuing war crimes of Israel. like, it’s not clocking to him that i am over-concerned with what is happening way the hell over there. I’m so bummed, even though I know this is how erratic narcissists act. Should i drop screenshots?

Anyway, just wanted to share. If you have stories of your family alleging that you’re antisemitic or a self-hating Jew, feel free to drop em in the comments ♥️",10,1752794401.0,JewsOfConscience,3,0.86,False

So, thanks to all the guys who posted instructions about their experience, it was less complicated than half the oil changes I've ever done. 

Oh man it was bad. Apparently never been done before in it's 164k miles, and it showed. Looked like a strongly brewed cup of coffee. I almost want to do it again in a month just to flush the rest. 

But it does already feel better, the slight hesitation through take off is basically gone, and just feels smoother all around. 

Next steps: spark plugs, coolant, and oil change because that's just about due again. Then it's time to focus on the cosmetics",3,1752794344.0,crz,2,1.0,False

1m2mhnp,https://www.reddit.com/r/StarWars/comments/1m2mhnp/naming_comvention_thoughts/,Naming comvention thoughts,"Mr Lucas already told us that he kept a notebook full of goofy names over the years as he was working out what to do next before 1977. 
The droids were all inspired by asking for things that had number codes as names.

Like give me R2, and D2

Or C3-PO

Wookiee was a deleted line in a different Lucas film said by some guy referring his good buddy named Wookey.
""I think i ran over a Wookey back there""

But here's my other list of thoughts

Boba Fett-Buffet or maybe even Boba (tea) mixed in

Bariss Offee-Barista Coffee

Obi Wan-*same droid convention* O-B-1

Jango was Django since westerns and samurai flicks were used as inspiration.

Wookiee/ieeWook/Ewok

Endor- and/or

Tatooine-Tattooing said by someone who couldn't pronounce a g in ""ing"" 

Mon Mothma- ""Mom""+""Mothra""

Chewbacca-""Chew""(ing To)""bacco""

Bossk- the handtool company ""Bosch"" I'm sure he was around many of these since ILM was on the forefront of movie visual inventions.

Bib Fortuna-Big Fortune
Greedo-Greed
Jabba the Hutt-Pizza the Hutt.   *lol*

Oolah- ""Ooh la la"" *she is nearly naked afterall*

Wat Tambor- ""Watts"" and ""Timbre"" both might have been seen on a single analog synthesizer.

Aura Singh- ""Aura""+""Sing""  I believe her character came about because of the scrapped female concepts of Darth Talon where she would seduce jedi and kill them. This was also subsequently turned into Asajj Ventresses characterization. One of the concept arts for Darth Maul's character is quite literally Aura Singh with her hair down in dreads.

I built a mini-web app where users describe an event (e.g. “coffee tasting pop-up with rustic look”), hit “Generate,” and get a ready-to-publish flyer in under a minute. It supports custom colors, layouts, and text placement automatically

Some of my early traction are positive feedback from users hosting book clubs, bake sales, and meetups. One organizer also said that “I’d spend hours designing; now it takes me two clicks.”

It was all so strange. She had been rushed to the hospital after her fall. The doctors and nurses had swarmed around her, all while she was in excruciating pain. The baby was coming. That was the only thought she could muster.

The baby was coming.

Why? How?

She had three weeks more. Three more weeks! But Jared had to come around and ruin everything, just like he always did.

Mr and Mrs Fuller must have rushed in when they heard the news, in between being drugged up and the excruciating pain she was feeling she could hear their voices, distant, worried. They kept asking about the baby, not her.

She didn't know what happened, it was all hazy. It was a mercy, that was what Lori knew. It was a mercy that fate had decided to wipe her memory.

Because she wouldn't be able to bear it.

***********

She had woken up the next morning, the lights in her hospital room were bright almost blinding. It took a while adjusting her eyes to the light. When her eyes were finally adjusted she saw that there was not a single soul in her hospital room. Nobody at all.

It wasn't like she was expecting anyone. Mr and Mrs Fuller either, they would be too excited with their new baby. They would have their hands full.

She tried to move her arms, but she was sore all over. So sore.

God it hurts. She thought as she closed her eyes in pain. She didn't know how long she had closed her eyes, willing herself to go back to sleep just to get rid of the pain.

Mercifully, a dark haired nurse walked in moments later.

""You're awake. That's good.""

She said and Lori tried to talk but her throat was so scratchy and dry. She tried to reach out to her nightstand, where there was a bottle of water but the simple movement caused her immense pain.

""Don't worry. I'll get it for you.""

The nurse said as she took the bottle of water.

She poured the water in a small plastic cup next to her nightstand and adjusted Lori's bed so she could sit properly and drink.

Lori took two sips and stopped.

""What happened?""

She asked as she looked around.

""You passed out right after your cesarean section. You had everybody worried and scared. The doctor thought you wouldn't make it.""

The nurse said as she dropped the cup back on the nightstand. She examined her vitals while scribbling on her notepad.

""Do you remember what happened?""

The nurse asked and Lori shook her head.

""I can't seem to remember. I only remember coming here...and the pain...""

She said said and the nurse nodded.

""Yes. You were in a lot of pain.""

The doctor walked in at that moment, he was tall, balding and had glasses on, Lori felt he looked vaguely familiar. She must have seen him when she got to the hospital.

""Good morning Ms Wyatt. How are you doing?""

He asked and Lori shrugged.

""I don't know how to feel, I'm sore all over. I'm in pain.""

She said and the doctor looked at the nurse. They seemed to exchange a look that she knew nothing about.

""Ms Wyatt you were in a very critical condition when you were rushed in last night.""

Lori nodded. Of course she was, she had gone into premature labour.

""We prepped you for an emergency c-section. The surgery was successful. Unfortunately, the baby died, by our reports it was distressed and also had a breathing anomaly.""

Lori was deathly quiet.

The baby didn't make it?!

What?!

""What?""

She said quietly and the doctor sighed.

""We did everything we could, but he didn't have much of a chance in the first place, we suspected that when you went into premature labour.""

The doctor added and Lori whimpered. The sound that came out of her mouth wasn't human. It didn't even sound like it came from her.

""Where is he now?""

She asked and the doctor sighed.

""A Mr and Mrs Fuller came to claim his body. They came with documents showing that you had given away your rights to be his mother.""

They couldn't even wait?!

Or let her see him?

""But! But! I haven't even seen him yet! They didn't let me see him!!!""

She cried out and the doctor and the nurse exchanged silent looks again.

""Ms Wyatt you were out for a long time and legally, they had every right to claim his body.""

Lori started moving in her bed, ignoring the blinding pain.

""Where is he? Where is he now?! I want to see my son!""

She shrieked as she placed one leg on the cold marble floor, the movement alone caused her great pain, but she managed it.

The nurse rushed to her side, her strong arms subduing her and trying to drag her back to the bed.

""You can't move now Ms Wyatt, you're not strong enough yet!""

She came close to Lori and Lori slapped her hand away with all her strength.

The doctor gave the nurse one look.

""Sedate her. She needs to rest.""

He said as he walked out of the room.

Another nurse rushed in at that moment, Lori was still crying, shrieking and batting away the nurse. The other nurse rushed in and pinned her down. Less than a minute, she felt drowsy and everything went blank.

***************

Gabriel Caine paced the corridors of the hospital ward, he was nervous, a little scared and a bit angry. Suzie was crazy. Very crazy. She didn't tell him she was going to labour. She wasn't due for another few days, he thought she was in the clear.

He had specifically told her to call him if she felt the baby was coming because he felt guilty enough leaving her alone when the baby was so close to being born. Unfortunately, she had chose not to listen to him.

He was in New York when Grace's call came in.

He had rushed down from New York back home. He got there as fast as he could, he got there in time, the baby was on the way, but had not arrived yet.

He was worried, his pack was equally worried to be honest.

Even though he and Suzie were a little more than strangers he still cared for her, in his own way.

Gabriel had met Suzie at the annual Alpha's convention that held in Canada. She was part of a different pack, a lesser pack, but she had been making googly eyes at him all through the night of the dinner party. He didn't know her, he didn't know much about her, only that she was a werewolf, albeit a werewolf of lower ranking.

He had planned to be on his best behaviour, so he ignored all her advances, but she caught up with him later at a bar he went to after the party was over and they both drank

a lot and ended up in an hotel room.

He had woken up the next day, naked and already regretting his actions. He left the hotel room before she woke up, dropping off some cash for her on the nightstand so she could get herself home.

He didn't even leave a number for her to call.

Three months later, Gabriel was back from a run when his beta gave him his phone claiming he had a urgent call from a strange woman named Suzie. He had forgotten all about her by then, but only accepted the call out of courtesy.

Suzie claimed she was pregnant and at first he had been outraged, but then he calmed down. He paid for her flight to Denver and made her take a DNA test.

It came out positive, the baby was his. Suzie vehemently protested to keep it, Gabriel agreed, he had no other intentions.

Of course he was mildly disappointed in himself. It was not often that the alpha of one of the most prestigious packs in the world fathered an illegitimate child. Even his own family had been surprised.

Suzie moved in quickly, he had no qualms with that, he only made her know her place. Yes, she was the mother of his child, but she would never be his mate or his Luna, those positions were left unoccupied, till his mate came along.

Suzie tended to ignore that and tried to boss his betas around, still, he tolerated her excesses because she was the mother of his child.

He had left briefly, for a business trip only to get the scary call that she had gone into labour.

The doctor walked out of the theatre, walking briskly while taking off his bloody gloves.

He had a grim look on his face, his heartbeat was racing.

""Mr Caine... I'm sorry.""

Gabriel clenched his jaw, bracing himself for the news.

""We lost the mother. But you have a beautiful baby girl.""

Though he felt guilty of it, a little bit of his tension slipped away after hearing the last part.

""Ms Garcia went into cardiac arrest right after the delivery, we had no idea of her medical history, if we had known, we might have saved her.""

Gabriel nodded, still at a loss for words.

""Can I see my daughter now please?""

He asked and the doctor nodded.

Soon after the nurse came out wheeling the baby out of the theatre and Gabriel approached her to look.

She was crying, screaming bloody murder and Gabriel's heart broke at the sound. At the shrill voice.

His daughter was going to grow up without a mother.

She was going to grow up without Suzie.

Somewhere in his heart, Gabriel felt like he had already failed her.

Chapter 2.
Despite being heavily sedated, Lori woke up not well rested. And her whole body hurt. Like hell.
She had nightmares too. A baby crying, a wrapped baby in a crib crying and crying. And whenever she tried to reach the baby, it felt like the baby strayed farther

away from her.

The next morning, she didn't feel better, just equally worse. No visitors still. Just a phone call and a text message from her co worker Birdie, who was asking her when she would get back to work.

She had not given her proper notice to why she had missed work. She would text her boss later to inform him.

Ugh. She felt sick inside. Truly sick.

Worse still, she had a new problem, her boobs. They were huge and rock hard. She touched them and winced.

The pain she was feeling was unimaginable.

The nurse walked in with her breakfast tray, weird, She couldn't remember eating the night before, had she gone to bed hungry?

How long was she sedated?!

""Good morning Lori. How do you feel?""

Lori shrugged.

""I feel even worse. My boobs ache so bad.""

She said as she reached for her tray. She was very hungry.

There was chocolate pudding, green beans and scrambled eggs.

""Oh it happens! Sorry about that but they're going to be very sore for a few days.""

""What? Why?""

She asked and the nurse sighed.

""Well, your body has already prepared itself for a baby, so you're lactating.""

""But I don't have a baby. I lost mine.""

Lori said bitterly as she stabbed her plastic fork on the green beans, attacking it with ferocity.

""Yes. I know you did. And it's a horrible thing really.""

Her voice was sympathetic but Lori was sure the woman would never be able to understand the magnitude of pain she was going through.

""I can offer you a better solution to your aching boobs if you want.""

The nurse said as she looked at her hopefully.

""What is that?""

""There is a baby on this floor, she was born the exact same time your baby was born, sadly, her mother didn't make it. She cried all through the night. We fed her formula but, she's not taking it very well. If you donate your milk it could help her.""

Lori sat there for a while, she remembered the cries in her dream. Had she dreamt about a baby crying or was there a baby truly crying?

""Yes.""

Lori said without hesitation and the nurse widened her eyes.

""Yes? Are you sure?""

Lori nodded.

""I am sure.""

She said and the nurse smiled.

""Thank you. I know how hard this is for you.""

She said and Lori scoffed as she looked away. Oh she had no idea.

""I will come back with pumps then have a quick talk with the girl's family to inform them.""

The nurse left and Lori had her breakfast quietly.

Twenty minutes later the nurse came back with pumps like she had said and talked about how the child's father had quickly agreed.

The nurse left with her milk, murmuring something about the milk being screened first.

Lori went back to sleep, the doctor came back to do a checkup on her. Her

c- section scar was healing quite nicely he had told her.

Lori had murmured something about the hospital bill and her doctor had told her the Fullers had cleared the hospital bill.

Good. Because there was no way she would have paid for it herself, she didn't have a dime to her name.

Besides it was in the agreement that they would settle all hospital bills. She only wished they had let her see him before taking him away.

****************

Gabriel didn't leave the hospital, even though he didn't sleep a wink, he didn't leave, he couldn't just bear the thought of leaving his daughter alone.

He had not picked out a name yet, partially because he and Suzie had not come up with one. He wanted her name to be perfect, whatever it is he came up with had to be perfect.

After the baby was born and the doctor told him Suzie didn't make it, he had quietly made her funeral arrangements. Suzie didn't have any family, at least none that he knew of.

Her only family was her daughter.

He remembered when he first held her in his arms, she had immediately stopped crying as he stroked her head gently.

She was so tiny. So so tiny, but when she looked at him, when she really looked at him, the world stopped.

Nothing else mattered at that point, Gabriel knew at that moment he would fight tooth and nail to protect her.

By all tests and count, baby Caine was a healthy child.

She was fine, totally fine, the doctor reassured him many times while begging him to go home and get some rest.

But why was she still crying! He heard enough of her crying to now recognise the sound of her voice. The nurse said she was hungry. Just hungry, she was taking the formula, but it didn't seem to be enough for her. She was ravenous.

Gabriel knew the reason. She wasn't only a baby, she was a pup, a werewolf pup, she would be insatiable. Pups were usually like that while growing up. Unfortunately, Suzie's milk that would have sustained her was now gone.

Gone.

He would be there for her. always.

""Good news Mr Caine.""

A nurse walked in the private waiting room where he stayed when his daughter took her naps in the nursery.

The nurse had come in earlier to tell him they found a donor for her. A woman who was willing to donate her breast milk.

The nurse assured him that after they had screened the breastmilk they would let his daughter have it.

He was relieved, greatly relieved about that. It wouldn't be the same like her mother's but it would be something...

He was so deep in thoughts that he didn't notice his beta and his housekeeper walk in.

""Oh Gabriel! I heard the news! I am so sorry!""

Mrs Grace said as she ran towards him and hugged him.

Gabriel sighed, settling into her hug for a few seconds before pulling away.

""I am sorry Gabriel. Deeply sorry. Suzie didn't deserve this. She wanted to be a mother.""

Draco said.

Gabriel nodded.

""Thank you. Her presence would be missed. Her daughter is already missing her...""

He said and Mrs Grace sat next to him.""

""And how is your little girl?""

""She's good. She's very healthy.""

Mrs Grace seemed to sigh.

""Oh thank the goddess. By the way, you look so tired, we've been waiting for you to come back to the house. Why don't you go home and take a shower and get some rest.""

She asked and Gabriel shrugged.

""I don't want to leave her alone here. Besides, it's only a few more hours and we'll leave. We just want to settle a few things, especially with Suzie's body.""

Suzie had no family that he knew. If she had family, she never mentioned them.

He had no choice but to take charge of her funeral, and bury her in his family crypt. She deserved that honor.

""I know. But you need some rest. And the full moon is in a few hours. Grace can stay and watch the baby.""

Gabriel sighed

How could he forget? It was a full moon, all the heightened emotions and stress he was going through was going to make the full moon a lot more worse.

Draco was right.

He nodded.

""Fine. I'll leave you in charge Grace. I'll go talk to the doctor.""

He said as he stood up and walked out of the waiting room.

**Two days later.**

.

She was cleared. She could leave, even though she was still sore.

She had met a woman named Grace Miler, she seemed to be the caretaker of the little girl who lost her mother.

They would come over to her place to pick up the milk every three days. The woman was also kind enough to give her pumps, bags to store milk, breast covers and all kinds of things that would make it easier for her to pump.

The arrangement was pretty flexible too, Lori could break it off at any time without any explanation. She liked that.

Then the woman had asked her if she would like to see the little girl and Lori had flat out refused.

It would be too much. It was already was too much, giving so much. She only did it because she knew that the baby genuinely needed her help. And she wanted to help, but no, she would not get attached.

She tried to call the Fullers, they wouldn't pick her call. All she wanted from them was a damn explanation! And a location.

Her baby's grave. She wanted to see her baby's grave.

But no, they wouldn't even give her that right.

She left the hospital different from how she came in, the only difference this time was that she was alone. And she was going back to her shitty life and her shitty job.

She felt empty. She was empty. Her tummy had gone down drastically, the bump she had five days ago was nowhere to be found, just like the baby that was once in her womb.

And she looked drained. She remembered standing in front of the mirror in the bathroom on the day she was to be discharged and feeling hollow. She was pale, paler than her Mediterranean skin had ever looked and her lips were pale.

As she applied make up to conceal her ghostly appearance, she quickly realised that nothing was strong enough to hide the heavy bags under her sunken eyes.

It was of no use! There was nothing she could do that would work! Anyone who took one look at her would be able to see that she was hiding something.

How would she ever recover from this?

Chapter 3.
It was cruel sometimes. Most times, how life never stopped. It didn't stop for Lori's pain. She couldn't even take the time out to mourn properly, or she would lose her job. So barely two days at home, Lori was back at the diner working her shift as usual.

Almost as if nothing had happened.

Almost as if she didn't just lose a baby last week.

It had been two weeks and no, the pain didn't stop she just found a way to live with it.

It was common knowledge to all her coworkers that she was giving the baby up for adoption. Very common knowledge, so when Birdie had found her crying mid shift in the bathroom, her question had been,

'But you never wanted the baby in the first place. I don't understand why you're sad now.""

Her words were guttural, like a knife severing her insides. She had instantly wiped her tears and went back to work, she had not spoken to Birdie again after that.

The only part of her day that seemed to give her a brief moment of joy was when Mrs Grace came to pick up the milk for the baby.

Lori managed to pump in the mornings and after work, then she would bag, date and freeze the milk.

They had agreed on every three days, but for some reason Lori couldn't stop producing more milk so Mrs Grace sometimes had to come the next day, she wondered if she was making it worse by donating the milk.

Mrs Grace was very kind. Sometimes when she came over to pick up the milk she'd bring Lori food to eat. Home cooked meals. Once she brought her lasagna and the other day it was a key lime pie.

She also never seemed to tire about giving Lori progress about the baby despite the fact that Lori feigned disinterest whenever she talked about the baby.

They had finally gotten around to naming her. Her name was Emilia. Emilia Caine. They sometimes called her Emmy for short.

Jared had also not come around, perhaps he was still feeling guilty about everything. After all, if he hadn't pushed her she wouldn't have gone into premature labour.

A part of her was glad that he had stayed away, although, knowing him he would never stay away for too long. She prayed and hoped that he was away for good now.

She needed stability in her life. Stability and normalcy.

Jared was a chapter she desperately needed to close. She had been trying to close that chapter for months.

""Lori! Table three needs a refill!""

Birdie called out and Lori nodded her head as she walked over to the table with a jug of coffee in her hand.

""Hey! I've seen you here before. Didn't you use to be pregnant?""

He asked and Lori nodded.

""Yes. I was.""

The man's eyes raked all over her in a look she knew all too well.

""Wow. You look great! I mean for someone who just had a baby you look smoking hot!""

He commented and Lori forced a smile. Unsolicited comments and

terrible compliments, it was just the kind of stuff she usually dealt with at the diner.

""Thanks.""

She murmured as she left his table.

Hot?

She didn't feel hot. Nothing about her felt hot.

She was hurt. Hurt and broken. And she feared that she might never recover from the pain that she was feeling, the brutal gnawing in her chest.

She was still deep in her feeling and didn't notice when a man walked into the diner.

She was focused on wiping a table that had a kid had made a mess on.

""Ms Wyatt? Are you Ms Wyatt?""

A deep voice asked.

Lori didn't even turn.

""Yes.""

She answered. After she was done, she turned and found a tall man right in front of her.

She took a small step back.

He was tall. Something about his presence was towering.

Domineering.

Very tall.

Probably six foot two, he was wearing a charcoal black suit, tailored and cut to suit every inch of his body. He had short dark hair, his face was clean shaven except for the tiny mustache he kept, he had deeply unsettling blue eyes that looked too blue to be natural, a jaw that could cut through ice and cheekbones so beautiful they made his face look like he was molded by some perfect god.

She swallowed hard and looked away, catching herself staring, he had that effect on people and he was probably happy that he did.

""Can we sit and talk somewhere?""

He asked and Lori glanced at Birdie who was watching her like a hawk.

""Right now? I'm on my shift.""

""Who are you?""

She asked.

""I'm Gabriel Caine. The father of the little baby you have been donating your milk to these past two weeks.""

""Oh. I'm not due to meet Grace till later today.""

Lori mused and the man nodded.

""I know.. I just wanted to talk to you.""

Birdie was already approaching them now.

Lori glanced at her and scowled.

""Okay. I finish in ten minutes, can it be after my shift? I'm already on probation and I don't want to annoy my boss any further.""

She said and he nodded.

""Okay. I will wait for you in that black car outside.""

He said as he pointed to the sleek black car that was outside. Without one more word, he walked out of the diner.

After her shift, Lori went into the locker room and changed.

Good thing she had at least worn something decent. Her faded red dress and old doc martens boots were at least still presentable.

As she walked out of the diner, Mr Gabriel Caine was already out of his car and moving to the other side to open the door for her.

A gentleman?

Wow surprising. Lori couldn't think of the time a man opened the door for her.

As she stepped into the luxury car, she could immediately smell his cologne, she had caught a whiff of it in the diner, but here it was all she could smell in the car. Incredibly sexy, musky and confident. She smoothed her hand over the leather of the car seat, it was probably worth more than she had ever seen in her entire life.

Damn, it must cost a lot.

She had suspected that baby Emilia's family was comfortable, she just didn't know they were so rich.

""First of all, I want to thank you for your help. Your kindness, towards my daughter even in your own pain is admirable.""

""I don't know how to ever repay you.""

Lori shook her head.

""I don't need payment Mr Caine.""

Grace had certainly offered, the first day she had come to pick up the milk and she jsd seen her apartment complex. She had offered.

""I know. And under normal circumstances I wouldn't offer you but I have a proposal for you Ms Wyatt.""

""A proposal?""

Lori repeated.

What could a rich well to do man like Mr Gabriel Caine possibly have to do with someone like her?

""As you already know, Grace is the sole caretaker of my daughter. She has been taking care of her since she was born.""

""Emilia lost her mother at birth.""

Lori nodded.

""But Grace is old and she tires easily. We decided on getting a nanny and Grace mentioned that you're the only person she would recommend.""

""A nanny?!""

Lori exclaimed and Gabriel nodded.

""I will respect your decision to decline Ms Wyatt but I would also be equally relieved if you decide to take on the job. I intend to reward you handsomely for your services.""

He said as he passed her a contract.

Lori took it with shaky hands.

Was this really happening?

She skimmed through the pages. The sum of ten thousand dollars per month in addition to added benefits hit her.

Whattt?

Ten thousand dollars?!

The requirements were pretty simple, she was to be a live in nanny,

responsible for taking care of Emilia and provide her with

love and care.

""What do you think?""

The man asked and Lori opened her mouth but no words came out.

Slowly, she cleared her throat and looked at him, he was staring at her intently, watching her every move, her every emotion like a hawk.

""I need time to read through the contract

and think about your offer.""

She said as she gulped hard.

He nodded.

""Fair enough. But you have until tomorrow evening. Here's my card.""

He handed her a crisp business card.

""Once you make your choice, call me. A car would come to pick up you and your luggage.""

After she got out of his car, she watched him drive away while she clutched the document in mild shock.

**Hi everyone,**



My partner and I (both foreigners, 36 years old, currently sponsored by the Australian government) are expecting our first baby in December. After years of trying naturally, it finally happened, we’re beyond grateful and excited!



I wanted to reach out to this community for advice and guidance, to ensure we're not missing anything important. Here’s a quick rundown of our current situation:

We have a combined annual income of $190K. I work in marketing, and my partner is a primary school teacher. As soon as we found out about the pregnancy, we opened a separate bank account exclusively for baby-related expenses. We each contributed $15K from our savings, and as of now, the account has $45K. I'm confident we’ll reach around $65K by January or February next year.



What really caught us off guard was the cost of childcare. Back home, it’s heavily subsidised and rarely exceeds $60/day, here, the cheapest we found in Sydney, Alexandria, is for $150/day, which caused quite a bit of stress.



We're currently renting a very spacious 1-bedroom, 1-bath apartment for $720/week. The bedroom is large enough for us to stay comfortably for at least another year, so we've decided to hold off on moving. We don’t own a car, but we’ve looked into services like Carly that offer weekly subscriptions for mid-to-high-end vehicles starting around $250/week. Does anyone thinks that's worth it, or if buying a second-hand car makes more sense long-term?

So far, we’ve only bought a few essentials, a brand new sofa for her recovery, a comfortable chair for breastfeeding, a pregnancy pillow, oils, vitamins, and a few maternity clothes. Thanks to her reciprocal Medicare agreement, we haven’t had any out-of-pocket hospital expenses yet.

I also went back to my old side gig bartending at weddings and events, just four shifts a month, which gives me some “pocket money” (about 700-900 per month) for things like transport, coffee, movies, or clothes (I quit drinking a while ago). 



Recently, we received an invitation from the NSW Government to apply for Permanent Residency. We’re still deciding whether to take it. My wife has become a pillar in our local community, and we’ve been encouraged by many to accept the PR and stay longer, potentially upgrading to a larger place over time. We’ve managed to stretch her maternity leave to six months, and I’m considering requesting two unpaid leave days per week after that to help more at home.

Here are my main questions:

* Are there any major expenses we might be overlooking?
* If we do become PR, would there be any government support for my employer during my absence (e.g., if I take unpaid leave)?
* Are 50k per year enough for baby expenses in Sydney, Australia?



Thank you for taking the time to read this! And a massive shout-out to all Australian parents juggling mortgages, personal loans, strata, education, and still showing up every day. You have my deepest respect and admiration.",3,1752793864.0,BabyBumpsandBeyondAu,3,0.67,False

1m2mbnn,https://i.redd.it/g0c80rakjidf1.jpeg,I made Plenny Shake ice cream (game changer!!),"I have been using Plenny Shake for the past year to help my weight loss (50lbs down along my journey so far!) and when I learned about the Ninja Creami and I knew what I had to try. The results were fantastic, it tastes just like ice cream while adding minimal calories (this whole pint came out to 465 calories!). I just tried the chocolate today but I am excited to see with what I can cook up (chill up?) with all the flavors.

My Recipe:

Plenny Shake chocolate - 94g (400kcal)

Sugar free choclate pudding mix - 7g (25kcal)

Erythritol - 20g (0kcal) 

Splenda baking blend- 3 tsp (Its what I had on hand but any other 0cal sweetener will do)

Xanthan gum - 1/4tsp

Salt - 1/8tsp

Instant Coffee - 1 1/2tsp (optional)

Unsweetened vanilla almond milk - 300ml (40kcal but will need a bit more to top off mixture to the fill line)

Zero sugar chocolate syrup - 31g (10kcal)

Mix/blend together and pour into the pint container and freeze for 24 hours. When you take it out run the outside of the pint with warm water for 30 sec to slightly thaw then run the pint in the machine under the lite ice cream setting. After the cycle open the pint and scrap the ice off the insides and run the outsides under mildly cold water for another 30 seconds then either use the re-spin or mix-in setting to get the ice cream to the correct consistency (use mix-in for a more traditional creamy ice cream or re-spin for a more frosty texture).",2,1752793707.0,JimmyJoyFood,2,1.0,False

Real approval times & collateral headaches,"I've been running a small coffee roastery for two years (about $480 k revenue last year) and I'm looking for roughly $350 k to scale production and add a street‑front café. My local bank pointed me straight at an SBA 7(a), calling it the ""cleanest"" route.

I've combed through the official SBA docs and even chatted with the crew at SBA Loans HQ - super helpful, gave me a tidy checklist - and on paper they say 45‑60 days is doable if the file is rock‑solid. Sounds great, but I'd love to hear from folks who’ve actually been through it:

1. How long did it really take from a complete application to money in the account? (especially if you closed in 2024/25)
2. Personal collateral - if your home equity didn't cover the gap, did the bank throw liens on other assets too? Anyone manage to negotiate lighter terms?
3. .Any curveballs: extra paperwork, redone projections, surprise fees?",17,1752793676.0,smallbusiness,3,0.96,False

1m2ma88,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForeverAloneDating/comments/1m2ma88/42_m4f_france_i_am_english_living_in_france_i/,42 [M4F] France I am English living in France i have been very honest about myself on this post I am seeking a serious relationship with a nice lady this is a long post,"Hi there thanks for reading my post this is a very long post please read it in full before messaging me. 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I’m really not interested I don’t know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I’ve had no previous relationships in fact I’ve never really dated and I’ve never been on dating apps. I won’t bring any drama into your life. 

I’d like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am and I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. You’ll find out a lot about me on this post. I am seeking a woman that is in her late 20s that's aged 25 to 32  and Please be mature 

I’m generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don’t have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy that loves talking on voice chat. 

I also don’t like swearing I rarely use bad language vulgar language on online chats or face to face  I am not that type of guy. I also don’t like those that think it’s okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.  

I am not one that is into partying I don’t like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I’m not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going  to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I’m very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I’ve never been tempted by anyone and I’d never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don’t view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I’d have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I’ve never been on loads of dates I’m not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that’s it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don’t want to use the actual word for it and I don’t smoke I don’t drink heavily and I’ve never touched any illegal drugs. I’ve got no bad addictions or bad habits I’ve lived a very clean life. 

I’m not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy. 

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I’m in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I’ve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I’d love o have someone that loves swimming

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I’m not bad at it and I’d again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it’s not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don’t just want to settle I’ve never just wanted to settle I’m seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I’d never have an affair or a fling and I’m not into ever having an open relationship. 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it’s amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I’m very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don’t know.

I also love animals I have a dog she’s a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she’s absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don’t drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don’t drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can’t ever see myself going either way.  

I have to be honest and tell you that I don’t drive I have never passed my test. I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I’m not someone that likes living by myself

I will also tell you that I don’t work at the moment please be okay with all of this from the get go I’ve had terrible trouble trying to find suitable jobs but I have got plans for the future for things I’m not lazy or anything like that. I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I’ve had trouble finding suitable work as I said. 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe.

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I’m not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won’t be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don’t fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I’m very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I’m in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I’m always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don’t aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don’t watch reality tv. I don’t watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it’s how I’ve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I’d never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don’t wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I’d prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don’t wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message! Please can you tell me what you love about being a woman in your message and your age and location and more about you please don’t just say hi or hello I’m unlikely to respond to messages with low effort!
