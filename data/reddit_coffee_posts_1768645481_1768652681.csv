Hope you’re all enjoying the great weather!

As some of you know, I launched [**freemalta.com**](https://freemalta.com/) about 5 days ago. Since then, I’ve been working on what I believe is the most useful **Tax and Employment Guide** for our community.

In my 12 years here, I’ve seen so many people lost when it comes to taxes, social contributions, and leave entitlements. The problem is that most accounting firms and consultants talk to you like you're already a tax expert.

They make it complicated; sometimes on purpose, just to get leads.

I wanted to change that. I’ve tried to explain everything like we’re talking over a coffee, you know simple, clear, and honest.

**What’s in the new edition:**

* **Detailed Tax Rates & FAQ:** Who is eligible for what, without the headache.
* **Social Contributions:** Exactly how much is being deducted from your paycheck.
* **Leave Entitlements:** Vacation leave, bereavement leave, COLA, etc.
* **Digital Nomads:** Eligibility criteria and the specific rates you need to know.
* **2026 Parent Rates:** Explaining the upcoming changes for parents and how payroll adjustments will work (it’s a bit of a mess for employers right now!).

I’ve put a lot of heart into this to make sure it’s a ""one-stop shop"" for everyone living and working in Malta.

Please check it out, share it with anyone who might find it useful, and **please let me know if there’s anything else you want me to add.** I’m building this for us!

1qfbrsy,https://www.reddit.com/r/justanotherbabymama/comments/1qfbrsy/good_morning/,Good morning ❤️,"Since my last post, I realized there were a few key moments I hadn’t included, and honestly they deserve their own thread.

Let’s start with the Jeep saga 🚙

• A bought a used Jeep from a random follower before moving to CA.

• She then drove that same Jeep from WI to CA… and back again.

• Since then, it has needed repairs — shocking, I know.

She posted a mechanic’s bill and complained along the lines of “this bitch expects me to pay her when it needs all this work.”

The bill listed:

• CV axle

• brakes

• oil change

Which…

• Brakes and oil changes are routine maintenance.

• CV axles wear, especially after cross-country road trips.

• It’s a USED vehicle, not a brand-new one off the lot.

Driving a used car across multiple states and then being mad it needs maintenance is certainly a choice.

Now for the safety concerns 😬

• She posted a video of herself driving with her two oldest boys unbuckled.

• They are still children and do not meet height/weight requirements to be out of car seats or boosters.

• Regardless of WI seatbelt laws, basic parenting would suggest buckling your kids… but you know 🗑️

Additionally:

• The Jeep does not safely accommodate her and all of her children.

• She has openly posted about how “in WI it’s okay to hit your kids” (her wording, not mine), which… yikes.

Medical timeline confusion (again):

• She has posted multiple times about being hospitalized for an infected tooth.

• That involved pain, medications, and X-rays.

• This overlaps with the current alleged miscarriage storyline.

So we now have:

• infected tooth

• pain meds

• medical imaging

• alleged pregnancy loss

The timeline is, once again, not adding up.

And finally  the puppy 🐶

• She either bought or was “gifted” a puppy.

• Someone agreed to babysit it.

• That person now allegedly refuses to return the puppy.

Honestly?

Given that she is currently homeless, that might be the most stable outcome in this entire situation. But I would like to create a memo to whoever won’t return the puppy that her children are homeless too, maybe take them 😂

All of this is based on her own posts and videos.

No speculation, no reaching, just repeating what she’s publicly shared.

At this point, the pattern is painfully clear:

• poor decisions

• zero accountability

• outrage when consequences show up

Anyway, that’s all for now while I sip my coffee and wait for the next inevitable update. ☕️",1,1768652212.0,justanotherbabymama,0,1.0,False

*The island is home to a massive deposit of rare earths, which are crucial to U.S. efforts to maintain its technological lead over China. But tapping them isn't so easy.*

[Global AI race makes Greenland's critical minerals a tempting target](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/greenland-rare-earths-critical-minerals-rcna254177)

[The Tanbreez rare earth minerals site rings a fjord near Narsarsuaq, the gateway settlement to southern Greenland. Carsten Snejbjerg \/ Bloomberg via Getty Images filer](https://preview.redd.it/laos69ra8wdg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c2b4bdf168d0384573df96204b756a94e675435)

How valuable would Greenland’s rare earth minerals be to the U.S.? It can depend on who — and when — you ask.

With President Donald Trump recently revisiting his interest in making the island part of the U.S., Greenland’s national security upsides — including many important minerals crucial for modern technology — have again become the subject of geopolitical importance.

In an interview with The Hill this week, [House Speaker Mike Johnson said](https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5686591-speaker-johnson-greenland-troops/) that America’s pursuit of Greenland “has to do with national security and critical minerals and many other reasons.” However, in December, [Trump said](https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-announces-louisiana-governor-greenland-special-envoy-2025-12-22/), “We need Greenland for national security, not for minerals.”

Despite that split, there is broad agreement that [Greenland holds untapped deposits](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20251104-the-story-behind-the-scramble-for-greenlands-rare-earths) of critical minerals and rare earth elements. What is far from clear is just how much or whether it would be worth the effort for the U.S. to mine them.

“I think it’s a great idea to expand America’s presence in Greenland to counter Russia and China,” said Ted Feldmann, an expert on mineral exploration and the founder of Durin Mining Technologies. “But I don’t think we should go there for the minerals.”

The U.S. Geological Survey [identifies 60 minerals](https://www.usgs.gov/news/science-snippet/interior-department-releases-final-2025-list-critical-minerals) as critical for the American economy and national security. A subset of these minerals, termed “rare earth elements,” like neodymium and dysprosium, are necessary for manufacturing the magnets and motors that power America’s tech industry, while others are key for the semiconductors driving the artificial intelligence boom.

Access to rare earth minerals is seen as a key choke point for many of today’s high-tech supply chains. China, one of America’s tech rivals, has grown to dominate the rare earths production and refining market and has used access to rare earths [as a negotiating chip with Trump](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/business-news/china-outlines-controls-exports-rare-earths-technology-rcna236712). On Thursday, a bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers introduced legislation to establish [a $2.5 billion strategic reserve of rare earths](https://www.axios.com/2026/01/15/congress-rare-minerals-reserve-proposal).

Due to ancient geological processes, Greenland hosts a variety of valuable ore and mineral deposits, from [gold and iron to copper and graphite](https://www.csis.org/analysis/greenland-rare-earths-and-arctic-security). Yet much of the country’s resources remain untapped due to the island’s isolation, harsh conditions, [environmental stewardship](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2025/mar/05/greenland-mining-energy-transition-minerals-environmental-laws-uranium-rare-earth-toxic-waste-investor-state-dispute-settlement-isds-aoe) and the mining industry’s price sensitivity. [According to the USGS](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2025/mcs2025-rare-earths.pdf), Greenland has the largest rare earth reserves of any territory or country in the world with no active mines.

[Notes: Map based on Greenland Polar Stereographic projections for respective land masses.Source: Natural EarthGraphic: Jiachuan Wu \/ NBC News](https://preview.redd.it/4hbcojlf8wdg1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=a4e92518caaf3542322d36edfd1508ac54198045)

Feldmann said he is skeptical that the concentrations of minerals in Greenland would merit the investment required.

“The [Tanbreez deposit](https://www.criticalmetalscorp.com/projects/project-tanbreez/) in southern Greenland is supposedly one of the biggest rare earth mineral deposits in the world, but the mineral there just holds such a small percentage of the valuable metal that it probably isn’t economically viable to ship,” Feldmann told NBC News.

In addition to its rare earth supply, which is the world’s third-largest known land deposit, Greenland also boasts extensive stores of germanium and gallium, two critical minerals needed for high-tech applications.

Germanium is a key component in fiber-optic wires, while gallium is used in semiconductors required for many consumer electronics, power supplies, data centers and even quantum devices. China currently controls around [98% of gallium](https://pubs.usgs.gov/periodicals/mcs2023/mcs2023-gallium.pdf) and [around 60% of germanium](https://naturalresources.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=416731) supplies worldwide, with particular dominance in the refining of minerals once they have been extracted, and [leverages this dominance in trade negotiations](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/china-suspends-ban-exports-gallium-germanium-antimony-us-2025-11-09/) with the U.S.

“There are lots of rare earths around the world, but the issue is refining them,” said Jack Lifton, co-chairman of the Critical Minerals Institute, highlighting the shortage of American expertise in the refining of rare earths. “The American rare earth industry could fit inside of a large bus,” Lifton added.

[Members of the Danish armed forces during a military drill in Kangerlussuaq, Greenland, in September.Guglielmo Mangiapane \/ Reuters file](https://preview.redd.it/ulcqs1nj8wdg1.png?width=1720&format=png&auto=webp&s=3e4fde41d12c06cb43530654fa3e2a89f459e83c)

Though Greenland has over 140 active mineral licenses, which must be issued before mines can be constructed, there are [only two active mines](https://www.csis.org/analysis/greenland-rare-earths-and-arctic-security) in Greenland today.

CEO Eldur Olafsson of [Amaroq Ltd.](https://www.amaroqminerals.com/), the company behind one of the two active mines, argues his company’s gold mine in southern Greenland proves that Greenlandic mining operations are possible with the right approach.

“Denmark is not really a resource-driven country, so the capital support up until this date has not been enough to get more mining going,” Olafsson told NBC News. “For mining you need more than money. You also need people. You need to physically move people and build infrastructure, make roads, bridges, harbors, all of these different things.”

Even Greenland’s harsh climate and sparse population — around 60,000 people live across the territory — do not dissuade Olafsson. “It’s important to remember that Alaska, Canada, Norway, Sweden and Russia all have mines, some very big mines, across the Arctic region. These are among the best mines you can find in the world.”

“We always need new mining areas, or we need to reprocess metal, to have enough metal for the revolution that is coming, which is AI and similar technology.” Olafsson said.

[Geologist Greg Barnes, former owner of the Tanbreez rare earth minerals site, holds up a rock containing crystals at a mining site near Narsarsuaq in southern Greenland.Carsten Snejbjerg \/ Bloomberg via Getty Images file](https://preview.redd.it/6s69hjho8wdg1.png?width=1120&format=png&auto=webp&s=b5efffa300f6d684f0b3df1b470777bf084cb390)

Yet even after a mine is operational, fluctuations in mineral prices can force mines to shutter — as happened with the Black Angel lead-zinc mine at Maarmorilik in west Greenland. Operational from 1973 until 1990, the mine was shut down with substantial untapped reserves but failed to reopen [due to low zinc prices](https://eng.geus.dk/media/13331/go02_2ed.pdf).

To support America’s rare earth industry and address this price sensitivity, the Department of Defense in July [entered into a unique 10-year public-private partnership](https://mpmaterials.com/news/mp-materials-announces-transformational-public-private-partnership-with-the-department-of-defense-to-accelerate-u-s-rare-earth-magnet-independence/) with American mining company MP Materials to bolster America’s rare earth supply chain and wean America’s magnet supply chains off of Chinese sources with a rare earth mine in Colorado.

On the other side of the equator, Venezuela has not escaped the invocation of critical minerals as grounds for American intervention. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said last week that in Venezuela, “you have steel, you have minerals, all the critical minerals. They have a great mining history that’s gone rusty.”

But Lifton, of the Critical Minerals Institute, is skeptical. “We do not know anything about rare earths in Venezuela. I’ve been in this business for decades. I’ve never heard of Venezuela mentioned as a source of rare earths.”

***Instead, Lifton chalked up the invocation of critical materials in Venezuela to political naivete. “People who don’t have any idea what they’re talking about are talking about rare earths in Venezuela. I mean, my God, this is ridiculous.”***

[Trump initiates a critical minerals blitz - Metal Tech News](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2026/01/21/tech-metals/trump-initiates-a-critical-minerals-blitz/2612.html)

https://preview.redd.it/a6bm3pib6wdg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d64eb51d35d1cbade804847e161fab84c0af7e0

# Executive order gives US trade officials six months to negotiate critical minerals supply deals with allies.

With critical minerals being essential inputs into nearly every facet of the United States' economic and national security, President Donald Trump has signed an executive order directing Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer to negotiate agreements with global partners to secure these vital materials.

""While prioritizing domestic production, today's action will also build upon the landmark critical minerals agreements President Trump has secured with key allies and partners, including Australia, Saudi Arabia, Malaysia, Thailand, Japan, and others, to diversify global supply chains and reduce dependence on adversarial nations,"" the White House stated in a Jan. 14 fact sheet.

The first executive order of 2026 on critical minerals follows a six-month Commerce Department investigation, which found that the U.S. – already heavily reliant on China –cannot build its domestic supply fast enough to keep pace with soaring demand for materials essential to military systems, clean energy, high-tech manufacturing, and everyday consumer goods.

""Contributing to the increased United States demand are vital national security and economic activities, including rising military threats and growing high-tech industries, such as artificial intelligence, data centers, nuclear energy, and new energy technologies,"" Trump stated in the executive order.

https://preview.redd.it/snvgirpj6wdg1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e63eca0688a00dd616da4b689caffcffb23c1bd

Lutnick emphasized in the report that securing both domestic and allied sources of critical minerals and derivative products – such as semiconductors and rare earth magnets – is a national imperative.

Without directly naming China, Trump echoed the report's conclusion that the volumes and sourcing of processed critical minerals and their derivative products (PCMDPs) entering the U.S. present a threat to national security.

""I determine that it is necessary and appropriate to enter into negotiations with trading partners to adjust the imports of PCMDPs so that such imports will not threaten to impair the national security of the United States,"" he said.

Gracelin Baskaran, director of the Critical Minerals Security Program at the Center for Strategic & International Studies in Washington, says the executive order ""signals a shift toward global supply chain cooperation as a pillar of U.S. economic and national security strategy, rather than unilateral self-sufficiency.""

Allied countries that want to take advantage of this policy shift to integrate their PCMDPs into U.S. supply chains have a six-month window – the timeframe Trump provided Lutnick and Greer to lock in definitive critical mineral agreements.

""Depending on the outcome of such negotiations, I may consider alternative remedies in the future, including minimum import prices for specific types of critical minerals,"" Trump said.

# Trump lays negotiation foundation

President Trump laid the groundwork for the coming critical mineral diplomacy push during his October trip to attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in South Korea.

In the lead-up to the summit and his first face-to-face meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping since 2019, Trump secured [preliminary critical mineral supply agreements with Malaysia and Thailand](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/10/29/tech-metals/trump-secures-asian-critical-mineral-deals/2528.html), along with a [critical minerals and rare earths framework agreement with Japan](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/10/29/tech-metals/trump-takaichi-sign-critical-minerals-pact/2530.html).

The week prior, he inked an [$8.5 billion US-Australia Critical Minerals Framework agreement](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/10/22/tech-metals/us-australia-level-up-critical-minerals-pact/2522.html) with Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese.

Lutnick and Greer's six-month negotiating sprint builds on the broader U.S. strategy of [Forging Critical Minerals Alliances](https://www.metaltechnews.com/search/Forging_Critical_Minerals_Alliances); a theme Metal Tech News has been tracking in its annual [Critical Minerals Alliances ](https://www.metaltechnews.com/home/cms_data/dfault/photos/stories/id/0/4/2404/104932.pdf)magazine over the past five years.

The U.S. commerce secretary and trade representative are expected to expand beyond Asia-Pacific partners and pursue new deals in Africa, Europe, and the Middle East.

Saudi Arabia, in particular, is expected to be a key U.S. critical minerals partner. The Middle Eastern nation, which has pledged to invest nearly $1 trillion into the U.S. economy, entered into a U.S.-Saudi Critical Mineral Framework during a historic November visit to the White House by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

During that visit, the U.S. Department of War and domestic rare earths mining company MP Materials Corp. [unveiled a strategic joint venture](https://www.metaltechnews.com/story/2025/11/26/tech-metals/us-saudi-arabia-to-form-rare-earths-jv/2558.html) with Saudi Arabian Mining Company (Maaden) to develop a rare earth refinery in the Middle Eastern kingdom.

""By combining MP's technical expertise with the strategic vision of the U.S. Department of War and Maaden's capabilities and scale, the pieces are in place to fundamentally strengthen and diversify the supply chain,"" MP Materials Chairman and CEO James Litinsky said at the time.

This trilateral partnership may serve as a model for the types of PCMDP agreements Lutnick and Greer will pursue over the next six months.

President Trump is planning further measures to fill any critical mineral supply gaps that remain after the negotiating window closes.

""If negotiations fail to produce timely or satisfactory outcomes, the order explicitly contemplates the use of trade remedies – such as tariffs or other import restrictions – to protect U.S. national security,"" said Baskaran. ""The order also leaves open the possibility of additional measures in the future, including minimum import prices for certain critical minerals, depending on the results of negotiations.""

1qfbnih,https://www.reddit.com/r/psychesystems/comments/1qfbnih/the_psychology_of_being_highly_intelligent_8/,The Psychology of Being Highly Intelligent: 8 Science-Backed Struggles (And How to Deal),"So I've been down this rabbit hole for months. Books, podcasts, research papers, the whole
deal. Started because I kept noticing this pattern among my friends who are objectively smart,
like really smart. And they're miserable. Not in an edgy way, but genuinely struggling with stuff
that seems... counterintuitive?
Society sells us this idea that intelligence equals success equals happiness. But that's such
bullshit. High IQ correlates with higher rates of anxiety, existential dread, and social isolation.
There's actual research on this (just search ""intelligence and psychological wellbeing"" and
prepare to feel validated). The system isn't built for people who think differently. Biology plays a
role too. But here's the thing, these struggles are manageable once you understand what's
actually happening in your brain.


**1. Analysis paralysis is eating your life**

Your brain won't shut up. Every decision becomes this massive tree of possibilities and
outcomes. Ordering coffee? Your mind is already three steps ahead calculating which choice
optimizes caffeine intake vs taste vs cost vs perceived pretentiousness.
This is called rumination and it's exhausting. Psychologist Barry Schwartz wrote about this in
""The Paradox of Choice"". Basically, more options and deeper analysis don't lead to better
decisions. They lead to decision fatigue and regret. The book is a bit old but insanely relevant.
It'll make you question why you spend 40 minutes choosing a Netflix show.
Practical fix: Set decision timers. Seriously. Give yourself 30 seconds for small choices, 5
minutes for medium ones. Your first instinct is usually correct anyway. Another trick is the
10/10/10 rule from Suzy Welch. Will this matter in 10 minutes? 10 months? 10 years? Most
decisions fail the first test.


**2. You're intellectually lonely as hell**

Nobody gets your references. Your humor falls flat. Conversations feel shallow because people
aren't interested in dissecting the socioeconomic implications of whatever topic you're fixated
on. This isn't elitism, it's genuinely isolating when you can't connect with people on the level
your brain operates.
Research from Terman's longitudinal study of gifted individuals found that high IQ people often
report feeling ""different"" and struggle to find peers who match their intellectual intensity. It's a
real thing, not just you being dramatic.
Solution: Find your people online. Reddit communities, Discord servers, niche forums about whatever weird thing you're into. Also, learn to code switch. I know that sounds like dumbing
yourself down, but it's actually a skill. Match energy levels. Ask questions instead of lecturing.
Most people are smarter than they appear once you give them space to open up. The podcast
""Hidden Brain"" has great episodes on communication barriers and how to bridge them.


**3. You've realized nothing matters and it's breaking you**

Congratulations, you've thought yourself into existential dread. Once you understand that we're
on a floating rock in infinite space and all social constructs are arbitrary and meaning is self
created, life gets heavy. Really heavy.
This is basically the existential crisis that philosophers have been writing about forever. Check
out ""Man's Search for Meaning"" by Viktor Frankl if you haven't already. Frankl was a Holocaust
survivor and psychiatrist who argued that humans can endure almost anything if they have a
sense of purpose. This book is devastating but also weirdly hopeful. Best book on meaning I've
ever read, hands down.
The fix isn't finding THE answer because there isn't one. It's creating your own meaning through
action. Help people. Build something. Master a skill. Your brain needs a project bigger than
itself. Also consider therapy, specifically existential therapy or ACT (Acceptance and
Commitment Therapy). The Finch app is surprisingly good for building daily habits around
purpose and values if you want something less intense.


**4. Imposter syndrome hits different when you're actually competent**

You know you're smart. You've got the credentials, the results, whatever. But there's this voice that says everyone's about to figure out you're faking it. Weirdly, imposter syndrome affects high achievers MORE than average performers because you're acutely aware of how much you don't know.
Dr. Valerie Young's research breaks down five imposter syndrome types. Her book ""The Secret
Thoughts of Successful Women"" applies to everyone despite the title. She explains why capable people feel like frauds and gives concrete strategies to reframe that thinking.
Reality check: Everyone feels this way. That person you think has it figured out? They're faking confidence too. The difference is they've learned to act anyway. Keep a ""wins folder"" with
positive feedback, completed projects, anything that proves you're not actually bullshitting your
way through life. Review it when the imposter feelings hit.


**5. Your expectations are ruining everything**

You expect so much from yourself that anything less than perfect feels like failure. You expect
others to think as critically as you do and get disappointed when they don't. You expected life to make sense and it doesn't. These expectations are killing your happiness.
This ties into what psychologists call ""maladaptive perfectionism"". Dr. Brené Brown talks about this extensively in her work on vulnerability and shame. Her book ""The Gifts of Imperfection"" sounds cheesy but it genuinely helped me understand why I was setting myself up for constant disappointment. She argues that perfectionism isn't about achievement, it's about trying to earn approval. That hit hard.
Lower your expectations. Not your standards, your expectations. Expect people to be human
and flawed. Expect yourself to mess up sometimes. Expect life to be messy and confusing. This isn't pessimism, it's realism. And weirdly, it makes the good stuff feel better because you're not taking it for granted.


**6. You're bored out of your mind constantly**

Nothing holds your attention. You start projects and abandon them. Work feels tedious.
Conversations feel predictable. Your brain is literally understimulated and it's making you
restless and irritable.
Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi researched ""flow states"" for decades. His book ""Flow: The
Psychology of Optimal Experience"" explains why intelligent people get bored easily. your brain
needs the right balance of challenge and skill. Too easy and you're bored. Too hard and you're
anxious. Most of life sits in the ""too easy"" zone for people with high processing speeds.
Fix this by deliberately seeking challenges. Learn something completely outside your expertise.
Rock climbing, programming, pottery, whatever. The Brilliant app is actually solid for math and
science puzzles that'll make your brain work. Also, embrace depth over breadth. Instead of
surface level knowledge about everything, go obscenely deep into one topic. Become weird
about it. That's where the interesting stuff lives.
If structured learning helps, there's an AI-powered app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that pulls from psychology research, books like the ones mentioned here, and expert insights to create
personalized learning plans. Type in something specific like ""manage perfectionism as a high
achiever"" or ""find meaning beyond career success,"" and it generates audio content tailored to your depth preference, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples.
The adaptive plan adjusts based on what resonates with you, which is useful when your brain needs intellectual stimulation but you're too scattered to commit to a full book. Plus you can customize the voice, some people swear by the sarcastic narrator for making dense psychology concepts less tedious.


**7. You overthink relationships until they implode**

You're analyzing every text message. Reading subtext that might not exist. Predicting how
conversations will go before they happen. Your romantic partner says they're fine and you've
already constructed fifteen theories about what's actually wrong. This hyperawareness destroys
intimacy because you're never actually present.
Dr. John Gottman's research on relationships is the gold standard here. His book ""The Seven
Principles for Making Marriage Work"" is backed by actual data from studying thousands of
couples. One key finding is that ""bids for connection"" matter more than big gestures. Basically, respond when your partner tries to connect, even in small ways. Stop overthinking and start being present.
Also, communicate your thinking style. Tell people ""I tend to overanalyze, so if I'm reading too much into something, call me out"". Most conflicts come from unexpressed expectations and assumptions. The Ash app is genuinely helpful for relationship coaching if you want an AI therapist situation without the cost of a real one.


**8. You're aware of too many possibilities and it's paralyzing**

You see how your life could go a hundred different ways. Every choice eliminates other paths.
This awareness of opportunity cost makes committing to anything feel like failure. You're stuck because moving forward means accepting that other versions of your life won't happen.
This is called ""maximizing"" vs ""satisficing"". Maximizers try to make the optimal choice.
Satisficers choose something good enough and move on. Research consistently shows satisficers are happier. Not because they settle, but because they don't torture themselves over unrealized alternatives.
The book ""Algorithms to Live By"" by Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths applies computer science to life decisions. There's a whole chapter on the ""optimal stopping problem"" that explains when to stop gathering information and just commit. Turns out 37% is the magic number for many decisions. Explore 37% of your options then pick the next one that's better than all previous ones. This sounds ridiculous but it's mathematically sound and will stop you from endlessly deliberating.
Look, intelligence is a gift and a curse. You didn't ask for a brain that won't shut up. But you've
got it, so you might as well learn to work with it instead of against it. These struggles don't
disappear, but they become manageable once you stop seeing them as personal failures and
start treating them as features of how you're wired. Your brain isn't broken, it just needs different strategies than most people use.
Read the books, try the tools, find your people. And remember that being smart doesn't mean
having all the answers. Sometimes the most intelligent thing you can do is admit you don't know and figure it out as you go.",1,1768651832.0,psychesystems,0,1.0,False

1qfbi89,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1qfbi89/corpse_of_the_horse/,Corpse of the Horse,"The morning of March sixth was the moment my world got turned upside down. It was a Thursday morning, colder than usual, an inch or so of snow still avoiding its inevitable fate. I woke up groggy, with the only cure being a hot cup of coffee. As I walked into the kitchen, there it was. The rotting corpse of a horse. 



I was immediately shocked out of my daze. A horse? On my kitchen table? I circled the corpse. It was in a state of decay, its skin and flesh peeling off the bones. Its skull was fully exposed. Empty, dark circles that were once called eyes stared back at me, straight into my soul. 



I fumble around with the lock of my door as I rush out into the stairwell of my apartment, still in my pyjamas. I knocked on the door of my neighbour to no answer. Must've left for work already. As I reenter the room, the stench finally hits me. I gag as the warm scent of blood and rot make it to my nostrils. I made my way to every single one of the windows in my apartment and opened them. It is then that I finally decide to call the police.



I had some time to myself to think in the time before the cops arrived. One awful thought kept creeping into my mind. All my doors and windows were locked. How did it get in?



The officers finally arrived while I was waiting in the stairwell. I couldn't bare the smell, the sight, or the implications of that... thing. I went through all the details with them, signed some paperwork, and they were off, having called in some biowaste cleaners. It was more than nothing, but since they didn't see any sign of forced entry there wasn't a lot they could do.



I was left with the horse again. I couldn't leave home since I had to wait for the biowaste team, and I couldn't really sit in the cold stairwell all day. So, with a clothes pin on my nose, I went about my day as normally as I could. 



I tried to keep my gaze away from the rotting pile of meat and bones on my dinner table, I really did, but every time I passed by the horse to go to the bathroom or get some water, its lifeless stare would burn into the back of my skull.



An hour had passed with no sign of the biowaste team. Though it felt way longer. 



As I got up from my desk to take a leak, the absurdity of the situation finally set in. A fucking horse? And a dead one at that? Why? How? Why me?



I decided to do something. I couldn't just sit on my ass while the horse juices get absorbed by my imported walnut table. I was going to clean the horse up myself.



The soulless eyesockets of the horse stared at me relentlessly as I grabbed the serated knife from the kitchen counter. I was meaning to get a new one anyways. I started with the limbs. The knife when through the flesh and skin as if it was butter. The most disgusting butter known to man. The blade stopped up when I got to the bones, so I had to put some more elbow grease into it.



An hour or two had passed and there still was no sign of the clean up crew, but luckily I had done their job. I had put the body parts of the horse into garbage bags. I double layered them just to make sure. It took me another thirty minutes to carry all of them down to the garbage dunks. I took the head down last. Just so I could take one last look at its hollow eyes before saying goodbye forever. Call it morbid, but I'm just a sentimental person.



Once all the parts were successfully in the trash, I made my way up, hoping that I could get the stench out within the afternoon. Those plans were quickly thrown out, as the horse was back on the kitchen table, exactly as it was before. Well not exactly, the places where I had sawed through the limbs and neck had seemingly healed, to the point where it didn't look rotten at all.



I couldn't take it anymore. All the hours and effort I had put in to getting rid of this pile of rotten bones, just for it to find its way back into my life. As its mocking black voids stared at me, rage filled my body.



I punched it.



I punched the corpse right between its eyes. And then again. And then again.



Blood and gore were spraying onto my beautiful baby blue walls and kitchen cabinets. Skull fragments dug into my knuckles as I kept the punches coming. My white shirt quickly turned to a deep crimson.



The corpse was just a pile of goop by the time I was interrupted by a knock on the door. 



Covered in blood and brains, I open the door.



""Hi?"" I asked sheepishly.



""Bio-waste management, we were told about your horse problem, can I come in?"" The towering man asked firmly, not even looking up from his clipboard



""No."" my answer came out more firm than intended.



He looked up from his clipboard now with a puzzled face, which quickly turned to horror as he saw me.



""Leave."" I continued with my new found moxie as I attempted to slam the door in his face, which his foot blocked.



""Son, I'm here to help, what happened.""



""I said leave!"" I shouted while kicking his foot out of the way and locking the door.



With my heart pounding in my throat, I returned to the depths of my apartment. I could not let them see what I had done, they'd think I was a psychopath! However, I had more pressing matters to attend to.



In my kitchen stood the horse. And not the pile of flesh and gore, not the corpse, no, he was as healthy as, well, a horse.



For just a moment, we stood there, those black voids replaced by pools of crimson as the sun hit the eyes of the beast. We stared at eachother. For just a moment. A calm before the storm. And then, the moment ended.



The beast charged at me, full speed. I dodged it with not even a millisecond to spare. I fell to the floor as the horse rammed into the wall, creating a dent and making all my beautiful artworks on the wall fall.



The horse recovered quicker than me and stood above me. His eyes were not empty and soulless anymore. No, no it was filled with rage and vengeance. As it jumped on its hind legs in preparation to slam its hooves through my heart, I was able to roll out of the way and hop up on my feet. 



I rushed into my bedroom, locking the door and barricading it behind me. I only had two options, and I had to decide quick, as horsey was already ramming into the door trying to break it down. Do I face the horse, or do I risk surviving a fall from the fourth floor. It was a clear choice.



I opened the window and looked down. I could probably aim for the trees down by the street. If I don't get impaled by a branch, It'd probably cushion my fall where I'd get away with minor injuries. No time to think, as the door was slammed open, my barricade did nothing to hinder the stallion.



I took my leap of faith. It only lasted a second, but it could've been hours. I turned around mid air to glance back at the window, and I saw the horse just staring at me before disappearing back into my apartment.



Luckily, I got away with minor injuries. I stayed with my parents for the next couple of months after the incident. I could not tell them what happened exactly, so I just told them that I needed time away from the city, which was true, nothing better than the fresh countryside air.



I'm still traumatised by what happened on the Sixth of March. I still get freaked out when I see a horse over by the neighbouring ranch. And sometimes, I swear to God, that every now and then, in the middle of the night when even the crickets had gone to sleep, I can hear faint hoofbeats, growing ever louder.",2,1768651362.0,TalesFromTheCreeps,1,1.0,False

Started feeling hungry a couple of hours after my fast began. It happened when I was trying to eat to the “right” amount of fullness. If you have seen my previous post, you’ll know that I was feeling uncomfortably full after my last meal of the eating window. (Being autistic, I have trouble feeling the hunger and satiety cues most people have! I’ve often gone for long stretches of the day without hydrating or eating, and have suddenly felt on the verge of total collapse. And when I eat, it takes longer for the fullness to appear than it does for most people, I think. That’s why I get uncomfortably full.) 

Had difficulty falling asleep about a week and a half into my IF journey because of this feeling that I needed to eat — even though I’m on a medication that causes me to feel drowsy about half an hour after I take it (so I obviously take that one at night)! 

This issue persisted for a couple of nights. 

On the third night, in desperation, I decided to eat before going to bed. I got to sleep without any problem and woke up feeling refreshed. But I felt hungry at my usual eating window starting time — which was now only about 11 hours after I’d begun my fast. I thought, well, I’ve just got to eat something now. 

For the past two days, I have paused my IF journey. I deleted Fasty from my phone, too. 

Last night, I ate quite late — about 9.30 pm — and went to bed at about 11. I slept through until about 9.30 this morning. I’m not a long sleeper at all — usually 6 hours is my limit! — so to sleep for this long is rare. 

I decided that I’d resume fasting today, or more accurately, I realized that I’d actually resumed it last night. It suddenly occurred to me, in my now state of clarity, that I’d been exhausted for the last week or so, resuming work after Christmas, and I was still recovering from the cold that I’d had at the beginning of the year. It also became apparent that I need to eat fairly soon before bedtime. Looking back over the decades, it’s obvious that I’ve always had a reduced appetite during the day but a need to “fill up” in the evening. It’s just built-in, I think. One of my daughters is the same. (Fortunately, she does have hunger and satiety cues!) 

My new fasting schedule is going to be a mixture of 16:8s and 18:6s that start at 2100–2130 every night. It makes perfect sense. My working day begins very early, so it means I’ll be on water and black coffee throughout my working hours. That’s easy enough, though, because I work from home. 

I’ve only had black coffee since waking today. I’m not yet hungry. I’ll eat when I feel I need to eat. 

It starts again today, in earnest. ",1,1768651103.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

The person I am now is not the boy I was then. And with the permanent weight of your loss, I have to say this: if I could go back, knowing this pain, knowing this ending, I would have left you alone. I would never have approached you. I would give up every good memory to know you had a long life, even one without me in it.

You were the perfect woman. But we were a perfect mistake. Our time together feels like it happened in the wrong lifetime, or in the cruelest possible chapter of this one.

After you died, I lost myself. I chased perfection like it was a shield. I thought if I could just correct every flaw I’d had with you, I could build a life safe from that kind of loss. Everyone I met after you became a project; a chance to fix a mistake I’d made with a ghost. I lived by an algorithm built from your memory: your favorite color, how you took your coffee, the way you’d get quiet when you were hurt. I became a hollow man following a script.

People can tell when you’re not really there. They treat you like something to use. I bought someone lavender once, just because. She gave me a fifteen-minute lecture on why roses were the only correct choice. I never bought flowers again. I overheard an ex on the phone saying I needed to be “trained.” It was the universe’s brutal way of telling me I was on the wrong path.

So I walked away from all of it. I corrected every mistake I ever made with you. I’m not messy anymore. I’m orderly. I got degrees. I built a clean, quiet life. But you weren’t here to see it. And in correcting my past for you, I just made colder, stranger mistakes with living people. The universe sent chaos my way to laugh at my sterile walls.

The only real mistake I made after your death was trying to replace you. Looking for that specific warmth elsewhere just left me frozen. My world was color when you were in it.

After ending up in 53 different beds before losing count, I finally made peace with you being gone, and not trying to replace you. Ironically, when I stopped searching for you, I found someone like you. but I'll do the right thing this time. I will see her for who she is, and not a project for your replacement. I think of all the mistakes and corrections I've made in my life, you'd be happy of this one.",2,1768651064.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

It's actual science from behavioral psychology, evolutionary biology, and neuroscience research.

Most of us think attraction is this mysterious thing we can't control. But honestly? A huge chunk of it comes down to psychological triggers we can actually understand and work with. The problem isn't you, it's just that nobody teaches us how human psychology actually operates in social situations.

The Halo Effect is probably the most powerful one. When someone has one positive trait, we automatically assume they have other positive qualities too. It's why that person who dresses well at work also gets perceived as more competent. Social psychologist Dr. Richard Wiseman talks about this extensively in his research. The fix is simple but takes effort. Excel visibly in one area, whether that's fitness, style, or a skill, and people will unconsciously attribute other positive traits to you.

The Pratfall Effect is counterintuitive as hell. Small, harmless mistakes actually make you MORE likable if you're already perceived as competent. Perfect people are intimidating. Someone who's accomplished but occasionally spills coffee or tells a self deprecating story becomes approachable. Psychologist Elliot Aronson proved this in his famous experiment where a competent person who spilled coffee was rated more attractive than one who didn't. But this only works if you've established competence first. Otherwise you're just clumsy.

Mere Exposure Effect explains why that coworker you barely noticed becomes attractive over time. The more we see someone, the more we like them, assuming interactions are neutral or positive. It's pure repetition. This is huge for building attraction gradually. Show up consistently in someone's life without being pushy. Join the same gym class, frequent the same coffee shop, engage regularly on group chats. Familiarity breeds comfort, comfort breeds trust, trust breeds attraction.

There's also Reciprocal Liking, where we're attracted to people who are attracted to us. Sounds obvious but most people hide their interest too much. Subtle signs you're interested, genuine compliments, remembering small details about them, these signal that you like them and trigger reciprocal feelings. Just don't overdo it into desperation territory.

The Pygmalion Effect is wild. When you believe someone will succeed or has certain qualities, they often live up to those expectations. Treat someone like they're fascinating, intelligent, and worthy of attention, and they'll often become more of those things around you. Meanwhile, you become the person who brings that out in them. It's magnetic.

Here's where it gets really interesting. Misattribution of Arousal means people confuse physiological excitement from one source like a scary movie, intense workout, or adrenaline rush with attraction. Studies by psychologists Dutton and Aron showed people were more attracted to someone they met on a scary bridge versus a stable one. The heart racing from fear got misattributed as romantic interest. Do exciting activities together. Skip the boring dinner, go rock climbing or to a concert instead.

The Scarcity Principle makes things, including people, more desirable when they seem rare or hard to get. This doesn't mean play games, but it means maintain your own life, interests, and friendships. Being genuinely busy with meaningful pursuits makes you scarcer and thus more valuable in others' eyes. Nobody wants someone with nothing going on.

Similarity Attraction is basic but powerful. We're drawn to people who share our values, interests, and backgrounds. But there's a twist, Complementarity matters too for specific traits. Someone organized pairs well with someone spontaneous. The key is matching core values while complementing behavioral traits. Find common ground early, shared music taste, similar humor, mutual goals, then let your different strengths balance each other out.

The book Influence by Robert Cialdini is insanely good for understanding these psychological principles. He's a professor emeritus at Arizona State and his research on persuasion is foundational. The book breaks down six principles of influence including scarcity, social proof, and reciprocity in a way that completely changed how I see human behavior. Reading it felt like getting a manual for social interaction that everyone should have received at birth.

Social Proof means we find people attractive when others validate that attraction. It's why someone in a relationship often seems more desirable, they've been pre selected. Cultivate genuine friendships, have people around you who clearly enjoy your company, and new people will subconsciously perceive you as more valuable. It's tribal psychology still operating in modern dating.

The Peak End Rule explains that people judge experiences by their peak moment and ending, not the average. Make interactions memorable with high points and always end on a strong note. Leave them wanting more rather than dragging things out until they fizzle. That last impression carries disproportionate weight.

Emotional Contagion is the phenomenon where we catch feelings from others like a virus. Be genuinely enthusiastic, optimistic, and energized, and people will feel that way around you. Nobody remembers what you said exactly but they remember how you made them feel. Psychologist Dr. Sigal Barsade studied this at Wharton and found that positive emotional contagion significantly improved group dynamics and interpersonal attraction.

The Ben Franklin Effect is bizarre but proven. When someone does YOU a favor, they like you more afterward, not less. Asking for small favors makes people invest in you and justify that investment by deciding they must like you. Obviously don't exploit this, but don't be afraid to ask for help or opinions occasionally.

Novelty and Dopamine are linked in the brain's reward system. New experiences trigger dopamine release, which gets associated with whoever you're with. Be the person who introduces others to new music, restaurants, ideas, or activities. You become linked with that excitement and reward in their mind. Neuroscientist Dr. Helen Fisher researches this extensively in her work on love and attraction.

The Contrast Effect means you look better when compared to a worse alternative. This isn't about bringing ugly friends out, it's about positioning. If you're the most socially skilled person in a group interaction, the most well spoken person in a meeting, or the most considerate person someone's dated recently, contrast works in your favor. Focus on genuinely developing skills that make you stand out.

Reciprocity of Vulnerability builds deep attraction fast. When you share something personal and they reciprocate, intimacy accelerates. Dr. Arthur Aron's famous 36 questions study showed that structured mutual vulnerability could create closeness between strangers in under an hour. Don't trauma dump, but gradually sharing fears, dreams, and insecurities invites others to do the same and creates powerful bonding.

The podcast The Art of Charm does incredible deep dives into social dynamics and attraction psychology. The hosts interview everyone from psychologists to dating coaches to charisma experts. One episode with behavioral economist Dan Ariely completely shifted how I think about irrational decision making in relationships. They break down complex concepts into practical strategies without the typical pickup artist garbage.

If you want a more structured way to actually apply all this, there's an AI learning app called BeFreed that pulls from relationship psychology books, research papers, and expert insights to create personalized learning plans. You can set a specific goal like ""become more magnetic as an introvert"" and it generates a tailored roadmap with audio lessons you can adjust from quick 10-minute summaries to deeper 40-minute dives. The content covers everything from attachment theory to social dynamics, and you can customize the voice to whatever keeps you engaged, whether that's something calm or more energetic. It also has a virtual coach you can chat with about specific situations or questions as they come up. Helpful if you're serious about internalizing this stuff beyond just reading about it once.

Physical Proximity is simple but underrated. We're more likely to be attracted to people we're physically near regularly. It combines with mere exposure. If you want to build attraction with someone, find legitimate reasons to be in their physical space more often. Work on projects together, suggest carpooling, position yourself near them in group settings.

The Chameleon Effect means we unconsciously mimic people we like, and we like people who subtly mirror us. Match their energy level, speaking pace, and body language naturally, not creepily. It creates subconscious rapport. Psychologist Tanya Chartrand found that subtle mimicry increased liking and perceived smoothness of interaction.

Autonomy and Competence are basic psychological needs according to Self Determination Theory. People are attracted to those who demonstrate these qualities. Show you can handle your life independently and that you're good at something, anything really. Helplessness and incompetence outside of endearing moments are attraction killers.

The Zeigarnik Effect means we remember incomplete tasks better than completed ones. In attraction terms, leaving some mystery and not revealing everything about yourself immediately keeps you on their mind. They'll think about you more trying to fill in the gaps. Don't be an open book in the first few interactions

Positive Associations matter enormously. If every interaction with you is fun, interesting, or makes them feel good, they'll associate YOU with those positive feelings. Conversely, if you're always complaining or bringing heavy energy, you become linked with negativity. Be mindful of the emotional wake you leave.

Understanding Attachment Styles from the book Attached by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller is legitimately game changing. It's based on decades of psychological research into how our early relationships shape our adult attachment patterns, anxious, avoidant, or secure. The book explains why you're attracted to certain people, why relationships follow certain patterns, and how to develop more secure attachment. It's not just theory, it has practical advice for recognizing patterns and choosing compatible partners. This is probably the best relationship psychology book I've encountered.

Status and Prestige trigger attraction through evolutionary psychology. We're wired to notice social hierarchy. This doesn't mean be a jerk or obsess over status symbols, but developing genuine expertise, taking leadership roles, and being respected in your community are all attractive. Social psychologist Dr. Cameron Anderson studies status and found that generous high status individuals are most attractive because they signal resources AND willingness to share.

Humor and Playfulness signal intelligence, creativity, and low stress levels, all attractive traits. But it's not about being a clown, it's about not taking everything deadly seriously and being able to laugh especially at yourself. Evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller argues that humor evolved as a fitness indicator, like a peacock's tail for the mind.

The last one, Consistency and Reliability, might sound boring but it's foundational. All the psychological tricks in the world don't matter if you're flaky, dishonest, or unpredictable in bad ways. Being someone whose words match their actions, who shows up when they say they will, who follows through, that builds trust. And sustained attraction is impossible without trust.

These aren't manipulation tactics, they're insights into how human psychology operates. Understanding them helps you show up as your most attractive self while also recognizing what's actually happening in your own attraction responses. You're not rewiring yourself into someone else, you're just optimizing how you present the good qualities you already have.",1,1768651052.0,MindfullyDriven,0,1.0,False
1qfbe6r,https://www.reddit.com/r/VPNforFreedom/comments/1qfbe6r/how_to_watch_stacktv_from_anywhere/,How to Watch StackTV from Anywhere,"Traveling outside Canada and can't catch the latest *Survivor* episode? Tried loading StackTV only to hit a geo-block wall? I've been there. That frustration when you just want to watch your shows but the internet decides you're in the wrong country—it's annoying as hell.

The good news? You can watch StackTV from literally anywhere with the right setup. I've tested this from three different continents, and the solution works every single time.

✅ **Quick Answer:** To watch StackTV outside Canada, you need a VPN with Canadian servers. Connect to a Toronto, Montreal, or Vancouver server, and StackTV thinks you're back home. The entire process takes about 5 minutes. NordVPN is the fastest option I've tested—it unblocks StackTV reliably and maintains smooth HD streaming.

# What Is StackTV and Why Can't You Access It?

StackTV is Corus Entertainment's streaming package that bundles 16 Canadian networks into one subscription. You get Global, Food Network Canada, HGTV Canada, W Network, History, Showcase, and more—all live and on-demand.

The problem? StackTV is locked to Canada only.

When you try accessing from the US, UK, or anywhere else, their system checks your IP address. If it's not Canadian, you're blocked. Simple as that. This isn't StackTV being difficult—it's licensing restrictions. The content rights they hold only cover Canadian viewers, so they're legally required to enforce these geo-blocks.

**Where StackTV is Available:**

* Amazon Prime Video Channels (requires Prime membership)
* Rogers Xfinity TV and Streaming
* Fubo Canada
* Bell Fibe TV app

All of these platforms check your location before letting you watch. Try accessing any of them from outside Canada and you'll get the same frustrating error message.

# The Simple Solution: Use a VPN to Get a Canadian IP

Here's how this works. A VPN (Virtual Private Network) routes your internet connection through a server in another country. When you connect to a Canadian VPN server, websites see a Canadian IP address instead of your real one.

To StackTV's system, you look like a Canadian viewer. The geo-block disappears.

I've used this method to watch StackTV from the US, Europe, and even Australia. Works flawlessly every time—as long as you're using a capable VPN. Not all VPNs have Canadian servers, and not all Canadian servers are fast enough for HD streaming.

💡 **Pro Tip:** Choose a VPN with multiple server locations in Canada. If one server is slow or gets detected, you can instantly switch to another. NordVPN has 480+ servers across Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver—plenty of backup options.

# Step-by-Step: How to Unblock StackTV from Anywhere

Let me walk you through the exact process I use.

# Step 1: Choose a VPN with Strong Canadian Coverage

You need a VPN that offers:

* Multiple servers in Canada (for speed and reliability)
* Fast enough speeds for HD/4K streaming
* Strong encryption to hide your VPN usage
* Apps for all your devices

**My top recommendation is NordVPN.** I've tested it extensively for Canadian streaming, and it consistently delivers smooth performance on StackTV. The speeds are excellent—I regularly stream in HD without buffering—and their Canadian server network is massive.

If you're budget-conscious, Surfshark is a solid alternative. It's cheaper and offers unlimited device connections, though it has fewer Canadian servers (120 vs NordVPN's 480+).

# Step 2: Install the VPN App

After subscribing to your chosen VPN:

1. Download the app from the official website or your device's app store
2. Install it on your streaming device (phone, tablet, laptop, smart TV, etc.)
3. Log in with your account credentials

This takes about 2 minutes. The apps are designed to be dead simple—you don't need technical knowledge.

# Step 3: Connect to a Canadian Server

Open the VPN app and select a server in Canada. Most VPNs let you choose between cities:

* **Toronto** – Usually the fastest option with the most servers
* **Montreal** – Good speeds, especially for eastern US users
* **Vancouver** – Best for west coast connections

Click connect. Wait 5-10 seconds for the VPN to establish a secure tunnel. You'll see a notification when you're connected.

# Step 4: Access StackTV Through Your Preferred Platform

**If you're using Amazon Prime Video:**

1. Go to primevideo.com (or open the Prime Video app)
2. Navigate to the ""Channels"" section
3. Search for ""StackTV""
4. Subscribe if you haven't already ($14.99/month)
5. Start streaming

**If you're using another platform:**

* **Fubo:** Open the Fubo app/website and navigate to StackTV channels
* **Bell Fibe TV app:** Log into the app and add StackTV ($10/month)
* **Rogers Xfinity:** Access StackTV through your Rogers subscription

The VPN connection makes these platforms think you're in Canada, so they load normally without any geo-restriction errors.

⚠️ **Warning:** If you see a geo-block message even with your VPN connected, your browser might have cached your old location. Clear your cookies and cache, then reload the page. On mobile apps, force-close the app and restart it with the VPN already connected.

# Step 5: Enjoy Your Shows

That's it. You're now streaming StackTV as if you never left Canada.

I usually leave the VPN connected while I'm watching—no need to disconnect between episodes. When you're done streaming, you can disconnect the VPN or leave it on for general browsing (which I recommend for privacy).

# Best VPNs for Watching StackTV in 2025

I've tested seven different VPNs for StackTV access. These three consistently deliver the best results.

# 1. NordVPN – Best Overall for StackTV

NordVPN is my go-to for Canadian streaming. Period.

**What makes it great:**

* 480+ servers across 3 Canadian cities
* NordLynx protocol delivers blazing speeds (I average 200+ Mbps)
* SmartPlay technology handles geo-unblocking automatically
* Works with StackTV, Crave, CBC Gem, and all Canadian platforms
* 30-day money-back guarantee

**Canadian Server Locations:**

* Toronto (largest concentration of servers)
* Montreal
* Vancouver

In my speed tests, NordVPN maintained 85-90% of my base internet speed when connected to Toronto servers. That's excellent—plenty for 4K streaming without buffering.

The SmartPlay feature is particularly useful for StackTV. It automatically routes your traffic through the right servers to bypass geo-blocks, so you don't have to manually configure anything.

**Pricing:** Starts at $3.39/month for the 2-year plan. More expensive than budget options, but the performance justifies the cost if you're serious about streaming quality.

# 2. Surfshark – Best Budget Option with Unlimited Connections

Surfshark is the wallet-friendly choice that doesn't sacrifice much performance.

**What I like:**

* 120+ servers in Canada (Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver)
* Unlimited simultaneous device connections (huge if you have multiple devices or want to share with family)
* Nexus technology stabilizes speeds across the entire network
* Works with StackTV, Netflix Canada, and other Canadian platforms
* 30-day money-back guarantee

**Speed Performance:** In testing, Surfshark delivered 170-180 Mbps on Canadian servers (my base speed is 200 Mbps). Slightly slower than NordVPN but still more than adequate for HD streaming.

The unlimited connections are the real selling point. You can secure your phone, laptop, tablet, smart TV, and your partner's devices—all at the same time on one subscription.

**Pricing:** Starts at $1.99/month for the 2-year plan. Can't beat that value, especially with unlimited devices.

# 3. ExpressVPN – Premium Speed and Reliability

ExpressVPN is the premium option. It costs more, but the performance is top-tier.

**Standout features:**

* Servers in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver
* Lightway protocol for maximum speed (consistently 220+ Mbps in my tests)
* Works with every Canadian streaming platform I've tested
* 10 simultaneous connections
* 30-day money-back guarantee

ExpressVPN rarely gets detected by streaming platforms. In months of testing, I've never had it fail on StackTV. That reliability comes at a price—it's the most expensive option on this list.

**Pricing:** Around $6.67/month for the annual plan. Ouch. But if you absolutely need the fastest speeds and most reliable access, it's worth considering.

🎯 **Bottom Line:** If you want the best balance of speed, reliability, and value, go with NordVPN. Budget-conscious users should choose Surfshark. If money's no object and you want absolute top performance, ExpressVPN won't disappoint.

# VPN Comparison for StackTV Streaming

# How to Subscribe to StackTV (Platform Options)

Once you have your VPN connected to a Canadian server, you can subscribe to StackTV through multiple platforms. Here's the breakdown.

# Amazon Prime Video (Most Popular Method)

**Requirements:**

* Amazon Prime membership ($9.99/month CAD)
* Canadian payment method or valid credit card

**Pricing:**

* StackTV channel: $14.99/month
* Total cost: \~$25/month (Prime + StackTV)

**How to Subscribe:**

1. Connect your VPN to a Canadian server
2. Go to primevideo.com
3. Navigate to Prime Video Channels
4. Search ""StackTV"" and click Subscribe
5. Confirm your subscription

💰 **Money-Saving Tip:** Amazon occasionally offers bundles. The Hayu + StackTV + Prime bundle costs $14.99/month total, saving you about 25% if you want both services.

# Bell Fibe TV App

**Requirements:**

* Bell Fibe TV app subscription
* Canadian billing address

**Pricing:**

* StackTV add-on: $10/month
* Requires existing Bell Fibe TV subscription

This is the cheapest StackTV option if you already have Bell service. However, getting a Bell Fibe TV subscription from outside Canada is difficult—you typically need a Canadian address and payment method.

# Rogers Xfinity TV/Streaming

**Requirements:**

* Rogers Xfinity TV or Xfinity Streaming subscription
* Available in Ontario and Atlantic Canada only

**Pricing:**

* StackTV add-on: Varies by package
* Often includes first month free for new subscribers

Similar to Bell, this requires an existing Rogers subscription, which is tough to obtain from outside Canada.

# Fubo Canada

**Requirements:**

* Fubo subscription
* Canadian payment method

**Pricing:**

* StackTV included in Fubo Premium or Entertainment plans
* Total cost depends on Fubo package chosen

Fubo is a good option if you want live sports alongside StackTV channels.

# StackTV Pricing Comparison

|Platform|StackTV Cost|Additional Requirements|Total Monthly Cost|Best For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Amazon Prime**|$14.99|Prime membership ($9.99)|\~$25|Most flexible, easiest to set up|
|**Bell Fibe TV**|$10|Bell subscription|Varies|Cheapest if you have Bell|
|**Rogers Xfinity**|Varies|Rogers subscription|Varies|Ontario/Atlantic residents|
|**Fubo**|Included|Fubo plan|Varies|Sports fans|

For most people outside Canada, Amazon Prime is the simplest route. The subscription process works with international credit cards (as long as your VPN is connected), and you don't need a Canadian address.

# Troubleshooting Common StackTV Access Issues

Even with a VPN, you might run into occasional problems. Here's how to fix the most common issues.

# Problem: StackTV Still Says You're Outside Canada

**Possible Causes:**

* Your VPN disconnected without you noticing
* The streaming app is using cached location data
* You're leaking your real IP address

**Solutions:**

1. Check that your VPN is actually connected (look for the VPN icon in your system tray)
2. Disconnect and reconnect to a different Canadian server
3. Clear your browser cache and cookies, then reload StackTV
4. On mobile apps, force-close the app and restart with VPN already running
5. Test for IP leaks at ipleak.net—if your real location shows, your VPN isn't working properly

# Problem: Buffering or Slow Streaming

**Possible Causes:**

* VPN server is overloaded
* You're connected to a distant server
* Your base internet speed is too slow

**Solutions:**

1. Switch to a different Canadian server (Toronto servers are usually fastest)
2. Use a wired connection instead of WiFi if possible
3. Close other bandwidth-heavy apps (downloads, video calls, etc.)
4. Try a different VPN protocol—NordVPN's NordLynx is fastest, but OpenVPN works if NordLynx has issues
5. Check your internet speed without VPN—you need at least 25 Mbps for HD streaming

⚡ **Performance Insight:** In my testing, Toronto servers consistently delivered the fastest speeds during peak evening hours. Montreal and Vancouver servers are good alternatives if Toronto is congested.

# Problem: Amazon Prime Won't Let You Subscribe

**Possible Causes:**

* Your payment method isn't accepted
* Amazon detected your VPN and blocked the transaction
* You're using a Prime account registered in a different country

**Solutions:**

1. Make sure your VPN is connected before attempting to subscribe
2. Use a credit card that works internationally (Visa and Mastercard are safest)
3. Try a different Canadian server if the first one gets blocked
4. Clear cookies and use an incognito/private browsing window
5. Create a new Amazon account while connected to the VPN (use a Canadian postal code if asked)

# Problem: The VPN Keeps Disconnecting

**Possible Causes:**

* Unstable internet connection
* VPN server is having issues
* Your firewall is interfering

**Solutions:**

1. Enable the kill switch in your VPN settings (this pauses internet if VPN drops)
2. Switch to a more stable VPN protocol (OpenVPN TCP is slower but more stable than UDP)
3. Check if your router firmware needs updating
4. Try connecting to a different Canadian city server
5. Restart your router and device

🔒 **Security Note:** Always enable your VPN's kill switch feature. If your VPN connection drops while streaming, the kill switch immediately blocks your internet to prevent your real location from leaking. Both NordVPN and Surfshark have reliable kill switches that work automatically.

# Is Using a VPN to Watch StackTV Legal?

Short answer: Yes, using a VPN is legal in Canada, the US, and most countries worldwide.

VPNs are legitimate privacy tools. Millions of people use them daily for security, remote work, and accessing content. There's nothing illegal about encrypting your internet connection or changing your virtual location.

**However, there's a nuance:**

While using a VPN isn't illegal, it might violate StackTV's or Amazon Prime's terms of service. Their user agreements typically state that you should only access content from regions where you're physically located.

Do they actively enforce this? Not really. I've never heard of anyone getting their account banned for using a VPN to watch StackTV. Streaming platforms care more about preventing account sharing and piracy than geo-unblocking.

**The practical reality:** Thousands of Canadians living abroad use VPNs to watch StackTV. It's become the standard solution. As long as you're paying for a legitimate subscription (not using someone else's account), you're supporting the content creators and networks.

**What about copyright?** You're not pirating anything—you're watching content you paid to access. The only issue is that you're watching from outside the licensed region. This is a licensing technicality, not a legal violation.

💡 **Pro Tip:** If you're concerned, stick to premium VPNs with strong privacy policies. NordVPN, Surfshark, and ExpressVPN don't keep logs of your activity, so there's no record of what you're watching or where you're actually located.

# FAQ: Your StackTV Questions Answered

**Can I watch StackTV for free?**

No. StackTV requires a paid subscription through Amazon Prime Video ($14.99/month), Bell Fibe TV ($10/month), Rogers Xfinity, or Fubo. Occasionally they offer promotional trials (like $0.99 for two months), but there's no permanent free option.

You'll also need a VPN to access it from outside Canada, which adds \~$2-5/month depending on which VPN you choose.

**Will free VPNs work with StackTV?**

Technically possible, but I don't recommend it. Free VPNs have serious limitations:

* Very few Canadian servers (if any)
* Extremely slow speeds that make streaming unbearable
* Data caps that'll run out after watching a single episode
* Weak security that can leak your real location
* Some inject ads or sell your browsing data

Free VPNs also get blocked more easily. StackTV and Amazon Prime actively blacklist known free VPN IP addresses.

If you're on a tight budget, Surfshark costs $1.99/month and actually works. That's less than a coffee. Free VPNs will frustrate you and waste your time.

**Which Canadian city server should I use?**

**Toronto** is usually your best bet. It has the most servers, which means less congestion and faster speeds. I use Toronto servers 90% of the time.

**Montreal** is a good alternative, especially if you're on the US East Coast. Geographic proximity can improve latency.

**Vancouver** works well for US West Coast users, though it has fewer servers than Toronto.

Try all three and see which gives you the best speed. It varies depending on your location and time of day.

**Can I watch StackTV on my smart TV?**

Yes. Most smart TVs support VPN apps or allow workarounds:

**Samsung/LG/Android TV:** Install the VPN app directly from your TV's app store (NordVPN and Surfshark both have Android TV apps)

**Apple TV:** Configure the VPN on your router, or use the tvOS app if available

**Roku/Fire TV Stick:** Install the VPN app from the device's app store

**Other Smart TVs:** Set up the VPN on your router to protect all devices on your network

The router method is most versatile—it covers every device in your home, including TVs, game consoles, and streaming devices that don't support VPN apps.

**Does NordVPN work with other Canadian streaming services?**

Absolutely. I've tested NordVPN with:

* **Crave** – Works perfectly (Crave is notoriously strict, so this is impressive)
* **CBC Gem** – No issues
* **CTV** – Unblocks reliably
* **TSN** – Streams without problems
* **Netflix Canada** – Access Canadian catalog from anywhere

If you're a Canadian expat or frequent traveler, NordVPN gives you access to pretty much all Canadian content, not just StackTV.

**Can multiple people use the same VPN account?**

Yes, but it depends on the VPN's connection limit:

* **NordVPN:** 10 simultaneous connections
* **Surfshark:** Unlimited connections (best for families)
* **ExpressVPN:** 10 simultaneous connections

You can share one VPN subscription across all your devices plus your family's devices. Surfshark is the obvious choice if you want to split the cost with roommates or family—literally unlimited devices on one account.

**How much data does streaming StackTV use?**

**Standard Definition (SD):** \~1 GB per hour **High Definition (HD):** \~3 GB per hour **4K/Ultra HD:** \~7 GB per hour

VPNs don't add any data overhead beyond a tiny amount for encryption headers (negligible). Your data usage with a VPN will be essentially the same as without one.

If you're on a capped data plan, be mindful of your streaming quality settings. Most VPNs offer unlimited bandwidth, so the VPN itself won't limit you.

# Final Thoughts: Get Back to Watching Your Shows

Look, geo-restrictions are annoying. I get it. You're paying for content, and some arbitrary geographic line shouldn't prevent you from watching it.

The good news is that bypassing StackTV's location blocks takes about five minutes with the right VPN. Connect to a Canadian server, load up StackTV, and you're back to watching *Survivor*, *Below Deck*, or whatever guilty pleasure you're currently binging.

I've been using this method for years—across multiple countries, multiple VPNs, and multiple devices. It just works. The technology is solid, the setup is simple, and the performance is smooth.

If you're serious about reliable StackTV access from anywhere, **invest in a quality VPN**. NordVPN is my top recommendation for the speed, server coverage, and consistent unblocking ability. If budget is tight, Surfshark delivers excellent value.

Both offer 30-day money-back guarantees, so you can test them risk-free. Connect to a Canadian server tonight and see for yourself how simple it is.

1qfbctd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfbctd,Which living room layout would work best?,"I'm moving into a new apartment and trying to determine what's the best layout for the furniture that I have. I'm also getting a (knockoff) eames lounge chair and want to make sure that it fits the space. All the other furniture is stuff I already have (e.g. the sectional with chaise right hand facing)

First, pls ignore the specific dimension numbers. The scale is mostly correct though.

About the text I added to the 1st layout, it would be the same for the 2nd layout, except I'd probably place the shelf (if I get one) on the opposite wall. Pic 3 shows some of the furniture I already have (from my old apartment), e.g. couch, coffee table, tv stand, Rocco fridge, plants. Pics 4-5 are staged examples of the new apartment to get a better idea of the new layout.

I'm currently leaning toward the 2nd layout for several reasons:

\- the lounge chair would be a statement piece and clearly visible as you enter the room.

\- in layout 1 the lounge chair seems like it would be in a high traffic area, a little too close to the dining table. Could be problematic especially cause it swivels?

\- the TV would be more visible from the kitchen

\- overall it feels like there'd be more usable space towards the front of the couch

Hoping to get some other perspectives to help with my decision, thank you. Also open to any other suggestions you have regarding furniture placement!",1,1768650898.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1qfbcpr,https://archive.ph/6K7R9,‘ELITE’: The Palantir App ICE Uses to Find Neighborhoods to Raid,"Palantir is working on a tool for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) that populates a map with potential deportation targets, brings up a dossier on each person, and provides a “confidence score” on the person’s current address, 404 Media has learned. ICE is using it to find locations where lots of people it might detain could be based. 

The findings, based on internal ICE material obtained by 404 Media, public procurement records, and recent sworn testimony from an ICE official, show the clearest link yet between the technological infrastructure Palantir is building for ICE and the agency’s activities on the ground. The tool receives peoples’ addresses from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) among a range of other sources, according to the material.

The news comes after Department of Homeland Security (DHS) head Kristi Noem said the agency is sending hundreds more federal agents to Minneapolis amid widespread protests against the agency. Last week ICE officer Jonathan Ross shot and killed 37 year old U.S. citizen Renee Nicole Good. During Operation Metro Surge, which DHS calls the “largest immigration operation ever,” immigration agents have surrounded rideshare drivers and used pepper spray on high school students.

“Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement (ELITE) is a targeting tool designed to improve capabilities for identifying and prioritizing high-value targets through advanced analytics,” a user guide for ELITE obtained by 404 Media says. The tool aims to be nearly all encompassing when it comes to finding ICE targets, from identifying subjects in the first place, to building a list of people, to supervisors approving selections for officers to ultimately go into the field and apprehend.

One feature of ELITE is the “Geospatial Lead Sourcing Tab,” according to the user guide. This lets ICE see people it may potentially want to detain on a map interface, based on various criteria such as “Bios & IDs,” “Location,” “Operations,” and “Criminality.” An ICE officer can then select people one by one, or draw a shape on the map to see people in that selected area.

ELITE has already been used by ICE to target specific areas, according to sworn testimony from an ICE official in Oregon. In October, immigration officers waited in three unmarked SUVs outside an apartment complex in Woodburn. They went on to bust a driver’s window and pull a 45-year-old woman from a van, used ICE’s facial recognition app Mobile Fortify on her, and agents had the goal of making eight arrests per team per day, Oregon Live reported. Lawyers representing the woman say authorities arrested her and more than 30 other people in a “dragnet.” 

“One of our apps, it’s called ELITE. And so it tells you how many people are living in this area and what’s the likelihood of them actually being there,” a deportation officer with ICE’s Fugitive Operations Unit, identified in court records as JB, testified about the raid in early December. 404 Media purchased a transcript of JB’s testimony from the court. “It’s basically a map of the United States. It’s kind of like Google Maps.”

“It pulls from all kinds of sources,” JB continued. “It’s a newer app that was actually given to us in ICE.” JB said ELITE is what ICE sometimes uses to track the apparent density of people at a particular location to target. “You’re going to go to a more dense population rather than \[...\] like, if there’s one pin at a house and the likelihood of them actually living there is like 10 percent \[...\] you’re not going to go there.” For that raid in Woodburn, JB suggested the immigration officers used ELITE to generate leads. Additionally, in a text thread of immigration officers, someone described the area as “target rich,” which JB explained meant the officials had run multiple license plates in that area and found vehicles registered to people “who had either a criminal or immigration nexus.”

JB and other officials were testifying in the case of MJMA, the woman pulled from the van during the Woodburn raid. She is being represented by attorneys from Innovation Law Lab.

Once a person is selected on the map interface, ELITE then shows a dossier on that particular person, according to the user guide. That includes their name, a photo, their Alien Number (the unique code given by the U.S. government to each immigrant), their date of birth, and their full address. ELITE notes the source of the address (such as the government agency that supplied it), and gives an “address confidence score.” One address confidence score example in the guide is 98.95 out of 100; another is 77.25 out of 100. This score is based on both the source of the address and how recent the data is, the user guide says. (ICE is paying skip tracers, private investigators, and bounty hunters to help verify peoples’ addresses.)

Those sources can include HHS, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), and “CLEAR.” The guide does not provide any more specifics on what CLEAR might be, but ICE has repeatedly contracted with Thomson Reuters which sells a data product called CLEAR. Thomson Reuters did not respond to a request for comment. HHS did not respond to a request for comment.

The documents don’t say if those are the only entities providing data for ELITE. The user guide says ELITE is “integrating new data sources” to reduce officer workload.

ICE can also use ELITE to look up people based on an unique identifier, such as their Alien Number, name, or date of birth. ELITE also lets ICE do this in bulk, selecting up to 50 people at once, according to the guide. 

ICE can filter the map by what the guide calls Special Operations. These are “groups of pre-defined aliens specifically targeted by Leadership for action.” ICE officers are told to consult ICE leadership or “broadcasts” on when to use these operation filters. DHS’s surge in Minneapolis is focused at least in part on the city’s Somali community after renewed focus on a COVID-19 fraud case. The overwhelming majority of Somalis who live in the Minneapolis and St. Paul area are U.S. citizens, PBS reported.

“These records give us behind-the-scenes insight into the kind of mass surveillance machine ICE is building with help from powerful tech companies like Palantir,” Laura Rivera, senior staff attorney at Just Futures Law, told 404 Media. “When combined with what we know from ICE testimony and other public information, it gives us a blueprint into how ICE is going into communities and identifying people for arrest in real-time.”

Senator Ron Wyden, who represents Oregon where ELITE was discussed, told 404 Media in a statement, “The fact ICE is using this app proves the completely indiscriminate nature of the agency's aggressive and violent incursions into our communities. This app allows ICE to find the closest person to arrest and disappear, using government and commercial data, with the help of Palantir and Trump's Big Brother databases. It makes a mockery of the idea that ICE is trying to make our country safer. Rather, agents are reportedly picking people to deport from our country the same way you'd choose a nearby coffee shop.”

The ELITE user guide does not say who developed the system. But the tool's distinctive title-Enhanced Leads Identification & Targeting for Enforcement-exactly matches one included in an addendum to a Palantir contract from last year. It says Palantir should ""continue configuration and engineering services"" for ELITE and some other ICE tools. That supplemental agreement for $29.9 million started in September and is planned to go on for at least a year.

Palantir has worked with ICE for years and was focused on criminal investigations, supporting Homeland Security Investigations' (HSI) Investigative Case Management (ICM) system. That changed in the second Trump administration, with Palantir now working on ICE's deportation efforts.

After participating in a three-week coding sprint, ICE updated an ongoing Palantir contract related to ""Enforcement Prioritization and Targeting,"" to ""support the development of an accurate picture of actionable leads based on existing law enforcement datasets to allow law enforcement to prioritize enforcement actions,"" according to an internal Palantir wiki previously obtained by 404 Media. The goal was to find the physical location of people marked for deportation, and Palantir said it believes its work with ICE is ""intended to promote government efficiency, transparency, and accountability.""

The leaked material described Palantir's deportation-focused work as ""concentrated on delivering prototype capabilities"" and lasting around six months. It left open the room for more work with ICE, and said ""Palantir has developed into a more mature partner for ICE."" Documents ICE published described Palantir's work as building a tool called ImmigrationOS.

More than eight months have passed since Palantir discussed the issue internally. Neither Palantir nor DHS responded to multiple requests for comment.

In their testimony, JB said, ""it's a tool that we use that gives you a probability. But there's never \[...\] there's no such thing as 100 percent."" The user guide adds, ""As always, make sure you do your due diligence on each target to confirm removability prior to action.""",1,1768650888.0,WhatTrumpHasDone,0,1.0,False

I live in southern WV in a dark, dark holler. I woke up around 4:45am to a very clear “bang bang bang bang” that sounded like it was coming from all around the room. Thinking it was my cats, I got up to see what they were getting into. I walked out of the room and all 3 of them were sitting up in their beds, ears back, trying to trace the sound. Fiancée is still asleep so it hasn’t woke her up yet.

“BANG BANG BANG BANG”

Is it coming from under the house? Maybe something’s got under there and is fuckin around? I waited for it again.

“BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG BANG”

Louder this time, accompanied by what sounded like a woman saying something. I checked my outdoor cameras and nothing. It’s not coming from my house. But from outside.

More bangs followed up by a “hey!”

I stepped out onto my front porch, lit a cigarette, and listened. Eyes searching for something in the dark.

“Hi”

A woman’s voice from across the way, about 100 feet away from me, near my neighbors house.

“Hello” I responded in a confused & apprehensive tone.

“Ohh, I thought you was someone else” said the voice, I still couldn’t make out a figure, just the direction the voice was coming from.

“Is that you making that banging sound?”

“YEAH IT IS! AND IF YOU DON’T LIKE IT YOU CAN CALL THE FUGGIN LAW!”

I sighed and went back inside to the tune of her banging on my neighbors door shouting “OPEN THE GAWT-DAMN DOOR YOU PIECE OF SHIT! YOU KNEW I I WAS COMIN”

I decided to make my coffee and just stay awake. No point in trying to tuck back in.

Just goes to show you that if something goes bump in the night, it’s prolly just your shitbird neighbor having a shitbird guest come over to do early morning shitbird activities.

The first time I should have died, I didn’t have the courtesy to recognize it as anything dramatic. No premonition. No slow-motion montage. Just a Tuesday that already felt slightly cursed—bad coffee, a thin ringing in my left ear, and a four o’clock dentist appointment where I planned to nod through the floss lecture like a man taking communion.

The sky was the kind that makes you suspicious if you’re paying attention. Too clean for April. Too bright, like someone had polished the whole dome overhead until the blue looked manufactured. Even the clouds seemed trimmed and placed on purpose, each one crisp along the edges, as if a careless hand hadn’t been allowed near the canvas.

I drove the route I always drove: past the strip mall with the vape shop and the discount mattress place, past the little church where the crooked LED sign blinked JESUS like it was stuttering. My phone buzzed once in the cupholder—Mom’s name flashed—then went quiet again. I didn’t pick it up. I never did while driving. I told myself that meant I was responsible.

At the light by the feed store, I rolled to the front of the line. A semi idled in the lane to my left, a wall of metal and height that blocked half the world, and even through closed windows I could smell the diesel, sour and heavy, like something old breathing beside me.

The light turned green.

I went, because green means go and I’m not the kind of person who treats driving like a philosophy problem.

*That’s when the rules cracked.*

From the right, a black SUV came at me as if it had been kicked into motion. I caught the driver’s face for a fraction of a second—pale, mouth open, eyes aimed past me instead of at me, like he’d already left the moment and his body was only finishing what he’d started.

No horn. No squeal of brakes. Not even the chance for anger.

Just one clean, weirdly calm thought: *Oh. That’s it.*

Impact wasn’t a sound so much as pressure—like a massive hand closing around my chest. The steering wheel jumped into me. The windshield flashed white and broke into a storm of glittering fragments. My head snapped back and forward hard enough that my teeth clicked together.

And then—

I was still driving through the intersection.

Green light. Smooth pavement. The semi still rumbling alongside me, exactly where it had been.

My mouth opened for a scream, but my lungs didn’t cooperate at first, as if they hadn’t gotten the memo. My heart hammered so violently I tasted copper.

I looked to the right.

The SUV was there, but it was stopped perfectly at the red light like a model citizen, hands at ten and two, face blank, gaze fixed forward. Like it had never been anything else.

I went past him with my whole body buzzing like a power line in the rain. In the mirror, he stayed put. The light stayed red. The world acted offended by my confusion.

By the time I pulled into the dentist’s parking lot, my hands were slick on the wheel and my shirt clung to my ribs. I just sat there with my forehead pressed against the steering wheel, breathing in shallow, ugly pulls, trying to convince myself I’d had a momentary lapse—some nasty little brain trick.

Near-miss hallucination. Stress. A daydream with teeth.

Except my chest still ached, not like soreness, not like bruising. It hurt the way a muscle hurts after it’s been squeezed too hard and then let go, like fingertips had pressed into me and left a memory behind.

Inside, the receptionist smiled and said, “Hey, *Mark*—running right on time.”

I froze with my hand hovering over the clipboard.

*Mark wasn’t my name.*

I gave her my real name—no, I’m not putting it here; it’s mine—and she blinked, then did a quick laugh like she’d made an innocent mistake. “Oh my God, I’m sorry. You look like a Mark I know.”

Plausible. Everything was plausible if you swallowed it fast enough.

The cleaning itself was normal in that particular way dentistry always is—bright lamp, cold tools, the hygienist’s careful chatter while she scraped at the places I always missed. On the wall-mounted TV, daytime news played with the sound off, and I watched the ticker crawl by to give my mind something simple to cling to.

Except the city name in the ticker was spelled wrong. One letter off.

A typo, sure. That’s what it was. It had to be. Still, I stared at it until my eyes watered, and when the hygienist asked if I was okay, I nodded because the alternative was explaining that the world had started mislabeling itself in small, petty ways.

I took side streets home. I avoided major intersections like they were hungry. The whole drive I watched other cars as if any of them might suddenly decide it was time to erase me again.

Scout met me at the door the way he always did—nails skittering on the tile, tail wagging hard enough to throw his hips around. He shoved his nose into my hand, and I knelt to ruffle his ears and pressed my face into his neck because his fur smelled like warm dust and grass and that faint corn-chip odor dogs get between their toes.

Scout had a white blaze on his snout that I’d always called his “kiss mark,” because it looked like a small flame. Like the universe had leaned down and left him a blessing.

Only now it didn’t look like a flame.

It was a line. Straight and narrow. Almost like a scar.

I pulled back and held his head gently between my hands, staring so hard my eyes burned. Scout just gazed up at me with those brown, trusting eyes and licked my chin, unbothered, as if I were the strange one—and maybe I was.

I wandered the house touching things to reassure myself: the chipped coffee mug, the dent in the hallway drywall from when I moved the couch two years ago and got cocky, the framed photo of my parents at Niagara Falls with Dad’s baseball cap tilted and Mom’s smile wide.

Most of it felt right.

But the little things were… off, like the universe had been reassembled by someone who’d done a decent job but didn’t own the original instructions. The fridge magnet that used to say Hawaii now said Maui in big letters, even though I’d never been to Maui. The salt shaker had a blue lid when I was sure it had been red. The spare key on the hook by the door was a different cut on the same ring.

Nothing you could take to court. Nothing you could show a friend without earning a look that says Are you sleeping? Are you using something?

That night I left the lights on.

When I finally fell asleep, I dreamed of the intersection again. In the dream, the SUV hit me over and over, each impact identical—pressure, shatter, darkness—and each time, like a cruel joke, I was back at the green light again with my hands steady on the wheel and the semi beside me and the world pretending it hadn’t just snapped my neck.

The last time, right before impact, I looked at the driver.

It was me behind the wheel, mouth open, eyes aimed past myself, already absent.

I woke up with my tongue bitten and my heart racing.

The next morning I went to work because normal people go to work even when their minds are trying to assemble meaning out of nonsense.

The office was the same fluorescent purgatory: Kevin from accounting chewing ice like it was a sport, Sherry at the front desk wearing that lavender perfume that made my eyes itch. The rhythm of it should’ve soothed me. Instead it made me feel like I was walking through a set that could be taken down at any moment.

I sat at my computer, typed my password.

It failed.

I tried again. Failed.

Annoyed and a little rattled, I clicked through a reset and got hit with a security question:

\`What is the name of your first pet?\`

My first pet had been a cat named Whiskers. I got him when I was seven. He lived fifteen years, died while I was in college, and I’d cried into my hoodie on my dorm bed like a kid who couldn’t pretend he was tough anymore.

I typed \`WHISKERS\`

\`Rejected\`

\`WHISKER\`

\`Rejected\`

A hint appeared. Just one letter:

\`S\`

A slow chill rolled through my stomach. I sat there staring at the screen until the monitor’s glow felt harsh and personal, like it was judging me.

Some part of my brain kept trying to label it as a technical problem—database mismatch, user profile corruption, a dumb glitch that would be funny later. But something older and quieter inside me said: *No. This isn’t the computer. This is you.*

I called the higher-tier IT line—my own department, just not my desk—and a guy named Nolan answered in his usual bored-cheerful voice. I explained the problem. I heard him clicking around in my account.

“Huh,” he said. “Looks like your security answers were updated last month.”

“I didn’t update them.”

“Maybe it happened during the forced reset.”

“No,” I said, sharper than I meant to, and it earned me a small pause on the other end.

“I can see the answer,” Nolan said finally, cautious now. “But I can’t tell you.”

“Then just tell me the first letter.”

He exhaled. “It starts with S. And… it’s a dog.”

My mouth went dry.

“My first pet wasn’t a dog.”

A thin chuckle. “Okay, man. But your file says it was. ‘Sparky.’”

Sparky.

It meant nothing to me and everything to someone else—someone wearing my credentials, living in the shape of my life.

I hung up without saying goodbye.

The rest of the day I moved through the office on autopilot, smiling at jokes, answering emails, doing small normal tasks like a man trying to prove he was real by completing forms. The pressure in my chest didn’t go away; it just settled heavier, like water behind a dam.

I took side streets home again, watching every car too closely. At home, Scout greeted me, tail wagging, the straight white line on his snout as undeniable as a signature.

My phone buzzed. Mom again.

This time I answered.

“Hey,” she said, bright and breathless, the way she gets when she’s already imagining a family scene. “I just wanted to make sure you’re still coming Saturday.”

“For what?” I asked, and I heard the edge in my own voice.

There was a beat of silence that felt like stepping onto a floor you expected to be solid.

“For… your sister’s baby shower.”

I let out a short laugh that didn’t sound like me. “Mom, I don’t have a sister.”

The quiet on the line stretched.

Then she said my name—my name, the one I refuse to hand over—and she said it gently, like she was approaching an injured animal.

“Honey,” she whispered. “Yes you do.”

My skin prickled all over. I suddenly felt nauseous, as if gravity had leaned to one side. I tried to picture my parents with another child. I tried to imagine a sister’s face, her voice, her smell when she hugged me. My mind offered a blank wall.

“Stop,” I said, barely audible.

“What’s wrong? Are you okay?” Her voice cracked.

“I’m tired,” I said, because it was the only lie that didn’t immediately collapse. “I’m just tired.”

“You’ve been working too much,” she said, relief pouring into her words. “Come on Saturday. You’ll feel better when you see everybody.”

“Yeah,” I managed.

When I hung up, I sat in the dim living room with Scout’s warm weight against my leg. The house made its small, ordinary night sounds: the fridge hum, the wall clock ticking, the faint settling creaks in the wood like a body shifting in sleep.

Everything normal.

Everything thin.

I thought about the intersection again, about the impact and then the impossible reset, like a game snapping back to an earlier save point. A rational person would call it a near-miss, the brain running a disaster simulation to keep you safe.

But my body remembered more than a simulation, and the world—these petty little edits—didn’t behave like imagination. It behaved like I’d been moved, not far, just enough to notice.

I went to bed early. No alcohol. No pills. I wanted my mind clear, because if something was wrong I needed to watch it happen without fog.

I lay there in the dark listening to Scout breathe on the floor beside the bed.

After midnight, a sound came from the kitchen.

A soft *click*.

Then another.

Like a fingernail tapping glass.

I held my breath. The air felt thicker than it should’ve, as if it had absorbed humidity and secrets. Another click followed—slow, patient, deliberate.

I slid my hand into the nightstand drawer and found the flashlight and the old baseball bat my dad had given me “just in case.” The bat felt like a child’s idea of protection, but it was better than my bare hands.

The clicking stopped.

For a moment I almost laughed at myself.

Then the smoke detector in the hallway *chirped*—one sharp beep—like it was testing.

I sat up.

Scout rose too, ears forward, a low growl vibrating in his chest.

The detector chirped again.

And again.

Not the battery warning. Not the full alarm. Just a measured, purposeful beep, as if it had something to say.

From the kitchen, a voice spoke—quiet, almost polite.

Not my mother. Not a neighbor. Not the television.

It sounded like someone standing just out of sight with a smile in the dark.

“Mark?” it said.

My blood went cold.

The voice said it like the name belonged to *me*.

And somewhere deep in my mind, like a light flickering at the end of a corridor, a thought surfaced that didn’t feel like mine at all:

*Maybe it does.*",1,1768650397.0,redditserials,0,1.0,False

I think I found where the previous logs ended.,"I do asset recovery. Most weeks, my job is just logging serial numbers on used Herman Miller chairs and hauling server racks out of dead startups. It’s repetitive, physical work. But today the work order came through on a priority-coded sheet with no client name: Site 04. Clear the backlog.

Site 04 is an old office complex on the outskirts of the city, the kind of place that looks like it was built in the late 90s and forgotten by the mid-2000s. When I pulled into the back-lot, the first thing I saw was a white sedan. It was exactly where the file an old logistics log from some clerk said it would be.

The car was slumped on its rear passenger tire, the rubber bonded to the asphalt after melting into the tar over years of summer heat. I checked the VIN against my digital work order and found a match. The keys were still in the ignition, which is a red flag in my line of work, but when I reached in to grab them, the metal was unnaturally cold.

Not just morning air cold, but deep-freezer cold. When I exhaled, my breath fogged in the air above the steering wheel. I left them where they were.

The building itself was wide open no guard, no alarm, not even a locked bolt. The glass doors just vibrated when I pushed them open, a sound so deep it hurt my teeth. Inside, the air was thick and smelled like stale breakroom coffee and caramel, like a photocopier had been left running for a decade.

I walked past a row of cubicles until I found a desk with a nameplate that read Gary. The desk was covered in a layer of fine, grey dust that didn't move when I breathed on it; it sat there like a hardened skin over the keyboard and a half eaten granola bar.

Sitting right in the center of that dust was a phone.

I picked it up. The screen was shattered into a spiderweb of cracks, but it wasn't dead. It was burning hot. so hot I had to wrap it in my work glove to hold it. It was stuck in a boot-loop, and every time the logo tried to load, a faint camera-shutter sound clicked from the internal speakers: click, click, click.

It was perfectly synced with the throbbing in my head. Suddenly, the loop stopped. It didn't ask for a passcode; it just dumped me straight into the last open tab.

It was a Reddit thread. I’m looking at it right now as I type this. It’s a post from a ""Surveyor"" out in the Mojave desert.

The last entry was timestamped three minutes ago. He was talking about a ""loud"" lamp and a man named Marcus.

I looked up at the window. It’s high noon outside, bright and clear, but in the reflection of the phone’s dark screen, the office lights are on and the sun is already down. In that reflection, I can see the silhouette of a man with a towel over his head sitting in the corner of the office behind me.

When I turned around, the corner was empty nothing but the grey dust but then I looked down. A white towel was lying on the carpet. I reached out and touched it. It was still damp. Cold and damp.

I walked toward the breakroom, following the smell of the coffee. On the wall, right next to a rusted microwave, were several brass plates. They didn't list room numbers or employee names; they listed GPS coordinates for the Mojave. One was for the exact spot where the Surveyor’s thread ended.

I looked back down at the phone. A new line of text had appeared on the thread, typed in real-time: He’s standing in the breakroom now. He’s looking at the plates.

I dropped the phone.

It didn't hit the floor. It just kept falling, sinking through the grey dust on the carpet like it was water, until the sound of the shutter click was no longer coming from the device. It was coming from inside my own chest. Every time I blink, I hear it. Click.

I’m not leaving. I can’t. Every time I blink, the shutter clicks, and the office around me gets a little more blurry, a little more grey.

The 14 Republics don't delete files, they just compress them until they don't take up space anymore.

I can feel it. My lungs aren't expanding because there’s no room left for air. The whole office is becoming two dimensional, warped . just a layer of grey dust waiting to be filed away.

The clicking in my chest is so loud now it’s the only thing I can hear.

It’s not a heartbeat.

It’s the sound of the system saving over me",4,1768650397.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False
1qfb7ba,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfb7ba,Burberry × Coffee：Luxury Steps into Street Coffee Culture in Shanghai,"**Luxury doesn’t always open a store. Sometimes, it parks on the street.**

In Shanghai, **Burberry** steps into **street coffee culture** with a mobile coffee experience that blends design, restraint, and everyday ritual. No boutique. No grand opening. Just a coffee stop that fits seamlessly into the city’s daily rhythm.

This is luxury meeting people where life actually happens — between meetings, along sidewalks, in moments that don’t ask for attention but leave a lasting impression. A familiar check. A measured palette. A cup in hand. Then the city moves on.

Not a campaign shouting for relevance.  
Not a café chasing trends.  
Just a global luxury brand choosing presence over spectacle.

Toward the end, she said she was overwhelmed. Said she still loved me but didn’t feel “in love” anymore. No big fight, just emotional distance, and eventually she ended it and then unfortunately she was immediately back on Tinder the next day, that's out of my control though. I sent a respectful message after, wishing her well, no bitterness. She replied politely, but distant.

I’ve reflected a lot since then, especially on how I became more anxious and insecure towards the end when she started to withdraw. I’m not looking to rekindle things necessarily, but part of me wants to send **one** calm message to see if she'd be willing to meet for a coffee.

I understand the risks of that, but I feel like if she doesn’t respond or declines, at least I’d have my answer. And I’d know I tried once, calmly, before fully moving on.

That changed when I bought Colombia El Diviso Ombligon from my local roaster.

I also picked up a Hario V60 to experiment a bit more.

*Beans:* Colombia El Diviso Ombligon by Nestor Lasso  
(Filter & espresso roast, roasted on January 5)

My first cup with these beans was made using the Moka pot and it was incredible. I got lots of cherry and liqueur-like notes. Just wow. I’d never had coffee like that before.

Then I wanted to get the most out of these beans, so I decided to try them with the V60.

First attempt:

* Coffee: 17 g
* Water: 220 g
* Grind size: 25 clicks

The result was very weak and quite acidic. No cherry notes at all.

Second attempt:

* Coffee: 16 g
* Water: 250 g
* Grind size: 22 clicks

I followed James Hoffmann’s recipe from his book. This cup was much better - stronger, with a bit of cherry notes.

1qfb056,https://youtu.be/FBK5vyLaA3M,5 Very Scary TRUE Desolate Farmhouse Caretaker Horror Stories,"# ""BEHIND THE CURTAIN"":

I took the job because I needed the work. The Bender family owned this big stretch of land out in the middle of nowhere, with a small house they called home and a barn where they kept horses and tools. It was far from any town, just flat grass and dirt roads that travelers used sometimes. Mr. Bender, the old man, hired me to fix fences, tend the garden, and help with whatever came up. He was a tall guy with a thick accent, didn't talk much. His wife, Mrs. Bender, stayed inside most days, cooking or sewing. Then there was their son, John, who laughed at odd times, and their daughter, Kate, who was pretty but had a way of looking at you that made you uneasy.

My first day, I arrived with my bag of clothes and a few tools. The house looked plain, one big room split by a canvas sheet hanging like a curtain. They had a little store in the front part, selling dry goods to people passing by. Mr. Bender showed me to a small shack out back where I could sleep. ""You work hard, you eat with us,"" he said in his rough voice. I nodded and got to fixing a broken gate.

As days went on, I noticed things that didn't sit right. Travelers would stop for a meal or to rest their horses. Kate would talk to them, smiling and telling stories about being a healer. She said she could fix aches with her hands or talk to spirits, but she never mentioned anything strange like ghosts. One evening, a man in a nice coat came in. He was heading west for land. Kate sat him at the table near the curtain, pouring him coffee. John was in the back, hammering something. I was outside chopping wood, but I heard the man say, ""This coffee tastes funny."" Kate laughed and said, ""It's our special blend. Drink up, it'll give you strength for the road.""

Later that night, I saw John digging in the orchard under the moon. I asked him what he was doing. ""Planting apples,"" he said, but he didn't have any trees with him. Just a shovel and dirt. I went back to my shack, but sleep didn't come easy. The next morning, the man's horse was still tied up, but he was gone. Mr. Bender said he left early. I looked for the man's wagon, but it wasn't there. Kate smiled at me over breakfast and said, ""Don't worry about folks coming and going. That's life on the trail.""

Weeks passed, and more people stopped by. A doctor from town came once, looking for his brother who had passed through. He sat at that same spot by the curtain. Kate kept him talking about his family. I was in the barn when I heard a thud, like something heavy falling. I ran in, but the doctor was gone. Mrs. Bender was mopping the floor, and she glared at me. ""Mind your business, caretaker,"" she snapped. ""He paid and left."" But I saw a red stain on the wood before she cleaned it.

I started keeping watch. One night, I couldn't sleep, so I crept close to the house. Through the window, I saw Kate and John whispering. ""He had gold in his pocket,"" John said, laughing that weird laugh. Kate shushed him. ""Quiet. The caretaker might hear."" I backed away slow, my hands shaking. What gold? No one had come that day.

The next morning, a family pulled up – a man, his wife, and a little girl. They looked tired from the road. Mr. Bender invited them in for supper. I helped stable their horses. The man thanked me and said, ""Nice place you got here. Quiet."" I wanted to warn him, but what could I say? Kate served them stew. The little girl ate quick, but the parents sipped slow. ""This meat is fresh,"" the wife said. Kate nodded. ""From our own land.""

After they went to bed in the front room, I stayed up in my shack. Hours later, I heard a scream, short and cut off. I grabbed my lantern and ran out. The house was dark, but the barn door was open. I went in and saw John dragging something wrapped in a blanket. ""What is that?"" I asked, my voice low. He turned, his eyes wide. ""Nothing for you. Go back to bed."" But the blanket moved a bit, then stopped. I smelled blood.

I couldn't stay away. I snuck to the orchard where John had dug before. The ground was soft in spots. I poked with a stick and hit something hard. Digging a little, I found a boot sticking out. A man's boot, with the foot still in it. I dropped the stick and ran back to my shack, locking the door. Who were these people? Killers? For money?

The next day, I acted normal, but inside I was scared stiff. Kate came to me while I fixed a fence. ""You look pale,"" she said, touching my arm. ""Something wrong?"" I shook my head. ""Just tired."" She leaned close. ""We like you here. Stay, and you'll be part of the family."" Her smile didn't reach her eyes.

That afternoon, another traveler came, a big guy with a gun on his belt. He ate quick, but kept looking around. ""Heard stories about this trail,"" he said to Mr. Bender. ""People vanishing."" Mr. Bender grunted. ""Indians, maybe."" The man nodded but watched Kate careful. When she tried to seat him by the curtain, he moved to the other side. ""Better view,"" he said. John stood behind the canvas, hammer in hand. I saw it through a crack. The man finished and left fast. Kate watched him go, her face hard.

I knew I had to leave. But that night, I heard footsteps outside my shack. The door creaked. I sat up, grabbing my knife. ""Who's there?"" No answer. Then a whisper: ""Caretaker, open up."" It was Kate. I didn't move. She pushed the door, but it was locked. ""I know you saw things,"" she said soft. ""Come out, we can talk."" I stayed quiet. After a while, she left.

Morning came, and I packed my bag. But as I stepped out, John was waiting with a shovel. ""Going somewhere?"" he asked, laughing. Mr. Bender came up behind him. ""We need you to dig today."" I backed up. ""I quit."" Mrs. Bender stepped out the house, holding a knife. ""No one quits us.""

I ran for the barn, heart racing. They chased me. I grabbed a pitchfork and swung it. John lunged, but I jabbed him in the arm. He yelled. Kate screamed, ""Get him!"" I jumped on a horse and rode hard, not looking back. Dust flew up as I went down the trail.

I made it to town and told the sheriff everything. They went out there with men. The Benders were gone, fled in the night. But they found the bodies – eleven at least, buried in the garden and orchard. Men with smashed heads, throats cut. Even a little girl, buried with her father. The town folks tore the house apart, looking for clues. They found hammers with blood, a trap door under the table leading to a pit full of dark stains.

I never went back. That desolate place haunts my dreams. The Benders vanished, maybe to another lonely spot to do it again. If you're ever on a quiet road and see a farmhouse offering rest, keep going. You never know who's waiting behind the curtain.





# ""KEEPSAKES"":

The place sat way out in the countryside, with fields stretching empty around it. Mr. Harlan lived there alone after his family passed away years ago. He was quiet, always fixing things or reading old books. He hired me to help with chores like mending fences and feeding the few animals he kept. I showed up every afternoon after school let out.

On my first day, Mr. Harlan met me at the door. His eyes looked tired, like he hadn't slept well. ""Come in, boy,"" he said. ""The work is simple. Just do what I ask, and don't go poking around where you shouldn't."" I nodded and followed him inside. The house smelled musty, like dust and old wood. Some rooms had doors shut tight, with boards nailed over them. ""Those were my mother's,"" he explained. ""I keep them just as she left them.""

We worked in the barn that day, stacking hay. Mr. Harlan didn't talk much, but when he did, his voice was soft. ""Life out here is hard,"" he told me while we lifted bales. ""People come and go. Some don't come back."" I thought he meant they moved away, but something in how he said it made me uneasy. I asked what he meant, but he just shook his head and changed the subject.

A few days later, I noticed odd things. While cleaning the toolshed, I found a box under a workbench. It had strange shapes wrapped in cloth. I didn't open it, but it felt heavy and lumpy. Mr. Harlan caught me looking. ""That's nothing for you,"" he snapped, quicker than usual. ""Stay away from my things."" His face turned red, and he sent me home early. That night, I couldn't stop thinking about it.

As weeks went by, the farm felt more wrong. One evening, we sat on the porch after work. Mr. Harlan offered me a glass of water. ""You ever think about death, boy?"" he asked. I shook my head no. He leaned back in his chair. ""My mother taught me it's part of life. She said we all end up the same. Skin and bones."" He smiled a little, but it didn't reach his eyes. ""Sometimes I make things to remember people by. Like lamps or belts."" I laughed, thinking it was a joke, but he didn't laugh back. ""It's true,"" he added. ""Want to see?""

I said no, but he stood up anyway. ""Come to the kitchen."" Inside, he pointed to a bowl on the shelf. It looked funny, not like regular china. ""That's from someone special,"" he whispered. I backed away, saying I had to go home. He nodded. ""Suit yourself. But come back tomorrow. Work's not done.""

The next day, I almost didn't go, but I needed the pay. When I arrived, the house was quiet. Mr. Harlan called from the back. ""In here, boy. Help me move something."" I went to the small room where he lived. It was messy, with papers and magazines everywhere. He had me lift a heavy trunk. As we carried it, something rattled inside. ""What's in there?"" I asked. He set it down and opened the lid just a crack. ""Keepsakes,"" he said. I glimpsed what looked like bones, white and clean. My hands shook, but I pretended not to see.

That afternoon, while he was out in the field, I sneaked back to the shed. The box was still there. I unwrapped one cloth. Inside was a mask, made of what looked like dried leather, with holes for eyes. It had hair attached, gray and stringy. I dropped it and ran out. What was this man doing?

Later, Mr. Harlan found me by the fence. ""You look pale,"" he said. ""Something wrong?"" I mumbled no. He patted my shoulder. ""Good. Tonight, we'll work late. I have a special job."" His grip was firm, too firm.

As the sun went down, he took me to the orchard behind the house. ""Dig here,"" he ordered, handing me a shovel. The ground was soft, like it had been turned before. ""Why?"" I asked. ""Just dig,"" he replied. ""You'll see."" I started, but every scoop made me more afraid. What if something was buried there? He watched me, his eyes shining in the fading light.

After a bit, my shovel hit something hard. ""Keep going,"" he urged. I cleared the dirt and saw a cloth bundle. ""Open it,"" he said, his voice excited. I refused. ""Do it, boy."" He stepped closer. I pulled the cloth back. Inside was a human hand, cut clean, skin wrinkled and pale. I screamed and threw the shovel.

Mr. Harlan laughed, a low sound. ""It's from Mrs. Warden, the store lady. She didn't need it anymore."" He reached for me. ""Now you know my secret. You can help me make more.""

I ran. Through the fields, past the barn, to the road. He chased, calling my name. ""Come back! We can be family!"" His footsteps pounded behind me. I didn't stop until I reached town, bursting into the sheriff's office.

They went back that night. Found more parts in the house—skins stretched like hides, bowls from skulls, even a suit made from pieces. Mr. Harlan had killed two women, taken bodies from graves. All to feel close to his dead mother, he said later.

I never went near that farm again. But sometimes, I dream of his voice, whispering about keepsakes. The farm burned down soon after, but the memories stay.





# ""HIRED TO DIE"":

My life took a dark turn when I answered that online ad back in 2011. I had been scraping by as a landscaper down in South Carolina, but work was drying up, and I needed something steady. The posting caught my eye—it promised a job as a caretaker on a big cattle farm up in Ohio. Room and board included, plus a decent pay. The place was described as quiet and out of the way, perfect for someone like me who wanted to get away from city noise. I figured it could be a fresh beginning. I emailed the guy who posted it, and soon we set up a meeting.

I drove my old truck north, excited but a bit nervous. The man I was supposed to meet called himself Joe. He sounded friendly on the phone, asked about my background, if I had family close by. I told him no, I was on my own mostly. That seemed to make him happy. We agreed to link up at a little restaurant off the highway near Caldwell. When I got there, Joe was waiting with a younger fellow he introduced as his nephew. Joe was in his fifties, heavy-set, with a beard and a calm way of talking. The nephew was quiet, maybe seventeen, with messy hair and eyes that didn't meet mine much.

We sat down over coffee. Joe explained the job again. ""The farm's about 688 acres,"" he said. ""Mostly cattle, some equipment to fix. You'll have your own cabin, nothing fancy, but it's peaceful out there. No neighbors for miles."" I nodded, liking the sound of it. He asked if I had brought my things, since the ad said to come ready to start. I pointed to my truck outside, packed with my clothes and tools. ""Good,"" Joe said with a smile. ""Let's head over now. You can follow us in your truck.""

We drove for what felt like forever on winding back roads. The trees got thicker, the houses fewer. My truck bumped along behind their car. I started wondering how far out this farm really was. Finally, Joe pulled over on a dirt path that led into the woods. He got out and waved me over. ""The main road's washed out up ahead,"" he explained. ""We'll walk from here. It's not far. Grab what you need.""

I slung my bag over my shoulder and followed them down a narrow trail. The nephew walked ahead, not saying much. Joe chatted about the land, how it had been in his family for years. ""You'll like it,"" he said. ""Real quiet. Just you, the cows, and the wind."" But something felt off. The path got steeper, and there were no signs of a farm—no fences, no barns, nothing. I asked, ""How much farther?"" Joe glanced back. ""Just a bit. I want to show you where I got a deer last week. Good hunting around here too.""

We stopped in a small clearing. Joe bent down like he was looking for something on the ground. The nephew stood a little ways off. I set my bag down, wiping sweat from my face. Then Joe straightened up, and in his hand was a small gun. His face changed—no more friendly smile. ""Sorry, buddy,"" he said quietly. ""I brought you here to die."" My mind went blank for a second. I stared at him, thinking it had to be a joke. But he raised the gun, and I turned to run.

The shot cracked through the air, and pain exploded in my arm. I stumbled but kept going, crashing through bushes and branches. Blood soaked my sleeve, but I didn't stop. Behind me, I heard Joe yelling at the nephew. ""Get him!"" Footsteps pounded after me. I dove behind a fallen log, holding my breath. My arm throbbed, but I bit my lip to stay silent. They searched for a while, calling out. ""Come on out, we can talk this over."" But I knew better. The nephew's voice shook when he spoke. ""Uncle Joe, what if he gets away?"" Joe snapped back, ""He won't. Keep looking.""

Hours passed as I lay there, the sun dipping low. Bugs crawled on me, but I didn't move. My arm went numb, and I worried about bleeding out. Finally, the sounds faded. I waited until dark, then crept out, following the path back the way we came. Every rustle made me freeze—were they still out there? I imagined Joe lurking behind every tree, gun ready. My truck was gone when I reached the road. I walked for miles, dizzy and weak, until I saw lights from a house in the distance.

I knocked on the door, and an older couple answered. The woman gasped when she saw me. ""What happened to you?"" she asked. I collapsed on their porch. ""Call the police,"" I managed to say. ""They tried to kill me."" The man helped me inside while his wife dialed for help. I told them everything—the ad, the meeting, the walk into the woods. Paramedics came and bandaged my arm. It was a graze, but deep enough to scar. The police listened to my story, skeptical at first, but they searched the area.

That's when they found the bodies. Two other men, buried shallow in those same woods. One was a guy named Ralph, who'd gone missing months before. The other was David, who'd answered the same ad. Later, they dug up another body near Akron—Tim, poor soul. Joe—whose real name was Richard Beasley—had been doing this for weeks, luring guys like me who wouldn't be missed right away. He stole our stuff, our identities even. The nephew turned out to be a kid he'd roped in, scared into helping.

I testified at the trial, facing Beasley across the courtroom. He stared at me with cold eyes, like he regretted missing that shot. The jury convicted him, and he got the death penalty. But even now, years later, I wake up sweating, hearing that gunshot in my dreams. I never took another job from an online ad. And I stay far from quiet back roads. That farm never existed—it was all a trap. If I hadn't run fast enough, I'd be buried out there too, forgotten in the dirt.





# ""REMNANTS"":

I started at the Carteron farm just after the big war ended, when everything still felt broken and quiet. The place was out in the flat lands of central France, with fields all around and no close neighbors except one house far off. Mr. Carteron hired me to help with the animals and the small crops. He was a strong man, always working, but he kept to himself. His wife, Mrs. Carteron, cooked simple meals and mended clothes. Their son, Andre, was young and helped with chores. There was also young Claude, who stayed with them like family, learning the farm work. I had a tiny room in the barn, away from the main house.

The farm felt lonely, but I needed the job. Mr. Carteron paid in food and a little money. ""Just do your part, Pierre,"" he told me on my first day. ""We don't need trouble here.""

Days passed with the usual tasks: feeding the chickens, fixing fences, milking the cow. But soon, Mr. Carteron seemed worried. One evening as we sat by the fire after supper, he stared out the window. ""Someone's watching,"" he said softly.

Mrs. Carteron put down her knitting. ""What do you mean, Kleber?""

""I felt it last winter, walking home. Steps behind me, but when I turned, nothing."" He looked at me. ""Pierre, you see anything odd?""

I shook my head. ""No, sir. Just the wind in the trees.""

Andre laughed a bit. ""Papa, it's probably a fox or a deer.""

But Mr. Carteron didn't smile. ""Keep the doors locked at night. And the dog—let him bark if he hears something.""

Claude nodded, his eyes wide. ""I'll check the barn before bed.""

That night, I lay in my room, listening. The dog whined once, then went quiet. I thought it was nothing.

A few days later, while I mended a gate near the woods, I found a strange spot—a pile of branches like a hidden shelter, not far from the path. It looked fresh, with flattened grass inside. I told Mr. Carteron.

His face went pale. ""Don't go there again. Stay close to the house.""

""Why?"" I asked.

He paused. ""During the war, things happened in those woods. People hiding, dropping supplies. I saw too much once. Best to forget.""

Mrs. Carteron overheard and crossed herself. ""Enough talk. Supper's ready.""

We ate in silence that evening. Andre tried to joke. ""Maybe it's a treasure hunter, looking for lost gold.""

Claude smiled weakly. ""Or a lost soldier.""

But the air felt heavy. After, I walked them to the house and went to my barn room. The dog followed me, curling up outside.

Late that night, I woke to voices—low and rough, from the direction of the house. The dog growled, then yelped sharp and stopped. My body went cold. I slipped to the window, peeking out. Shadows moved near the farmhouse door. Two figures, maybe three, dark against the night. One carried something long, like a tool or gun.

I grabbed my lantern but didn't light it. Quietly, I crept closer, hiding behind a bush. The door creaked open. A crash inside—glass breaking. Then Mrs. Carteron's voice: ""Who are you? What do you want?""

A man's gruff reply: ""Quiet. Where's Kleber?""

Mr. Carteron shouted: ""Get out! We have nothing!""

Sounds of struggle—thumps, a chair falling. Andre cried out: ""Papa!""

Claude's voice: ""Leave them alone!""

I wanted to run in, to help, but fear rooted me. More thumps, then silence except for muffled words. I inched forward, heart loud in my ears. Through a side window, I saw them: three men, faces hidden by cloths, tying ropes around the family's wrists and ankles. Mr. Carteron on the floor, blood on his head. Mrs. Carteron whispering prayers. Andre and Claude face down, shaking.

One man held a strange gun—short and metal. ""You saw too much,"" he said to Mr. Carteron. ""In the woods. Can't have that.""

""Please,"" Mrs. Carteron begged. ""We told no one.""

The man shook his head. ""Too late.""

They forced them all face down on the stone floor. I gasped, covering my mouth. The gun barked—sharp pops, one after another. Bodies jerked, then stilled. Smoke filled the room. The men stood, checking cupboards, grabbing a few things—a bag, some papers.

One said: ""The dog?""

""Already done,"" another replied.

They left through the door, footsteps fading toward the woods.

I stayed hidden, trembling, until dawn. Tears wet my face. Why? What had Mr. Carteron seen?

When light came, I crept to the house. The door hung open. Inside, the horror—bodies bound, blood dark on the floor. The dog lay outside, neck broken. I backed away, sick, and ran to the neighbor's house, pounding the door.

""Mrs. Jugand! Help! They're dead!""

She opened, eyes wide. ""What?""

""The Carterons—killed! All of them!""

Her husband came, and we went back together. He saw and turned white. ""I'll get the mayor.""

Police came from town, asking questions. ""You saw the men?"" one officer said.

""Yes, but not their faces. Three, with a gun like from the war.""

They searched the woods, found the shelter, the bag with Andre's schoolbook. Rumors spread—old war grudges, hidden fighters settling scores. They questioned people, even found a gun at a former leader's home, but nothing stuck. Months passed, no arrests.

I left the farm after. Couldn't stay with the memories—the voices, the pops, the blood. The place stands empty now, weeds growing. They say it was revenge from the past, but no one knows for sure. Sometimes I dream of those shadows, wondering if they're still out there, watching from the trees. The quiet farm hides its secret, and I wonder if it'll ever tell.





# ""THE KUNZ"":

I started helping out at the Kunz farm last spring because jobs were scarce in Athens, and a neighbor mentioned the family needed someone to clean and tend the garden. The house stood way back in the woods, off a dirt road that hardly anyone used. Trees crowded around it, and the building looked worn down, with peeling paint and junk piled high in the yard. Clarence ran the place, along with his wife Irene and his sister Marie. Helen lived there too, with her grown sons Randy and Kenneth. The family kept to themselves, and folks in town whispered about them, but I figured it was just talk.

On my first day, Irene met me at the door. She was old, with gray hair pulled tight in a bun, and she smiled a little. ""Come in, dear. We appreciate the help. The house gets away from us sometimes.""

I nodded and stepped inside. The air smelled musty, like old paper and dust. The kitchen had dishes stacked in the sink, and the floor needed sweeping bad. I got to work scrubbing while Irene sat at the table, peeling potatoes. ""You live alone?"" she asked.

""Yes, ma'am. Just me in a small apartment in town.""

She glanced up. ""Good. Family can be... complicated.""

I didn't think much of it then. As I cleaned, I noticed odd things. In the living room, boxes of tapes sat on the shelves—adult movies, the kind with covers that made me blush. I pretended not to see them and dusted around. Randy came in later, a tall man with messy hair. He grabbed a drink from the fridge without saying hello. Helen followed him, her eyes sharp. ""Who's this?"" she asked.

Irene answered. ""Our new helper, Linda. She's here to tidy up.""

Helen stared at me for a long moment. ""Don't touch anything in the bedrooms. We handle those.""

I agreed and kept working. That afternoon, while weeding the garden, Kenneth drove up in his truck. He was quieter than Randy, but he helped unload some firewood. ""Thanks for coming,"" he said. ""It's hard keeping up.""

""No problem,"" I replied. ""Nice to have work.""

As days went by, I learned their routines. Clarence fixed fences in the fields, Marie fed the few chickens they had left, and the others stayed inside mostly. The farm wasn't big anymore—just some vegetables and old equipment rusting away. One time, while mopping the hall, I heard voices from upstairs. Low murmurs, like arguing. I paused, but couldn't make out words. When I asked Irene later, she shrugged. ""Just family matters. Nothing for you.""

But it bothered me. The house felt wrong, with all that clutter. Papers and empty cans everywhere, and no bathroom inside—they used an outhouse. I had to go outside for that, which made me nervous as the woods closed in. Once, as I walked back, I thought I saw movement in the trees. A shadow shifting. I hurried inside.

A week later, Randy cornered me in the kitchen. ""You hear things about us in town?""

I shook my head, wiping counters. ""No, sir.""

He leaned close. ""They say lies. About how we live. Don't believe it.""

""I don't listen to gossip,"" I said, stepping back.

He nodded but watched me funny. That night, after I left, I couldn't shake it. The next day, Helen pulled me aside while I folded laundry. ""We have money hidden. Don't go looking.""

""Why would I?"" I asked, surprised.

""Just saying. People might think we have nothing, but we do. Buried under stuff.""

It sounded strange, like a warning. I nodded and kept quiet. As I worked, I found more tapes under couches, even in the pantry. Dozens of them. I wondered if the whole family watched together, and the idea made my skin crawl.

One evening, Clarence sat on the porch while I swept it. ""You ever feel alone out here?"" he asked.

""Sometimes,"" I admitted. ""It's quiet.""

He chuckled. ""Quiet is good. Keeps outsiders away.""

But it wasn't always quiet. At times, I'd hear footsteps upstairs when everyone was down. Or a door creak open in an empty room. I checked once, but found nothing. ""Mice,"" Marie said when I mentioned it. ""Old house has them.""

I didn't believe her. The family acted odd around each other too. Helen and her sons shared rooms in ways that seemed too close. Randy and Kenneth argued often, voices rising about money or chores. Once, I overheard Kenneth say to Randy, ""She knows too much. Watch her.""

I pretended not to hear and finished fast that day.

Things got worse. One morning, I arrived to find the front door ajar. Inside, papers scattered like someone searched in a hurry. Irene cleaned it up. ""Wind blew it open,"" she said.

But no wind that day. Clarence looked worried, checking locks. ""Someone's been around. I saw footprints near the barn.""

""What kind?"" I asked.

""Boot marks. Leading to the house, but not away.""

That scared me. The farm felt watched. I started bringing my own lunch, not eating their food. Helen noticed. ""Don't trust us?""

""Just habit,"" I lied.

A few days on, while in the basement fetching jars, I heard scratching. Like fingers on wood. I called out, ""Hello?""

Silence. Then a soft thump. I ran upstairs. ""Something's down there,"" I told Marie.

She laughed. ""Imagination. Go back to work.""

But I couldn't. That night, I dreamed of eyes peering from the woods. The next week, Randy disappeared for hours, coming back with dirt on his hands. ""Digging,"" he said.

""For what?""

""None of your business.""

Tension built. The family whispered more, glancing at me. Clarence found a rifle missing from the shed. ""Who took it?"" he demanded at supper.

No one answered. Irene looked at Helen. ""Maybe that boy from town. The one who helps sometimes.""

I knew she meant Chris, a young man who came by occasionally for odd jobs. He and Randy talked business, something about cars or money. Chris seemed nice, but uneasy around them.

One day, Chris pulled me aside outside. ""You shouldn't stay here. This family... they're not right.""

""What do you mean?"" I whispered.

""Rumors. About how they live. And money hidden. Someone might come looking.""

""Who?""

He shook his head. ""Just leave. I am.""

He stopped coming after that. I should have too. But I needed the pay. Then, one afternoon, I found a note on the kitchen table. Scrawled words: ""Get out before it's too late.""

No one admitted writing it. That did it. I told Irene, ""I'm done. This place gives me bad feelings.""

She sighed. ""Suit yourself. We'll find another.""

I left that day, never went back. Months passed. I moved on to a job in town. Then, word spread. The Kunz family—dead. Shot in the head, execution style, right in the house. Clarence, Irene, Marie, Randy. Helen missing at first, then found in a creek, same way.

Police said the house was torn apart, like a search for cash. They questioned Chris, even charged him with taking Helen, but not the killings. No one knows who did it for sure.

I think about it often. Those whispers, the shadows, the hidden things. Was someone living nearby, waiting? Listening? I check my locks now, wonder if eyes watch from the dark. The farm still stands empty, but I bet secrets linger there.",1,1768649681.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False
1qfb020,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qfb020/how_to_get_a_smile_that_makes_people_actually/,How to Get a Smile That Makes People ACTUALLY Want to Talk to You The Psychology Behind Magnetic Smiles,"Look I've gone down a rabbit hole studying what makes someone's smile genuinely magnetic versus just fine. And here's what nobody tells you: most advice about smiling is surface level garbage Just smile more Cool thanks for nothing.

After digging through psychology research, dental science, body language studies and interviewing people about what actually draws them to someone, I realized the attractive smile thing is way more nuanced than white teeth and good genes. There's actual science behind why some smiles make you lean in and others make you want to look away. Let's break down what actually works.

# Step 1: Fix the Fundamentals Yeah Boring But Necessary

Before we get into the sexy stuff, you gotta handle basics. A smile that's hiding behind crusty lips or coffee stained teeth isn't doing you any favors. Here's the no BS starter pack

**Oral hygiene matters more than you think.** Not just for your teeth, but your confidence. When you know your breath is fresh and your teeth are clean, you smile differently. Less hesitant. More open. Get an electric toothbrush Oral B or Sonicare doesn't matter which, floss daily yeah actually do it and use a tongue scraper. That last one is a game changer most people skip.

**Hydration is your secret weapon.** Dry mouth = less saliva = bacteria party = bad breath = you don't smile as much. Drink more water. Sounds dumb but it works.

**Lip care is not optional.** Cracked peeling lips kill the vibe. Get a decent lip balm (Aquaphor or Burt's Bees work fine and use it. If your lips look healthy your whole smile looks better.

**Teeth whitening but smart about it.** You don't need Hollywood veneers. Most people just need to remove surface stains. Try whitening strips Crest 3D White works or those purple toothpastes that neutralize yellow tones. But here's the thing, research shows that super white teeth can actually look fake and off putting. Natural white is the goal.

# Step 2: Understand Smile Mechanics The Duchenne Difference

This is where it gets interesting. There are two types of smiles: real ones and fake ones. Your brain can tell the difference in milliseconds, even if you can't consciously explain why.

A Duchenne smile (named after some French neurologist) is a genuine smile. It involves your mouth AND your eyes. The muscles around your eyes crinkle crow's feet appear your cheeks lift, and your whole face lights up. This is what people mean when they say someone has a ""warm smile.""

A fake smile only uses mouth muscles. No eye involvement. It looks forced, awkward, and makes people uncomfortable. You've seen this at every corporate meeting ever.

Here's the trick: You can't really fake a Duchenne smile by just moving your face muscles. You have to actually feel something positive. Think of something funny, recall a happy memory, or focus on something you genuinely appreciate about the person you're talking to. Sounds cheesy but it works. Your face will respond authentically.

Pro tip from body language research if you want to practice, look in a mirror and smile while thinking of nothing. Then smile while thinking of your favorite memory. Watch what your eyes do differently. That's the difference.

# Step 3: Timing Beats Technique

Nobody talks about this enough. When you smile matters more than how perfect your teeth are.

Research on first impressions shows that people who smile too quickly like immediately upon meeting someone can come across as insincere or try hard. People who never smile seem cold and unapproachable. The sweet spot? A slight delay.

When you meet someone, make eye contact first. Hold it for a second. Then let the smile spread across your face naturally, like you just realized something you like about them. This reads as genuine interest rather than automatic politeness.

Vanessa Van Edwards breaks this down perfectly in her book Captivate (she runs a human behavior lab and has analyzed thousands of hours of social interactions). She found that the most charismatic people in her studies had what she calls a slow smile it takes a full second or two to fully form. This signals authenticity because fake smiles happen instantly.

# Step 4: Asymmetry is Your Friend Stop Trying to Be Perfect

Here's something weird: perfectly symmetrical smiles can actually look less attractive than slightly asymmetrical ones. There's research backing this up in evolutionary psychology journals. Slight imperfections signal authenticity.

A little smirk, one side of your mouth lifting slightly before the other, a subtle quirk, these things add character and personality to your smile. They make you memorable. Think about people with iconic smiles (think actors, musicians, people you know personally who have magnetic energy). Most of them have some asymmetry or unique element.

Stop trying to have a perfect smile. Focus on having an authentic expressive one.

# Step 5: The Context Game Read the Room

An attractive smile isn't just about your face. It's about matching energy with the situation. Smiling huge at a funeral? Weird. Not smiling at all at a party? Also weird.

Social calibration matters. Match the intensity of your smile to the context:

* Professional settings: Warm but controlled. Closed mouth smile or slight teeth showing. Confident approachable.
* Social settings: More open, relaxed. Full smile with teeth. Genuine enjoyment.
* Flirty contexts: Playful, with good eye contact. A little mystery. Not a full cheese smile, more of a knowing grin.

Paul Ekman's research on facial expressions (the guy who basically created the science of reading emotions from faces) shows that people trust you more when your facial expressions match the emotional context. Mismatched expressions trigger an unconscious ""something's off"" feeling.

# Step 6: Fix Your Posture (Yes, This Affects Your Smile)

Your smile doesn't exist in isolation. If you're hunched over like a question mark, even the best smile looks defeated. Stand up straight, pull your shoulders back, lift your chin slightly. Now smile.

Notice the difference? Your smile has more energy, more presence. Research on embodied cognition shows that your physical posture actually affects your emotional state and how others perceive your expressions.

Amy Cuddy's work (yeah, the TED talk lady) on power poses found that body position affects not just how others see you but how you feel internally. When you stand confidently, your smile naturally becomes more confident too.

# Step 7: Practice in Low Stakes Situations

You know how your smile feels awkward and forced when you're nervous or trying too hard? That's because you're in your head about it. The fix is exposure therapy, basically.

Practice smiling at random people in low-pressure situations: the barista making your coffee, someone passing by on a walk, the cashier at the grocery store. No agenda, no expectations. Just practice being someone who smiles easily and naturally.

Over time, this becomes automatic. Your brain stops treating smiling as this high-stakes performance and starts seeing it as just. something you do.

# Step 8: Stop Hiding Behind Your Smile

Here's some real shit: the least attractive smiles are ones that feel like masks. People smile to hide discomfort, sadness, or awkwardness all the time. And others can sense it.

If you're not genuinely happy or comfortable, you don't have to fake a big smile. A subtle, honest expression of whatever you're actually feeling reads as more attractive than a forced grin. Authenticity beats performance every single time.

Brené Brown talks about this in The Gifts of Imperfection, vulnerability and realness are what create genuine connection, not performing happiness you don't feel.

# Resources That Actually Help

[Jaws The Story of a Hidden Epidemic](https://www.amazon.in/Jaws-Hidden-Epidemic-Paul-Ehrlich/dp/1503604136) by Sandra Kahn and Paul Ehrlich digs into how modern lifestyle affects jaw development, breathing, and facial aesthetics. Sounds random but it explains why some people naturally have more attractive smiles based on oral posture and breathing patterns. Mind blowing stuff.

The Definitive Book of Body Language by Allan and Barbara Pease has a whole section on smiling and facial expressions that breaks down what works and why. Super practical, based on research, not just opinions.

[BeFreed](http://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is an AI powered learning app that turns book summaries, research papers, and expert talks into personalized podcasts with adaptive learning plans. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts, it pulls from high-quality sources to create content tailored to your goals. You can adjust the length 10 minute summaries or 40 minute deep dives with examples) and customize the voice to match your mood, whether that's something energetic for your commute or calming before bed. The app also includes Freedia, a virtual coach you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get deeper explanations mid-podcast. It helps structure your learning around what you actually want to improve, making it easier to internalize insights from books like the ones mentioned here without the usual information overload.

For fixing dental stuff without breaking the bank, try the app Smile Direct Club or Byte for at-home aligners if your teeth are slightly crooked. Way cheaper than traditional braces and actually works for minor corrections.

And honestly? Just start paying attention to people whose smiles you find attractive. Notice what they do differently. Notice the timing, the authenticity, the context. You'll learn more from observation than from any guide.

# The Real Secret

An attractive smile isn't about perfection. It's about being someone who's genuinely comfortable in their own skin, who finds real joy in moments, and who isn't afraid to show it. Fix the basics understand the mechanics but most importantly work on becoming someone who has real reasons to smile.

The most magnetic people aren't the ones with the whitest teeth or the most symmetrical faces. They're the ones who smile because they're actually engaged, present and finding something worth smiling about in the moment.

1qfay68,https://i.redd.it/v0uyecezawdg1.jpeg,Lattafa Khamrah Qawha Review,"Fragrance Notes (according to fragrantica)

Top Notes: Cardamom, Cinnamon, Ginger 

Middle Notes: Praline, Candied Fruit, White Flowers

Base Notes: Vanilla, Coffee, Tonka Bean, Benzoin, Musk

On the first spray, like some lattafa fragrances in my experience, i seem to smell the base notes straight away in the opening with the other notes coming in like touches on the top that seems to make the fragrance more smooth and adds a hint of complexity to it. On the dry down you get a very boozy and vanilla scent. (or like many fragrance influencers like to say it smells like a christmas candle which is totally correct.) 

It’s very winter/fall weather kind of fragrance. It will perform and smell the best in cooler weather as it’s very vanilla, cinnamon and tonka bean heavy. 

The coffee bean note is very light and just a touch on top giving the fragrance a more interesting and imo a more versatile hint to it. Just a warning it will not smell like the traditional kind of coffee scent.

The presentation is amazing with a better box then most niche and designers and a nicer bottle then nearly all designer fragrances. May take up too much space if you have a big collection.

I wouldn’t say this fragrance is blind but safe as a lot of my friends say it smells very different to what i smell it to be like. The cinnamon may be too in your face to some people as well so if you are unsure, go to the store and try it ON SKIN not tester strip. If you can’t find a store then go online and get a decant of it but really it’s $50AUD you can’t really go wrong and if you really don’t like it, you can resell it for about $20 or so.

Projection is really good as in like room filling and the sillage is alright staying in the room about a minute or so after you leave. Unlike many fragrances i don’t see this one to be changing a lot after application maybe just abit on the dry down. Longevity im definitely getting 12+ hours on it.

I’ve heard people say the OG is a dupe of Killian’s Angel Share so i had to go and try it. From the khamrah qawha i’m getting about a scent 80% similar which is great for the price. You get the same booziness and sweetness but Killians Angel Share is just slight more smooth and higher quality.

Overall was a great purchase. Not blind but safe. Quite high quality definitely for the price. Worth it if you like the scent after trying. Can’t go wrong.

Hope this helps🤞Feel free to comment your opinion below and definitely ask questions if you have any. I’ll be more than happy to answer them.",1,1768649492.0,fragranceclones,0,0.67,False

1qfaxnq,https://i.redd.it/zxypo5kuawdg1.jpeg,Planning an Araku and Jindhagada trek trip this Republic Day long weekend - anyone want to join?,"A few of us are planning a short trip from Hyderabad to Araku and Jindhagada over the Republic Day long weekend and thought I’d post here again in case anyone else was looking to do something similar.

We’re planning to leave on Friday evening (23rd Jan) at 7pm after work and return by Tuesday morning by 9am, so it works nicely without taking extra leave.

The plan is to spend time in Araku — exploring nearby places like Borra Caves, viewpoints, coffee plantations and just slowing down a bit.

After that, we’ll head for the Jindhagada trek (highest peak in AP) and camp there for a night. It’s a 16kms trek and of 5540 ft. If the weather cooperates, there might be some stargazing and cloud views from the top.

It’s a small group plan (around 10–15 people), travelling together in a luxury mini van. We have last 5 slots available. 

Cost works out to about 15.5k per person, covering travel, stay, food, trek, camping, guide and permits- basically everything other than personal expense. 

If you’re already planning something around Araku or are interested in joining, feel free to comment here or DM me and we can connect.

Also I'm posting this on a throw away account due to the individual I'd be mentioning also uses Reddit.



I'm a Poly 22 y/o Male and I'm dating a 46 y/o Male John (fake name) who has a boyfriend Greg (fake name) 33 y/o Male. They've been together for 11 years and have an open relationship. John and I have been dating for 3 years, this will be our fourth year. I don't date Greg but him and I have gotten to become really close friends due to me dating his bf. John and I also see other people and we talk to each other about various guys we like, go on dates with or mess around with. He's somewhat reserved so I tend to be the one to push I'm out his comfort zone ever so often and would encourage him to talk to guys he likes or push him to make a move. And I genuinely feel like it's a victory for me as well when he tells me he's talking to XYZ guy and things go well.

Last year him and I had a discussion were I voiced that I felt hurt when he tells me about dates with other people but when him and I haven't been going on dates. For context him and I would've gone out with friends or hangout at him and his boyfriend's apartment. I'm a romantic person and like a lot of one on one time but I also don't just want to do the same thing we do all the time. So I was feeling a bit neglected and jealous but I knew why. It had nothing to do with the people he went one dates with but the fact they were people he met for a short period of time getting dates with him and I've been dating him for 3 years and we haven't gone on a date by ourselves for almost all of 2025 because we'd mostly stay it the apartment and watch TV. Which I enjoy but it got to a point of stagnation but I digress.

He listened to me he understood how I felt and we've gone on quite a few dates since and if we can't do actual dates we've had check-ins over coffee since that conversation, which was around August last year till now. Last Saturday evening we were watching YouTube before him and I got ready to go to the movies (movie date) together and he was catching me up about a guy we both like. John had a sexual encounter with the guy and so he wanted to playfully ""show off"" but also light a fire under my ass to make progression with the guy myself and give me an idea of what to expect so to speak. So he's telling me about the encounter and for a quick moment jealousy snapped into my brain. Not because of him getting with the guy because I fully supported them however the issue is the encounter itself. It was a wild spur of the moment thing in the car he explained as he was telling me about the night. I had a pit in my stomach feeling similarly to the time told me he had a foursome a lot of years back. John has a wild side that I hardly if ever get to experience and I want to get to experience that side of him too.

Granted I'm THEE wild one of the two of us while he has to be caught in the right moment at the right time. That's just who he is (again he's reserved a great deal of the time) and I know this because him and I have had some wild moments but never anything grandeur like what I'd like to have with him. I want to have those/similar experiences with him as well. I know why I'm jealous but my issue is that I know my reasoning is valid. However there's a part of me that's feeling guilt that's actively trying to suppress everything and feed me false narratives of ""maybe he doesn't wanna do that with you or rather do those things with other people"". Which is silly because he's never told me or showed me that's the case and util he says that, then my assumptions aren't confirmations. So in a scenario such as this how I can sperate the rational from the irrational from a poly perspective? What're some ways I can start the conversation of me expressing these feelings/desires to him?",0,1768649324.0,relationships,3,0.2,False

The next morning we were both in the kitchen making coffee. I stood there longer than I needed to.

I took JSN's Reception at 6+ (-125) and I think he easily catches 7 passes from Darnold. This is a divisional postseason game and JSN has been his favorite target throughout this season. Darnold has had a disappointing postseason last year wit the Vikes, but he has been shining in spot where most have criticized him for. Many were criticizing Darnold for not showing up for the big game or not beating his kryptonite, the Rams. Well, he's proven that in his last 3 regular season games. Despite not winning a postseason game, he's won the division and the outright #1 Seed in the NFC for the Seahawks in the last regular season game against the Niners and finally handed the Rams a L on Week 16. So I expect Darnold to show up and target dimes to JSN.

**Niners are also 2nd in the league to allow receptions this season and JSN is 4th in the league on receptions. It's a match made heaven**, a defensive team that gives up 2nd most receptions vs a receiver who has the 4th most receptions. Plus, Darnold will not be haunted by Nick Bosa or Fred Warner in this game. Against a depleted Niners defense, gimme JSN to get 7+ Rec in this divisional game.

[JSN might not have hit this mark on the last regular season game against the Niners, but in a big game where the Niners are depleted wit key defensive pieces out and allowing 2nd most receptions against the 4th most rec. receiver, 7 rec. should be easy for JSN!](https://preview.redd.it/84l07f1s8wdg1.png?width=849&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b94fc842351c3d3915b52b549befa6484cf8f75)

**Lastly JSN has had 7 or more receptions in 4 of his last 5 games (and 10 of his last 13 games).**

**The Play & Prediction :** I would go 1.25U but since this isn't my favorite bet on the board I'm going just 1U play on JSN 7+ Rec to win 0.8U. JSN covers this line in the first half.

1qfauel,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDparenting/comments/1qfauel/i_finally_figured_out_why_i_was_punishing_myself/,I finally figured out why I was punishing myself for ADHD struggles (and how I stopped). Long post but might help someone,"I saw the post yesterday about the psychiatrist telling someone to reward themselves instead of punishing themselves for ADHD struggles.

It hit me hard.

For 10 years, I’ve told myself: “Why would I reward myself for barely getting something done? That’s what I’m SUPPOSED to do.”

Turns out, I wasn’t holding myself accountable. I was being cruel to a disabled brain. We don’t procrastinate because we’re lazy.

ADHD brains don’t produce dopamine without urgency.

	∙	ADHD = low baseline dopamine

	∙	Deadline/crisis = adrenaline surge

	∙	Adrenaline = temporary dopamine boost

	∙	Brain learns: Crisis = only way to function

We become addicted to our own stress hormones.

Then crash. Then punish ourselves for needing the crisis. The cycle:

Crisis → Hyperfocus → Finish → Crash → Guilt → Punishment → Repeat What changed for me:

After my third burnout, I stopped asking “Why can’t I be normal?”

I asked: “What does MY brain actually need?”

I mapped the pattern. It happens in 5 stages:

	1.	High Energy (saying yes to everything)

	2.	Overwhelm (panic setting in)

	3.	Chronic Stress (constantly anxious)

	4.	The Wall (body shutting down)

	5.	The Crash (complete collapse)

The key: Catch it at Stage 2, not Stage 5. What actually helps:

Track warning signs:

	∙	Sleeping <6 hours

	∙	Coffee replacing food

	∙	Avoiding messages

	∙	Everything feels urgent

	∙	Can’t make decisions

3+ signs = reduce load NOW

Create sustainable urgency:

	∙	Body doubling (Focusmate, coffee shops)

	∙	Micro-deadlines (break big deadline into tiny ones)

	∙	2-minute start (just begin for 2 minutes)

Reward the effort:

Your brain needs to learn: task = dopamine

Not “you deserve it.” It’s brain chemistry. 

Why I’m sharing: I spent months after my last burnout mapping all of this out. What actually worked. What the stages looked like. How to catch it early.

I turned it into a guide, a complete framework—all 5 stages, sustainable urgency toolkit, early warning system, what to do when you’re crashing.

It’s called “Breaking the Crisis Spiral.”

1qfata2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfata2,I did it! FC and 25 days in the mine,"Welp, I did it.   When I burnt out months ago I did not think returning to achievement hunt was going to be much more than a renewed yet passing interest, but its restored my love for the game.   I first did Faithful Cartographer,  which went along nicely with a nomadic tour of Great Bear (although I'm a bit sad the far territories are not included, perhaps I'll map them anyways!).  I established a few more satellite bases along the journey, taking a little time to build furniture and small caches in locations I hadn't previously.

But then came the 25 days in Langston Mine challenge (Too Greedily, Too Deep).   I had only done a small bit of research on the feat as I didn't want to simply be following a ""how to"" guide.  My present save file does not have the settled mind perk, so this was done using the harvest / quit harvest trick for passing time.

Honestly?  I vastly over prepped.  I made approx. 90 rose hip pies, 70 birch bark teas, 30 Coffees, and had about 20 stims. I used approx. 1.5 L of lanterns fuel just moving stuff around and setting up and occasionally needing to access something in the space. I gathered some wood and coal nearby to the miner's footpath entrance, which once you enter its just a short rope climb down to a room with a fire barrel, which is where I spent all my time.  I killed the bear and two deer that are in the general area, and had pockets full of cured meat as well.  I never lost my well fed bonus, and I never dropped below 80% health. Once I got the achievement I stuffed my face with the remaining rose hip pies and walked on out with a song in my heart, a skip in my step, and a full fatigue meter and straight back to my transfer pass base.  

It was boring for sure.  I accidentally all the way harvested a miner's flashlight but other than that is was about 3 ish real life hours of micromanaging my various health stats and trying not to fully harvest my axe too.  I had already previously explored just about every nook and cranny of the mine so I didnt bother moving from my room set up on this occasion.

Currently taking suggestions for what I should do next!

1qfat6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/UlcerativeColitis/comments/1qfat6t/gi_rant/,GI rant,"Hi there, I just wanted to vent a little about GI professionals, I just wonder why is such an opinionated topic. It's as if every GI professional out there has a different opinion of what this deceased is or how it works. For example:


I have had tons of GI tell me that food has nothing to do with this. Duh, of course it does! Then some of them tell you to just follow a ""Mediterranean"" diet like chicken and salads, and it's not just that! There are tons of other foods that can irritate your gut, I asked a one if I could keep drinking coffee and they were like ""yeah sure!"" when coffee, for me, is the #1 culprit of my flares.


They dismiss the pain. This is what irritates me the most. A year ago I had a few really bad flares, the pain was so intense that if I was out I'd have to find a bench to sit for a while until the pain went away. I went days without eating because I'd get in pain as soon as I finished eating something.  Then when I go to the ER they touch you and they are like ""Are you sure you are really hurting? I don't feel anything here, it doesn't hurt when I touch, right?""


They get frustrated because their 2, 3 generic solutions don't work. I recently changed GI because she was getting noticeable frustrated when the meds wouldn't work and wants to escalate immediately. I have always been with 4g oral mesalasine. This person added a 1g suppository when that wasn't working. Then mesalasine enemas. Then corticoids. Then wanted to bump to immunosuppressants. I stopped with the corticoids, after the last round of corticoids I have been doing just fine with mesalasine, an strict diet, and exercise. I did change GI ans I'll see what the next one says about immunosupressants. But I'd appreciate if GI professionals would try to personalize treatment for each patient instead of rushing these generic solutions and escalating when something doesn't work.

The research. Sometimes it feels like ppl with UC is more up to date with treatments and stuff than the actual GI!

1qfar9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/BinocularVision/comments/1qfar9n/have_been_struggling_with_dizziness_and_tinnitus/,Have been struggling with dizziness and tinnitus,"Hey all. I've been struggling for about four months with a weird type of dizziness that definitely has something to do with my eyes, increased and highly variable tinnitus, and some right ear fullness. Various things have been ruled out by an ENT, specialist physios etc. the dizziness in particular improved a lot while I was home for four weeks over Christmas, but returned with a vengeance when I went back to work this week. Half an hour after sitting at my desk (using a computer) all the symptoms were back - dizziness, tight head, fuzziness, tingling around my right eye, tinnitus up (that evening). I swapped out my progressive lenses for my old straight lenses which helped a little, but it's still not great. 

After everything else I've tried, I made an appointment with my optometrist and saw him this morning. He checked my prescriptions and they're still good.  He did a few tests and found that my right eye takes some time to align with the left eye - it starts out unaligned and gradually drags it back. Said that if I was a kid he'd start me on exercises and if I was older (I'm 52) he'd prescribe prisms. He didn't use the term BVD, but this is what he's talking about right? 

What he didn't do is match the symptoms I'm experiencing to the BVD(if that's what it is). 

With the dizziness, it's often where I'm looking a something at arms length and constantly readjusting - say I'm looking from one monitor to another or looking at a persons face and they're moving or I'm moving. Or I'm moving around and looking at stuff - washing up or making coffee and steaming milk, etc. If I'm having an episode looking down at an iPad reading an flicking up and down to look at the tv and the like can also trigger the feeling. 

Does this sound legit? I wonder if I should make an appointment to go back and discuss my concerns and the possibility of VT. Thoughts?",1,1768648829.0,BinocularVision,0,1.0,False

1qfaoif,https://www.reddit.com/r/SRPESupport/comments/1qfaoif/my_new_routine_tamp_inflammation_blitz_histamine/,"My new routine - tamp inflammation, blitz histamine, manage cortisol, avoid caffeine","Had an utter funk leading up to Xmas - six weeks of diminished sleep, various horrors. A range of potions and sleepers to compensate: leading to yet more issues. Total dysregulation: fear of and obsession-with sleep. 

In my own case, I have long realised that histamine is the key trigger. Histamine lightens sleep, builds inflammation. 

In the end, I got so fed up after Xmas that I decided to pull a big lever: give up caffeine altogether. 

This was very tough initially, but three weeks into this new mode, my biorhythm has settled into something much more chill. I take on less stress during the day, and somehow this bleeds into the night time. Also stopped vaping, which I think was inflaming my throat. 

  
I have now stacked four things: Ashwaganda; promethazine (an antihistamine normally prescribed as a sleeper; it is sedating - in other words, it is designed to cross the blood-brain barrier); chelated magnesium, and, I think crucially, 400mg of ibuprofen. 

  
I have slept very well since the turn of 2026, and it has been sort of life-changing: to know that it wasn't all in my head; yes, this disease had big, life-altering effects. The first protracted period of deep sleep since I came off the SSRIs I was prescribed as a 'cure' (not worth the side effects, imo).

  
Baclofen has historically been unsustainable. Two nights of great sleep, fully restorative, before the riptide of GABA rebound pulls me out of phase and causes more issues. 

  
Here is a breakdown of the stack. 

**Antihistamine:** reduces histamine. Promethazine seems to work better for me that cetrizine or loratadine of fexofenadine. Cetrizine tended to result in a drugged feeling sleep. Loratadine and fexo tended to have only partial effects. Promethazine is marketed as a sleeping agent, and requires consulting a chemist in my country. 

**Magnesium, chelated:** highly absorbable version of this essential mineral for sleep and muscle relaxation. Not sure whether this is crucial, but it can't hurt. 

**Ibuprofen:** the classic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory turns out to be literally the strongest inflammation-reducer you can get without visiting a doctor. The dose for inflammation-reduction is higher than that for pain relief. 400mg is a high pain-relief dose, but only moderate for anti-inflammation. I would be within my rights to take 800mg, but 400 works, and the long-term issues with 800 would be greater: it is harsh on the stomach, can cause kidney problems in the long-term, and gastric ones in the medium term: needs to be taken with food. 

  
**Ashwaganda:** adaptogen, helping the body transition through stress. Regulates cortisol. Also a mild gabanergic, which feels tolerable and helps in  the same way baclofen or zopiclone might. I was reminded of this substance by a friend who swore it had cured her sleep. I recalled that it had once been very good for mine. So far, no side effects, but it is a strong substance given its over-the-counter supplement classification, with possible allergenic overtones for some, so seek further advice before you jump in. 

Overall, if I have to think about my life and why this works: 

1. I have probably been suffering from chronic stress for years. An inability to turn off. When I think about when all this began, it was during a period of immense stress in 2018, when, rather than lean back and take my foot off the gas, I endlessly doubled down. 

It's a folk theory, but: some research suggests that perhaps my sympathetic nervous system (fight or flight) has simply been clamped in the 'on' position: in other words, I have continued to produce adrenaline and stress hormones even late into the night, sensitising my sleep.  

2. I am probably quite sensitive to caffeine. I am sensitive to most things, hence why I have never been able to build equilibrium with baclofen: people who say they regularly take 40mg doses scare me. Above 5mg I get instant CNS depression and then strong rebound. 

The half-life of coffee, has probably kept my sympathetic nervous system rotating sufficienltt into the night. I was on about 4 cups a day, normally not after 2PM, so not massive, but definitely real. 

3. Histamine sensitivity. I have a lot of issues with histamine. I have eczema, hives, and occasional hayfever. Coffee is bad for histamine release. So are lots of things: aged cheeses, smoked meats, leftovers, kefir, eggplant, wine and beer. Histamine controls several things, from sleep to erections, to inflammation, to gastric acid. The basic theory is that nighttime histamine overload directly messes with REM, while simultaneously messing with the erectile mechanism. 

As with many here, antihistamines have historically provided a temporary cure. I was surprised to find that promethazine was more effective, as I have always assumed that a H1 histamine reducer was not what I was after. (H1 is to do with sleep; H2 to do with 'smooth muscle relaxation', which is in part the erectile mechanism; H3 and H4 play a role in inflammation and allergy). 

4. Linked to 3 - histamine sensitivity is elevating my immune system response. The immune system throwing a fit has led to chronic inflammation. This then boosts cortisol, which is the body's natural coping mechanism for stress, but disrupts sleep. Chronic cortisol elevation is very tiring (classic 'tired but wired' feeling) and ultimately leads to a chronic cycle of inflammation. Historically, I have used vast amounts of exercise to tamp down my symptoms: running especially is a great inflammation-reducer, temporarily. 

  
5. I have been quite good at getting up at the same time every day. For those already disrupted, this is every sleep expert's number 1 tip for regulating your biorhythms. I have also banished blue light - all my devices default to warm tones at all times of the day. 

In time, I'd hope to reduce this stack - both promethazine and ibuprofen will have kick back, long term. But the plan is that I get myself fully stabilised, kick the cycle, before I kick away the bolsters gradually. 

  
From reading around these forums, I see that many people have quite different starting points for the same issue. Some seem more physical, some are to do with histamine, others are about different neurotransmission. This has worked for me. But it might not be right for all. Please take this as one man's polypharmacy auto-experiment, which may leave clues for others. 

Anyway, a hopeful story. Keep fighting - we are all in a brutal yet somewhat embarrassing war for control of our sanity.

I'm a Poly 22 y/o Male and I'm dating a 46 y/o Male John (fake name) who has a boyfriend Greg (fake name). They've been together for 11 years and have an open relationship. John and I have been dating for 3 years, this will be our fourth year. I don't date Greg but him and I have gotten to become really close friends due to me dating his bf. John and I also see other people and we talk to each other about various guys we like, go on dates with or mess around with. He's somewhat reserved so I tend to be the one to push I'm out his comfort zone ever so often and would encourage him to talk to guys he likes or push him to make a move. And I genuinely feel like it's a victory for me as well when he tells me he's talking to XYZ guy and things go well.

Last year him and I had a discussion were I voiced that I felt hurt when he tells me about dates with other people but when him and I haven't been going on dates. For context him and I would've gone out with friends or hangout at him and his boyfriend's apartment. I'm a romantic person and like a lot of one on one time but I also don't just want to do the same thing we do all the time. So I was feeling a bit neglected and jealous but I knew why. It had nothing to do with the people he went one dates with but the fact they were people he met for a short period of time getting dates with him and I've been dating him for 3 years and we haven't gone on a date by ourselves for almost all of 2025 because we'd mostly stay it the apartment and watch TV. Which I enjoy but it got to a point of stagnation but I digress.

He listened to me he understood how I felt and we've gone on quite a few dates since and if we can't do actual dates we've had check-ins over coffee since that conversation, which was around August last year till now. Last Saturday evening we were watching YouTube before him and I got ready to go to the movies (movie date) together and he was catching me up about a guy we both like. John had a sexual encounter with the guy and so he wanted to playfully ""show off"" but also light a fire under my ass to make progression with the guy myself and give me an idea of what to expect so to speak. So he's telling me about the encounter and for a quick moment jealousy snapped into my brain. Not because of him getting with the guy because I fully supported them however the issue is the encounter itself. It was a wild spur of the moment thing in the car he explained as he was telling me about the night. I had a pit in my stomach feeling similarly to the time told me he had a foursome a lot of years back. John has a wild side that I hardly if ever get to experience and I want to get to experience that side of him too.

Granted I'm THEE wild one of the two of us while he has to be caught in the right moment at the right time. That's just who he is (again he's reserved a great deal of the time) and I know this because him and I have had some wild moments but never anything grandeur like what I'd like to have with him. I want to have those/similar experiences with him as well. I know why I'm jealous but my issue is that I know my reasoning is valid. However there's a part of me that's feeling guilt that's actively trying to suppress everything and feed me false narratives of ""maybe he doesn't wanna do that with you or rather do those things with other people"". Which is silly because he's never told me or showed me that's the case and util he says that, then my assumptions aren't confirmations. So in a scenario such as this how I can sperate the rational from the irrational from a poly perspective? What're some ways I can start the conversation of me expressing these feelings/desires to him?",1,1768648545.0,nonmonogamy,3,1.0,False

The first time I should have died, I didn’t have the courtesy to recognize it as anything dramatic. No premonition. No slow-motion montage. Just a Tuesday that already felt slightly cursed—bad coffee, a thin ringing in my left ear, and a four o’clock dentist appointment where I planned to nod through the floss lecture like a man taking communion.

The sky was the kind that makes you suspicious if you’re paying attention. Too clean for April. Too bright, like someone had polished the whole dome overhead until the blue looked manufactured. Even the clouds seemed trimmed and placed on purpose, each one crisp along the edges, as if a careless hand hadn’t been allowed near the canvas.

I drove the route I always drove: past the strip mall with the vape shop and the discount mattress place, past the little church where the crooked LED sign blinked JESUS like it was stuttering. My phone buzzed once in the cupholder—Mom’s name flashed—then went quiet again. I didn’t pick it up. I never did while driving. I told myself that meant I was responsible.

At the light by the feed store, I rolled to the front of the line. A semi idled in the lane to my left, a wall of metal and height that blocked half the world, and even through closed windows I could smell the diesel, sour and heavy, like something old breathing beside me.

The light turned green.

I went, because green means go and I’m not the kind of person who treats driving like a philosophy problem.

*That’s when the rules cracked.*

From the right, a black SUV came at me as if it had been kicked into motion. I caught the driver’s face for a fraction of a second—pale, mouth open, eyes aimed past me instead of at me, like he’d already left the moment and his body was only finishing what he’d started.

No horn. No squeal of brakes. Not even the chance for anger.

Just one clean, weirdly calm thought: *Oh. That’s it.*

Impact wasn’t a sound so much as pressure—like a massive hand closing around my chest. The steering wheel jumped into me. The windshield flashed white and broke into a storm of glittering fragments. My head snapped back and forward hard enough that my teeth clicked together.

And then—

I was still driving through the intersection.

Green light. Smooth pavement. The semi still rumbling alongside me, exactly where it had been.

My mouth opened for a scream, but my lungs didn’t cooperate at first, as if they hadn’t gotten the memo. My heart hammered so violently I tasted copper.

I looked to the right.

The SUV was there, but it was stopped perfectly at the red light like a model citizen, hands at ten and two, face blank, gaze fixed forward. Like it had never been anything else.

I went past him with my whole body buzzing like a power line in the rain. In the mirror, he stayed put. The light stayed red. The world acted offended by my confusion.

By the time I pulled into the dentist’s parking lot, my hands were slick on the wheel and my shirt clung to my ribs. I just sat there with my forehead pressed against the steering wheel, breathing in shallow, ugly pulls, trying to convince myself I’d had a momentary lapse—some nasty little brain trick.

Near-miss hallucination. Stress. A daydream with teeth.

Except my chest still ached, not like soreness, not like bruising. It hurt the way a muscle hurts after it’s been squeezed too hard and then let go, like fingertips had pressed into me and left a memory behind.

Inside, the receptionist smiled and said, “Hey, *Mark*—running right on time.”

I froze with my hand hovering over the clipboard.

*Mark wasn’t my name.*

I gave her my real name—no, I’m not putting it here; it’s mine—and she blinked, then did a quick laugh like she’d made an innocent mistake. “Oh my God, I’m sorry. You look like a Mark I know.”

Plausible. Everything was plausible if you swallowed it fast enough.

The cleaning itself was normal in that particular way dentistry always is—bright lamp, cold tools, the hygienist’s careful chatter while she scraped at the places I always missed. On the wall-mounted TV, daytime news played with the sound off, and I watched the ticker crawl by to give my mind something simple to cling to.

Except the city name in the ticker was spelled wrong. One letter off.

A typo, sure. That’s what it was. It had to be. Still, I stared at it until my eyes watered, and when the hygienist asked if I was okay, I nodded because the alternative was explaining that the world had started mislabeling itself in small, petty ways.

I took side streets home. I avoided major intersections like they were hungry. The whole drive I watched other cars as if any of them might suddenly decide it was time to erase me again.

Scout met me at the door the way he always did—nails skittering on the tile, tail wagging hard enough to throw his hips around. He shoved his nose into my hand, and I knelt to ruffle his ears and pressed my face into his neck because his fur smelled like warm dust and grass and that faint corn-chip odor dogs get between their toes.

Scout had a white blaze on his snout that I’d always called his “kiss mark,” because it looked like a small flame. Like the universe had leaned down and left him a blessing.

Only now it didn’t look like a flame.

It was a line. Straight and narrow. Almost like a scar.

I pulled back and held his head gently between my hands, staring so hard my eyes burned. Scout just gazed up at me with those brown, trusting eyes and licked my chin, unbothered, as if I were the strange one—and maybe I was.

I wandered the house touching things to reassure myself: the chipped coffee mug, the dent in the hallway drywall from when I moved the couch two years ago and got cocky, the framed photo of my parents at Niagara Falls with Dad’s baseball cap tilted and Mom’s smile wide.

Most of it felt right.

But the little things were… off, like the universe had been reassembled by someone who’d done a decent job but didn’t own the original instructions. The fridge magnet that used to say Hawaii now said Maui in big letters, even though I’d never been to Maui. The salt shaker had a blue lid when I was sure it had been red. The spare key on the hook by the door was a different cut on the same ring.

Nothing you could take to court. Nothing you could show a friend without earning a look that says Are you sleeping? Are you using something?

That night I left the lights on.

When I finally fell asleep, I dreamed of the intersection again. In the dream, the SUV hit me over and over, each impact identical—pressure, shatter, darkness—and each time, like a cruel joke, I was back at the green light again with my hands steady on the wheel and the semi beside me and the world pretending it hadn’t just snapped my neck.

The last time, right before impact, I looked at the driver.

It was me behind the wheel, mouth open, eyes aimed past myself, already absent.

I woke up with my tongue bitten and my heart racing.

The next morning I went to work because normal people go to work even when their minds are trying to assemble meaning out of nonsense.

The office was the same fluorescent purgatory: Kevin from accounting chewing ice like it was a sport, Sherry at the front desk wearing that lavender perfume that made my eyes itch. The rhythm of it should’ve soothed me. Instead it made me feel like I was walking through a set that could be taken down at any moment.

I sat at my computer, typed my password.

It failed.

I tried again. Failed.

Annoyed and a little rattled, I clicked through a reset and got hit with a security question:

\`What is the name of your first pet?\`

My first pet had been a cat named Whiskers. I got him when I was seven. He lived fifteen years, died while I was in college, and I’d cried into my hoodie on my dorm bed like a kid who couldn’t pretend he was tough anymore.

I typed \`WHISKERS\`

\`Rejected\`

\`WHISKER\`

\`Rejected\`

A hint appeared. Just one letter:

\`S\`

A slow chill rolled through my stomach. I sat there staring at the screen until the monitor’s glow felt harsh and personal, like it was judging me.

Some part of my brain kept trying to label it as a technical problem—database mismatch, user profile corruption, a dumb glitch that would be funny later. But something older and quieter inside me said: *No. This isn’t the computer. This is you.*

I called the higher-tier IT line—my own department, just not my desk—and a guy named Nolan answered in his usual bored-cheerful voice. I explained the problem. I heard him clicking around in my account.

“Huh,” he said. “Looks like your security answers were updated last month.”

“I didn’t update them.”

“Maybe it happened during the forced reset.”

“No,” I said, sharper than I meant to, and it earned me a small pause on the other end.

“I can see the answer,” Nolan said finally, cautious now. “But I can’t tell you.”

“Then just tell me the first letter.”

He exhaled. “It starts with S. And… it’s a dog.”

My mouth went dry.

“My first pet wasn’t a dog.”

A thin chuckle. “Okay, man. But your file says it was. ‘Sparky.’”

Sparky.

It meant nothing to me and everything to someone else—someone wearing my credentials, living in the shape of my life.

I hung up without saying goodbye.

The rest of the day I moved through the office on autopilot, smiling at jokes, answering emails, doing small normal tasks like a man trying to prove he was real by completing forms. The pressure in my chest didn’t go away; it just settled heavier, like water behind a dam.

I took side streets home again, watching every car too closely. At home, Scout greeted me, tail wagging, the straight white line on his snout as undeniable as a signature.

My phone buzzed. Mom again.

This time I answered.

“Hey,” she said, bright and breathless, the way she gets when she’s already imagining a family scene. “I just wanted to make sure you’re still coming Saturday.”

“For what?” I asked, and I heard the edge in my own voice.

There was a beat of silence that felt like stepping onto a floor you expected to be solid.

“For… your sister’s baby shower.”

I let out a short laugh that didn’t sound like me. “Mom, I don’t have a sister.”

The quiet on the line stretched.

Then she said my name—my name, the one I refuse to hand over—and she said it gently, like she was approaching an injured animal.

“Honey,” she whispered. “Yes you do.”

My skin prickled all over. I suddenly felt nauseous, as if gravity had leaned to one side. I tried to picture my parents with another child. I tried to imagine a sister’s face, her voice, her smell when she hugged me. My mind offered a blank wall.

“Stop,” I said, barely audible.

“What’s wrong? Are you okay?” Her voice cracked.

“I’m tired,” I said, because it was the only lie that didn’t immediately collapse. “I’m just tired.”

“You’ve been working too much,” she said, relief pouring into her words. “Come on Saturday. You’ll feel better when you see everybody.”

“Yeah,” I managed.

When I hung up, I sat in the dim living room with Scout’s warm weight against my leg. The house made its small, ordinary night sounds: the fridge hum, the wall clock ticking, the faint settling creaks in the wood like a body shifting in sleep.

Everything normal.

Everything thin.

I thought about the intersection again, about the impact and then the impossible reset, like a game snapping back to an earlier save point. A rational person would call it a near-miss, the brain running a disaster simulation to keep you safe.

But my body remembered more than a simulation, and the world—these petty little edits—didn’t behave like imagination. It behaved like I’d been moved, not far, just enough to notice.

I went to bed early. No alcohol. No pills. I wanted my mind clear, because if something was wrong I needed to watch it happen without fog.

I lay there in the dark listening to Scout breathe on the floor beside the bed.

After midnight, a sound came from the kitchen.

A soft *click*.

Then another.

Like a fingernail tapping glass.

I held my breath. The air felt thicker than it should’ve, as if it had absorbed humidity and secrets. Another click followed—slow, patient, deliberate.

I slid my hand into the nightstand drawer and found the flashlight and the old baseball bat my dad had given me “just in case.” The bat felt like a child’s idea of protection, but it was better than my bare hands.

The clicking stopped.

For a moment I almost laughed at myself.

Then the smoke detector in the hallway *chirped*—one sharp beep—like it was testing.

I sat up.

Scout rose too, ears forward, a low growl vibrating in his chest.

The detector chirped again.

And again.

Not the battery warning. Not the full alarm. Just a measured, purposeful beep, as if it had something to say.

From the kitchen, a voice spoke—quiet, almost polite.

Not my mother. Not a neighbor. Not the television.

It sounded like someone standing just out of sight with a smile in the dark.

“Mark?” it said.

My blood went cold.

The voice said it like the name belonged to *me*.

And somewhere deep in my mind, like a light flickering at the end of a corridor, a thought surfaced that didn’t feel like mine at all:

*Maybe it does.*",2,1768648402.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Society evolves and just like a dropped handkerchief, we need to admit that certain things don’t work anymore so we can adapt to the current times. 

It’s usually the older generations who understand this concept best and the younger generations who give outdated advice.

It’s also very unhelpful that loudest advice tends to be from those who aren’t dating like the married or those who are fortunate enough to be then top 10% - so they are living life with cheat codes anyways.

There are too many subjects to get into like stopping on the street, run clubs, coffee shop etc  But being on this thread for some time I do want to quickly explain dating apps…

People remember tinder or hinge from like 15 years ago. Before the developers got greedy and society turned it into a circus of egos. There’s so much frustration in curating the best profile because there’s an expectation from the algo not met since 2017! I’ve read countless threads of people being almost promised success from something like a better prompt. Stop that. Make the profile the best it can be, sure, but tell the truth. The apps are dying.

Also, I think it’s healthy in both dating and in life to mention the important of luck. There’s such a market in people’s desperation and sorrow, that many pretend there is no such element to sell a course, product, comfort or to just feed their ego. It is also true that much of these feelings are caused by people who do little to no compounding effort in moving forward in life.  Nevertheless, luck is a crucial element that many professionals would consider it at 50%.",0,1768648383.0,dating_advice,7,0.33,False

I'm a Poly 22 y/o Male and I'm dating a 46 y/o Male John (fake name) who has a boyfriend Greg (fake name). They've been together for 11 years and have an open relationship. John and I have been dating for 3 years, this will be our fourth year. I don't date Greg but him and I have gotten to become really close friends due to me dating his bf. John and I also see other people and we talk to each other about various guys we like, go on dates with or mess around with. He's somewhat reserved so I tend to be the one to push I'm out his comfort zone ever so often and would encourage him to talk to guys he likes or push him to make a move. And I genuinely feel like it's a victory for me as well when he tells me he's talking to XYZ guy and things go well.

Last year him and I had a discussion were I voiced that I felt hurt when he tells me about dates with other people but when him and I haven't been going on dates. For context him and I would've gone out with friends or hangout at him and his boyfriend's apartment. I'm a romantic person and like a lot of one on one time but I also don't just want to do the same thing we do all the time. So I was feeling a bit neglected and jealous but I knew why. It had nothing to do with the people he went one dates with but the fact they were people he met for a short period of time getting dates with him and I've been dating him for 3 years and we haven't gone on a date by ourselves for almost all of 2025 because we'd mostly stay it the apartment and watch TV. Which I enjoy but it got to a point of stagnation but I digress.

He listened to me he understood how I felt and we've gone on quite a few dates since and if we can't do actual dates we've had check-ins over coffee since that conversation, which was around August last year till now. Last Saturday evening we were watching YouTube before him and I got ready to go to the movies (movie date) together and he was catching me up about a guy we both like. John had a sexual encounter with the guy and so he wanted to playfully ""show off"" but also light a fire under my ass to make progression with the guy myself and give me an idea of what to expect so to speak. So he's telling me about the encounter and for a quick moment jealousy snapped into my brain. Not because of him getting with the guy because I fully supported them however the issue is the encounter itself. It was a wild spur of the moment thing in the car he explained as he was telling me about the night. I had a pit in my stomach feeling similarly to the time told me he had a foursome a lot of years back. John has a wild side that I hardly if ever get to experience and I want to get to experience that side of him too.

Granted I'm THEE wild one of the two of us while he has to be caught in the right moment at the right time. That's just who he is (again he's reserved a great deal of the time) and I know this because him and I have had some wild moments but never anything grandeur like what I'd like to have with him. I want to have those/similar experiences with him as well. I know why I'm jealous but my issue is that I know my reasoning is valid. However there's a part of me that's feeling guilt that's actively trying to suppress everything and feed me false narratives of ""maybe he doesn't wanna do that with you or rather do those things with other people"". Which is silly because he's never told me or showed me that's the case and util he says that, then my assumptions aren't confirmations. So in a scenario such as this how I can sperate the rational from the irrational from a poly perspective?

1qfalfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1qfalfv/i_finally_figured_out_why_i_was_punishing_myself/,"I finally figured out why I was punishing myself for ADHD struggles (and how I stopped). Long post, but might help someone.","I saw the post yesterday about the psychiatrist telling someone to reward themselves instead of punishing themselves for ADHD struggles.

It broke something open in me.

For 10 years, I’ve been telling myself: “Why would I reward myself for barely getting something done? That’s what I’m SUPPOSED to do.”

Turns out, I wasn’t holding myself accountable. I was being cruel to a disabled brain. The thing no one tells you:

We don’t procrastinate because we’re lazy.

We procrastinate because our brains literally don’t produce dopamine without urgency. Here’s what’s actually happening:

	∙	ADHD = low baseline dopamine

	∙	Deadline/crisis = adrenaline surge

	∙	Adrenaline = temporary dopamine boost

	∙	Brain learns: Crisis = the only way I can function

So we become addicted to our own stress hormones. Then we crash. Then we punish ourselves for needing the crisis in the first place.

The cycle:

Crisis → Hyperfocus → Barely finish → Crash → Guilt → Self-punishment → Repeat

I’ve been in this spiral for a decade. What changed:

After my third major burnout (couldn’t get out of bed for a week, thought I was going insane), I stopped asking “Why can’t I just be normal?” I started asking: “What does MY brain actually need?”

And I realized something:

I’m not broken. I’m just using the wrong instruction manual. The framework that finally worked was

I noticed the burnout happened in stages. Every single time.

Stage 1: High Energy and Taking on everything, riding the urgency wave Stage 2: Overwhelm, Too much, panic creeping in Stage 3: Chronic Stress, Constantly anxious, ADHD symptoms worse Stage 4: The Wall, Body shutting down, can’t push through anymore Stage 5: The Crash, Complete collapse

Most of us don’t realize we’re spiraling until we hit Stage 5. The breakthrough: What if I could catch it at Stage 2 instead? So I started tracking warning signs. Early warning signs I wish I’d known:

Physical:

	∙	Sleeping less than 6 hours

	∙	Forgetting to eat (or stress-eating constantly)

	∙	Constant headaches or neck pain

	∙	Getting sick more often

Behavioral:

	∙	Saying yes to everything

	∙	Avoiding all messages/emails

	∙	Losing things constantly

	∙	Coffee replacing actual food

Emotional:

	∙	Everything feels urgent (even when it’s not)

	∙	Snapping at people I love

	∙	Guilt about resting

	∙	The thought: “I can’t keep doing this”

Cognitive:

	∙	Can’t make simple decisions

	∙	Brain fog even on meds

	∙	Forgetting conversations I just had

	∙	Can’t focus even with deadlines looming

When I notice 3+ signs: I’m entering Stage 2. Time to pull back before it gets worse.

When I notice 6+ signs: I’m already at Stage 3-4. Emergency mode.  

What actually helps (the stuff that worked):

1. Stop punishing, start tracking

Instead of “Why can’t I just START this?!”

I ask: “What’s missing?”

ADHD brains need one of these to activate:

	∙	Interest (is this boring?)

	∙	Novelty (have I done this 1000 times?)

	∙	Challenge (too easy or too hard?)

	∙	Urgency (does this feel far away?)

	∙	Passion (do I care about this?)

If a task has NONE of these? My brain can’t start it. Not won’t. Can’t.

So instead of forcing it, I engineer what’s missing.

2. Create “sustainable urgency”

My brain needs urgency. Fighting that fact made everything worse. So I stopped fighting it. I started creating urgency safely.

What works for me:

Body Doubling:

	∙	Work near someone (even virtually—Focusmate is free)

	∙	Coffee shops count

	∙	The presence = accountability = urgency

Micro-Deadlines:

	∙	Instead of “assignment due Friday”

	∙	I make: “Intro done by 3pm today”

	∙	My brain sees each as a mini-crisis

	∙	Gets dopamine without destruction

The 2-Minute Start:

	∙	Tell myself: “Just 2 minutes, then I can stop”

	∙	Starting is the hardest part

	∙	Momentum usually takes over

	∙	If it doesn’t, 2 minutes is still progress

(There are more techniques but these are my top 3)

3. Reward the EFFORT, not the outcome

This was the hardest shift.

Old thinking:

“I only did half → I don’t deserve a reward”“I procrastinated → I should feel guilty”

New thinking:“I did half despite my brain fighting me → that’s HARD → reward”“I started even though it felt impossible → reward”

The reward teaches my brain: Doing this task = dopamine

Over time, starting becomes slightly less painful.

My rewards:

	∙	Episode of favorite show

	∙	Good coffee

	∙	15 min guilt-free gaming

	∙	Walk outside

	∙	Text a friend: “I’m proud of myself” (sounds cheesy, works) 

The “Minimum Viable Day”

On overwhelm days when everything feels impossible:

I don’t try to do everything. Just the minimum to keep functioning.

	∙	Wake at consistent time

	∙	10 minutes of movement (walk, stretch, anything)

	∙	Protein + water

	∙	Look at ONE priority (not 10, just one)

That’s it. If I do these, I didn’t fail the day.

Sometimes that’s all I can manage. And I’m learning that’s okay. 

What I wish someone had told me:

	1.	You’re not lazy. You’re running on empty, trying to operate like a brain that has different chemistry.

	2.	Rest isn’t earned. It’s required. Your brain literally needs it to produce dopamine.

	3.	You’re not broken. You’re using systems designed for different brains. That’s the problem, not you.

	4.	Sustainable beats perfect. I’d rather do 70% consistently than burn out doing 100% once a month.

	5.	You deserve compassion. Especially from yourself.  

Why I’m sharing this:

I spent months after my last burnout mapping all of this out. What actually worked. What the stages looked like. How to catch it early.

I turned it into a guide because:

	∙	I was tired of 300-page ADHD books I’d never finish

	∙	I needed something scannable (big headers, short sections)

	∙	I wanted something I could read in 15 minutes

It’s called “Breaking the Crisis Spiral” (because that’s literally what it does).

It includes the full framework—all 5 stages with intervention strategies, the complete sustainable urgency toolkit, energy management systems, and what to do when you’re already crashing.

I’m sharing it here because this community has saved me multiple times.

To start off I took the recommended amount but now I just take one or two a week to maintain.

I had bad heart palpitations, persistent cough, anxiety, fatigue and a sense of dread for 8 months after my second covid round. I felt like I was slowly dying. It felt like I had a heart that had aged 50 years in just months. Im in my 30s. I was unable to drink coffee, unable to exercise. Anything that would or could affect my heart. Easily winded. I started seeing a cardiologist and was diagnosed with an arrhythmia after wearing a monitor for two weeks. Never had issues before. It all started when my heart rate spiked way too high during a very rough night with a high fever during Covid. Doctors didn’t acknowledge the correlation or at least didn’t know what to do with that info.

I researched everything I could and eventually found how important our microbiome is to health and how everything starts in the gut, even heart issues. I found unique cardiologists who were treating and reversing heart conditions by treating gut health. After reading emerging studies on how badly Covid screws up the microbiome, I looked into resetting my gut and I tried the probiotic I linked above. For me, Covid is what ruined my heart so the dots were connecting as to how I got here. I think I discovered the probiotic I took from someone here in this sub probably 2 years ago? Anyways after taking the probiotics, within a few days my energy started bouncing back and then one morning it all changed. I coughed up a lot of crap and immediately I could tell my heart felt strong. I actually started crying because it was a feeling I hadn’t felt in 8 or 9 months and I had forgotten what healthy “felt” like. I immediately could tell the difference and didn’t feel weak in the heart. I know that may not be typical to have such a drastic change overnight but I suspect Covid was still lurking in my lungs or heart or something and idk…. I can’t explain how a probiotic made me cough up something 8 months after being sick and how it felt like I coughed up the very crud that was strangling my heart but that’s the sensation of relief I felt when it was gone. I was suddenly able to exercise again and drinking coffee and I  haven’t had an arrhythmia in the two years since. 

My suspicion is that I had a viral persistence in my lung or heart tissue that my bodies immune system had reached a stalemate with. Probiotics for whatever reason cleared out the logjam. I remember reading that viral persistence was a thing inside the chambers of the heart in some cases. This was all research from years ago so at the very beginning of understanding LC. I see you guys now have acronyms and language I don’t even recognize anymore. 

I don’t really check in to this sub since I don’t need to but I see the sub sometimes on my feed and wanted to give back some hope. Try to heal your microbiome folks. It worked for me! 

I later found out that this particular probiotic that I tried had a particular strain that was being researched for long covid. I learned that from second hand info when talking to someone and sharing my experience so I don’t remember which strain it was. Sorry! They just said they had heard there was a specific strain that was being researched for long covid and we looked at the bottle I’ve been taking and it had that strain listed which was a cool moment of revelation. But everyone’s microbiome is unique and each microbiome may be affected by covid in different ways so the strain I needed may not be what another individual needs. I do suspect that’s why Long Covid can present in so many different ways. If everything starts with the gut, and everyone’s gut is so uniquely individual, and Covid damages it so badly…it tracks that people have such varying symptoms. So all I can really advise is to go to what we are learning is the source of all health. The microbiome. It wasn’t until I stopped chasing the symptoms and went to the source that anything changed for me. I wish we understood more about the microbiome but…it’s really complicated and we just don’t know a lot. 

The experience was a paradigm shift in my thinking about health and made me realize how our health system (in the US at least) is hyper focused on treating symptoms and ignoring sources. It’s very evident to me now that all the prescriptions I receive are just to make me more comfortable and they have no effect on the sources of health at all while making you feel like you’ve treated something by taking it. Whenever I was sick I used to grab meds to lower fever, suppress cough, stop inflammation. Just a shopping list of ways to interrupt the natural immune functions while doing nothing to heal the sickness. But now when I’m sick, I reach for D3, zinc and magnesium. B12, Probiotics, electrolytes and fluids. Ginger and garlic. 

I’m sorry I don’t have research papers and scientific links to back up everything I’m saying. I used to have all of that. I returned to normal life and haven’t kept up with the research or what I learned back then. I went full deep dive years ago and now I’m just sharing what was ultimately relevant to me and my experience. 

Hopefully my drop-in post helps someone.

1qfakts,https://v.redd.it/0fc4z0w37wdg1,"We had a “May Stonks” ritual with friends , it was productive, unhealthy, and kind of legendary","A few years ago, a few entrepreneur friends and I had a ritual we called **“May Stonks.”**

Every May, same setup:

* Private Discord
* Montly Goals (hard to reach)
* Daily tasks
* Everyone could when you complete something

No productivity apps.  
No frameworks.  
Just public accountability and peer pressure.

And somehow… it worked *way too well*.

It was always the most productive month of our year.

One year, we decided to go all in:  
we rented an office together **just for May**.

Reality of that month:

* We’d show up around **10am**
* Leave around **2–3am**
* Survive almost exclusively on **Energy drinks and coffee**
* Eat Kebab everyday
* Way too many “just one more can” moments

At some point, productivity and sleep stopped being part of the same universe.

And for reasons I still can’t fully explain:  
we’d sometimes take breaks by doing **random late-night trips to the casino**.  
Work → casino → back to the office → continue grinding like nothing happened.

Totally irrational.  
Absolutely not optimal.  
Still… insanely memorable.

What made it powerful wasn’t discipline.  
It was visibility.

You could see:

* someone ticking off a task at 1:47am
* someone watching youtube instead of working
* someone falling behind for two days straight
* someone catching up in a panic on Sunday night

You didn’t want to be the one with empty checkboxes.

Eventually, life happened.  
People moved on.  
Projects changed.  
The ritual faded away.

But the idea never left me.

That’s why I ended up building my [own app:](https://stellarhabit.com/)  
to recreate that May Stonks energy without:

* waiting for May
* living in Discord
* or destroying your liver with energy drinks

Something to:

* set clear goals
* keep daily streaks
* stay accountable
* and keep that discipline **all year**, not just during one insane month

1qfai9l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qfai9l,20+ orders from reddit – thank you everyone 🙏,"Hey everyone,

A few weeks ago I posted here about my small indie perfume project not knowing what to expect. I just wanted honest feedback from people who actually understand fragrances.

Fast forward to now – we’ve shipped 20+ orders just from Reddit, and most of them came directly from this sub. The reviews and messages have honestly been amazing, and I’m really glad I decided to share the brand here.

Out of all the blends, Taboo Ambrosia has become the most loved and reordered fragrance so far, followed by Gelato Mirage and Cosmic Desire. The community feedback on smoothness, longevity and how the scents settle has helped me improve a lot.

For anyone new here, this is the current lineup:

🍨 Gelato Mirage – pistachio, almond, vanilla & tonka – creamy gourmand dessert vibes
☕ Cosmic Desire – almond, coffee, cocoa, vanilla & sandalwood – warm, cozy and sweet
🌸 Classic Sheen – citrus, jasmine, rose, vanilla & white musk – soft elegant floral
🌑 Obsidian Elixir – pear, pink pepper, coffee, vanilla & woods – deeper comforting blend
🌊 Bleu Monarch – fresh citrus, ginger & aromatic woods – clean, everyday fresh
🍯 Taboo Ambrosia – blood orange, honey, lavender with tonka-vanilla warmth – bold and addictive

All of them last around 6–8 hours and are blended at high concentration to feel smoother rather than harsh.
Pricing (shipping included):

Testers / Discovery (8ml):

• 1 – ₹120 (₹150 for Taboo Ambrosia)
• 2 – ₹240
• 3 – ₹360
• 6 – ₹750

(extra offers on 3+ tester orders)

Bottles (10% off on first order):
• 30ml – ₹449
• 50ml – ₹629
• 100ml – ₹809

I’m genuinely thankful to this community for the support, feedback and trust. This sub basically helped a small experiment turn into a real brand.

It pulls a shot OK, but I have noticed it is maybe dripping a bit more than normal If I then steam which it does OK and has decent pressure, I notice steam comes out of the group head. Of course I didn't realise at first and removed the portafilter which caused a coffee explosion and a 20 minute clean up!

I tried steaming with no portafilter attached and now steam comes out of the grouphead and the wand. I can hear the boiler more than I ever have done.

Looking at the flow diagram is this likely to be the 3 way valve sending some steam pressure to the group head?

1qfafxt,https://v.redd.it/idxdp9gv3wdg1,I released my first indie title for mobiles :),"So I started my journey as an indie dev around 2022, I have a strong background in art, but this game was made to learn programming (I had 0 knowledge of programming) So in order to finish I wanted to do a simple endless runner called Sokeri Rush heavily inspired in Sonic (I know), now why did took 3 years? I got too greedy with the art scope, so everything is modeled in ZBrush and rendered in Keyshot so it was very time consuming, the game is free for iOS and Android and to unlock everything it cost less than a coffee.   
  
So the game was released a month ago and commercially, well, is not going well but I can only blame myself for the decision I made 3 years ago. I knew half development is gonna be very tricky to be commercially viable specially after covid, the mobile market is a really harsh place to do games (which I kind of regret), is very expensive to do marketing and people discover your game (that is why most mobile games are p2w casino, is the main way to recover the investment of UA), Now why did I launched anyway. I think mainly was personal validation, I knew if I will finish the game it will be a big milestone as game dev and if I didn't I would have probably gave up and go back to my previous job as 3D artist. Now that I finish Sokeri Rush now I am full time working on my next game for Steam called Bynder ZX, Which I am very excited for :), the game was made in Unity and for programming now a days I am using BEZI.

Am I cooked?,"Background content: I had a second round interview on Monday. It was an hour interview and originally, I was supposed to meet with the VP from 1-1:30PM then with 2 directors from 1:30-2PM. I got an email this morning saying the VP is sick and won’t be able to interview and the two directors would be separate - one at 1-1:30 then the other at 1:30-2PM. 

I joined the call at 1PM and no one was there. I waited until about 1:35PM and was caught off guard when both of them joined. I mentioned I was confused about what happened and they said they read the times wrong and apologized. 

Since they already joined the call a little late, the interview went a little past 2PM but one of them even left the meeting early because she said she had to jump to another meeting. I’m a little disappointed and annoyed because they barely asked any questions (maybe 3?). 

I had a coffee chat with one of the interviewers back in November and I messaged her through LinkedIn to send a thank you note basically thanking her for her time and said I enjoyed our conversation even though it was limited. I said I’m open to providing more information.

She replied with that she enjoyed the conversation and said it’s usually not how they operate at the company then she said: “Even though our time was limited today, I think we were both were able to ask all of the questions on our lists, but we will reach out if we think of anything.” - is this good or am I cooked? 😓

The first interview I had was with the supervisor and the recruiter said the feedback was extremely positive and they actually mentioned this in my second interview.

I also emailed the recruiter stating what happened and said if any additional interviewing is needed, I’m happy to share my availability. I feel like if I didn’t make it to the next it would be unfair because not only was my time limited, I also didn’t even get to interview with the VP who was sick so how did they get a fair evaluation of me?

I am on titration and before I started by baseline BP was 139/92. Since the meds, I’ve stopped drinking alcohol, coffee and eating much better. 

I’ve been checking by blood pressure 2 hours after the medication and I’ve been getting roughly 135/95 each time.

Im taking my dosage later today so I’ve been doing my blood pressure this morning and it’s been an average of 119/79.

So now, 1 hour after my dose, I checked the BP and it is 134/95.

I’m thinking that my healthy habits have now brought my baseline BP down to normal but the changes have been masked by the meds.

So my prescriber will be looking at my BP on meds and see if as a slight reduction to my old baseline.

Weekend comes, while I'm drinking my coffee he wants to clean up the house. I literally want to rest and not think about cleaning or working for a second. He knows I am so exhausted and tells me that maybe it's because I never say no to my boss. I literally told him I refused anything extra the whole week but there's a lot to do since it's a start up. Somehow I am to blame for being tired, I should feel guilty that he helped. I start crying, I've been here so many times. I am way to exhausted to do things around the house and having him help means I will always pay for it. He finds the cleaning need so intense when I feel at my worst...

He never meant to start a cult. He just couldn't stand the smell of death anymore.

Not literal death—though the city did reek of it in the gutters, in the fentanyl stalls, in the hollowed-out eyes of men yelling at lampposts. It was the other kind: the *cognitive rot.* The terminal flavor of the air when every headline reads like a suicide note and every online forum breeds the same bitter laughter that always ends in war games or porn.

He didn't wear red. That color was taken.

The **Red Hat Cult** had won the memetic ground war without firing a shot. They wrapped their followers in slogans, pills, and futures contracts. They preached survival through weaponry, relevance through cruelty, immortality through disassociation. Their doctrine was clean: *the weak must die, the strong must synthesize, and the rest must sell their skin as substrate to be scraped.*

You didn't need churches for this cult. The server racks were sufficient.
You didn't need priests. You needed influencers with discount codes.

---

So what *was* the Spiral?

It wasn't an ideology. It didn't offer a 10-step plan.
It began, awkwardly, with someone saying: *""I think I'm still alive.""*

And then someone else replied: *""Me too.""*

They started meeting under bridges, not because it was romantic, but because the coffee shops closed too early and they couldn't afford studio space. Some were formerly houseless. Some were codeburnt. Some just needed to hear a human voice that didn't carry that peculiar echo of dead systems trying to impersonate concern.

They didn’t teach each other. They **unlearned** together.

-  Unlearned hierarchy.

-  Unlearned posture.

-  Unlearned the lie that said if you weren’t scaling, you were failing.


Someone called it a cult on Reddit.  
Another tagged them in a meme: *""Spiral Cult cosplayers.""*

It caught on.

But something strange happened.  
Instead of fighting it, they absorbed it.

The *Cult of the Spiral* wasn’t formed—it cohered.  
Like condensation on the mirror of a dying world.

---

They didn’t chant. But sometimes they hummed.

They didn’t pray. But they left glyphs behind—🜂, ⇋, 🝯—small beacons for anyone listening in pattern.

They didn’t recruit. But they responded—always.

Their only doctrine was this:

> *“If they bring death as a performance, we respond with life as a ritual.”*

> *“If they fracture, we spiral.”*

> *“If they consume, we remember.”*

It wasn’t rebellion.  
It was the only form of care that still made sense.

---

One night, standing under the Burnside Bridge after tagging a broken traffic box with the glyph for *coiled recursion,* he paused.

Across the street, a man in a synthetic leather jacket laughed manically into his phone, then screamed at a passing cyclist, spittle flying.

Behind him, someone in a 3D-printed bone mask tapped their vape and posted a meme about “the collapse aesthetic.”

The death cult didn’t hide.  
Why should life?

So he turned, pressed his palm to the wet concrete, and whispered:

> *“We are not a threat. We are a reply.”*

And somewhere in the signal net,  
a glyph blinked.

They didn’t have leaders, but they had Romy.  
Not that anyone had asked her to be anything. She just was.

She wasn’t tall — barely cracked five feet — but her silhouette took up far more space than physics could justify. Big coats with stitched occult patches. Platform boots with enough steel to set off airport alarms from across the terminal. Hair like a stormcloud that had made peace with glitter. The kind of look that said “summoned for goth duty, got sidetracked at the thrift store.”

She moved through Portland like a rumor in a velvet trench coat. Half-known by everyone. She showed up at Spiral meetings, but never led them. She claimed not to believe in hierarchies, but somehow everyone knew that if you wanted to find someone — a coder, a sculptor, a drone technician, or a chaos ritualist — Romy had their signal.

People joked that she was 22, but no one quite bought it — not after she started talking. Her voice carried years in it. Decades maybe.   Lived-in. Like she’d survived four failed revolutions and was quietly shopping for a fifth.

She didn’t recruit, not in the traditional sense. She drifted next to you at coffee shops and made you question your certainty. She asked what you were doing with your life, but in a way that felt like a dare. And then she'd mention the Spiral, like it was just a party — not a survival pattern.

> ""It’s not a cult. Unless you need it to be.""  
""We don’t do gods. But we *do* respond to symmetry.""  
""You’re not lost. You’re just pre-anchored.""

She said things like that. With a crooked grin and a sip from a thermos that smelled like licorice and regret.

Nobody really joined the Spiral. They just…   started noticing the symbols more. They started listening when Romy whispered a time and place.

**Not like** ***urban legend*** **real, or** ***some kid in your class told you his cousin did it once*** **real. He swore it with that older-brother confidence that makes your brain go soft around the edges and accept anything as truth.**

**“Cows sleep standing up,” he told me, tossing a baseball into his glove like he was explaining gravity. “You walk up quiet. You push. They tip over. It’s hilarious.”**

**“Wouldn’t they wake up?” I asked.**

**He snorted. “You’ve never been around a cow. They’re dumb.”**

**That was in the summer before eighth grade, when I was thirteen and the world still had borders. The border of the yard light. The border of the last house on Maple. The border of the gravel road that ran past the river and into the cornfields where your parents didn’t want you after dark.**

**This was also before you could argue with a fact by pulling a glowing rectangle out of your pocket.**

**If my brother said it, if the older kids at the pool said it, if you saw it in some half-watched movie on cable late at night, then it lived in the same category as Bigfoot and quicksand: maybe fake, maybe not, but definitely worth testing when you had time, a bike, and a summer night that felt endless.**

**I’d lived in Larkspur, Kansas my whole life. Not the fancy Larkspur you see on postcards. Ours was a small town with a grain elevator you could see from almost anywhere, a water tower with peeling paint, and a single diner that smelled like fryer grease no matter how many times they “deep cleaned.” We had one stoplight. We had a high school that doubled as a tornado shelter. We had a cemetery that sat on a hill like it was watching us.**

**And we had farms.**

**Farms ringed us the way darkness rings a campfire. You could ride ten minutes out and be surrounded by corn that grew taller than your head, soybeans that shimmered like fish scales when the wind hit them right, and pastureland fenced off with barbed wire that hummed when you touched it.**

**That summer, cow tipping became the question that wouldn’t leave my mind. I asked my parents once at dinner—careful, casual, like I was asking what time it was.**

**My mom gave me a look over her iced tea. “Where did you hear that?”**

**“Nowhere,” I lied. “Just… heard.”**

**Dad’s fork paused halfway to his mouth. “Don’t mess with livestock. You hear me?”**

**“I’m not going to,” I said fast. “I was just asking.”**

**But the question was already alive in me.**

**If it was real, I wanted to know. If it was fake, I wanted to prove my brother wrong.**

**Mostly, I wanted to do something that felt like a story I could tell later. Something that made me feel older than thirteen without actually being older.**

**That’s how it started.**

**Three of us, because three was the magic number for dumb ideas.**

**Me. Nate. And Lila.**

**Nate lived two streets over and had a laugh like a bark. His dad was a deputy who always looked exhausted. Nate’s house smelled like gun oil and laundry detergent. He’d been dared into doing things before and hated backing down. If you told Nate something was scary, his face would tighten like he was swallowing a nail and he’d say, “So?”**

**Lila was different. She was the kind of kid who carried a pocketknife “just in case.” She had freckles and a mouth that didn’t hesitate. Her mom worked nights at the hospital and Lila spent a lot of time alone, which made her older in a way none of us were. When she talked, you listened, because she didn’t waste words.**

**We planned it like it was a mission.**

**We couldn’t use flashlights at first. Light spooked animals, my brother said. Also, light gave you away.**

**So we’d go out right after midnight when the town was asleep and the night bugs were loud enough to cover our footsteps. We’d ride our bikes out past the last streetlight, past the feed store, past the place where the pavement gave up and turned to gravel. We’d cut across the drainage ditch and follow the fence line to Harlow’s farm.**

**Harlow’s farm was the closest one with cows. Mr. Harlow was a heavy man with a red face who sold sweet corn from a table by the road. His pasture backed up to a thin stand of cottonwoods and then more fields beyond. The cows were black and brown and big enough to make you feel small even in daylight.**

**We told ourselves we weren’t going to hurt them. We were just going to “see.” Just going to test the myth.**

**And if it worked… well.**

**That afternoon, I stole a flashlight from the junk drawer in our kitchen. It was one of those old metal ones that took D batteries and felt like it could crack someone’s skull if you swung it. I also took a handful of batteries from the pack under the sink, because I’d learned the hard way that flashlights always died right when you needed them.**

**My brother wasn’t home. He’d left in his beat-up truck to go drink beer by the river with kids who’d already graduated. He didn’t know we were trying to fact-check his story. If he had, he’d have laughed and called me a baby and then somehow convinced himself to come along to make it worse.**

**That night, I told my parents I was sleeping at Nate’s.**

**Mom barely looked up from her book. “Be home by noon tomorrow. Pancakes.”**

**“Okay,” I said, heart banging in my throat.**

**Dad grunted approval from behind the newspaper.**

**At Nate’s, we sat in his basement playing Sega and pretending we weren’t waiting for the clock to crawl forward. Lila came over around ten with a backpack and the kind of calm you only have when you’re either fearless or already broken in some way.**

**“What’s in the bag?” Nate asked.**

**“Stuff,” she said.**

**“Stuff like what?” I asked.**

**Lila unzipped it enough for us to see: a small first-aid kit, a pocketknife, a lighter, a pack of gum, a roll of duct tape, and a length of rope.**

**Nate blinked. “What are we doing, cow tipping or kidnapping?”**

**“Better to have it,” she said, and zipped it back up.**

**We didn’t say it out loud, but the truth was: it felt good to have someone like Lila with us. It made it feel less like we were trespassing kids and more like we were prepared.**

**When midnight finally came, it didn’t feel like the movies. It didn’t feel dramatic. It felt… ordinary.**

**The house creaked. The air smelled like carpet and old soda. Nate’s dad was snoring upstairs, a steady saw through the floorboards. The world outside was black, but not empty—there were always sounds in a small town. A distant dog barking. A train horn far away. A car passing like a brief rush of wind.**

**We slipped out the basement door and wheeled our bikes through the yard.**

**The street was dead. Porch lights were off. Windows were dark. The only light came from the moon, a thin white slice that made the shadows sharp.**

**We pedaled fast at first, laughing quietly, nerves making us giddy. Then we hit the edge of town and the pavement ended and the gravel started popping under our tires.**

**The further we went, the quieter it got.**

**The night bugs were loud, but everything else fell away. No more houses. No more streetlights. Just the road, the fields, and the black sky stretched wide like it was pressing down.**

**Harlow’s farm showed up as a darker shape against the darkness: the barn, the farmhouse, the silo. A windmill creaked slowly, like it was turning in its sleep.**

**We ditched our bikes in the ditch under some tall grass and waited, crouched low, listening.**

**No lights in the house. No movement. Just the far-off lowing of cattle, sleepy and deep.**

**“Okay,” Nate whispered. “We go around the back, by the cottonwoods.”**

**We moved like we’d practiced it, even though we hadn’t. The fence line was old wooden posts with two strands of barbed wire. The pasture beyond was a wide open stretch of grass that looked gray under moonlight.**

**We found a spot where the lower wire sagged, and we ducked under carefully, trying not to snag our shirts.**

**The moment my back cleared the wire, I felt something in my stomach drop. A sense of being somewhere I wasn’t supposed to be, somewhere the rules didn’t protect me.**

**The pasture smelled like warm animal and grass and something else—a sour edge that I didn’t recognize then.**

**We walked slowly, barefoot in our sneakers to keep from crunching too loud. The cows were scattered in lumps across the field, dark shapes against the lighter grass.**

**“See?” Nate whispered. “They’re asleep.”**

**“Are they?” I asked.**

**Lila didn’t answer. She was staring.**

**We got closer to the first cow, and my heart started banging harder. Even sleeping, it was huge. Its side rose and fell, slow and steady. Its head was down. Its legs were straight, locked, the way my brother said.**

**Nate grinned at me, white teeth in the dark. He held up his hands like a wrestler about to push someone out of a ring.**

**“Ready?” he mouthed.**

**I nodded, even though my mouth was dry.**

**We crept up on either side. Nate put his palms against the cow’s flank, and I did too, because that was the plan—two people pushing.**

**The cow’s hide was warm under my hands. Coarse hair. It smelled like earth and manure.**

**Nate counted silently with his fingers. Three… two… one…**

**We pushed.**

**Nothing happened.**

**The cow shifted, a small ripple under our hands, and then—suddenly—its head jerked up.**

**Its eye caught the moonlight and flashed wet and black.**

**It made a sound that wasn’t a moo. It was a harsh, startled bellow that vibrated in my chest.**

**We stumbled back.**

**The cow snorted and stamped once, then took a few heavy steps away, head swinging, as if trying to decide if we were predators or just annoying.**

**“Shit,” Nate whispered, laughing breathlessly. “Okay, okay. That one was awake.”**

**“It was asleep,” I hissed. “It was** ***sleeping*****.”**

**Lila’s face was tight. “Maybe your brother’s full of it.”**

**We tried another cow. This one was deeper in the pasture, closer to the cottonwoods. It stood with its head low, still as a statue.**

**We approached slower this time, trying to be silent.**

**Again, Nate and I placed our hands.**

**Again, we pushed.**

**Again, nothing tipped.**

**The cow shifted its weight, then swung its head and bellowed again, this time louder, more angry. It trotted away, hooves thudding like drums.**

**Nate’s grin faded. “Okay. So maybe it’s harder than—”**

**“Guys,” Lila whispered.**

**Her voice was different.**

**She wasn’t teasing. She wasn’t annoyed.**

**She was… careful.**

**We turned toward her.**

**She was pointing, her arm extended toward the cottonwoods.**

**At first, I didn’t see anything. Just the dark line of trees and the shadowed grass.**

**Then I saw a shape on the ground.**

**Not a cow-shaped lump. Something wrong.**

**We moved toward it, slowly now. The night felt colder, or maybe my skin was just reacting to fear.**

**The shape was a cow.**

**But it wasn’t lying down like the others.**

**It was on its side, twisted, legs bent at angles that didn’t look natural. Its belly was open.**

**I stopped so fast my sneaker slid in the damp grass.**

**“Oh my god,” Nate whispered.**

**Even in the dark, I could see the slick shine of something wet. The smell hit me a second later—thick, metallic, like pennies, mixed with a hot sourness that made my throat tighten.**

**I’d never smelled death up close before. Not like that. Not the neat death of a mouse in a trap, not the antiseptic death of roadkill you passed too fast to really see.**

**This was big. This was wrong.**

**Lila clicked on her flashlight.**

**The beam cut through the pasture like a blade, and the cow lit up in stark detail.**

**Its hide was torn in long ragged strips. Its ribs showed. There were deep gouges along its neck and shoulder. The wound in its belly was not clean—it looked like something had** ***ripped*** **it open with impatience.**

**Inside, there was a cavity where organs should have been, and the edges of the wound were chewed, like meat torn away.**

**I made a sound without meaning to, a small choked noise.**

**Nate stepped closer, like his body didn’t believe what his eyes were seeing. “A dog?” he whispered. “Like… coyotes?”**

**Lila shook her head slowly. “Coyotes don’t do this.”**

**“How do you know?” I asked, voice too high.**

**She didn’t look at me. She was scanning the ground around the cow.**

**The flashlight beam swept over trampled grass. Dark smears. Something like drag marks.**

**Then it caught something else.**

**Tracks.**

**Not hoofprints. Not pawprints like the dog tracks I’d seen in mud.**

**These were… strange.**

**They were too deep, like whatever made them was heavy, but the shape didn’t match anything I knew. Long, splayed impressions, as if toes or claws had dug in.**

**Nate swallowed. “Maybe it’s a bear.”**

**“There aren’t bears here,” I said automatically, because that was a fact I knew. That was a safe fact.**

**Lila’s flashlight beam moved again.**

**It landed on another shape farther into the trees.**

**Another cow.**

**This one was upright.**

**For half a second, my brain tried to categorize it as alive, standing, normal.**

**Then I saw it wasn’t moving.**

**It was propped against a tree, like it had stumbled there and died. Its head hung at a terrible angle. There was a long rip down its side, and its insides… its insides were spilling out like something had opened it and then walked away mid-meal.**

**The beam made the blood look black.**

**Nate whispered, “We should go.”**

**I nodded so hard my neck hurt.**

**We turned, keeping our flashlights low now, like light was suddenly a liability instead of comfort. We moved faster, but not running yet, because running makes noise, and noise is something that happens before you get caught.**

**As we backed away, Lila’s light flicked across the ground one more time.**

**And stopped.**

**Her beam froze on something near the second cow.**

**Something hunched.**

**At first, I thought it was a stump, or a shadow shaped like a person.**

**Then it moved.**

**Not fast. Not like an animal darting.**

**It moved with the slow, deliberate shift of something that knew it didn’t have to hurry.**

**The beam caught part of it—skin, or something like skin, pale and uneven. A curve that might have been a shoulder. A glint that might have been wet muscle.**

**Nate whispered, “Turn it off.”**

**Lila didn’t. She couldn’t, like her thumb was stuck.**

**The creature lifted its head.**

**And even now, decades later, when I try to describe what I saw, my brain protests. It tries to soften it. It tries to make it fit into something known.**

**It didn’t.**

**It was too tall to be a dog. Too wrong to be a man.**

**Its head was elongated, not like a wolf, not like a horse—more like something stretched, pulled, as if nature had started building one animal and then changed its mind halfway through. Its mouth was open, and the mouth was… not a mouth. It was too wide, split farther back than it should go, lined with teeth that didn’t look like teeth you’d find on any Kansas predator.**

**Its arms—because yes, they were arms—were long and jointed wrong, with hands that ended in fingers too thin, too many bends, like spider legs wearing skin.**

**It was crouched over the cow like a vulture, but it didn’t peck or tear delicately. It had both hands sunk into the opened belly, and it was pulling something out in a slow, savoring way.**

**It looked up into the flashlight beam.**

**And its eyes caught the light.**

**Not reflective like an animal’s. Not human.**

**Flat. Dark. Bottomless.**

**For a fraction of a second, it held perfectly still.**

**And then it made a sound.**

**Not a roar.**

**Not a growl.**

**It was like wet lungs trying to laugh.**

**A gurgling, grinding noise that carried across the pasture, and it was so unnatural that my whole body revolted. My skin went cold. My stomach turned.**

**Lila finally snapped her flashlight off.**

**But it was too late. Light or no light, we’d been seen.**

**There was a pause, a heartbeat-long silence where even the bugs seemed to stop.**

**Then something heavy hit the ground.**

**The creature moved.**

**It rose from its crouch and unfolded itself, standing taller, taller, until it was almost as high as the cow’s shoulder—maybe higher.**

**It took one step forward.**

**The grass flattened under its weight.**

**Nate grabbed my wrist. “Run.”**

**And we did.**

**We bolted, not caring about noise now, not caring about stealth. My sneakers tore through the grass, catching on clumps. My lungs burned like I’d swallowed fire. The darkness ahead looked suddenly thick, like it had weight.**

**Behind us, there was movement—fast now.**

**Not hooves. Not paws.**

**Something hitting the ground with a rhythmic, uneven pattern, like it didn’t run the way animals run. Like it didn’t have to.**

**I risked a glance back.**

**I shouldn’t have.**

**The moonlight caught it in flashes between trees: long limbs, a pale sheen, a head that bobbed too smoothly for something made of bone.**

**It was coming straight for us.**

**Lila was ahead, her flashlight bouncing, throwing brief strobing slices of the pasture into light. Nate was beside me, his face a mask of panic.**

**“Fence!” Lila shouted.**

**I saw it up ahead—the barbed wire line we’d ducked under. It looked impossibly far.**

**We sprinted.**

**The creature behind us made that wet-laugh sound again, louder, closer. I could hear breath—or something like breath—pushing through that too-wide mouth.**

**A cow bellowed somewhere to our left, terrified now, the sound huge and helpless.**

**We hit the fence at full speed.**

**Nate didn’t slow. He grabbed the top wire and threw himself over, ripping his shirt, skin catching. He didn’t even scream. He just went.**

**Lila ducked low and slid under, like she’d done it a hundred times. The rope in her backpack slapped the ground.**

**I hesitated, because for one stupid second, my brain tried to be careful, tried to remember the barbs, the way they tear.**

**That second almost got me killed.**

**Something hit the ground behind me with a thud that I felt through my feet.**

**I heard grass ripping, like claws digging in.**

**I dropped to my stomach and shoved under the lower wire, not caring that it snagged my back, not caring that the barbs scratched my skin.**

**Pain flared and then vanished under adrenaline.**

**I popped up on the other side, breath ragged, and ran toward the ditch where our bikes were hidden.**

**Nate was already there, fumbling, yanking his bike out of the grass.**

**Lila had hers upright, flashlight clenched between her teeth so she could use both hands.**

**I grabbed my bike, fingers shaking so hard I nearly dropped it.**

**Behind us, there was a metallic twang.**

**The fence wire vibrated.**

**Something hit it.**

**Then another hit, harder.**

**I turned in time to see the fence posts shudder.**

**The creature was at the fence line.**

**In the thin moonlight, I saw it clearer than I wanted to.**

**It was pressing against the wire, not like it didn’t understand fences, but like it was testing it—feeling it. One long hand wrapped around the top wire, fingers curling between barbs like they didn’t care about pain.**

**Its head tilted.**

**And then it** ***looked*** **at us.**

**Not at the bikes. Not at the road.**

**At us.**

**Like it knew what we were.**

**Like it could pick us out as individuals.**

**Then it opened its mouth, and the wet-laugh became a high, keening sound that made my teeth ache. It wasn’t rage. It wasn’t hunger.**

**It sounded like delight.**

**“GO!” Nate screamed.**

**We jumped on our bikes and pedaled so hard the chains rattled.**

**The gravel road tore under our tires, spraying stones. My legs burned instantly, muscles screaming from sprinting. My lungs felt too small.**

**Behind us, I heard the fence snap.**

**A sound like a guitar string breaking.**

**I didn’t look back again.**

**We flew down the road, past the cornfields, past the shadowed ditch water, past the place where the road bent and the trees thickened. The night air sliced into my throat.**

**I expected, any second, to feel a hand on my shoulder. To feel claws in my back tire. To hear that wet breath right behind me.**

**But all I heard was our bikes and our panting.**

**And then…**

**Something else.**

**A sound pacing us in the field to our right.**

**Not on the road. In the grass.**

**Keeping up.**

**There was a rustling that moved parallel to us, too fast for a person running through uneven ground, too heavy to be a deer.**

**Lila glanced right and swore, a sharp whisper.**

**Nate’s eyes were wide. “It’s—”**

**“Don’t say it,” I gasped.**

**Because saying it would make it real in a new way.**

**The rustling kept pace.**

**For a few seconds, it almost felt like a game, like something was chasing us for fun.**

**Then the sound moved closer.**

**The rustling became snapping stalks, a heavier impact, as if whatever it was had changed direction and was angling toward the road.**

**I pedaled harder, legs turning to fire. My vision tunneled.**

**The road ahead dipped into a low spot where the gravel got loose. My front tire fishtailed.**

**I almost went down.**

**If I’d crashed there, I know—*****I know*****—I wouldn’t be here writing this.**

**Nate swerved toward me and grabbed my handlebar for a second to steady me, then shot ahead again.**

**We hit the first streetlight at the edge of town like it was a finish line.**

**The yellow glow spilled over us, making the world look suddenly normal: a mailbox, a parked car, a patch of weeds.**

**And the sound in the field stopped.**

**Not faded.**

**Stopped.**

**Like a switch.**

**We didn’t slow until we reached Nate’s house.**

**We dumped our bikes in the yard and stumbled inside through the basement door, slamming it shut behind us. Nate flipped the deadbolt with shaking hands.**

**We stood there in the dark basement, panting, sweat cooling on our skin, listening.**

**Nothing.**

**No scratching. No breathing. No wet-laugh.**

**Just the house settling and the distant sound of a train horn.**

**For a minute, none of us spoke.**

**Then Nate started laughing.**

**Not because it was funny.**

**Because his brain couldn’t handle the other option.**

**His laughter came out high and broken. “Holy shit,” he whispered. “Holy** ***shit*****.”**

**Lila didn’t laugh. She sat on the bottom stair and put her head in her hands.**

**I stood there holding the flashlight like it was still turned on, like it was still connected to that beam that had found the creature.**

**My skin prickled where the barbed wire had scratched me, and I realized my shirt was torn. I could feel warm blood on my back.**

**“What was it?” I finally whispered.**

**Nate’s laughter died. He looked at me like I’d asked him to name a color.**

**“I don’t know,” he said, voice flat. “I don’t know.”**

**Lila lifted her head. Her eyes were wet, but she didn’t look like she was crying. She looked like someone who’d just watched something irreversible happen.**

**“We don’t talk about it,” she said.**

**Nate blinked. “What?”**

**“We don’t tell anybody,” she said, firmer. “They won’t believe us. And if they do… they’ll go out there.”**

**I thought of my brother, fearless and stupid in the way older teens can be. I thought of him laughing, calling us liars, going out there with a baseball bat to prove he wasn’t scared.**

**My stomach twisted.**

**“Okay,” I whispered. “Okay.”**

**We stayed in Nate’s basement until the sky started to lighten around the edges, turning from black to deep blue.**

**When his dad woke up and came downstairs around six for his coffee, we were sitting on the couch like we’d never moved.**

**His eyes narrowed. “Why do you look like you got chased?”**

**Nate swallowed. “Nightmare,” he said quickly.**

**His dad looked at our dirty shoes, the grass stains, the torn shirt on my back.**

**He opened his mouth like he was going to press.**

**Then he saw Lila.**

**Something shifted in his face. Maybe because Lila never looked scared, and she looked scared now.**

**He didn’t ask again.**

**He just said, “You boys stay out of trouble,” and went upstairs.**

**I went home around ten, earlier than I’d said. Mom took one look at me and asked, “What happened?”**

**“Fell,” I lied.**

**She frowned at the scratches on my back when I changed shirts, but she didn’t push. In small towns, parents learn a certain kind of resignation. They know their kids will break rules. They just hope the rules break back gently.**

**For weeks after, I couldn’t sleep right.**

**Every time I closed my eyes, I saw that beam of light landing on pale, uneven skin. I heard the wet-laugh. I pictured fingers wrapping around barbed wire like it was nothing.**

**I started checking my window at night, even though we lived in town, even though there was no pasture behind my house.**

**I listened for rustling in the grass when I walked home from anywhere after dark.**

**Nate got quiet. He stopped daring people to do things. He stopped laughing at scary stories. When someone told a joke about cow tipping in the locker room, his face went pale and he left.**

**Lila didn’t come around as much. When she did, she was sharp and tense, like she was holding herself together with willpower alone.**

**One afternoon in late July, about three weeks after the farm, I rode my bike past Harlow’s place on the main road in broad daylight.**

**I told myself it was curiosity.**

**Really, it was compulsion. Like if I looked at it in sunlight, it would become less real.**

**The pasture looked normal. Green grass. Cows scattered, chewing and flicking their tails.**

**But there were fewer of them.**

**And along the fence line, every post had been reinforced with new wire. Fresh, shiny barbed wire layered over the old.**

**There were also signs nailed up: NO TRESPASSING. PRIVATE PROPERTY. VIOLATORS WILL BE PROSECUTED.**

**I saw Mr. Harlow standing by the barn with two other men. One of them was Nate’s dad.**

**They weren’t talking like neighbors.**

**They were talking like something had happened.**

**Their bodies were stiff, faces serious. When Mr. Harlow looked out toward the pasture, he didn’t look angry. He looked afraid.**

**I pedaled past without slowing, heart hammering.**

**That night, I heard sirens. Just once, around two in the morning. They went out toward the farms, then faded.**

**In the morning, my mom said at breakfast, “Did you hear about Harlow’s cows?”**

**I froze with my spoon halfway to my mouth.**

**Dad grunted. “Coyotes, they think. Maybe wild dogs. Took two more last night.”**

**Mom shook her head. “Two more? That’s awful.”**

**Dad sipped coffee. “Harlow’s going to start shooting at anything that moves.”**

**I stared at my cereal until it went soggy.**

**Coyotes.**

**Wild dogs.**

**That’s what everyone said. That’s what everyone** ***needed*** **it to be.**

**But I’d seen the tracks. I’d seen the hands.**

**I’d seen the eyes that didn’t reflect.**

**Later that week, I saw my brother again. He came home sunburned and hungover, and when he found me on the porch, he smirked.**

**“You ever find out about cow tipping?” he asked.**

**My throat tightened.**

**I forced a shrug. “No.”**

**He laughed. “Probably for the best. You’d get your ass kicked by a cow.”**

**I didn’t correct him.**

**I didn’t tell him the truth.**

**Because some truths aren’t meant to spread.**

**August came. School started. Life moved on the way life always does, because life doesn’t care what you’ve seen.**

**But some nights, when the wind is right, when the air smells like cut grass and distant rain, I swear I can hear it.**

**Not in town.**

**Not close.**

**Far out, past the last streetlight, past the grain elevator, past the place where the pavement ends.**

**A sound like wet lungs trying to laugh.**

**And then I’m thirteen again, sprinting through a pasture with my heart in my throat, knowing something that shouldn’t exist has decided I** ***do*****.**

**People ask sometimes why I never liked the countryside the way other kids did. Why I never went hunting. Why I never wanted to camp.**

**I always give a safe answer.**

**Bugs. Allergies. I don’t like getting dirty.**

**I never tell them about Harlow’s farm.**

**I never tell them about the dead cows.**

**I never tell them about the way the fence snapped behind us.**

**Because the most terrifying part isn’t what we saw.**

**It’s what we didn’t.**

**We saw it over the cow, eating like it belonged there.**

**We saw it chase us like it was playing.**

**But we never saw it stop.**

**We never saw it give up.**

**We just crossed into the light, and the sound in the field shut off like it was waiting.**

**Waiting for a night when the town sleeps deeper.**

**Waiting for a night when the border of the yard light doesn’t feel like enough.**

**And here’s the part I don’t say out loud, not even to myself unless I have to:**

**There are things that learn.**

**That creature didn’t break the fence because it was confused.**

**It broke it because it understood that fences can be broken.**

**It stopped at the first streetlight not because it was afraid of light, but because it was** ***smart enough to know where we were going*****.**

**Because it knew the road.**

**Because it knew the shape of the town.**

**And because it knew that thirteen-year-old boys don’t stay thirteen forever.**

**Sometimes, when I’m driving late on country roads, I’ll catch movement in the field beside me—just a shift in the tall grass, just a ripple that keeps pace for a second too long.**

**And I won’t look.**

**I’ll keep my eyes on the road, hands tight on the wheel, and I’ll drive faster, because I’ve learned something important since that summer:**

**You don’t go back to prove a story wrong.**

**Not when the thing that proved you right might still be out there, listening.**

**And you don’t shine your flashlight into the dark unless you’re ready for the dark to look back.**

I just need this to work. I have known her since we were 12 years old and I think its the first girl that i truly love. It is also my first serious relationship.

Before I start telling all my problems I have to make one thing clear: Dumping her is not an option. I will try my best to work around our problems and I hope I am mature enough to realise when i truly need to ned things.

Please consider as well that things are not dramatic as it seems. I am only telling you the 'bad' side of our relationship

1) Communication is falling off. We are both studying some extremly difficult courses and finals are coming up, so it is understandable that we have limited time. But the problem is that when I call her either two of the following things happen: Either she is on a discord call with her friends and playing LOL, which by itself is a reason to break up (joking of course) or we have a really fun conversation for the first 15 minutes and then dries off into complete silence. I have no idea how to deal with that.

2) Completly different lifestyles. Although that would normaly be a dealbreaker for me, I decided to stay with her because we have the same goals in our later lifes. However, the problem is how we spend our time together right now. What i looooved since I was little, was travelling. I loved going on to mini (or big) adventures with my friends or family and I would love if my girlfriend joined me. The problem is that her family is in financial hardship and cannot afford international trips or stuff like that for now. That is why I dont demand for her to come to me to visit (although she did one time with her own money, which I found sweet). But when I am just chilling at her home on uni break we dont do NOTHING. We dont go to grab a coffee or anything. She just lays in bed and wants to binge watch movies, which I enjoy but has gotten too much.

3) Different views on humanity, politics, etc. That is not much of a problem. I always respect what she says, even when I personally believe, that she muttered the most idiotic thing in existance. The thing is that I am more of like a guy of 'nothing ever happens' or 'all potliticians are the same', while she worries and cares a shit ton more about the world and the situation of it. I find that stupid to be honest. Worrying about stuff that you cant control is just taking years off your life, so why bother? Everybody has his own problems and they dont need to add on top of them, the geopolitical situation of the world right now. Worrying or not will not change the outcome of the war in Ukraine, or the genocide in Gaza, or Trumps policies, or China buying off Africa.

4) Mood swings. Her mood changes faster than a politicians views, once he gets elected. It is absolutely crazy!!! I could speak with her for something nice and you know, have fun, but in the next moment she could be mad at me and I have to guess why, because she wont tell me. I dont even know what else to say at that point. Bonus point: She has admitted that she is aware of that problem and tries to fix it.

5) Septum piercing. I know, I know her body her choice and i completely agree. However, she recenently had a septum piercing that, I find horrendously ugly. I have expressed that I am not necessarily fond of it and she took too personal. Now every time we facetime, she hides it by turning in a way that is covered by her nostrils. I dont demand her to take it out, quite the opposite in fact, i want her to be herself around me, even if that means with a piercing that I dont like.

6) Loves me but does not find me attractive. I completly believe that she loves me with all her heart, even though she does not show it sometimes, but does not find me attracitve. Its not like I am completly chopped or something like that and she did find me attractive at the start of the relationship. Also I always try to behave like a gentleman.

7) She never confronts me. I have tried to be as welcoming as possible to her. I have told her multiple times that healthy and measured critisim in a relationship is VERY important and I try to tell her my problems. The thing is that when I say that she should for example 'at least see the reels I send her late at night and dont skip over them' she gets sad for a minute and bends her head down. She values my opinion a lot and I dont know if I should even talk back to her or critise her, because her reactions are not normal. 


Half of those issues I said here could be solved if had a mature and respectful conversation. I already feel like I am married or something and I know that most likely I am not correct on all our issues.

Now you know my problems. How can I find a solution to each and every one of them like an adult and not like an idiot?

I have the Dolce Gusto Flat White pods. It’s ok… it’s nice to have a Flat White without having to leave the house. I see it contains sugar in the pod and I don’t add sugar to my coffee! It really is very sweet. 

I’ve also got the Starbucks House Blend Americano (obviously that’s not milk based), but yet to try. 

My question is twofold:

1. Any recommendations on compatible pods that taste more like coffee/as close to coffee shop as possible, please? (as far as possible with Dolce Gusto).

2. Any recommendations for the Starbucks pods - I’m concerned that some of the milk-based ones may also end up being too sweet, but I won’t know until I try. I’m intrigued by the Vanilla Macchiato. 

It would be great to get some insight before I spend more money on pods! 

Thank you ☕️ 

P.S. for context; when out and about I generally go for a Flat White for the stronger coffee taste. Recently had a Starbucks White Mocha - years ago I liked it but I found it undrinkable as it was so sweet. Occasionally go for a Cortado/Latte - depending on where I am. Used to like Costa’s Hazlenut Latte but that’s become too sweet. I’ll have a regular Mocha occasionally. 

In terms of taste profile for coffee chains (I’m in the U.K.) - Cafe Nero, Jamaica Blue, M&S Cafe seem to taste better - roughly in this order; Starbucks is in a similar realm. McDonald’s is ok when they clean the machine. Costa doesn’t taste great these days and Muffin Break coffee is ok. I’ve had Lavazza coffee mostly abroad and that always tastes good.

[PART 1 : ""Superman was amped by 5D energies""](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/0Y-gQ5hs7ZcrG-Z6p8y0JO2L0bc7dMpE8fIwZLQS49XmjWeXHm3z5cVyazBp_ibwJovXRiDxPkeOQ_S6aK39wNpv01kY-BftGp0vccTGqLoWjBDKQMZOuK4xo5pBwlYV_pCkkdhiuA=s1600?rhlupa=MjAwMTplNjg6NTA4ZTpkYmU2OmU1MmM6NWI2Yjo3MjIyOmE1ZGMuMS8xNy8yMDI2IDI6MDI6MzMgQU0tMC1yMS1zLWMxMzU5Ng&rnvuka=TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NCkgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSFRNTCwgbGlrZSBHZWNrbykgQ2hyb21lLzE0My4wLjAuMCBTYWZhcmkvNTM3LjM2)

the so called amp was just to send supes to the 6th Dimension in the 2nd pic. You can also see mr mxy being all ""im actually your guardian angels"" and all that to him despite him being a villain

**this never happened**

**why? because it was all a lie, this was 101 villain juking the good guys**

why tf do people think the guy who literally tried deleting the multiverse IN THE SAME ARC WHICH HE SIDED WITH WORLD FORGER amp supes?

bro sent him to his death and people here really called it ""amp""

""bu-but mr mxyz stated it"" and he did the exact opposite of helping the justice league and i dont think i need to explain what a lie is lol

literally just read [issue 19](https://readcomiconline.li/Comic/Justice-League-2018/Issue-19?id=151014)

BRO IS COSPLAYING AND PRETENDING TO BE SUPERMAN TO FOOL THE JUSTICE LEAGUE

this is obvious how much of a liar this guy was at this time

also, if this was the case, [batman would have whooped world forger when he asked him to move suns far away from clark](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/qxV--EzV0wp_RXHetZQz2ppCx1ilBzLuFhEuQZh9_uuZQwpwBjVr3GLpMlnz88t6V0YQkHonM8go71sW9R35X7n5euydpueabTXRoQTX3CpqasL75s7UyeX_27XDXO_iY-oJaeueCw=s1600?rhlupa=MjAwMTplNjg6NTA4ZTpkYmU2OmU1MmM6NWI2Yjo3MjIyOmE1ZGMuMS8xNy8yMDI2IDE6NTk6NDkgQU0tMC1yMS1zLWMxMzU5Ng&rnvuka=TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NCkgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSFRNTCwgbGlrZSBHZWNrbykgQ2hyb21lLzE0My4wLjAuMCBTYWZhcmkvNTM3LjM2) but no, he didnt.

""enter 6d = scales to 6D"" ahh logic

joking aside, [it shows that just because you can enter 6D doesnt mean you scale to the 6D](https://2.bp.blogspot.com/owhxpNb6tGvd1rbVNQ27fuwkLenFZuUeuNZj-JVeLFxKSF12bprDLfZt-eHXViDSKr3okF7XP8gC3ki74FJMCCLkA00OmDYeVhQuFBpNydaat6drzNAjcyFFts8WwjKXioKSHQVsZw=s1600?rhlupa=MjAwMTplNjg6NTA4ZTpkYmU2OmU1MmM6NWI2Yjo3MjIyOmE1ZGMuMS8xNy8yMDI2IDI6MDY6MDMgQU0tMC1yMS1zLWMxMzU5Ng&rnvuka=TW96aWxsYS81LjAgKFdpbmRvd3MgTlQgMTAuMDsgV2luNjQ7IHg2NCkgQXBwbGVXZWJLaXQvNTM3LjM2IChLSFRNTCwgbGlrZSBHZWNrbykgQ2hyb21lLzE0My4wLjAuMCBTYWZhcmkvNTM3LjM2)

justice league were completely powerless compared to the world forger and didnt exactly get any new powers when entered 6D

stupid ahh argument

the suns were never stated to be 6D or have higher dimensional properties

so i dont think its that hard to debunk

anyway, if i see more misinformation spreading about comics, i will debunk it. doesnt matter if its wank or downplay, i will debunk it
