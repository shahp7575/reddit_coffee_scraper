Okay, confession time... I was totally skeptical when I first heard about the *Fit To Be Pregnant Plan*. I figured it was just another “miracle” program with a shiny website and a promise to “transform your energy and glow.” 🙄 But after **30 days**, I’ve got to admit — my results blew me away (and my energy levels? Let’s just say my coffee addiction took a back seat).  

Here’s what surprised me most:  

- 🍼 **Energy levels tripled — literally.** Before starting, I was dragging my feet by noon. Now? I’m up early, focused, and actually excited to move my body again.   
- 🧘 **Mood = lifted.** My brain fog cleared, my stress went down, and my motivation shot through the roof.  
- 🥗 **The food plan is realistic.** No overpriced supplements, no “you must eat algae powder at dawn.” Just smart, clean meals designed for sustainable energy.  
- 💻 **Digital convenience.** The real cherry on top: the program is entirely digital — meaning I could dive right in from my phone, no printing, no fuss.  

👉 I grabbed my copy here: [https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/b02053741b) — and let me tell you, worth **every** penny.  

By week three, even my partner noticed how upbeat and “lighter” I felt. And here’s the kicker — I realized how much of my daily fatigue wasn’t from exhaustion but from disorganized nutrition + inconsistent habits. This plan quietly rewired that.  

### My Favorite Takeaways:  
- Bulletproof morning routine = no burnout by 2 PM.  
- Understanding macro balance meant I finally ate to *fuel* myself (not punish myself).  
- Gentle movement > aggressive workouts. Who knew walking + stretch-based routines actually energize, instead of deplete?  

If you’ve ever struggled with sluggish mornings, brain fog by lunchtime, or energy crashes before dinner, this program might just shock you in the best way possible.  

It’s not a fad. It’s a reset — rooted in sustainable, evidence-based habits.  

I’d genuinely challenge anyone curious to try it for 30 days and see what happens. (Here’s the plan again for the curious 👇)

1onwda1,https://freaktography.com/entropy-urbexhibition-urban-exploration-photography-exhibition/,My First Photography Exhibition! Entropy: Urban Exploration Photography.,"**Photo Recap & Write-Up of ""Entropy: Urban Exploration Photography Exhibition**  
  
**LONG POST ALERT!**   
  
Yesterday, I posted a [short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjH1qy54Mmg) of the opening night event of the photo exhibition dreamt up by my friend Jamie Mattiazzo, and put together with the help of many people.  
  
When Jamie had the idea, he asked me if I wanted a room to put my work in.  I was honoured to given this opportunity and I knew that I had to make it good - so my creative wheels started turning and once the ideas started rolling in, it didn't stop!  
  
Before we get to my part in the show, here'e a refresher:  
  
\*\*\*  
  
On Saturday, November 1, 2025, the NOTL Contemporary Gallery at Ironwood Cider House hosted ENTROPY – URBEXHIBITION, a one-night-only photography event celebrating the art of urban exploration and the beauty found in decay.  
  
The exhibition transformed the Niagara-on-the-Lake gallery into a visual adventure through forgotten spaces, featuring powerful imagery from some of the most talented urban exploration photographers. Each artist revealed quiet, compelling stories hidden within abandoned places and structures across North America and beyond.  
  
The evening featured photography by u/Brentsoutdoors, u/Dauntless_obscura_, u/Efp_urbex, u/FrankXPhoto, u/Freaktography, u/GLMTphotos, u/International_Adam, u/amidtheabandoned, u/Rantropolis, u/S0S1NC3R3, and u/TrueNorthUrbex.  
  
Guests also enjoyed live DJ sets by DJ Marinko and s1nc3r3, creating an immersive atmosphere that complemented the visuals on display.  
  
Presented by The NOTL Contemporary, ENTROPY – URBEXHIBITION brought together photographers, artists, and urban exploration enthusiasts for an unforgettable evening celebrating creativity, decay, and discovery.  
  
\*\*\*  
  
It was several weeks in the making, planning, selecting artists, collecting their work – my friend s0s1nc3r3 handled the brunt of that element while I was almost entirely focussed on my part of the exhibit.  
  
For my contribution, I wanted to do something entirely different, my idea was to give the visitors a sense of what it is like in an abandoned house and to experience the things that we see and that we find.  
  
First, I had to cover the walls - flip through the photos for descriptions of all of the images I selected and why.  
  
For the right side wall, I settled on three large industrial photos  at 24""x16"" from locations in Portugal, British Columbia and New York State.  
  
For the back wall, I decided to do 5 exteriors, one large eye catching photo in the middle at 24""x36"", surrounded by 4 photos at 18""x12"" from Ontario, Saskatchewan and Alberta.  
  
On the right wall, I wanted to do strictly verticals and show a representation of various types of locations all together.  I selected a jail, a power plant, a psychiatric institution, abandoned houses, a funeral home and a hotel.  
  
For the main draw and my Big Idea, I was very lucky to have made contact with the nephew of a woman who passed away several years ago, he is now the executor of her estate. The woman’s house has been abandoned for several years and in very rough shape.   
  
I asked the man if I could enter the house, capture photos of items in the house, and then bring those items into an exhibition to accompany the photos that I took. I would then return all of the items to the house at the conclusion of the show.  
  
The result was a tangible and immersive viewing experience where the visitors could see and smell the items that are actually in the photos. I left them dirty and dusty, almost exactly as they were when inside the house.  
  
He allowed me to use anything I wanted from inside the house, so I borrowed tables, a rocking chair, an old blanket and several items that I found scattered around the house. I even used the actual working lamps in the house to illuminate the photos and the items.  
  
In addition to the items that I found and photographed, I also displayed several different items that I found scattered around the house to display in the room.    
  
I wanted the viewers to see the kinds of things that we find in abandoned houses and to see them with their own eyes.  I used tables from inside the house, end tables, a hutch, a beside table and a coffee table to display the work and the relics from inside the house.  
  
Lastly, another idea that I came up with and wanted to try was for those with a sharp eye.  
  
I selected three of my photos from three separate locations that contained a door and a hallway or something in the background.  With these photos, I created a three-dimensional effect by cutting and layering the photos and lining them up inside shadow boxes.  
  
The idea worked and those who noticed it, loved it!  
  
OK, this post is already too long, I have many more photos and more write up on my website, at this blog post all about the event.  
  
So, flip through these photos where I provide some commentary on why I used certain photos, and you can see the items in the house, in my final photos and in the exhibition.

The exhibition is now free to view at the Ironwood Cider House in Niagara on the Lake, Ontario and it should be there at least until end of December.

Horrible. Guy in front of me had this super recognizable I need coffee look. Totally boring. But the boredom made me wonder: how easy is it to find a random person?

I took a super quick, sneaky shot of his profile (just the face, mostly blurry) and later that day, just for a pure pointless time waster, I ran it through a thing called faceseek.

It worked. Found his LinkedIn, his personal blog from 2008 about model trains, and a Twitter account where he mostly posts pics of his cat, Mittens. I now know Mittens is ""a fluffy menace"" and requires organic salmon treats.

Did I need this info? Nope. Is it useful? Absolutely not. Did I learn more about a random stranger than I know about some actual friends? Yep. Pointless, kinda creepy, but the tech is just ridiculously good at finding stuff you'd never find otherwise.

1onw9ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChinaMedicalSupport/comments/1onw9ck/a_beijing_oncologists_guide_to_9_hidden_cancer/,"A Beijing Oncologist's Guide to 9 ""Hidden"" Cancer Risks We Often Ignore (e.g., Kitchen Fumes, Hot Drinks, Cured Meats)","Hey Reddit,

We all see a lot of health ""hacks"" and clickbait online, and it's hard to know what's real. I came across a really practical, no-nonsense guide from a practicing oncologist in China, and some of his points were genuinely surprising. I thought it was valuable enough to translate and share.

The advice comes from Dr. Wang Shuo, a physician in the Department of Oncology at Beijing Shijitan Hospital. He broke down 9 key lifestyle risks, and they aren't all the ones you'd expect.

[A Doctor's Guide to Cancer Prevention: 9 Lifestyle Risks to Avoid | MedBridgeNZ Medical Tourism China](https://preview.redd.it/mx6dha20n5zf1.jpg?width=704&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=85f9a47bbe1c1679735db3d81cb505ded8e4460d)

We all know ""don't smoke,"" but he went deeper. Here are a few of the ones that stood out to me:

**1. ""Smoke""  - But Not Just Cigarettes...**

This was the most interesting one. He specifically called out **kitchen fumes.** When we heat cooking oil to high temperatures (like for deep-frying or even some stir-frying), it releases polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are potent carcinogens. His advice: **Always use your range hood**, and keep it running for a few minutes *after* you've finished cooking to clear the air.

**2. ""Scalding"" - Your ""Piping Hot"" Coffee/Tea**

I'm guilty of this. Dr. Wang pointed out that consuming foods and drinks *consistently* above 65°C (149°F) can cause thermal injury to the lining of your esophagus. It's not the one-time burn, but the *long-term cycle* of damage and repair that can dramatically increase the risk of esophageal cancer. He says to let that hot soup or tea cool down to just ""warm.""

**3. ""Mold"" - The ""Hidden Toxin""**

This isn't just about ""cutting off the moldy part"" of bread. He specifically mentioned **aflatoxins**, a substance produced by mold on foods like corn and peanuts, as one of the most potent liver carcinogens known. His advice is non-negotiable: If it's moldy, it's garbage. You can't ""gamble"" with it.

**4. ""Cured"" - The Preservative Problem**

This refers to things like bacon, ham, sausages, and other salted/cured meats. While delicious, they are often high in nitrites. In our stomachs, these can convert to nitrosamines, which are powerful carcinogens linked to stomach cancer. His advice was to treat these as an occasional-only food, not a daily staple.

**Why I'm sharing this:**

My work involves bridging the gap between international patients and the medical world in China (I run a **medical concierge service** called MedBridgeNZ). Because of this, I follow a lot of health and wellness insights from their top medical experts. This guide was so straightforward and practical that I wrote up a full English summary of all 9 points.

His other points cover **Sugar**, **Alcohol**, **Sun Exposure**, **Charred/Grilled Foods**, and the link between **Viruses** (like HBV/HPV) and cancer.

If you're interested in reading the full, detailed guide, you can find it on our blog:

1onw8dm,https://i.redd.it/5n0x9m6tm5zf1.jpeg,(Almost) 26 days smoke free*,"*i had one slip but more on that in a second 

Feeling pretty proud of myself! I am noticing more and more how much mental space actively smoking takes up: Always worrying about your next smoke break, how many ciggies left in the pack, if you can take a sneaky smoke break at work, if you smell, if that weird bump in your mouth is cancerous, adding time to leaving or arriving somewhere to make sure you can have a cig. 

Today, it was almost 1pm before I realized I didn’t think about smoking or use my nicotine spray. I’m also down to using the spray only once or twice a day.

Last week I smoked 1 cigarette after not smoking for 3 weeks. I’ve been getting my shit absolutely rocked by life this month and just *needed* it. So I did and it… sucked. I was hoping for that instant relief feeling but it didn’t happen, halfway through it felt like a chore. After all my problems were still there but now I just had a headache and smelled bad.  I was worried I was going to crave them after slipping but realizing how shitty I felt after was actually kind of helpful. It took away that “what if” feeling that I kept having. “What if I just had one right now, would I feel better? What if I smoke one with my morning coffee? It’ll be great”. Now I know the answer and it wasn’t what I wanted. 

One thing I keep telling myself is that ciggies weren’t actually helping me relax or de-stress, they’re not magic wands to make my problems go away. The only thing I can control right now is my ability to keep not smoking and I’m finding that super empowering. 

Good luck everyone! Be gentle with yourselves. ",2,1762224708.0,stopsmoking,0,1.0,False

Simply mesmerizing!  This fragrance is so good for this early Fall period. Wore today while running errands and to the nail salon for my manicure. Compliment given at the coffee shop I worked from this morning and one from a stranger at the nail salon.

Apparently it’s a clone of or inspired by Montale’s Arabian Tonka. It does have a sweet tonka/vanilla bean appeal, but not overwhelming. I’ve even read where some liken it to a masculine version of BR540. I don’t get that comparison.

It’s not a complex scent. Fresh in the opening, dries to the Vanilla/Tonka scent and develops powdery over time. Not complex, but also not linear. Just a great fragrance with a great value.

- Someone warm with a great smile and open to adventure!
- Down for drinks, a weekend getaway, or a movie marathon.
- A positive vibe and a “yes, and” attitude is very important.

I did about six decent hours in what should’ve been a 7.5-hour day — a couple of chats, one too many coffees, scrolled Teams a bit. Felt guilty about it, like I’d robbed the company.

Then my Gen Alpha son comes home from his side hustle, flipping knockoff watches on marketplace, and says he’s “completely cooked” after six minutes. Not seven. Not even a double digit. Just six.
Says, “Dad, I’m a 6 7 guy — I hit my limit after six, then I need recovery time.”

Meanwhile I’m sitting there feeling shame for having a lunch break longer than twelve minutes.

So I told him, “Mate, with that attitude you’re off to the Gulag.”

Without missing a beat he goes, “Cool — do they have flexible hours?”

At this point I’m not sure who’s more broken — me for feeling guilty over 6 7.5, or him for thinking 6 7 is a sustainable model.

He tried to kiss me and then apologised for it because I wasn’t ready. i told him later that day, in messages that we’re not going to gym together as we planned to because I didn’t feel good after our date. Idk I just knew something wasn’t right. The next day we met at gym, the communication was quite warm but uncomfortable (just hi and uncomfortable smiles) and he didn’t even say bye. Yet we met on Wednesday for coffee, and the rest of the week was weird. We were really touchy, even though I did not mind I came home every time and I felt used. I slowly got cold towards him, then he told me he really likes me in texts. He said he never felt anything like this to a girl (he said he was shaking when we met and it never happened before, mind you I’m 18 he’s 23). I thought that’s weird and sounds cliche, like a typical manipulation tactic. He said he’s ready to wait without knowing if I will ever like him. I said it’s okay and that I’m not comfortable with how touchy we are. I also told him I thought his intentions were purely s\*xual and he said he couldn't even think of it. The next time we saw each other he was just as touchy, I noticed it.. but idk, I ate that up because I liked it. I know I should’ve noticed this and see this huge red flag, I know. So the next week everything was really good. At that time I thought I didn’t like him that much (now I think I didn’t feel safe enough to accept it and didn’t wanna move forward). The day things changed. It was my first day of period, he was walking me home, and left half way leaving me at the park in the dark - I felt really lonely and made a big deal out of it for myself, but said nothing, he said he needed to go to work. yes I was dramatic bc of the cycle and was going home crying. I felt really bad physically, told him about it later that day on messages, he said you’re too dramatic. I cried (i;m sorry if anyone thinks I’m drama queen). The next 3 days I was really cold and we didn’t see didn’t meet, until on Thursday I said we better stop communicating( still haven't seen him from the day he left me at the park). Month later he unfollowed, but kept watching stories. And then this week, I noticed he blocked me on telegram - idk why because we were not chatting or communicating. It was a month after we stopped talking (2 weeks to be precise bc I texted him to say sorry for treating him so badly the past few days we talked)

He’s a foreigner in my country, older and more experienced than me, different mentality.

Guys just tell me whatever you think because I’m trying to process it, I've been trying to for a very long time and I need some outside perspective.

Both products served as entry-level products for me, and they've been great. Straightforward, easy to use, making solid espresso for my everyday iced latte. Recently, however, I've been wanting to upgrade, and I've been eyeing the Breville Barista Pro. I've read the posts here about the machine's built-in grinder and its pros and cons.

However, I wouldn't really classify myself as an espresso expert; I'm mainly drawn to the pro for its thermojet rapid heat-up, the convenience of having the grinder built in, and an overall quick, easy, and delicious espresso machine. And the more recent pros use Baratza grinders, which is an added perk.

I guess I'm wondering: as someone looking to upgrade while maintaining an efficient, delicious espresso process, is there another machine or setup I should absolutely consider? Or should I just go with the pro and hopefully have it for at least 8-10 years?

Suppose I truly find myself dissuaded with the grinder & becoming more of a focused espresso artist. In that case, I'd be ok down the line revisiting a separate grinder & machine, as a note. Thank you guys — I appreciate the insights!",1,1762224155.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

1onw0hf,https://www.reddit.com/r/workplace_bullying/comments/1onw0hf/retaliated_against_at_work_for_reporting_sexual/,Retaliated against at work for reporting Sexual Harassment .. what do I do?,"I’ll try and keep this as detailed and as brief as possible…

For reference, I’m a 28 year old male, I work in construction. I’ve been with the company for 10 years. I started in the field (site crew) and eventually was brought into the office to do administrative work thinking the grass would be greener…it wasn’t. 

I was surrounded by people in their 50s and 60s that had been with the company for 20-30 years and were very set in their ways. I felt very isolated and unheard at meetings, lunch, protocol ideas, etc. 

Then, one day, they hired a younger female (23) to work on our marketing and project administration tasks. I was so excited to have another “young” person in the office. At a professional level, we worked well together and became “work buddies” getting a lot accomplished which kept upper managment happy…we shared some things about our lives (like she had a BF, and how I have a GF) but at the end of the work day, we went out separate ways and didn’t interact until the next day. So everything seemed fine and dandy until the incident occurred…

One afternoon, I was having a cup of coffee in the break room when a field supervisor came in the back door. He saw me and immediately ran up to me, getting in my face with a look of excitement and yelled (he actually yelled this) “HEY! I HEAR YOU’RE FUCKING (insert female coworker name) !! I HEARD YOU’RE FUCKING HER GOOD! YEAH! I HEARD THIS FROM THE GUYS IN THE FIELD!”

I was horrified. My mouth was agape. I just stared at him. Then he repeated himself as if I didn’t hear him. After standing there, looking at him for about 30 seconds, I informed him, “that is not true, she has a boyfriend, I have a girlfriend, we literally don’t talk outside of work.” To which he followed up with “that’s not what I heard! You’re fucking her!” Mind you this is a 55 year old man.

This REALLY bothered me. So, I talked to one of my co-workers who I trusted at the time, and they urged me to bring it up to the president of the company. So I did. In return the president scolded me for bringing it up and then said “now we have to get HR involved.” And he said it in a way like it was an inconvenience to him. HR got involved and did an investigation.

They didn’t terminate the employee. Instead, they left his “punishment” up to the president. It didn’t last long because the employee spread this around the field and tried to take down other co-workers with him. A week later, he quit.

Everything seemed okay for a few days or so, then I was approached and told I was “needed back in the field.” I asked for how long, thinking it was a short term thing they needed a hand with. I wasn’t given an immediate answer.  I was confused but the next day I received my “marching orders” to go to the field at job site X.  Thinking it would be refreshing to get away from the office for a bit, I approached the day positively. However that quickly turned sour.  The field crew  (and this is no exaggeration, the carpenters and tradesmen of the company looked at my side eyed, wouldn’t come near me, aka walked away when I approached / didn’t interact with me). They avoided me. 

In my old role in the field, I would go to the shop and get materials, or documents from the office to bring out to the job site if needed. Not anymore. I’ve more or less have been demoted back to the field indefinitely, I’m not “allowed” near the office, and my superior cleaned off my desk and put my things in a box. But they didn’t fire me. 

This is, in my opinion, work place retaliation. I’ve been looking for a new job since but haven’t had luck. This situation is starting to really get to me. It’s taxing on my mental health and my social / personal life. I’ve kept a timeline and notes from the incident to now documenting it all. HR won’t do anything (and I’m saying that because we all know HR protects the company not the employee)..

My question is, what do I do? I know I’m labeled as a whistleblower, but sexual harassment in the workplace is a serious thing. I mean, do I even waste my time, energy and breath and expose the company for workplace retaliation? Or, do I just bow out gracefully as I’ve been trying to do once a new job offer comes my way? The company probably won’t be around in the next 3-5 years anyways due to retirements, lack of work, and the owners not knowing what the hell they’re doing. So I’m trying to get off the sinking ship so to speak, but can’t find a life boat. And every day at work is a living hell.

I met him in the gym, he asked my ig when we were leaving - it happened we left at the same time that day. it was on Thursday, on Friday we saw each other in the gym and he walked me home, Sunday was a first actual date - he started to get touchy and I didn’t mind. He tried to kiss me and then apologised for it because I wasn’t ready. i told him later that day, in messages that we’re not going to gym together as we planned to because I didn’t feel good after our date. Idk I just knew something wasn’t right. The next day we met at gym, the communication was quite warm but uncomfortable (just hi and uncomfortable smiles) and he didn’t even say bye. Yet we met on Wednesday for coffee, and the rest of the week was weird. We were really touchy, even though I did not mind I came home every time and I felt used. I slowly got cold towards him, then he told me he really likes me in texts. He said he never felt anything like this to a girl (he said he was shaking when we met and it never happened before, mind you I’m 18 he’s 23). I thought that’s weird and sounds cliche, like a typical manipulation tactic. He said he’s ready to wait without knowing if I will ever like him. I said it’s okay and that I’m not comfortable with how touchy we are. I also told him I thought his intentions were purely s\*xual and he said he couldn't even think of it. The next time we saw each other he was just as touchy, I noticed it.. but idk, I ate that up because I liked it. I know I should’ve noticed this and see this huge red flag, I know. So the next week everything was really good. At that time I thought I didn’t like him that much (now I think I didn’t feel safe enough to accept it and didn’t wanna move forward). The day things changed. It was my first day of period, he was walking me home, and left half way leaving me at the park in the dark - I felt really lonely and made a big deal out of it for myself, but said nothing, he said he needed to go to work. yes I was dramatic bc of the cycle and was going home crying. I felt really bad physically, told him about it later that day on messages, he said you’re too dramatic. I cried (i;m sorry if anyone thinks I’m drama queen). The next 3 days I was really cold and we didn’t see didn’t meet, until on Thursday I said we better stop communicating( still haven't seen him from the day he left me at the park). Month later he unfollowed, but kept watching stories. And then this week, I noticed he blocked me on telegram - idk why because we were not chatting or communicating. It was a month after we stopped talking (2 weeks to be precise bc I texted him to say sorry for treating him so badly the past few days we talked)



He’s a foreigner in my country, older and more experienced than me, different mentality.

Guys just tell me whatever you think because I’m trying to process it, I've been trying to for a very long time and I need some outside perspective. I wanna get over it but I see him almost daily in the gym (I can’t change the gym & can’t change the time I go there). Someone tell me why would guy block me when we don’t even talk. I remember he used to avoid me in the gym and then few days after the I saw he blocked me, he came really close (to do exercise but still)",1,1762224037.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

### Pro Tips for the Perfect Stocking Stuffer Strategy

1.  **Think Daily Routine:** What do they use every single day? A better version of that (like a nice pen or hand cream) is always a winner.
2.  **Embrace Consumables:** Gourmet coffee, fancy snacks, and bath bombs get used up and don't create clutter.
3.  **Personalize It:** An engraved initial or a gift related to an inside joke shows you put in extra thought.
4.  **Don't Forget Practicality:** A phone charger or a portable tool isn't glamorous, but it's incredibly useful and appreciated.
5.  **Group Small Items:** A few small, themed items (like ""Movie Night Kit"" with popcorn, candy, and fuzzy socks) feel like a bigger, more cohesive gift.

## Why Your Business Needs a Commercial Popcorn Machine

Before we dive into the specs, let's talk about the ""why."" Popcorn isn't just a snack; it's a financial powerhouse.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

*   **Insanely High Profit Margins:** The raw materials—kernels, oil, and salt—are incredibly inexpensive. You can see a return of 800-1000% or more on each batch sold. It's one of the highest-profit food items you can offer.
*   **Universal Appeal:** Who doesn't love popcorn? It’s a timeless snack loved by all ages, making it an easy add-on for virtually any business, from a bowling alley to a boutique hotel.

## Anatomy of a Commercial Popcorn Machine: Key Features to Understand

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

Not all popcorn poppers are created equal. Understanding these key components will help you make an informed decision.

### ### Kettle Size: The Heart of the Machine

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

This is the most important specification you'll see. Measured in ounces, the kettle size determines how much popcorn you can produce in one batch. It's not about how much it holds, but how many *raw* kernels it can pop at once.

*   **4 oz Kettle:** Perfect for low-traffic locations like a small office breakroom or a home theater. Produces about 4 quarts per batch.
*   **6 oz Kettle:** A great small-business option. Ideal for coffee shops, bars, or smaller concession stands. Produces about 6 quarts per batch.
*   **8 oz Kettle:** The workhorse of the industry. This is a popular choice for movie theaters, convenience stores, and mid-sized venues. Produces about 8 quarts per batch.
*   **12 oz Kettle and up:** Built for high-volume operations like stadiums, large amusement parks, and major event venues. These can produce over 12 quarts per batch and are designed to run continuously.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

**Pro-Tip:** Always choose a kettle size one step larger than you think you need. It's better to have extra capacity than a line of impatient customers waiting for the next batch.

### ### Popper Style: Countertop vs. Cart

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

How you serve the popcorn matters.

*   **Countertop Models:** These are designed to sit on a sturdy surface. They are perfect for permanent installations in a kitchen, behind a bar, or at a concession counter.
*   **Popcorn Carts:** These machines feature a classic, old-fashioned design on a cart with wheels. They are the ultimate mobile solution, perfect for catering events, farmers' markets, and outdoor festivals. They create a fantastic visual attraction.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

### ### Heating Method: Gas vs. Electric

*   **Electric Popcorn Machines:** The most common type. They simply plug into a standard outlet. They are easy to use, clean, and maintain, making them ideal for most indoor locations.
*   **Gas Popcorn Machines:** These run on propane or natural gas. They heat up faster and are often more powerful, making them a favorite for outdoor vendors or locations without reliable electricity. They require more ventilation and safety precautions.

## How to Choose the Right Machine for Your Business

Ready to shop? Ask yourself these four questions:

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

1.  **What's my expected volume?** Refer back to the kettle size guide. Be honest about how much you'll sell, especially during peak hours.
2.  **Where will I be using it?** This dictates whether you need a mobile **popcorn cart** or a stationary **countertop popcorn machine**. For indoor use, electric is usually best. For outdoor or mobile use, a gas-powered cart might be the answer.
3.  **What's my budget?** A small **commercial popcorn machine** can start around a few hundred dollars, while large, feature-rich models can run into the thousands. Determine what you can afford, but remember that this is an investment that should pay for itself quickly.
4.  **What are the essential features?** Look for quality materials like stainless steel and tempered glass. A built-in ""warming deck"" is crucial to keep popcorn fresh and crispy. An ""old-maid drawer"" is a handy feature that collects unpopped kernels for easy disposal.

## Beyond the Machine: Supplies and Maintenance

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

Your popper is just the start. To create that perfect movie-theater taste, you'll need the right supplies.

*   **Mushroom-Style Popcorn Kernels:** These pop into large, round balls perfect for holding coatings and looking full in a bag.
*   **Coconut Oil:** This is the secret ingredient for that authentic movie theater flavor and aroma.
*   **Flavored Salts:** Go beyond just salt! Butter-flavored, cheesy, and spicy seasonings can expand your menu.
*   **Bags and Boxes:** Have a variety of sizes ready for your customers.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

For maintenance, always follow the manufacturer's instructions. A simple routine of wiping down the glass after each use and cleaning the kettle with a dedicated kettle cleaner after your shift will keep your **commercial popcorn machine** running perfectly for years.

## Ready to Start Popping?

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=commercial%20popcorn%20machine)

The guy working was nice. I was looking for the 24hr Tin briefcase in green, but they didn't have it. Guy offers to order it for me so I said sure. 

I pay my 400 bucks. Guy says ""it'll ship in 3, maybe 4 days. From the in store order it will ship faster."" Mind you, the website says shipping options are ""fast, faster, fastest"".... 2 day shipping was 25 dollars but it wasn't offered to me in store to buy that. 

October by that next Wednesday I email customer service cause I hadn't even got an order confirmed email etc. Just the receipt. No answer. Friday, 7 whole days later, I call in. ""Just wanted to see if there's any update..."" girl on the phone says 

""OH it looks like it shipped! Did you not get the tracking email?""

""Nope. Didn't get any email."" 

""OH. Well. It shipped.... did you want the tracking number??"" 

Yes.... yes I would. 

Items from Filson, a Seattle company I guess ship from Mississippi now? It's full on snail mail... usps economy mail. It says estimated arrival is today, the 3rd. I wake up in the morning, drinking my coffee and check shipping. 6am today, left the aurora Colorado post office. A few hours later, got updated to show Wednesday 9pm is the arrival. 

It's honestly just lame lol. That will mark almost 2 weeks for a delivery. That's unacceptable to me. This isn't some small time mom and pop shop, this is the premier Filson outfitter. Their customer service sucked, shipping times suck, I have half a mind just to return it.

I feel that we are in a tough financial time as a country, so everything is continuously going up in price. I don’t know if that’s the company fault either, because they’re trying to stay afloat too. But $5 is just crazy… am I wrong? Should I just never go back again and stay silent? What if everyone started reviewing overpriced companies worse than this?

Other than this, what about reviews about companies that ridiculously underpay their workers? I’m talking about paralegals making minimum wage at the firm and working two jobs. Don’t future clients have the right to know a company undervalues their workers? Personally, if I found out a company was underpaying their workers, I would start comparing other options.

What if a CEO has done a questionable act, and I am reviewing one of their companies or local branches? Is it relevant in a review? Is it accountability?

Don’t get me started on $7 coffee.

Is this an effective way to give power back to consumers? Can google intervene and take these reviews down? Is it useless and overstepping, and should we let companies just do what they want on our end?

We got close quite quickly, we have the same sense of humour, agree on a lot of the same things and there just generally is a connection between us I can not explain or put my finger on. Everyone who knows us both can not understand what I see in him but there is something I see that no one else does.

Comments on how close we were have been made, how much we got on and even made comments to me about how much he clearly liked me. I always passed this off as others reading into something that wasn’t there, we were friends and we just got on really well. We never even spoke to each other outside of work.

Fast forward a year or so and something seemed to shift between us. I couldn’t explain what started it or how it came to be as it happened so naturally. We started flirting more, we spoke out of work and people started picking up on feelings we didn’t think we were making obvious. I was told when I walk in the office they noticed his eyes immediately fell on me, was told when I am not there all he does is speak about me. He even knew the date we first started working together so knew how long ago we’d met. I was even told by those who mutually know his still girlfriend (29F) who I think he has been with for 8yrs that she had asked who I was so it was clear he had spoken about me at home in whatever capacity. I put all this down to work place gossip and people having nothing better to do then entertain themselves with a soap opera of other people’s lives. I was told the smile on my face when I saw him said it all, that anything he asked me for wasn’t a case of I’ll do it when I have time it was immediate I did anything he asked even as simple as dropping everything to make him a drink (at this point I know what coffee he drinks/ how many sugars/ even how many times a day).

Things progressed and we sent messages we should not have sent being in relationships to each other and it went on for months. Nothing physical happened but he told me he loved me and if I left my partner he would leave his so we could be together. I declined the offer. He has moved to another branch of the company now so we don’t see each other and my feelings began to fade I put it down to lust for someone I saw all the time and found attractive.

We went to a company event last week and it was the first time we had seen each other in a long time and all the feelings I thought had faded came back. He looked good, we gravitated to each other like we had before and again it feels so natural to do so. He made it clear he still has some feelings towards me, that if he was not in a relationship with his girlfriend I would be who he wanted.

Now I can not stop over thinking it, I am sure he is aware of how I feel as much as I try to down play it. I try to tell myself he is playing his feelings off to as he has said he values me as a friend but I don’t act how I do with my other male friends as I do with him and I doubt he acts with his female friends how he does with me.

We are both in relationships and I do love my partner (32M) we have been together 4yrs. We have a nice life together, he truly loves me and I know he does people would only dream of having someone love me the way my partner loves me but I still think about this other guy.

TLDR - I (30F) have feelings for someone else (33M) other than my partner (32M) lol. It was made clear the feelings were reciprocated at one stage but not anymore. I still feel the same and I am torn.

1onvqay,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1onvqay/theres_only_one_rule_to_remember_if_you_see_the/,There’s only one rule to remember if you see the Buttonhook Men: don’t tell a soul they exist.,"They’ll disappear you.

And for breaking this rule, I’ll soon find out where their victims go. I won’t be able to outrun them.

After all, they’re not really ‘men’ at all.

A buttonhook is a handheld aid with a curved hook at one end and a handle at the other; it fastens and unfastens unyielding buttons. That’s all. It’s not an exciting invention. Not even a particularly well-known one. Certainly not sinister in the slightest.

But, you know, even the most mundane of tools can do far-from-mundane things in wilful hands.

For context, I learnt about the immigration officers of Ellis Island in history class. Men who used buttonhooks to intrusively inspect prospective American citizens for trachoma; a contagious eye disease that resulted in blindness when left untreated. Eyelids were peeled back like fruit skin. A ghastly procedure.

These immigration officers became known as the buttonhook men, and they were feared by those being processed on the island. That’s a horror story in itself, but not the one I’m here to tell.

No, this is the story of the unearthly creatures my friends and I came to call the Buttonhook Men, influenced by our recent history lesson. These creatures have been disappearing people in my hometown, which I’ll call Noplace, for 29 years.

Bear in mind that the original buttonhook men of Ellis Island were just that: men. And men die. It’s *ideas* that live. Stories. Monsters. Only, these aren’t the fictional kind. They’re real, no matter how much you might want them not to be; and if you think they won’t come for you, God save your soul.

Because this is bigger than my hometown. None of us will be safe for long.

First, they come for someone else.

Next, they come for *you*.

Noplace is a fourth-rate crap-heap and always has been, but our economy really nose-dived in the nineties. Of course, my friends and I were too young to understand why. We didn’t know or care about austerity. About powerful men who bled the working class, the middle class, and even some of the upper class.

It’s a confusing thing, the way the world works. That’s why most of us simply choose not to study the mechanisms. We only really give a hoot when life becomes expensive. Hard. And isn’t it the darnedest thing that those responsible always make sure we point our fingers at each other?

That was what broke Noplace in 1998, when I was eleven years old.

And by the time the Buttonhook Men arrived, it was already too late.

Tom, Pari, Julianne, and I called ourselves the Fun Four back then. We looked out for one another. Pari, mostly. She was born in Noplace, but her mother, Samira, moved here from India in the late eighties; pregnant, recently widowed, and in catastrophic straits. She upheaved her life to survive. To ensure her soon-to-be-born girl would survive.

Pari had a good life, mostly. She caught a few racist remarks here and there, but the Fun Four looked out for her. The trouble started to brew in ‘95 with the unveiling of Noplace’s mega-mart. It quickly drove local shops out of business. And when the supermarket hired Samira, it was easy for Noplace citizens to blame her. The brown-skinned cashier.

Life became scary for them, but fear came for us all on December 20^(th) 1998.

That night, in Pari’s bedroom, the Fun Four watched films on a bulky box-television. It was a distraction sleepover. See, whilst we were upstairs, Pari’s mother was being interrogated by Constable Harrison in the kitchen. Noplace’s police constable was a nice-mannered man, but a weak one. Despite his pleasantries and platitudes, he had no backbone.

Case in point: Harrison was following up on a baseless accusation made by Mrs Bradshaw, whose husband’s bakery went under in ‘97. An accusation that Samira had used falsified information when applying for British citizenship nearly twelve years earlier.

That was a lie.

“What film next?” I asked.

Pari shrugged. “I don’t care, Joshua. Anything. Just…” The tears made their entrance. “They’re gonna make us move to India.”

Tom frowned. “But you’re not even *from* India.”

“Doesn’t matter. Mrs Bradshaw called us ‘foreign muck’, and everybody agrees.”

“Well, *I* don’t,” Julianne said. “And my brother told me Mrs Bradshaw got a Brazilian Butt Lift a few years earlier. Should we ask the policeman to send that ‘foreign muck’ back too?”

Tom and I chuckled, and Pari came close.

An hour later, once the constable had finished his interrogation and left, Samira came up to Pari’s room.

“Bedtime now,” she said, then she nodded at Tom and me. “You two will go in the spare room. Julianne, you’ll sleep in here with Pari.”

Tom got to his feet. “Yes, ma’am.”

“I’m special,” Julianne whispered to me, and I nudged her in the ribs.

Pari began, “Mum, what did—”

“Not now, beti,” her mother said, before nodding more sternly at me. “*Bedtime*, Joshua. It’s nine o’clock.”

“Sorry,” I said, getting to my own feet and joining Tom at the door; I turned back before shutting it, and smiled softly at Pari. “It’ll be okay, Paz.”

She said nothing. Instead, my friend sniffled, burrowed beneath her duvet, and flicked off the bedside lamp. Julianne remained on the carpet in that dimly moonlit room, and she spoke to me with a shrug; *I don’t know what to do to make all of this better*, it said. I returned with a nod because I didn’t know either.

A still-sobbing Samira closed her daughter’s door, then led Tom and I across the upstairs landing. As she opened the door to the spare room, I thought of something warm to say. Something that might dry her eyes. But before I had a chance, Pari’s mother let out a faint croak of horror and shot her arms sideways.

She was bracing Tom and me from something ahead.

Something in the blackness of her bedroom doorway at the end of the corridor.

It was black unlike any other black. I don’t know how else to put it, just as I don’t know whether I turned cold as the result of Samira’s sudden movement or as the result of being eyed by that doorway’s colourless cavity.

Whatever the case, I feared it more than anything else in the world.

“What’s wrong, ma’am?” was Tom’s timid question.

Samira stood still and answered with a shake of her head, but she did not twist to face us. I didn’t like that. And the longer we stood there, staring into that dark doorframe, the more assured I became that—

*Something is staring back at us*.

“Ma’am,” Tom pressed, tugging on Samira’s sleeve to get a response. “What’s in—”

“There’s nothing in the doorway, Thomas,” she said before he finished the question.

Then, as Samira started to shepherd us into the spare room, I glimpsed something.

A silver curl glinting from the black of the doorway.

I thought I’d imagined it, but as Pari’s mother closed the door on Tom and me, I heard him whisper—

“Buttonhook…”

I knew exactly what Tom was referencing. Ellis Island. The buttonhook men. But he had to be wrong, I decided. *It was a trick of the light*.

“It was a buttonhook man,” Tom said. “From the photos Mr Langton showed us.”

I shook my head. “No. Shut up. It wasn’t anything. It was—”

“Go to bed, boys,” Samira said from the other side of the door, “*and do not leave this room*.”

There followed creaks of floorboards as Pari’s mother crept along the hallway towards her bedroom. And then nothing. Not the sound of Samira shutting her bedroom door. Just nothing. No noise at all.

“What’s going on?” Tom said.

“Don’t…” I warned fruitlessly, knowing my friend too well.

But he had already pushed down the handle and opened the bedroom door. Tom was the smartest of the Fun Four, but *stupidly* brave. He had no survival instincts. I begrudgingly chased him onto the upstairs landing, and we stopped under the glow of the orange light overhead. We eyeballed the black of Samira’s bedroom.

On the carpet before that threshold were her fluffy white slippers.

And red droplets.

“W… What is that…?” I whimpered, knowing full well that it was blood.

“Something’s happened to her…” Tom said. “We need to do something… *We need to tell someone!*”

The moment he uttered that final word, there sounded a dissonant clink from Samira’s room. Tom looked at me, ready to ‘do something’ and ‘tell someone’, and I merely whimpered with great dread as I looked over his shoulder at the doorway.

The dark from within was spreading without.

It gushed out of the doorframe and towards us. A black stream through a ravine of white walls.

*There’s nothing in the doorway*, Samira had promised. Well, I’d known that was a lie. Known Tom was right.

We hadn’t imagined the glint of silver.

As the darkness engulfed us, nearly entirely extinguishing the light above, Tom turned on his heel. The two of us faced the black of the doorway.

*Faced the figure emerging from it.*

It wasn’t a man, much as the silver tip of his appendage wasn’t a buttonhook, or a hand, or anything remotely of our world. But I needed a frame of reference to stop my terrified mind from unravelling entirely, so I accepted Tom’s name: this was a buttonhook man, like the ones from Ellis Island.

The thing was cloaked in shade which sloshed from its black portal and nearly drowned the lightbulb entirely. I was glad of that. What I *could* see was already too much. This bipedal thing, with limbs tapering off into keen silver tips, each bearing a slight curve, may have had a face. A mouth. Eyes. But maybe not. I tried not to look too closely. Tried only to drag Tom back into the bedroom.

He resisted, of course.

“Where is she?” my friend asked.

The Buttonhook Man answered by wrapping bladed limbs like a noose around Tom’s neck and hoisting the boy into the air.

“Don’t kill me!” he wailed.

The creature obliged.

It uncoiled one of its silvery extremities from Tom’s throat, then surgically jabbed at his eyes. My friend screeched louder as the Buttonhook Man blinded him. And I screeched, selfishly, as I presumed myself to be next.

When the creature finished plucking out Tom’s eyes, I prayed a silent prayer for it to be over. For the inhuman thing to slink back into the shadows. But the Buttonhook Man put its silver appendage to work again, this time driving a hook up Tom’s nostril and having a rootle; fishing deeply up into my friend’s head.

What horrified me most was that Tom’s moans of terror quickly devolved. Became moans of confusion. Moans of vegetative nothingness. And then the Buttonhook Man removed its pointed limb to reveal what must have been grey matter from Tom’s skull.

My once wise, though admittedly foolhardy, friend had been rendered a lobotomised husk.

He presumably shuffled past me, down the stairs, and out of the door. But the terrible truth is that I don’t remember. I was in shock. Near catatonic. I don’t remember what became of him. I don’t know where he went. I know only that he’s not been seen since that day in 1998 because I wasn’t registering anything. I was thinking only—

*RUN. I HAVE TO RUN.*

Which the Buttonhook Man proved to be true as it slashed a silver limb-end my way.

The thing lacerated my forearm, drawing a gash from my wrist up to my elbow and an agonised yelp from my core. The scar stays with me to this day. The feeling of that cold appendage icing not only the flesh and the bone below, but my very heart. It felt, for a moment, as if I had been changed not only physically but emotionally.

As if I had become a husk of a person, blind to empathy.

Blind to any human thought or feeling.

Pulling back from the lurching creature, I gunned for Pari’s room, tore open her door, and slammed it behind me. As pounding came from the other side, I turned to find myself in another moonlit space bearing an unfolding scene of horror.

Pari was lying in bed, screaming up at the face of another Buttonhook Man towering above her. Silver e reaching towards her, speaking the unspoken threat of *disappearance*. Sending her wherever her mother had been sent.

Julianne was sitting on the carpet with arms around her legs. She rocked back and forth. Watched helplessly as Pari seemed poised to meet her end at the hooks of the creature from the black.

“It says my… my mum is… She’s…” Pari didn’t finish any of her sentences.

Julianne crawled over the floor towards me and tugged at my hand. “We need to… to go…”

I nodded and looked at the Buttonhook Man, whose attention had shot to Julianne and me: the two loose ends threatening to escape. With that, I understood this creature. Well, of course, I didn’t understand it. It was a horror from another world; one I wouldn’t possibly ever hope to understand. But I understood Tom’s fatal flaw.

He had threatened to tattle.

“Please just let us leave with her,” I begged the Buttonhook Man. “We won’t tell a soul what we saw. I promise.”

I don’t know whether it understood me. Don’t know whether it even spoke our language. But I do know that the ‘man’ observed me for a second. Recognised my cowardice. Recognised that I was telling the truth: in that moment, I *truly* intended to never tell a soul.

A promise I have only broken now, after nearly three decades.

The bedroom light burst to life, and the Buttonhook Men vanished with the dark.

But the Fun Four survived that night in body only.

Tom never showed up, no matter how hard the police searched. Pari ended up in a psychiatric ward, fractured by both the disappearance of her mother and what experts called ‘delusions’ of Buttonhook Men. My cousin, Wesley, still lives in Noplace. He says Julianne’s the town drunk these days. She works as a plumber, and a damn bad one.

As for me, I’ve lived overseas for twenty years, and I’ve teetered on being committed to psychiatric wards myself. Who would believe my story? Who would believe the supernatural things I saw that night? Well, people in Noplace, apparently. I’ve heard things over the years. Stories from Wesley. Disappearances of other citizens. Strange sightings in dark doorways. Unearthly things.

I didn’t used to care. Noplace was on the other side of the world from me.

But now it’s happening everywhere. People are going missing. That’s why I’m sharing my story here. You see, I’ve been seeing *them* again. In doorways. In the shade. Glints of silver. Outlines of things far from men. They’re not upholding the deal, so what’s the use in keeping hush anymore? What’s the use in keeping my promise?

The Buttonhook Men are coming for us all.

I realised that yesterday when my elderly neighbour, a sweet French lady named Susie, said familiar words over coffee.

“There’s nothing in the doorway.”

My heart seized in fear, much as it did back in ‘98, but not as sharply as it did this morning.

Susie has disappeared.

They’re not just in Noplace. Maybe they never were.

So, I’m currently about to board a flight back to my hometown. Back to see Wesley and make heads and tails of this horror.

Before it makes me disappear too.

Before I find out where those people went.

We are both in relationships and I do love my partner (32M) we have been together 4yrs. We have a nice life together, he truly loves me and I know he does people would only dream of having someone love me the way my partner loves me but I still think about this other guy.

TLDR - I (30F) have feelings for someone else (33M) other than my partner (32M) lol. It was made clear the feelings were reciprocated at one stage but not anymore. I still feel the same and I am torn.

Have I fallen for someone who clearly has no interest in me or should I end my relationship and make my feelings for him (33M) clear and see if he does feel the same way?",0,1762223214.0,relationship_advicePH,1,0.33,False

1onv8vn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Arrowverse/comments/1onv8vn/au_story_the_violet_knight_part_11/,AU Story: The Violet Knight Part 11,"​Team Emerald pulled into the underground motor pool just as Waller, overconfident and flanked by armed guards, was leading her motley crew to their transport. Deadshot was the first to notice the sleek black car. He smirked, leaning against a large Military RV. “Looks like the heroes figured you out, Waller. Slipping in your old age.”

​The Batmobile’s canopy hissed open, and Batgirl stepped out, flanked by Arrowette, Raven and Terra. The four girls, dressed in their costumes, stood shoulder-to-shoulder, angry, defiant, and completely grounded.

​Ellie stepped forward. ""So, you decided to play with the chess pieces, Waller?""

​Waller merely glared, unimpressed. ""After Luthor sent loose a giant monster? The government isn’t waiting around for the League to get him. Get back in your toy car and go home.""

​Mia stepped forward, her new hand flexing. ""Well, maybe if the 'government' got off its lazy ass and took care of the villains after we caught them, there wouldn't be any more psychopaths running around!""

​Captain Boomerang threw back his head and chuckled. ""Kid's gotta point!""

​Ellie ignored the exchange, focusing her cold, determined gaze on Waller. “Waller, you have two options. Option 1: The four of us accompany your squad to make sure they don't deviate, detonate, or make the Zynothium leak into the atmosphere. Option 2: We shut this whole little operation down right now, and you explain yourself to an angry, fully-formed Justice League about your plan to deploy bombs next to a dimension-shifting energy source.""

​The villains, including Bane and Captain Cold, burst into raucous laughter at the visual of Waller having to face an angry League debriefing. The pressure point worked perfectly.

​Waller’s jaw tightened. She knew a standoff against four determined heroes, who had the backing of the League, was unwinnable on government property. “Fine,” she said through gritted teeth. “You ride along. My rules, my authority. You are strictly monitored.”

​Ellie tapped her gauntlet twice, sending a secure command. The Batmobile’s engine revved softly, and it silently drove itself back into the shadows of the garage, returning to the Batcave.

​“Oooh, we get to play with Batsy & Arrow’s babies and their two little friends!” Harley cheered, skipping toward the RV.

The interior of the Military RV was cramped and smelled faintly of stale coffee and gunpowder. Deadshot was behind the wheel, Team Emerald were crammed into the bench seats, facing the six of the villains.

​Ellie, in her Batgirl cowl, pulled her knees up to her chest and surveyed the group. She didn't look scared; she looked intensely irritated.
​“Let’s establish some ground rules since we’re sharing a rental,” Ellie said, her voice amplified slightly by her cowl's comm system. “The goal is to stop the Zynothium and neutralize Luthor’s facility. Nothing else. No detours, no personal vendettas, and absolutely no trying to detach your neck bombs with a Swiss Army knife.”

​Captain Cold leaned forward, a cynical smirk playing on his lips. “And why, exactly, should seven professional criminals with explosive collars listen to you four?”

​Ellie didn’t answer immediately. Instead, she tapped a control on her gauntlet. Suddenly, a high-resolution, holographic video shimmered into existence in the center of the cramped RV space. It was a short, heavily edited clip from the dark night Batman and the Joker died.

​The video was chaotic: the shattered remains of Arkham’s main security hub, flickering lights, and a table piled high with confiscated fear toxin vials. The faces of Ellie and Sara were obscured by static filters, but their bodies and voices were clear. The camera angle made the villains feel like they were standing right there.

​The villains watched in stunned silence as the holographic figures played out the horrific scene:
​White Canary: ""What are you doing, Batgirl?""

​Batgirl: (Her voice was cold, flat, and chillingly broken.) ""These animals need to be reminded to stay in their cages!"" She reached for a vial of concentrated fear toxin.

​White Canary: (Stepping into her path.) ""What if they don't?""

​Batgirl: (A terrible calmness in her voice.) ""Then they'll find out!!!""

​The villains, even seasoned killers like Deadshot and Bane, felt a collective chill slide down their spines at the sheer, contained madness in Batgirl's tone. It was a threat that promised a slaughter.

​White Canary: (Her voice is firm but full of pain.) ""I'm not going to let you paint the walls of Arkham red, Cubbie.""

​The video ended with Batgirl slowly withdrawing her hand from the fear toxin and walking away, leaving the vials untouched. The hologram flickered out. A profound, heavy silence filled the RV. Ellie stood up, closing the space between herself and the villains. She stepped directly in front of Harley Quinn, her masked face inches from Harley's.

​“That is where your ex-boyfriend pushed me that night, Harley,” Ellie stated, her voice returning to its normal, controlled register, but carrying the weight of the video. “If it wasn't for White Canary, I would've marched right into Gotham and dealt with every single criminal in a way that would make the League lock me up forever.”

​Ellie then turned to the three villains from Central and Star City, Boomerang, Cold, and Cupid. ""And I would have probably moved right into your prisons as well, ensuring you never saw the light of day again.""
​She didn't need to threaten them with the bombs. She had threatened them with her.

​Poison Ivy broke the silence, her eyes wide with a mixture of respect and fear. “She’s not kidding. That level of focus… that’s darker than anything in this RV.” Ivy leaned back, giving Ellie a slow, measured nod. ""Alright, we will follow your lead.”

Ellie's gaze, intense and unyielding, softened slightly. The cold, chilling resolve left her posture, and she looked specifically at Harley Quinn, who was unusually quiet and subdued.

​""And Harley?"" Ellie asked, her voice returning to her normal register.

​Harley, now genuinely shaken after seeing Batman's daughter nearly turn into a killer, quietly asked, ""Yeah, baby Bat?""

​Ellie leaned back against the seat, her voice clear and low. ""I made sure your sister, her husband, and your daughter are safe. Luthor can't get to them.""

​Harley’s eyes, wide with fresh fear, suddenly snapped into focus, and a flood of relief washed over her face. ""Lucy's safe? Oh, thank goodness."" She deflated a little, resting her head against the wall, the tension leaving her shoulders in a visible rush.

​Ellie turned her gaze to Floyd, whose eye behind the mask was unreadable. ""I did the same thing for your daughter, Floyd. She's secure. No one can use her as leverage against you or this mission.""

​Floyd didn't say anything, but the slight, involuntary intake of breath, a tiny hitch in his professional composure was all the answer Ellie needed. The realization that Luthor had lost his most valuable bargaining chips settled over the mercenary, a silent wave of relief that his child, Zoey, was safe.

​Ellie finished, her voice returning to the firm, commanding tone. ""We are now working together because we all want the same thing: Luthor neutralized and our futures secured. That starts with compliance.""

​The RV continued its journey through the night, filled now with a new layer of complexity: fear mixed with a grudging, tactical gratitude. The villains were on a leash, not just of steel and explosives, but of professional respect and deep, personal obligation.

The heavy military RV sped down a deserted, isolated highway outside Metropolis, kicking up dust and gravel. The atmosphere inside was a toxic mix of adrenaline and grudging compliance. Deadshot drove with the cool efficiency of a pilot, ignoring the six explosive collars and the four superheroes crammed behind him. Waller sat rigid in the passenger seat, issuing commands to Gideon via her headset.

​Batgirl, positioned near the back door, watched the GPS map on her gauntlet, the red marker of Luthor’s suborbital launch facility growing closer.

​“We’re three minutes out from the designated perimeter,” Batgirl announced. “We should be encountering security measures at any moment. Stay tight, and remember the rules: defense only until we reach the objective.”

​“Defense is boring,” Harley Quinn complained, bouncing in her seat. “Can’t we have just a tiny bit of offense? Just a little taste?”

​Before anyone could answer, Deadshot cursed. ""Contact. Two fast movers, closing at ten o'clock.""

​A sudden, high-pitched whine sliced through the air. Two black, heavily armored LexCorp hover-drones, bristling with energy cannons, appeared over the tree line, immediately targeting the RV.
​The first energy blast slammed into the side panel with a deafening CRANG, tearing a long strip of metal and making the entire vehicle swerve violently.

​""Waller, they're not using standard ordinance!"" Batgirl yelled over the chaos. ""They're targeting the vehicle structure. They know what this thing is!""

​""Focus on neutralizing the threat, Batgirl!"" Waller commanded, unmoved by the danger.
​
​“Captain Cold! Your turn!” Batgirl shouted, taking charge.

​Captain Cold, surprisingly swift, slid open a small firing slit near the RV's rear. He aimed his cold gun, not at the drones, but at the road itself. A wave of absolute zero energy hit the highway twenty feet behind them, instantly flash-freezing the pavement.

​“Have a nice slip, metal buckets!” Cold drawled, closing the slit.
​The drones, reacting to the slick surface, faltered in their pursuit, forced to stabilize and slow their attack pattern.

​“Arrowette, take the stabilizers!” Batgirl ordered.

​Arrowette quickly rolled down the back window. Using the momentary pause, she fired two precise, titanium-tipped arrows. The arrows hit the primary rotors of the trailing drone, disabling its stabilization and sending it tumbling into the frozen embankment in a shower of sparks.
​The remaining drone banked sharply, firing a rapid barrage of kinetic rounds.

​“Bane! Shield!” Batgirl commanded.
​Bane, huge and terrifying even in his scrubs, moved without question. He wrenched a loose piece of sheet metal from the wall of the RV and braced it with one massive arm, the kinetic rounds pinging harmlessly off the impromptu shield.

​“Poison Ivy! Distraction!” Batgirl continued. ""Can you reach the ground?""

​Ivy extended a hand and, with a subtle shift in bio-energy, caused a dense thicket of invasive weeds and thorny vines to burst from the earth near the drone's flight path. The drone was momentarily entangled, slowing its aim.

​“Terra! Ground it!” commanded Batgirl.

​Terra slammed her hands down on the metal floor. The concrete beneath the drone’s path bucked and crumbled, sending up a massive plume of dust and debris that completely obscured the target.

​“Deadshot! End this!” Batgirl finished.

​Floyd Lawton, who had been driving one-handed while simultaneously maintaining his focus, smoothly shifted the RV into a hard turn. He whipped his wrist out the driver’s side window, firing a single, ricocheting wrist-mounted round. The bullet, guided by instinct, bounced off the nearby guardrail and plunged directly into the drone’s exposed optical sensor. The drone spiraled, hitting the ground in a final, fiery explosion.

​The RV kept going, only slightly damaged, leaving the wrecks of the drones behind them.
​The seven villains, breathing heavily, stared at the four girls. They had executed a perfectly choreographed defensive maneuver that utilized every single one of their powers, directed by a single voice.

​“Well done, team,” Batgirl said, her voice surprisingly devoid of sarcasm. 

“That’s what cooperation looks like.”
​Captain Cold wiped a bead of sweat from his brow. ""Cooperation, Batgirl, or a masterclass in tactical hostage management? Either way, you have our attention.""

​Deadshot glanced into the rearview mirror, his voice a low grunt of reluctant respect. “She calls the shots, Waller. You just point us at the target.”

​Waller, her eyes narrowed, simply nodded, acknowledging the undeniable efficiency of the young heroes.

The military RV screeched to a halt half a mile from the suborbital launch facility. The area was surrounded by LexCorp militia, high-tech sensors, and defensive turrets. Batgirl, fully in command, utilized the RV's minimal electronic warfare suite to blind a small section of the perimeter.

​“Arrowette, Cupid. Boomerang, secure the east flank. Captain Cold, flash freeze the main entry hydraulics, make it accessible, not destroyed. Ivy, Bane, you’re breaching with Terra and Raven. Remember: Painful, non-lethal, incapacitation only. If a bone breaks, I want it to be Luthor’s, not his security.”

​The team executed the strategy with terrifying efficiency. Bane, directed by Terra who pinpointed structural weak points, tore through a reinforced wall, but instead of crushing the guards inside, he used controlled bursts of Venom to overload their adrenal systems, leaving them screaming in agony but alive. Arrowette, Cupid and Captain Boomerang worked together, the archers using net arrows while Boomerang used precise, non-returning shots to knock out communication gear and stun guards.

​Poison Ivy coated the remaining militia’s body armor with rapidly hardening sap, immobilizing them where they stood. They found Lex Luthor in the control center, finalizing the launch sequence for the Zynothium device.

​Luthor, smug and confident, was quickly subdued. Captain Cold froze his arms to the console, while Arrowette put an arrow neatly through the primary launch trigger, disabling the countdown. The Zynothium, glowing with unstable, multi-dimensional energy, was sealed in its protective casing by Raven’s dark magic, making it inert, the mission was a success.
​
​Before the League could even send a reconnaissance drone, Amanda Waller arrived with a fleet of military vehicles. She moved with ruthless efficiency, collecting the bound villains and supervising the careful extraction of the Zynothium device.
​Ellie watched as her temporary allies were loaded back into their transport. Deadshot gave her a fractional, almost invisible nod of respect.

​“You’ve broken every rule of your grounding, Batgirl,” Waller stated, standing over Ellie.

​“And saved your government a massive headache, Waller,” Ellie countered, tapping her gauntlet. “My ride is here.”

​The sleek, familiar silhouette of the Batplane dropped into the clearing. Team Emerald quickly boarded, leaving Waller to take the public credit.

​Within the hour, news reports dominated every global network: ""US Military Special Forces Unit Captures Lex Luthor and Detains Zynothium Chemical."" The League and the Titans watched the sanitized reports from their various bases, their jaws collectively dropping.

​Moments later, a simultaneous, encrypted audio conference call cut into Titans Tower, the Arrowcave, the Waverider, the DEO, and the Star Labs Cortex.

​Waller’s voice, smug and amplified, filled the rooms.
​“Do you like what you see, heroes?” she asked, a smirk audible in her tone.

​Dick was the first to speak. “You sent your villain Task Force in! You compromised the entire operation and put those girls at risk!”

​“It wasn’t just those criminals, Nightwing,” Waller corrected, letting the revelation sink in. “Batgirl, Arrowette, Raven, and Terra showed up and took command. I’ll admit making a mistake by not taking care of the Arkham cameras, which allowed Batgirl to see what I was up to. However, those girls got the criminals to do something I’ve never been able to: use controlled, non-lethal force.”

​Clark, who was at the DEO, asked, with confusion in his voice, “How? How did the girls manage that level of control over Bane and Deadshot?”

​Waller chuckled, the sound grating. “Batgirl showed them a very short, very private video from the night Batman and the Joker died, the moment White Canary stopped Batgirl from going on a rampage. The criminals realized the worst thing that would happen if they disobeyed wasn't dealing with my detonator, but dealing with the tiny girl wearing a purple and gold armored suit in the RV with them.” 

Her voice grew cold, delivering the final, devastating analysis,​“There’s a reason, Nightwing, Superman, and the rest of you, why Batman and Green Arrow were the leaders of your League. They knew what needed to get done to complete the mission, something they taught their little girls. Look, Luthor and the Zynothium are detained, and no bodies were dropped. That’s a win for both our sides.”

​Waller disconnected the line. The heroes were left in stunned silence, grappling with the uncomfortable truth that the League's next generation had just proven themselves terrifyingly effective.

The massive, brightly lit living room of Wayne Manor felt unusually small. The entire leadership was present: Dick and Kori stood near the fireplace, their expressions weary but unyielding; Sara stood beside them, her posture radiating controlled anxiety. Opposite them were the League pillars, Clark, Kara, and Barry Allen, their presence lending an impossible weight to the atmosphere.

Ellie, Mia, Rachel, and Tara walked down the grand staircase together. Despite their fear, their unity was visible: all four wore their pajamas, and each girl instinctively reached up, touching the silver chains around their necks. The heart pendants, the Amethyst, Emerald, Sapphire, and Amber gemstones fused together, served as their silent, defiant shield.

They stopped before the heroes, standing shoulder-to-shoulder.
Ellie spoke first, her Batgirl steel shining through the nervousness. “Look, we know you all are probably angry, and we know we broke the grounding rules that you all established. But when we saw Waller collecting those criminals, we knew bodies were about to get dropped. The mission would have failed, and collateral damage would have been a guarantee.”

Mia stepped slightly forward. “So we took control to make sure no one died. We led the assault, and we made sure every single incapacitation was non-lethal, even though we had seven killers on our side who were eager to do otherwise.”

Rachel continued, her gaze directed at the floor. “Yes, Ellie played them an edited version of the night Batman and the Joker died. The identities of you, Sara, and Ellie were hidden, so the villains couldn’t see who you both were. It did put fear in them, but they listened. They followed orders because they realized the consequence of not listening was dealing with a darkness far more disciplined than theirs.”

Tara finished the operational summary. “And Ellie made sure that Harley’s and Deadshot’s families were safe and secure before the mission, so Luthor couldn’t use them as leverage against the Task Force. They had everything to gain by obeying and everything to lose by fighting us.”

A heavy, painful silence fell over the room as the heroes processed the calculated, cold efficiency of their actions.

Clark spoke, his voice low and troubled. “Ellie, the use of fear as a controlling mechanism… that kind of coercion, even for a good outcome, is a dangerous line to cross. It’s what we try to prevent.”

Sara Lance gently put a hand on Clark’s arm, her eyes fixed on Ellie. She was the only hero who truly understood the weight of the video. “Clark, the line was crossed years ago. Ellie just learned how to weaponize the control that Bruce taught her to have.”

Dick stepped forward, looking not at Batgirl, but at his tired little sister barely in her twenties standing before him. “You stopped a world-ending event, and you saved six criminals from execution. But you did it by using the threat of controlled insanity. You embraced the Bat’s edge.”

Ellie met his gaze, touching her pendant again. “It’s the only language they speak, Dick. We used every lesson we were ever taught, the discipline of the Arrow, the fear of the Bat, the control of the Raven, and the precision of the Legend. We brought Luthor back alive, and the Zynothium is contained. Mission status: complete.”

The adults realized the argument was unwinnable. The girls hadn't failed; they had succeeded by taking the necessary, morally grey path the League often avoided.

Kori smiled faintly, pride mixing with profound sadness. “Your grounding still stands, but tonight, you proved your capabilities. Now, you need to sleep. We will discuss the moral cost of this victory in the morning.”

A heavy, painful silence fell over the living room as the League pillars processed the calculated, cold efficiency of the girls’ actions. They had used fear, coercion, and family vulnerability to secure a win.

​Dick finally broke the silence, his face a mask of disappointment and duty. “The moral compromise is immense. We can’t simply ignore that you bypassed protocol, violated the grounding, and utilized criminals as assets. There must be a consequence that reflects the severity of this action.”

​Ellie straightened her spine. The pendant seemed to catch the light. “We understand, Dick. If the consequence of keeping bodies out of the ground is losing our metaphorical hero clearance, then we accept it. We’ll be fine. We’ll just live here as four young women with their grandpa and plan birthdays. We won't complain.”

​Mia nodded grimly alongside her. Rachel and Tara stood firm, ready to face the music. They had made their choice, and they were ready for the cost. But before Dick could pronounce judgment, Sara stepped forward. She placed herself squarely between the League and the girls, and addressed the group, her voice low and firm.

​“Stop,” Sara commanded. “The consequence you’re threatening is the emotional one, not the disciplinary one. And it’s not justified.” She looked directly at Dick, Kori, and Clark. “We established the rule: they were allowed to leave the manor in the event of verified, critical criminal activity. An unsanctioned government black-ops squad being deployed to retrieve a dimension-shifting energy source? That qualifies. They didn't break the letter of the rule; they honored the spirit of why we trained them to step in when the adults fail.”

​Sara’s voice took on a raw edge, speaking directly to her own trauma, her own mistakes. “If you strip them of their work, if you add more layers of rules, if you punish them for succeeding where Task Force X would have failed, they will eventually end up hating all of us. They will either go completely rogue, believing we’re too soft for the job, or they’ll never want to be heroes again.”

​She stepped closer to Dick, her voice dropping to a near whisper, her eyes full of the pain of lost memories.
​""I'm not going to lose my little girl, Dick. Crisis already took that away by locking those memories away, and I don't want Ellie to refuse to speak to me because she thinks I punished her for protecting her team.""

​The heavy truth of her confession settled over the room. Clark, Kara, and Barry, all heroes who had experienced the memory shifts of the Crisis, understood the profound fear Sara carried: the fear that the memory of her motherhood, only recently affirmed by Ellie, could be fractured by disciplinary action.

​Dick looked at Sara, then at the four girls standing defiant but terrified, their hands resting on their connected heart pendants. He saw not four costumed heroes, but four girls whose loyalty was fiercely protective of one another.

​He sighed, his shoulders slumping slightly in resignation. “The grounding… remains. For a full two months. No missions, no patrols, no Batcave access. The only exception is therapy. But the 'hero clearance' is not revoked.”
​He looked specifically at Ellie. “You are the leader of Team Emerald, and you just proved that you understand strategy, control, and compromise better than Waller ever will. Now, go to bed. The League has work to do.”

​As the girls gratefully turned to leave, Kori spoke, her voice laced with warmth. ""We love you. All four of you.""

The tension was broken, but the emotional exhaustion remained. Sara, letting out a breath that was pure relief, stepped out of her role as White Canary and fully into Mom Mode.

​“Alright,” Sara said, looking at the girls with love and concern. “We’ll talk about what ‘controlled insanity’ means later, but right now, you are all on a two-month grounding. Which means,” she sighed, a small smile playing on her lips, “looks like we’ll be having Ellie’s and Mia’s birthday party here at the Manor then.”

​The girls immediately brightened, the thought of a party, even a confined one, easing the strain. ​Soon after, Clark, Kara, and Barry gave Dick and Kori sympathetic nods and flashed away. Dick and Kori spoke quietly with Alfred before taking the stairs to the upper levels, leaving the girls alone.

​Instead of retreating to Ellie’s room, the four girls, still charged with adrenaline, made their way to Bruce’s private study, a room that held more secrets than any computer file.

​“Why are we here?” Mia asked, still touching her pendant.

​“Dad hid the first folder of videos behind a picture frame in here,” Ellie said, running her hand along the back of Bruce’s desk. “He didn't put this kind of stuff on the Bat-servers. He put them in the physical places where we lived our normal lives. There has to be more.”

​Sara found them a few minutes later, standing amid the heavy mahogany furniture. “Hey. What are you girls doing? I thought you were supposed to be resting.”

​“We’re looking to see if Dad hid more tapes,” Ellie replied, still searching.

​Suddenly, Tara let out a soft gasp. She was kneeling by a large, rarely used filing cabinet. “Ellie, I found another folder. It’s labeled ‘Ace’s Adoption.’ There’s a flash drive inside.”

​The five of them didn't hesitate. They ran back up the stairs to Ellie’s room, plugged the flash drive into the laptop, and huddled together as a new title card appeared on the screen, followed by the first clip.

Video #1: Ace’s Adoption (2013, Ellie age: 10)
​The heroes watched the short, perfect clip of 10-year-old Ellie at the pound, choosing a nervous German Shepherd puppy and naming him Ace.

​Sara, watching her younger self, visibly stiffened as she saw the sheer maternal love in her eyes. ""I remember Bruce telling me I looked terrified of commitment that day. But look at my face... I already loved her.""

​Video #2: Wisdom Teeth Confusion (2015, Ellie age: 12)
​A round of laughter broke the tension as the goofy, braces-wearing Ellie declared she felt like she was floating, completely unaware her wisdom teeth were gone. It was pure, unfiltered parental joy on Sara's face as she laughed behind the camera. It was the face of a woman who was simply a mom.

​Video #3: Flirting at Practice (2019, Ellie age: 16)
​The group watched the quick clip of teenage Ellie awkwardly flirting. Sara smiled warmly. ""Look how cute you are trying to flirt.""

​Video #4: Wild 'N' Young (2021, Ellie age: 18)
​Ellie paused the video, her eyes shining with emotion as she looked at Sara. ""This is the last one, Mom. The one I think you need to see."" She hit play.

​The familiar sound of the Supra's engine revving filled the room. Eighteen-year-old Ellie was waiting in the car with a gray-muzzled Ace, the song Wild ‘N’ Young was playing through the stereo, as they were waiting for Sara outside her Gotham apartment. They watched Sara walk up, looking tired but beautiful.

​Sara: ""What are you doing?""

​Ellie: ""We’re going to the dog park.""

​Sara: ""Please drive carefully.""

​Ellie: (Beaming) ""Don't worry, I will. I love you, Mom.""

​Sara: (Smiling back) ""I love you too, Cubbie.""

​The screen dissolved to black.
​The silence that followed was absolute. Sara did not move. She simply stared at the blank screen, tears running freely down her face. She reached out, pulling Ellie into a fierce hug that encompassed Mia and Tara as well.

​“You didn’t just say it casually, El,” Sara choked out, burying her face in Ellie’s shoulder. “You meant it. Right up until the moment Crisis hit, I knew I was your mother. I wasn't just filling a void; I was your mom.”

​“You always were,” Ellie whispered, holding her tight.

Saturday, November 8th, was a joyous, chaotic explosion of celebration in Wayne Manor. It was the joint birthday party for Ellie (turning 23) and Mia (turning 18). The place was packed: the core Titans, Thea, Laurel, Felicity, Kara, Jonathan, and a handful of other young heroes from the JSA blended seamlessly into the crowd. For the girls, the best part was finally ending their two-month grounding and seeing their boyfriends again.
​
​Downstairs in the grand living room, a temporary détente had settled among the senior heroes. Dick, Kara, Kori, Barry, Laurel, Thea, Sara, and Felicity were gathered around the fireplace, discussing the Zynothium cleanup.

​Felicity suddenly paused her conversation, counting heads. “Wait a minute. Where are Ellie, Mia, Gar, and Jonathan? I haven't seen them in over an hour.”

​The others exchanged knowing glances. Sara went wide-eyed in a mixture of mortification and resigned recognition of her daughter’s independence. Thea and Laurel shared a smug, conspiratorial smirk.
​
“Just take a second to think about it, Felicity,” Thea advised, sipping her wine.

​It took a moment longer, but then the realization hit Felicity with the force of a logic bomb. “Oh, god! Oh, my god, they’re………all of them?!”

​Laurel laughed, the sound booming. “They’ve gone a couple of months without seeing them, it’s their birthday party, and they just saved the world from a dimension shift. Just let them have fun, Felicity!”
​
Sara, despite her panic, had an idea that made her smile. She leaned over to Dick. “Dick, I just had another present I want to give. But me, Ellie, and Mia are going to have to leave the Manor.”

​Dick waved a hand dismissively. “Go ahead. I’ll make sure the JSA doesn’t break anything.”

​Sara sighed, giving the group one last exasperated look. “Okay. Now, hopefully, they’re at least under the covers.”
​
​Sara walked quickly up the grand hallway. She tapped gently on the guest room door first.
​“Come in, you can’t see anything,” Mia’s voice called out instantly, muffled by covers.

​Sara poked her head in, seeing the smiling, content faces of Mia and Jon under a heavy blanket. “Hey, Mia. I hate to pry you away from Jon, but get your clothes on. I want to take you and Ellie to get another Birthday present.”

​Mia’s face lit up with immediate curiosity. Sara winked, closed the door, and walked across the hall to 

Ellie’s room, knocking firmly.
​“Hang on!” Ellie’s voice called.
​Sara heard a frantic scramble and then the lock turning. When the door opened, Ellie stood in the doorway, flushed and happy, wearing Gar’s oversized T-shirt along with her pink sweatpants. ​“What’s up, Mom?” Ellie asked, tucking a stray curl behind her ear.

​Mia exited the other room, now fully dressed and smiling. “Aunt Sara wants to take us to get another present.”

​Ellie’s eyes sparkled. “Cool!” She looked back into the room at Gar. “Babe, I’m stealing your shirt.”

​“Okay,” Gar’s relaxed voice responded.

​“We’re taking Mia’s car because it can fit all of us, and I ride in it,” Sara instructed.
​
​Mia and Ellie quickly grabbed their jackets and shoes. They piled into Mia’s Porsche, with Sara taking the driver's seat. She typed directions into the GPS, which calculated a route to a familiar part of the city.
​When the car pulled up to the curb, both girls recognized the building: it was a newly renovated, sprawling animal shelter.

​The girls smiled broadly at each other, happiness making them look like the children in Bruce’s videos again.
​“Really, Mom?” Ellie asked excitedly, jumping out of the car.
​Sara remembered that goofy grin under the anesthesia, the look of wonder when Ellie first met Ace, and chuckled. “Choose whichever puppy you want, sweetheart. Both of you.”

​The two girls ran into the shelter like they were ten years old again. Sara followed, watching them carefully walk through the cages, ignoring the loud barkers and seeking out a quieter, needier friend.

​Ellie found her match in a large, floppy-eared, shy German Shepherd puppy huddled in the back of his cage. She sat down, and the pup immediately licked her face, just as Ace had done years ago.

​Mia found a playful, energetic Husky puppy with brilliant blue eyes that was already pulling at her shoelaces.
​“What are their names?” Sara asked, signing the final adoption papers, her heart full.

​“Duke,” Ellie said, hugging the Shepherd to her chest.

​“And Koda,” Mia announced, scooping up the fluffy Husky.

​The three returned to the Manor, where the party was still in full swing. They were greeted by an immediate chorus of delighted ""Awws!"" as they showed everyone their new family members. The grounding might have been difficult, but the truth remained: they were a family, and that family had just grown by two new, demanding, and utterly loved members.",1,1762221971.0,Arrowverse,0,1.0,False

You can watch the full conversation here if you want the long version: [https://www.youtube.com/@PsycholojistWithDej](https://www.youtube.com/@PsycholojistWithDej)

I wanted to share the main things I learned because a lot of what I was doing was the *opposite* of good sleep hygiene.

# 1. Sleep actually starts in the morning

I always tried to fix sleep at night. She said the brain’s clock is set by *morning* light. Get 10 mins of outdoor light within 2–3 hours of waking (ideally earlier) and your melatonin will rise properly at night. Through a window doesn’t count.

# 2. Consistency beats perfection

You don’t need a 5 a.m. routine, you need a **regular** routine. Go to bed and wake up around the same time, even weekends. That trains the body clock way more than supplements.

# 3. Caffeine timing matters way more than I thought

Caffeine doesn’t give you energy, it just blocks adenosine. Her simple rule: no caffeine \~10 hours before bed, and don’t have your *first* coffee until 90 mins after waking. That way you’re not fighting your own biology.

# 4. Naps aren’t evil, just badly timed

If a nap makes it harder to sleep at night, it’s too long or too late. Early + short = fine. Late + long = you’ve just eaten before dinner.

# 5. Screens really do delay sleep

Bright screens at night tell the brain it’s daytime. She wasn’t anti-phone, she was anti-bright-blue-light-at-11pm. Her suggestion: have a 30-minute wind-down where lights are dim and no phone.

# 6. “I’m tired but I can’t sleep” is often stress

She said bed is the first time most people are quiet all day, so the brain finally dumps everything. If that’s you, do your worrying earlier — journaling, to-do list, whatever — so your brain isn’t trying to do it at 11:30 p.m.

# 7. Lazy days can mess up sleep

If you lie around all day, your sleep pressure doesn’t build. Move, get light, use your brain. Sleep likes active days.

# 8. Kids copy our bad habits

If you want good sleepers in the house, make it a family routine: earlier light, calmer evenings, phones out of bedrooms.



That’s the summary — nothing wild, but when I actually did it for a week my sleep window felt way easier. Although I am still posting this at 1.57am 🥲

**Your turn:**  
What’s the *one* thing that wrecks your sleep the most — screens, stress, inconsistent bedtimes, something else? And has anyone actually fixed their sleep without meds? I’d love to steal what worked for you. 👇

You two, black and red, who allied against me and broke each other card block when i was the main threat, I dont blame you, and I rather envy you because everytime I faced a dominant player, the other player submissed and noob slam my cap while I was trying to fight goliath. 

But you pink, little dirty subhuman, you saw the 2v1 and...you decided to turn it into a 3v1. Yes, thats right, 3 players was full sending every turns on me. 
I guess it says a lot about you as human being not only as a player. 

After i decided to do nothing and become the weak to let you all fight, you were in a dominant position especially after angry noob red slamed one of my cap for you. You were earning +38 by turn and me +7 and nooby red was still mad at me for being the dominant earlier. Red finally suicided on me, and i then killed him with the same disgust we have when we must clean one of our shoe full of dog excrement. 

It was not over. I was waiting for you pink. For the right moment to make you pay the ugliest of humanity you embody.

 I helped black to fight you. And what did you do when you were loosing ? You asked for an alliance with me ! Ho poor boy sad to be taken on 2vs1 ! And what happened next ?

FINALLY I found one and it works great with my Apple Watch. It's called [**TachyMon**](https://www.whipdev.com/tachymon) and is $2.99 monthly and has a free trial. I set it so it alerts me via my watch when my BPM goes below 85 (when I typically feel my brain falling asleep/eyes heavy). Unlike other apps, you can set custom BPM ranges for highs and lows, and choose what BPM causes an alert. The alert is a sound and vibration every 2 seconds while below in the BPM range you set.

I don't drive more than 30 minute commutes, but I get so tired and sometimes it's not easy to pull over. This app has absolutely changed my life and sense of safety. I have use it to more accurately test how much I can raise my BPM by doing things I typically do to stay awake while driving.

Driving will never feel fully safe because for Narcoleptics, it is typically not as safe as people without it. I definitely recommend TachyMon, and getting an Apple Watch just for the heart tracking in general!

If you're curious what helps raise my BPM when it is alerting me, it's moving my arms around like exercising, and doing quick breathing similar to when people are in labor.

For many years now I've felt alone in this marriage.  I'm not sure how to exit.  We own a house together.  We have a home equity loan.  Another loan for home improvements.  If we sold the home and paid off our outstanding loans we'd maybe break even.  So to get out of the marriage world be financially stressful.  I feel very alone in this marriage.  I'm a routine person.  I wake up at 5am.  I feed and walk our dogs.  I make coffee and cook breakfast for us.  She leaves for work at 6:15am.  I leave at 7:00am.  She gets home at 4:30.  I get home at 6pm.  I like to watch TV when I get home.  The news, comedies, documentaries, true crime and sports.  I'm consistent.   Wake up.  Work.  Come home.  Watch TV until 10pm.  Go to bed.  Rinse and repeat.  She is very inconsistent.  She doesn't work on Mondays.  Only Tuesday - Friday.  Leaves at 6:15am and home by 4:30.  I work 5 days per week.  Or the door at 7am and home by 6pm.  I feed and walk the dogs.  I cook dinner.  I make breakfast.  I do the grocery shopping.  I do the laundry.  I do the dishes.  I take the garbage out.  I manage our finances.  I make sure we never miss a payment - ever.  If the joint account is running low, I add money to the account.  We sleep in septate rooms because our Great Dane has taken to sleeping in the bed with her for the last 5 months.  He cries and barks if we try to put him in his crate at bedtime.  We haven't had sex since April.  Only a few times in April.  Before that we hadn't had sex in 13 months.  She has an abnormal relationship with her 39 year old son who lives 1,300 miles away.  They are codependent with each other.  She pays many of his bills even though he had a great job and makes as much money as she does.  One night she'll be asleep on the couch at 6:30pm.  The next night she'll be on the pool lanai texting or talking with her son - literally for 3 or 4 hours.  The next night, asleep on the couch at 7pm.  She and I don't have conversations.  We comment.  Not because I don't want to have conversations.  I think she's incapable.  I try to talk.  I get nothing from her.  Yet she'll have conversations with her mom and son for hours.  Thankfully I have many friends.  I rarely talk about these issues with them though because I feel that no one wants to hear about my problems.  We all have them.  I just feel lost and alone.  I idealize marriage because my parents had a good one.  They were best friends and together for 55 years before she passed away 2 years ago.  I barely consider my wife as an acquaintance at this points.  We're cordial roommates.  And that's sad.  I'm a fun and interesting person.  I'm in sales.  I have a great personality and can talk to anyone about anything.  How is it that I'm in a marriage with someone and we rarely have a conversation?  Sorry.  Just venting.  Feeling alone tonight - like most nights.  She lies.  She belittles me.  She gaslights me.  She is financially irresponsible.  She yells at our dogs all the time because they are just being dogs.

Nothing can be put in an opaque container or stored away, even nearby. That's how we get mouldy leftovers in the fridge. 

The problem with having everything at hand is that things are impossible to find, and it's actually not that handy, and there's so much visual clutter and it's so hard to clean and I'm so over whelmed.

I wanted to save money and offer our clients a better flavored coffee at our hair salon so a win win all around. 

This dinamica is listed as refurbished excellent condition. At $470 with 3 year warranty i figured why not. If it sucks I’ll return it. The first machine arrived and there was a damn screw lodged inside the grinder!! Needless to say the screw wrecked the grinder but I liked the overall machine as it was in good condition. I sent it back and Amazon sent me another one. 

The second one arrived in a bit worse shape but acceptable I think. First thing I did was check the grinder immediately for screws! No loose screws so I turn it on and run the cleaning cycle. First double espresso was set to 3.5 grind and a 5 in strength. The espresso came out and it was not good. Very watered down just overall sucked! 

I crank the grinder up to 7 because the espresso guys always say “grind finer” so I did lol! I set the machine to strength 4 this time and the espresso came out REALLY REALLY good. Far better in smell and overall flavor than my vituro nespresso pods. 

Overall I’m happy with the purchase. I will keep the amazon box just in case it craps out on me and I’ll keep my nespresso machine around for another few months to see what our clients think. 

I used the lavazza super crema beans and they smelled amazing as soon as I opened the bag. Next thing I’m getting is a vacuum sealed plastic container to keep the beans fresh. 

Anyway I think the machine is $399 right now and the 3 year warranty is another $45. At that price I think it’s a great value. ",6,1762220831.0,superautomatic,3,1.0,False

**1) Not sure if guy is interested in me or being hot and cold or am I just assuming things.**

My(20F) crush(25M) offered me his number unprompted twice, and I texted him. He replied, but they were dry and he barely asked any question. I assumed he didn't like me and left it at that.

However, a couple days later, he spotted me in campus(we got to same uni), and came up to me to say hi. I thought maybe I misunderstood him, and invited him for a uni event happening that evening. Although he seemed keen, he missed it, and I was quite disappointed waiting for him. My friends suggested I text him before I leave the event, just to be sure. He did apologise, not too much, but he did seem like he genuinely forgot it but didn't offer to make up for it some other time in his text.

After this was halloween, and I spotted him with 2 women, could be just friends, but I suspect one of them is a situationship. So I decided to really make my intention clear(or atleast try to); and asked him out for coffee on text. I tried my best to show interest( asked him about his weekend, and said I'd lovee to grab coffee sometime this week, how does tuesday / wednesday sound?). He kept me waiting for 22 hours before a reply(my read receipts are off); I assumed it to be a No, although felt bad that he wouldn't say no either. After 22 hours (yesterday), he apologises saying he was busy with a hackathon, hence he couldn't reply. His response was ""Yeah sounds good, I can do tomorrow if it still works for you). Again, I just thought he was being honest about being busy.

2 hours after he replied to me(which was basically 22 hours after I first texted him) I texted him with 2 coffee places asking him to pick one for today. Its been about 5 hours since yesterday night, and next day has begun(which is today when we are meant to go grab coffee in 8-10 hours from now, ideally); and he has not replied.

Again, I am not someone expecting instant replies, but I think anything beyond 3-5 hours for a yes/no text ; or confirming a place seems like he is uninterested (atleast that is me). Idk, if he's a busy 25 year old, whose texting styles are different than someone who is 20? I am afraid he's treating me as a placed holder for the other girl or he is trying to make it difficult for me to go out with him, so I would give up. (I think like this cuz we live kind of in same building, and maybe he is struggling to say no cuz maybe he feels like it may turn things awkward).

The texting gap is really messing with me, idk what to think of this? Do I cancel the coffee saying we don't have to do this if he's too busy, still go ahead with it?

I wanted to share a personal project I’ve been building called **PastePortal**.

Last year (and a bit), I hit a turning point. I lost my job, and as someone who’s neurodiverse with ADHD and autistic traits, I’ve always approached problem-solving a little differently. As a DevOps engineer, I found myself constantly pasting code snippets into Slack or chats, where everything would just get lost in messy threads. It felt like there had to be a better way.

That’s why I built **PastePortal** , a developer-focused tool for sharing code snippets with preserved syntax highlighting, built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**. You can use it through the **web interface**, and I’m currently working on a **VS Code extension**, which should be ready very soon. JetBrains, Vim, and CLI integrations are next on the roadmap.

It’s a little nod to my favourite game, *Portal* , a “portal” for your code, letting you share snippets easily and cleanly without breaking your flow.

Right now it’s **completely free** to use. I just want people to try it and share honest feedback. The costs are minimal for now, but if it grows, I’ll figure out scaling later. If you enjoy it, there’s a *Buy Me a Coffee* link, and soon I’ll add some fun merch like hats, stickers, and T-shirts to support the project.

Security is also a big focus — all pastes are **double-encrypted**. The database is encrypted on the backend, and users can add their own password for an extra layer of protection.

You can check it out here 👉 [https://pasteportal.app](https://pasteportal.app)

Would love to hear your thoughts ,,what would make this more useful for you as a developer? What features would you like to see next?

1onuneo,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1onuneo/dating_challenges_m60/,Dating Challenges (M60),"So I recently started doing online dating again after a three years hiatus (by choice, not because I was in a relationship). The reason why I opted out of online dating was too many bad experiences.

I think I am a pretty good catch, I exercise a lot with cardio and weights. I am 5'10"" 190,  about eight or so pounds heavier than I would like, but I carry a lot of extra muscle compared to most guys my age. I have degrees from elite universities and am financially secure. I'm not asking you to validate my attractiveness, this is just to give you some idea.

One challenge is that 90% of dates are one and done, meaning one in-person date. The usual reason is lack of chemistry. Which reads that they are just not attracted to me. I am attracted to lots of different types of women, and for me that can build over time with the right rapport. These ladies seem to be looking for love at first sight. Or maybe they want a doctor who lives in a mansion and looks like George Clooney. I've heard that most women are competing for the top 10%, and if they can't get that they lament that there are ""no men"".

The second challenge is women who just don't have time to spend with me, and don't respect my time. Women who can't carve out an hour and a half for a coffee date over a weekend because their adult kid got dumped. Women who are only available every other weekend because they have to travel 300 miles to spend time with their adult children twice a month. Or like showing up very late without advance notice and keeping me waiting for an easily avoidable reason (my son called unexpectedly?) Or cancelling multiple dates, or being in a hurry to leave a date after a short time. Everyone gets a flat tire once in a while. But if you are probably going to have to work all weekend, don't agree to Sunday dinner with me. I just think some people live very harried lives and it's always going to be something. A lot of parents with adult children are still helicopter parenting them. Heaven help me if she has a dog, because I will surely be lower on the order of priority than the dog. 

I had one lady put me in the friend zone, but she is still interested in getting together as friends. I asked her about a weekend meeting, and she said let me check with my daughter about whether she can spend time with me instead. Well I know I might not be your first choice, but can you figure out a way to say you need to check your schedule without telling me I'm not your first choice?

Even in the early stages of dating, I expect someone to honor a commitment. I may have an opportunity come up after I agree to a date, but my word is my bond and I'm going to honor that commitment, even on an early date. If someone does not respect your time, that's a good sign they are not into you and are not a suitable dating partner. Or they just have poor character in general.

I wanted to share a personal project I’ve been building called **PastePortal**.

Last year (and a bit), I hit a turning point. I lost my job, and as someone who’s neurodiverse with ADHD and autistic traits, I’ve always approached problem-solving a little differently. As a DevOps engineer, I found myself constantly pasting code snippets into Slack or chats, where everything would just get lost in messy threads. It felt like there had to be a better way.

That’s why I built **PastePortal** , a developer-focused tool for sharing code snippets with preserved syntax highlighting, built with **Next.js** and **Supabase**. You can use it through the **web interface**, and I’m currently working on a **VS Code extension**, which should be ready very soon. JetBrains, Vim, and CLI integrations are next on the roadmap.

It’s a little nod to my favourite game, *Portal* , a “portal” for your code, letting you share snippets easily and cleanly without breaking your flow.

Right now it’s **completely free** to use. I just want people to try it and share honest feedback. The costs are minimal for now, but if it grows, I’ll figure out scaling later. If you enjoy it, there’s a *Buy Me a Coffee* link, and soon I’ll add some fun merch like hats, stickers, and T-shirts to support the project.

Security is also a big focus , all pastes are **double-encrypted**. The database is encrypted on the backend, and users can add their own password for an extra layer of protection.

You can check it out here 👉 [https://pasteportal.app](https://pasteportal.app)

Would love to hear your thoughts ,,what would make this more useful for you as a developer? What features would you like to see next?

The apartment is a third floor walk-up in a recently renovated building on Fulton St, in a prime historic neighborhood of BedStuy. You will be sharing the space with Peter (in his early 40s) and Sara (in her early 30s). Peter has been living here for 3 years, Sara for 5, and the individual you will be taking over for was here for 4 years – meaning, the space is well-loved!



The room overlooks the main scenic thoroughfare of Fulton Street via your own fire escape. Currently it fits a full-size bed, dresser, armoire, bookshelf, and standing desk. The room will be unfurnished when you move in. You will have your own private bathroom, although the bathroom is not ensuite. The other two bedrooms are on the other side of the apartment, so you won't be sharing a wall with anyone else.



Utilities typically run $100-120 a month for internet, gas and electricity depending on the season. We have a washer and dryer in the apartment as well as a fully stocked kitchen with a dishwasher, and hardwood floors throughout. In the common area there’s a cozy couch, rocking chair, coffee table, smart TV, and dining room table, and even a bay window reading nook. We also have a great, responsive landlord who owns the building and the business downstairs.



Finally, for a little more info on us, Peter is an artist and graphic designer and Sara works in public health. As two people of color, we both consider ourselves pretty chill and friendly and are seeking the same in whoever will be joining us to share this safe, non-discriminatory space. Please reach out ASAP so we can schedule a time to meet and show you the place, as historically rooms here have gone quick!



Total wishlist bonus points if you are someone who, like us:

\-Is clean

\-Treats the space as a sanctuary to return to, rather than the place to bring the party back to

\-Doesn’t have a lot of guests over and respects quiet hours at night

Other than that, laissez bon temps roulez! 



A summary of some key points:

\- Landlord requires proof of close to $60k income

\- No broker/agent fee, but you will have to sign on the lease and pay one month's security deposit

\- No pets or couples, sorry!

\- Washer and dryer in unit

\- Fully stocked kitchen with dishwasher

\- Spacious kitchen/living area with lots of sunlight

\- Hardwood floors

\- Well-maintained building with periodic cleaning

\- Private bathroom

\- Utilities include HVAC, electricity, and internet. Usually $100-120 a month depending on the season



Commute via public transportation:

\- 20 mins to downtown Manhattan

\- 40 mins to midtown Manhattan

\- Very close to public transportation - literally on top of the Kingston Throop C train station! B43 bus on the corner. Citi Bike dock half a block away and one block to a Foodtown grocery store and a PureGym.",1,1762219941.0,NYCapartments,0,1.0,False

1onuhas,https://www.reddit.com/r/MotivationByDesign/comments/1onuhas/focus_isnt_a_skill_its_a_neurochemical_game_you/,Focus isn’t a skill — it’s a NEUROCHEMICAL GAME you can actually win,"Everyone keeps flexing their “discipline” and “focus” online like it’s some elite muscle you’re either born with or magically build by brute force. But here’s what most productivity influencers won’t tell you: focus isn’t just about willpower or discipline. It’s actually about managing your brain’s chemistry. The people who seem effortlessly focused? They’re not grinding harder. They’ve just figured out how to tilt the neurochemical odds in their favor.

This post is the breakdown you probably haven’t seen in your TikTok algorithm. No hype. No hustle bro quotes. All researched from the best science-backed sources — like Andrew Huberman’s podcast episodes, Cal Newport’s books, peer-reviewed psychology papers and even neuroscience studies published in Nature and the Journal of Neuroscience. Too much of what we see on Instagram and YouTube Shorts is either oversimplified, misquoted, or just made to go viral. So here’s what really helps.

These ideas helped thousands of people stop blaming themselves for being “lazy” and actually work with their biology. You’re not broken. You’ve just been playing the wrong game.

Here’s what actually moves the needle:

- Dopamine is the start button for focus. It’s not a “reward chemical,” like people say. As Dr. Anna Lembke explains in *Dopamine Nation*, it’s the motivation chemical. It spikes *before* you start working, not after. That’s why starting a task feels impossible when you’ve been swiping TikTok or doomscrolling Reddit. You’re frying your baseline dopamine. Fix: reduce high-dopamine habits (like mindless scrolling) before you try to focus. Use “dopamine fasting” windows — even just 30 minutes of boredom — to reset your baseline.

- Control your environment like a chemist. Attention is environment-sensitive. A 2023 study from the University of California, Irvine showed that it takes an average of 23 minutes to refocus after a distraction. Design your environment to reduce dopamine-draining temptations: phone in another room, tabs closed, open only one window at a time. This isn’t moral discipline. It’s neurochemical hygiene. 

- Use your visual system to trigger alertness. Neuroscientist Andrew Huberman explains that your eyes are extensions of your brain. Focusing your gaze on a single point (called “visual anchoring”) can increase your internal focus. Try this: when you start a task, look at a specific object or spot — a coffee mug, a dot on your screen — for 30 seconds without shifting your gaze. This tells your brain “we’re locking in now.”

- Ultradian rhythms are better than hustle. Your body has 90-minute focus-rest cycles. According to sleep researcher Nathaniel Kleitman, working in 90-minute bursts followed by 15-20 minutes of rest mirrors your natural ultradian rhythm. This method works better than grinding for hours. You’ll feel less drained and can focus longer without willpower battles.

- Novelty hijacks your attention. When something’s new, your brain releases more dopamine to explore it. This is why learning a new app or browsing Reddit feels more exciting than doing unfinished work. But you can hijack that back. Try “novelty sandwiching”: start your work session with something slightly new — a different font, a new playlist, a rewritten headline of your to-do list. Use novelty as a trigger instead of a trap.

- Caffeine only works if your sleep is decent. A 2021 study in *Nature Neuroscience* found that caffeine doesn’t recreate focus in the sleep-deprived. It just makes you feel alert while your brain is still fogged. Caffeine works best when your adenosine system (the fatigue sensor) isn’t overloaded. So honestly, the best focus hack is this: go to bed 90 minutes earlier.

- Avoid context-switching. Every time you switch tasks, your brain has to reload information. This is called “attention residue,” and it dramatically lowers working memory and output. Cal Newport explains in *Deep Work* that batching similar tasks or using time blocks prevents that cognitive tax. It’s not the number of hours you work, but how *fragmented* those hours are.

- Music is chemistry. Silence isn’t always best. A 2020 study from Applied Cognitive Psychology found that lo-fi beats and ambient music improved focus during repetitive tasks. The best combo: instrumental, medium tempo, and no lyrics. Try the “low stimulation” playlists from Endel or Brain.fm. Use music to funnel your emotional state into a working state.

- Low blood sugar = low focus. A drop in glucose can tank your working memory and increase irritability. This is why you can feel “brain dead” at 3 PM. Keep slow-digesting carbs and protein in your system. Not Snickers. Think nuts, Greek yogurt, oatmeal. A small protein-heavy snack can restore mental clarity in under 20 minutes.

- Use “starting rituals” to trick your brain. The hardest part is getting started. So instead of relying on motivation, use a ritual. Same hoodie. Same location. Same drink. When your brain sees the cues, it begins to auto-activate the work mode pattern. James Clear calls this “habit stacking” in *Atomic Habits*. Make the process stupidly easy to begin. Like “open laptop, type one sentence, sip coffee.” Then you’re off.

- Mental fatigue is real, not weakness. A 2022 meta-analysis in *Psychological Bulletin* confirmed that mental exhaustion isn’t just boredom or laziness. After long focus periods, the prefrontal cortex runs low on synaptic resources. That’s why breaks, walks, low-intensity movement, and even naps improve cognitive performance. The brain needs fuel and recovery, just like muscles.

- Don’t just block distractions, *replace* them. Cold-turkey social media detoxes rarely work. Your brain needs a replacement source of stimulation. Try a “boredom menu” — keep a short list of low-stimulation but enjoyable offline activities: reading fiction, sketching, walking. When you feel the urge to scroll, swap it. Rewire your reward system instead of just suppressing it.

- Use boredom as a workout. Chronic overstimulation is wrecking your brain’s tolerance for effort. But you can rebuild it by doing “deliberate boredom training.” One technique from researcher Dr. Gloria Mark’s book *Attention Span*: stare out a window with no phone or distractions for 10 minutes a day. That small resistance increases your baseline focus tolerance over time.

- Your thoughts aren’t always facts. Meta-awareness matters. You don’t need to “clear your mind.” You just need to notice when it wanders and bring it back. That’s focus. Meditation strengthens this loop. A review in *Frontiers in Human Neuroscience* found that just 8 minutes of daily mindfulness practice improves sustained attention and reduces default mode network activity — the part responsible for daydreaming and mental time-travel.

You’re not broken or doomed to be scattered. Focus is not a character trait. It’s a system of brain chemistry, environment, and habits. If you set it up right, focus stops being a battle. It becomes automatic. And the people who seem like they were “born disciplined”? They’re just playing the chemistry game a little smarter.

We worked together for several summers and grew closer over time. While working together, we were both seeing other people (nothing official) but had a flirty friendship that never led anywhere (we kissed once but that was part of a drinking game). I moved away after working together with her but we kept in contact over text/facetime. We both started dating other people but I broke up with my gf last year and she’s still with her bf (dating for 2 years or so). Whenever I’m in town I make an effort to see her for a coffee/lunch and we always have amazing chemistry (not sure how her bf feels about those though). We often have deep conversations over text about our wants and needs in relationships and almost always say the same things. She will also send me videos of herself talking to the camera catching me up on her life and makes me do the same. I’m not the biggest believer in soulmates but I do know she is everything I want in a partner and I think she feels the same. She has also said on several occasions that she would love to move to where I am currently located (not sure if that means anything but I’m overthinking everything at this point). I don’t want to make her current situation awkward or ruin our friendship if she doesn’t feel the same but on the other hand, telling her would get this off my chest and I’d finally have.

Been through a life/death, traumatic year and came out okay. Started to travel the world solo(been to 8 global spots in just over a year, most recently Sweden/Norway about a week ago) as a grounding, therapeutic exercise and took on 4 other tough challenges, instead of pills, going for the bottle, therapy or retreating from life, when it was so easy to go down that rabbit hole. Needless to say, been through hell and back and in a much better position now.

I now live life with intention, purpose, adventure and to form genuine connections, help others. Prefer to connect with someone who is like minded, instead of someone whose into drinking, eating, shopping, watching TV all the time.

I don't drink/smoke apart from the occassional beer or two.   
Open to connecting with someone around my age or a bit younger for a Sat meet up over dim sum( I know a great spot) coffee/tea or a beer maybe and chat. If it turns into a friendship great. If not, then no love lost. At least we can have an engaging experience exchanging ideas. I'm very life/world/streets/people smart due to the stuff I've been through so can impart a lot of life experience to you and if anything, maybe you can share some calm with me.

As im a type of guy who feels great doing something for others.

I am not bragging it but if I am like this then there must be other people like me in the world.

Often when i get lost in the world, i refocus myself by reminding me that I need to help others no matter if its small or big.

But if i want to be happy and keep smiling, I have to make others smile.

But often i forgot to do that on daily basis because everyone is busy right?

So i decided to make an app which can give me a reminder every single day about an act of kindness mission i have to do.

For instance:

Buying a coffee for your colleague or friend
Feeding a stray cat or dog
Watering a dying plant 
And many more

I can just complete that mission to give my self some satisfaction and take some time to smile.

Mooncake: I understand why folks don't want to smell like ""food,"" but I really enjoyed this. It was subtle, but I distinctly got the nuttiness and a sesame note. As it dried down, I also got a powdery honey. For those scared of the salted egg yolk - c'mon. It's good but not THAT hyperrealistic that someone would be like, who's wearing the salted egg yolk. Curious about how folks would layer this? It was Halloween so I ended up trying with all my autumn-y scents (Bee by Ellis Brooklyn, Seven Veils by Byredo, and Sticky Dates and Turmeric Latte by LUSH but I think they all just overpowered it) and called it a day. 

  
Matcha Soft Serve: I don't get any matcha or soft serve. It just smells like...""Perfume""? Kinda reminds me of something - maybe Beyond Romance by Ralph Lauren, which I love but wasn't what I expected. I continue to try matcha scents and be disappointed! 

  
Strawberry Mochi: Smells remarkably similar to Mooncake. I don't get any strawberry but a tea note. Very pleasant, all the answer to what to layer to Mooncake.

**1) Not sure if guy is interested in me or being hot and cold or am I just assuming things.**

My(20F) crush offered me his number unprompted twice, and I texted him. He replied, but they were dry and he barely asked any question. I assumed he didn't like me and left it at that.

However, a couple days later, he spotted me in campus(we got to same uni), and came up to me to say hi. I thought maybe I misunderstood him, and invited him for a uni event happening that evening. Although he seemed keen, he missed it, and I was quite disappointed waiting for him. My friends suggested I text him before I leave the event, just to be sure. He did apologise, not too much, but he did seem like he genuinely forgot it but didn't offer to make up for it some other time in his text.

After this was halloween, and I spotted him with 2 women, could be just friends, but I suspect one of them is a situationship. So I decided to really make my intention clear(or atleast try to); and asked him out for coffee on text. I tried my best to show interest( asked him about his weekend, and said I'd lovee to grab coffee sometime this week, how does tuesday / wednesday sound?). He kept me waiting for 22 hours before a reply(my read receipts are off); I assumed it to be a No, although felt bad that he wouldn't say no either. After 22 hours (yesterday), he apologises saying he was busy with a hackathon, hence he couldn't reply. His response was ""Yeah sounds good, I can do tomorrow if it still works for you). Again, I just thought he was being honest about being busy.

2 hours after he replied to me(which was basically 22 hours after I first texted him) I texted him with 2 coffee places asking him to pick one for today. Its been about 5 hours since yesterday night, and next day has begun(which is today when we are meant to go grab coffee in 8-10 hours from now, ideally); and he has not replied.

Again, I am not someone expecting instant replies, but I think anything beyond 3-5 hours for a yes/no text ; or confirming a place seems like he is uninterested (atleast that is me). Idk, if he's a busy 25 year old, whose texting styles are different than someone who is 20? I am afraid he's treating me as a placed holder for the other girl or he is trying to make it difficult for me to go out with him, so I would give up. (I think like this cuz we live kind of in same building, and maybe he is struggling to say no cuz maybe he feels like it may turn things awkward).

My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt.

1onu68i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Curious-Carry-8494/comments/1onu68i/recyclable_packaging_pouches_pioneering_a_greener/,Recyclable Packaging Pouches: Pioneering a Greener Future for Sustainable Packaging,"In an era where environmental concerns are at the forefront of consumer consciousness, the packaging industry is undergoing a massive transformation. Businesses and consumers alike are seeking innovative ways to reduce waste and minimize ecological footprints. Among the most impactful advancements in recent years is the introduction of **recyclable packaging pouches**. These eco-friendly alternatives to traditional multi-layer plastic packaging have redefined how products are stored, protected, and presented. Combining functionality, durability, and sustainability, recyclable pouches are becoming the preferred choice for brands striving to balance performance with environmental responsibility.

# 1. The Evolution of Recyclable Packaging in Modern Industry

For decades, plastic packaging has dominated global markets due to its cost-effectiveness and convenience. However, the environmental consequences of single-use plastics—ranging from landfill overflow to marine pollution—have prompted an urgent call for change. Governments, consumers, and industries have begun to demand packaging solutions that are both effective and environmentally sustainable. In response, the development of **recyclable packaging pouches** has become a major innovation in the flexible packaging sector.

Traditional plastic pouches often consist of multiple layers of different materials such as polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), aluminum, and nylon. While these layers offer strong protection, they are difficult to separate and recycle. Recyclable pouches solve this problem by using **mono-material structures**, typically made of a single type of plastic like PE or PP, which can be easily reprocessed within existing recycling systems. These materials maintain the flexibility, strength, and product protection consumers expect—while drastically reducing waste.

Today, recyclable packaging pouches are used across a wide range of industries, including food, beverage, cosmetics, pet care, and pharmaceuticals. They are especially popular among eco-conscious brands looking to align their operations with circular economy principles. By shifting to recyclable packaging, companies can not only meet sustainability regulations but also enhance brand loyalty among environmentally aware consumers.

# 2. Features and Benefits of Recyclable Packaging Pouches

Recyclable packaging pouches offer numerous benefits that make them superior to conventional packaging in both functionality and environmental performance. Their primary advantage lies in **material efficiency**. Flexible pouches use significantly less raw material than rigid containers such as glass jars or plastic bottles. This means less energy consumption during production, reduced shipping costs, and lower overall carbon emissions.

Another major benefit is their **lightweight and space-saving design**. Because they are flexible, recyclable pouches require less storage and transportation space, which contributes to more efficient logistics and lower fuel usage. This advantage is particularly valuable for companies shipping products internationally, where cost and sustainability considerations are critical.

Functionality is another key strength of recyclable pouches. They can be customized with a variety of features such as resealable zippers, spouts, tear notches, and transparent windows. These additions improve consumer convenience and product usability. For example, a resealable pouch helps maintain freshness in products like coffee, snacks, or pet treats, while spouted pouches make it easier to pour liquid products like sauces or detergents.

In addition to practicality, recyclable packaging pouches offer excellent **barrier protection**. Advanced film technology allows these pouches to shield products from oxygen, moisture, and light—factors that can compromise quality and shelf life. Manufacturers can choose different film thicknesses and barrier properties depending on the specific product’s needs, ensuring optimal preservation without sacrificing recyclability.

# 3. Sustainability and Environmental Impact

The greatest appeal of recyclable packaging pouches lies in their contribution to sustainability and waste reduction. By using recyclable mono-materials, these pouches are designed to be processed within standard recycling streams, helping to create a **circular economy** where materials are reused instead of discarded. Unlike mixed-material packaging that ends up in landfills, recyclable pouches can be collected, sorted, melted down, and repurposed into new plastic products.

Manufacturers of recyclable pouches are also focusing on **eco-friendly production methods**. Many use water-based inks and solvent-free adhesives to minimize emissions and pollution during the printing and lamination process. In addition, advances in digital printing allow for shorter production runs with less waste, making it easier for brands to produce small batches without excessive material consumption.

From an environmental perspective, switching to recyclable packaging reduces the overall carbon footprint of packaging operations. Studies show that flexible pouches use up to 70–80% less plastic by weight than rigid alternatives. This not only lowers raw material consumption but also reduces transportation emissions. In a time when both consumers and governments are demanding sustainability, these improvements represent a major step forward for responsible packaging.

Moreover, many global initiatives—such as the Ellen MacArthur Foundation’s “New Plastics Economy” project—are encouraging brands to make all packaging recyclable, reusable, or compostable by the end of the decade. By adopting recyclable pouches, companies can proactively comply with future regulations while demonstrating leadership in sustainability.

# 4. Market Growth and Consumer Demand for Recyclable Pouches

The demand for recyclable packaging pouches has surged as consumers become more environmentally aware. Modern shoppers increasingly consider packaging sustainability as a deciding factor when choosing products. A survey by McKinsey & Company revealed that more than 60% of consumers are willing to pay a premium for eco-friendly packaging. This shift in consumer behavior has prompted brands across all industries to rethink their packaging strategies.

Food and beverage companies, in particular, are leading the transition toward recyclable pouches. Products like snacks, coffee, sauces, and frozen foods are commonly packaged in flexible pouches that combine convenience and sustainability. Similarly, personal care and household product manufacturers are turning to recyclable stand-up pouches and refillable formats to reduce plastic waste.

Custom branding options have also contributed to the growing popularity of recyclable pouches. Manufacturers now offer **high-quality digital and rotogravure printing** that allows vibrant, detailed designs without compromising recyclability. This enables brands to showcase their commitment to sustainability while maintaining a strong visual impact on retail shelves.

Furthermore, many retailers and e-commerce platforms are setting sustainability standards that require suppliers to use recyclable or low-impact packaging. This trend is accelerating the adoption of recyclable pouches as both a regulatory and market-driven necessity.

# 5. The Future of Recyclable Packaging Pouches

Looking ahead, the future of recyclable packaging pouches is bright and full of innovation. As material science and recycling infrastructure continue to advance, we can expect even greater efficiency and recyclability. Researchers are developing **next-generation recyclable films** with improved strength, transparency, and heat resistance to accommodate a wider range of products and filling methods.

In addition, the integration of **smart technologies**—such as digital watermarks or QR codes—will make it easier to identify recyclable materials and streamline sorting in recycling facilities. These innovations will help reduce contamination in recycling streams and increase recovery rates.

Sustainability will remain at the heart of packaging development, with many companies aiming for net-zero emissions by adopting recyclable, compostable, or reusable packaging models. As consumers continue to demand eco-friendly options, recyclable pouches will play a central role in building a greener, more responsible future.

In conclusion, **recyclable packaging pouches** represent the next step in the evolution of sustainable packaging. They offer a perfect combination of functionality, efficiency, and environmental care.

    i will have cake available for everyone 

So I’m planning a small wedding that I fear will not be enjoyable for everyone. There will be a max of 40 people and I booked the top floor of a fine dining restaurant with views of the water and the city. It will be a very formal event  taking place in the evening. I have hired a pianist for the night for music. I will have cocktails and a coffee/ tea service with passed appetizers for cocktail hour. Then everyone will get wine with their plated dinner and a dessert. I will have a cake for cutting purposes but it will not be served to everyone. After that we will have our first dance and any traditional family dances but any other dancing is not allowed in the venue. I know people usually attend weddings with the hopes of alcohol and dancing. Alcohol will be limited as this is a very formal event and I do not want anyone getting drunk and making a scene. And then of course there will be no dancing for the guests. Ive been trying to think of alternate forms of entertainment for the evening because I do want people to enjoy themselves but it can’t be anything loud or raucous. Most people will be traveling for our wedding as we live in a different state than most family and friends and I don’t want them to feel like they wasted their time. I’ve seen on here people who will bash weddings with no dancing and I don’t want any of my guests to leave with that feeling of disappointment .

In my last post I asked if I should move to Arlington or Charleston. I had the opportunity to spend some time in both recently and ultimately I decided that DC/NOVA would be a better fit for me. 

With that said, I am trying to narrow which part of NOVA/DC would be best for me. From what I have gathered NOVA and NW DC seem to be the best areas for myself. 

I am in my thirties, male, single. I do not drink, I enjoy being outside, living an active lifestyle, fishing, hiking, going to the gym etc. I also travel a lot around the country for work, and will need to fly regularly. 

I make a high income so not too concerned about COL etc.  

Ultimatley I am looking for somewhere with high walkability, ability to meet new people organically, access to my active/outdoor hobbies, good restaurants/coffee shops, and easy commute to the airport. Of the two is there one that you feel is better then the other for someone in my position? 

In addition if you have any recs for apartments/rental options for either option I would greatly appreciate it. Willing to spend up to $3.5k for rent if it means a great living situation/amenities etc.

A few years ago, I didn’t think I’d ever recover. Sitting in a cramped counseling office, with a cup of lukewarm coffee and a heart full of denial, I finally said the words I’d been avoiding: *“I think I’m addicted.”*  
That single sentence cracked something open—shame, fear, but also possibility.

Counseling didn’t “fix” me.  
It *showed* me layers of humanity I didn’t know I had.  
And when I started diving into research and real-world recovery stories, one truth kept surfacing: **Addiction isn’t a moral failure—it’s a survival strategy gone rogue.**

Here are a few big lessons counseling and behavioral psychology taught me:

💭 **1. The Brain Is a Master Salesperson**  
Addiction hijacks our reward center and rewires how we chase pleasure and avoid pain. Your brain literally becomes a persuasive marketer for self-destruction, whispering that “just one more” is the answer to discomfort. Recognizing that voice—and labeling it—is the first step to taking back control.

💬 **2. Recovery Isn’t About Strength, It’s About Strategy**  
People often say “just use willpower,” but in reality, recovery thrives on structure and connection. Routines, accountability partners, journaling, therapy—all of these create systems that keep you moving forward, even when emotions knock you sideways.

❤️ **3. Shame Can’t Survive Exposure**  
Addiction grows in secrecy. What healed me most wasn’t medication or mantras—it was other humans. Community and empathy dismantle isolation faster than any self-promise ever will.

That’s why I eventually wrote **_Addiction Counseling: A Path to Recovery and Healing_**, to share the deeper tools and frameworks that truly work.  
If you’re walking that same road or helping someone who is, this might genuinely change your perspective:  
👉 [Grab your copy here](https://trendwave-usa.kit.com/3d4461955f)

A few more gems you’ll find inside:

- How to identify “emotional hooks” that trigger relapse  
- Science-backed ways to rewire neural reward pathways  
- Practical scripts for handling difficult cravings and conversations  
- Simple exercises that rebuild self-trust from the ground up  

The more I learned, the more I realized: **recovery isn’t an identity change—it’s a relationship change.** The way you relate to pain, pleasure, yourself, and others redefines everything.

1onu2k2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subnautica_Below_Zero/comments/1onu2k2/twenty_four_hours_below_zero/,Twenty four hours Below Zero,"Twenty four hours Below Zero

Hi All, 

Just wanted to share first impressions and my experiences with below zero. This is probably a tad heavy on the spoilers.

Introduction movie was good. Landing on the ice was a bit startlingly and i didn't waste any time exploring the ice field. Coming across from Subnautica i knew the fabricator is the key to survival. Got to the pod and then checked through the pda. Love the voice acting. Starting an audio msg and going back to gathering certainly set the mood.

First mistake was priorities new toys like the mineral finder over base and garden building. 

Sprialing out from the pod i found a small grove of kelp and eventually a floating science cage. Second mistake. However missed the O2 tank upgrade below it for another ten hours of gameplay. 

With only two basic air tanks and no vehicles found Sam's house and the first blocked relic site. Got some good scans but was kind of creepy exploring the dark lab.

After that back to the pod. A basic base of a couple of cross section and a grow bed for fruit. Disappointed to learn that fruit is different and provides no water, likewise non caffeine coffee is just heat.

Next was Delta Island. On the way spotted the sos on the relic cables and dropped a beacon 100m deep to follow later. Was sunset when reached island. Kept exploring and running back to heat flowers, slowly going upwards. Was full dark and watching a storm hazardous weather warning when that decked out Prawn jump on top of me. What an Entrance! Love the weather effects. Never know if calm or calamity when surfacing. Checked out the buildings and at daylight climbed the radio tower. The greek letter map was probably the best loot.

Still on only two basic tanks and no vehicles decided to follow her east and deep. Built a long room with two glass corner tubes on each side up on the lilypad directly above the crevices to the moonpool. With lots of trail, error, drained air bladders and a couple of bladderfish eventually memorized the path of balloon plants to get from surface to moonpool. 

This was about hour 8. Had two rude bases, pod and lilypad, survival needs taken care of, and several beacons to follow. Died to drowning multiple times trying to scope further from the moonpool.  Sea monkeys are only dangerous if they steal the seaglide. 

Felt like i was playing on unintended hard mode. Built a scanner room on the seabed above the moonpool and started resource gathering with purpose. Fragment hunting located the first shipwreck. Next mistake was wasting over an hour thoroughly searching for the third unit for scanning. Didn't even realise it there were multiple shipwreck parts until ran into the second half going between pod and lilypad bases.

And kappa mining. Couldn't explore much on limited air so just dropped a beacon.

Now about twelve hours in built another scanner room near the lifepod. Was surprised to get the databox tag. Quickly found the high O2 tank. So much easier to explore went your not racing to get out of caves and reliant on airbags to get to the surface.

About 16 hours in finally got around to making vehicles. Used the seatruck to find the remains of Omega base. Shame there wasn't really room in the hollow to build your own outpost there.

Shut down Delta radio tower and now she wants to talk.

Fifth mistake. Used the prawn to explore east past the lilypads looking for the greenhouse. While the prawn was better for surface walking and warmth it was not easy to get it out of the water. Did find the crashed satellite. 

Finally found the greenhouse. Then realised that it is actually easy to spot from the last south east lilypad. Got eaten by angry critter guarding a thermal vent for nothing. Do love the superfood you get from the greenhouse. And that beacons auto deploy on death and respawn. 

Although i do also have a ""dropped beacon"" past map edge after wondering too far from kappa mining.

With the superfood, coffee and prawn ( although missing the grappling rope third fragment) went looking to phi labs. Could have used a snow blind set of sunglasses. So much white, nighttime or the caves were a relief. Explored as much as i could on foot. Glad i kept finding first aid kits those furry heavyweights eat you on the third hit. Only tried the flares after finding the pda hint. 

Sixth mistake. Snox fox. Had the plans for over three hours before i built it. Wasn't keen as described it seemed like you'd just freeze quicker. Threw up a outpost greenhouse of my own next to jellyfish dock and radio tower. Invaluable with respawn and loot storage. 

Should have made robot pengling before exploring phi base and purple tree valley. Would have saved a lot of backtracking and would have found all the magnetite so much sooner.

Twenty two hours in. Decided to check on that broken green flashing signal. Now i got an architect in my head. And have to revisit and rescan several relic sites found eariler.

Twenty four hours in. Finished Sam's mission to inject the enzyme cure.

Hour twenty five . Ice worns are terrifying.

Hour thirty one. Alien robot gravity arms are cool.


Overall the humour is more open. TorxWorks subplot has interesting parallels to RL studio stuff. The vanished scientists have left creepy abandoned buildings everywhere. There feels like more to do and map feels more crowded with the ice shelf not having much below the surface. Weather effects are nice show case for the engine. Never felt in danger dispite the "" seek shelter"" warnings. Plot feels more modern and less like a recreation of something the devs played as kids ( planetfall 1983 ).

While i have had some minor graphic glitches, nothing that needed reloading. Some minor issues with building blueprints looking fine but still being red or green when obviously overlapping plants and other stuff.

At this rate will likely get another 8 - 12 hours out of first blind play, but i think with some fore knowledge could do 100 % playthrough in under twenty four hours easily.",0,1762218726.0,Subnautica_Below_Zero,0,0.5,False

My district told me it was for things such as not arriving early enough, asking for coffee in the lounge, and reaching out to an aid in another classroom for help regarding logging in. 

My district now says they may have to remove me from their system if there are any more complaints and now I'm paranoid as hell😭😭😭 and want to be the best sub possible; especially as someone who hopes to one day teach math full time (I have my credential in SoCal)

1onu1yh,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1onu1yh,Finalizing Monkey Teahouse?,"So I tried to take the advice I received and apply it. It seems everyone thought the teacup was too easily interpreted as a coffee cup, so I changed them all to teapots. I also made a new version with the monkey head as the teapot, which is my current favorite! 

As far as color, I feel like I struggle with that. Originally I chose red because tea has asian origins and I associate Asia with red, but someone suggested that I try green. Green to me does look more tea like. What do you guys think? I also tried one with different shades of green and one with brown and green just to mix it up. Which color set do you like the best? Do you think I could have put the colors in a better spot? Do you think I should try something else all-together?

Back to the actual little logo, I was thinking a lot how it might look from a distance, and I felt like 2 and 4 might be hard to understand from a distance because they don’t have super distinct large shapes. I felt 1 and 3 were more distinctive. Do you agree? 
What about the logo use in other scenarios? I think any might look cute on a cup or on a shirt. 

I also haven’t done too much experimenting with the text since the ones I chose I’m actually quite happy with. I particularly like the rounder one since I think it matches the softness and playful feeling of the logo. But of course I am open to suggestions. 

Once I receive some response, I will make adjustments and choose the final! Thanks so much. ",3,1762218679.0,graphic_design,6,0.8,False

1. Your body can only touch physical objects that are from those two colors and you get a week to prepare yourself.
2. Water does not count, you can still shower or bath in water but the bathtub or shower room has to be of those colors. other liquid like milk, coffee, energy drink etc. however do.
3. Light, visible gas/smoke etc. do not count. Sunlight for example won't count.
4. You cannot alter your perception of the colors via lens or anything else.
5. The objects must be at least 90% of those colors to be considered legit. The 2 colors you pick must be easy to identify and most people can easily tell. For example, a blue fork but with more than 10% of its its body covered in metal will not be considered blue enough. A keyboard that is dark grey will not be considered black etc.
6. Other things like animals include bugs and other people also cannot touch you unless they are of those colors.
