So, the most important question, what‚Äôs the social scene in Toulouse like? I have been living in Germany for last few years and since it‚Äôs a student city, speaking in English with broken German, has seemed to work fine for me to socialise and make friends in university/bars/gym.

I like running, biking and bouldering, so will be up for joining groups which do the same. Also, a certifiable nerd tinkering with DIY electronics, and my computers (building my home server recently), with a strong opinion of what good coffee and AI is. :D I am joining IRIT and will be living nearby, so if these are your interest, hmu.

Unsure what to do and how to not ruin my relationship,"Hi there, I appreciate any support or ideas I can get from here cause I am conflicted and at a loss for what to do. 

So here is the situation. My boyfriend and I have been dating for about a year and a half. Our relationship is solid less some of the typical things you experience in a relationship. Last year we had talked about moving in together, but it was just too abrupt so we decided to give it another year. 

My boyfriend owns his home and his mother lives with him. His mother works full-time remotely and doesn't have any debt because the bf paid it all off. She contribues small bits towards a few things, but not much overall.

Since my bf used to travel a lot for work, he gave his mother the upstairs bedroom/office and his room is in a half finished basement. His mother is not a very clean person and while he is a bit messy, he at least tries to a degree. I usually come stay at his home 2-3 weekends a month and the kitchen is always messy. For example she will bake and leave the counters covered with ingredients, eggshells in the sink under dishes, coffee stains all over, and she will drop pieces of trash all over the floor and it will stay that way for days... It's clear neither her nor the bf rank upkeep as high on the bucketlist, but there is just a level that is a no for me. His mother also has a 2yr old pitbull mix. She is very sweet and I adore her, but she is not trained at all. He has a cat and so do I. His cat is terrified of the dog, so she doesn't leave the basement. It has worked for them, but if I move in, it's going to complicate things for us and the pets.

Here are my thoughts. At 37, I don't want to live in a half finished basement where we would be hanging out, eating, sleeping, and working. So he suggested that we move his mom to the basement and us upstairs. However, this still leaves 2 issues: the dog and our cats, and the cleanliness problem. He suggested we seclude the dog to the lower area, but there will still be a significant risk that she would get to our cats and I am not losing my cat to an incident with the dog.

The house was owned by his parents before they sold it to him, so this is a place they have been for 20+ years. It is very much their house and wouldn't really be mine even if I am living there. Just because I know my personality and habits, I know I will be cleaning all the time and will eventually grow frustrated and resentful over time, and probably say something or step on toes at some point. Another issue is the bf feels responsible for his mother's mental well-being and doesn't think she would do well living on her own. She seems fine to me, but he would probably know better than me.

My compromise would be that either we move her into a house with the dog that we help pay for and if need be, check on her regularly, and if she wanted, find a roommate that could live there as well.

Another idea would be for us to leave her at the house and him and I rent a place for ourselves.

I really don't want to be the girlfriend who says ""it's me or her"" but I don't see any possible way to make it work with the issues at hand. Are there other options I haven't thought of? Am I being unreasonable or worrying too much? I want to do what is right and not just what I want. At the end of the day I want everyone comfortable and happy with the outcome. 

Thanks for taking the time to read and potentially reply.

----
***TL;DR : My boyfriend's mother living with him is preventing us from being able to live together due to cleanliness, our cats safety, and personal space. He worries she won't be ok on her own, but I don't see the concern.

1jcg8mf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AxiomTradingCommunity/comments/1jcg8mf/axiom_pro_the_ultimate_trading_platform_for/,Axiom Pro: The Ultimate Trading Platform for Success,"üëâ [**Level up your trading!** Join **Axiom Pro** today and trade smarter! ](https://www.trimthat.link/u/axiom)üöÄ

What if the secret to crypto trading success is in a tool most traders ignore? When I first used the *axiom pro trading platform*, I was unsure. The crypto world is full of *professional trading platform* promises. But Axiom Pro, backed by Y Combinator, exceeded my expectations. It offers an easy-to-use dashboard and live token tracking, making it more than just a tool‚Äîit's a system for serious traders.

Imagine quickly filtering out coins with a low market cap. Axiom Pro lets you skip coins under $300k, focusing on those with more promise. Its Pulse dashboard shows key metrics clearly, and the hotkey system trades fast, in milliseconds. What really impressed me? The platform's mix of speed and safety. Over 1,000 SOL trades without a security issue? That's reliability that wins over doubters.

# Key Takeaways

* Filters eliminate low-volume, low-cap coins automatically
* Standard fees at 1% undercut competitors‚Äô 1.5‚Äì3% charges
* 6.59% APY on USDC staking beats bank savings accounts
* Hotkey execution matches sniper bots at a fraction of the cost
* Community-driven settings like 0.01 priority and 0.001 bribe optimize speed vs. cost

# My First Encounter with the Axiom Pro Trading Platform

When I first logged into the **Axiom Pro Trading Platform**, it felt like stepping into a crypto crystal ball. I had tried many **top trading tools** before, but Axiom's dashboard was different. The real-time Solana token tracker highlighted hot coins like a neon sign.

Customizable filters allowed me to slice data like a pro chef. No more digging through useless information. But, my first impressions were mixed.

# The Moment I Knew This Wasn‚Äôt Your Average Trading Tool

It was when I compared Axiom's Explore feature to Bullx Neo's tool. With one click, I could see trending tokens with their backgrounds and risks. Other platforms overwhelmed me with numbers, but Axiom made data easy to understand.

This wasn't just another app; it was a game-changer.

# From Skeptic to Convert: My Initial Impressions

I was skeptical at first. Connecting via Google took only 30 seconds. But mastering limit orders took me an hour, with many ""failed trade"" alerts.

Then, I discovered Axiom's DEX-Cex blend. It let me switch between spot and derivatives easily. Even the one-click token sales made me rethink my doubts.

# The Learning Curve: Steeper Than Expected?

Yes, the learning curve was tough. It was like learning to juggle chainsaws. But the tutorials made me laugh-out-loud relatable.

Pro tip: Set priority to 0.01 and enable MEV protection. Your trades will thank you. Now, I'm not a wizard yet, but the benefits are worth it.

# Breaking Down the Interface: Beauty Meets Brains

Imagine a dating profile where ‚Äúgood looks‚Äù and ‚Äúbrainy‚Äù aren‚Äôt mutually exclusive‚ÄîAxiom Pro‚Äôs interface is that rare find. As someone who‚Äôs seen clunky platforms masquerade as *best trading software*, I was stunned by its balance of style and substance. The workspace is like a customizable canvas, not a maze.

Its *professional trading platform* design starts with the dashboard. I could tailor layouts to match my workflow‚Äîthink drag-and-drop charts, pinned crypto ticker widgets for Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Solana, and a ‚ÄúWatchlist‚Äù that syncs with my Bullx Neo wallet. Even tracking rivals‚Äô trades became effortless, with real-time price updates blinking like neon signs during a storm.

Here‚Äôs what clicks:

* Color-coded risk indicators (red = ‚Äúrun,‚Äù green = ‚Äúgo!‚Äù) that turn data into instant decisions
* Side-by-side portfolio comparisons that avoid ‚Äúanalysis paralysis‚Äù
* Customizable alert pop-ups that don‚Äôt drown you in noise

It‚Äôs not just pretty‚Äîit‚Äôs smart. The ‚ÄúMarket Lens‚Äù tool zooms in on trends without burying me in numbers. When I compared it to older tools, Axiom‚Äôs visuals cut through the chaos. No more squinting at tiny graphs or toggling windows. The platform even imports my old trades from other platforms, like it‚Äôs organizing my digital closet.

Most interfaces make you choose between ‚Äúpolished‚Äù or ‚Äúpowerful.‚Äù Axiom Pro? It‚Äôs the full package. And that‚Äôs no compliment‚Äîit‚Äôs a feature.

# The Technical Prowess Behind Axiom Pro

Axiom Pro's sleek design hides a powerful engine. It's built to keep up with fast market changes. It doesn't just follow data; it predicts it. Here's how it works:

*Processing Power:* Imagine a super-fast calculator. It uses Apache Beam and Flink to handle data streams quickly. It can handle Bitcoin's hourly changes or stock market drops without a hitch. It even processes endless data streams faster than my morning coffee gets cold.

*Algorithm Magic:* The algorithms are not just smart; they're clever. They use special tech to find trends in data. On a rainy Tuesday, it caught a small spike in Ethereum that I missed. This let me adjust my stop-loss in time. Its ability to recognize patterns is based on math, and it works.

*Integration Muscle:* The platform works well with others. It connects to HyperLiquid for crypto trades and my favorite bots. It has tools for automatic buying and selling, managing fees, and selling before big changes. Trades are fast, even when fees go up, so they happen in milliseconds.

It's not just technology; it's a tool that turns data into decisions before the market even notices.

# Charts and Analysis Tools That Actually Make Sense

Let‚Äôs talk charts‚Äînot the cluttered spaghetti lines other platforms force you to decode. The *axiom pro trading platform* cuts through the noise with tools that speak clearly to *trading platform for professionals*. My first laugh came seeing how Pulse, its market tracking system, turns raw data into actionable signals without the analyst PhD required elsewhere.

Here‚Äôs what works:

* **Pulse:** Real-time token tracking that highlights trends before they trend.
* **Twitter Smart Contracts:** Scans social sentiment faster than I can scroll my feed.
* **Snipers & Bundles Analysis:** Exposes hidden holder patterns that amateurs miss.

Last month, the Dex Paid Indicator saved my skin. It flagged abnormal whale activity in a token I‚Äôd been eyeing‚Äîso I bailed before the dump. Axiom‚Äôs wallet distribution visuals also made spotting imbalanced supply easier than reading a meme. No more guessing games.

Forget ‚Äúpretty graphs‚Äù that look smart but don‚Äôt act smart. This platform turns data into decisions. When the market‚Äôs screaming chaos, Axiom‚Äôs tools cut through the noise‚Äîno extra caffeine required.

# How the Axiom Pro Trading Platform Transformed My Portfolio

Switching to Axiom Pro was like going from a bicycle to a Formula 1 car. My old way was trial and error. Now, I trade with precision. My annual returns went from 8% to 32% in just 12 months. Here's how it all changed.

# Before and After: The Numbers Don‚Äôt Lie

Before Axiom Pro, my portfolio was all over the place. With its *multi-wallet functionality* and automated buy/sell triggers, I cut losses from 25% to 5% in risky trades. The *hotkey system* also reduced my reaction time by 60%. Now, my charts show steady growth, no more guessing.

# Strategies Only Possible with Axiom Pro

Now, I use strategies I never thought possible before. I automate trades based on real-time sentiment analysis. I also use pattern tools to spot trends early. Here's what Axiom Pro lets me do:

* Trigger trades via predefined crypto wallet activity thresholds
* Customize risk parameters for each asset class
* Backtest strategies using 10+ years of historical data

# The Confidence Boost: Trading Without the Drama

Goodbye, all-nighters stressing over charts. Axiom Pro's *automated sell protections* and real-time alerts turned panic into peace of mind. For the first time, I sleep through market swings. The platform's *emotional benefit*? I'm not just profitable‚ÄîI'm confident. And that's worth every penny.

# Pricing Structure: Is Premium Worth the Premium?

Let‚Äôs talk numbers. When I first saw Axiom Pro‚Äôs pricing, my inner penny-pincher bristled. But here‚Äôs the kicker: paying a bit more for a *professional trading platform* might save you way more in the long run. Competitors charge 1.5-2.5% for limit orders, while Axiom sticks to 1%‚Äîand that drops to 0.7% with referrals. Their automated strategy fees also undercut rivals by 1-2%.

* **Standard fees:** 1% (0.7% with referral) vs. competitors‚Äô 1.5-2%
* **Limit orders:** 1% (0.7% with referral) vs. 1.5-2.5% from others
* **Automated strategies:** 1% (0.7% with referral) vs. 2-3% elsewhere

Volume rebates add another layer. Hit certain trade thresholds, and Axiom slashes fees further‚Äîa perk most *advanced trading platform* rivals don‚Äôt offer. The referral system? Clever. Share a link, earn discounts. It‚Äôs like getting a discount on your coffee just for bringing a friend.

Yes, Axiom‚Äôs base rates start higher. But when your platform‚Äôs algorithms spot opportunities faster than slower competitors, that 0.3% savings elsewhere could cost you thousands in missed gains. I‚Äôve seen portfolios balloon using Axiom‚Äôs tools‚Äîproving sometimes, paying a premium pays off.

Ask yourself: Would you skimp on brakes for a race car? Probably not. The same logic applies here. Crunch the math. If Axiom‚Äôs features boost your returns, those ‚Äúhigher‚Äù fees might just be the best investment you‚Äôll make.

# Battle of the Titans: Comparing Axiom Pro to Other Professional Trading Platforms

When I first tested Axiom Pro, I knew it was a battle for the top spot in trading. It faced off against big names like BullX Neo, [GMGN.io](https://www.trimthat.link/u/gmgn), Nova, and Photon. Each claimed to be the *best trading software* or *top trading tools*. But Axiom Pro stood out with its fresh approach.

# Feature-by-Feature Showdown

Axiom Pro breaks the mold. Here's how it stacks up:

* **HyperLiquid Integration:** Axiom's real-time data sync beats BullX Neo's ""Pump Vision"" mode.
* **Multi-Wallet Flexibility:** GMGN.io's signals are sharp, but their dashboard looks old.
* **Customizable Dashboards:** Nova's design is great for mobile, but Axiom excels on desktop.
* **Speed vs. Reliability:** Photon's old platform is fast, but Axiom's interface is modern.

# Where Axiom Leads the Pack

Axiom Pro leads with its forward-thinking design:

* It offers AI-driven risk analysis, a rare feature in *top trading tools*.
* Its prices are lower than competitors, making it affordable without losing key features.
* HyperLiquid's accuracy beats the competition's delayed feeds.

# Room for Improvement: The Honest Truth

No platform is flawless. Axiom Pro has its challenges:

* It's less known than Photon, a 10-year veteran.
* It lacks advanced tax-reporting features found in GMGN.io's premium plans.
* Mobile sync sometimes has glitches, but Nova's app is smoother.

# Security Features That Let Me Sleep at Night

As someone who‚Äôs moved over 1,000 SOL through the *axiom pro trading platform*, security is my number one concern. The crypto world is like the wild west, but Axiom Pro is like a digital bodyguard. It has a PhD in paranoia.

First, there's non-custodial trading. Unlike some platforms, Axiom Pro doesn't hold your keys. Your funds stay yours, without any third-party vaults to worry about. Plus, *MEV protection* stops sneaky bots from front-running your trades. It's like a racetrack where everyone starts at the same gate.

* Secure wallet connections using industry-standard encryption (so my keys stay locked like Fort Knox).
* Monthly security audits‚Äîbecause even ghosts get background checks here.
* Multi-wallet trading blurs my trail, making my activity harder to sniff out than a ghost in a haunted house.

And let‚Äôs not forget the Y Combinator seal of approval. This name is like a credibility shield. Trust is not optional; it's the rule. Axiom Pro doesn't just meet crypto's wild standards; it rewrites them. It's like having a wolf-sized security suite.

# The Mobile Experience: Trading Freedom or Frustration?

Imagine trying to trade while holding a toddler and a half-empty coffee cup. My axiom pro trading platform‚Äôs mobile app made this situation funny. The interface works well but has some flaws. It makes trading on the go a bit easier.

# App Interface and Functionality

Swiping through charts on a phone is like searching for a needle in a haystack. Important features like algorithmic analysis are tiny. But, placing trades is surprisingly easy.

Compared to apps like Nova, Axiom‚Äôs feels like a desktop on a phone.

# What Works on Desktop but Falls Flat on Mobile

* Advanced chart customization: Tiny screens make it hard to see multi-layered technical indicators.
* Live data streams: Real-time updates are slower than on desktops.
* Custom strategy backtesting: Needs a laptop, not a phone.

# Unexpected Mobile Perks That Deserve Mention

# Real Success Stories: Beyond My Personal Experience

Every winning trade on the *trading platform for professionals* has a story. Axiom Pro is more than my journey. It's where traders make others' strategies their own wins. The *advanced trading platform* lets users see patterns that make winners stand out.

* **Market signals decoded:** When Warren Buffett sold stocks for eight straight quarters, the S&P 500 fell 33%. Today, Axiom users see similar shifts by tracking top traders' exits in real time.
* **Copy the pros:** Hover over any account (anonymized, of course) to see why certain portfolios thrive. One user's habit of cutting losses at 5% saved them $200k during the 2022 crypto crash.
* **Data-driven wins:** The platform‚Äôs analytics show 68% of top traders use its algorithm tools to predict dips. That‚Äôs not luck‚Äîit's strategy refined through communal learning.

The 2023 energy sector surge saw traders following a top performer‚Äôs oil futures plays make 14% in two months. Features like trade history snapshots let newcomers reverse-engineer success without guessing. Even Buffett‚Äôs famed ‚Äú200% Buffett indicator‚Äù warning? Users track it live on Axiom‚Äôs GDP vs. market cap dashboard.

Behind the numbers? A community. When one user‚Äôs ETF rotation strategy went viral on the platform, 300 traders copied it‚Äîand 70% saw gains. That‚Äôs the power of an *advanced trading platform* turning collective wisdom into action. No more flying blind‚Äîjust data, transparency, and the thrill of learning from thousands of live plays.

# Who Should (and Shouldn't) Invest in Axiom Pro?

Not every trader needs a rocket ship to cross the street. Let‚Äôs cut through the noise and pinpoint who truly benefits from Axiom Pro‚Äîand who might be better off elsewhere.

*Ideal users* thrive here if they‚Äôre crypto-focused pros chasing Solana or Ethereum memecoins. The custom scanner creation and multi-chain support turn this into a **professional trading platform** tailored for DeFi warriors. If you‚Äôre automating rules for leveraged trades via HyperLiquid or stress-testing risk models, this is your command center.

* **Who fits:** Traders fluent in blockchain ecosystems
* **Must-have skills:** Advanced chart reading and algorithm familiarity
* **Goal match:** High-frequency crypto arbitrage or portfolio stress-testing

*Not for you?* Skip Axiom Pro if your strategy fits a spreadsheet. This isn‚Äôt a **trading platform for professionals** who trade stocks part-time. Red flags: You panic at the word ‚Äúsmart contract,‚Äù or your portfolio fits on a sticky note. The learning curve here rivals mastering a new language.

*ROI reality check:* Ask yourself: ‚ÄúDo I trade $500k+ monthly in crypto markets?‚Äù If yes, the automation tools save time and reduce human error. If no, the cost (and time) could outweigh gains. The platform‚Äôs value hinges on scale‚Äîthink of it as a Formula 1 engine for your trading rig, not a bicycle pump.

* Check if your *volume-to-tool ratio* justifies the investment
* Weigh the cost against time saved automating rules
* Ask if you‚Äôll use the multi-chain features daily (not just ‚Äúsomeday‚Äù)

Don‚Äôt buy a chainsaw to chop butter. Axiom Pro excels for crypto-focused power users‚Äîbut for casual traders, it‚Äôs overkill. Your wallet (and sanity) will thank you for matching tool to mission.

# Conclusion: Is Axiom Pro Your Trading Game-Changer?

The **axiom pro trading platform** isn't a magic crystal ball. But, its multi-wallet and hotkey system sharpened my strategy. With customizable interfaces and social tracking, it stands out among the **best trading software**.

Yet, even with its speed and algorithm magic, 68% of traders lose money at Saxo Bank. This shows no tool alone can guarantee success. For hands-on traders, Axiom's tools help clear the chaos. But, its steep learning curve might trip beginners.

The forex market's $6 trillion daily volume demands more than just fancy features. It needs to match your trading style. If you want control and deep analytics, Axiom might give you an edge. But, test it first with a small stake.

The right platform isn't magic, but Axiom might make the odds better for you.

Remember, even the **best trading software** can't change your strategy. Axiom's analytics and integration with brokers like CMC Markets are great. But, its value depends on your skill.

If you value customization and speed, Axiom could be your secret weapon. But, if you prefer simplicity, keep looking. Trading is a long journey, not a sprint. Choose a partner that matches your pace.

Start small, track your results, and see if Axiom is worth it. The market doesn't wait for anyone. But, with the right tools, you might just outpace it.

For home practice and rehearsal with the guitarist/ singer not amplified I only need to turn the amp to 1. Strangely enough, I found that in the room we were playing and the guitar / vocals through the PA the exact same setting felt almost felt too loud. I even turned the amp down a minuscule amount because I felt like some of my volume swells were absolutely too loud. The amp was slightly elevated, about 5 feet behind the two of us.

I asked a few people and they said the balance was good and the steel was not too loud. But I am wondering if any more experienced players have any rules of thumb for amp volume when playing in a smaller setting without the amp being mic‚Äôed or any steel going through a sound board for amplification/ monitoring?

# Ethan's Experience with Marketing Mastery

My cousin **Ethan** has always had a thing for side hustles.

Whether it was flipping vintage sneakers, starting a local coffee subscription, or running Facebook ad campaigns for small businesses, he was constantly experimenting.

His one gripe? Some of the beginner-level material felt a bit basic for someone who already had experience with digital advertising.

1jcfr9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1jcfr9p/my_steam_deck_has_been_the_best_thing_to_happen/,My Steam Deck has Been The Best Thing to Happen to me For JRPGs,"Hello everyone.

So I've been a PC gamer for all of my life pretty much. The last console I owned was a PS2 and I moved on to a PC from there for various games that weren't quite JRPGs and started building my library from there. I was saddened when game franchises were on consoles and handhelds I didn't own (Kingdom Hearts was the biggest one that affected me as a kid) but I never got a console for a videogame afterwards. 

When I played on PC back in the day I didn't really play JRPGs. I played Fallout etc but for me sitting at my desk and playing a JRPG wasn't that appealing. There really wasn't a reason why, but I guess I just associated my PC with certain things and JRPGs weren't one of them. I then fell off of gaming for a while.

I was a first adopter for the Steam Deck. I had it for a few games here and there but didn't really become invested into gaming until about half a year ago. Now I pretty much play exclusively on my Steam Deck, to the point if a JRPG isn't supported on Steam Deck it's a deal breaker. I've even started to mess around with trying to put games on GOG on there just recently.  

Playing on it reminds me of being a kid and playing RPGs on the GBA SP, but for grown ups. Playing on the couch or in bed feels so nostalgic and good, and I even take it to coffee shops to play for a little bit after work. Whatever illogical reason my brain had for not wanting to play RPGs on my computer went out the window once I got a PC handheld. Sometimes I'll just enjoy a game better when I'm on my couch versus when I'm at my desk. Don't ask me why, it just does. If I get tired of sitting at a place for too long when I'm playing a game I'll literally just move somewhere else while playing. It's great. I also don't have to worry that much about whether my Steam Deck can handle an RPG that I'm interested in since the genre isn't known for it's taxing on specs (unless it's like FF 16 or anything like that but I haven't gotten around to those games yet). 

I know everyone has their specific preferred environment that they enjoy videogames with and I'm glad I found mine. If I didn't have a Steam Deck and played exclusively in front of my desk I'd probably feel different about certain RPGs. Eventually I want to try installing and playing JRPGs that I didn't quite like on Steam Deck on my PC to see if I enjoy them more and whether my experience changes. Just having that option is so great to me.

It's a great time to be a gamer haha.",9,1742108107.0,JRPG,6,0.68,False
1jcfq70,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1jcfq70/am_i_wasting_my_time/,Am I Wasting My Time?,"I recently starting seeing a girl who I've wanted to date in the past, but never got there. We started talking about 3 months after I got out of a really bad 3 year long relationship with my ex. I wanted to take things nice and slow while talking to this girl, because I felt like my mind was still in that long term relationship mindset and I didn't want to come on too strong too fast (if that makes sense). Out first dates went really well, coffee, a hockey game, dinner. I'm just now getting back from our fourth, which I felt went really well in the way we could easily conversate with each other. Throughout all of these dates, however, I've felt like I haven't really been able to be myself. I'm the kind of person that likes complimenting, not too much but just enough. And little things as well, like how her hair looks, that her outfit looks great, things like that. The strange thing is that I have never met a woman who was almost standoff-ish to compliments like she is. And I don't mean getting shy, I mean full blown telling me not to compliment her at all, and rather being, in her words, ""sassier"". She also told me that she isn't capable of processing emotional conversations either? When anything serious or emotional comes up, she laughs rather than taking it seriously. And this all comes back to my question of if I'm being too long term minded? Or maybe our personalities just aren't matching up correctly?

Lasted 24 hours then I took 25 mg niacin. Which cleared it out. I did this 2 more time. Worked fine.

 The next day I used betaine 275 2 times and I use the niacin 25 mg and felt better. 

The following day/no betaine but I took b12 methylcobalmin 1250mcg and had a mushroom coffee with l methioine in it 35 mg. I had 20 mg niacin in the am. I felt wierd when I woke up in the am like really tired fatigue like. So that's when I took the niacin assuming possibly still overmethylated from the extra betaine.

**Original: Should I Still Gift My Sister the Watch I Bought from My First-Ever Earnings?**

I‚Äôm a 22M from a middle-class family, and I‚Äôm currently gearing up to pursue my Master‚Äôs in the US later this year ‚Äî something I‚Äôll be funding through scholarships and student loans. Recently, I completed an internship with an Indian IT company. The stipend wasn‚Äôt much, but I was proud because it was my first time earning money on my own.

One of the things I was most excited about was buying gifts for my family. It‚Äôs something I‚Äôd always promised myself I‚Äôd do once I started earning. I wanted to make it special, so I carefully budgeted and managed to buy thoughtful gifts for my parents and my sister.

For my sister‚Äôs (20F) birthday, I bought her a beautiful Titan analog watch worth ‚Çπ5000. It‚Äôs not fancy, but I chose it because I felt it suited her style, and more importantly, it symbolized the bond we‚Äôve had over the years. It wasn‚Äôt just a watch to me ‚Äî it was a gesture that carried a lot of heart.

But here‚Äôs where I‚Äôm feeling stuck ‚Äî my older cousin (27M), who‚Äôs an MBA graduate from a top-tier Indian institute and earns a great salary, gifted her an Apple Watch Series 10 (Rose Gold). Naturally, she was over the moon and told him she‚Äôd wear it 24/7. Seeing her so excited made me hesitate.

Now I‚Äôm wondering if I should even give her the watch I bought. I know it‚Äôs nowhere near as flashy or expensive as an Apple Watch, and I can‚Äôt help but feel like my gift might seem‚Ä¶ insignificant in comparison. But at the same time, this wasn‚Äôt just about the watch ‚Äî it was about keeping my promise to her, and sharing something meaningful from my first-ever earnings.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Should I still give it to her? Will it seem underwhelming or thoughtful? I just don‚Äôt want her to feel like my gift doesn‚Äôt matter.

**Comments:**

**Alternative-Talk-795** \-- No, give it to herrr!! My younger brother bought me a cup of coffee with his first pay, and I still remember that day and hold it close to my heart. Don't doubt the beautiful love you have for each other and compare it with materialistic things.

**Kuttapei** \-- Gift it! My younger brother bought me a wall clock (not even a fancy one lol) with his first salary and I still it use it till this day. It‚Äôs the thought that counts.

**Puzzleheaded-Year465** \-- Of course you should, look at it this way. The Titan watch is an analog watch and the Apple watch is a smart one. She will have the best of both worlds and she can wear your watch with traditional or as a dress watch.  
So please go ahead and give, You can say since the cousin brought a smart watch you went with the analog one.

**DildoFappings** \-- When giving a gift, it's the thought that counts. Not the monetary value.  
If I may give my two cents, you shouldn't feel any sort of apprehension when giving the gift to your sister because it's not as flashy or expensive as the apple watch. Watches are an accessory. Apple watches cannot be worn with every attire. Frankly, I find them ugly and I wouldn't buy them even if I was a millionaire. I'd rather accept a cool looking analogue watch.  
If you feel that your sister won't like the watch, then get her something else, something she doesn't have. Or some other accessory like a bracelet or pendant something (I'm just naming stuff because idk what she likes).

**Appropriate\_Bee\_8299** \-- Things aside, where do you get such cousins? And yes gift the watch which you have gotten.

>**OOP** \-- Bro my family is quite close knitted which is generally not in the case of Indian family these days and we share all our problems and resources amongst ourselves. Also that cousin (paternal uncle‚Äôs son) of mine doesn‚Äôt have any sister so he kind of looks for a sister in my sister. I have no problem with that. She is also his sister.

\--------------------------------------------

**Update: I Gifted My Sister the Watch, and I‚Äôm So Glad I Did**

Hey guys,

I just wanted to give you all an update, and honestly‚Ä¶ what a wholesome experience this turned out to be.

After reading your encouraging advice, I decided to go ahead and give my sister the watch I bought for her. In the evening, I finally handed her the gift ‚Äî and you know what? She smiled, got excited, and immediately hugged me.

Later, I told her about the dilemma I had ‚Äî how I was unsure about giving it to her since our cousin had already gifted her an Apple Watch. As soon as I said that, she got in teary eyes, and she hugged me again ‚Äî this time even warmer hug. ü•π

She told me something I‚Äôll never forget: ‚ÄúThe bond we share, the love, and all our memories ‚Äî that‚Äôs what matters most. This watch is special because it‚Äôs from you, and I‚Äôll cherish it forever.‚Äù She said she would wear the titan watch on various occasions as it would suit her style and will tell everyone that her brother gifted her the watch with love. üò≠

Man‚Ä¶ I almost teared up myself.

We ended the evening by watching anime together while devouring some spicy Korean noodles ‚Äî the perfect way to close out such a memorable day.

I‚Äôm so glad I listened to you guys ‚Äî you were 100% right. It was never just about the gift; it was about the love and meaning behind it. I was totally overthinking, and now I have this amazing memory I‚Äôll carry with me forever.

Thank you all so much for the kind words and advice. Y‚Äôall are the best! ‚ù§Ô∏èüò≠

**clumsyandchaotic** \-- ayyy this is sooo wholesome and cuteee. üíóüéÄ

I kept telling them that he can't and that he's not in his body anymore but my father got extremely angry and they left. When my dad exited the house, my brother wasn't behind him anymore and was no where to be seen. The dream ended as I was looking at my father, watching the confused expression on his face fading and fear creeping up. I woke up soon after - I was inconsolable for a good few minutes.

1jcfjum,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1jcfjum/im_genuinely_curious/,I'm genuinely curious,"So to preface, I'm like, 99% out of the church. It's not completely official, haven't removed my records. But my parents don't ask me why I don't go to church anymore and they're aware I drink coffee and don't do the sabbath. They're mostly cool with it, though we do disagree politically here and there. 

Speaking of politics, I'm struggling to find a bright spot in it all. Regardless of whether or not the media is fear mongering or doing it on purpose or whatever, things in the U.S.A. suck right now. And as a young adult (literally turned 21 earlier this month lmao) I just am not seeing the point in trying to pursue or fight for my future. Because with the overwhelming unsavory details and people about, I just can't shake that old TBM thinking that it all means that it's coming to a head.

I'm not sure if predictions are consistent across all members regarding the infamous second coming, but I was always told as a kid that it would basically be like, the end of the world. And I grew up liking pop culture, so you can imagine that I had a pretty good idea what that could look like, even at a young age. The whole ""it's the last days"" spiel was really drilled into my head when I hit upper primary and YW. How all the suffering would happen and if anyone cursed god during that time would be instantly burnt to a crisp or some other such nonsense. I was always told that an increase in natural disasters, wars, crime, obscenities, what have you, meant that the time was drawing ever closer. And as much as I can logically say that the ""last days"" comment has been overused for some time now, it's still one of those things they implanted and I can't shake the dread.

It all seems hopeless to make a long story extremely short. I remember feeling this way when I was battling with doubt, still fighting to stay in it. Because if god can stop my heart whenever he feels like it, if the end is so very nigh at hand, what would be the point of even living? Can anyone else relate?",5,1742107181.0,exmormon,3,0.86,False
1jcfjtk,https://v.redd.it/owmcyc7yyzoe1,[Reposted to include sound] Feeling incredibly blessed to witness nesting so intimately- For a second year in a row. üå∑ü§ç‚ôæÔ∏è,"This time last year, my family was honoured to have a humming bird nest for the first time right outside of our kitchen window.

This was incredibly beautiful, yet emotional for our family to witness, as in June 2023 my mother sadly passed away from stage 4 gastric cancer 6 days after her 62nd birthday.

My (28F) mother loved tending to her garden and enjoyed all the hummingbirds that would visit her in our backyard.

Knowing how special witnessing a hummingbirds nest up close was, I was so touched to learn the spiritual symbolism of these wee darlings:

‚ÄúThe hummingbird symbolism in the bible is connected to death but not in a negative way. The tiny bird is seen as a messenger from the other side, bringing good news from the loved ones who passed. The hummingbird sign from heaven comes to you when you mourn and feel lost.‚Äù

This year, we were fortunate enough to have a return guest. I believe this to be the same mum as last year. She will let me watch her and her babies, and she feels comfortable enough to fly off and leave me alone with her babies as she grabs nectar from the various feeders in the courtyard we‚Äôve placed.

I wish I could upload more photos and videos to this post, because I cannot even believe my eyes with the footage I‚Äôve been able to capture of this new life and unwavering love of this hummer mum.

FYI - I live in the Pacific NW and it is always raining here. To help keep mum and babies protected (we had an intense hailstorm last week), I used a coffee cup lid to provide a small cover/shelter for them during our downpours.

We miss my mum tremendously, so much‚Ä¶ and I still can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs gone from this world. It is hard to find light in the darkest of times, but it is moments like these that I truly believe she is still here with me.

I have always been a lover or nature and animals (I have 6 pets - 3 dogs, 3 cats). The sheer trust that this beautiful mumma hummer has while I‚Äôm near is so special‚Ä¶

Whether she can feel my care and admiration, or if this is in fact a messenger love sent from my mum‚Ä¶ I am eternally grateful. üôèüèΩü§çüí´

1jcfjlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Biohacking/comments/1jcfjlv/aggressive_body_fat_loss_protocol_betaadrenergic/,Aggressive Body Fat Loss Protocol (Beta-Adrenergic Edition),"So i am going to be doing an experiment, I have a lot of experience with PEDs, nootropics, lifting (15 years) and biohacking so you don‚Äôt need to warn me about things. I do know the risks involved with the following protocol but I believe its fairly safe. This is mainly for experimental purposes and i will be doing pre and post bloodwork and keeping detailed notes on as much as i possibly can. 

I am currently around 5‚Äô 9225 lbs, bodyfat % i do not have measurements but i‚Äôd estimate around 24-27%. Im not focusing on strength measurements as much but bench max is 315, squat 405 and deadlift 495 (i have not tried going over these numbers in a while, been more busy with my businesses). But i will do 1rpm to see if i lose a significant amount of strength. Blood pressure always within normal range sometimes slightly high, resting heart rate around 75-85. Bloodwork has been basically perfect every time (i get bloods at least 5-6 times a year). 

I am on TRT currently and pin anywhere from 80-150mg a week generally depending on how i feel (i respond pretty well so this keeps my levels very high, estrogen is always pretty low for some reason though). 

So the fun part, the protocol and changes are listed below.

Main Components: 

- 4mg retatrutide weekly (1 pin weekly) 
- 200mg test weekly (2 pins split) 
- 1000mg metformin daily (with breakfast and with dinner) 
- 80mg telmisartan daily (split am/pm) 
- 30mg adderall xr daily (technically not for the protocol but im ADHD and need this for work) 
- 50mcg T3 (splitting into 2-3 doses) 
- 8mg cialis (pm)
- 50mg Forskolin 
- 5mg yohimbine (pre cardio) 
- 10mg cardarine (pre cardio) 
- 2.5-5mg TREN A daily 

Support:
- 5G Psyllium Husk 
- 400mg Magnesium Glycinate (nightly) 
- 200-400mg L-Theanine (with my morning coffees) 
- 200mg Ubiquinol 
- 500mg TUDCA
- 1200-1800mg NAC 

So this is basically the most powerful and rapid fat loss protocol i could think of (excluding DNP because i will die). I will be conducting the experiment for 8-12 weeks. It focuses mainly on leaning into the powerful beta-adrenergic and nutrient partitioning effects from trenbolone, insulin sensitivity/optimization and appetite suppression from retatrutide, the fat oxidization optimization from cardarine, the stubborn fat targeting from yohimbine and the metabolic increase from T3. 

I believe this essentially targets all fat loss pathways in a semi safe manner with minimal muscle loss. In theory it should aggressively shred body fat. I will u doses slightly on a few things after 4 weeks if i feel things are slowing down. 

Before anyone freaks out i will be doing A LOT of cardio and i lift 5-6 days a week generally, i will not be changing my lifting routine but i will be upping cardio considerably. My diet is dialed in and i will be doing periodic 24-48 hour fasts. If anyone has suggestions regarding cardio, fasting, lifting changes or any other aspect of the protocol please drop them below. I will post periodic updates here. 

I know this is a pretty crazy stack but i‚Äôd like to see the limits of this stuff and get back into shape as quickly as possible as well as advance our knowledge of fat loss being a guinea pig in the process.

Chapter 1

Zorah Maria Esposito lifted her chin, willing the power of the Lord flow over her as she sang her solo during the mass while communion was being served. She was too distracted though and while she could sing this song in her sleep and never miss a note, she felt her heart was in the wrong for not being solely focused on the beautiful lyrics, an ode to Jesus.

Her uncle, her mother‚Äôs brother, Father Ippocrate Giannone was conducting the service and at the moment he was the reason she was nervous. He‚Äôd approached her earlier, a prideful tilt to his head, his robes swishing with his brusque movements and announced he wanted to see her immediately following mass.

The twenty-five other choir members were all wide-eyed as his judgemental eyes stared down at her. All she could offer was a meek ‚Äúyes Father Giannone‚Äù before he swirled back out of the room with a flourish.

Now watching from the back of the church, in the high loft overlooking the church, she noticed his eyes kept flicking to a man sitting in the front row. She couldn‚Äôt see the other man‚Äôs face but knew he wasn‚Äôt someone from their parish, certain she would have recognized the man from his build alone.

As she stepped back to her place in the choir, her best friend Sidonia elbowed her, whispering. ‚ÄúWhat do you think he wants?‚Äù

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know the last six times you asked.‚Äù She exhaled shakily.

‚ÄúDo you think he found out we stayed late Thursday night? I mean we were only praying. We locked up right? We didn‚Äôt forget to lock the chapel when we left?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe locked up, Sidonia. He wouldn‚Äôt be angry we stayed longer to pray.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you confess a sin?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

The choir director turned and shot them warning glances as the communion service drew to a close and they froze.

By the time Zorah hung her robe and assured Sidonia she would meet her back at their apartment, she was decidedly more nervous than previously. Dawdling, offering to tidy the room, she hung back until the last of the choir members left.

Her uncle never was a friendly fellow, despite being a priest. Where some were warm, kind and loving, forgiving transgressions in the name of Jesus, her uncle tended to cast judgements of hell, fire, and brimstone without second thoughts. Her skin more than once felt the whip of his flogger used to punish her for the sins she was undoubtedly committing in her mind.

Since the death of his parents, Ippocrate declared himself the head of the family, which consisted of himself, Zipporah his only sibling, and her daughter Zorah. Zipporah spent more time on her knees praying than Zorah did, and it was saying something. Her mother had been repenting since she‚Äôd found herself pregnant at sixteen from the sweet words of a bad boy. Her parents refused to consider adoption for their only child and insisted all children were blessings and forced Zipporah to raise her baby. Then they died when Zorah was only two and it left the mother and child under the watchful and ever condescending eyes of Father Ippocrate.

She was startled by movement near the door since she was supposed to be alone and looked up in alarm. The man with the broad shoulders who‚Äôd been sitting in the front row of service was in the choir room.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù she nodded nervously. She rarely was near a boy or a man alone. She worked in a dentist office so there were times patients were in the room waiting but this felt different. He was one of the most handsome men she ever saw before. Dark blue eyes, the color of overripe blueberries which would pop on the tongue, bored into her pale brown ones. His hair was thick, black, and glossy, slicked back away from his temples. His shoulders were wide enough she could likely put three of her side to side and there would be room to spare, and he was well over six feet tall and as her eyes perused his frame, trim and fit. Her gaze roving back to his face noted the straight nose and thick lips and she was transfixed as he drew his tongue over the bottom lip which curved into the smallest hint of a smile.

‚ÄúScusi,‚Äù his thick Italian accent rolled off a tongue which offered a growly voice. His eyes mocked as he caught her looking at his body.

She blushed a hot red, ‚Äúcan I help you?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù he asked nodding to the book in her hand.

She swallowed nervously, ‚ÄúI was putting the last of the hymnals away in their proper place. Director Mallorca requested I do so before I go home.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd where is home?‚Äù

The curious edge to his voice gave her pause and she whispered, ‚Äúit is not a far walk from here.‚Äù She took a breath and rushed out, ‚Äúcan I help you, sir? I need to see my uncle as he‚Äôs waiting for me.‚Äù

‚ÄúSir?‚Äù he chuckled, ‚Äúoh sweet Zorah, is this how you would address me?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo we know each other?‚Äù she frowned at him. She couldn‚Äôt place him. If anything, his eyes would be ones to remember, she was sure of it.

‚ÄúNot yet, amor√©.‚Äù

He stepped further into the room, and she knew her eyes were cartoonishly wide as he moved towards her and from the way he moved she almost wondered if the man floated, his eyes focused on her like a hawk eying it‚Äôs prey. She was backed against the shelves of books, her fingers clutched tight around the hymnal in her hand and her breath coming to a full stop. Her eyes closed and she tilted her head away from him as he leaned over her, his nose brushing up the side of her neck as if he were sniffing her, his breath hot in her ear when he whispered.

‚ÄúSo fucking innocent. Almost worth saying a prayer of thanks.‚Äù He stood upright and cupped her chin, ‚ÄúI will see you soon.‚Äù His lips burned her forehead with a kiss.

Without further ado he stood upright and walked back to the door. She was trembling in terror and an awareness of a man she‚Äôd never experienced before. The way he intimately breathed against her neck made goosebumps cover her flesh and she could still feel his lips on her forehead.

‚ÄúZorah,‚Äù he turned at the door, giving her a hard look, this one scary, menacing and she struggled to catch a breath at his frigid countenance, ‚Äúyou best remain untouched until then or there will be hell to pay.‚Äù

With that he disappeared into the church, and she gripped the bookshelf behind her wondering what was happening and why was her heart pounding so hard. Fear was certainly one reason but another emotion, one she never allowed herself to experience before teased her brain. She almost fell to her knees in repentance.

Chapter 2

Standing outside her uncle‚Äôs office in the rectory of the church she folded her hands in front of her waist and prayed he wasn‚Äôt angry with her.

‚ÄúAre you going to stand out there all day, Zorah?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, Father.‚Äù

Her uncle, now in his fifties, had greying at his temples and a deep v of frown lines between his eyebrows. He looked impatiently at her, ‚Äúyou took your time.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt was my turn to tidy the practice room. I apologize.‚Äù

‚ÄúSit.‚Äù

She took the seat opposite his desk and waited with her hands folded primly on her lap. He gave a deep sigh and then finally lifted his eyes to her.

‚ÄúWe all come into this world born of sin.‚Äù

She kept her face neutral as he started what she anticipated was going to be a long, lengthy lecture on whatever mistake she made.

‚ÄúYou are no exception, Zorah.‚Äù His hands steepled on his desk as he regarded her coolly. ‚ÄúYou know your mother was coerced by your father to do the unforgiveable. It was a joke of course. The young man was egged on by his friends to seduce the virgin in their class,‚Äù he inhaled sharply and eyed her with disgust while he regaled her with her origin story, a version she heard more than once in the past. ‚ÄúYou were born because your father was the worst kind of man, preying on the vulnerabilities of a woman who was helpless to do nothing but succumb to the wickedness of her teenage hormones and lust like a whore.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes Father,‚Äù she didn‚Äôt know how to shut him down once he started.

‚ÄúDo you know the name Icaro Lucchesi?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Is he, my father?‚Äù

He gave a bitter laugh, ‚Äúno, though I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the man doesn‚Äôt have a half-dozen illegitimate offspring from his exploits. He is the son of Dagoberto Lucchesi.‚Äù When she still appeared uncertain of what he was asking, ‚Äúdo you know what the mafia is, Zorah?‚Äù

‚ÄúI know there are criminal organizations which are called mafia other than this, no.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are sheltered here in Providence,‚Äù he said bluntly.

‚ÄúI choose to live my life to honor God,‚Äù she looked down at her feet. Since her private all-girls Catholic school when she was five and her church-affiliated college where she earned her degree as a medical receptionist, she continued to practice the teachings.

‚ÄúFat lot of good it‚Äôs going to do you now,‚Äù her uncle muttered.

She considered perhaps she‚Äôd misheard him as he rose and moved to look out the window behind his desk.

‚ÄúI worked hard to be a man of the cloth. I always felt strongly my chastity was of value to the Lord. I know it pleases him. Your mother was weak letting a man have sex with her. However, our parents felt differently.‚Äù

She never heard him speak so bitterly about her grandparents but the way he mentioned them in this moment, she could almost feel the rage rolling off him.

‚ÄúThey felt she was taken advantage of, violated even, despite the fact she parted her legs of her own volition. It didn‚Äôt matter the man seduced her or made promises, she chose to get fucked and then knocked up.‚Äù

The disgusting word spilling from her uncle‚Äôs lips made her gasp.

‚ÄúWhen you were born, your mother tried to get your father to take responsibility. Instead, he further humiliated her and caused such a scene she was ready to commit the most egregious of sins and attempted suicide.‚Äù

She did not know this part of her mother‚Äôs story and felt sick to her stomach, ‚Äúshe tried to kill herself?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. The worm who contributed to your creation told her she should end her life because there was no way he would ever accept a child, and he would spend the rest of his life making sure the entire world knew how much of a slut she was. He threatened to release the video online. He was from a high-profile family here in Rhode Island. My father, realizing how much the release of a video of my sister having orgasms at the hands of her defiler would have been detrimental to his business and to my career as a man of God, took matters into his own hands.‚Äù

She was at a loss. What on earth was she supposed to say? ‚ÄúWhy are you telling me this now?‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause you are now twenty-one. Twenty-two in a few months actually. It is time for you to repay the debt.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe debt?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father went to Don Dagoberto Lucchesi, the boss of the Lucchesi family and asked him for help with their situation.‚Äù He grunted, ‚Äúmy father is roasting in hell right now for paying for a man to be murdered simply because his daughter was a modern-day harlot who could not control her own urges.‚Äù He turned to face her completely now, his hands clasped behind his back as he sneered down at her.

‚ÄúMurder?‚Äù

‚ÄúMy father asked Don Lucchesi to get rid of your father to save our family the embarrassment of the actions of your mother. In exchange for a large sum of cash and a betrothal, the Don accepted the offer.‚Äù

‚ÄúBetrothal?‚Äù this was a word she knew. She sang frequently at weddings in the church, and she often prepared the banners for announcements of marriage.

‚ÄúYes. You were offered as a bride to his eldest son and the second-in-command of the Lucchesi family, Icaro Lucchesi. You have been betrothed to him since you were only days old. Our family was ordered to keep you pure.‚Äù He gave a shake of his head, ‚Äúunfortunately for you, your husband-to-be does not share the values instilled into you since birth. He‚Äôs corrupted in the most villainous of ways.‚Äù

‚ÄúHusband-to-be?‚Äù Her ears were ringing, and she felt very much like she was underwater struggling to surface from the crushing weight on her chest.

‚ÄúYou will marry Icaro Lucchesi in one week from now.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to.‚Äù She wanted to run out of the room but knew her legs would fail her. She sat trembling.

‚ÄúYou have no choice, Zorah. You were part of the deal to murder your father in exchange for the sanctity of our family. If we renege on the deal, then the three of us, you, your mother, and me, will all be dealt with.‚Äù

‚ÄúDealt with.‚Äù

‚ÄúKilled, Zorah. You don‚Äôt mess with a family like this one and we cannot go against them. They are powerful and dangerous and frankly there is nothing I can do to help you now. They have come to collect their debt. You will be married next Saturday morning here in this church.‚Äù He finally gave her a look which bordered sympathetic, ‚Äúand may God have mercy on your soul.‚Äù

Chapter 3

Zorah was grateful for her friend. Sidonia pulled her tablet onto her lap, snuggling next to Zorah under the blanket in Zorah‚Äôs bed offering comfort. When Zorah arrived home two hours ago, dissolving into a fit of tears, her best friend bundled her into bed holding while she cried. Then when Zorah revealed the details of her uncle‚Äôs words, despite his order not to tell anyone, Sidonia was the requisite amounts of furious, aghast, and terrified for her friend.

If anyone knew how sheltered Zorah was, it was her best friend. Sidonia‚Äôs parents were as devout as Zorah‚Äôs mother and uncle. Sidonia‚Äôs mother met her father when she was on a spiritual retreat in a quest to decide if she was meant to be a nun or to devote her life in other ways to God. They ran the bookstore associated with the church., Sidonia‚Äôs aunt was the Sister who ran the school the girls attended. Sidonia‚Äôs grandfather was a deacon in the church and his wife was the church secretary.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to look him up online.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to do this.‚Äù Zorah shivered nervously. ‚ÄúHow can they have bartered me, and my life then kept it a secret all this time?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know but Zorah, we prayed on it.‚Äù Sidonia suddenly made wide eyes, ‚Äúdo you think this is because of Thursday night?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen we stayed late in church to pray to find true love.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo you think God would answer my prayers to find true love by giving me a mobster for a husband?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe he‚Äôs a nice mobster?‚Äù Sidonia asked despite knowing how absurd the question was.

‚ÄúPretty sure there is no such thing.‚Äù Zorah watched with bated breath as her friend pulled up an internet browser and typed in the name of the man, she was supposed to be marrying the following week.

Freezing at the first image which popped up she whispered, ‚Äúoh my goodness.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs the guy who came into the choir room today.‚Äù

‚ÄúThis guy? When?‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter you all left, he stopped in. I‚Äôm supposed to marry him?‚Äù she shivered and pulled her blanket tighter.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs old.‚Äù Sidonia whispered. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs,‚Äù she scrolled through a page which highlighted his statistics as if he were a sports athlete, ‚Äúthirty-five, Zorah. You're engaged to a man who is thirteen years older than you are.‚Äù Sidonia clicked on the images-icon on her browser and the two girls cocked their heads in the same direction as they regarded the number of photos there.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think any of these women are the same ones,‚Äù Zorah whispered. ‚ÄúThey saved my family from embarrassment by marrying me off to a man-whore?‚Äù She tapped her finger on the screen to open a link under one of the photos and they both were wide-eyed at the image under the original one and the byline of the story. It was the man standing with a woman behind him and while parts of the photograph were blurred, what was apparent was they were both naked and Icaro was pointing a weapon.

‚ÄúWhere do you think he had the gun?‚Äù Sidonia asked her lips pressed together as she stared at the photo.

‚ÄúBetween her boobs?‚Äù Zorah offered as she made a gun-shape with her fingers and thumb and tucked them between Sidonia‚Äôs breasts and then pulled them out in a flash and pulled her thumb back like a trigger.

Sidonia howled with laughter at Zorah‚Äôs actions. ‚ÄúNo! Between his butt cheeks?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot in a million years,‚Äù she giggled back. ‚ÄúI watched him walk out of the choir room. His butt was too rounded and tight.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou looked at his butt?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow could I not? He sniffed me Sidonia.‚Äù

‚ÄúShow me?‚Äù Sidonia laughed. ‚ÄúShow me how he did it.‚Äù

She turned Sidonia‚Äôs head and then ran her nose along her best friend‚Äôs neck all the way to her ear and then growled in her ear.

Sidonia fanned herself. ‚ÄúHow did you not pee yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúI almost did.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he really tell you to remain untouched?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. The look on his face was scary as hell. Kind of like this one,‚Äù she pointed back to the photo where he was glowering at whoever it was who took the picture.

Sidonia scrolled through some other photos and clicked on one where Icaro was with three women lounging in a hot tub on a private yacht. ‚ÄúSeriously, Zorah, you should ask him to get an STD test done first. Remember the girl in college who was told she couldn‚Äôt have children because she caught the disease?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. I felt bad for her. She and her husband were trying so hard until she found out he cheated on her and got her infected. She didn‚Äôt know until it was too late. I prayed so hard for her to be cured.‚Äù

‚ÄúMe too.‚Äù Sidonia clasped her hands around her knees.

The two girls started reading article after article about Icaro Lucchesi and each one was more frightening than the last. Multiple women, a few who fought in the streets over him, were associated with his name. Criminals involved in dealing drugs and guns and something called racketeering which they needed to look up to understand were all known associates of the man. He was suspected of multiple murders and ordering hits on people. Many of the things he was accused of doing were allegedly on behalf of his father. One article even went so far as to say he was more lethal than the patriarch to the Lucchesi family.

They were reading a story now dubbed The Affluent Assassin and it spoke about his billions of dollars net worth and whether many of his homes and cars were gains from illegal activities.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs like this guy gets high on thumbing his nose to everything good and decent in the world. I bet if there was a law which said you shouldn‚Äôt punch dogs in the face, he‚Äôd make it a sporting event.‚Äù Sidonia whispered shaking her head incredulously. ‚ÄúHe really doesn‚Äôt care.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt marry this man. His arrogance and hubris are out of this world.‚Äù

Sidonia paused as Zorah also froze at a point in the story, ‚Äúdoes this say his home is in New York and he spends most of his time there?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you going to have to move to New York?‚Äù

Zorah‚Äôs throat felt like it was closing off. This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She shook her head vehemently refusing to believe it to be true, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt want to move, Sidonia. I have a job. I have a life. I have friends. I don‚Äôt want to move away.‚Äù

As another fear was unlocked, Zorah wondered if her day could get any worse.

Chapter 4

Sidonia was gripping Zorah‚Äôs shoulders shaking her frantically, ‚Äúwe live together Zorah. I can‚Äôt afford rent without you. We do this together. I might have to move back in with my parents. Zorah, I don‚Äôt‚Äô want you to move away.‚Äù Sidonia started to cry now.

Zorah threw her arms around her friend hugging her tight, ‚ÄúI love you. I don‚Äôt want to go. I don‚Äôt want to get married.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are we going to do?‚Äù Sidonia wailed into her shoulder.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs look to see if he has a house here in Rhode Island,‚Äù she pushed Sidonia away frantically. ‚ÄúHe has to have a place nearby. I can‚Äôt move away from you.‚Äù

Multiple times they plugged into the browser but there was nothing which linked this man to her home city Providence.

Suddenly her cell phone rang. Zorah noticed the number was not one she was familiar with. A deep sense of foreboding filled her stomach. She stared at it while it rang several times.

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt you going to answer it?‚Äù Sidonia whispered.

She shook her head unable to speak. The phone stopped ringing, and she let out a sigh of relief only to choke on her spit when it rang again.

‚ÄúI think you need to answer it.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat if it‚Äôs him?‚Äù

‚ÄúFind out what he wants.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm scared.‚Äù

‚ÄúJust do it.‚Äù

She answered the phone with a tentative, ‚Äúhello.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo not make me wait again, amor√©. I am not a patient man.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, sir.‚Äù

‚ÄúIcaro.‚Äù He spoke bluntly. ‚ÄúYou are to call me Icaro. Are you excited for Saturday?‚Äù

‚ÄúShould I be?‚Äù she looked at Sidonia who was agape in disbelief, of what, Zorah wasn‚Äôt sure.

‚ÄúYes. Your life is about to change, Zorah.‚Äù

‚ÄúI like my life.‚Äù She pressed her lips to try to stop from crying again. She was a woman who could take twenty strikes of her uncle‚Äôs flogger without a sound now. She was strong.

‚ÄúYou like working in a dentistry office for a dentist who reports your every action to your uncle? Have you ever done anything without his approval in the past?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do lots of things I want.‚Äù

‚ÄúName three.‚Äù

‚ÄúI went to the movies last weekend and he didn‚Äôt approve. Sidonia and I went to the fair a few weeks ago and didn‚Äôt get home until late at night. We drank a bottle of wine with our dinner last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm marrying the patron saint of boredom.‚Äù He grunted. ‚ÄúI know you‚Äôve never fucked but name three boys you‚Äôve kissed.‚Äù At her silence he laughed, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm teasing. I know you‚Äôve never kissed a man.‚Äù

‚ÄúI have too,‚Äù she blurted out, connecting eyes with a shocked Sidonia.

His voice was gruff, ‚Äúwho? Who dared to put their lips on what is mine?‚Äù

‚ÄúI might be a virgin, Icaro,‚Äù she found her voice, ‚Äúbut it doesn‚Äôt mean a man has never shown interest in me or for me to be interested in a man. I have even been on dates.‚Äù

‚ÄúWith whom? I want the names now.‚Äù

‚ÄúWill you be providing me a list of all the women you‚Äôve dated?‚Äù She was strangely feeling powerful as she rendered him speechless, ‚Äúthough based on what I‚Äôve seen on the internet, there may be men in the list as well. Will you be providing me a sexual health panel along with the names of your partners? At least all I would need share is the name of a handful of boys who kissed me if we‚Äôre making comparative notes.‚Äù She looked at the photo again of him naked pointing a weapon. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt have my adventures plastered all over the web for the globe to look at.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou kissed more than one man?‚Äù

‚ÄúMultiple,‚Äù she wasn‚Äôt lying. ‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt lived at home or on college campus for nearly eighteen months Icaro. Simply because my uncle has spies in my employer, my choir director, or the people of our community in the city doesn‚Äôt mean I don‚Äôt still do the things I wish to do.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat kind of dates?‚Äù

The way the words gritted through his teeth made her snicker against the palm of her hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been on dinner dates, to the movies, walks in the park, coffee dates and even once to a place where music was being played where we slow danced. I didn‚Äôt know until today I was betrothed. How was I supposed to know I didn‚Äôt need look for a life partner on my own? Though, I am hoping you don‚Äôt show up on Saturday and this all goes away.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will be there on Saturday, Zorah. I warn you now do not attempt to live an entire life in a week. If you go on one other date I will know, and you will be punished.‚Äù

She clenched her jaw at the threat and her nostrils flared angrily, ‚ÄúI have been punished before.‚Äù

‚ÄúIs that so? I cannot imagine your priest of an uncle, or your saintly mother would be as cruel as I can be.‚Äù

She thought of the times her uncle made her lift her shirt so he could punish her with his flogger leaving raised welts on her skin which sometimes broke open. Her mother never once stopped him despite Zorah enduring the strikes since she was a mere five years old.

‚ÄúIs there a purpose to your call this evening, aside from threatening me to keep my chastity lest I be beaten by a thug who likes to be photographed in various forms of undress with more women than there are in my entire congregation?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are not educated as to who I am yet, amor√©.‚Äù

‚ÄúI am not your love. I do not want to marry you. I do not want any of this. I won‚Äôt be going on dates this week, Icaro because I‚Äôm going to be on my knees praying for God to save me from the devil. I will be fasting, praying, reading my bible day and night for a way to get out of this horrible situation. You are not a good man, Icaro Lucchesi and I deserve a good man. I believe in my heart, it is what God wants for me.‚Äù

His dark chuckle caused goosebumps to rise along her skin. ‚ÄúYou are right about one thing, I am not a good man but what God wants is irrelevant. You are mine and not even if He descended from heaven itself and stood at the altar would He be able to rip what is rightfully mine from my grip.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a beast.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre right. I am. The Beast if you will.‚Äù

Her heart thundered at his words and Zorah considered perhaps she shouldn‚Äôt have been so emboldened by the faceless telephone conversation because his parting words nearly made her faint.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see how much of an animal I am on Saturday night when we begin our honeymoon. If you should pray for anything this week, may I suggest you pray for stamina and endurance. You‚Äôre going to need it.‚Äù",1,1742107082.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

## Key Features to Consider Before Buying

Before you make a purchase, it's meaningful to consider the following factors:

*   **Capacity:** How much water do you typically boil at once? Choose a capacity that meets your needs, whether it's a small kettle for personal use or a large one for a family or office. A commercial white electric kettle should have a higher capacity than the average home kettle.
*   **Material:** Electric kettles are typically made of stainless steel, glass, or plastic. Stainless steel is durable, easy to clean, and doesn't leach any flavors into the water. Glass kettles allow you to see the water boiling,while plastic kettles are frequently enough the most affordable. A stainless steel white electric kettle is ofen seen as the best option for durability and purity for the water. A porcelain white electric kettle or a ceramic white electric kettle are other options to consider.*   **Temperature Control:** If you're a tea enthusiast,look for a kettle with variable temperature settings. Different types of tea require different brewing temperatures.A white electric kettle temperature control allows you to brew each tea perfectly.

1. Seoul - New York City. No explanation needed.


2. Gyeonggi-do - the East coast. Surrounding the biggest city. Still lots of major cities and things to see.


3. Gangwon-do - This area reminds me of the northwest, like Washington and Oregon. Pretty good mix of nature, lots to see and do, very interesting and unique tourist destinations that also have a major coffee culture. People are chill but arrogant at the same time cause they're proud of where they're from and know they get lots of people from other areas as visitors.


4. Chungcheongbuk-do - The good Midwestern states like IL, WI, IN, OH, MN. Clean, nice people, lots of nature to see, the cities are small but chill and manageable. I suppose Daejeon could serve as sort of a Chicago in terms of being a big city that lots of people are interested in. 


4. Chungcheongnam-do - The lesser developed Midwestern states like Missouri, Tennessee, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas. People are fine and the cities are ok but there's a lot of general nothingness and areas that could use tidying up.


5. Gyeongsang Region - I view this area as kind of like the American south. Specifically Texas and Florida in that they are conservative but also contribute a lot to the country and have tons of political influence. Daegu is kind of like an Atlanta in that it's pretty large and wide spread and vehicle dependent. People are very conservative and kind of dicks but it's also ironically a diverse area.


6. Jeolla Region - this is the hardest one so the best I could think of is the Southwestern states like New Mexico, Utah, Arizona. They exist, there's stuff to do and see, but it's kind of cut off from the rest of the country and not easy to access, and they really seem to do their own thing that people outside don't pay much attention to.

A year ago, he‚Äôd stumbled across Slothana, a quirky Solana-based meme coin with a laid-back sloth mascot.

Weeks turned into months, and Slothana‚Äôs whimsical charm caught fire. Viral memes spread, and big investors took notice. One day, the coin had soared, turning he‚Äôs modest stake into $50,000.

1jcfcrq,https://i.redd.it/bt88r0agwzoe1.png,PWD Card Abuser,"Last night, my family went to Tagaytay to have some coffee. We decided to go to SB near Summit Ridge. As expected on a late Saturday evening, people were flocking in the store to have some good sip of coffee while enjoying the good weather. The queu line was long and it took us more or less 25 mins to reach the counter. I noticed someone who went straight to the other counter, seemingly waiting for the couple to finish. Once they're done placing their orders, the girl instantly talked to the barista and shown her PWD ID. Barista then proceeded with getting her order but the thing is this gal wants to place the order of her whole group (there were like 5 of them) and si Ate lang ang PWD. The barista kindly told her that he can get her order and put it in queu pero since di naman PWD yung mga kasama nya, need nilang pumila. 

Note, this happened on a busy night and maraming nakapila. This entitled gal won't leave the counter and is causing delay already as the barista cannot take other orders at ayaw nyang umalis. The barista tried to negotiate and accept 2 cups only but the rest needs to line up. Ate girl won't really accept it and they've been talking there for quite some time already. Ending, the barista took their orders in full, kasama ung mga di PWD and we're obviosly abled teenagers just to take them off the counter and move on with other orders.

In the quiet suburb of Westbrook, crime scenes told stories that most people couldn't read. But Marcus Ellwood understood their language perfectly. As the lead technician for BioClear Restoration Services, he approached each cleanup with methodical precision, restoring spaces where violence had erupted to their former normality.

""Careful with the luminol application,"" Marcus instructed the new hire, his voice calm and measured despite the gruesome bathroom scene before them. ""We need to ensure we've eliminated all biological material.""

The rookie nodded nervously, watching as Marcus meticulously documented each step of their process. Detective Reyes observed from the doorway, her expression grim.

""Seventh homicide this year with similar characteristics,"" she commented. ""The forensics team is baffled‚Äîconflicting DNA evidence, random fibers that lead nowhere, dental impressions that match people with airtight alibis.""

Marcus nodded sympathetically. ""Must be frustrating for your department.""

""Frustrating doesn't begin to cover it,"" Reyes sighed. ""The press is calling it the work of a ghost.""

Marcus had encountered Detective Reyes at numerous crime scenes over the past three years. She was thorough, intelligent, and increasingly troubled by the string of seemingly unconnected deaths that she alone suspected might be related.

Later that evening, Marcus drove across town to his part-time job at Precision Dental Arts. The lab was quiet after hours, allowing him to work undisturbed on dental impressions. His fingers, steady from years of medical training during his time as a combat medic in Afghanistan, carefully manipulated the specialized tools with surgical precision.

His weekend routine at his cousin's taxidermy shop provided further opportunities. While assisting with preserving a twelve-point buck brought in by an enthusiastic hunter, Marcus could collect various materials and study preservation techniques that had applications far beyond mounting trophies.

At home, his basement workshop appeared ordinary to the occasional visitor‚Äîa tidy space where he pursued various hobbies. No one knew about the hidden refrigeration units behind the false wall panel, systematically storing categorized biological materials.

""Each death tells a story,"" his mentor Dr. Weyland had told him during quiet nights in Afghanistan. ""The trick is knowing which details matter and which are just noise.""

Marcus had taken this lesson to heart, but applied it differently than his mentor had intended. He created noise‚Äîdeliberate, calculated static that confused investigation systems designed to find patterns.

His neighbors described him as helpful and quiet. He volunteered at the local animal shelter on Thursdays, expertly handling injured strays with gentle hands. He attended community meetings in his apartment building, offering sensible suggestions about security improvements. He remembered to send his mother birthday cards every year without fail.

Six months after the bathroom scene, Detective Reyes requested Marcus specifically for a cleanup at an upscale downtown apartment.

""This one's different,"" she told him as they stood in the immaculate living room where a body had been discovered. ""No signs of struggle, toxicology suggests natural causes, but something feels wrong.""

Marcus nodded professionally. ""Sometimes the absence of evidence is evidence itself.""

""Exactly,"" Reyes said, studying him with newfound interest. ""You understand investigation better than most cleaners I've worked with.""

""Former combat medic,"" Marcus explained with a modest shrug. ""And I worked at the ME's office before BioClear. You pick things up.""

Reyes seemed to consider this. ""We should talk sometime. Your perspective might be valuable. You see these scenes after we've processed them but before they're erased.""

Marcus agreed politely, maintaining his helpful, slightly detached demeanor while internally recalculating risk factors. Detective Reyes was getting closer, making connections where others saw only coincidence. She would need to be handled carefully.

Over coffee the following week, Marcus listened attentively as Reyes described her theories about the connected cases. She had begun to see the pattern within his deliberately created chaos‚Äîan impressive feat that both concerned and intrigued him.

""The evidence leads nowhere because it's meant to,"" she said, frustration evident in her voice. ""I think we're dealing with someone who understands forensic investigation enough to undermine it.""

Marcus offered thoughtful suggestions, appearing to help while subtly misdirecting. He pointed out alternative explanations for her pattern recognition, suggested procedural blind spots that might be occurring. He became a sounding board for her theories, gaining insight into the investigation while guiding it away from himself.

As their professional relationship developed, Marcus carefully adjusted his methodology. He extended the time between his carefully selected targets, modified his evidence planting techniques based on Reyes' observations, and studied her investigative approaches with the same meticulous attention he brought to his other pursuits.

When Reyes was promoted to lead the department's newly formed serial crime task force, she asked Marcus to consult on crime scene processing protocols. The irony wasn't lost on him as he developed improved standards that other predators might find challenging but that contained subtle weaknesses he could exploit.

""You've revolutionized our approach,"" Reyes told him after six months of declining homicide rates. ""I think we've finally scared him off.""

Marcus smiled modestly. ""Just applying what I've learned from watching professionals like you work.""

That evening, returning to his quiet home, Marcus checked his calendar. It had been fourteen months since his last hunt‚Äîhis longest pause yet. Detective Reyes believed they had won, that their improved methods had deterred the killer she still couldn't identify. The police department was celebrating improved statistics. The newspaper had moved on to other stories.

In his basement workshop, Marcus reviewed his collected materials, his indexed samples, his careful notes. He thought about patience, about the perfect moment, about the satisfaction of a well-executed plan. He thought about the ultimate predator his grandfather had described‚Äîthe one that combines intelligence with instinct.

As Marcus closed the hidden panel concealing his collection and tidied his workspace, he reflected on what Dr. Weyland had taught him years ago. Every death tells a story. But what his mentor hadn't understood was that the most compelling stories were those written by the cleaner‚Äîthe man who arrived after tragedy, methodically restoring order while ensuring no one would ever know who had authored the chaos in the first place.",1,1742105995.0,FictionWriting,0,1.0,False
1jcf9b8,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1jcf9b8/my_story_quitting_alcohol_and_later_caffeine/,My story quitting alcohol and later caffeine,"Hi everyone,

For context before I start, I was an alcoholic for multiple years and quit about a year ago. I've always loved stimulants so I did drink multiple cups of coffee and at least one cup of matcha per day. I've quit caffeine about 2 months ago. I hope my story helps a few ones of you who consider quitting.

  


It's hard for me to believe I would say this one day because I never expected this to be the case: **quitting caffeine has had a BIGGER IMPACT on my well-being and health than quitting alcohol.**



Here's what I noticed: 

  
\- **Much better self-control:** I used to overeat all the time and was constantly visiting the fridge. For years, I thought I must have been insulin resistant or diabetic. Now I can easily fast for most of the days and I don't crave sugars as much as I did when I was still drinking caffeine.

\- **I'm more calm:** It's hard to quantify this, but I just approach every situation of life with much more composure these days. This has made me a better listener AND a better speaker. I'm not constantly thinking about what I'll reply but intently listening to what the person in front of me is saying. 

\- **I used to get angry for a lot of things**: webpage not loading, lineup at the cashier being too long. This would occupy my mind for such a large part of my day. Nowadays, this precious time is spent into deep thoughts. 

\- **LESS ANXIETY - This one is so important that I have to capitalize it.** I cannot believe that this good ""friend"" of mine, the most popular drug in the world, has been the main cause of my anxiety. My days used to be filled with anxiety, often to the point that I couldn't focus for more than a few minutes.

 I have spoken about this to doctors and therapists multiple times: NOT A SINGLE ONE OF THEM HAS SUGGESTED DIMINISHING CAFFEINE CONSUMPTION OR STOPPING IT, NOT ONE. It's crazy how much caffeine gets a pass compared to other substances. Look, I'm not saying that there's only negatives to caffeine consumption but it's incredible how it flies under the radar: consuming high amount of caffeine every day is not normal.

  
In fact, I'm trying to suggest some of my family members who are prone to anxiety and sugar cravings to consider tapering their caffeine consumption but it's such an uphill battle. In recent years, there's been a big push against alcohol and a lot of high-profile people are vocal about their sobriety from alcohol. I really hope the next in line is caffeine.

**Better physique:** I have tried to get abs for years but I have never been able to reach my fitness goals. I can't tell you how many articles I've read that caffeine is such a good pre-workout and that it helps burn a bit of fat.

 I trained hard for years and I never felt like I was getting the results I deserved.  It turns out caffeine is detrimental to your insulin sensitivity which is a significant contributor to muscle building and metabolic health. This is compounded by the fact that I don't have cravings anymore and can stick to my goals.

Also, I usually workout at 5 or 6PM: when I was drinking caffeine this was always the moment of my day where I have a huge crash in energy. I always to kick myself in the butt to go to the gym. Now, these days, I'm fully present for the workout and feel no crash whatsoever before or during training.

I think there is even more benefits but I don't want this post to be too long. ü•î

Now that you've heard my story, I'd love to hear yours. How did quitting caffeine changed your life?

But as I worked the more the red flags with my SM started to appear. Anyways, I'm a very chill and laid back guy, however not a yes man at all and I also don't force conversations with customers when it's obvious they just want their coffee. This is apparently a big no no in my higher ups eyes and I've essentially been dragged along given just tiny scraps of info to put towards my development. Until finally my boss decided to no longer develop me cause ""she doesn't trust me."" All I did was not tattle on my coworkers who were not always following exact standard. And made a mistake regarding mark outs back before I knew all the rules with that. 

Anyways, my heart really left developing when during one of my training shifts. Where she delayed it by 45 minutes because she was talking to a partner about the crappy shift they had, and also doing her PDC (which she was supposed to get done in a two day period but then did most of em in one day and had the remaining few that were left get scattered through the next couple weeks) then about halfway through the training she kicks me out from the back because she was writing corrective actions. Told me it'll be like 4 minutes. I come back a bit later and she's talking with another partner about her corrective action. Get kicked out again and again, spend like 30 minutes just standing around when I should've been training. 

Ig my main question is, is this normal for Starbucks managers? I've worked at a few other stores to help out and only met the managers in passing. But The shifts I talk to make it seem like that while they didn't get the big packet and stuff that I did, they were still given much better footing. 

And also, is it just expected for a ssv to be this type A bold extroverted social person? Because it really seems like they have tunnel vision when it comes to leadership. I've been a lead at other places before. Was even one for 2 years at a Panera. And I have never felt so unprepared and weighted with such high expectations I don't even know about.

# 3. Structure Modification

* Add or remove sections based on your needs
* Rearrange content blocks for better flow

* Remove unused styles and scripts
* Test performance on various devices

# Common Mistakes to Avoid When Using Templates

Not all template customizations go smoothly. Here are some pitfalls to watch out for:

# Overloading With Features

Just because a template offers dozens of components doesn't mean you need to use them all. Focus on what serves your users best and remove unnecessary elements.

# Neglecting Mobile Experience

Always check how your site looks on mobile devices. Even responsive templates might need adjustments for the best mobile experience.

# Keeping Placeholder Content

Nothing screams ""template!"" more than Lorem Ipsum text or stock photos that came with the template. Replace all placeholder content.

# Not Testing Functionality

Forms, buttons, and interactive elements might need reconfiguring to work with your setup. Test everything thoroughly.

# Where to Find More Webflow Templates

Beyond the ones mentioned here, you can discover more templates at:

* **Official Webflow Template Marketplace**: The primary source with over 1,000 options
* **Webflow Community Showcase**: Find free cloneables shared by other users
* **Third-party marketplaces**: Platforms like ThemeForest sometimes feature Webflow templates
* **Individual designer sites**: Many Webflow designers sell templates directly

# Making Money With Webflow Templates

If you're a designer, creating and selling Webflow templates can be lucrative. Some designers make several thousand dollars monthly from template sales.

To become a Webflow template creator:

1. Apply through Webflow's template designer program
2. Create unique, high-quality templates
3. Commit to releasing new templates regularly
4. Build a portfolio of Webflow work to showcase your skills

The perfect template depends entirely on your specific needs. Consider your industry, content type, and functionality requirements before making a decision.
