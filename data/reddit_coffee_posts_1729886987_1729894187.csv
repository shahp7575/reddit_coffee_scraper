[MMRPG: NARRATOR TOOLS 0.5](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VuWEu_-uVLswDaeOlt5On0kdsTuWBHoZ6G7aIEhHm34/edit?usp=sharing)

  
**The long breakdown** (grab a coffee. I am sorry...)**:**

Alright folks, it's been a long time coming and of me chatting it up in here, and it's VERY early days, thus the 0.5 (likely some broken formulas and incorrect data sorry!!!), but lots of you were cheering me on and it felt right to share the early stages of what I call the Narrator Tools, but really it's what will become my Narrator Screen.

What it currently includes:

1. A Name Generator! 

* It can currently generate a random first and last name based on the following filters: gender (male, female, non-binary/gender neutral), species (human, Kree, Asgardian, Skrull), and nationality (28 so far). Couldn't think of anything else, but might eventually add:
   * An alliterative option in honour of the great Stan Lee so Peter Parker, Bruce Banner, that kind of thing, if I can figure out the formula. It's probably decently basic.
   * Funny/serious (really don't know if I'll bother with that ahaha)
   * More nationalities
   * More names for each category for my variation (my native Canada has a shameful few though my fellow French Canadians (Quebecois) have some more if generic names)
   * More species. Would like some demon names, other alien species, dwarves, elves, dragons, etc, anything that is helpful in fantasy, hell, contexts.
   * Might look at implementing by decade and/or century so the names work with a given time period but not sure.
   * Like any Google Sheet random generator, you can't fix the numbers so if you edit something, delete something, change tabs, that name refreshes. So if you like it, copy it and paste it elsewhere. You've been warned!

2. Dice Roller

* This one's more for fun, but I created it for when I feel like doing a quick roll to test things out and don't have my dice around (especially on the go). It's nothing fancy, but could also be used to subtly quickly roll dice for randomization during a campaign without showing your hand. Does remove a bit of the gravitas of inexplicable rolls but you do you! It's there if you need it! Nothing fancy, but you can switch between Initiative (which is really non-combat as well) and any of the Ability Damages.
   * As above, random numbers refresh, so dice roll will only stick if you don't edit anything. There is a helpful checkbox you can click to roll, but delete, typing, changing tabs also does this.
   * It will tell you when you have standard, fantastic, and Ultimate fantastic (initiative only) and gives you the numbered result. Add any abilities etc (might add a field for that)
   * When selecting a damage option, you can edit the multiplier and ability score to that of your player or npc. The calculation should be accurate.
   * There's also a Demonic option for the Initiative rolls. Might explain that homebrew at somepoint but the gist is that something bad/evil happens while still giving the player what they want if that high roll beats the TN. If it doesn't I imagine that would be evil and bad muahahha

3. The Vehicle Profile and Vehicle list (super work in progress)

* should be self explanatory as I shared it somewhere up here and it mostly works as intended: But I have yet to implement a ""click power be brought to explanations"" option, I still only have a few vehicles from the very long list of Marvel vehicles I pulled from online, but at least the skeleton is there for you to have fun with.

4. Data

* This one should be fun for my fellow Data nerds. 
* It's split up by a few categories so far: 
   * **World building** should have all you need for a campaign zero: what genre, what comic book era, what format, which events to get inspired from, what age rating, any locations players want to explore. You grab all that and poof, you have some inspo to get started.
   * **Character Design** is what will eventually populate my Character Creator tab when it's done, but should help you have data for yours if you have one. It includes a long list of Marvel Characters (not all of them but most of them, gotten from online), alignment, species, nationality, Universe numbers (including ours!)
   * **Powers** again super basic at this stage and doesn't have the x-men update, but it's a start.
   * Tags, traits, occupations etc (again pre x-men update)
   * **Game mechanics:** so far just the images and info for the dice roller but I imagine I'll add to this as I create various tools.

Hope you dig! Thanks again to those who encouraged me, this has been a freaking LONG journey, since day 1 I got the book all the way back in May, but it's slowly getting there. The longest part is the character sheet creator. I don't know how much more time it will take me but it's what I'm most excited for as it will effectively permit you to pull any character you want at the click of a name from a dropdown. For copyright reasons, I'll likely only include those generously created here, but all you realistically will have to do is populate a data sheet with the info from the book and it will pull the character out from thin air!

1gc60vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1gc60vc/aitah_for_getting_coffee_with_my_now_soon_to_be_ex/,AITAH for getting coffee with my now soon to be ex?,"I (47M)‚Äòve been feeling pretty bad about this ever since it happened and I need to know if I‚Äôm in the wrong. Our marriage was great up until she (34F) started hanging out more with her boss after work. She works as an importer/exporter at a huge firm in NY so she already has crazy long hours. Recently they have been considering a merger so she says she needs to stay at the office longer and longer. No problem, I can take care of the kids and maintain the house since I WFH about 4 hours a day. I always make sure we have time to meet up for coffee and chat but she eventually canceled those plans and said she needed to focus on the hard work she has to do. 

The problem arose when I noticed she would get more defensive about telling me about the merger and what her role was in the project. She‚Äôs pretty high up so I assume she‚Äôs there with other high ranking members making decisions. Her team is all female except one guy let‚Äôs call him Bratthew. He was a professional soccer player for a few years before hurting his knee and going corporate. From what I hear hes in his 20s and is the most beautiful man (my wife‚Äôs words) in the entire metropolitan area. My spidey senses started tingling so I began to do some investigating. I find him on Facebook after going through my wife‚Äôs secret Facebook that she doesn‚Äôt know I know she has. I send him a message and ask him if we can meet up for coffee and chat. 

He agreed so we met up for coffee and then he did something that first threw me off but then make me angry. He started crying. Like boo damn hoo crying. I‚Äôm starting to get embarrassed because we‚Äôre out in public getting coffee and here he is bubbling as if I‚Äôm breaking up with him. Well turns out someone was getting broken up with and it was him. My wife had called it off because, according to him, she wanted to make a renewed commitment to her marriage. He said she took 3 WEEKS off work to go on a couples therapy retreat with her husband (news to me) to work things out. My wife told me that was an exploratory trip to ‚Äúfact find‚Äù before initiating the merger. I was dumbfounded. After enjoying our coffee and having a pastry he had to go meet up with someone for coffee in a few hours and wanted to go home to collect himself. 

Once I got home and checked on the kids I confronted my wife. I sat down with her and asked her to meet up for coffee so we could talk about a few things. She agreed and we met up. I had so many questions and all I could do was stew in my anger. I was still at the coffee shop from earlier when my wife arrived and I ordered her an herbal tea. She took one look at me and said she had soemthing she needed to tell me. I said me too. We both interrupted each other and then she said, ‚Äúno you first.‚Äù I told her I was as heated as a fresh cup of Joe spilled on a hot summer sidewalk. To my surprise she agreed with me. I told her I knew about her coworker and the ‚Äúfact finding‚Äù trip. She started to cry. I gave her my ring back and told her she had 10 days to move out. She agreed not to fight for the kids or the house (the kids don‚Äôt really have a relationship with her. The youngest says she smells like ‚ÄúRonaldo‚Äôs ballsack‚Äù whenever they get tucked in at the end of the night idk what that means but he‚Äôs 16 and their lingo is above me). 

The next few days were rough and got worse once her mother called me and started berating me. My parents were also somehow on my ex‚Äôs side. They were saying things like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt throw away 20 years of marriage on soemthing so small‚Äù and ‚Äúit was only one time she might not have even liked it‚Äù as if that should give me comfort. All I can think about is how it probably came out and she reached down and put it back in so they could continue. The only ally I had was my sister in law Deckler who pulled me aside to let me know her sister came clean a few years ago. Later that night after the family BBQ she text me and asked me to meet up for coffee and talk. I agreed so we went to my favorite coffee shop and ordered the usual. Deckler told me my gf, let‚Äôs call her Roberta, has been having affairs with all the men in her job. The funny thing is she was sleeping with all the new hires as a way to initiate them in the firm. The other female C Suite members had a sexual act they had to perform to ‚Äúvet‚Äù these guys and my gf was the final boss. I was so livid I couldn‚Äôt finish my second cup of coffee but I did take my muffin to go. I paid the bill, left a tip, and drove home to confront my wife. 

I got home and stormed into the bedroom to ask her to get dressed and meet me for coffee right now. I left and waited at the coffee shop for her to arrive and when she did I told her the lie was over. She said she knows and came clean about everything. And I mean everything. 

Turns out her job doesn‚Äôt exist and she‚Äôs been lying for 13 years. I should‚Äôve known when I couldn‚Äôt find any information about an Im/ex called Vandelay. This whole time she has been making high 6 figures as a comedy writer for 3 shows. She created a pilot and is finalizing a deal with Netflix for a new sitcom. Color me shocked. I had no idea. Now I find myself feeling bad about confronting her at the first coffee meetup. Mine and her friends are saying I‚Äôm the a hole for not understanding why my wife had to be so secretive. But I‚Äôm still having a hard time reconciling with the young hunk from her job. Who did he have sex with? My gf took a dna test and thank god all the kids are still adopted so a sigh of relief there but it‚Äôs gonna take some time to rebuild.

Hello! I, 19M, have a girlfriend, 19F, from other uni. Normal ba sa isang prof-student relationship ang mga ito? We have argued about this particular prof of her ample times already. Eh kasi naman, ang weird talaga. She sometimes says na she is her prof's fav disney princess. Her classmates even once joked about her having a crush on that prof in a facbook post. It didn't sit well with me kaya I opened it up and we argued about it ample times. There were a lot of things na nangyari din and we even broke up (or cool off kasi we still had access sa isa't isang account). After a while, we reconciled naman kasi I thought of giving her another chance. Her prof was apparently aware of that break up. 

Nung nagkabalikan na kami, it got worse. At first, naweirduhan ako sa gestures ni prof kasi my gf asked that prof to teach her one-on-one - prof said yes, didn't even think twice, and nilibre pa siya ng coffee 2x kahit siya na naabala. I get it, siya may work kaya normal lang 'yun but things got weirder thereon. Sometimes, mas mahaba pa chats nila kaysa sa amin and nakakapagtanong siya ng silly questions sa prof, e ako, hindi man lang matanong if I was doing okay kahit na I was going through something, everybody notices, and ang cold ko sa kaniya (sakit). Then, the prof started saying good morning and good night, asked about personal stuff (what she was doing etc etc), and once even asked her if she had her lunch na ba, ALL IN THE CONTEXT NA WE WERE TOGETHER AGAIN ALREADY YET SHE WAS STILL ENTERTAINING THESE. We went to a coffee shop to study. We argued about it na naman and we made a bet. If iaask niya raw 'yung prof niya if kayang dayuhin siyang magkape here sa kyusi (the prof is from manila), would her prof say yes? I betted yes, she betted no. Her prof answered na yes probably, depende if alam niya kung paano puntahan siya. I was like wtf??? At this point, convinced na rin siyang may gusto nga sa kaniya.

Ito 'yung mas kinaiinisan ko pa. That time nga na we were in a coffee shop, mag-uupdate na sana siya sa prof niya na nagkakape siya. Pinicture-an niya 'yung coffee niya mag-isa. Ang tanong, bakit mag-isa e andoon naman ako? So I insisted na isama niya 'yung cup ko. Pumayag naman siya pero mukhang pilit (lol). I also insisted na sabihin niya sa prof niya na kasama niya bf niya. Girl, ayaw niya pa sana sabihin kung hindi ko pinilit. Then she sent those stuff na. Nagdamdam ako noon pero I did not let it show na lang. Nagulat ako nung niregard ako ng prof niya as ex. Ex daw ba niya 'yung kasama niya (sinabi niya 'to before niya mabasang sinabi ng gf ko na kasama niya ako). Wtf. Kaya pala super naaattach siya sa gf ko kasi she thought na wala na kami? Mukhang ayaw rin ipaalam ng gf ko kasi very reluctant pa siyang isend na kasama niya ako??? After that, hindi siya nag-good night. Sabi niya sa gf ko mag-ingat daw siya pauwi and may maghahatid naman daw sa kaniya, sabay sabi pang ""whoever that person is"". Tinawanan lang siya ng gf ko :)). Nanlumo ako HAHAHAHA. She did not even bother explaining to her prof na ayos na kami. Tinawanan niya pa 'yung remarks na 'yung ng prof.

Now, we finally argued ulit. Honestly, gusto kong layuan niya prof niya pero alam kong hindi niya 'yun magagawa since org adviser siya at prof sa 3 courses. Alam kong she'd rather have our rs ended if pinagpatuloy kong ibring up 'yon. Wala akong laban. Sabi niya, she'd set boundaries na raw from there. Inask pa sa akin ng gf ko if okay lang bang magpaturo pa rin sa prof niya kahit in big groups na lang. Pumayag ako kahit masakit, as long as she set her boundaries. I told her na nasaktan ako pero sabi niya hindi niya raw talaga kayang iwasan si prof bc of her acads nga. I don't know what to do anymore, guys. Should I keep fighting or super nagpapakatanga na ako?

Search terms:
Tith*
Temple*

Info: Each point is the total word count found for each result aggregated by decade. It does NOT refer to a talk count. For example, if one talk mentions tithing 5 times, it gets counted 5 times.

If a talk mentions tithing and temples in the same sentences both are counted.

If the talk mentions a ""tithe-payer"" that counts.

If the talk says ""go to the temple"" it counts.

If it says ""she had a temple recomend"" that counts.

It is counted regardless of the overall topic. If it is a talk about coffee and said, ""because of coffee they couldn't go to the temple"" that counts as a reference to the temple.

I'm not the type who drinks coffee honestly; I'm a tea person, but today I thought to myself, Let's drink an iced latte, so I went to buy one. 

While I'm done ordering and I have to pay, but my credit card has another saying in this. Every time I want to pay, it is declined, which is embarrassing enough. 
The worker asked me if I have cash, so the best answer I could've thought of was to say, ""I swear I have money; I can show you my bank account.""
All of a sudden I hear the guy behind me blasting in laughter, and he told me, ""You seem really lovely; you have a bright energy, so let me ask you for a coffee with me today."" 

I'm really thankful for his gesture because I would have thought about this day as the most embarrassing day of my life, but because of him, I had one of the best conversations of my life. ",4,1729893036.0,CasualConversation,0,1.0,False

We are putting out a desperate plea for someone with any level of valid first aid to volunteer at a fundraiser we are hosting at UVic on Nov 4th from 11:30-5:30. We will be allowing students to smash pumpkins with a sledgehammer (it was going to be a sword but UVic didn't like the idea of us handing students a pointy and sharp sword). If we cannot find someone with valid first aid, UVic will not let us have this fundraiser that will go towards our Student Led Conference in the spring.

Basically, your job will be to sit around and watch a bunch of students and staff take out the stress of the semester on poor unsuspecting jack-o-lanterns and pumpkins, and if someone bonks themselves hard enough to warrant first aid you will be in charge of rendering your services. We can ply you with coffee, tea, pop, etc. If you need volunteer hours we will sign off on those. If you want us to cover parking I will personally pay for your parking. If you also want to smash a few pumpkins, we would be happy to give you the chance.

If you are interested in saving our butts and being the reason this fundraiser happens, please either DM us your contact information or send an email to [mscu.1381@gmail.com](mailto:mscu.1381@gmail.com)",3,1729892926.0,VictoriaBC,6,0.8,False
1gc5os4,https://www.reddit.com/r/RWBYOC/comments/1gc5os4/story_draft_team_flor/,Story Draft: Team FLOR,"In the skies over Vale, a young man zipped through the air, flames blasting from his feet. His white hair whipped in the wind, and matching white hoodie fluttered behind him as he bobbed his head to music in his headphones, drowning out the roar of his makeshift propulsion. He wasn‚Äôt alone‚Äîfar from it.

On his back, another young man with azure hair was perched, yawning and rubbing his eyes. He struggled to stay awake but managed a soft, contented smile. Clinging to either of the airborne young man‚Äôs arms were two faunus: a green-haired fox with a mischievous grin, and a wolf with yellow-highlighted black hair who wore an expression of annoyance.

Wolf Faunus: ‚ÄúLegolas, remind me again how we ended up a week late for Beacon's initiation test?‚Äù

The fox faunus, referred to as Legolas by the wolf, playfully rolled his eyes and poked Ray in the cheek, a chuckle escaping him.

Legolas (Fox Faunus): ‚ÄúChill, Ray! Mom and Dad mixed up the start date. They thought it was the same as when they went to Beacon. Not our fault they were off by... what, a week?‚Äù

Ray swatted Legolas‚Äôs hand away, exasperation written all over his face.

Ray: ‚ÄúI get it, but a whole week late? Instead of a regular airship, we‚Äôre flying through the sky like this? Using Finn as a human rocket while Odell's semblance is healing his exhaustion? Odell‚Äôs semblance is for healing, not‚Ä¶ whatever this is!‚Äù

Legolas shrugged, his grin widening.

Legolas: ‚ÄúBrother, getting into the 'why we‚Äôre late' discussion would take longer than the trip itself. Moving from Mistral to Vale was a mess‚Äîbetter to let Finn pop fire dust pills every few minutes and have Odell patch him up when he overdoes it.‚Äù

From Finn's back, the sleepy young man cracked his eyes open, looking down at them with a lazy smile.

Odell: murmuring ‚ÄúGuys, can we please not argue? We promised Mom and Dad we‚Äôd be on our best behavior... especially in front of the professors.‚Äù

Legolas: grinning ‚ÄúRight, right! They did say we should avoid causing too many ‚Äòproblems.‚Äô‚Äù He leans toward Ray. ‚ÄúEspecially you, Ray.‚Äù

Ray shot Legolas a deadpan stare, while Legolas smirked.

Ray: ‚ÄúLast I checked, you‚Äôre the one who can‚Äôt go a single day without pulling some kind of prank.‚Äù

Legolas mock gasping from Ray's response

Legolas: ‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs not my fault people can‚Äôt handle a little fun! It‚Äôs practically part of my charm!‚Äù

Ray raising an eyebrow as he responds.

Ray: ‚ÄúCharm? Last year, you swapped our last teacher‚Äôs coffee for milk. He thought he was losing it.‚Äù

Legolas grinned proudly, feeling no shame for his prank when they attend their previous school.

Legolas: ‚ÄúExactly! Totally harmless. Plus, too much coffee isn‚Äôt good for anyone. I was doing him a favor!‚Äù

Ray: ‚ÄúYou sent him home to ‚Äòrecover,‚Äô Legolas.‚Äù

Legolas: ‚ÄúAnd he got a day off!""

Finn, grinning at the playful banter of his brothers, shook his head before looking ahead, his expression lighting up with excitement.

Finn: ‚ÄúGuys, we‚Äôre almost there! I can see the city!‚Äù

In the distance, the sprawling city of Vale shimmered under the sun, the iconic Beacon Academy standing tall like a beacon of hope. The silver and blue towers sparkled on the horizon, majestic and inviting, as if they were calling the brothers home. Finn focused his energy, channeling his semblance to intensify the flames propelling them forward, shooting through the sky at exhilarating speed. The sudden burst of energy nearly sent Odell tumbling off, but he managed to grab the hem of Finn‚Äôs hoodie just in time, his heart racing.

Odell: ‚ÄúWhoa! That was too close‚Ä¶‚Äù

As Odell readjusted himself, Legolas couldn‚Äôt contain his excitement. His eyes sparkled with mischief as he leaned over the side.

Legolas: ‚ÄúOhhh, look at all those potential ‚Äòvictims‚Äô right ahead!‚Äù

Ray sighed, preparing to scold Legolas again, but Finn cut in, his enthusiasm infectious.

Finn: ‚ÄúGroup vote! Should we land in the city or‚Ä¶?‚Äù

He turned to his brothers, a wide grin spreading across his face.

Finn: ‚ÄúHow about we take a detour and fly around Beacon Academy before landing?‚Äù

Odell lightly nodded, showing he was up for a bit of exploration. Legolas bounced on his perch, clearly in favor of the second option, while Ray crossed his arms, contemplating their choices before letting out a resigned sigh.

Ray: ‚ÄúMight as well, it would help understand the layout...‚Äù

The three nodded, and Ray gave his approval for Finn to take them around Beacon Academy. He focused his aura to maintain the momentum, pushing them even faster across the sky.

\*\*\*

High above the city, the young group circled the perimeter of Beacon Academy, soaring over the sprawling grounds. Each brother reveled in the breathtaking view, laughter and shouts of excitement filling the air, until suddenly, a dust bullet zipped past them, forcing Finn to swerve wildly.

Finn: ‚ÄúWhoa! Hold on tight!‚Äù

Finn struggled to regain control as they hurtled toward one of the towering structures, the large window looming ominously ahead.

Finn: ‚ÄúCRASH LANDING IT IS!‚Äù

Odell: ‚ÄúOh dear‚Ä¶‚Äù

Ray: ‚ÄúYOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME‚Äî‚Äù

Legolas: ‚ÄúOH SHI‚Äî‚Äù

BOOM!

The sound of shattering glass echoed across the academy as the four brothers crashed through the window, tumbling onto the floor amid a shower of glass and debris. They groaned, slowly picking themselves up and assessing the chaotic scene. Ray blinked in disbelief as he looked around, realizing they had landed in what appeared to be a cluttered office filled with towering bookshelves and an ornate desk.

Ray: ‚ÄúIs everyone alright? Finn? Odell?‚Ä¶‚Äù

He sighed, pinching the bridge of his nose as he surveyed the chaos surrounding them.

Ray: ‚Äú...Legolas?‚Äù

Legolas grinned, brushing shards of glass off his vest.

Legolas: ‚ÄúReally feeling the sibling love right now, Ray.‚Äù

Odell: rubbing his head, a soft smile forming ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ that could have gone better. How about you, Finn? You were using your semblance for a while, so you must be low.‚Äù

Finn: ‚ÄúNah, I‚Äôm good, though I‚Äôm 100% sure I‚Äôm out of aura.‚Äù

Ray: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure what you expected, Finn. You were using your semblance without taking a break.‚Äù

Legolas laughed as he approached Ray, giving him a friendly pat on the back.

Legolas: ‚ÄúTo be fair, Ray, I don‚Äôt think anyone expected us to get shot at.‚Äù

Right now I am trying to dial in with [Ceremony Destroyer](https://ceremonycoffee.com/products/destroyer) (medium roast) but having a hard time getting within a palatable range. I had someone suggest doing a 1:3 ratio (though I was unsure since I have seen some standard ranges of ratios for each roast of coffee), so I was typically trying the following:

* 20-21g in
* 60g out
* Preinfusion Time: 6-7s
* Liquid Pour time: 25s

With the following, I feel like I was constantly getting a bitter taste. I ended up reducing my in to 18-19g and then felt like I was getting more of a sour taste. Has anyone here used Ceremony Destroyer and had success? If so, what brew ratio did you use? 

I mainly make lattes so it is easy to mask the mistakes I am making, but I would like to get to a point where I can somewhat enjoy drinking the espresso by itself.

Also, is there any website or app where people enter their variables (ex ratio, temp, in grams, etc) for the coffee they used? I feel like this would be beneficial for people trying to find their starting point, then refining it to their taste.

In line with my previous paragraph, does anyone know of any classes or in-person sessions near/in the Baltimore, MD area? I feel like I have watched a ton of James Hoffman and Lance Hedrick (even took notes on each of their videos) and I am still having a hard time dialing in. I am more of a hands-on learning kind of person which is why I feel like I am having a harder time being able to understand.",1,1729892752.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Basically, I am part of a very a small team, there's a few of us and one senior and then it's Big Boss. 

Senior is supposed to ""manage"" day to day but isn't our manager. 

The problem is, senior can not manage us day to day. There seems to be a superiority complex going on, some days they ""manage"" us aka assign tasks, some days they don't and it's entirely random so me and rest of the team have no idea what the day will look. 

Im always 15-20 minutes early (out of choice, I like to get a coffee and go through my emails so I know how my day is looking). 

Senior is consistently late with no communication that they're running late. I get traffic can be bad but some communication would be useful. Are you dead or just bad traffic? 

The other people have started commenting on the lateness, the lack of communication etc

There's also this odd... Gatekeeping and/or gaslighting? Like senior will say big boss said something, we ask boss, boss didn't say that, senior says they never said that. And a bunch of us heard them say that. 

We know that big boss and senior are talking about whatever we aren't involved with which is annoying because with a small team, I think transparency is important. 

Senior has told us ""big boss says x"", if we ask, big boss says no it's fine. So we're being given definite information that is... Entirely not true. 

We asked about something and big boss said he'd sent the info to senior. Senior said no they hadn't. Who's lying here? 

It's just becoming overwhelming... High school bully behavior, gatekeeping, one upping, gaslighting, bossy, confusion and just generally we have no idea what we don't know and genuinely concerned that senior might not be sharing info that could effect our jobs which means we could mess something up in big bosses eyes without them realising we dont know.

We want to collectively, as a team, bring up to the big boss the seniors behavior and how it isn't working. But we have no idea how. Big boss made senior the senior, so we're worried they will take it us questioning them and then we're fucked.

That was longer than I meant but essentially how do you constructively bring up that big boss is great but has made a bad decision with senior and it isnt working?",2,1729892678.0,managers,0,1.0,False

Sheila's Ass Shakin' Fan Video; The Girls Use A Half Mummified, Halloween Masked Sheila To Prank Night Staff In The Building ","Sheila's Perspective

I stand, still in my gimp hood mask, wearing the useless bondage latex dress that conceals nothing, arms bindered behind my back. My zipper gag is still zippered shut, this time over a nerfball. Strapped over my zippered shut mouth is a panel gag with a stick scrub brush.

I'm bent over in front of my school desk, nipple clamps on and chained to the desk. The scrub brush is stuck inside my coffee pot, which is filled with soapy water. Over that is my phone.

Basically, I'm still sandwiched between Mistress Sandy and Mistress Nora in their reclining chairs. Two hot young dommes, with their slightly older sub's tight young butt bent over prominently between them. The video is pretty simple, I clean the coffee pot, with Mistress Dao screaming at me. Nora and Sandy intersperse casual conversation, ignoring me, with slaps to my ass and bitchy comments to encourage me to clean the pot. If deemed necessary Dao moves up front to cane my ass, while Sandy orders Nora to go back and holler at me. It will edited into split screen, Mistress Dao harassing my gimp hooded head to the right, my ass swaying between my dommes to the left, for release on the Perseverance website. They have my phone next to the coffee pot because they're livestreaming the part with me being humiliated by my Mistresses to the Perseverance groupchat, they want me to watch. Dao smilingly assured me when the edited video was released Alpha Mary would force me to watch it. 

Dao yells ""And Action! Stop daydreaming, slave, and start scrubbing!"" I see her delicate, but powerful brown hand activate my phone as I start moving my head to scrub. I feel anger as I watch the pretty young brunette and blond domme bracket their slave's naked rear end. Little bitches. To be fair to them, I know their just trying to secure all our futures; do a good job humbling me so Queen Of Mean won't pull out of our project. But damn, do they have to enjoy it so much? Their big, lovely smiles don't seem forced.

On my phone screen, Mistress Sandy pipes up to my right. ""Hello everyone, I'm Mistress Sandy Connor, but you can call me Mistress Sandy."" She looks over at Nora. ""Hi, Perseverance fans, love you guys! You usually know me as Commander Dora Gail, but for the next few days, any film released on this site, I'll be Mistress Nora Jameson, or just Mistress Nora. Well, Mistress Nora to this asshole."" She giggles as she slaps my left ass cheek. I mmph at how hard the slap feels losing my rhythm. I regain it real quick when Dao gets up in my face and glares in it.

""You guys can just call me Nora."" On screen, Sandy gives my right ass cheek a much lighter tap, giggling as well. ""And who is this asshole, you ask? This is a legend in the new era of porn. She showed a unique way to be a lifestyle submissive with Sheila's Slave Blog and the Loser Girl series. She went on to be Chief Screen Writer and Top Domme on the hit sci/fi fetish show, the Perseverance.""

""Earlier this year, she did a fan service video where she submitted to her crew for two days. The popularity of it was beyond what was anticipated. Fans loved that Sheila naked was even more fit and sexy then she was as Loser Girl, and that she was still so good at subbing after working in leadership roles."" Sandy paused for breath.

I admittedly stopped scrubbing to listen to my sister's actually rather nice speech. Dao slapped her cane down so hard to my right, my phone jumped up and landed slightly askew. Dao growled, ""Scrub slave, this isn't break time!"" I started scrubbing as Dao's dusky hand straightened out my phone for me to view.

Nora took over. ""Many fans have asked if Sheila could return part time as a screen star, as she's still young and has many good years left. I want you to know, Sheila really appreciates you guys, and took your words to heart. Many of you pointed out in the old era of porn, women who were popular stars, went on to produce, direct, and other leadership roles, while still maintaining some screen presence. Sheila wants to prove the new school can do what the old school did, but even better!""

Sandy took up the refrain. ""So, back by popular demand, Sheila Nguyen Connor graciously starring as Slave Loser Girl. You guys watching should give her a big round of applause."" Sandy laughed and swatted my butt hard this time. I squealed but tried to keep scrubbing, though I noticed the brown was stubbornly not disappearing. Nora was actually right. I did need to clean out my coffeepot more often. Still, when this was over, ""Mistress"" Nora and I were going to have a long talk about tact.

Sandy's perspective

""So, Nora,"" I state casually, ""What is Slave Loser Girl working on now?"" Nora gave a wide smirk. ""Well, I walked into her office this morning. Well, it's MY office now, but anyway the first thing I saw was her nasty coffeepot, it looks like the little piglet never cleans it out. So I storm out to where she's tethered outside the Ready Room with it. I chewed her adorable slave butt out for her lack of cleanliness, waving that filthy pot in her face. I promised her she was going to clean it in the most humiliating manner I could dream up for her.""

Now I smirk. ""So, this is you keeping your promise to her?"" A beaming Nora said ""Yup. With the help of one of Queen Of Mean's beautiful apprentice dommes, Mistress Dao. Introduce yourself, dear."" Mistress Dao says. ""Hi, everybody, I'm Mistress Dao. I train this nasty, lazy slave good for Mistress Sandy and Mistress Nora."" Nora giggled.

Nora says ""She cleans up her mess, and gives fan service by swishing that pretty mongrel butt while she does it.""  She pointedly slaps my sister's cute nude butt, and says ""Work it, girl."" Nora, Stacy, who's shooting with a Gopro, and I share a laugh at her expense. She let's out an indignant mmmph, cut short when  we hear the harsh crack of Dao's bamboo cane coming down on the desk close to Loser Girl's face. ""Shut up, little loser slave. You a cutie, but so fucking stupid.""

Stacy casually asks ""Sandy dear, what's going to happen to Sheila over the next few days, dear?"" I grimace a little at the thought but try to keep a polite smile for the cameras. ""She's going to be sent for some remedial slave training to you guys compound, Stacy. Alpha Slave Mary, who you guys know as First Season's Captain Rommie Andromeda is going to mentor and train her to be a QOM approved quality bottom slave, get her a collar tag and certificate attesting to that fact."" 

Stacy says ""You'll be there as her domme, Mistress Sandy, and Alpha Slave Constance Anderson will be there to help you monitor the safety and welfare of your slave. We really would have liked to have you come, too, Mistress Nora, but Alpha Slave Mary has personal issues with you from her time as your bottom slave. We need her to focus on training Bottom Slave Loser Girl, not be distracted by a personal vendetta. Though since you share ownership with Sandy, you are permitted to come to the ceremony where she's certified a quality bottom slave, and accept her collar tag and certificate with Sandy. Alpha Slave Mary will have to be a professional and accept that.""

I slap my sister's ass and say ""Don't be shy, bend a little lower, spread a little wider, let these guys get a wink at the pink. Be proud sis, we have nice pussies."" My sister follows my command though she gives a low, indignantly mmph that seems to fly under Dao's radar.

I ask Stacy ""I know Queen Of Mean likes to maintain strict secrecy on some of your internal organizational tests and qualifications, but can you tell us anything about what Sheila might expect as slave Loser Girl?""

Stacy's smile beamed wide. ""Well, she might be made a Floormat Slave in the Domme Spa. Basically she's strapped in a cubby in the floor, under a domme's Spa chair. Usually the only thing sticking out is the slaves face Open mouth gagged and tightly cramped. Sometimes we modify it so her breasts are out as well. If a Domme wishes, while she's getting groomed, massaged and pampered, the slave can lick her feet. Some dommes rest their feet on a slaves face. A few like to practice breath control on the slave with their feet, but this is carefully monitored by trained safeties. Any Domme caught stomping or kicking a slave's face or breasts is immediately removed. If she's one of us, she may find her association with our organization terminated. A guest domme risks a ban from our property, possibly for life. We give the slave support in filing criminal or civil charges, especially if they're injured. But most dommes, whether ours or guests, that have spa privileges are too professional to do something like that.""

I said ""You sure go to great lengths to protect your slaves, Stacy."" Her reply was ""Of course, dear. We're not heathens. All our subs are volunteers. We believe in safe and consensual, if some say our practices aren't exactly sane."" 

I smiled back at her for forms sake. What she said was technically true. But  from what I know of Mary, Constance and Sheila's case, they loved using financial pressure for consent, and legal technicalities to extend slave's sentences.

At least in Constance's and Sheila's case it was understandable. Constance tried to run QOM out of business, then had the nerve to apply for a position with them when it backfired on her. Sheila annoyed them when she was temp subbing, so they picked on her. When she was free she retaliated any way she could. So they picked on her more when she temp subbed. A vicious cycle hopefully we could break in three days.

Poor Mary. If I got the story straight, her worst sin was being too mean to Sarah at first because of a personal vendetta from their time in the Navy together. Everyone admitted she backed off a lot when Dave and Sheila talked to her about it.

Then Nora's character becomes the fan favorite. And Mary's not as popular with the Perseverance cast and staff, either. So the cool kid gets her star billing, on the show Mary created. She spends the second season as a slave, on and off screen, while the girl who stole her spotlight is her Mistress and treats her like shit. Sheila knew it wasn't right, but was willing to throw her under the bus for the show's continued success. I could see why Mary was eager to get her hands on Sheila as a slave for a couple of days. I had nothing against her, even kind of understood. But I was going to remind her, Domme to Slave, that Sheila's my sister, and be careful in her payback.

""I thought the ""Shark Tank"" was a little over the top."" I was still smiling wanly. Stacy
 laughed uproariously. ""Yes, it was nice of Sheila to volunteer to sub for that as well. She's been so helpful this season, filling in and Temp subbing as an extra,  volunteering for the Shark Tank, and now wanting to get certified as an approved quality bottom slave, under the mentorship of her old friend, Mary."" 

I said ""Uh, yeah, that's Sheila, alright, always willing to help out. Uh, Dao is that pot almost clean? We have a slave to train to as close to perfect obedience as we can tonight.""

Dao replied ""It's getting there, Mistress Sandy."" I heard her bamboo cane whack down on the desk. ""Hurry up, slave, so we can start training you."" She hollered at my hapless sister.

Nora replied ""Good, we're going to need some coffee tonight, I'm going to break out Sheila's French Roast. For Dommes only, when we're done with her the slave will need her sleep."" Nora waited for an angry reaction, and seemed disappointed she didn't get one. Then she grinned. ""I know you're mad Sheila, but we're not breaking our promise. We said we wouldn't mess with your clothes, hat or coffee cup. We didn't promise not to get into your coffee and snacks. Feel lucky we're not drinking your booze, I kept the copy I made of your liquor cabinet key the last time you subbed for us.""

I could tell by how her breathing changed, she was mad. But she was becoming a disciplined slave again, smart enough to know objection was futile right now. I was proud of her, but needed to test how far we could push, for her sake.

""Tomorrow night when I get back, let's get into her booze and toast her in the Ready Room. We'll stream it to Dao and Mary, so they can show it to her while she's lying mummified, strapped down in a diaper. Our good night to our beloved Loser Girl!"" Both Nora and I broke up in giggles at the thought.

Now Sheila started to mmph angrily. Dao brought down the bamboo cane again on the desk near her face and told her to shut up. I swatted her nude right ass cheek with my left hand and told her to ""Keep shakin' it, bitch."" She obeyed quietly, to her credit.

Stacey piped up with ""Ladies, why don't we wrap this up so you can send the footage down to the production office for editing. I want you to know that you can make this a first in a series of Sheila/Loser Girl fan service videos. We'll sponsor some filming in designated areas of Loser Girl's training.""
Nora's eyes lighted up, she looked so excited. ""That would be great!"" I'll work on a fan portal on our site just for Slave Sheila videos."" I felt kind of bad, we were doing all the humiliating things Ari...and I...did to her before. There were more limits, technically she consented...and it was for a good cause. Still, I felt a little sorry we were having so much cruel fun at her expense.

I decided we could at least wrap the video now, like Stacy suggested. I held up my hand over Loser Girl's still shaking ass in the shape of a half a heart. Nora got it and completed the other half. We both said ""We love you guys, the Perseverance fans, for watching and keeping us relevant. Sheila loves you guys, and wants to tell you thank you. Sheila, thank all the nice Masters and Mistresses out there watching!"" I ordered.

Sheila remained stubbornly silent, until Dao struck the desk again, hard. ""Next one goes on your nude loser ass, slave!"" The short Asian Domme warned. Sheila mmmphed ""I love you, Masters and Mistresses! Thank you, Masters and Mistresses."" Nora and I broke our hand heart to giggle like middle school mean girls at her desperate enthusiasm. Stacy and Dao laughed at her, too.

Nora and I blew kisses at the camera, and I said ""Goodbye for now, sexy boys and girls."" Stacy yelled ""And Cut!""  Sheila stopped shaking her ass, obviously exhausted. Dao slapped down her bamboo cane again with another loud smack. ""Keep shaking it and cleaning the pot slave!"" She shouted. 

I felt sorry for her, but I was going to let her stop and rest in a few minutes. I thought about reassuring her, but decided she needed to learn unquestioning obedience immediately, and it was bad to look like I was undercutting another domme in front of the slave. I shook my head to clear it. Not a slave, my sister Sheila temp subbing. I wanted to avoid the trap of dehumanizing her while she was powerless.

Nora said ""Since it's close to Halloween, I have an idea how we can have some spooky fun, and train our slave to obey orders unquestioningly."" She glanced at Sheila's still shaking, if flagging, cute ass.
""We should talk in the passageway, outside the slave's earshot.""

I asked ""Who's going to watch her?"" Dao eagerly volunteered ""I will, Mistress Sandy!"" Her eagerness as she leered at my again pretty slave sibling made me wary, but I shook it off and I took charge. ""Sheila, sweetie, you can stop shaking your ass and cleaning our coffeepot."" She gratefully stopped, and I could tell her sides were heaving, poor thing was tired. 

""Mistress Dao, disconnect her nipples and take off the scrub brush gag. Mistress Nora, help Dao secure Sheila in her school chair. Once you're done join Mistress Kealoha and I out in the passageway to discuss your plan. We'll text Dao so the slave doesn't know anything before we're ready for her, too. Mistress Dao, hydrate her, and comfort and reassure her, please. She's tough, but it's been a hard day for her, and it's not over.""

Nora and Dao worked quick, detaching Sheila's nipple clamps and turning her around seating her at her school desk and strapping her in. When she heard my last sentence she started to groan, Nora stopped tightening the strap under her breasts to give her a dominatrix glare. Sheila's eyes flicked left briefly, and her Mistress's hard gaze shut her up quick. Nora really was a good lezzy domme who knew how to control older girls.

Once Nora gave me the thumbs up Slave Sheila was firmly secured to her seat, I gestured her out into the hallway to join Stacy, who was already there. 

I noticed Dao in my seat fondling Sheila's left breast with that...hungry...grin. Shiela was gazing at her like a trussed up gazelle would gaze at a tigress. Helpless prey watching her predator stalk it, the predator licking it's chops. I may ask Stacy to watch Dao closer while Mary is training her. Then I turned to the business at hand.

Just as the door closed I heard Dao coo ""Don't be frightened, pretty little slave, Dao take good care of you..."" it sounded more like a come on than a reassurance. I was pretty sure the Thai domme was just messing with my sexy older sister. But we'd take precautions, just in case...

Sheila's perspective

I'm standing outside the break room door waiting quietly for the young man who went into the breakroom to come out. I'm still gimp hooded, but the frilly maid headpiece is gone. Instead, I have a ridiculous clown fright mask strapped over my face. My mouth is still zipper gagged over a nerf ball. I'm grateful my mouth isn't dry or my throat parched. My Domme/sister Sandy remembered to hydrated me when that sadistic, rapey Thai cunt Dao ""Forgot"".

Instead of being armbindered, I'm mummified from neck to waist in black vet wrap and cling film, my arms trapped at my sides. Those bitches left my breasts hanging out, with HAPPY HALLOWEEN! DO YOU LIKE MY BOOOOOBS? written across them in orange and black body marker.

I have a tray around my waist with various items of candy on it, anchored in place by clamps on my nipples and chains attached to the tray. I'm nude from the waist down, the body writing saying LOSER HOLE, with an arrow pointing down to my shaved pussy, still there. Of course, the writing on my bare ass is still there. The only thing I'm wearing on my lower half is a pair my black walking flats. Nora and Dao wanted to make me wear platform.or spike heels. Luckily, my little sister is showing some mercy, instead of channeling her inner Ari. She insisted to the other two I wear my practical shoes.

Basically I'm being walked around the building, used to prank the night staff. So far the sight of a half mummified, half naked girl with a fright mask strapped to her face has scared the crap out of three other people. A guy and a girl who spent a half hour bullshiting in the break room before they came out. Mistress Nora made me wait the whole half hour outside the break room door for them, threatening dire consequences over my ear mike if I made a sound.

They of course started and exclaimed to see the mummy girl with a clown mask on and her girl parts hanging out. To be honest they suprised me, too, when they finally came out; a muffled cry around my the nerf ball zippered in my mouth. Nora had crouched around the corner, and came out in her devil costume, proclaiming ""Happy Halloween!"" 

Both her and Sandy wore red devil's horns, red cape, and a plastic pitchfork. Nora liked playing ""bratty devil domme"" to the hilt. Including poking my butt with the plastic pitchfork while ordering me to move faster. It didn't hurt, but was annoying as fuck.

Nora apologized ""Sorry if we frightened you, just having some Halloween fun to liven things up. Please, help yourself to some candy."" 

The guy, a dark haired crew cut guy, with gym muscles he obviously liked to show off, even in his dress shirt, kind of leered at Nora. ""Hey, I know you, you're Nora Jameson, the star of the show. Aren't you a little old for childish pranks, sweetheart? Not that I was scared, or anything.""  The woman, a plain but not unattractive long haired strawberry blond, frowned at the interest the guy was showing in Nora.

I couldn't quite recall his name, but I remember he was one of the guys that always had a ""reason"" to be on set when one of the girls was naked and/or tied up. His reasons always checked out, and he never openly harassed any of us, so there was little I could do besides keep an eye on him. The way his eyes were avidly crawling over Nora made my blood boil.

My young protege, my Domme for the moment, seemed oblivious. Hard as it is to believe, some of her naive innocence hasn't completely disappeared. ""Oh, come on Simon, you're never to old to have a little fun on Halloween."" She smiled her innocent smile, so sweet compared to the predatory, salacious gaze she gave my trussed up slave ass earlier.

""Hmmm. I guess you're right, honey."" Then his gaze turned on me, his leer widened as he looked at my bare breasts. ""Speaking of candy, who's this sweet little thing? She looks good enough to eat, except for that dumb clown mask."" The blond, Addie from production, had leaned forward to examine my security badge, clipped to the vet wrap above my right breast.

Too be fair, they didn't clip it on me to humiliate me, but so I could be quickly ID'd, along with my domme, if anyone came upon us and wanted to know if we were authorized to be there, or trespassers. But the small smile that came on Adie's face as she recognized who I was from my ID seemed mocking, I was glad I was hooded as well as Halloween masked so I couldn't be seen to be reddening. ""Miss Connor?"" She asked tentatively, like she was unsure. I could tell by her eyes she was positive who I was. I reluctantly mmmmphed ""Yes.""

Simon Guffawed. ""How did you get her to play along, as a submissive? Or did ol'Dave get tired of being pussy whipped and decide to put her in her place?"" Adie elbowed him, but she was smiling widely now as she looked at me.

Nora chuckled. ""She agreed to be a submissive for a little while to show she was still humble and remembers where she came from."" Nora reached into the pouch between my breasts to hold out my infraction book to them. ""You can wish her a Happy Halloween in this, or anything else you want to write to her. Just remember she will be ""Boss Bitch"" again, eventually."" Nora helpfully proffered a pen to them. 

Simon eagerly grabbed the book and wrote in it with hasty, excited strokes. Then he gave it to Adie, who wrote in a more even, measured manner. She handed the book back to Nora, who giggled at what they wrote, looking at me. Then she turned the book so I could read it.

""Happy Halloween, Sugar Tits! I like your costume."" Signed with a messy, hasty scrawl. A neater line below it read ""Happy Halloween, Miss Connor. Hope you get to pick your own costume next year."" Signed very neatly at the end. Yeah, I hope so too, Adie.

""Grab some candy before you go."" Nora brightly offered. Adie demured, but Simon smugly stated ""Don't mind if I do grab me some sweet stuff, babe."" He reached towards the back of the tray, as close to my tits as he could without touching them, and grabbed a big handful of candy. If that bastard had so much as brushed my boobs with a knuckle...the moment I was free I'd hunt him down like a wild dog.

Nora watched them walk off. Then she looked at me and giggled ""Sugar tits."" She laughed to herself. I glared at her through my hood and the stupid clown mask. Put the make on me when I'm helpless...and laugh at me...maybe I did need to calibrate this little bitch when I was free.

I heard someone come around the corner and braced myself for more humiliation. I felt a little relieved when I heard Sandy say ""Sorry I'm late Nora, I'm not used to the walk from the Guard Booth. Anything you need to turn over to me?""

The little bitches were alternating roaming the halls using me to prank people. They'd go an hour to an hour and a half each, when one wanted a break she'd text the other to relieve her. Of course, as a slave, no real breaks for me.

""No, Sandy, she's been a really, good patient girl, I haven't had to discipline her.""
Sandy's looked at her peer pointedly. ""Have you checked in with her about hydration and bathroom breaks?"" Nora looked sheepish and snuck a guilty glance at me. ""Uh, no."" Sandy sighed and looked at her friend with disappointment. Again, I appreciated my sister's newfound maturity. It took her domming me again for me to really see it, but I'm still grateful I get to know this side of her. I believe I can trust her not to get carried away at QOM's compound tomorrow, unlike Nora.

Now my sister is looking pointedly at me. ""Sheila, do you need water? To go to the bathroom? Just a regular break?"" I mmmphed ""Break and something to drink,  Mistress Sandy."" She nods at the breakroom. ""We'll sit down in there, I'll buy you whatever you want from the vending machine and let you rest a little.""

She turns back to Nora. ""They got a Spades game going and Sheila's coffeepot set up brewing her French Roast. Grab a cup. Make sure someone is watching the approach to the breakroom, so if someone comes by we have time to set up for a proper prank."" Nora holds out her hand for a fist bump, and Sandy lightly punches it.
Nora looks a little pained, though I'm sure my sister didn't intend to hurt her friend.

As Nora walks off, I dutifully follow Sandy into the breakroom. She gently helps me sit. ""Let's get this silly thing off of you gor a bit, sweetie."" She takes off the clown mask. For which I'm grateful. She unlocks my hood zipper, unzips it, and has me spit the nerf ball into her hand.

She takes my order of a cherry Pepsi and heads to the machine to get it.It's odd that if I have to be a slave again, I'm glad Sandy's my domme. Hopefully, this is the last time.

Also, I no longer feel the constant urge to make a joke or try to provoke reactions from others; I naturally feel more respectful.

I feel more optimistic about my abilities. I feel somewhat smarter (might be a placebo effect). I feel more secure in myself and my value as a person instead of feeling like a random individual always struggling to do basic tasks. It feels amazing.  
I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôve missed out on this for most of my childhood. I don‚Äôt know what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù feels like for people without ADHD, but I feel like I‚Äôm experiencing it now. It‚Äôs like all the good effects of coffee but better and without the negative effects on my anxiety and sleep.

1gc5i3r,https://www.reddit.com/r/PointlessStories/comments/1gc5i3r/a_slightly_surreal_camping_night/,A slightly surreal camping night,"It is a summer night in august, the weather is nice and the nights are quite warm. I am at summer camp. We are sleeping in a large tent with about 5 people and loads of room, about 20 people could fit in the tent if you tried. We went to sleep a bit late as we were just enjoying ourselves, so we probably started sleeping around 1 am. We are just sleeping with sleeping bags and small air mattresses and our bags with stuff have exploded as we needed them for carrying groceries the day before, which made a complete mess of the whole tent. 

Anyway, we were sleeping and it's about 3 am when I feel something. There is something large moving between my legs. To the people assuming what it is, no it's not that. It is large and is moving on top of my sleeping bag. I am kinda confused as I am still half a sleep. I decide to just look and see if what I feel is actually something or if I am just making things up. Now when I look up, I am met with the face of a cat staring back at me from between my legs. I then at a speaking tone just say ""what the actual fuck"", as this is a random ass cat that we haven't even seen before. This wakes most people in the tent. Now I know that my friend sleeping next to me is really afraid of cats, so I try to explain to her that she should not panic and that there is a cat between my legs. She just sits straight up fueled with fear but doesn't actually scream or anything. I start to move my legs so that hopefully the cat does. The cat does. The cat however does not move out of the tent, but instead just went to settle in someones stuff at a more empty side of the tent.

Sigh.

Now since my friend is afraid of cats, letting that cat roam around the tent is not an option unless we are of the opinion that my friend does not deserve to sleep this night. So I get out of my sleeping bag and move over to the cat, which just stays put and does not care. Now I am not really afraid of cats, but I don't wanna try picking up a cat and having it possibly panick in a tent with an exit that is not too clear. So I try to find something that I can chase it away with. I look around the tent and find the perfect object. A fairly large moka pot (the things for coffee), I grab it and just scootch closer to the cat slowly waving the moka pot in it's general direction, which indeed does not like it and it starts moving. I start to crawl after it, waving the moka pot and directing it at the exit. And the cat exits! Whoo! The whole tent is now awake and just a bit flabbergasted at what the fuck was going on. Which is fair enough.

Now however I think that it is a good idea to block the entrance such that the cat can't come back in. This however isn't as easy as just zipping the tent shut. The entrance of the tent is a triangle with 2 flaps, the flaps are attached at the angled parts of the triangle and can be bound tight in the middle, the floor however can't be tightened down or anything. So I just start moving as much stuff as possible to block the floor and make a bit of a wall in the middle so that the cat can't get past the middle flap for sure.

Once the blockade has been constructed I just stand for a min to think over if I have indeed just experienced, I decide that that is not the time to do that. I go back to my sleeping bag and stare a bit at the ceiling of the tent and go to sleep.

15 minutes later I get woken up by my friend shaking my shoulder and asking whether the cat is right about where my shoulders are. Turns out that from about 30 cm distance she thought my shoulders were the cat and decided to shake the shoulders which she has just mistaken to be a cat to ask whether the shoulders she just shook is the cat. Fear can do weird things... I calm her down and laugh a bit in her face as it was really funny and go to sleep again.

An hour later I hear stuff moving. I don't even want to know and just assume that it's the wind or someone else getting up. Then I hear more moving. Then I hear the definite sound of a cat purring. Am I dreaming? I open my eyes and look down between my legs, nothing there. Let's look around, nothing. I guess it was nothing? No way the cat could have gotten through the barricade of like 15 bags and random stuff. 

10 seconds later I hear stuff moving again, I decide to get a flashlight out and look. The cat is indeed back and laying in between all kinds of stuff. 

I get out of my sleeping bag, find my trusty moka pot and scootch towards the cat. When I'm close to the cat I again move the moka pot in its general direction. This time however the cat does not move. I wave it a bit more, still nothing. Has the moka pot worn out its magical cat deferring powers? I decide to see if touching the cat with the moka pot does anything different, the cat immediately jumps away on first touch! The cold metal must have not been too nice to touch. Now the whole crawly after cat section repeats itself, eventually the cat just jumps at the tent flaps and somehow gets through at the bottom, acting like it was the easiest thing in the world.

With as much pride as I can show in my half naked sleep deprived crawling on all fours state I wave the moka pot in the air victoriously. The tent again has been woken up, just all laughing and not knowing what the fuck just happened yet again. We will need to fix the barricade however to have a better chance of keeping the cat out. So I get more bags and just dump them where the cat went through and I hoped for the best. Time for sleep again.

Another hour later I get woken up yet again by sounds, this time they are a bit different. They are not of our stuff in the tent, but rather a more tent filling sound. I lay for a few minutes hearing the sounds multiple times. Then I see the tent sides move next to my feet. The cat apparently decided that sleeping right next to the tent was the next best thing. Fair enough, can't blame it. I go to sleep again.

During the night I keep waking up hearing sounds, sometimes it's something, sometimes it's just the cat outside. But the cat never came back in.

The next morning everyone from the tent was just still star struck at whether the things that happened really happened. I knew for sure as I barely slept, but the others were in a more sleepy state so they were just confused. In the end it was very fun and a nice memory to have shared together.

So ive been with my girlfriend for 6 years now, she‚Äôs a 5,6 blondie with blue eyes. Pretty curvy girl. and she has known about my fetish for at least 4 years now. 

One week before october 6th, i asked her if she would be down to have a session on the next weekend and she was down. I told her that i was going to cook her gassy food from Friday to Sunday to make sure she would be extra gassy. So for friday and saturday i gave her a bunch of stuff to make her farts stink the most possible ( i made another post about that go check it out ). Sunday morning, i took her to a breakfast restaurant et she ate a whole bunch of stuff. When we got home she drank her special coffee, ate her special candy, and then we did our things both our ways until all of it kicked in.

Fast forward to like 3 hours later. she tells me ¬´¬†lets go to the room im feeling it¬†¬ª so we went in our room and she layed on her side while i layed in her back with my face in her ass. (Like my legs were where her head was and my face in her butt) A couple of minutes goes by and i can hear her gut going crazy, rumbling like hell was going to come out of there. Then she tells me to lay on my back and that she will sit on my face so i oblige. She‚Äôs now sitting her huge butt in my face completely naked asshole directly pointing in my mouth ( im really into mouth farts) I feel her asshole pushing and she lets out trumpet like fart. I could taste that what i had been giving her to eat worked really well cause it was some of the nastiest farts i ever had from her, just awful. She then told me ¬´¬†i feel like im going to shit¬†¬ª So my heart
h started racing like crazy but i was so horny that i just did a thumbs up üëç. she told me ¬´¬†tap on my leg 2 times if you want me to stop¬†¬ª and she started pushing again. First she dropped a pretty big fart, 2-3 seconds at least, same horrible smell. then maybe 15 seconds later she dropped 4 back to back little toots that really felt like she was about to shit right there and then, and maybe 20 seconds later another big 2-3 second fart that was really wet and i knew that more was coming right there so i tapped 2 times and she went to the bathroom. When she came back she told me
to lay on my side like we were at the beginning and that big farts were coming. She wasnt lying. I placed my face in her butt and she started unleashing absolute monsters right in my mouth back to back. She had just shitted but the taste/smell was still absolutely putrid and i was absolutely euphoric. And from there we switched from on our side to face sitting a couple times and she kept letting huge farts for like 3 hours non stop it was by far the best session we ever had. i took a couple of break in between to give her a good reward üçÜ. She had so much gas even when i was completely empty she was still there ripping ass the whole evening and the whole night. I had never seen my girlfriend this gassy and i fear she might not ever get as gassy as this. in 2 weeks we will do the exact same process again and see if we can do it again.

1gc5bei,https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1gc5bei/how_to_make_friends_in_baltimore_and_beyond/,How to Make Friends in Baltimore (and Beyond!) ,"(Hi! I posted this a few months ago, but it got deleted because when I linked to something it was flagged as sales. Sorry about that! Posting again in response to some common posts on this thread--which I love! Hope that's OK with everybody üòÉ) 



Hello good people of Baltimore reddit---

I wanted to share some strategies I have found to make friends here in our friendly  Charm City. Though I am now a pretty big extrovert, when I came to Baltimore 11 years ago, I was definitely much more shy and introverted. We often see posts on this page for people looking for friends/ways to make friends--here's what I'd (sorry, unsolicited!) suggest:

1. Take a class at the Baltimore Improv Group (or another improv theater in town!). Even if you don't see yourself having a future in improv or performing comedy, this is a low-stakes, fairly cost effective way to meet people and get out of your head a little bit. Oftentimes, classmates go out afterwards to Royal Blue or other nearby bars to get to know each other. This is tip 1a--if nobody is pitching the ""hang out after class,"" you can! People will come!

Tip 1b is to find something else you like--- there are pretty huge board game, Dungeons and Dragons, Volo Sports, etc. scenes here.

2. Become a regular at a coffee shop or bar. Baltimore is genuinely known for its friendliness, and most places here you can strike up a bit of small talk to get to know someone. If you follow a certain sports team, that's a great in to find ""your team's"" local bar. Even if you're not going to make your lifelong friends at your local bar/coffeehouse, it's still¬†**good practice on small talk, which is definitely essential to making lifelong friends.**¬†Chitchat matters! Talking to strangers is the only way to make new friends. If you want to make new friends, you do have to a- leave your house sometimes and b- chat with people in a casual, just shooting the breeze kind of way. (After a few times seeing/ chatting with the same people at one location, then you can pitch a second location! Or a phone number share!) Dutch Courage was always my favorite.

3. Go to events at the Enoch Pratt Central Library. Go alone, and when you're in line to get the famous person to sign your book, chat with the people near you. We have truly the world's best library here. (I also often recommend the Greedy Reads Water Taxi cruise to people who like books and are a little more shy.)

4. I don't see this tip posted here a lot, but Baltimore has a pretty significant transplant scene. There just might be someone you used to know who also lives here now. Pitch something low-stakes for your first reunion hang---maybe vintage arcade games at Game On?

5. If you get invited to something, go! It will be weird for the first 5 minutes when you get there and you only know the host. This is allowed, and you can get through it.

Sorry if this is annoying or not want people want, but I love Baltimore, and I want to see more people here staying and happy. (I moved to NYC three weeks ago, and I'm using these tips again myself! I miss Baltimore!) You gotta get out of the house, and you gotta make chitchat with strangers. Dorky closing-small talk can lead to real friendships!!",15,1729891886.0,baltimore,1,1.0,False

It may also seem easy to assume I could just go have the burger or don't, but it's not that easy at all.

I, for one, rarely eat takeout (0-4√ó a year). Secondly, I rarely eat meat (less than 10√ó a year), as there's no such thing as a Vegan; only Herbivores, Vegetarians, and whatever a meatless dieter is. Vegan isn't something or someone that can exist because everything in existence is interdependent and the Earth itself eats rotten, decayed meat!

1gc5aaw,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1gc5aaw/copilot_ai_agent_in_obsidian/,Copilot - AI Agent in Obsidian,"Hi friends, Logan here, the creator of the copilot plugin. Thanks to the Obsidian community, the plugin now has over 230K downloads!

I just released v2.7 recently and introduced a new ‚Äúcopilot plus‚Äù mode (in closed alpha now). The idea is to shift to an agentic architecture to cover more use cases. If you are interested in joining the alpha test, please consider sponsoring the project on Github (please have your email info on your github account!) or buy me coffees!

# Time-based queries

One of the most common use cases in PKM is to have recaps, summaries for a period and spaced repetition. I'd like to ask Copilot for a recap or extract certain information from whatever flexible time range expressed in natural language

‚ÄúGive me a recap of my week‚Äù

‚ÄúList all my #ideas from August‚Äù

‚ÄúHow have my understanding of topic X improved from aug 10 to oct 5‚Äù

‚ÄúBased on my current progress, what should be my new pace if I‚Äôd like to finish the project by the end of the year‚Äù

Any of these queries don't work out-of-the-box with ChatGPT, Claude, or any other LLMs even if you provide all your docs to them because they don‚Äôt have the ability to get the current time and use the provided time range to extract, summarize, or reason. That is where the ""\*\*agentic\*\*"" Copilot Plus comes in.

Besides time-based reasoning, Copilot Plus has access to many other tools, and the toolbox will expand over time. For example, it can call the¬†\*\*local vault search\*\*¬†tool to answer questions based on your vault, much like how you use \`@codebase\` in Cursor. This tool is an upgraded version of the existing vault QA mode with better semantic hybrid search. It has better support for full-text and vector search combined, plus reranking to help improve the final answer quality while having your docs local without uploading to a cloud db or vector search service.

Copilot Plus also has other tools like web search and YouTube video to markdown, markdown to mindmap generation, etc.

UI-wise, Copilot Plus will be very similar to Cursor where you can use ""cmd + enter"" for \`@vault\`, or you can use a \`+\` button to add files as context explicitly. It will also have image support. You can think of it as Cursor inside Obsidian but optimized for writing and research rather than coding.

I also plan to support multimodal search in the near future so you can search for content in images and charts in PDFs just by chatting with Copilot.

Here‚Äôs a discussion for feature suggestions please share yours!¬†\[https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/discussions/726\](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot/discussions/726)

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

Dawn broke. An ever familiar layer of pudles upon the pavement glistened in the morning sunlight, as did the droplets of rain falling from the cloudy grey sky. Matteo sat in the windowsill of his bedroom, within a third floor flat, clad in dark, thick pyjamas, beside a stack of half read text books on his left, clutching a steaming hot, bitter, black coffee within his pale hands trying to keep them warm. He looked out as far as the fog allowed him at the sea of tall, brutalist flats and coughed, but instead of covering his mouth, as he usually would, he kept hold of his coffee and coughed into the air, unbothered. 

God only knew what the time was. He had woken up at silly o'clock again, as he was almost accustomed to despite it being a Saturday. God only knew why. It was not because he didn't care to know why but rather every time Matteo pondered, and pondered, and pondered, he didn't find a sufficient enough solution that satisfied him, and so he kept pondering.

He took a sip of his coffee and, for as long as he could, savoured its bitter yet comforting flavour. With each sip, his eyes slowly crept open. He signed, coughed, and sneezed and sneezed again which finally made him place his coffee down on the windowsill, without a coaster, to complete the marathon between his bedroom, a messy, muted modern room with a decently sized lonely double bed with slightly yellowed white covers, to the bathroom to grab a role of tissue paper. Maybe the reason he awoke was simply his cold, or at worst the flu, he thought to himself for a long enough time for him to put off the question and ignore it until it would inevitably arise again. 

Matteo returned to the windowsill and threw himself back on it, barely avoiding his coffee, hitting the window with a thud forceful enough to make it shake a little, and the soprano voice of a crying baby sounded from above, its song a wordless ballad consisting of only high-pitched wails carrying one meaning, a request for comfort from its mum or dad. Matteo giggled, placed the roll of tissues on his left, and took another sip of his coffee, and after the bitter sip, he ceased laughing and just sat in silence listening to the music he had just haphazardly created and for the sake of him and everyone else in the block of flats he hoped the parents would be able to soothe them quick and thankfully they did. Matteo wished he could be like them. After plenty more coughs and splutters and a few more sweet, bitter sips, he pushed himself off the windowsill, laid on his bed, and stared at the ceiling. Despite the caffeine, he drifted back to sleep.

The sun's rays peered in through the window, and as he slowly shifted out of bed, he noticed something; beautiful white confetti like snowflakes were fluttering down from the now light grey sky. The last time Matteo had seen snow was over 6 years ago when Matteo was just 13, and Jesus did it snow. By comparison, this was a mild sprinkle, but he hoped that it would pick up, and he would once again see streets covered in a blanket of snow and feel his two blue eyes widened with awe and hear the satisfying crunch beneath his welly clad feet as he trudged through the snow. Please pick up, he wished, please.

Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! Vroom! 

His phone vibrated atop his bedside cabinet, which shook his water and medicine bottles upon it. Matteo picked up the phone, sat on his bed, looked at the time (10:42), and saw it was his mum calling on WhatsApp and answered it.

‚ÄúHave you seen the weather?‚Äù She asked.
‚ÄúI just woke up now, yeah.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs it snowing for you?‚Äù 
‚ÄúA little, though it looks as if it's gonna pick up. Take a look.‚Äù

Matteo enabled video call and pointed his camera outside to show his mum a panoramic view from outside his window before turning his camera back off and sitting upon his bed.

‚ÄúLooks beautiful. You've got more snow than we've got. Take a look.‚Äù 

Matteo prepared himself to stomach the painfully happy memories, seeing even just a snapshot of his childhood home would trigger. To see the oak tree upon the green through the front window surrounded by the horseshoe shaped road they lived on covered in snow as more snow fluttered down from the heavens above, would send him straight back to when he was 13, or 10, or 9, or 5, or 4. Straight back to a time when he could simply watch the snow fall and if it was thick enough, brave the elements to play in it with his friends, like when he was 9 and he had a snowball fight with his friends, Thomas and Albie, Jesus when did he last see them? Matteo couldn't even remember. I should text them, he thought as his chest tightened.

After the battles had ended, Matteo would go inside and be greeted by the warm embrace of his Dad's delicious, sweet hot chocolate topped with a tower of whipped cream which he drank wrapped in a blanket with a The Lego Movie on in the living room. Good times. Good times. A tear formed in Matteo's eye.

‚ÄúMum the cameras off,‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, bumholes, how do I-‚Äù
‚ÄúDon't worry about it, it's fine.‚Äù
‚ÄúYou sure?‚Äù
‚ÄúI'm sure.‚Äù

Matteo looked out upon the snow again, hypnotised by them swirling in the chilly breeze, and he winced.

‚ÄúHello? Are you there?‚Äù His mum asked loudly. 
‚ÄúI'm here, sorry I zoned out,‚Äù Matteo replied, slightly hoarse and quiet. 
‚ÄúAre you OK darling?‚Äù his mum asked. 
‚ÄúMostly.‚Äù
‚ÄúWhy mostly?‚Äù
‚ÄúMy cold is pretty bad.‚Äù
‚ÄúIs that all?‚Äù
Matteo hesitated for a moment, spluttered, then replied,
‚ÄúYes, that's all.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow's uni?‚Äù
‚ÄúFine, I'm doing well.‚Äù
‚ÄúThat's good. Do ya feel accepted?‚Äù
‚ÄúI'm not out yet.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt's been a year, Mat,‚Äù His mum replied in the way you'd expect a mum too, typically maternal.
‚ÄúI know, I know. I'm still keeping it quiet, I don't wanna repeat of secondary. Hopefully, those who'll need to know will know, ya know.‚Äù
‚ÄúTalking about getting a boyfriend.‚Äù
Matteo giggled, ‚ÄúHopefully, hopefully.‚Äù 
‚ÄúI gotta go,‚Äù Matteo said quickly, ‚ÄúI'll see you soon,‚Äù 
‚ÄúBye, bye.‚Äù

Whether or not Matteo would see his mum soon was not a guarantee. He said it more out of habit, though he did want to see her soon.

Matteo hung up the phone, coughed, and after he did, he noticed a message from his friend Ant on the group chat, ‚ÄúOi wankers we still going pub tonight?‚Äù Matteo sighed. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù He replied, not allowing himself to break the promise he said to him two days ago. ‚ÄúAnyone coming come round mine at 9pm OK?‚Äù  He typed the letter ‚ÄúO‚Äù and, after a moment of pondering, finished with the letter ‚Äúk‚Äù and sent it. 

Great, he thought, now he had to get ready for this evening. Just what he wanted, laborious socialising.

Matteo stood up, groaning as he did, and noticed the coffee cup he left on the windowsill. He shuffled over and tried to pick it up but it had stubbornly fused itself to the windowsill. Matteo yanked it hard, and he was splashed with the icy, brown muck that remained of his once sweet, bitter coffee. Matteo lept back, but it was already too late; the cold liquid seeped through his thick pyjama top onto his chest and, like the cup and windowsill, his shirt stuck to his chest.

After living with insane throat, chest, and esophagus pain for weeks I got an upper GI done and found out I have a 3cm Hiatal Hernia that is keeping my LES open. Which explains why the acid has been seeping into my throat for several weeks now. They showed that the full esophagus is okay with no damage (thank goodness) but said I need to be on an high amount of Omeprazole 40mg 2x a day, and carafate 3 times a day for a month. 

Is there anything else that can help with symptoms? I have been following a GERD diet for a few weeks now, but my ENT had me on Pepcid for 3 weeks prior while waiting for the GI (which literally didn't do anything for me) so I only started the Omeprazole two days ago.  Do many people live normal lives with this? Anything that I should really know? I'm only 29 and I'm very scared about this. Relieved that we now know what this is, but scared what this means for my future. 

The GI doctor said that he has one too, and lives a normal life. I'm just really freaked out and want to know if this is something that can be lived with while on medication.

I am a 28-year-old female, and I am struggling with a lot of stuff but when I go to doctors or talk to others it feels like I am delusional so here is my story and be the judge to that. First, it all started in 2015, it was my first year in college I suddenly gained weight in a very short time (from 43kg to 61 kgs) in 3 months, it was unusual since our family is known for high metabolism and I have always been underweight since I eat healthily and exercise daily in the morning. Well, the weight wasn't an issue to me as it was for my mom since I am heavy-chested I was always considered fat to her, I am 157 cm. Anyway, this huge jump scared me so I went to doctors and nutrients but they thought I had an ED or body dysmorphia since 61 was a normal BMI and I used to be underweight, one doctor (nutrient) asked me to do a blood test which I did and said nothing is wrong. 

Fast forward to 2019 by now my weight has fluctuated from 52 to 61 over the past years and I would lose weight by stopping eating carbs and eating only egg soup or chicken, no cheese no cream no sugar, etc. In 2019 my father passed away suddenly and I got a chronic reaction afterward which was hives, I also had a weight jump in 2 months from 58 kgs to 81 kgs, my diet didn't change or my routine yes I was depressed but I ate the same and it was hard to eat literally our uncle would make us eat to not fall out since we were all sad. This time I went to the same nutrient who asked me to do the blood tests and talked to her and showed her my weight graph, she remembered I was the one who came to her before and asked me if had any blood tests recently, the most recent one was on 2018 and she noticed something and asked me to test my prolactin, I did but it was deemed not high by the lab but she was skeptical as it is considered high but not concerningly high, she also wanted me to start a protein-based diet with her but since I was on Accutane I asked her to start after I am done with it since I was scared it might harm my liver. 

She also asked to see an obgyn, which I did and since I started work at that time and had insurance I went to different ones and was dismissed as there were no concerns since my menstrual cycle was healthy and I never missed any month. Until one doctor said she would give me the pills but I should pay for them since my insurance would cover only if I had milk coming out of my breasts, and she also did a sonar to check if I had any cysts which I didn't and prescribed the pills for me. Since it was my final exams week I didn't take the pills right away fearing it would clash with my accutane or being sick so I waited until my final exams were over, in that time span my period that month didn't come and my body started retaining water and I was so moody and cranky it was weird, I went to the doctor and apparently my body was fake pregnant ( i was still a virgin at that time) and she said I should take the medication since this was caused by the prolactin and all this time my prolactin wasn't higher than what they deem as high. 

Once I took the pills, I got my period and I lost 17 cm from my waist. After that, I finished my accutane in April 2020 and started my diet since it was covid and I was working remotely. My diet were protein packs I got from my nutritionist, so the breakfast was a pack, snack, and lunch but for dinner I would eat any sort of protein with veggies, only 15 g of milk or cheese and I can drink coffee no suagrs, I lost 15 kg in 3 months so I was now 68 kgs (last thing I reached was in the 90s don't remember how much exactly) I was happy even though I just broken up at that time with my X and I was healthy or so I thought. 

I started having episodes of depression and my husband ( my new boyfriend at that time) asked me to go seek medical help, which I did and I was told I was severely depressed and was prescribed Prozac. Here started my problem again but this time it was my fault, I started eating like crazy, I would order from two restaurants at the same time and eat even when I was full and kept on eating, I was binging. I talked to my doctor but she kept on telling me to go to the gym also I was always sleepy and numb and since I work in a creative field this has impacted my work and I resigned at that time because I just wanted to sleep and eat. I stopped the pills and since I gained weight I started using Ozempic (with no medical consultant)and used the wrong dose ended in the ER and also got covid, at this time my willpower was zero since I gained everything and more and was depressed and quit work.

I sought another doctor who said the reason I binged was because of Prozac (Fluoxetine) it made me not depressed and hence eating but trust me I wasn't happy at all it made me worse. So the new doctor gave me citalopram and it worked on me, I never noticed the change but my husband said I was always crying and I changed after taking them (btw we were in a long-distance relationship at the time). Now I wanted to lose weight so I signed up in a new gym (9 rounds) and I would go to them before work, I didn't lose any weight, and I started intermittent fasting, but still no change. I cut off all the sugars and also started the same protein pack diet and still no weight difference, I signed up in another gym with a training coach for weight resistance, and also still no change in weight I would gain but not lose. 

My sister said I should get my thyroid checked, and the doctor asked me some questions and said there was nothing wrong, I went to another doctor my sister recommended since she worked with him (she's a resident) and he said the reason my weight never went down was actually from the medication I am taking (citalopram) and I should stop it and start cbt after the depression test if it was moderate, and he asked for an x-ray for my thyroid and some blood tests. At that time my depression was moderate and I was off the medication, also he said I should start taking Ozempic and eventually Monjaro ( which wasn't supplied at that time) since I have insulin resistance he also gave me folic acid vitamin B, and iron. 

I started it and started losing weight, but since Ozempic was getting a lot of attention I couldn't keep on getting them which made me take them some weeks and some not then I started from the least dose since my reaction to it was severe nausea and throwing up. That was all in 2022, I reached 99.7 kg and started losing weight by August 2023 I was 78 kgs, but after that, I got a kidney stone and the first day of ozempic and my IBS too which caused me to have fear from ozempic and Monjaro even now talking about it gives me nausea.

I stopped them all and started dieting and going to the gym doing cardio and weight resistance. I stayed 78 for a long time then I got married, after our honeymoon, I gained weight to 84 but it was understandable I was dieting then suddenly eating and not moving a lot. Now comes the problem since I got married I quit my second job and focused only on one that was remote, I started working out at home (weight resistance) and cooking our food while counting the calories, my husband lost weight but I didn't I would only gain, he was also puzzled with this I went to a GP and he said I should do some tests and said there is nothing wrong with me and my insulin resistance is good.

My husband read on reddit that inositol might help so I started it and now its been 4 months and no change, except my period changed it used to be 7-8 days now its 4-5, I started taking Berberine this month and cut sugar and carbs but not completely I would eat potatoes, beets, sweet potatoes etc, but under 1300 calories but I am still gaining and I am nearly back to 90. I honestly feel lost I am tired I've been dieting since 2015 and I wish I could eat normally as I used to before. I am honestly frustrated I want to start Mounjaro but can't handle the pain that comes with it and I am scared I feel I am losing my willpower I just want to feel healthy again and lose weight to be a normal weight I swear my knees would be the first ones to thank me, also being heavily chested and fat is a nightmare too.

I honestly want help, tell me what I could do I am open to all sorts of things. I am trying to walk 10k a day but can barely reach 6k I also started wearing a weight vest but I am not losing any weight I am just gaining. All our meals are homemade, I don't drink coffee or tea regularly but start it with diet since it makes me lose appetite, all our food is either cooked on a skillet or air fryer. I count all the things I use when I cook even the oil, spices, and water everything nothing goes not counted for. I hope I said everything and didn't miss anything.

I've had my BES870 (BBE) for around 7-8 years. For most of that time I always ""dialed in"" my espresso by looking at the pressure gauge and aimed at a little under 12 O'clock. Lately I've been taking a deeper dive into how espresso should be brewed and decided to start buying more fresh coffee and try dialing in by flow rate instead. So I have been weighing my dose (I usually start around 19-20g) and I time my shots and weight the output. I aim for a classic 1:2 ratio within 25-30 seconds of brew time (pre infusion included). I use that as the base and then adjust by taste. The trouble is that if I try dialing in by pressure - the flow rate is too fast (I get too much espresso in the given time) and if I dial in by flow-rate the pressure is too high ( at the very top of ""espresso range"" so around 12-14 bar). I'm a little reluctant to do the OPV mod because I've heard people running into issues with the steam pressure or brew temperature going up because of slowed flow and the dimmer mod has even worse outcomes. What is the general advice in this situation? The shots do seem to taste better if adjusted to flow rate, but they get worse when channeling occurs and the higher the pressure the bigger the chance of channeling so the shots that do work are good but some get ruined.",3,1729890365.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I'm a little afraid to post this, as I don't want to get torn to shreds, or called a bad owner. However, I want to understand what happened here.

So I have this 2 year old lab mix, and by all accounts, he's a sweetheart. Coffee shops love him, and know his name. People at the park love him. People on the street love him. He's my ""easy"" one, out of my three. So easy to train, and he loves toys, and just your typical ""dog"" things. 

Well, today we were at a caf√© that he's been to dozens of times before. They all know him, have watched him grow up, give him treats, etc. 

So this family walks in, and the younger boy is interested in my dog, but very clearly nervous around him. My dog sniffs, and wags his tail, and that's the end of it. I go back to reading because I'm by myself again. Then, a minute later the kid comes running in, directly to my dog, and they are face level, and my dog just barks his face off. Just those loud, agitated barks. There was zero contact. The kid freaks, runs out of the room, and the dad walks in telling me to get out.

I have no idea who this guy is, and he's getting extremely aggressive with me. I try telling him that my dog is really friendly, and something just surprised/ spooked him. He's having none of it, saying to ""get the f*** out or I'm calling thr police"". I say ""For what?"", and he claims my dog attacked his son. I said he didn't. That my dog just barked. He claimed my dog currently barking at him (the father), is proof that he's vicious, but now my dog is really agitated because this guy is sort of leering over me threateningly.

Anyway, I refused to leave (partly because I didn't really want to go outside with this guy), and I get the whole family calling me the C word, etc. Just a really awful situation. I leave 10 minutes later out of humiliation, and just to get him out of there.

So I'm wondering what happened? When I say this is the first time I've ever heard him bark at anyone, I mean it. He's so good natured, and plays with kids/ adults/ dogs all the time. I barely knew how to react because, again, I've never had to deal with this situation with him. He was even trying to get attention from the dad while he was telling me to leave. 

From my perspective, my dog got surprised and barked, but this guy made me feel like I was sitting at a caf√© with Cujo. Which I didn't feel was fair.",10,1729890279.0,DogAdvice,21,0.92,False

But I recently found this old espresso machine for next to nothing and fixed it up. Figured it would be a decent way to dip my toes in before investing in a nice machine.  

So I gave it a shot, but it doesn't seem to produce good espresso, there is no crema at all, it almost gives off drip coffee vibes (at least from my limited understanding of it all).  My best guess is there is no pressure building up at all.   Is it possible I just need a proper grinder instead of whatever $20 electric one I got off Amazon a couple years ago (I did set it to espresso grind size but it still seems large).  Would a proper tamp make a big difference in this scenario over a makeshift one?  Or is the machine just too old to hold up, and I should just jump in with a new one and get the whole setup?

I know many reply to the ‚Äúwhere will you go?‚Äù question with fun stuff like ‚Äúto the outdoors‚Äù or ‚Äúto grab a coffee‚Äù. But, emotionally and spiritually, I don‚Äôt feel like I have an answer to that. Closest I have is ‚Äúto my own connection with God‚Äù. But that feels so strained and tainted, still. I‚Äôve still got all the conditioning that tells me I‚Äôm not going to get that connection to God without this specific belief set, that I‚Äôm not going to be worthy of that peace and feeling of safety. 

I don‚Äôt know how to fix this, I guess. I‚Äôm okay with holding on to the practical stuff I feel like was worthwhile or good. I still value the idea of being spiritually-minded and trying to have a connection with God (who I still believe in). I‚Äôm even okay with the idea of being some generic, personal-relationship-driven Christian (I‚Äôll have maybe pick and choose and throw out all some of the predominant Christian narratives that tell me being gay isn‚Äôt okay, of course).

Is this just part of the process? How does the next phase happen? I feel like while some who join or grow up in the church have some conversion story or experience with some key, critical moment of confirmation/conversion, there‚Äôs almost a de-conversion equivalent of a shelf breaking. I can‚Äôt even envision what my metaphorical shelf would actually look like if it were real? Loaded? Broken but with a few books hanging by their shredded binding?

I just started with a new therapist recently and hope this will help me. But I know everything there is going to have to push up against the ingrained narratives from the church that still hold sway in how I see the world and myself. Can you actually move forward and honestly feel sure that you‚Äôre okay and feel confident that stuff is just fake and false and no longer important? What resources have helped you, here? I‚Äôve been on here mostly lurking for a long time. I‚Äôve heard Mormon Stories podcasts and stuff. I‚Äôm not a TBM here to say ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen it all and it made my faith stronger‚Äù, I‚Äôm here saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôve seen a lot, but somehow the desire to believe and cling to this, even as it hurts me, remains.

1. What I‚Äôm showing in the photos is ready to be applied to some plants in my backyard?
2. If not, is it suitable as pre-composted bedding for my worm bins?
3. If not, can someone please help me diagnose what I‚Äôm doing wrong and need to do differently.

I‚Äôve had this bin going for around a year, but I‚Äôve been very lazy with it, only really turned it once or twice. I was oxygenating it with a fan for most of that time but the fan recently died, and I don't know how useful that was anyway. I think the biggest issue is that it‚Äôs been too dry overall. The feedstocks have been a lot of yard waste, mostly leaves, a relatively small amount of kitchen waste, some spent grain from a local brewery, and a good amount of spent grounds from Starbucks (which makes me unsure how finished this is, since coffee grounds look a like compost to begin with). It got up to temp (\~140¬∞F) for quite a while but has been back down to \~80-90¬∞ recently, maybe 10-30¬∞ above ambient temperature. It's crawling with earwigs, and a handful of worms and isopods too.

This is the result of sifting with 1/4‚Äù mesh. It doesn‚Äôt look nearly as beautiful as a lot of what I see people post on this sub. Do I just need to screen it finer, is it not finished yet, or am I doing something completely wrong?

Well, jury duty got canceled, but then I got pinkeye. It's just been a week full of fun, y'all. Still, I had some time on my hands today, and I decided to review the second adventure in¬†*Hope Reborn.*¬†This adventure,¬†*Real Estate Rumble,*¬†focuses on investigating the nefarious villains targeting debonair real estate mogul Jack Skorkowsky.

SPOILER WARNING. Obviously, we're going to be reviewing the scenario, and that means you might be spoiled for both this scenario and others in the book. You have been warned.

We're going to break this review into three pieces: What the adventure is about (both thematically and plot-wise), what are the adventure's weak spots, and how might we address them.

I'm probably going to repeat this during each review, even though I don't think I need to include it for most of the community. Any criticisms made here are leveled with the intent of letting the designers improve. Please do not harass anyone based on this review, or try to get people fired, or run off at the mouth about how anyone needs to kill themselves.

If you are thinking about any of these actions all I can say is: Dude. Don't be a dick.

**Summary:**

With the Forlorn Hope destroyed, Marianne wants to rebuild it. She sends the PCs to work with Jack Skorkowsky, a real estate agent of some notoriety and absolutely *fabulous* dress sense.

[The very embodiment of style over substance, ladies and gentlemen](https://preview.redd.it/0td9gafstxwd1.png?width=991&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0204f7610834dbec23fb4ccffcf790814dea4aa)

Marianne's paying 500 eb per PC, but Jack's got some issues of his own, and he asks the PCs to give him a hand while he works something out for the Freemans. He'll pay them 500 eb to help him, so the PCs can make out a fair payday here.

The problem he's specifically having is that one of his construction sites appears to be haunted - the work crew has been harassed with weird noises and a run of nasty accidents before they showed up this morning and found the door covered in blood. Like sensible people, the work crew refused to continue working the job.

Now Jack's asking the PCs to investigate so he can restart construction. Turns out, Jack's being targeted by a Bozo troupe called the Cirqu3 d3 B0z0, who want to drive him nuts. They've turned the ""haunted"" construction into a death trap, riddled with remote-activated traps and bombs.

The actual death house construction is well done. The map and key are clean and easy to read, and the traps themselves feel both thematically and mechanically sound. The design is impressively robust, forcing the PCs to juggle multiple problems at the same time, with a nice degree of time pressure on the PCs. There probably doesn't need to be as much verbiage as there is on the page, but it's clear the designers are trying to err on the side of giving the GM more information than they need, not less. I can excuse a lot of words for someone trying to help me out.

This is, in short, quite well done!

After this, the PCs get a day or so of downtime, and then get caught up helping Jack again. He's paying them 500 eb each. This time, some jerks blew a hole in the wall of a garage / apartment Jack owns, and started raiding it! The Crew shows up, only to discover that the jerks in question didn't blow that hole in the wall - someone given to bad rhymes did (there were a ton of bad rhymes at the death house, too, making a nice point of narrative continuity). There's some investigation to be done at Kasim's (a Turkish coffee bar from the *Data Pack)* and then the PCs' move onto the finale.

Jack's found a place for the Hope, but as he's showing it to the PCs, a bouquet of grenades starts counting down. Once it goes off, Bozos show up across the street and steal the expensive GRAF3 construction drone, running away with it in a screaming chase. The PCs can get the drone back, tripling their second payout from Jack, or if they fail, he still pays them what was owed from the garage investigation. No matter what, Marianne gets the PCs the 500 eb she promised.

Before I get into pitfalls, there are a few things I want to unreservedly praise:

* The designers are not precious about how this can go down. In a sidebar called ""Players Always Surprise You,"" they elaborate on various ways PCs can upend the expected order of events, and provide crucial guidance to GMs on how to handle some of these. ***This is fantastic support for new GMs and good on the writers and Mr. Gray for providing it.***
* The final ""bomb"" is a well-executed subversion of the themes highlighted in the scenario.
* There's a toy GRAF3 drone at the death house that provides a brilliant clue to the final chase - bravo to the authors on that one.
* The authors provide bad poetry for the villain to shout at the PCs - very nice to see that included as support for GMs who may not want to make up rhyming couplets on the fly.

[Cue the horror strings](https://preview.redd.it/jr3cblj8pywd1.png?width=374&format=png&auto=webp&s=72ae680c36e0df1be2256e015babea6af84fd740)

**Pitfalls:**

This scenario is quite well done. The largest problem I have with it is that it's an investigation scenario where the PCs are almost totally passive. The Beat Chart for this thing is almost exclusively one straight line, with only a couple choices the PCs can make. This reminds me of *Night At The Opera*, actually. The good news is that the drivers of the action are entirely external to the PCs, so the scenario can't stall out.

However, that also means the PCs don't really feel like they're at the center of the stage - they're almost peripheral, and never really make their own decisions about the next thing to do. They are reacting, never acting.

They are told to investigate the ""haunted house,"" but all they can find is, ""It was Bozos!"" I would have preferred some way for the PCs to move the action forward on their own. While the broader revelation beats of:

* The Bozos are involved
* The Bozos are targeting Jack
* The Bozos are trying to drive Jack nuts

all *land*, they don't feel as earned as they could have if the PCs had been the ones uncovering and driving that action forward.

There is one specific critique that I do need to make. To preface, this might be answered elsewhere in the adventure and I'm just missing it. However, as written, I'm not sure what the PCs are supposed to be driving when they chase the Bozos at the end of the adventure. The adventure pre-supposes they have wheels, but I don't see anything provided, and there's no statblock for a vehicle that the PCs are supposed to be driving at the end of the adventure.

EDIT: Shout out to u/Drew-cipher for pointing out that there are stats for the ""Forlorn Hope Van"" on page 61 of the book, at the end of this adventure. It's mentioned the PCs can borrow it on p 43 of the book. That's my bad, and thanks to Drew (and the writers!) for covering this base. 

~~Ultimately, only the car is potentially scenario-breaking here, but it's easy to fix on the fly. Just have Jack drive the PCs, and don't worry so much about the chase mechanics.~~ While the scenario as a whole is more linear than I'd like, it's still written well enough that I can modify basically the entire structure with minimal effort.

**Editing:**

In order to create room for the PCs to act, I'd swap out the linear framework for a [node-based framework.](https://thealexandrian.net/wordpress/7949/roleplaying-games/node-based-scenario-design-part-1-the-plotted-approach) Leave the initial setup and the haunted house, as those are golden. However, I'd include the following clues:

|Room|Clue|Leads To|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Lobby|Crumpled scrap of paper, with an address (the garage), and a date and time (tomorrow, 10 pm). **Automatically found.**|The Garage|
|Cubicle Farm|A partially-waterlogged photo of a building, including a construction lot with a GRAF3. Jack can ID the neighborhood as Woodland Park. The GRAF3 is circled in red marker. **Automatically found.**|Woodland Park|
|Break Room|Dead body, exsanguinated for the blood on the door. Clearly a Bozo, has a hideous costume. **Local Expert (any Night City), DV 17:** the costume is from an abandoned Netrunner bar, Cirque du Slay, found in Pacifica.|Cirqu3 d3 B0z0 Hideout|
|Bathroom|Dropped Agent. **Electronics / Security Tech check DV 17:** bomb location at the garage, time of detonation (tomorrow, 10 pm), and a text alerting a journalist, Destiny Hondel, to ""something interesting"" happening tomorrow at 10 pm. Failing the check causes the Agent to wipe all memory.|The Garage|
|Hallway|**Electronics / Security Tech check DV 19, or Interface DV 10:** The toy GRAF3 drone has a file in its databanks, left there accidentally by Sp00ph, on Jack Skorkowsky's schedule.|Woodland Park|
|Main Office|The bomb's materials, including the plaster and drywall, all have branding for ""David French Construction."" **Library Search, DV 15:** The only building this company built before going under was a now-abandoned Netrunner bar: Cirque du Slay, found in Pacifica.|Cirqu3 d3 B0z0 Hideout|

Each of these clues should point the PCs toward the next things that are occurring, as well as letting them choose how they want to push forward. What the PC's don't know is that the GRAF3 clues are an intentional misdirect, left behind by Sp00ph (the leader of the Cirqu3 d3 B0z0), to trick Jack into thinking the Bozo's are after his drone. Instead, they're after *Jack.*

If the PCs decide to go after the Bozos in their lair, they catch Sp00ph flat-footed at the abandoned Netrunner bar, Cirque du Slay, located in Pacifica Playground.

[Cirque du Slay Interior, map credit to Moonbow Vineyards](https://preview.redd.it/mict3bvbnywd1.png?width=794&format=png&auto=webp&s=a0308ad21d97ecf92f6e50e2c5c57feb93a7a183)

Sp00ph has six **Cirqu3 d3 B0z0 clowns** (see end of adventure for statblock) and three Large Air Drones equipped with VH Pistols and AP rounds. Sp00ph has four fragmentation grenades, but each one has a 1-in-6 chance of failing to detonate when he throws them. Sp00ph and the Bozos don't retreat, and have no regard for their own well-being.

The only other edit I'd make is that the Bozo's don't want the drone, they want Jack. If the PCs don't deal with Sp00ph at Cirque du Slay, he'll catch up with Jack at Woodland Park. While the PCs are dealing with the the Bomb-bastic Bouquet beat, the Bozos hurl sleep grenades at them. These grenades have a higher DV to resist (DV 15), but only last for 30 seconds. The Bozos (equipped with nasal filters) grab Jack, grab the truck, and are peeling out of the lot as the PCs regain consciousness.

The PCs can grab Jack's car (a Quadro Turbo-R 740; stats as **high performance groundcar;** he has a second set of keys in the driver's side visor) to pursue them. Run the chase as described.

**Conclusion:**

I won't bury the lede here: this is leaps-and-bounds better than some of what we saw in *Street Stories*. It shows effort, dedication, and focus from the team. Deciding to put what is effectively a puzzle dungeon into a *Cyberpunk* product also showcases how far you can push the system, and the kinds of things you can do with it. Seriously, reading this made me want to grab *Tomb of Horrors* and see if I could convert that over.

8.0 as written. 9.0 if you rework the structure and change the Bozo's ultimate target. This is a good job.",7,1729888298.0,cyberpunkred,4,1.0,False

Initially, Jen, the PTA president, was supportive, but things have stalled since.

Jen raised concerns about the proposal, so I made adjustments and put together a more detailed presentation to present to the group. Despite addressing her concerns, she wouldn‚Äôt let me present it during PTA meetings, insisting we needed further discussions. But these discussions kept getting delayed, leading to weeks long delays. She also wouldn‚Äôt commit to a meeting to discuss the proposal with the executive group, only stating she was busy without specifying when she would be available.

At PTA meetings, Jen‚Äôs time management with the one hour meetings only led to 20 minutes of agenda with no time for proposals or feedback.  To move things forward, I scheduled a 1:1 coffee meeting with her to understand her working style and collaborate better. She cancelled twice‚Äîthe first time due to her being tired. After the second cancellation, I suggested we meet for 20 minutes since she was nearby. She declined, saying we could meet during a public event she was working the next day but at no specific time. I responded saying the next day is fine but that ‚Äú... I'm depending on you‚Äîplease let‚Äôs not reschedule again.‚Äù

Jen became defensive, saying she had ‚Äúgraciously set aside time‚Äù but couldn‚Äôt make it due to disruptions that wer not her fault. When I said it felt like I was jumping through hoops and  roadblocked, she responded that the accusation was ‚Äúwholly inaccurate and harmful‚Äù and said she would ‚Äúnip that (my response) in the bud.‚Äù She also said I needed to respect boundaries, which was frustrating since I had adjusted to multiple cancellations.

I found it hard to believe we couldn‚Äôt find 20 minutes for a discussion over a month. I had spent time preparing a  proposal and lined up possible speakers, so I felt I‚Äôd been responsive. Even when I approached her at the playground, where we‚Äôd watch our kids for 30 minutes or more, she didn‚Äôt want to talk there, avoiding the topic altogether.

I understand not wanting to meet in certain circumstances if she weren‚Äôt the PTA president, but given her role and my attempts to discuss the proposal, I felt a small discussion over 4 weeks was reasonable.

AITA for pleading not to be cancelled on again, or should I have backed off?  I honestly don't know what else to do move things forward.",5,1729888249.0,AmItheAsshole,69,0.66,False

1gc3tlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1gc3tlv/ill_just_going_to_let_it_be/,I‚Äôll just going to let it be,"Hi babe, 

It‚Äôs been a while since I actually felt like myself. And I wanted to share some things with you while the clarity is still here. 

I have been going to therapy every week, religiously. Most of the time I cry for a whole hour and then I‚Äôm in pain the rest of the week. The truth is that I‚Äôm still in pain and this hurts so bad. Losing you was a catalyst that activated all my past wounds, even the ones I thought were healed.

I have learn a few things; and acknowledge a few others 

1. I have a secure attachment style. Not because I was born with it, but because I HEALED from my previous one.  I‚Äôm extremely proud of this. I do feel a little special about this, I feel like a delicacy and I think you missed out on me. 

2. I suffered neglect and abandonment when I was a child, and apparently that‚Äôs a trauma that needs to be healed, the reason why I needed space from us was because because of your attachment style, all my wounds got reopened. (Big thanks, I do mean it, I‚Äôm not being sarcastic, thanks because without you, I would have never seen it and decided it to heal it no matter what)

3. I love you, and I don‚Äôt know when I‚Äôm going to stop loving you, and that‚Äôs ok. I might love you forever, I might love you until tomorrow, I don‚Äôt know. And I will stop forcing myself to stop loving you and stop missing you. I will just let it be and I understand that I am love and I can‚Äôt delete you from my system. I‚Äôll just let it run its course. I love you and I wish you the best with all my heart and soul. I LOVE YOU, YOU STUPID IDIOT 

4. I think you will come back, or maybe I will be the one contacting you whenever I‚Äôm ready, this used to make me anxious. The reason why I think you will come back is because we talked about coffee, being friends, loving each other and maybe reconnecting in the future. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, if you haven‚Äôt done the work on yourself I don‚Äôt think we will be good for each other, and I refuse to put my heart through the same heartbreak, and I refuse to make you go through the same pain again (duh, I love you) BUT, whenever you come back, my arms are open, not to go back to the relationship, that relationship died, but to my space. I don‚Äôt hold any grudges against you, and I will always treat you with love and respect. If you want to talk, I‚Äôll be there. WHEN we get there, IF we get there, then I‚Äôll decide what‚Äôs best for me. But please know that you‚Äôre loved and welcomed. You‚Äôre safe around me. 
In my level of healing today, I can still say that I won‚Äôt be contacting you at all, but I don‚Äôt know if whenever I heal I‚Äôll do it, so I won‚Äôt force myself in a decision when I‚Äôm about to change my world. 

5. Dating other people is not my priority right now. And not just because I love you, but because this time I‚Äôm working on loving myself. I tend to lose myself in my relationships, so this time I‚Äôll find myself. Whenever I‚Äôll ready, I‚Äôll start dating with no remorse. After all, we‚Äôre not together, I don‚Äôt owe you anything. By your choice. 

6. The most beautiful thing in my therapy session today is that I need to rewrite my brain, every time I do something for myself I‚Äôll repeat the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm loving myself‚Äù 

Example:

Brush my teeth? Loving myself
Going to the gym? Loving myself
Working? Loving myself
Loving you? That‚Äôs ok, I‚Äôll show patience and compassion to myself, why? Because I‚Äôm loving myself. 

So from now on, my goal will be to love myself. 

Oh and I lost 15 pounds lmao. I‚Äôm planning to lose 15 more. 

That‚Äôs all amor, I just wanted to let you know that I hold no grudges, that I love you and I miss you, that I am NOT waiting for you but if you come back, I‚Äôll respect you and treat you with respect, that I will start dating one day, it could me in months or in 10 years lmao, and lastly, that I‚Äôm loving myself first. 

Thank you for this wonderful year, I was so incredibly happy, so was Vero.

Ps. Yes. I am open to start a NEW relationship with the healed version of ourselves, but ultimately, I‚Äôll do what‚Äôs best for me, so I won‚Äôt be waiting for you, you might never come back to my knowledge. 

I love you, bye G ‚ù§Ô∏è",3,1729887859.0,UnsentLetters,3,0.72,False
1gc3tel,https://www.reddit.com/r/hospice/comments/1gc3tel/my_mothers_death_from_ovarian_cancera_hospice/,My mother‚Äôs death from ovarian cancer-a hospice timeline ,"For context, my mom, 74 at death, was diagnosed with stage 3 ovarian cancer in May 2022. She underwent six months of chemotherapy and a debulking surgery, and enjoyed nearly 8 months of remission. In early 2024 her cancer came back, and she had been undergoing a second round of chemotherapy. Unfortunately, this round was not effective in controlling her cancer, and she began to experience weight loss and severe constipation.  
She would be admitted to the ER 29 days before her eventual death, for severe stomach pain and uncontrollable vomiting. This will begin the timeline of my mother‚Äôs experience with dying-she passed away yesterday. In doing lots of research, I learned that people with cancer tend to ‚Äújump the cliff‚Äùquickly-and boy, were they right. I hope someone else can learn from my experience.

29 days before death-admitted to ER for uncontrollable pain and vomiting. Immediately put on Iv fluids and nourishment as she is cachexic. 

27 days-finally diagnosed with severe bowel impaction while in the hospital. Labs show her ca125 markers are increasing, and her ascites is growing. However, because of her bowel impaction she is not able to safely have ascites drained. She does receive an enema and makes a small amount of BM.

25 days-mom finally BMs on her own, but is now telling everyone that she is dying. She is eating again. The hospital wants to release her after she makes one more BM, and is counseled on her options-more aggressive therapy , skilled nursing, or hospice. Mom wants hospice but due to family pressure, eventually chooses skilled nursing.

21 days-mom is finally released from the hospital, and transferred to skilled nursing. Complains of severe pain during the transport.

20 days-refuses to do PT at the SNF, saying she‚Äôs in too much pain.  Doctor officially starts her on 5mg oxycodone.

19 days-mom calls everyone, crying that she wants to go to hospice and die at home. We discharge her from the SNF, and she is brought home to begin hospice. At this point she is still eating and drinking, but not a lot. Starting to get confused about small things, and still constantly in pain. 

17 days-mom‚Äôs confusion is getting worse. She forgets how to make coffee and becomes hysterical about it. Keeps repeating that she IS dying soon, ‚Äúhopefully real soon‚Äù. 

16 days-severe stomach pain and vomiting kick in again. Doctor prescribes Zofran which helps, but mom begins experiencing excruciating heartburn.  Prilosec is prescribed, but mom won‚Äôt take it.

14 days-mom has diarrhea, which relieves some of her pain from constipation. Mentions her belly is growing and getting hard from ascites. Calls doc and says 5mg of oxy isn‚Äôt enough, so he ups it to 10mg. Heartburn increases, mom is eating only 4-5 bites of food at a time. 

13 days-mom complains that she‚Äôs getting excessive secretions in her mouth and throat. Atropine is prescribed. Confusion continues to get worse, she is now struggling to use her phone and again, getting extremely upset about it. Tells me she wishes the death process would ‚Äúhurry up‚Äù. In the meantime, she‚Äôs been doing hours and hours of life review. 

10 days until death-begins a 5 day marathon of making phone calls, FaceTime calls, etc to everyone and anyone she ever cared for, telling everyone she wears dying. Her appetite is getting worse but still manages to eat here and there. Later that night she wets herself. 

9 days-says 10mg of oxy isn‚Äôt helping anymore, doc raises to 15mg. She complains to me that she ‚Äúwants the good drugs‚Äù,  but hospice says that‚Äôs only for actively dying. She is having small bowel movements, and is starting to develop mottling on her feet and calves. Still eating 2-3 bites at a time. 

7 days before death-confusion and pain continue to increase, she is not getting confused about people and where they are. Agitation is at an all-time high, and while she is given Ativan regularly, a liquid THC shows to be more effective at getting her to relax.

6 days before death-calls her doc and begs for morphine. Starts telling people she is ‚Äúover‚Äù this life.  Doc finally approves morphine, .25mg every 4 hours. 

5 days before death (the jump off the cliff)-while trying to walk to the bathroom, mom falls on the floor and can‚Äôt get up. She has become so weak, even moving her limbs requires too much energy. We get her back into bed, where she asks for more morphine half hour after her dose. We call and the doc allows an increase to .5mg every 4 hours.

4 days before death-mom has suddenly lost the ability to talk except for ‚Äúyes‚Äù or ‚Äúno‚Äù. Is trying to move on her own, but grimaces in pain with every movement.  A nurse comes and assesses and says since isn‚Äôt completely bed bound yet, we don‚Äôt need a hospital bed. Later that night, mom cries out in pain so much when she sits up.  This is the last day mom eats anything, 3 bites of jello in the morning. By night we are calling hospice again, and they say they will indeed deliver a hospital bed.

3 days before death-mom wakes up every 2 hours crying in agony, so doc okays an increase to morphine every 2 hours. She is now completely unable to communicate. Hospital bed arrives, mom is bathed and changed before being placed in the bed, where she will spend her final 48 hours. 

2 days before death-mom is now sleeping most of the time, but still waking up occasionally in pain. Around noon, she begins to projectile vomit green bile. Nurse comes and assesses, and says that because she can still nod her head she is NOT actively dying. He prescribes an extended release morphine pill,  we tell him mom is starting to have problems with swallowing. He says try with applesauce.

1 day before death-mom has soiled the bed during her sleep. She is completely unconscious at this point, unable to open her eyes. She has her final drink, a syringe of protein drink given by her well-meaning house cleaner. Grimaces in pain occasionally. 12 hours after cleaning her up from her morning bodily fluid release, we notice she hasn‚Äôt urinated in her diaper at all.  A few hours later, her diaper has some slight tea-colored urine. Mom develops a terminal fever, we place cool cloths on her. Her breathing is starting to become fast and shallow, like hyperventilating. Eventually, she begins to moan loudly on every exhale.
At 10 pm, I give her a final dose of morphine and Ativan. I‚Äôm trying not to sleep, but my body can‚Äôt fight. As I‚Äôm falling asleep, mom starts making the death rattle.

Day of death-at 3:30am, my father overhears mom ‚Äúcoughing‚Äù, and says he held her hand until she stopped, telling her he loved her. When I wake up at 8am, I look over and see mom‚Äùs chest isn‚Äôt moving. When I walk over, I see that she has vomited a brownish substance, which still lingers in her mouth. She is cold, her eyes are closed, but she is gone. A nurse comes by half hour later, and confirms mom‚Äùs passing. She has released her bodily fluids, we clean her up and dress her before she is taken away forever. ",7,1729887845.0,hospice,2,0.9,False

The Ball

¬†

Maxwell and company circulated through the ball, meeting almost every noble in attendance, then separated to talk more intimately with different groups. Grendel, for his part, stayed quiet as he followed Brianna and took mental notes. *Polite hello, small talk, deeper questions with a give and take of information, polite goodbye. Don‚Äôt actively argue, just a polite comment of differing opinion. Actively listen to what each mark is saying, then repeat with a questioning tone in order to get more clarification and deeper meanings. Mo‚Ä¶Bri is brilliant on so many levels. I‚Äôm glad Max told me to follow her and pay attention to How she says things as opposed to what she‚Äôs saying.*

His musings were interrupted by an older man staring at him expectantly. ‚ÄúUm, I‚Äôm sorry sir, I was lost in thought about‚Ä¶the architecture?‚Äù

‚ÄúArchitecture. Yes. It is surely grand.‚Äù The older man quirked an eyebrow. ‚ÄúI *had* asked you to get me a flute of wine, but I see you are much too busy admiring the ‚ÄúArchitecture‚Äù of Lady Brianna.‚Äù

Grendel‚Äôs face turned red, and his mouth went dry. ‚ÄúHuh? Wait, WHAT!?!‚Äù He stared at the man. ‚ÄúYou think I was ogling Lady Bri like she was some sort of STREET TART?!?‚Äù His face turned a black cherry red as anger started to course through his veins. He reached to his belt and slowly withdrew a pair of soft leather riding gloves, and threw one in the man‚Äôs face, before saying quite loudly, ‚ÄúI believe I will be needing a sword.‚Äù

\-

Across the ballroom, max heard the word ‚ÄúSword‚Äù, and looked up from the small plate of cookies he was devouring. He slowly scanned the room until his eyes fell upon a slowly expanding circle that was centered on Grendel and an older man. ‚ÄúShit.‚Äù

\-

‚ÄúSir, you have insulted me and profaned my Lady.‚Äù Grendel growled out. ‚ÄúI will not leave this insult unanswered. Arm yourself, cur, or be cut down.‚Äù He took two steps to the side and yanked an antique sword from the wall. As he pointed the curved blade at his opponent and sighted down its length, the weapon started to glow.

The man stared at Grendel, then at the sword, then back to Grendel, and fainted.

Grendel glanced around at the circle that had formed, ‚ÄúDoes this man have a second?‚Äù He growled out. The circle of people, as one, stepped back.

Grendel made quite the stir last night. It‚Äôs not every day you see one of the ruling classes felled by an angry youth without a single blow being struck. He has entrenched himself as someone who is not to be trifled with, but the political fallout will cause problems down the road, I am certain.

For our part, Bri and I have made a few connections with the upper class, that should help smooth over the reconstruction of the docks. I would include the slums, but aside from the children, there aren‚Äôt any more poor people, and the children have been taken in by more well to do families.

I wonder how long it will take for people to realize that they needed the workforce the slums represented as they won‚Äôt want to do the ‚Äúlow class‚Äù jobs. I can already see the garbage starting to pile up in the alleys.

My research, with the assistance of people who are much better than I, has not produced much. The script is of the Elder Gods, and as such translation is slow going. We have translated a binding spell completely, and that is it. Those in the field are constantly bringing back more information to study.

Last night four more people died of ‚Äústrangulation‚Äù. There were no witnesses. The watch has no leads.

‚Ä¶I have a theory, but it would need tests, and I don‚Äôt know how to test it without the risk of someone dying‚Ä¶

38^(th) of Anael

The cruise ship has departed. They have places to go and cargo to transport. We gathered the last of our things, said goodbye to our traveling companions, and had a last supper at the captain‚Äôs table.

Two more have died, this time in the more affluent neighborhoods. Still no leads.

I need to test my theory.

Maxwell walked into The Library early, well before the staff was even thinking about coffee, and looked at the pile of books. His eye caught on a small volume that had been placed on the direct center of the table. It was new.

He stared for a moment, before picking the volume up and flipping through the crisp pages, and his nose smelled the scent of fresh ink and new paper. Then he looked at the words.

As his eyes bulged, he screamed at the top of his lungs. A few minutes of deep breathing later, he began writing at a furious pace, while muttering to himself, ‚Äúshit, shit, shit.‚Äù

So lets have a little chat about mental health.

I think I have made no effort to hide my mental health problems in the past, but let's discuss them once again...no, lets not, I don't feel like sounding like a whiner.¬†

The spring and fall seem to be the worst times for me as far as mental health goes. The change of seasons, or Transitions as they are called, trigger something in a lot of people and cause depression symptoms in otherwise balanced people. As someone who isn't ""Balanced"" things are worse for me. What helps me get by in the fall is getting outside and touching dirt, be that walking the garden at a friends, playing with AHG's horses, or my favorite, hunting. The other thing that seems to help is my weekly therapy session; beleive it or not, when you pay someone to listen to your problems and secrets, they actually listen to, and keep your secrets!!! And most of the time, insurance covers it!!!!!!!!!

Anyway, what I'm trying to say is that I haven't been great at updating due to mental health, and I'm trying to work on it.¬†

In other news, Mom Listen has had an almost full recovery from the knife severing the tendon in her foot, and will be out of physical therapy in a couple more weeks.

In the bad news, my bestest cat Raven Corvid the Third has a urinary tract infection and is in pain. He is on antibiotics, pain killers, and a special diet and a full recovery is expected.

Don't self delete. Dark humor can be soothing (I suggest the 80's movie Better Off Dead - ""Damn shame when folks be thrown away A perfectly good white boy like that.""  
), Toaster Bath isn't a good way to go out. For you veterans out there, Don't give in to the 22 a day. Hug your parent of choice (if possible). Touch the grass before the snow flies. Live life.

Would love to meet new people & find friends to hang out, do activities, chat about our feelings, and build genuine connections.

I'm introverted, can be a bit shy at first but I try my best. I tend to prefer socializing in a small group or 1 on 1 as I find large groups overwhelming.

I love running both trail & road. Just wrapped up my trail season (forests and mountains are my happy place), and will be training for a road running goal this winter to switch things up. Would like to get into the gym, but currently mostly just dumbbells at home to iron out form etc, and gyms are scary (wouldn't mind some tips). 

I'm a concept artist for video games, though I don't play games much these days. I might try the new Dragon Age. Some games I've really enjoyed are Dark Souls (have to say my fave is still 1), Persona 5, Final Fantasy 12, Animal Crossing New Horizons.

Other hobbies include reading (trying to get back into it more), journaling while chilling at a cafe, plants, nail polish (I can paint your nails if you want haha). I start shows often but rarely finish them - anything from K-dramas to sports docuseries. Constant long form YouTube content in the background (always looking for more btw). Open to volunteer opportunities - I've done some volunteering at races and really enjoyed it, and definitely plan to do more.

If anyone wants to meet up for coffee or a walk and just chat, let me know! I would love to hear about your hobbies and interests, if there's anything you're struggling with or working on, etc. :)",8,1729887112.0,Vancouver4Friends,9,0.91,False
