## Alternatives to MSR​ Aquatabs: Exploring Other Options

while⁢ MSR⁢ Aquatabs are a popular choice, several other water purification methods are available, each with it's own set of advantages and disadvantages. Understanding these alternatives can help you⁢ choose ⁣the best solution for your specific⁢ needs.

### Water ⁤Purification Drops

Similar⁢ to tablets, water purification drops use chlorine or chlorine dioxide to⁤ disinfect water. Examples include⁤ Potable Aqua ‌(iodine-based) and aquamira (chlorine ⁤dioxide).

*   **Pros:** Often⁣ more effective against Cryptosporidium than chlorine-based tablets. Can be easier to measure precise dosages.
*   **Cons:** Can have a stronger taste than chlorine tablets.⁢ May require a two-part ‍mixing process. Can be more expensive than tablets.

### Water Filters

Water filters physically remove bacteria,protozoa,and sediment from water. filters come in various ⁢forms, ⁢including pump‌ filters, ⁢gravity filters, and ‌filter⁣ bottles.

*   **Pros:** removes a wide ​range of contaminants,⁢ including bacteria, protozoa,⁣ and sediment. No waiting time required (for⁢ most filters). Can improve the ⁤taste of ⁤water.
* ⁤  **Cons:** Can be heavier​ and bulkier than tablets or⁢ drops.Requires‌ more effort to use (pumping​ or⁣ filling). Filters can clog and require cleaning or​ replacement.

### UV Water⁤ Purifiers

UV water purifiers use ultraviolet light to kill ​bacteria and viruses. These devices are typically small and battery-powered.*   **Pros:** No chemicals are added to the ​water. Fast treatment time. Can⁢ be effective against a wide range of pathogens.
*‌   **Cons:**⁣ requires batteries. Ineffective against​ protozoa ‍like Giardia ‌and Cryptosporidium unless water is pre-filtered. Requires clear water to be effective. Can be more expensive than other methods.

### Boiling Water

Boiling water for one minute (or three minutes at higher altitudes) is a reliable way to kill bacteria ⁣and viruses.

* ‍ ⁤ **Pros:** No chemicals are added to the water. Effective against ‌a wide range ‌of ‌pathogens.
*   **Cons:** Requires a ⁢heat source and cooking pot. Not always ⁤practical in all⁤ situations. Uses⁢ fuel.

### Comparing MSR Aquatabs to Chlorine Dioxide Tablets

A common question⁢ is ""Aquatabs vs​ chlorine dioxide?"" Chlorine dioxide tablets, like Aquamira, are often considered ⁤a superior alternative due to their effectiveness⁣ against Cryptosporidium. However,they may ​have a stronger taste and require a slightly ​more complex mixing procedure. Ultimately,​ the⁢ best choice depends on​ your specific needs ​and preferences. Some feel chlorine dioxide tablets are the best water purification tablets.

## Real-world Scenarios: choosing the⁣ Right Method

To illustrate the decision-making process, ⁤let's consider ⁣a few real-world ​scenarios:

*⁢   ⁢**Scenario 1: Solo ‍Thru-Hike** - ​A solo thru-hiker prioritizing ultra lightweight gear might choose MSR Aquatabs for their minimal weight and ease⁤ of use, understanding the risk‍ of ⁣Cryptosporidium and taking precautions to avoid​ potentially contaminated ⁢water‍ sources.
*   **Scenario 2: ​Family Camping trip** - A family camping trip near a known ⁤source‌ of Cryptosporidium might opt for a water filter or ⁢chlorine​ dioxide⁢ drops to ensure maximum protection⁤ for everyone.
*   **Scenario 3: International Travel to⁢ a‍ Developing Country** - A traveler heading to a developing country with questionable water quality might choose a combination ⁤of ⁣MSR Aquatabs and a portable⁣ water‍ filter for redundancy ⁤and broader protection.
*  ​ **Scenario 4: Emergency⁢ Preparedness Kit** - Stocking an emergency preparedness kit will often include multiple ⁢options for ‌water purification, including water purification tablets such as MSR Aquatabs due to their ​long ⁣shelf life.[[Explore Top Rated msr aquatabs on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/sawyer-mini/?kw=msr aquatabs)
## Where ​to Buy Aquatabs

MSR Aquatabs are widely‍ available at outdoor retailers, pharmacies, ⁣and online stores. Here‍ are‌ some common places to purchase aquatabs:

## Tips for Maximizing the Effectiveness of Water purification Tablets

*   **Pre-Filter water:** Always pre-filter water, especially if it is⁢ indeed murky or contains sediment.
*   **Follow⁢ Dosage Instructions:** Carefully⁤ read ⁣and follow ⁢the dosage ⁤instructions on the packaging. Using too few tablets will not effectively disinfect the water, while using too‍ many could ⁢create excessive chlorine levels.
*   **Allow Sufficient Contact Time:** Ensure the tablets⁤ have ​enough time to ‍dissolve completely and disinfect the​ water. Do⁢ not shorten the recommended⁣ contact time.
*   **Store Properly:** Store MSR Aquatabs‍ in a cool,‍ dry place ‍away from direct sunlight to maximize their⁢ shelf life.
*  ⁤ **Check Expiration Date:** Always⁢ check the expiration date before using MSR⁣ Aquatabs. Expired tablets may not be as‌ effective. The msr aquatabs​ expiration date is a critical element to check.
*   **Understand Limitations:** Be⁣ aware‍ that MSR Aquatabs are not effective against all pathogens, particularly Cryptosporidium. Consider alternative methods ⁣if this parasite is a concern.

And yes, every read is a victory, especially for a niche author. But it's not enough to buy a coffee. It's not enough to cover an ISBN.

First time posting, just wanted to get some honest advice. Started a coffee tumbler brand (rebranded after failing a ceramics brand). We are also in coffee shops in the local area and are having a positive positive response. We are struggling on our online sales with only a 0.2 - 0.5% conversion rate.

We recently were penalised by google a few months back for poor performance scores (too high LCP) and lost all organic traffic. This has now been fixed but we are struggling to reach the same sort of numbers.

We ran google ads - not able to capitalise on a single sale and did not have good engagement.

Recently have tried TikTok and Instagram ads about $10 budget per day - currently testing at different times and ads but so far a lot more engagement, we've had 1 sale and 1/10 people are having a good look around the website.

We also have recently started blog post on low competition high traffic pages. Our website has an updated look and has unique products. I know the market is competitive but we have unique and fun designs and provide quality items for a good price.

I know this isn't a lot of info to go off of but, if anyone had some advice I would really appreciate it.",1,1742314150.0,smallbusiness,1,1.0,False

Part 4,"I met Emma at a quiet coffee shop on the other side of town—somewhere neutral, somewhere that didn’t have years of memories attached to it. I got there first, sat in the back, and waited.

She walked in a few minutes later, looking exhausted. Dark circles under her eyes, hair tied back in a messy bun, no makeup. She looked… human. Not like some secret agent or a con artist. Just my wife—except now, I wasn’t sure if I even knew who she really was.

She sat down across from me, eyes searching my face. “Jack, please,” she said softly. “Just let me explain everything.”

I nodded, crossing my arms. “Start from the beginning. No more half-truths. No more vague answers. I need to know everything.”

She took a deep breath and started talking.

She told me that when she left her old job, she really did try to go straight. She wanted a normal life, a normal family. And for a while, she had that. But then, three years ago, someone from her past reached out—a former coworker named Alan. He had a case, something small, just a favor. He offered her $5,000 for a weekend’s worth of work.

“It was easy,” she admitted. “Too easy. And the money… it was good. It felt safe to have a backup, especially with the kids. I told myself it was just one time.”

But it wasn’t.

More cases came. More money. And eventually, she got comfortable with it. She justified it to herself—she wasn’t hurting anyone, she was just finding information, following trails, using skills she already had. But then, things started shifting. The requests got more specific. The clients got less ethical. She didn’t ask questions.

Then, about a year ago, she got involved in something bigger. A client asked her to track a man—just find out where he lived, what his schedule was. It wasn’t illegal, but it felt… wrong.

So she backed out. Told them she was done.

And that’s when things got worse.

The client didn’t take ""no"" for an answer. They knew who she was. They knew about me. About our kids.

“They said I owed them,” she whispered, gripping her coffee cup so tightly her knuckles turned white. “That I had to finish the job or… or there would be consequences.”

I felt a chill run through me. “What kind of consequences?”

She shook her head. “I don’t know. I didn’t want to find out. So I did what they asked. But after that, I really tried to get out. I changed numbers, cut off all my old contacts. I even started stashing cash in case we needed to run. But they found me again. They always find me.”

I leaned back in my chair, my mind spinning. “So you’re telling me… you’re in trouble.”

She nodded, tears welling up in her eyes. “Jack, I’m scared. I never wanted to drag you into this, but now I don’t know how to get out. And after you found the phone, I knew I couldn’t keep lying to you. I need help.”

I exhaled slowly, trying to process everything. This wasn’t just about betrayal anymore. It wasn’t just about her keeping secrets. My family was at risk.

I looked her in the eyes. “Who are these people?”

She hesitated, then shook her head. “I don’t know their real names. I only ever dealt with one guy—‘Mason.’ He’s the one who gave me the jobs, the one who threatened me. But he’s just a middleman. The real players? I don’t know.”

I ran a hand through my hair, my heart pounding. “We need to go to the police.”

“No,” she said immediately. “That’ll make it worse. If they think I’m talking, they’ll—” She swallowed hard. “They’ll make sure I can’t talk.”

I stared at her, the weight of everything sinking in. My wife wasn’t just keeping secrets—she was tangled in something dangerous. And now, so was I.

I don’t know what to do next. Do I take my kids and leave? Do I try to help her? Do I run?

I feel like my entire life just turned into a bad movie. And I have no idea how it’s going to end.

I need some help here before throwing my Homey Bridge out of here...

I have been using Ikea Trådfri for a long time and most of my bulbs in my house is connected.  
Using Ikea's own gateway have been working like a charm the whole time.  
One time setup, with their steering devices, connecting a lot of bulb's to the same switch.  
No problems at all.

So, a couple of weeks ago, I needed to connect my floor heat to some remote controlling and invested in a Homey Bridge. All seemed good, including the setup. A little work, but honestly I found it very exiting and a lot of ideas popped up :-)

After 1-2 hours of setting up all my lighting, I was ready to combine my switches with different lighting scenarios. So far, so good.

I also set up different scenarios in the app, e.g. ""Wake Up"" -> turned on all lights in the hallway, office, bathroom, living room and kitchen. It ever started my coffee machine.

BUT after a day or two, things happened... Turning on lights using the switches, was NOT responsive at all. In my kitchen, I was turning on 6 bulbs, it took 1-2 seconds to turn 3 of them on, 2 more after 4-5 seconds and the last one did not turn on at all. It is not consistent, sometimes it is more responsive, sometimes it takes 20 seconds...

I rebooted my Homey Bridge, and there was some change, but not as expected. After a day or two, responsiveness is terrible.

How does this actually work?  
Will my Ikea switches work if the Homey is off?  
Why the lack of responsiveness?  


Please help me out here, before moving back to the old days, with my Ikea Gateway and loose all the cool stuff.

Thanks.",1,1742313916.0,homey,0,1.0,False

A time when I’ve finally hit my stride or at least, I would if my knees didn’t sound like a bag of popcorn every time I stood up. But honestly, being over 40 is underrated. Here’s why I love it:
	•	Confidence is King – I no longer care what people think. Want to judge me for wearing Crocs with socks? Go ahead. I’m still getting my groceries in comfort.
	•	Selective Socializing – I only hang out with people I genuinely like. No more tolerating energy vampires just to be polite. If I don’t want to go, I don’t. Simple.
	•	Wisdom (or well-placed sarcasm) – I’ve been through enough nonsense to spot it a mile away. Life’s too short for bad coffee, pointless meetings, or debating with people who get their news from memes.
	•	Refining My Interests – I’m growing mushrooms now with my son. Not the kind that’ll get me on a government watchlist, but still, fungi are fascinating. And way less effort than maintaining a lawn. I of course love keeping in share (other than round). Additionally house projects and restoration projects as well. Last year I completely restored a 20yo boat from scratch and built 2 mini bikes. This year my son and I are restoring a Yamaha YZF 250. 
	•	Mature Humor (which is to say, it’s still immature) – Dry wit, sarcasm, and slapstick are my holy trinity. If you trip over something and it’s funny, I will laugh before helping you up. It’s the rule.
	•	Focus on the kids – while I always did this to begin with the sheer joy I get from being a parent and watching my kids and their friends thrive is indescribable. I do everything in my power to create a positive environment free of judgement (but with structure) to help my children thrive, learn and realize life is all about perspective. My personal favorite is creating memories through experiences. Being an active and involved parent is the greatest joy I’ve ever known that has only grown as I’ve gotten older.
	•	The Art of Doing Nothing – I no longer feel guilty for sitting on the couch doing absolutely nothing (as it rarely happens). That’s called self-care now, and I embrace it.

So yeah, 40+ is pretty awesome. Now, if only my metabolism and my ability to function on little sleep would get the memo.

Currently i wear: Moschino Toy 2 and Candles & Oud: Night in Paris. The first for the citrus scent and the second for the vanilla scent. 

I'm looking for recommendations for warm weather because I know some sweeter scents aren't for those climates. 

I really like gourmand scents, like pistachio, chocolate, coffee, cocunut, caramel and vanilla. Alongside fruity, tropical, citrusy scent. 

I've been looking at the Fiery God and the Tom Ford Lost Cherry dupe, but I'm not sure if they're worth it. 

I would love all of your recommendations. I am a male, but, I prefer more feminine scents, i feel like woody and musky scents don't suit me.

**Prologue**

The Past

A crowd of warriors stood across the plain fields, their armor dulled with dirt and blackened blood, their weapons bearing the scars of relentless battle. Around them, the remnants of a once-thriving land lay in ruin—damaged structures stood as skeletal remains, destroyed buildings reduced to rubble, and the battlefield stretched endlessly, soaked in blood and littered with lifeless bodies. Some still clung to the fragile thread of life as healers moved swiftly, their hands glowing faintly, desperate to pull the wounded back from the abyss.

At the heart of the battlefield stood a hooded figure, her frail form defying the carnage around her. The weight of years and burden rested upon her shoulders, yet she remained unwavering. In her trembling hands, she clutched a pendant, its sky-blue glow flickering like a fragile ember against the encroaching darkness. Tears traced silent paths down her aged face as she lifted her voice, heavy with grief yet resolute in purpose.

""The Rae shall not perish.""

A ripple of understanding passed through the weary warriors. As one, they plunged their swords into the earth, a thunderous sound resonating across the desolate plains—a single moment of silence, a vow to the fallen, a tribute to the brave who had sacrificed themselves so humanity might endure.

The Present

Seacliff Haven awakened with the hum of morning life. A humble town, home to fewer than a hundred residents, yet brimming with warmth and familiarity. The cobbled streets buzzed with the movement of townsfolk, shopkeepers meticulously arranging their wares while exchanging pleasantries with passing customers. Fishermen, their numbers modest but their presence vital, walked in clusters, their voices rising in animated discussion, sharing tales of the previous day's haul—stories ranging from modest catches to mythical creatures lurking in the depths, their words interwoven with both truth and embellishment. During the trading seasons, merchants from neighboring towns arrived, their stalls brightening the streets with exotic goods and rare finds. Children darted through the alleys, their laughter echoing as they played among the market stalls. The scent of salt and brine lingered in the crisp air, mingling with the aromas of freshly baked bread and brewing coffee, weaving together the simple, rhythmic life of Seacliff Haven.

Beyond the town's vibrant core, the skyline transformed. Rows of towering industrial structures loomed, stark against Seacliff’s historic charm, where the hum of productivity drowned out the echoes of tradition. Blue-collar workers hurried through streets, eyes flicking to their watches, their urgency dictated by schedules and quotas. In this part of the land, time is money, and every second mattered.

Nestled at the very heart of Seacliff Haven, Havenwood Academy stood as an unwavering pillar, a fortress of knowledge rising amidst the town’s bustling streets. Gothic spires loomed high, their shadows stretching across the marketplace below, an ever-present reminder of the academy’s dominance over the town’s identity. From its highest tower, a lone stone lion stood guard, its gaze fixed upon the sea beyond, an unyielding sentinel watching over both past and future. Its gothic spires clawed at the heavens, their dark stone etched with the weight of untold histories, whispering of forgotten eras.

Within the academy’s grand courtyard, the rhythmic footsteps of students echoed against the stone paths. Encircling the courtyard, two-story buildings housed the heart of the institution—one section dedicated to lecture halls, where knowledge was rigorously pursued, and another devoted to dormitories, where students found fleeting solace between their studies. The walls bore witness to aspirations, triumphs, and whispered fears alike.

Yet beyond the well-trodden paths and bustling halls, on the academy’s farthest edge, lay a structure seemingly untouched by time. The isolated block, sealed off from students, stood in defiance of curiosity, its silent presence a warning unspoken. Every semester, the head of the academy reiterated the rule: none were to approach. And none dared to ask why.

And so, in this place where past and present converged, where echoes of history lay beneath the surface of daily life, our story begins...",1,1742313377.0,Novels,0,1.0,False

I am in Gurgaon, and had the opportunity to have some fantastic filter coffee in Chennai some time back. I have had it in Bangalore many times but maybe I didnt go to the right place or something but Chennai one hits very different. 

I liked it so much that I bought that drip based steel filter from amazon and Kothas coffee but I have tried all permutation and combination of sugar and milk but it just doesnt taste right. ",1,1742313241.0,indiancoffee,0,1.0,False

1je881i,https://www.reddit.com/r/FinasterideSyndrome/comments/1je881i/2_years_post_crash/,2 years post crash,"Its been two years. 

When I crashed from a single half pill, my first and only dose of fin, i developed full body paresthesia (pins and needles, skin burning), an intense urge to urinate, numbness of my gentials, muscular fasticulations, and other minor issues aside. 

I lost my job, moved in with my mom, and started entertaining the idea of prematurely exiting my life. 

Now, I really never think about pfs. 

If I have a flare of paresthesia, its only in the palm of my left hand or toes and lasts an hour tops, but most days out of the month (9:10), there's no obvious disturbance. Same with urination. Same with everything else.

In the beginning, I thought my life was over. That was far from true it seems. 

My strategy for recovery was the following:
- workout 3-4 days a week minimum, focusing on strength and muscle growth
- no medication of any kind
- no supplememts of any kind
- no porn
- no drugs of any kind (minus coffee)
- read, play games, go on walks, talk to people about things as far removed from pfs as possible
- distract yourself in a healthy way
- live in daytime compartments, one day at a time
- trust the process

It took seven months initially to stop having full body paresthesia and a few more for the urge to urinate to die down.

The numbness in my genitals is slightly there, i still have bad days, I'm not 100% normal, but it's so damn close its like im functionally cured.

Time, time, time. Thats all we have. 

Stay strong soldiers.

I have clothespins.. with every tiny job written on each one. It doesn’t say clean kitchen, as that’s still a large task.. it says, ‘Coffee counter’, ‘toaster counter’, ‘Area rug’ etc. This helps break my jobs into tiny tiny chunks and keeps me focused and not overwhelmed! I put the clothespins in a bowl and I draw one out, clip it to the side of the bowl and clean just that until It’s done. Then I draw another, etc. I have been doing this for a few weeks and It’s been life changing, so I figure that It’s time to share it with others! When I have my husband and kids help, they can all draw a job out and we clean together! It’s great! 

(If It’s extra things or I haven’t made clothespins for a different room.. I do the old fashioned write it on paper and fold it up! Like for my bedroom.. ‘Dresser’, ‘My desk’, ‘Floor by foot of bed’, ‘Unload one doom box’ etc. Seriously helps!! ",7,1742313153.0,ufyh,0,1.0,False

I picked up these books over the past year, each one promissing something different for my personal growth journey. The stack sitting on my coffee table has become a conversation starter when friends visit 🤣. 

""The Art of Home"" caught my eye at the bookstore with it's gorgeous cover. I browse through it occasionally but haven't implemented much - the ideas look great but my budget disagrees.

Mark Manson's ""The Subtle Art"" cut through the typical self-help nonsense. I highlighted so many passages about values versus goals, tho sometimes the constant F-bombs felt like overkill. This book actually changed how I aproach problems.

Carnegie's classic ""How to Win Friends"" feels dated but wow, the advice works! I started using his name-remembering technique at work and my boss noticed the difference. Some parts dragged on but the core message stuck with me.

""The Mountain Is You"" spoke to me during a dark period. Wiest's ideas about self-sabotage as protection hit home, even if some sections went too deep into the spiritual stuff for my taste. I still use her journaling prompts.

Van der Kolk's ""The Body Keeps the Score"" was the heaviest red. I had to take breaks while learning how trauma affects the physical body. The science parts confused me sometimes but the case studies made me cry.

""Attached"" exposed my relationship patterns with painful accuracy. I'm definitely the anxious type who chases avoidants! The communication strategies helped me voice my needs better, which my current partner appreciates.

""Surrounded by Idiots"" gave me a simple color system for understanding coworkers. I recognize myself as a ""blue"" and my boss as a ""red,"" which explains our miscommunications.

""Ikigai"" introduced me to the Japanese concept of finding purpose. I've started doing the morning stretches but haven't fully found my ikigai yet. I'm working on it thou!​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​

I thought by being faithful and not being abusive, that was good enough.

She has always complained that I don’t listen to her, though we’ve never really communicated what that means, until recently. If she’s having a bad day it means she wants to be surprised with a coffee or something. It’s really simple things, but I’ve just never put 2 and 2 together. I want to be better for her. I want to do these simple things for her. 

Here’s my problem, I’ve never paid enough attention, I don’t know things like her favorite drink from Starbucks. Well, I didn’t, I have it on a note now. Basically, even though we’ve been together so long, I don’t really know my wife, so I’m getting to know her. But I don’t know what I don’t know.

**Why This Pick?**

The Canucks have been a wildcard lately – having won just 2 of their last 5 games, I’m not exactly lining up to bet on them. Vancouver has lost 3 of Kevin Lankinen’s last 4 starts by at least 2 goals. On the other side, Winnipeg has won 5 of their last 6 outings and only 1 of those victories required OT to get the job done. In addition, the Winnipeg Jets have won 6 of their last 7 meetings with the Canucks by *at least* 2 goals. Between winning their last meeting with the Canucks 6-1, Hellebuyck in net tonight, and the Jets offense firing on all cylinders, there’s only one pick here that really makes sense. Give me Winnipeg to bag a win in regulation for plus money.

Phobia of relationships/ falling in love, because you're scared what if the current one also turns out to be a bad apple like the previous?

One example, a guy used to flirt with me for a very long time over texts (Instagram). He was part of a social circle which I also knew (acquaintances). I'm saying 6-8 months of flirting, and then he had invited me for a coffee too. At this time, he was unemployed and searching for jobs as well. I had been very supportive of him mentally/ emotionally despite being younger than him

When he did get a job, he completely changed. He started ghosting me, and not give a clear answer when I decided to approach him. If he said ""no"" i would have respected him but he was purposelly trying to keep me hanging.

I'm mentally strong (have seen many things in life), so I eventually dropped him. Stopped talking. Stopped replying at all. He is no longer in my life even if he tries occassionally (even now).

I have seen many such examples around me (not personal as my experience is very less with only talking stages with 2 guys), but horrible/ mentally abusive things. And these men appear perfect (""nice guys"") from outside

I have developed a phobia somehow which is not letting me date, because I'm afraid of falling in love and the person turns out to be an abuser/ someone who abandons you in future. Because it's NOT possible to predict; you can date 100% green flag but you're not God that you will foresee it... and i have seen this happen even in arranged marriages

How do I get over this? I'm rushed to marry because I'm 25, but there's this blocker. Every single man is scary because ""what if"". I find myself taking a step back even if i feel like approaching someone... because I do not want to get hurt by them.

1je82wz,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1je82wz/a_proper_labour_of_love_rebuilding_my_dads_old/,A proper labour of love; Rebuilding my dad’s old Optiplex,"Had to share this - it mightn't be as fancy or expensive a setup as most of the rigs on here, but I can guarantee you it's priceless where it counts.

My dad retired during the pandemic, having used the same Dell Optiplex for twenty years at work. Every time someone suggested upgrading, he refused. He liked things set up just the way they were, and saw no reason to change. His IT dept basically left him to it, one fellow in particular who took pity on him and came in to tune up the old Windows XP rather than force major updates and upgrades. 

When he finally retired during the pandemic, his workplace let him take it home. I know for a fact they cant even have fully wiped it, as I did enough maintenance on it for dad that I saw some files buried on there that probably shouldnt have left the company! But since then, his PC became his outlet and coping mechanism in retirement.  He is constantly writing on it, including books that have even been published. That old PC held a lifetime’s worth of his own documents, some of it backed up… but (despite my constant advice) not as regularly as you’d hope.

Then, just after Christmas, disaster struck. The old dog finally packed it in (the PC I mean, not dad!). My brother and I offered to pitch in and buy him something newer and faster, like a laptop so he could go to type from his favouite coffee place, but he wouldn’t hear of it - he worked on *his* computer in *his * study. A true creature of habit...He wasjjust heartbroken, but after so many years with one machine he couldnt jmagjne replacing it and starting from scratch.

Seeing him quietly despondent like that was so sad, I had to take matters into my own hands. While visiting for his birthday last month, I quietly noted the make and model, then ordered replacement parts: new core, fan, RAM sticks, SSD, and HDD. All with the aim of restoring the machine he loved, but bringing it up to scratch under the bonnet.

When everything arrived, I waited for the right moment. While he was out for a drive with my mum, I nipped over and got to work. I swapped out the old innards for new parts; cloned over his original workstation onto the SSD; salvaged what I could from the hard drive. My brother pitched in so between us we could recreate from memory the look and feel of his desktop as closely as possible with shortcuts, desktop background, everything. We even gave the case a proper clean with a dust blower and alcohol. By the time he got home, it was back in its usual spot, powered on and running quietly.

His face when he saw it… I’ve never seen my dad speechless before. He’s a quiet, stoic man, not one for emotional̀ displays, but when he realised what we’d done, there was a tear in his eye. First time I’ve ever seen that. Watching him browse through everything, rediscovering his files and seeing how smoothly it all ran, with joy and awe, was like watching a lttle boy opening a Playstation from Santa.

We’re already mentioned in the acknowledgements of one of his books, but after this I reckon we’ll have our own chapter.

If I configure it for 1920 the main window works - but I cannot get the lower screen to work (at full resolution or half resolution).

The strange thing is that if I change hyprland.conf WHILST it is running then it refreshes and the main screen works at 4k (until I reboot).

The really strange thing (to me) is that Gnome starts up fine at full resolution for BOTH monitors and doesnt complain at all(!!!)

I am happy to add config files etc - but mainly looking for pointers on what to tweak next..

Just like how you remember your friend likes coffee black, AI agents need memory to truly help us. Without it, they're just fancy calculators responding to the present moment.

Memory lets AI agents:

– Remember your preferences (so you don't repeat yourself constantly)

– Learn from past interactions (getting smarter over time)

– Make predictions based on patterns (spotting market trends before they happen)

Ozak AI is building prediction agents that leverage both short-term memory (for immediate context) and long-term memory (for deeper pattern recognition). The agents analyze real-time market data while recalling historical patterns, helping traders avoid emotional decisions and maximize returns.

Imagine having a trading partner who remembers every market crash, rally, and trend from the past decade, using that knowledge to guide your next move!

The concert hall is on the Gulf of Mexico/America, west of the barrier island Longboat Key. The location made the hall very delightful. We haven't yet to have meal here but have coffee and drinks in the outdoor area, watching the sunset.

The 1,741 seats are nicely spread out from the stage like a seashell. Rows are rather long, with the holders (drinks are allowed inside, where the opera house a stone throw away won't - pls take a note -:) ha ha ha), getting in and out of the middle seats are little difficult. Over all, it's an enjoyable venue for the patrons.

Perlman's recital has planned program, from works of three composers. It's an hour long, plus a short intermission after the second composer.

Bach (16 minutes)
Strauss (29 min)
Schumann (17 min)
The playbill ran out before the concert start - first time ever, so I've to take a photo of my neighbor's.

When he re-emerges after the intermission, a man yelled, ""I love you Itzhak.""
White haired grandpa in PJ picks up the microphone, said, ""thank you.""
Then goes on to say, while in the backstage, he called Mr Schumann, who said the next three pieces are short but hope he'll play them without interruption - aka applause.
""I said to Mr Schumann that I don't care but Mr Schumann insists.""
So there isn't an applause. To be honest, I do feel bewildered when the inappropriate applauds occur. There is a teen boy sits to my right who knows exactly when to applause - a future classical musician or a violist? Among the mostly grey haired audience, there are a few teens, some are alone and some are with their parents. All look like political and educated. Hope the number will grow larger ...
After the Schumann's pieces, it's free program.
""I've a computer printout that I played here since 1912 ..."" laughs. ""If you were here in 1912, your hearing is probably not very good ... "" more laughs

Then a person yells, ""Schindler's List.""

... John Williams composed the score for the movie, and he performed the main theme. He played it at the concert we went two years ago, almost to the date.

He didn't play it immediately but ends the night with it. Then encores with a fast paced Spanish piece.

I became interested in going to church at all after the pandemic and really enjoyed the Orthodox church I went to. The priest was very warm and welcoming, and unlike the other churches I checked out, his sermon was actually very humble and thought-provoking. He even sat with me during coffee hour and just talked with me since he didn't recognize me (something none of the other churches I visited bothered to do).

I spent the next couple years reading a lot about theology and trying to convince myself that all this stuff, which for my whole life I was believed was just myth, was true. I didn't become anti-evolution or anything crazy like that, but I listened to podcasts like ""The Lord of Spirits"" to make sense of angels and demons and Bible stories I had always believed were just superstition. I even really tried to commit to the fasting stuff and moral living, though I failed at it frequently. I used to pray every day. I made good friends at my current church as well, and we hung out outside of church too.

I don't pray or fast at all anymore; about the only thing I really tried to keep in my private life from Orthodox stuff is more almsgiving. I still like a lot of those people. But especially around the fasting seasons like Lent, I get this extreme distaste in my mouth for the whole thing because of how much like a burdensome obligation it seems. And on top of that, all these justifications I came to about the supernatural stuff — about the Trinity and the Incarnation and angels and demons and all of it — I just don't believe it in my heart anymore. I used to believe that religion was just a way for human beings to add some sense of meaning and excitement to life, and after putting that belief away, I'm starting to feel it all over again.

I still go to church and take communion and all, but it feels more like something I *do* rather than something I *want* to do. It makes me feel ungrateful to the people who took me in and were genuinely nice to me. Does anyone else have a similar experience?",3,1742312324.0,exorthodox,0,1.0,False
1je7v3c,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1je7v3c,A proper labour of love; Rebuilding my dad’s old Optiplex,"Apologies in advance, this wont be as fancy or expensive a setup as most of the rigs on here, but I can guarantee you it's priceless where it counts.

My dad retired during the pandemic, having used the same Dell Optiplex for twenty years at work. Every time someone suggested upgrading, he refused. He liked things set up just the way they were, and saw no reason to change. His IT dept basically left him to it, one fellow in particular who took pity on him and came in to tune up the old Windows XP rather than force major updates and upgrades. 

When he finally retired during the pandemic, his workplace let him take it home. I know for a fact they cant even have fully wiped it, as I did enough maintenance on it for dad that I saw some files buried on there that probably shouldnt have left the company! But since then, his PC became his outlet and coping mechanism in retirement.  He is constantly writing on it, including books that have even been published. That old PC held a lifetime’s worth of his own documents, some of it backed up… but (despite my constant advice) not as regularly as you’d hope.

Then, just after Christmas, disaster struck. The old dog finally packed it in (the PC I mean, not dad!). My brother and I offered to pitch in and buy him something newer and faster, like a laptop so he could go to type from his favouite coffee place, but he wouldn’t hear of it - he worked on *his* computer in *his * study. A true creature of habit...He wasjjust heartbroken, but after so many years with one machine he couldnt jmagjne replacing it and starting from scratch.

Seeing him quietly despondent like that was so sad, I had to take matters into my own hands. While visiting for his birthday last month, I quietly noted the make and model, then ordered replacement parts: new core, fan, RAM sticks, SSD, and HDD. All with the aim of restoring the machine he loved, but bringing it up to scratch under the bonnet.

When everything arrived, I waited for the right moment. While he was out for a drive with my mum, I nipped over and got to work. I swapped out the old innards for new parts; cloned over his original workstation onto the SSD; salvaged what I could from the hard drive. My brother pitched in so between us we could recreate from memory the look and feel of his desktop as closely as possible with shortcuts, desktop background, everything. We even gave the case a proper clean with a dust blower and alcohol. By the time he got home, it was back in its usual spot, powered on and running quietly.

His face when he saw it… I’ve never seen my dad speechless before. He’s a quiet, stoic man, not one for emotional̀ displays, but when he realised what we’d done, there was a tear in his eye. First time I’ve ever seen that. Watching him browse through everything, rediscovering his files and seeing how smoothly it all ran, with joy and awe, was like watching a lttle boy opening a Playstation from Santa.

We’re already mentioned in his books' acknowledgements but after this I reckon we'll have our own chapter.

I've been falling down a rabbit hole lately with this trend called **Japandi**, and I'm officially obsessed.

It's a perfect blend of **Japanese minimalism** and **Scandinavian coziness**—natural wood tones and a vibe that screams “calm.” Imagine sipping your morning coffee in a space that doesn't feel like it's judging your messy dish pile.

That's the dream, right?

I started digging into this because I'm that weirdo who's already plotting 2025 home upgrades (*don't judge me; I just love a good project*). Japandi is apparently huge this year, and I get why. It's not just about looking pretty—it's functional, too.

You've got practical open shelving, muted colors that don't overwhelm, and textures like bamboo or ceramic that make everything feel earthy but modern. It's like Marie Kondo and IKEA had a baby, and I'm here for it.

So, I wrote this article called **15 Smashing Japandi Kitchen Decor Ideas That Will Dominate 2025** ...to inspire you.

Full Read: [https://chosenfurniture.com/japandi-kitchen-decor-ideas-for-2025/](https://chosenfurniture.com/japandi-kitchen-decor-ideas-for-2025/)

It breaks it down with some killer pics and ideas—stuff like swapping out loud backsplashes for soft neutrals, adding pendant lights that don't scream “industrial warehouse,” and even tossing in plants to keep it alive but not jungle-level chaotic.

This one set up with a wooden island is so simple but luxe that I'm half-tempted to rip out my current countertops tomorrow. They also mention mixing in little pops of contrast, like black hardware or a woven rug, without ruining the zen.

Honestly, it's got me rethinking my whole cluttered kitchen game – maybe less is more?

I'm curious if anyone's tried this style at home. Do you have a Japandi kitchen hack or a favorite piece you'd recommend? I'm already eyeing a set of wooden spoons and maybe a matte ceramic mug or ten.

If you've got pics of your setup, drop ‘em – I need more fuel for this obsession.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1je7m8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1je7m8x/parents_of_high_needs_newbornsit_gets_better_i/,Parents of high needs newborns…it gets better. I promise.,"This is a message for all of the parents in the thick of it with a newborn, or high needs baby. It truly does get better. 

My baby is almost 9 months old. I’m a FTM and a nurse who works with newborns. I felt prepared and competent. Then, my high needs baby was born and let me tell you, I struggled. I felt completely overwhelmed, exhausted and like a failure. My baby had allergies and reflux. He cried non-stop. He slept in 20minute intervals and would not sleep without being held. He hated life and I hated that I couldn’t make him happy. My house was a disaster. I was depressed and felt like I was drowning. I barely ate or showered or slept. I dreaded days alone with him because I felt so anxious about him crying that I couldn’t even put him down to go to the bathroom. I was miserable. 

My husband was the best partner I could ask for. We took shifts in the night of holding him. He prepped me coffee and meals between meetings. He worked from home and would hold him in the wrap so I could get an extra bit of sleep. Looking back I was lucky. But I was so so so exhausted. I constantly thought “what have I done? I can’t live like this! I will die from exhaustion!”

Meanwhile, my best friend had a baby who was sleeping 6h stretches at 6 weeks old. It was just easy for them. I was happy for her but was also envious and bitter. 

Lack of sleep is truly a form of torture and it messes with you. You can’t see the end. This is your sign that there is an end. 

At 3 months we figured out his allergies and things got a little better. At 5 months we realized he was having trouble with breastfeeding and I started pumping. Things got a little better. At 6 months he figured out crawling and was so happy to be on the move. At 7 months he was still waking every 40min to 1.5h so we sleep trained which was not an easy decision but things got so so much better. 

Today he is almost 9 months. Last night he woke up twice in the night. My husband and I took turns. I got 7.5h of sleep. I put him down for a nap this morning in his own crib. He slept for an hour and a half. During that time I had my coffee, ate breakfast and showered. He woke up happy and playful. Today we will go for a walk in the sun because he doesn’t scream in the stroller anymore. He loves to look around and babble. He is my little buddy. 

I don’t say this to brag. I say it because I was in the depths of newborn hell and I felt the guilt and resentment and despair. When someone would tell me “it gets better” I would think “ya right…when? you don’t get it”. But I promise I do get it. And it did get better. And if you just hold on, it will for you too. ❤️",59,1742311662.0,NewParents,19,0.97,False

Depending on the beans, I can now adjust to 16 but the P2 chokes at 14-15. That leaves 16 grinder positions that are completely useless. Seems to me I ought to have a few more useful clicks before Turkish powder happens at 12-14. I have not tried to grind coffee at those lower settings but I can say the burrs do not touch, even at the smallest setting. There are no more shims to remove. I've sent an inquiry to Baratza's support. More later. ",2,1742311567.0,FlairEspresso,1,1.0,False

Was too much of a pain to just edit the post on mobile) To start, I really don’t think I’m in the wrong here but maybe the Court of Reddit Opinion can help me see things differently. 

Sorry for the long rant. TLDR: invited a friend for St. Paddy’s weekend shenanigans, didn’t realize he was having a bad time until he separated from me, and I let him go off on his own in a city he was unfamiliar with. AITAH?

I live in a city where St. Paddy’s Day is a big deal. Like the biggest weekend in my city. Schools are closed if the holiday falls on a week day and there’s a huge parade. My office does a big breakfast celebration for us to bring our friends and family, and then everyone breaks off to go watch the parade. No work that day. It’s a great time. 

I (single 35f) invited a long time friend (single 35m) to join me for the weekend. We’re way past our party days but thought it would still be a fun time and he’s talked about wanting to visit. So the plan was he would come down (lives 4 hours from me) on Saturday morning and we would bar hop a bit downtown that night. Sunday was planned to be really low key where we stayed in. Due to road closures for the parade, I knew we would have to leave a little early Monday morning to get to my office on time. 

So Saturday was tons of fun. Showed him all of my favorite places. Had a nice evening when we got back to my house. Woke up on Sunday to a cold, dreary and rainy day. Not at all suitable weather to walk around the downtown area. So we ordered pizza and laid in my bed all day while binge watching HarmonQuest. 

Monday morning came around and everything still seemed to be going well. We got ready together and did silly face tattoos with each other. Then him, my aunt, and I all made our way to my office. I introduced him to my bosses and their families. We had a bunch of laughs over a decent amount of mimosas and Irish coffees. At one point he said something to the effect of “You can ask Ken, she knows I’m extra af” and I laughed and responded “Oh so now you’re admitting to being Dame Aylin (a character from a game we both love and that I refer to as being “extra”). He laughed. Everyone laughed. Then it was time to walk and find a spot to catch the parade. So him, my aunt, and I started the 10 block walk. He was bouncing around having fun and enjoying the merriment shared across the streets. Then out of no where came up to me and said “You don’t seem to want me around at all. I’ve felt like this since yesterday. All you wanted to do was sit at home. So I’m going to go off on my own and enjoy the last few hours I have in town.” ?!?!?!?! I told him I was sorry for making him feel that way but this was the first he mentioned anything and I genuinely never thought anything had been wrong before. But if he wanted to go off on his own then fine. He knew my address to get back to his car and said he would get his own uber. Ok cool, I guess? 

So my aunt and I continued on with the original plan: catch the parade, go have lunch, and go home to recover after all the day drinking. Phone service was incredibly unreliable due to the large number of people out on the street. He tried sending a few messages but the only text I received was “are you getting my messages?”. He tried to call but I couldn’t hear over all the parade and crowd noises. Then my phone died during lunch. My aunt and I went back home shortly after lunch where I passed out almost immediately. He made it back to my house at some point after me. Crawled into bed next to me and asked if he could nap before making his 4 hour drive back home. I told him that was fine but when he started to try to cuddle and be affectionate I got uncomfortable and got up to sit at my desk. At some point he got up and took a phone call. I caught bits of the conversation like “totally messed up right? Probably won’t be back. Still a good time.” By this time I had my phone charged back up and saw the barrage of messages come in. One after the other calling me names like unappreciative and a bitch for leaving him alone in a city he was unfamiliar with. Told me how he had asked other people for their opinion and they all said it was incredibly messed up to treat him like I did when he drove down here to see me. All of this stuff that had been bothering him but never before mentioned to me until he broke off from me on the way to parade. I got very angry seeing all the messages, realized that phone call had been about me, and ended up telling him he needed to leave then. That he wasn’t going to try to get fresh with me in my bed while he is walking around my house talking shit about me. He called me later from the road wanting to talk things out and I told him he lost that chance when he decided to talk to everyone but me and that I simply didn’t want to hear from him again. I got a text later asking if I would be sending him money on cash app to pay him back. I sent him a screenshot showing I had sent $100 on Saturday night and haven’t spoken since. I’m now back at work wondering if I had been wrong to let him go off on his own but at the same time just start fuming when I think about the whole turn of events. Am I just so angry that I can’t see where I should have been better to him? It sucks since this is someone I’ve been friends with for 10+ years, but if he was so unhappy prior to the breakfast/parade why not speak up about it? Based off his behavior and how affectionate he was on Sunday I would have never thought he was uncomfortable or unhappy in the slightest. Why is it so hard for people to use their words? Am I missing something?

It’s like that one friend who always knows the best spots in town and makes everything easy. So, grab a coffee (or a smoothie if you’re fancy), and let’s dive into why Zypto is the real deal.

**What Even Is Zypto?**

Okay, so Zypto is basically your all-in-one crypto BFF. It’s a wallet app, a payment gateway, and even hooks you up with crypto cards—both virtual and physical. Imagine being able to pay for your Netflix subscription or that sweet pair of sneakers with crypto, without breaking a sweat. That’s Zypto in a nutshell. They’re all about making blockchain payments as simple as sending a Venmo.

The team behind Zypto has been at it for years, cooking up ways to make crypto actually usable in the real world. And let me tell ya, they’re nailing it. Whether you’re a freelancer wanting to get paid in Bitcoin or a small biz owner looking to spice up your payment options, Zypto’s got something for you.

**Why Zypto’s Wallet App Is Like Your New Favorite Toy**

Let’s talk about the Zypto Wallet App first because it’s honestly the star of the show. It’s like having a Swiss Army knife for crypto in your pocket—except it won’t accidentally poke you. Here’s why I’m obsessed:

Super Easy to Use: If you can use your banking app without pulling your hair out, you’ll be fine with Zypto. It’s got that “I can figure this out in five minutes” vibe.

Multi-Chain Magic: You can manage all sorts of DeFi wallets in one spot. No more juggling a million apps like you’re a circus performer.

Swap Like a Pro: Need to trade some tokens? Zypto’s got built-in swaps that are smoother than your go-to playlist.

I mean, come on, who doesn’t love an app that doesn’t crash and actually does what it promises? It’s like finding a unicorn in a sea of donkeys.

**Zypto Pay: Making Crypto Payments Less Scary**

Now, if you’re a business owner (or dreaming of becoming one), Zypto Pay is gonna be your new crush. It’s their payment gateway that lets you accept crypto without needing a PhD in blockchain. Setup’s a breeze—think “faster than assembling IKEA furniture” kind of breeze.

Picture this: You’re selling handmade candles online (because your lavender ones are to die for), and someone wants to pay with Ethereum. With Zypto Pay, you don’t have to panic and Google “how to accept crypto without losing my mind.” It’s all streamlined, secure, and honestly kinda fun to watch those payments roll in.

**Crypto Cards That Feel Like Magic**

Okay, this part’s my favorite because who doesn’t love a good card? Zypto offers both virtual and physical crypto cards that you can reload with your favorite cryptocurrencies and spend anywhere. It’s like having a debit card, but cooler because you’re basically flexing your crypto skills.

Virtual Cards: Perfect for online shopping sprees. Fund it with crypto, spend in local currency—boom, done.
Physical Cards: For when you wanna swipe IRL. They’ve got high limits, so you can treat yourself to that fancy dinner without a hitch.
Reloadable Options: No need to toss ‘em after one use. Keep topping up and keep swiping.
I used one of their virtual cards to buy a new gaming mouse online, and I felt like a tech wizard. No weird conversion drama—just pure, seamless shopping bliss.

**Pay Your Bills with Crypto (Yes, Really!)**

Here’s where Zypto gets extra spicy: you can pay your bills with crypto! They support it in 10 countries right now (with more coming soon), so you can settle your credit card, utilities, or even your mortgage without touching your bank account. It’s like telling your landlord, “Here’s some Bitcoin for the rent,” and watching their jaw drop.

I haven’t tried this yet (my utility company’s still stuck in the Stone Age), but I’m itching to. There’s something so satisfying about paying for boring adult stuff with futuristic money.

**The Zypto Vault Key Card: Fort Knox for Your Crypto**

If you’re paranoid about security (like me after watching one too many hacker movies), Zypto’s got a neat trick up its sleeve: the Zypto Vault Key Card. It turns your app into a cold storage hardware wallet, keeping your assets offline until you’re ready to use ‘em. It’s like locking your crypto in a safe that only you can open—no sketchy internet stuff to worry about.

I’m not saying hackers are lurking around every corner, but having this kind of peace of mind? Priceless.

**What’s Next for Zypto? Spoiler: It’s Big**

Zypto’s not just chilling—they’re always cooking up something new. They’ve got partnerships with big names like Stellar and MoneyGram, which means you can cash in or out USDC at MoneyGram locations worldwide. No bank account? No problem! Plus, they’re rolling out services like Crypto Bill Pay in more countries (Egypt and Malaysia just joined the party).

**$ZYPTO token—Zypto’s shiny little gem!**

It’s the native token of their ecosystem, and think of it like the VIP pass to all the cool stuff Zypto offers. Holding $ZYPTO gets you some sweet perks, like revenue sharing from their payment gateway fees (yep, they spread the love), exclusive discounts on services, and access to their Rewards Hub where you can snag Zypto Points (ZYPS) to swap for virtual cards or other goodies.

It’s built on the Ethereum blockchain, so it’s got that solid foundation, and the community vibe around it is strong—Zyptonians (as they call themselves) are all about hyping it up. The token’s designed to fuel the whole “crypto payments going mainstream” mission, and honestly, it’s a fun way to feel like you’re part of something bigger while maybe saving a few bucks on fees.

I'm rather nerdy. I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

1je7ixk,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1je7ixk/i_unfollowed_her_because_i_felt_like_her_interest/,"I unfollowed her because I felt like her interest had plummeted, but I'm afraid I made a mistake","Hi, everyone.

I'll try to keep it brief, but it's a long and tortuous story, and I'm naturally verbose.

Anyway, a woman in my grad program introduced herself to me back in September, and I was instantly smitten, as she seemed exactly my type: intelligent, artsy, etc. For a while, she was constantly inviting me to do things with her, coming around just to spend time with me, and the like. I was on cloud 9, and couldn't believe my luck.

After she made her intentions known, however, that she wanted to date, and things took a more expressly romantic and sexual turn, behaviors began to surface that made me question whether it was such a good idea. Once she saw a handsome man in public, and described him as ""the most beautiful man I'd ever seen,"" which I found strange, as if it was calculated to draw a negative reaction out of me or undercut my self-esteem or something. She also demonstrated a tendency to become borderline enraged over comments that I found anodyne or innocuous, and would storm off or resort to profanity and name-calling. She went on a date with another guy, which she told me about eventually when the topic of exclusivity came up, but she left one of our dates for this other one at the time, and crafted a lie to explain her departure. Finally, although there are other misgivings I could mention (I'm abridging the list to spare you the wall of text), she seemed to have little regard for my schedule, and would ask to hang out last minute despite looming deadlines. If she had something she had to get done, it was a firm boundary, but if I did, it was something for her to negotiate and overcome. All in all, cracks in the perfect facade began to appear, and although I tried to rationalize them away (everyone is flawed, right?), I couldn't shake the feeling deep down that I was making a mistake.

At the same time, however, she was closer to a ""real"" partner than I'd come before: she would say things like ""you'd be such a good dad,"" ""I feel safe with you,"" ""I'm lucky to know you,"" etc. I felt like those verbal attestations, coupled with her desire to see me at every opportunity, stay the night, be intimate, etc. indicated that she was truly and deeply invested.

Granted, she did tell me when she proposed dating that she had ended an 8-year relationship within the past year, and wasn't ready for a full commitment yet. She estimated that she could be within 6 months, which gave me hope that, if things went well, our ""no-pressure"" dates could evolve into something substantial.

As things continued, they seemingly got better and worse at the same time. On the one hand, she'd bring up the possibility of doing things together in the long-term like a summer vacation, but on the other, when I went home for Christmas break, I didn't receive a call or text for 3 weeks (not even a ""merry Christmas"" or ""happy New Year"") from someone who professed to ""really like"" me. When I got back from the holidays, we met up as we had grown accustomed to doing, were intimate, and the like. However, she mentioned that she should be going out less ""to save money"" and maybe should refrain from staying the night, ostensibly due to how small and uncomfortable my bed is.

Around the six-month mark, I checked in, and mentioned this strange paradox of deepening and lessening intimacy. She acknowledged that ""the vibe was different from last semester,"" but insisted she was busier (something that clashed with her other statement to the effect that she had extremely lenient due dates.) I effectively told her that I found casual dating with someone I liked unfulfilling and even masochistic, and wasn't interested in investing in something that wasn't going to progress and that was inevitably going to end. She told me she regretted giving the 6-month benchmark, as it was unrealistic, and she's still figuring out what she wants. I told her that's fine, but we want different things.

She asked me to a coffee shortly thereafter, and, one thing leading to another, she came back to my apartment and we were intimate, although I felt an uneasiness, an uncanniness, like I could see her putting on a false appearance in real time with her performance of affection, as it felt contrived and like she was merely going through the motions to give me what she thought I wanted to keep me around. She told me she wasn't sure I still wanted to do ""this"" - meaning spend time making out, having sex, cuddling, etc. - and I responded by saying that I'm not sure what I want: I felt like I really liked her, but I also knew we had incompatible desires. She told me that if I didn't want to see her, I should just say that. The night ended unremarkably, and we went our separate ways. It was vague as to whether we were still ""casually dating.""

Weeks went by, and while she would occasionally text, they were short, unemotional, and didn't involve asking me out or asking to come over, unlike precedent. She came along to see a movie on my birthday (she had completely forgotten it was my birthday, which I felt let down by), but other than that, if I asked her to come over or stick around, the answer was always a ""no"" or a ""we'll definitely do something later."" This new, even more nebulous status quo had exacerbated every doubt and insecurity I'd had about the status quo ante, as it was even more noncommittal albeit with little to no affection. Were we still dating? The only indicator I got that she still cared was when she insistently pressed me about the nature of my relationship with a woman I spent some time with on my birthday weekend, but even then, her jealousy seemed muted and fleeting.

The other day, she effectively ignored me in class besides making brief small talk in favor of walking, chatting, laughing, and sitting with some guy she claims to be friends with. She left with him, not turning to say goodbye to me or anything. I later entered a work area on campus, and saw them sitting together. She spoke with me somewhat, but the contrast, to me, felt dramatic between how she'd interact with him as opposed to me. She seemed genuinely interested in exchanging with him: her eyes lit up, she'd giggle, make playful faces. She seemed like an infatuated schoolgirl making eyes at ""the bad boy."" The enthusiasm, the active participation, the body language all suggested flirting, something she hadn't done with me in weeks, if not months. As we were leaving, I tried to strike up conversation, but while she began answering me, this guy - who she told me not to worry about months ago, by the way - boldly inserted himself, and she pivoted away from me to explain to him and then essentially embark upon a whole other conversation, leaving me behind. In that conversation, she seemingly asked him to a movie. She only turned to say ""bye"" to me when I began to feel ridiculous and finally left.

That night, feeling hopeless that we'd ever recover the intensity and seeming affection of those early days, I unfollowed her on one social media platform. When I awoke, I found that she'd unfollowed me back, and deleted her likes from my posts (which may indicate that she blocked me as well.) My stomach immediately dropped and I began to regret doing this. Maybe I overreacted? Maybe I was being childish? Should I write and tell her it was a mistake (in a way, it kind of was: my finger hovered over the button for so long, when I actually pushed it, it wasn't wholly intentional)? If I were to try and walk this back, would it be pointless, me prolonging the torment of a clearly dead pseudo-relationship? Was I an asshole for wordlessly unfollowing, in a way that probably struck her as sudden, and not trying to tell her directly that I can't exist in this relational limbo anymore?",1,1742311421.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I (28F) recently received an email following an application to naturalise as a British Citizen. It’s a long process, and I needed two referees to sign a form, essentially confirming they were reasonable people who knew me enough to vouch for me in the application. 

One of them is a friend, (90M). I want to gift him and my other referee with a small, but meaningful gift, to express my gratitude and as a memory of something that wouldn’t have happened if he hadn’t help the way he did. He gave me advice throughout the process, like which passport photo I should use, how to word best an email, etc. Most importantly, when he signed, he signed a form that said he could be charged a fine of £5000 for inaccurate information. To put it simply: he’s known be from church for years, but if I had lied or omitted doing something against the guidelines for naturalising, he would still be charged that fine. So what I mean is when I asked him to be my referee, he believed me, and believed I was a “person of good character” when he had no way to prove it. If I wasn’t , if I’d lied, he’d be compromising himself, but him and my other referee both put themselves in a difficult position when vouching for someone they’d known for 7 years, and I that means so much to me. 

On my friend - I’d like to know your thoughts on what to get him. 
He once told me at Christmas (he invited me to spend it with him and his wife) that I mustn’t get them any presents for Christmas because “we have everything we need. When we need something, we go out and buy it”. Basically cause I wasn’t earning much at the time so he tried to put my mind at ease. 

He’s a retired doctor, he spends a lot of time at church, he is a churchwarden and a safeguarding officer for the church. He’s our doctor on site if someone feels ill during the service. He’s very intelligent, and at home he enjoys some gardening, he spent most of his life travelling the world and he loves learning about different cultures and different people. He enjoys a drink, trying out new things. No children and not into new technology, he has a flip phone. He reads the paper dutifully, enjoys tea and coffee, and an occasional drink. He has his own personal pen he carries everywhere, and only uses it to write or sit , he never takes any other pen. 

Appreciate any suggestions, thank you",2,1742311271.0,AskOldPeopleAdvice,10,1.0,False

I did it over FaceTime, it wasn’t intentional I was going to meet her today to stay at hers but I didn’t want to do it in her house. I ended up saying if she can meet me in a park or coffee shop to chat, she asked why and if u was breaking up with her, I couldn’t lie and said Yh. We’ve been together five months and I’m recovering addict, I’m maturing week by week and I’m not ready for a longer commitment. She was left thinking if I was fake the whole time even loved her, I said no I don’t love her but it could have turned into something.

I offered to meet her in person today to talk things through, we arranged this yesterday after the ft , but we kept speaking after the ft yesterday and I had just answered every question to do with it: did you every love me ? Was I not enough for you ? Did I do something wrong? I was so kind and compassionate on the ft but firm in a loving way. My reasons are valid I know that I think. I don’t have time for someone atm and I’m not ready for a longer commitment.

I know that I u were there now I would just be re explaining everything over and over. I didn’t say this to her of course just that I had said everything. But I have crushed this girl , unexpected , over ft, and told her we should not talk for a while so we can heal, I even said a while after her birthday which is in a month.

I want someone cute, obsessed with me, and willing to take care of me—not because I need it, I'm already the breadwinner for my family, so I'm not expecting you to provide for me. But if you're the type who likes spoiling their person, I won't complain.

You should love food (I'm a foodie and create content about food and cheap travel) and coffee (because I can't live without it). You're kind, even to strangers. Patient— because I'm intense, I overthink, and I need someone who won't make me feel bad about it. You should be smart, passionate, and driven, but never condescending. Someone I can be silly with, but also feel safe and seen. I hope you're tall, good in bed, smells clean!! Should have BDE, I’m done fixing people, I’m here to be hyped up lol

I recently traveled to Vietnam, and I loved everything about it-especially the food and the vibes! So much so that I'm seriously considering living there for three months, maybe by the end of the year. Can you travel with me? I can work from anywhere, and I hope you can too, so we can see the world!

In bed? You can use me however you want. But more than anything, I crave attention, and cuddles! I want someone who makes me feel wanted, who makes me their person.
If that's you, let's talk. If not, just don't be unkind. <3

I have a whirlpool 4-door refrigerator - French doors with snack drawer and drawer freezer.

My fridge started to have a bit of a smell about 6-8 weeks ago, nothing bad. Sorta just smelled like leftovers not perfectly sealed. Not rotten, just there. I’m a single 33 year old, so the fridge stays pretty clean without little kids and other people around to spill things 

My brother was at my house about 4 weeks ago, and said that the water/ice from the fridge had an off taste. I had changed the filter early December, and change it regularly on auto ship from Amazon. He said the taste was so off that he would bring his own water next time, so I knew something was wrong. He and his fiancée said the smell was “rotten lettuce” but I don’t buy nor eat lettuce, so have never had any in the fridge. 

The smell is present in all parts of the fridge and freezer, and is worst in the area of the ice maker and in the ice itself. The water tastes fine 

I have done the following:

1. Removed everything and tossed anything expired
2. Cleaned with all purpose cleaner, bleach, vinegar (all separate times)
3. Removed all shelves, dividers, storage containers and cleaned with bleach and hot water
4. Changed the water filter
5. Cleaned condenser coils
6. Cleaned behind and under the fridge
7. Removed the back panel and cleaned the drip tray (some water here, but not smelly)
8. Tried multiple odor eliminators including coffee grounds, charcoal, baking soda, and a refrigerator ozone deodorizer
9. Removed and the cleaned the ice reservoir
10. Removed the ice maker and cleaned its housing 

It’s like the fridge is generating the smell. It’s not awful, not rancid. Just present and driving me insane. I have found no source 

Any ideas?

She and I work for the same company but in different non-interacting roles and in office spaces across the lobby from each other. We have never met or interacted in person or via email but we are physically in the same building several days a week. 

Another coworker has apparently complained to management about her using the women’s restroom on our floor. The complaining coworker was swiftly and firmly told to use a restroom on a different floor if they were uncomfortable. I have no idea if my trans coworker even knows about the complaint, but I hate that she may be feeling unwelcome here. I’d like to reach out to her in some way to introduce myself and just be friendly but I’m not sure how to approach without being awkward or overt about the situation. I’d love if we just casually ran into each other in the restroom or something, but I feel she may be avoiding interactions there and I don’t want to make her uncomfortable. 

Is there any not awkward/forced way for me to say hi and let her know she’s welcome here? I’ve thought about sending a gift card for coffee and a little note or maybe even just dropping her a TEAMS message (but seems inappropriate to use a work channel) but im not sure what to say. I’m such an introvert and worried about making her feel weird or drawing unnecessary attention to her if that’s not what she wants but I do want to let her know that there’s at least one ally and friendly face here.

I have a ton of service industry management experience, including being an SM at Casey's and a small business coffee shop. The past couple of years I've spent working in the political field, campaigns, government offices, etc. (I'm likely overqualified, but life unfortunately has not been kind, and I'm being forced to take a step back in my career)

What kind of questions can I expect and prepare myself for?

How is it being an ASM right now?

You're not alone. The key is to start small and focus on building habits to stick to. Here are nine tips to help you make real progress without feeling stressed:

1. **Start Your Day with Water** Drink a glass of water first thing in the morning. It kickstarts your metabolism and helps you stay hydrated throughout the day.
2. **Protein with Every Meal:** Add protein like eggs, chicken, or beans to each meal. This helps keep you full longer and reduces unnecessary snacking.
3. **Limit Processed Foods** Highly processed snacks and meals often contain empty calories. Opt for whole foods like vegetables, fruits, and lean proteins instead.
4. **Eat Slowly and Mindfully.** Savor your meals and take your time. Eating too quickly can lead to overeating before your body registers that it's complete.
5. **Swap Sugary Drinks** Replace soda or sugary coffee drinks with water, herbal tea, or black coffee. This small change can cut hundreds of calories weekly.
6. **Meal Prep for Success** Prepare your meals ahead of time to avoid unhealthy last-minute choices. It not only saves time but also keeps your goals on track.
7. **Include Healthy Fats** Don't fear fat! Avocados, olive oil, and chia seeds provide long-lasting energy and satisfy your meals.
8. **Set Realistic Goals** Focus on losing 1-2 pounds per week. Consistency beats crash diets every time.
9. **Personalize Your Plan** Not everyone's weight loss strategy will work for you. If you're considering keto, a **Custom Keto Plan** can be tailored to your body type and goals, making your weight loss more effective. Please look at how[ a Personalized Keto Plan Can Work for You](https://www.ketolifestyle.us/custom-keto-diet/).

Remember, small steps lead to significant results over time. Which tip are you most excited to try? Feel free to share your thoughts or any challenges—I'd love to help!",1,1742310425.0,HealthyWeightLoss,0,1.0,False

Last year I was struggling with constant spitting from nasal drip, and hoarseness... I went to an ENT, had an endoscopy, I have a deviated septum and they said some LPR. Mainly due to diet purposes (I am Italian...so a lot of red sauce). Was put on Omeprazole 40g for 30 days or something - and symptoms mainly went away. They checked up on me and everything looked great. She said to just maintain my diet. 

  
Last week I was struggling with my final exams for my grad degree so I consumed a large coffee (I never drink coffee) and then I consumed a lot of pizza and have been on a bit of a Guinness kick, so add 5 beers to that Friday night. My diet has not been great the last month or so either. 

  
I lost my voice for a few days - I guess from vocal cord irritation (I also coach soccer so I'm yelling out directions 5 days a week), and now I have a slight cough where I'm spitting out phlegm. I don't really feel sick, when I blow my nose, definitely nasal mucus or whatever it's called comes out. I can't tell if I'm sick, or if I had a flare up with my LPR, or if this is a combination of both. Anyone experience anything similar? 

Any advice on how to get rid of this cough? Finally slept through the night last night after a few days of waking up and coughing. My voice sounds great. Diet has been good so far. I just want to get back on the wagon. 

Thank you so much. ",1,1742310326.0,LPR,1,1.0,False

1je72zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1je72zy/feeling_abandoned_by_friends_after_my_mom_killed/,Feeling abandoned by friends after my mom killed herself,"Disclaimer: it's a really complicated situation and I'm having trouble making my thoughts clear, so sorry if it a bit long and confusing.
I'm 27, my mom killed herself last August, and since then not even one friend has stopped by my house, not even for a coffee. My mom lived in another country so when she killed herself, I stayed there for like a month and took care of everything with some help from my family. After that I stayed at my ex boyfriends house for another month (he lives in another city) before finally coming back home where I stayed with my best friend for like 1 week because I was also in the middle of moving, since the contract had been signed months prior to my mother's suicide. All of my childhood friends live in another country since I moved to another continent 8 year ago, so I don't have that many friends, I've known my (new) best friend for like 6 years and she has always been really nice, she helped me move and when I was taking care of my mother's affairs in another country she was constantly texting, which made me think that she was going to be really supportive when I came back home. For like the first month or something she was, then less and less. Everytime I wanted to talk about it she changed subjects or flat out tell me she couldnt handle me when I was angry ranting, told me to speak to other friends ( she knows I don't have many and this is not a subject I can just talk about with anyone) or to a therapist (I was seeing 2 at the time and she knew) or maybe even talk to my dad or brother(who are obviously having a horrible time too and I can't rely on them right now for support). But I AM angry, I'm angry my mom killed herself and left me alone, I'm angry that I had to take care of practically everything, I'm angry that no one is helping me out, but mostly I'm angry that I can't seem to talk to anyone (besides my therapist) about this without feeling like I'm bothering them. Sadly my reality sucks, right now, and I just want to unwind with my friends. Then, 4 months after my mom's suicide, my boyfriend dumped me. He had moved to another country just for a few months to make some money and come back, but i'm assuming that I also suffocated him, or at least that's how I felt. My grief got 1000 times worse and my friend got even more distant. I brought it up once and she said she was sorry and that she does get uncomfortable and doesn't know what to do, but nothing has really changed. She keeps texting sometimes to get coffee, but in HER work break, near to HER work (not close to my house) or maybe I'll tell her to meet up and she invites someone else along, never has she come once to my new apartment, made food for me, it always me who has gone to meet her where she is. (I think it's important to note that when she was going through a rough time about not knowing what to do with her life, I would many times go to her house and make lunch even if it wasn't near to my house at all) I was already a bit resentful since May last year, I was looking to move and so was she, but she didn't even consider moving with me even though she knows I have a hard time finding apartments since I also have an old dog with back problems, and most landlords won't accept me. She moved with her boyfriend (who is the person that introduced us, in fact when I first met her she was new here and had nowhere to stay and despite not knowing her I let her sleep in my house until she eventually moved in with me, just bc her bf at the time was my good friend) and they also.moved in with ANOTHER FRIEND we have in common who that have known only for 2 years max (he was her bf roommate),the apartment accepts dogs, and even has an extra room that they keep empty but not even once thought about offering it to me, even though they knew I was in a bad situation in my old place because the real state agency had slowly rented the 3 other rooms to 3 sixty year olds, at least 2 that were complete junkies, when it used to be a student apartement when I moved on. We fought but I ended up saying sorry cause it was selfish of me to think they should be thinking about me all the time, and just accept the fact that her boyfriend didn't want to live with a dog. I accepted it finally and moved on until all of this has brought I up again. Like a month ago I tried talking to another friend (her roommate, bc we are also good friends) just to complain about my ex dumping me at the worst time possible and he started ranting about me being selfish and victimizing myself, and not being the only one with problems, mind you this was the first time I was talking about this with him since like December when the relationship with my ex was getting rocky. It made me feel like shit. The worst part out of this is that my mom blamed me for her suicide in her note, basically  telling me she gave me everything and I gave nothing back, she was a druggadict and alcoholic, I know she was absolutely high and I know she didn't mean it cause she loved me, and was only angry at me because we had argued that morning about her drunk driving. But it really did a number on me, because of this I feel like I'm driving everyone away, and my mom was right, I suck, I'm a horrible person who thinks eveything revolves around her and my friends reacting like this means I deserve it. On the other hand I've become closer to my friend from school who are much younger, they're like 21 years old at best, but have really stepped up, they added me to their friend group and yesterday one of them even asked me if I wanted to move in with her next year since a room will be empty. I made sure to let them know about my dog and they didn't care at all. This really made me change perspectives about my other friends. So my message to the void 
is:  What do you think? Am I overreacting? Am I being self centered? Please I need to know. Its also important for me to note that lately when I bring it up she understands and doesn't take it personally, I think she wants to help but doesn't seem to know how or care that much to make and extra effort, just expects me to be able to discuss my issues like I was able to before. Sorry for the rant omg and please don't be afraid to be completely honest with me",4,1742310284.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False

1je71bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1je71bn/pulse_chapter_two/,"“Pulse,” Chapter Two","Chapter Two - “Pulse”:

Ray stepped out onto the pavement. 

The air was crisp, regulated beneath the dome's tempered glow. Around him, the city moved with quiet efficiency—trams gliding soundlessly along their tracks, the hum of distant turbines threading through the air.

A few passersby turned as he walked, some offering nods of recognition. A pair of students on a nearby bench glanced up from their tablets, their whispered exchange just faintly audible. Ray paid them little mind.

At the edge of the transit lane, a cab slowed to meet him, its polished surface reflecting the structured skyline. 

He stepped inside, and the door sealed with a near-silent hiss. The dashboard flickered on to display a smooth trajectory across the city.

Ray settled back, watching as the city unfurled outside the window. Towering structures of glass and steel curved into the sky, their surfaces shifting with dynamic solar panels. Bridges stretched across the city's canals, where the water ran dark and still, unbroken save for the controlled movements of filtration skimmers. 

The cab navigated through it all with quiet precision, each motion calculated, each turn anticipated.

At last, the headquarters of the Astronomic Science Authority came into view—its stark, angular silhouette cutting against the cityscape. 

The cab eased to a halt, and as Ray stepped out, he allowed himself a single breath.

Then, with confidence, he made his way inside.



The halls of the ASA hummed with quiet intensity, a steady undercurrent of conversation and distant machinery forming the pulse of the institution. 

Scientists moved with purpose, their voices low yet charged, exchanging theories, data, and half-finished thoughts as they passed between sterile glass-paneled laboratories. 

The walls bore digital readouts—equations, simulations, real-time telemetry—updating in smooth, flickering intervals.

Ray walked with measured purpose, shoulders squared, hands clasped before him. He gave brief nods of acknowledgment as he passed, but none thought to stop him. 

The halls pulsed with urgency—scientists moved briskly, some deep in murmured discussion, others frowning at data readouts while a few scratched notes onto clipboards. A few stood motionless in thought, staring past their own calculations. 

The ASA never truly stilled; minds worked even when bodies paused.

A glint of light caught his eye—his gaze flicked to a nearby lab. 

A scientist stood alone, unmoving, staring into the glow of a console. The screen's pale light reflected off his glasses, obscuring his expression. 

Though curious, Ray moved on.

As he neared his division, a sudden presence jolted into his path.

""Oh! Hello!"" The voice was bright, self-assured—perhaps overly so. The young woman before him stood with easy confidence, dressed in a manner that straddled professionalism and personal ease. ""You're Godfrey, yes?""

Ray barely opened his mouth before she pressed on.

""Good, good. Thought so. Which means I've found the right division, seeing as, well... you're here.""

Ray gave a slow, measured nod. ""Indeed. I received word from headquarters regarding your appointment. I am to—""

""Teach me, yes, yes—I know.""

The interruption was swift, almost instinctual—then a  flicker of embarrassment crossed her face, and when she caught Ray's expression, she faltered.

""O-oh, I, um—I didn't mean to—"" she straightened, exhaling sharply as if resetting herself. ""P-please, continue.""

She crossed her arms, her expression teetering between an apologetic grimace and an uneasy smile.

A brief silence stretched between them. Ray regarded her for a moment longer, then turned sharply on his heel.

""Come along now. There is much to learn.""



Ray strode through the division with efficiency, his gait swift yet unhurried. He moved not as a guide but as a man retracing familiar steps, pointing out key features as they passed.

""This corridor houses our primary computational systems—high-density quantum processors running near absolute zero. Processing cores are suspended in a vacuum chamber to prevent heat contamination. Here, the primary astrophysical simulations are conducted—gravitational lensing, dark matter distributions, orbital mechanics, all updated in real time.""

The newcomer trailed behind, nodding, though she had little time to process each detail before sidestepping an upcoming colleague.

Ray stopped abruptly at a glass partition, gesturing to the room beyond. ""That,"" he said, ""is the photonic spectrometer array. We extract data from deep-field observations, parse light signatures down to individual photons—useful for stellar composition analysis, exoplanet atmospheres, and—""

He pivoted before finishing, already moving again. The intern hurried to catch up, muttering under her breath.

He stopped at a smooth, circular indentation in the wall—no signage, no visible function. 

He ran a finger along its surface, nodding to himself before turning back.

""The entire facility is built upon a superconductor-laced substructure,"" he explained. ""Minimal energy loss. Even waste heat is siphoned into secondary systems—passive temperature regulation, water purification. Efficiency is paramount.""

She frowned. ""That... thing you just touched. What is it?""

Ray glanced at it again. ""Ah. A recessed access panel. Maintenance ports are hidden in plain sight—cleaner aesthetic.""

She raised an eyebrow. ""Concealing maintenance ports in the name of aesthetics... seems impractical.""

Ray resumed his brisk pace, weaving through the winding corridors, occasionally stopping to observe something only he seemed to find significant—a particular alignment of conduits, the faint hum of a cooling system, the way a readout flickered in a pattern imperceptible to most.

She fell behind again.

Then, a pause. Ray slowed, scanning the space for another point of interest. A moment of quiet settled between them.

She took the opportunity.
""Beatrice,"" she said simply.

Ray stopped mid-step, turning to her. ""... Surname?""

The question caught her off guard, but she recovered quickly. ""Whitmore. Beatrice Whitmore.""

Ray tilted his head slightly. He rather liked the name. ""Interesting. Miss Whitmore, then.""

Beatrice smirked. ""I'm a married woman, Mister Godfrey.""

Ray stiffened, and his eyes flickered. ""Oh... my apologies. I... assumed someone your age wouldn't have settled down yet.""

She scoffed. ""I'm twenty-four, for your information.""

Ray hesitated, then gave a short nod. ""Apologies, then.""

They continued walking.
Ray was noticeably slower.



After more walking, more of the intricacies of the Division, Beatrice stopped.

A light flashed bright from beyond a window overlooking the city below.

Beatrice stared, then interrupted Ray's guidance with, ""Isn't it mad? How light can come and go, yet never be truly destroyed?""

Ray halted mid-step. He hadn't expected her to say something of value.

""I mean, everything breaks down in the end, doesn't it? All matter will collapse, the stars will burn out, even the laws of physics might unravel one day. But light—once it's out there, it just keeps going. The only thing that can stop... I don't know—more light?"" She chuckled, pushing away from the window.

Ray studied her for a long moment, his expression unreadable. Then, finally, he spoke.

""It is an interesting thought."" A pause. ""I have considered the same.""

Beatrice turned to him, eyebrows raised. ""Oh, really? So I can hold a conversation with you, then.""

Ray exhaled—not quite amusement, but something close. ""Occasionally.""

Beatrice smirked, then turned back to the window. Ray lingered a moment longer before continuing forward.



Finally, after roughly two hours of guidance, Beatrice got the gist of the Division and they both went for a break in the main lobby.

""Well... I'll be processing that for a decade,"" Beatrice said, resting her face in her palms.

""I know, I know, it's much—even some people who have worked months here still come across new things.""

Ray then passed a cup of coffee over to Beatrice, who drank it immediately.

""I love it here,"" Ray said, looking around the place with reverence. ""Even five years later, I still find something new to learn, some new problem to solve. It just keeps giving.""

Familiarity settled in Ray's face. ""If you've got what it takes, if you've got the determination, you can do anything.""

Beatrice smiled, and, after a moment, nodded confidently.

Ray checked his wristwatch and exhaled softly. ""That will do for today. We'll resume tomorrow,"" he said. 

Then, fixing his gaze on Beatrice, he continued in a measured tone, ""But tonight, you remain for a preliminary trial—a test of the fundamentals of our division's operations.""

He gestured toward a nearby console displaying a streamlined interface. ""Your task is straightforward: verify the calibration of the photonic spectrometer array. Ensure its readings conform to our established baselines, then log the data accurately. Think of it as confirming the basics—the foundation upon which all our advanced analyses depend.""

His expression grew sterner. ""Any missteps won't just set you back—they'll reflect on me as well. But I've no doubt you'll handle yourself just fine.""

He started to turn away, then hesitated. His gaze flicked back to Beatrice, considering her for a moment longer than necessary.

""...You can do this.""


Ray stepped into the elevator, pressing a biometric panel with his thumb. A soft chime, then rapid descent. 

He barely felt the motion—magnetic acceleration made it near-instantaneous. 

Floors blurred past on the digital display, and within seconds, he reached the ground level. 

The doors whispered open, revealing the polished expanse of the ASA lobby.

He moved toward the exit, but just as he neared the glass doors, a figure stepped into his path.

Ray halted. Immediately, his posture shifted—straightening, hands clasping instinctively behind his back.

""Mr. Ford,"" he said, lifting his chin up slightly. ""A surprise, but never an unwelcome one. Something the matter?""

The man before him, Gregory Ford, was a veteran of the ASA—nearing fifty, but with the physique of a man who never truly stopped working. His grey-streaked hair was neatly combed back, his sharp eyes piercing into Ray.

""Mr. Godfrey,"" Ford said evenly, ""I apologize for delaying you, but I need you at Headquarters. Our chief scientist has reported something... unusual.""

Ray tensed. Ford did not use words like unusual lightly.

""... Could—could this not have been sent as a message?"" He hesitated, glancing at his watch. ""I need to return to my wife before nightfall—""

""I don't want any chance of my message being intercepted."" Ford's voice was firm, final.

Ray exhaled slowly, rolling his sleeve back down. 'Just a moment longer,' he told himself.

He allowed a brief, knowing smile before turning sharply on his heel. ""Come.""

Together, they crossed the lobby and stepped into another lift. This one was different—restricted access, destination locked. 

The moment the doors sealed, the floor rose beneath them, a sensation of controlled velocity. The ascent was smooth, but the sheer speed was undeniable.

Headquarters sat at the very top of the ASA complex. As the lift doors opened, Ray took a step inside—a stark, functional space, walls lined with high-resolution displays streaming real-time data from deep-space observation arrays. 

The lighting was subdued, designed to reduce eye strain during long hours of work. Desks curved seamlessly into integrated consoles, and a window overlooked the distant sprawl of buildings.

In the center of the room, a small office stood encased in reinforced glass. And inside, slumped over a cluttered desk, sat the head scientist.

Dr. Elias Monroe.

Ray had known him for years. He was not an excitable man. Yet even from a distance, it was clear—something had shaken him.

Ford strode forward and knocked twice on the office window. Monroe jumped, rubbing his temples before hurriedly ushering them in.

The office was dimly lit, paper notes scattered among holographic readouts. Monroe barely spared a greeting before diving straight in.

""I assume you've already briefed him?"" he asked Ford, voice tight with exhaustion.

""Not yet."" Ford folded his arms, giving Monroe space to explain.

The scientist exhaled sharply, nodding to himself as if ordering his thoughts. Then, he turned to Ray.

""We picked up something in deep space—an anomaly. A signal, rhythmic. But it doesn't match any known pattern—JX-914, I would guess.""

Ray's brow furrowed. ""JX-914?""

Monroe tapped a few keys on his console. A star map flickered on, pinpointing a location far beyond mapped territory.

""Interstellar void,"" Monroe muttered. ""No planets. No pulsars. Nothing but vacuum."" 

He rubbed his jaw, shaking his head. ""And yet, we detected something. Which raises the question... how could we still detect something that far away?""

Silence.

Ray stared at the data, mind already turning over possibilities.

A spark lit his eyes.

Jean-Marc Dupuis hadn’t taken a vacation in 5 years. Not since that day. He buried himself in work. That was one of the reasons Jorin approved his three day request. “It’s about time, Jean-Marc. I was wondering when you’d take some personal days,” he said as he clicked on the button to approve the request.

“Yes, well, I think it’s time for me to return to the world, I guess,” said Jean-Marc with a grim smile.

Next day, he was on a train to Rotterdam.

Finding the Linguistic Research Facility was easy enough. Finding Zuva’s office was a different matter entirely. Jean-Marc couldn’t use his official rank or clearance to ask for her, since he was supposedly on a vacation, and this would raise some red flags. So he just waited in a café outside the office, reviewing Zuva’s image on his phone. Hopefully, she had friends.

The brisk, morning sun was shining through the window pane, warming his arms, folded on the table as he was drinking his coffee, looking at the wooden panels on the wall, the small flower in a vase on his table, next to his cup, the morning patrons walking in and out, chatting about their day-to-day. Lena would like this. But he couldn’t think about that now. It was important to find Zuva.

Then it hit him. What if Zuva is anti-social? What if she never visited this café? What is this wild goose chase he let himself be dragged into?

He had to consider his next course of action if Zuva does not walk in.

Taking out his laptop, Jean-Marc established a secure connection again, now searching for Zuva Sigauke’s place of residence. Knowing the Terran Republic, she would be in one of the hundreds of apartments set up for personnel. Thankfully, his clearance enabled him to find all of them. This wouldn’t raise any suspicions since it would appear like he was searching for a place to stay. Benefit of being a Senior Intelligence Analyst, Level 4 was free use of Republic condos anywhere in the world.

Each of the apartments had a code in relation to the post. 12 apartments reserved for Linguistics personnel. 5 occupied. That narrowed it down.

As he looked up from his laptop, just about to ask for the check, there she was. Zuva Sigauke. Ordering a coffee. Sitting with a colleague.

The only thing left was approaching her.

He watched her every move silently as he pretended to continue his work. Finally, as she got up to leave, he approached the barista, paying for his coffee, and, turning around, bumped her purse, making it fall to the ground. He picked it up and returned it.

“Thank you,” Zuva said.

“The translation is a lie,” Jean-Marc replied.

Upon hearing those words, Zuva made an unconscious jerk backwards. “Where did you hear that?”

Jean-Marc glanced to Zuva’s companion, then back to Zuva. She turned to her colleague, and said with a smile, “Wait for me outside, I won’t be long.”

The colleague out of the way, Jean-Marc whispered, “Not here. Meet me,” he took out his phone and pointed to a pin on the map, “there at 1900. You know where that is?”

Zuva nodded.

“Good. See you this evening.”

Zuva got out of the café to an incredulous looking colleague. Jean-Marc could see the words “What was that?” on their lips, but he couldn’t make out a response. Hoping he wouldn’t get in trouble, he got out of the café.

The location of their meet was a very isolated little bar on the edge of town. Jean-Marc sat in a booth of the smoke-filled bar, sipping on his beer, when he saw Zuva standing in front of him.

“Please, sit down. I hope I haven’t disturbed you much this morning.”

“Disturbed?” Ziva asked as she was taking her place in the booth. “Why would I be disturbed by a stranger coming up to me, telling me a sentence I hadn’t heard in years?” She asked in an exaggerated tone of voice. “Not to mention the fact I had to lie to my roommate, the one you saw me with this morning, that I was going on a date with you.”

“So you know what it means?” Jean-Marc asked, worried if he hadn’t given away his complete lack of understanding the situation.

“What what means? Oh, the sentence. Of course I know it. The whole London group knows it,” Zuva exasperatedly replied.

“London group?” Jean-Marc asked, lifting his eyebrows.

“Yes, the group of linguists I met at Harvard. We were all young and naive, obsessed with language. We called ourselves the ‘London group’ since we all wanted to visit London at one point,” Zuva replied.

“And this… London group. You did independent research?” Jean-Marc’s next question was straight to the point.

“Yes. We were all top of our class at our respective languages. The ‘African expert’, they called me,” Zuva replied. “We were young, we wanted to make a significant breakthrough. So we started to research the Dhov’ur language. Trying to find connections with our own. We started from a simple premise: The translation is a lie.”

“Why did you have that premise?” Jean-Marc asked, leaning in.

“Several of us found inconsistencies with the current public dictionary. Things that did not make logical sense in regards to the imagery presented. You must understand, we were young, we wanted to make a difference.”

“You keep saying that,” Jean-Marc replied. “’We were young’. You said it a third time already. Like it’s an excuse.”

“Well, you would have an excuse as well if you saw your friend beaten up by an unknown agent for even suggesting such a thing,” Zuva almost whispered. “Two of our group, the best and the brightest, disappeared. We never heard from them again. After that happened, we agreed to bury the research.”

Jean-Marc blinked, then swallowed. Then exhaled, his pupils narrowing. He took a sip of his beer, and said, “Your research is why I’m here, I guess.”

The waiter brought Zuva her own drink, a Mojito. Waiting until the waiter got out of ear-shot, Jean-Marc continued.

“I have recently been contacted by what seems to be an interested party, and they led me to you.”

“Interested party? What do you mean?” Zuva asked, her eyebrows narrowed.

“They call themselves Echo. They sent me a message stating ‘The translation is a lie.’ That brought me to you,” Jean-Marc finished.

“Do you have a habit of visiting foreign cities based on cryptic messages sent by strangers?” Zuva asked, sipping her Mojito.

“Usually I wouldn’t be, but Echo gave me proof. That same evening, there was a news report which was almost word-for-word with… another, done 5 years ago.”

Zuva arched her eyebrows, tilted her head, and said, “Still, it’s a bit of a stretch.”

“Not given the nature of my work,” said Jean-Marc.

Zuva looked at him, forehead wrinkled, like she was trying to make sense of this whole situation.

Jean-Marc continued, “Given your research, if I showed you some footage, would you be able to give me an alternative translation of it?”

Zuva paused, then replied, “Yes, I think I would be able to. We buried the research, so I would need some time to get the dictionary, but I think I could present you with the translation.”

Jean-Marc placed a thumb-drive onto the table. “This is the footage. It took a great risk for my personal well-being to extract it from my workplace, and you might find the footage disturbing. But please, this is most important. Please see what you can do.”

Zuva precariously took the thumb-drive and placed it in her pocket. “How do I reach you?”

Jean-Marc took out his personal phone, and asked for Zuva’s number. “I am going to send you a message over a secure, encrypted channel. This is where you can find me, day or night.”

As her phone chimed, Zuva glanced at the screen, then nodded at Jean-Marc. “I’ll… See what I can do.”

Jean-Marc replied, “Thank you.”

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

The good news? Small changes can lead to significant results over time. Here are five simple, science-backed hacks to help you build momentum without feeling overwhelmed:

1. Start with a Balanced Breakfast Give your metabolism a boost by having a breakfast packed with protein and healthy fats. This will keep you full and help control cravings. Think eggs, avocado toast, or a veggie-packed smoothie.
2. Cut Liquid Calories Drinks like sodas, juices, and coffee loaded with sugar can sneak in hundreds of calories without filling you up. Swap them for water or herbal teas, and watch the difference they make over the weeks.
3. Eat More Mindfully Slow down during meals, chew thoroughly, and savour your food. This simple habit can prevent overeating and help you listen to your natural hunger cues.
4. Move More Throughout the Day You don’t need a gym membership to burn calories. Walk during lunch breaks, stretch while watching TV, or take the stairs instead of the elevator. Every bit of movement adds up.
5. Try a Personalized Keto Plan Not all diets are created equal. A *customized keto plan* can make your weight loss feel smoother by delivering personalized meals that fit your body and lifestyle. Curious to see how it could work for you? [Get Your Custom Keto Plan Here](https://www.ketolifestyle.us/custom-keto-diet/).

I’m currently working on putting together a unique cocktail to run on our specials card (Spanish Tapas restaurant). Last time I was in Barcelona I had a phenomenal cocktail with goat cheese infused tequila and it’s haunted me ever since. I’m trying to do something similar. However, in straining the cheese out, I lost approximately 50% of the tequila as well. I’ve done fat washes before where I lost 25-30% of the base liquor but 50% seems crazy. Am I doing something wrong? 

My technique has been:

-mix goat cheese with tequila (this batch had 2 cups tequila to 2/3 cup goat cheese)
-shake it lightly in the container until goat cheese is completely dissolved
-refrigerate 48 hours
-freezer for 12 hours
-strain with two extra fine cheesecloths 
-strain the resulting infusion with a coffee filter
-lose half the liquor lol

I have a small coffee YouTube channel where I document my morning pour-overs, and today’s video is dedicated to New Zealand. I had the chance to visit a while back, and I absolutely fell in love with the country — the people, the culture, and of course, the amazing coffee scene. To celebrate, I featured a special guest in this video: my beloved kiwi plushie, a souvenir from my trip that brings back so many fond memories.

What struck me most about New Zealand is the deep love Kiwis have for their homeland. Whether it was conversations with locals, stories shared over a flat white, or just observing the care and pride people have for their communities, it left a lasting impression on me. That passion is inspiring, and it made me want to capture a little piece of that in my coffee routine.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Creating beautiful ice cream swirls can turn a simple dessert into a stunning centerpiece. If you want to know how to create perfect ice cream swirls, you’re in the right place! Whether you’re aiming for a rich fudge ribbon, fruity bursts, or a playful mix of colors, the techniques in this guide will elevate your ice cream making game.

### Understanding the Basics of Ice Cream Marbling

Freezing temperatures can be tricky with ice cream. When working with different flavors or colors, it's essential to start with the right base. Aim for a well-churned, smooth ice cream as your main layer. This gives you a stable canvas for your swirls.

Next, consider your swirl mix-ins. You can use sauces, purees, or a variety of toppings to create your unique designs. Here are a few popular options:

- Chocolate fudge sauce
- Caramel sauce
- Fruit purees like raspberry or mango
- Nut butters

### Choosing the Right Temperature

Temperature plays a critical role in achieving the perfect marbling effect. Ideally, your ice cream mixture should be at a soft-serve consistency when you start swirling. This allows the mix-ins to blend beautifully without being too runny or too firm.

Keep your swirl mix-ins chilled but not frozen solid. If they are too cold, they won’t blend well with the ice cream; if they are too warm, they’ll melt too quickly. Aim for a harmonious balance!

### Techniques for Swirling Ice Cream

Now that you have your ice cream ready, it's time to create those stunning swirls. Here are several effective techniques to master the art:

- **Layering Method:** Begin by scooping a layer of ice cream into your container. Then add a layer of your chosen swirl mix-in. Repeat this process until your container is full. Use a knife or spatula to gently fold the layers, creating swirls without mixing everything together.
- **Spiral Technique:** Pour your swirl mix-in in a spiral motion directly over the ice cream. Using a skewer or a knife, gently drag it through the ice cream in a circular motion. This technique helps create beautiful, defined swirls.
- **Figure-Eight Motion:** After you've added your mix-ins, use the back of a spoon or spatula to create figure-eight motions through the ice cream. Make sure not to over-mix; you want to see distinct ribbons of flavor.

### Perfecting the Look

Once you’ve achieved the desired swirl effect, it's time to focus on presentation. An appealing look can significantly enhance the dessert experience. Consider the following tips:

- **Serving Size:** Use a small scoop to serve individual portions. This allows guests to enjoy the mixed flavors in every bite.
- **Topping Enhancement:** Garnish your swirled ice cream with additional toppings. Consider sprinkles, nuts, or extra chocolate chips to add texture and flavor.
- **Use Clear Containers:** If possible, display your ice cream in clear containers. This way, the beautiful swirls are visible, inviting people to dig in!

### Storing and Enjoying Your Swirled Ice Cream

After creating your masterpiece, storing it properly will help maintain its texture and flavor. Make sure to cover your ice cream container tightly with plastic wrap or a lid to prevent freezer burn. Enjoy your ice cream creation within a few weeks for the best taste and texture.

Remember, practice makes perfect! Don't hesitate to experiment with flavors. Try different combinations of ingredients to discover the sensational swirls that excite your taste buds. Whether you're whipping up a classic chocolate and vanilla mix or a more adventurous flavor, mastering ice cream swirls will surely impress your family and friends.

Exploring Creative Flavor Combinations for Stunning Ice Cream Swirls
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Ice cream is a canvas for creativity, and making stunning swirls takes it to the next level. The secret lies not just in the technique, but also in the flavor combinations you choose. When you explore unique and tasty flavors, each swirl becomes an art piece that’s a delight for both the eyes and the palate. Here are some exciting creative flavor combinations that can elevate your ice cream swirls.

### Classic Pairings with a Twist

Combining familiar flavors with a surprising twist can create a memorable ice cream experience. Here are some unexpected pairings to try:

- **Chocolate and Orange:** The rich, creamy chocolate pairs beautifully with the bright, zesty notes of orange. Marbling these flavors makes for a visually stunning and refreshing treat.
- **Mint and Lavender:** Mint provides a cool freshness while lavender adds a floral touch. The combination creates a soothing and aromatic ice cream swirl.
- **Cherry and Almond:** The tartness of cherries contrasts nicely with the nutty flavor of almonds. Swirling them together not only looks beautiful but tastes fantastic, evoking a classic cherry almond cake.

### Fruit Fusion Creations

Fruits can add vibrant colors and natural sweetness to your ice cream swirls. Here are some fruit combinations that are worth exploring:

- **Raspberry and White Chocolate:** The tartness of raspberries beautifully complements the creamy sweetness of white chocolate. This flavor combination creates striking red and white marbling.
- **Pineapple and Coconut:** Go for a tropical twist with sweet pineapple and rich coconut. This duo not only tastes like summer, but the swirls also look inviting and cheerful.
- **Mango and Passion Fruit:** Mango provides a rich base, while passion fruit adds a tangy kick. These flavors not only blend well but also create an eye-catching orange-yellow swirl.

### Decadent Dessert Blends

Sometimes, you want to capture the essence of beloved desserts in ice cream form. Consider these combinations that evoke classic desserts:

​ Shop Here --&gt; https://www.ice-cream-101.com ​  
  
- **Cookies and Cream with Peanut Butter:** The crunch of cookies combined with smooth peanut butter creates a dynamic texture and flavor experience. Each swirl will capture the best of both worlds.
- **Tiramisu and Hazelnut:** This rich blend brings coffee, chocolate, and hazelnut together. You’ll be reminded of the classic Italian dessert while enjoying a creamy swirl.
- **Brownie Batter and Mint:** Combining sweet brownie batter with mint-flavored ice cream brings a delightful mix of flavors and textures. The dark chocolatey swirls give a stunning visual appeal.

### Spicy and Savory Fusions

If you’re feeling adventurous, try incorporating spice into your ice cream swirls. Here are some bold flavor combinations:

- **Chili Chocolate:** Adding a hint of chili to rich chocolate ice cream creates a unique flavor sensation that’s sure to surprise and delight.
- **Cardamom and Pistachio:** Cardamom brings warmth and complexity, while pistachio lends a nutty flavor. Together, they make a lovely blend with a hint of elegance.
- **Ginger and Mango:** The warm spiciness of ginger pairs wonderfully with the sweetness of mango, creating a swirl that’s bursting with flavor and has a nice kick.

### Creating the Perfect Swirl

Once you've decided on your flavor combinations, the next step is to create that perfect swirl. Here are some tips to achieve the best marbling:

- **Chill Your Ingredients:** Make sure both your ice cream and the flavor components are well-chilled. This helps to create distinct swirls rather than fully blending the flavors.
- **Layer Effectively:** Start by layering your base ice cream and your flavor in a container. Use a spatula or a knife to gently swirl through the layers without over-mixing.
- **Be Mindful of Texture:** Consider the texture of your swirl ingredients. Chunky items like fruit pieces or nuts can add visual appeal and deliver bursts of flavor in every bite.

With these creative flavor combinations and swirling techniques, you have the tools to make your ice cream truly stand out. Experiment, have fun, and let your imagination guide you! Each scoop can become a masterpiece, reflecting your personal taste and style. Happy swirling!

### Conclusion

Creating the perfect ice cream swirls is a delightful journey that combines both artistry and culinary skill. By mastering various techniques such as the simple fold-and-mix method or the more intricate ribbon technique, you can ensure that each swirl preserves its flavors and adds visual appeal to your treat. Remember that the temperature of your ice cream plays a crucial role; working with slightly softened ice cream allows for easier marbling, resulting in defined shapes.

As you explore creative flavor combinations, don’t hesitate to let your imagination run wild. Pair unexpected flavors like honey lavender with dark chocolate or pistachio with raspberry. These combinations not only surprise the palate but also create stunning visuals in your swirls. Play with textures by adding crunchy elements like cookie crumbles or nuts, which can enhance the experience of each bite.

i was thinking about getting one of those water fountains but im not sure because i dont think she necessarily prefers running water. like when she used to drink out of the sink it wasnt when the sink was on. it could also be a whisker fatigue thing and she only drinks out of cups because shes weird.

does anyone know what her deal is or any good cat fountains/bowls she might like?",0,1742309092.0,CATHELP,8,0.33,False

For context, he was divorced when we got together, and early on, I noticed red flags regarding his communication with his ex-wife. I won’t go into too much detail, but some examples include withholding information about their conversations, planning coffee meet-ups without telling me, and calling me ""crazy"" for being concerned.

Despite these issues, the first couple of years were smooth, and we started planning a future together. In 2022, he proposed, and I was thrilled—so I thought.

A few months later, just a week before my competition, he suddenly told me, *""Something is telling me I have to go back to my ex-wife.""* It was like my worst fears were manifesting right in front of me, and I had no idea how to process it. I left and stayed at a friend's house that night.

When I returned home the next morning, he told me, *""I didn't mean it. I was processing a ‘spiritual experience’ I had and spoke without thinking it through.""* But the damage was done. I told him we were over, left for my competition, and made plans to move out when I got back.

I was a wreck at my competition, utterly heartbroken. When I returned, I moved out, got my own place, and was single for a couple of months. But we couldn’t seem to stay away from each other and eventually found our way back together.

This time, we knew things had to be different. We had long conversations, set clear boundaries, and carefully planned how we were going to rebuild trust. The biggest boundary I set was that he needed to cut contact with his ex-wife so I could feel secure in our relationship. I made it clear that if he broke that boundary, there would be no coming back from it. He agreed without hesitation, and over the next couple of years, we actually grew closer.

In 2024, we got engaged again and started planning our wedding. I really thought we had made it.

Fast forward to a week before my next competition—he dropped two bombs on me.

1. *""I don’t know if I want kids anymore.""* (Which we had already agreed on before getting engaged.)
2. *""I’m leaving for a month to work on a project.""*

I was upset and confused, but I asked if we could table the conversation until after my competition. Once the competition was over, he left for his trip. While he was gone, we kept in touch through texts and phone calls.

One night, during a call, he seemed off. I asked him three times what was wrong, and each time he insisted, *""Nothing.""* The next day, he called me and confessed, *""I talked to (ex-wife) a couple of times while I was here.""*

All I said was, *""Then we’re done. That was my one boundary,""* and I hung up, absolutely defeated.

When he came home two weeks later, we finally had a conversation. One of his main arguments was that it *""wasn’t fair of me to ask him not to speak to her in the first place,""* and that *""it was my fault for making that boundary in the first place.""*

So… AITA for asking my fiancé to cut contact with his ex-wife?",79,1742309029.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,88,0.95,False

Please take my work for what I'm eating. I'd honestly rather you just tell me something is wrong and that I should go to the doctor than tell me I'm lying about what I'm eating.

5'4F. Started at 252, currently at 243. Working out on Echelon bike for 30-40 minutes. Sleeping 6-7 hours a day. Bowel movements happen maybe once every 2-3 days, but I try to take a laxative on Sundays to help clean me out.


Thanks for your help! So this will be the third week I have been serious about losing weight. Week 1, was going through a very rough patch in my marriage and didn't have an appetite. Would Basically drink coffee before working out and that was all for the day. Worked out doing 30 minutes of dance (Youtube: Fitness Marshall). I lost 6 lbs that week.


Week 2, better place in marriage so eating resumed but I was on a diet. 1 banana for breakfast, 1 banana for lunch, coffee (140 cal) before workout, portioned out Taco Salad for dinner (500 cal) and a Breyers Ice cream snack cup for dessert (90 cal). So about 940calories a day. I switched my workout to the Echelon bike for 30 minutes (resistance changing between 13 and 20, depending on the song). While my legs had gotten super toned, I realized at my daily weigh ins I was gaining like half a pound a day. I did not lose weight this week. Ended up gaining pound and a half.


Week 3 (this week), my diet will consist of 2 eggs and 2 sausage Links for breakfast (260cal), peanut butter Crackers for lunch (200cal), coffee for preworkout/snack (140cal), Taco Salad for dinner (500cal), breyers ice cream Cup for dessert (80cal). Total 1190cal. I increased my bike Workout from 30 minutes to 45 minutes yesterday, and still with all that, I woke up today to being half a pound more than I was yesterday.


I'm not trying to go another week not losing weight. Not even maintaining my weight, but gaining. I enjoy my bike workouts but my theory is its making me gain muscle in my legs and thus, I'm not losing weight. I'm not confident about that, but I just know something has to be up. Please let me know your theories.

Right now, I'm thinking I might just return to my dance workout because I lost weight while doing it, even in the past. As much as I like the Echelon bike, I'm not losing weight for some reason. ",0,1742308825.0,loseit,25,0.09,False

I drank it, cooked with it—never had any major issues. But a while back, I visited a friend’s place, and their water tasted *so* much cleaner than mine. That’s when I started wondering if I had just gotten used to mediocre water quality.

I did a little research, and apparently, even if your city’s water is “safe,” it can still have a ton of stuff in it—chlorine, heavy metals, even microplastics (which freaked me out a bit). I looked into filters, but I didn’t want one of those huge bulky systems, and pitcher filters just seemed annoying.

Eventually, I came across [Waterdrop Filter](https://www.waterdropfilter.com/) while reading about under-sink systems. Never heard of them before, but the reviews were solid, and it seemed like a good balance between cost and effectiveness. I installed one a few weeks ago, and I can *actually* taste the difference. Water is smoother, no weird chlorine smell, and my coffee somehow tastes better too? Didn’t expect that, but I’m not complaining.

I used to be in chorus but I dropped it when I moved schools because my new school didn't have a music program. I like to game, I love playing the sims 4 and minecraft. I've played other games on playstation but I mostly just use pc now. 

  
I fell I love with someone 4 years ago and I'm just now starting to recover from that, ask me about it.

  
I'd prefer to hand write, but I'm not sure about that because I don't want to give just anyone my address lol like I said I'm new, I'm not sure how this all works.

*Date [standardized human time]: October 30, 2136*

It was snowing when Mason and I left for the space port. fat white clusters that fell in slow swirling patterns onto the green grass and melted into slush on contact. I held my paw out and caught one on my palm pad. 

We almost never got snow in Starside. It could be quite chilly when the sun was down, but it was usually because of the rainstorms the great air current caused. 

“It's human tradition to catch them on your tongue. Not sure these ones would be safe though.” The stocky human called from the opened garage. 

I watched as the clump of spindles and prisms melted into a drop of water with a swirl of black soot particles swimming through it. I grunted and flicked it off my pad. 

An engine roared to life, and Mack's sleek angular car prowled forward out of the garage. Its body was long and painted a deep red-orange that glittered when light hit it directly. Except the door where vemnka had scraped it off with the runabout cart. I could see the streak of paint transfer on the cart's bumper from out here.  

“You can sit in Mack's car while it auto drives, or join me.” He gestured to his own car. It was… Much less impressive than Mack's swooped growling beast. 
 It was a big black rectangle of a vehicle, a near spitting image of some of the primitive vehicles I had seen in the show last night. It stood out from those by being covered in strange technological attachments and glow in the dark stickers. Water collectors sprouted from each back window, and a big dish radar sat on the roof, alongside what looked like a lighting rod. 

“Will that thing even manage to haul the both of us with all that?” I gestured at the boxy car and the random speh attached to it.

Mason smiled, it was closed lipped and immensely smug. 

“Oh my baby isn't the prettiest girl at the dance, but she'll put out the second you ask her.” He pulled open the driver's side door and jammed the key in. My ears slapped down to my head as the car roared to life. I kept them folded as I climbed into the passenger seat. The sound was muted inside, but I could feel the rumble through my legs and paws. 
Mason stroked one of the glowing displays. A strange cluster of displays grew from the dashboard. Glass tube displays next to liquid crystal panels, with flatscreens stuck wherever they could fit.  It felt almost anachronistic, but the aesthetics of human technology evaded me. 

“Ten cylinder, alcohol fueled, I won’t bore you with jargon but she outputs 600 horsepower on a good day.”

Not sure what a horse was, but 600 was an appreciably high number. I decided to let Vemnka ask the technical questions, and instead prodded the human for a reaction. “Think it could beat Mack's car to the spaceport?” 

The fake faced man laughed and pulled out of the garage. He tapped on his consoles and Mack's car pulled up to the opening gate. 

“Oh yeah, the autopilot drives like a damn Flatlander. Doesn’t know any of the good routes.” He answered as he watched the car head for the road up out of the valley.

Just as I opened my mouth to ask what “Flatlander” meant, Mason's boot hit the floor and his hand hit the radio. I was forced into the squidgy seat cushions by the acceleration as we peeled out of the garage and took off in the *opposite* direction. 

Around the other side of the valley the smooth pavement of Mack's compound ended and was replaced by a rough backwoods access road. A simple chainlink auto-gate that barely managed to open before we tore through the gap.

Mason was relaxed as he drove, one arm on the wheel, the other draped across the headrest with casual disregard for the reckless speed as we tore down the narrow mountain road. His confidence was catching, and I found myself relaxing into the vast bench seat and enjoying the ride. 

The scenery whipped by as we rocketed down the dirt road. Jagged, forest covered ridges of purple-black rock climbed up the mountain to our right. To the left was a solid wall of trees, broken up by the occasional clearing cut into the ancient woods to create space for a cabin, or powerstation or some other out-building I couldn't divine the purpose of. All of it gradually being colonized by millions of the flakes whose kin had earlier melted on my palm.

“Ssssooo, I've got an awkward question for you.” Mason straightened up in his seat, one multi-lensed eye turning to focus right on me while the other stayed on the road. 
I mirrored his more serious posture and steadied myself against the interior of the car as the back end demolished a low hanging tree branch as we drifted around a corner. 

“Awkward in what way?”  I asked, breaking eye contact with his slightly unnerving Harchen stare for a moment to make sure the branch we picked up hadn’t speared through a window. 

We pulled up to an intersection with a regular tarmac road and stopped. Mason took a deep breath while another driver passed in front of us. “What do you know about what happened to Erich? They didn't tell us much.” 

*Ah, that kind of awkward. As if getting bombarded with insane messages from Hecate all night wasn't enough.*

Hesitation hung heavy across my normal forthright outlook. “He threw himself off of an overlook near our home shortly after the news reached us.” Eventually flowed out of my mouth. 

*No harder than massaging the truth for a reporter.*

“Where were you?” 

My mouth went dry. I told Sevkan that if I was pressed about this I would not lie, but now that I was confronted with it, I hesitated again. 

“I had just got home from work. I…” I struggled to find words that wouldn't fracture my burgeoning friendship with the large man. “I did not understand what was happening in time to help. I think my attempt may have made things worse.” 

“Well, I appreciate that you tried.” The large man let out a resigned sigh and turned onto the road. 

*Did I? Really?* 

Desperate for something else to talk about, I cast my eye out across the landscape. Way off on the high peak opposite to us, a rounded grey dome cut into the top of treeline.

“What is that, out there?”

I pointed at the structure.

Mason glanced at it, then back to the road. 

“That's Kings peak observatory. Biggest telescope on this half of the continent up there.” His eye shifted over to look at me. “Fan of stargazing, Mr. Kim?”

Warmth spread through my chest, and my memory jumped to the ruined foundations of ancient Observatories that studded the high hilltops of Starside. 

“I am. All of our ground based observatories were torn out by the time I was born.” I could not hide the mournful edge to that statement. 

Mason's face scrunched up with disapproval. “Fucken Feds, gonna be digging through the layers of their bullshit for *centuries* at this point.”

“What?”

“Have you not been keeping up with the news? The broadcast that camo-lizard made with that big honcho squid-frog?”

“...What?”

“You should really give that a watch. Anyway, you should ask Mack to take you out there for a tour.” 

“He's friends with the operator, tried to foist a cybernetic restoration on one of their staff?” I hazarded. 

Mason laughed. “Close! We filmed the music video for *Panther of Midnight* up there, and last I checked, all their staff had factory preset parts.” 

The domed roof of the observatory sank behind the ridge of black rock as we descended towards the shoreline. 

Turns out Mason was correct, as we merged onto the main road I could see the distinct headlight pattern of Andre's car further up the mountain. 

We arrived at the spaceport a few minutes later. Mason threw the accessory laden wagon into a skid and we came to a stop with a spray of loose gravel. 

We made our way into the spaceport and made ourselves comfortable in the waiting lounge. It did not take me long to figure out the workings of the coffee machine, and by the time the shuttle had landed the caffeine had soaked into my nerves and chased away the early waking slowness. 

I found my way to the tiny lounge that took up a quarter of the equally tiny spaceport and settled into one of the comfortable chairs. 

Mason decided to pass the time by falling asleep in one of the chairs, so I kept myself entertained by watching one of the videos the Librarian had added to my queue. 

Mack had made a hobby of replicating armour and cybernetics from media he enjoyed and filming the process. This particular one was specifically about the set of chainsaw limbs I had seen in the security footage. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it. While the videogame the chainsaw limbs idea came from was almost comically gruesome, Mack's approach was the exact opposite. 

His ‘On camera’ personality was as easy going and prone to technical explanations as he normally was, and the snappy edits between calculations, timelapses of fabricators at work and a sizzle reel of gameplay came together in an engaging way. 15 minutes in, the build was done, and things moved to the testing phase. Which was composed entirely of Satoshi and Matt throwing fruits and vegetables from the greenhouse at Andre while he tried to swat at them with the unwieldy limb mounted saws. The saws performance didn’t impress me. In the game they turned the player into a whirlwind of death, in real life…

Andre could reliably bat the fruit away, but making the saws compact enough to fit inside limbs meant they were small, and often couldn’t cut through whatever chunk of plant had been thrown. The highlight of this was a moment where Matt threw something labelled a ‘butternut squash’ at Andre. His leg snapped up, but instead of bisecting the gourd the saw just imparted a spin and the oblong vegetable tumbled right into Andre’s groin in slow motion. 

He let out a wheeze and fell off-camera. Matt wandered over and looked down at his obscured brother. “Why the hell does a crotch shot even hurt you?” His voice sounded so much like Mack’s. 

“It’s the principal of it!” Groaned Andre, his tone absent of any sass. 

“Then why aren’t you wearing a jock?”

“...Shutup, I’m older than you!” 

Matt turned to look directly into the camera, which slowly zoomed in on his absolutely unamused expression until his entire face filled the screen. I barely managed to contain my laughter as I remembered all the times I had seen Sevkan make that exact kind of face at his sister. 

Half an hour later the muted roar of engines cut through my headphones and interrupted my viewing. Mason stirred at the noise and blinked away his blearly post nap haze as he fished out a folded cardboard sign with something vulgar on it. He wandered over to the gate to wait.

Vemnka was first through the gate. She bounded her way across the arrivals lounge and crashed into my arms with a cheerful “Hey Dad!”  

“Vemnka, I trust you had a good time putting that new suit through it's paces.” I prodded the patch of medigel on her chest. 

She let out a wildly exaggerated squeak of pain and shot me an equally unconvincing 'pitty me’ look. But before she could protest, Andre's distinctly flanged voice cut in. 

“That was absolutely her fault, before she starts playing the blame game.” I had to actively maintain control over my tail as the sight of the lanky mechanical human cheered me up more than I had anticipated. 
 
“Oh, I have no doubt about that.” I tussled the enormous pouf of Vemnka's wool and shot her a knowing look. “Plus she already told me what happened.” 

“We agreed to tell him together, so he'd probably not want to kick my ass.” Andre sputtered and furrowed his brow at my mischievous daughter, who again was attempting her pity me look. 

“I was too excited! It was too cool to not share! You had a phonecall anyway! IthinkVilsaneedsmuhelpbye!” Vemnka extricated herself from my hug and boinged over to the check in counters to help a braided grey venlil. She brushed past Andre on her way over with a cheeky flap of her ears.

Andre scowled back at her, grumbling.
“You are so pranked Baa-Baa Blacksheep!” 

Vemnka’s giggling trailed off into the distance, leaving me alone with Andre.

“Sooo…. Do I get a hug now?” He asked, that charming half smile creeping up one side of his face. 

I set my ears in challenge and flicked my tail. “I thought you were concerned with being in ass-kicking range?” 

Andre chuckled and stepped in a little closer. “Can't really kick me when I've grappled you.”

“Are you willing to bet another sternum bruise on that notion?” I drummed my toe talons on the floor, drawing his attention to the paw that I'd planted in the centre of his chest the other day. 

Before the cocky metalman could retort another, distinctly feminine voice cleared their throat. Both of us turned to look at the source. 

She was a sharp edged woman about the same height as myself, the hard lines of command worn into her face and bearing were made severe by the distinct expression of impatience. 

“Hey, Mr. Rockstar, think you could introduce me to your friend here, before the two of you start snuggle fighting?” She asked, her face softening as she looked at me. 

“Oh right, yeah.” Andre cleared his throat, and looked slightly pinker than normal. “Captain Emily Chan of the istomeini, please meet Captain Kimmich of the Venlil Space Corps, and the Starside cops too!”

I stepped forward and offered my paw to Captain Chan, she joined her hand with it and we shook. “Well met, Captain. I trust my daughter and… specialist.. Fit in well with your crew?” 

Chan's sour expression inverted and she gripped my paw with respectable strength. “The Gadget Inspector over there fit in almost *too* well.” 

Andre put his hand to his chest and feigned offense, seemingly unaware we all knew what he got up to.

Chan rolled her eyes with exaggerated annoyance and crossed her arms at him before turning back to me. ”Your daughter proved to be a valuable member of the team, even with our initial bit of friction.” 

It was my turn to laugh. “Hit you with one of her 'I am very brave and you should take me seriously.” speeches, did she?” 

“That she did! And she proved it with how well she handled that impact.” I saw her eyes wander over to Vemnka and the bandage on her chest. I suppose I should not have been surprised that a human captain would be as concerned for their alien crew as I would be, but I was, and I felt guilty for it. 

“Yeah, she's a real trooper.” Andre interjected. Vemnka had told me about how quickly he had acted, guiding her into a breathing exercise before her suit could provide first aid. 

Warm pride filled my chest. “Yes, I'm quite proud of her.” I said, a little louder than normal. I saw her ears twitch with controlled flattery from across the room. “I have no doubt that new suit of hers contributed a great deal as well.” 

Andre's half smile changed, it spread to both sides of his face and relaxed, the colour of his face going just a smidge warmer. 

*That's more of a reaction than expected. Either complimenting his work is an easy way to gain favour or it meant more coming from me.*

Captain Chan's eyes threatened to roll again, and her mouth opened. Probably to make another joke, but Andre was quicker on the draw. 

“Speaking of suits! Me and Sev gotta get the captain here ready for her leg replacement. How about you show the crew how much fun being *immune to fall damage* is?”

Our eyes met and he winked.

**********

Now that I'd seen a decent sample size of humans and other venlil all catastrophically fail at the first jump of Andre’s obstacle course, I understood his surprise when I had managed it. 

Jake, Mason, and myself baited the trap. With the enhanced strength and familiarity with our suits, each of us crossed the first gap of Andre’s obstacle course with ease and dexterity. We stood there as a trio and and watched in eager anticipation as one by one the guests in their tester suits fell for it. 

Ed and Lemmy, a human and venlil pair with names that seemed to amuse Mason to no end, had gone into the crash cubes first. Ed's attempt at a wall run ended instantly, his foot just skipping off the wall as he attempted to load his weight onto it.  Lemmy's showing was a touch more impressive. Despite being the oldest of the crew he managed to kick off the wall and aim for the pillar as I had, but his angle was off and he slammed torso first into the pole. Everyone shared a laugh as he wrapped his arms and legs around it and attempted to shimmy his way up. But gravity had her due and he slid into the cubes. 
 
Emli was next. The smoke coloured young woman was smart enough to know a rigged game when she saw it, but made an effort anyway. She hit the first wall and scrambled all four sets of suit claws against its surface in a desperate attempt to get some lateral movement, but the smooth concrete refused to give and she too tumbled into the pit. 

I could tell from her voice that she was the one Andre had slept with in orbit. Watching her fall pleased my ego in a strange competitive way. 

Aldo was the last of our little playgroup to jump, but bouncing his shoulder off the wall and bellyflopping into the crash cubes didn't satisfy him. His second and third attempts were a little better, his fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh were atrocious. At this point the rest of the group had broken off to try out their suits. Lifting engine blocks like they were fruit boxes, smacking each other around with blunted weapons, and pulling apart wooden logs with their fingers. 

I rocked back and forth on my paws, my arms crossed as I watched Aldo's eighth attempt end like the others. 

“I admire your dedication, but at this point I think you are getting frustrated. Maybe you should try something else.” 

The ceiling mounted lifting crane hauled the grumbling veteran man up out of the cubes by his ankle. His displeased expression was easy to read through the tester suit's clear faceplate. I saw his eyes dart up to Emli as she casually shredded a massive log. He sighed and stuck his hand out to me. I grabbed it and pulled him over the platform. The crane released his ankle and he fell face down at my paws with an unceremonious clatter. 

“Thanks. Guess there was a reason they never gave me a combat suit.” He deflated while he spoke, until he was just a defeated heap in a can.

“You served?“ I leaned over him and hauled him up by the shoulder. 

“Yup! I served with the 82nd Marines, and barely got to the rank of corporal before they discharged me after the Cradle.”

“I heard things were grim over there.” 

He nodded and looked away from me, searching for solidarity from something he wasn't afraid could judge him in the middle distance. 

“The Gojid were so scared of us, and took constant potshots at literally everything, even their own people. The lizards were way worse though. Neither of them acted with any real tactics, but the lizards at least were aggressive and starving enough to be a problem. Command was so fucked and no one knew what anyone else was doing. When all the shit got fucked up and it turned into an evac mission out of nowhere, thats when we started getting all those orders like that. 'clear an LZ! get those ships out of the sky!' Where? How? With what anti air? never bothered telling us. just... y'know... do it.""


""So what *did* you do?"" I asked. 

""Well it wasn't really my call, I’m just a grunt. but the sergeant had the bright idea to take our little air-drop buggy on a joyride, couple other guys shooting up at them with our little peashooters. wasn't going to do anything, of course, but it *did* get their attention. we got a lot more people out because of that. It was some good thinking, and I’m not sure I would have come up with anything like that if I was in charge. Guess thats another reason they never put me in a combat suit, huh?""

I refused to validate his attempt at self depreciation and locked eyes with him. 

“Coming up with good improvisations like that is not something innate. It is a skill, and one with a trick to it.” I straightened myself up and puffed my chest out a little, years of command experience resurfacing as Aldo leaned in to listen. 

“What is your goal here?” I gestured at the gap.

“To wallrun across the gap, like you guys did.” Aldo replied, growing more unsure as his statement went on. 

“No, that's a notion you were led to by our methods. Your goal is merely to get across the gap without falling. Wallrunning has nothing to do with it.”

The big soldier looked across the gap between the platforms. “We didn't *need* to shoot the arxur down, we just needed them to *not shoot* the gojid.”

I crossed my arms and nodded. Before I could make a summarizing statement, Aldo took off for the wall. This time instead of trying to run along the wall, he ran up it and grabbed the ledge. He shimmied along the edge, the suits mechanical fingers making the incredibly strenuous maneuver casually easy. He reached the other side of the pit and let go. He dropped to the floor and stepped back to look at how far he had gone. 

Even from here I could see the wheels in his head turning, the lesson sinking in. 

The moment of contemplation was shattered a moment later by Ed shouting “BAH GAWD ALMIGHTY! HE'S Coming off the top rope!”

I whipped my head around in time to see Jake and Lemmy locked together in a strange grapple on the top turnbuckle of the fighting ring. It looked like Jake had stuck his head between Lemmy's legs in an attempt to lift him off it. A moment later the older venlil wrapped his arms around the doubled over Jake and jumped forward. They did a single flip together, and Jake's helmet slammed into the floor. 

“The Canadian Destroyer! Bah Gawd! The Killmiester has broken his entire skeleton!”

While he was hollering, Emli crept up behind him with a metal folding chair, her tail lashing out behind her. Once she'd closed the distance she waited until he paused to take a breath, then pounced. She leapt into the air and clobbered him over the head with the chair, the flimsy metal frame shattering apart as suit strength met suit armour.

Aldo meandered around the pit and headed towards the ring. “This zen stuff's great, but I'm not gonna let a chance to bodyslam Ed through a table go by.”

My tail flicked with amusement and I went to join the fun.

I really want to go back to Chiang Mai, because last time it was my favorite place in Thailand but because of the burning season.

I’ll be in Krabi until 26.03 and will leave Thailand on 12.04. I want to spend some days in Bangkok at the end, but in the meantime, where should I go?

I’ve already been to:
- Bangkok (like it there)
- Chiang Mai (<3)
- Pai

- Pattaya (never again)
- Koh Tao
- Koh Pha-ngan 
- Koh Samui
- Phuket
- Koh Chang
- Koh Kood
- Koh Phi phi 
- Khao Lak
- Koh Lanta
- Koh Yao Noi
- Krabi (obviously)
- Khao Sok

I’ve been mostly in island the past few weeks so I could use a change. I like beautiful nature(mountains, jungle), small cities and cute coffee shops. I also mainly eat vegan/ vegetarian food. 

Would love to explore some less touristy more authentic places. My only idea right now in kanchanaburi, but I would really appreciate your tips :)

I have a small coffee YouTube channel where I document my morning pour-overs, and today’s video is dedicated to New Zealand. I had the chance to visit a while back, and I absolutely fell in love with the country — the people, the culture, and of course, the amazing coffee scene. To celebrate, I featured a special guest in this video: my beloved kiwi plushie, a souvenir from my trip that brings back so many fond memories.

What struck me most about New Zealand is the deep love Kiwis have for their homeland. Whether it was conversations with locals, stories shared over a flat white, or just observing the care and pride people have for their communities, it left a lasting impression on me. That passion is inspiring, and it made me want to capture a little piece of that in my coffee routine.

If you’re from NZ (or just love it as much as I do), I’d be thrilled if you checked out the video and let me know what you think. Thanks for letting me share this little tribute — sending coffee-fueled love from afar!

Every time I fly I make it a point to bring gifts for the cabin crew and pilots. If time permits, I make gifts bags with things like custom stickers, face masks, chocolates, gift cards. It isn't a full basket, but definitely a hefty bag.

The problem I face is that I'm never sure how many to make and the idea of not having enough for everyone makes me itchy. I want to Google ""How many flight attendants are on X type of plane?"" but I'm terrified of ending up on a list somewhere. 

So two questions-

1) Would 6 individual gift bags for CC, 2 for pilots, be enough for domestic US flights?

2) Is there something you would really like to have that would make you feel appreciated?

I fly out next week and have a layover each way, so I'm preparing things now. Thank you for everything you do to keep us safe!

In these bags I have:
-A thank you card
-A big box of assorted chocolates
-Flight themed bottle openers
-Key chain
-Fun little built your own paper plane  kit
-Sunglasses that say ""So Fly"" with see-through vinyl
-Sticker packs (attached)
-And car window decals that say ""Don't make me use my Cabin Crew voice""

1je6a9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1je6a9u/aio_i_unfollowed_a_woman_ive_been_casually_seeing/,AIO? I unfollowed a woman I've been casually seeing for 6 months without a last conversation about moving on?,"Hi, everyone.

I'll try to keep it brief, but it's a long and tortuous story, and I'm naturally verbose.

Anyway, a woman in my grad program introduced herself to me back in September, and I was instantly smitten, as she seemed exactly my type: intelligent, artsy, etc. For a while, she was constantly inviting me to do things with her, coming around just to spend time with me, and the like. I was on cloud 9, and couldn't believe my luck.

After she made her intentions known, however, that she wanted to date, and things took a more expressly romantic and sexual turn, behaviors began to surface that made me question whether it was such a good idea. Once she saw a handsome man in public, and described him as ""the most beautiful man I'd ever seen,"" which I found strange, as if it was calculated to draw a negative reaction out of me or undercut my self-esteem or something. She also demonstrated a tendency to become borderline enraged over comments that I found anodyne or innocuous, and would storm off or resort to profanity and name-calling. She went on a date with another guy, which she told me about eventually when the topic of exclusivity came up, but she left one of our dates for this other one at the time, and crafted a lie to explain her departure. Finally, although there are other misgivings I could mention (I'm abridging the list to spare you the wall of text), she seemed to have little regard for my schedule, and would ask to hang out last minute despite looming deadlines. If she had something she had to get done, it was a firm boundary, but if I did, it was something for her to negotiate and overcome. All in all, cracks in the perfect facade began to appear, and although I tried to rationalize them away (everyone is flawed, right?), I couldn't shake the feeling deep down that I was making a mistake.

At the same time, however, she was closer to a ""real"" partner than I'd come before: she would say things like ""you'd be such a good dad,"" ""I feel safe with you,"" ""I'm lucky to know you,"" etc. I felt like those verbal attestations, coupled with her desire to see me at every opportunity, stay the night, be intimate, etc. indicated that she was truly and deeply invested.

Granted, she did tell me when she proposed dating that she had ended an 8-year relationship within the past year, and wasn't ready for a full commitment yet. She estimated that she could be within 6 months, which gave me hope that, if things went well, our ""no-pressure"" dates could evolve into something substantial. 

As things continued, they seemingly got better and worse at the same time. On the one hand, she'd bring up the possibility of doing things together in the long-term like a summer vacation, but on the other, when I went home for Christmas break, I didn't receive a call or text for 3 weeks (not even a ""merry Christmas"" or ""happy New Year"") from someone who professed to ""really like"" me. When I got back from the holidays, we met up as we had grown accustomed to doing, were intimate, and the like. However, she mentioned that she should be going out less ""to save money"" and maybe should refrain from staying the night, ostensibly due to how small and uncomfortable my bed is.  
  
Around the six-month mark, I checked in, and mentioned this strange paradox of deepening and lessening intimacy. She acknowledged that ""the vibe was different from last semester,"" but insisted she was busier (something that clashed with her other statement to the effect that she had extremely lenient due dates.) I effectively told her that I found casual dating with someone I liked unfulfilling and even masochistic, and wasn't interested in investing in something that wasn't going to progress and that was inevitably going to end. She told me she regretted giving the 6-month benchmark, as it was unrealistic, and she's still figuring out what she wants. I told her that's fine, but we want different things.

She asked me to a coffee shortly thereafter, and, one thing leading to another, she came back to my apartment and we were intimate, although I felt an uneasiness, an uncanniness, like I could see her putting on a false appearance in real time with her performance of affection, as it felt contrived and like she was merely going through the motions to give me what she thought I wanted to keep me around. She told me she wasn't sure I still wanted to do ""this"" - meaning spend time making out, having sex, cuddling, etc. - and I responded by saying that I'm not sure what I want: I felt like I really liked her, but I also knew we had incompatible desires. She told me that if I didn't want to see her, I should just say that. The night ended unremarkably, and we went our separate ways. It was vague as to whether we were still ""casually dating.""

Weeks went by, and while she would occasionally text, they were short, unemotional, and didn't involve asking me out or asking to come over, unlike precedent. She came along to see a movie on my birthday (she had completely forgotten it was my birthday, which I felt let down by), but other than that, if I asked her to come over or stick around, the answer was always a ""no"" or a ""we'll definitely do something later."" This new, even more nebulous status quo had exacerbated every doubt and insecurity I'd had about the status quo ante, as it was even more noncommittal albeit with little to no affection. Were we still dating? The only indicator I got that she still cared was when she insistently pressed me about the nature of my relationship with a woman I spent some time with on my birthday weekend, but even then, her jealousy seemed muted and fleeting.

The other day, she effectively ignored me in class besides making brief small talk in favor of walking, chatting, laughing, and sitting with some guy she claims to be friends with. She left with him, not turning to say goodbye to me or anything. I later entered a work area on campus, and saw them sitting together. She spoke with me somewhat, but the contrast, to me, felt dramatic between how she'd interact with him as opposed to me. She seemed genuinely interested in exchanging with him: her eyes lit up, she'd giggle, make playful faces. She seemed like an infatuated schoolgirl making eyes at ""the bad boy."" The enthusiasm, the active participation, the body language all suggested flirting, something she hadn't done with me in weeks, if not months. As we were leaving, I tried to strike up conversation, but while she began answering me, this guy - who she told me not to worry about months ago, by the way - boldly inserted himself, and she pivoted away from me to explain to him and then essentially embark upon a whole other conversation, leaving me behind. In that conversation, she seemingly asked him to a movie. She only turned to say ""bye"" to me when I began to feel ridiculous and finally left. 

That night, feeling hopeless that we'd ever recover the intensity and seeming affection of those early days, I unfollowed her on one social media platform. When I awoke, I found that she'd unfollowed me back, and deleted her likes from my posts (which may indicate that she blocked me as well.) My stomach immediately dropped and I began to regret doing this. Maybe I overreacted? Maybe I was being childish? Should I write and tell her it was a mistake (in a way, it kind of was: my finger hovered over the button for so long, when I actually pushed it, it wasn't wholly intentional)? If I were to try and walk this back, would it be pointless, me prolonging the torment of a clearly dead pseudo-relationship? Was I an asshole for wordlessly unfollowing, in a way that probably struck her as sudden, and not trying to tell her directly that I can't exist in this relational limbo anymore?",1,1742308189.0,AmIOverreacting,3,1.0,False

1je68gp,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1je68gp/aitah_for_unfollowing_a_situationship_after/,AITAH for unfollowing a situationship after feeling her interest fade rather than explicitly ending it?,"Hi, everyone.

I'll try to keep it brief, but it's a long and tortuous story, and I'm naturally verbose.

Anyway, a woman in my grad program introduced herself to me back in September, and I was instantly smitten, as she seemed exactly my type: intelligent, artsy, etc. For a while, she was constantly inviting me to do things with her, coming around just to spend time with me, and the like. I was on cloud 9, and couldn't believe my luck.

After she made her intentions known, however, that she wanted to date, and things took a more expressly romantic and sexual turn, behaviors began to surface that made me question whether it was such a good idea. Once she saw a handsome man in public, and described him as ""the most beautiful man I'd ever seen,"" which I found strange, as if it was calculated to draw a negative reaction out of me or undercut my self-esteem or something. She also demonstrated a tendency to become borderline enraged over comments that I found anodyne or innocuous, and would storm off or resort to profanity and name-calling. She went on a date with another guy, which she told me about eventually when the topic of exclusivity came up, but she left one of our dates for this other one at the time, and crafted a lie to explain her departure. Finally, although there are other misgivings I could mention (I'm abridging the list to spare you the wall of text), she seemed to have little regard for my schedule, and would ask to hang out last minute despite looming deadlines. If she had something she had to get done, it was a firm boundary, but if I did, it was something for her to negotiate and overcome. All in all, cracks in the perfect facade began to appear, and although I tried to rationalize them away (everyone is flawed, right?), I couldn't shake the feeling deep down that I was making a mistake.

At the same time, however, she was closer to a ""real"" partner than I'd come before: she would say things like ""you'd be such a good dad,"" ""I feel safe with you,"" ""I'm lucky to know you,"" etc. I felt like those verbal attestations, coupled with her desire to see me at every opportunity, stay the night, be intimate, etc. indicated that she was truly and deeply invested.

Granted, she did tell me when she proposed dating that she had ended an 8-year relationship within the past year, and wasn't ready for a full commitment yet. She estimated that she could be within 6 months, which gave me hope that, if things went well, our ""no-pressure"" dates could evolve into something substantial. 

As things continued, they seemingly got better and worse at the same time. On the one hand, she'd bring up the possibility of doing things together in the long-term like a summer vacation, but on the other, when I went home for Christmas break, I didn't receive a call or text for 3 weeks (not even a ""merry Christmas"" or ""happy New Year"") from someone who professed to ""really like"" me. When I got back from the holidays, we met up as we had grown accustomed to doing, were intimate, and the like. However, she mentioned that she should be going out less ""to save money"" and maybe should refrain from staying the night, ostensibly due to how small and uncomfortable my bed is.  
  
Around the six-month mark, I checked in, and mentioned this strange paradox of deepening and lessening intimacy. She acknowledged that ""the vibe was different from last semester,"" but insisted she was busier (something that clashed with her other statement to the effect that she had extremely lenient due dates.) I effectively told her that I found casual dating with someone I liked unfulfilling and even masochistic, and wasn't interested in investing in something that wasn't going to progress and that was inevitably going to end. She told me she regretted giving the 6-month benchmark, as it was unrealistic, and she's still figuring out what she wants. I told her that's fine, but we want different things.

She asked me to a coffee shortly thereafter, and, one thing leading to another, she came back to my apartment and we were intimate, although I felt an uneasiness, an uncanniness, like I could see her putting on a false appearance in real time with her performance of affection, as it felt contrived and like she was merely going through the motions to give me what she thought I wanted to keep me around. She told me she wasn't sure I still wanted to do ""this"" - meaning spend time making out, having sex, cuddling, etc. - and I responded by saying that I'm not sure what I want: I felt like I really liked her, but I also knew we had incompatible desires. She told me that if I didn't want to see her, I should just say that. The night ended unremarkably, and we went our separate ways. It was vague as to whether we were still ""casually dating.""

Weeks went by, and while she would occasionally text, they were short, unemotional, and didn't involve asking me out or asking to come over, unlike precedent.

# Why use a brochure or catalog?

One of the biggest advantages of running a **snack fundraiser with brochures** (or online catalogs) instead of doing it all yourself is that the **hard work is already done for you**. With a brochure fundraiser, you don’t have to source ingredients, prepare food, package snacks, or worry about food safety. The fundraising company provides professional-grade products, handles the inventory, and gives you everything you need to start selling—whether it’s printed brochures or easy online stores. All your team has to do is share the catalog and collect orders.

Snack brochure fundraisers are also **way easier to scale**. Instead of trying to bake 500 cookies for a sale or guess how much popcorn to make, you take orders first and the company fulfills exactly what you need. This keeps costs down, reduces waste, and helps you hit bigger goals without the stress of organizing the product side. Plus, snack fundraisers through brochures often feature premium treats like gourmet popcorn, cookie dough, or specialty nuts—things people are excited to buy, which makes it easier to sell and more profitable for your team.

# 💡 Tips to Market Your Snack Fundraiser:

✅ Go where the people are. Sell at games, school pickup lines, tournaments, and community events.

✅ Create urgency. Use phrases like “Limited time only!” or “One weekend only!”

✅ Show off the goods. Post photos of the snacks on social media and in team chats.

✅ Offer incentives. Give prizes to top sellers or teams to keep motivation high.

✅ Make it convenient. Use online stores, QR codes, and easy payment methods like Venmo and Cash App.

1je67jc,https://www.reddit.com/r/BusTravelAdventures/comments/1je67jc/why_taking_a_bus_is_the_most_underrated_travel/,Why Taking a Bus is the Most Underrated Travel Move,"Okay, I know what you’re thinking—buses? Really? But hear me out. We’re all about finding cheaper, easier, and less stressful ways to travel, and somehow buses never get the credit they deserve. Sure, they don’t have the hype of flights or the nostalgia of road trips, but once you really look at the perks, you might start questioning why you haven’t been booking more bus tickets.

Let’s break it down:

# 1. Travel for the Cost of a Fancy Coffee Order

Seriously. If you’ve been hit with the sticker shock of flight prices, you’ll appreciate just how far you can go on a bus for way less. No surge pricing, no overpriced airport food, just an affordable way to get where you need to go.

# 2. No Pre-Travel Stress (Or Security Lines from Hell)

Ever had a 6 AM flight and had to wake up at 3 AM just to get through security? Yeah, not fun. With a bus, there’s no TSA stress, no need to show up hours early, and no frantic searches for a missing boarding pass. Just get there, hop on, and chill.

# 3. Actually Enjoy the Ride

Road trips are fun until you realize you have to drive the entire way. Flying is convenient until you realize you’ve seen nothing but clouds for hours. Bus travel? You actually get to enjoy the scenery—mountains, small towns, city skylines—you name it. And the best part? You don’t have to be the one driving.

# 4. No Mystery Fees (Looking at You, Airlines 👀)

Booking a cheap flight feels like a win… until you add baggage fees, seat selection, and airport transfers. Suddenly, that “deal” isn’t so great. Buses? One ticket, one price. Simple.

# 5. Skip the Airport Hassle & Get Dropped Off Downtown

Ever landed at an airport and realized you’re nowhere near where you actually need to be? Yeah, that doesn’t happen with buses. [Trailways](https://trailways.com/schedules/) drops you off in the middle of the action, not 45 minutes away in some airport zone with overpriced taxis.

# 6. The Vibes Are Unmatched

Buses are like a social experiment in the best way possible. You’ll find students, backpackers, business travelers, and that one person who brings an entire meal for a two-hour ride (respect). People-watching? A+.

# 7. It’s a Low-Key Green Choice

If you’ve been looking for ways to travel more sustainably, buses beat cars and planes in emissions per passenger. No need to give up travel—just take a greener route.

# Bottom Line: Don’t Sleep on Bus Travel

Is every bus ride perfect? No. But for affordable, stress-free, and genuinely interesting travel, it’s wildly underrated. So next time you’re planning a trip, check the bus schedule—your wallet (and sanity) will thank you.

What has become your FAVORITE and LEAST FAVORITE ingredient(s) to add to a dish while on Whole30?

I’ll start. Sweet potatoes quickly became my favorite thing to add to a dish, not only because they’re so delicious, but also that they’re so versatile and are a healthier source of carbs! Also, homemade date paste quickly became my best friend when it came to sweetening my coffee. 

My least favorite ingredient is cod (I breaded it with almond flour and some spices then air fried it), and I didn’t really care for cauliflower rice all that much.

1je661s,https://www.reddit.com/r/berlinsocialclub/comments/1je661s/my_bad_experience_in_a_berlin_club_feeling_lost/,My Bad Experience in a Berlin Club – Feeling Lost After an Accusation,"Just a little backstory: I’m a very socially anxious person. I can handle myself well in a proper conversation, but I almost never start one myself (because most of the time, I’m just talking to myself in my head). I overthink a lot—especially after awkward interactions—and I’m always self-conscious, even when I’m alone. But Berlin clubs are one of the few places where I actually feel safe, free to dance, and express myself in this chaotic world.

So, last Saturday, I went to a club with my girlfriend, and everything was amazing! It was honestly one of the best nights I’ve had clubbing in Berlin. Around 5 AM, my girlfriend got tired (because she didn’t take any vitamins except the devil’s lettuce) and wanted to go home. But I was still full of energy because I took my vitamins, and the music was amazing, so I told her I’d stay for a bit and then follow her home.

This was the first time I was ever alone in a club—usually, I avoid crowded places when I’m by myself. But the music was too good, and I was dancing non-stop, feeling completely in the moment.

Eventually, I started coming down from the vitamins, got tired, and decided to sit in the chill zone before heading home. Of course, I chose a seat at the edge to be alone in peace.

There was a group of friends sitting nearby, and at one point, a girl turned to me, grabbed her bottle of water, looked at me weirdly, and asked:

""Did you put something in my bottle?""

At first, I couldn’t even process what she was saying. My brain just froze. I had to ask her twice more before I was sure I understood the question. When I finally realized what she was accusing me of, I told her, ""No.""

She gave me a very insincere smile and said something like ""I’m just joking"" or ""It’s just for fun,"" then turned back to her friends.

I understand that people need to be cautious in clubs, and I’m actually glad she was being careful—but I never expected to be accused of something like that.

After that, my whole night turned into a nightmare. Suddenly, every look I got in the club made me feel like a creep. I started questioning myself:

Did I do something wrong?

Do I really look like the kind of guy who would do this?

What if she actually believed I did something and wasn’t joking? What would have happened then?

My brain and heart were shattered, but eventually, I pulled myself together and left the club.

Even now, I can’t wash this moment off of me. I’m still overthinking it. I still wonder what I could have done differently—or what could have happened if the situation had escalated.

I don’t think I’ll be going to any clubs anytime soon… or maybe ever again. My anxieties are way worse now. Yesterday, I went on a long walk through Berlin, but even sitting alone at a café, I couldn’t comfortably drink my coffee—I just felt weird about myself.

My Questions:

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

If this happens again, how should I handle it to keep myself and the girl safe?

Sorry for the long rant. I just needed to get this off my chest.

Update: I really appreciate the support from some of you. I understand my own psychological tendencies, and I actively work on them—I’m actually doing great most of the time.

However, I feel like many people in the comments are treating this as if it’s just a common club joke. It’s not. This is a serious accusation, and it’s not something you experience every day. An accusation like this can have very real and serious consequences.

So, my most important question remains: If this happened to you, how did you handle it? or what is the proper way to handle a situation like this?

Should I just say ""No"" and walk away? Or should I offer to go to security so they can resolve the situation properly?

Forget about my own psychological well-being for now—that will pass in a few days. What I really need to know is how to react if this happens again in the future.

—still don't love them. The whole thing leans too farmhouse, and l'd like to modernize it and make it look sleeker.
Would switching out the knobs help? If so, what kind (color, shape, material) would work best? Or should I consider painting the white a different color? I want something that feels more chic, modern, and polished but still homey since it's a large piece in the space.
Waiting on the rest of my furniture, but l'll attach a Canva mockup of what's coming! The coffee table is marble, so that leans more modern. All ideas would be greatly appreciated! And any other suggestions (decor light fixtures art curtain rods) welcome as well!

Added a version without knobs to hopefully spark creativity. TIA!",1,1742307840.0,DesignMyRoom,2,1.0,False
1je64xf,https://i.redd.it/9q9oe3dljgpe1.jpeg,Zimaya Tiramisu Coco - Cafe in a bottle,"I think I might be one of the first people in India to get my hands on this. The perfume opens very smoothly with no alcohol blast. It has a slightly boozy touch, with a prominent coffee note that lingers throughout the entire journey. As it develops, it becomes more lactonic and vanillic, eventually turning into a very sugary-sweet scent. I also pick up some ambroxan, which reminds me a lot of Liquid Brun. 

What really stands out is how immersive the scent feels—it’s like sipping a hot cup of Latte while enjoying some coffee biscuits. It specifically reminds me of Bisfarm Biscafe biscuits (if you've ever tried them, they are genuinely very good lol)

This fragrance is definitely not suited for high-temperature summers but would work much better in colder weather. I'm currently getting around 7-8 hours of longevity on clothes, with slightly less on skin. However, the projection is quite mild.

I’ve tried Mancera Amore Café, which this is a clone of, and I’d say it gets about 90% close to the original in terms of scent profile. The one major drawback is the projection—it stays quite close to the skin, which doesn’t match the bold presence of the one by Mancera. That said, for the price range, this is an excellent coffee fragrance.",11,1742307794.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,8,0.93,False

On socials Bill had said there were some quality edits needed which is why S2 is 45 minutes when he wanted hour episodes.

Dweeb continues his journey to undweeb himself, working on having just the right amount of facial hair and calling out Dani for volunteering for too many extra shifts. Dani is workworkwork-- Chief notices, but he is still beat down. Dweeb gets Dani back up via a long story about high school and specialty potato chips, which was surprisingly sweet.

Now Marcos (the gallery guy) is sad because he is losing his art dream. Dani tries to bring him back up. Chief is running out of options.

Dani goes on a run to The Club to grab mealtime for the team, Grif is there, but so is the rich woman with the dementia dad (who Grif is helping). There are significant looks and a deep conversation, but it does not feel like the rich woman is into Dani or Grif that way. Not sure where this is going. In fact, she seems to be telling Grif to chase Dani?

The coffee machine contest drama is still ongoing, Ashley is wistful as the flight paramedic thing gets closer. Dani and her discuss pressure and prayer. Dalton and Ashley make a decision, because he is supportive. 

Dweeb is really shocked at a call with bad results. We don’t see the call, but we see him devastated after.

Dweeb and Dani go to a call, he ignores safety protocol and drags Dani into danger to get to the victim faster. Chief gives him a butt chewing. 

Chief gives Dani the bad news that she is out, and gives her a letter of recommendation. I thought that was going another way and I was wrong. ",1,1742307611.0,GACFamily,0,1.0,False

I’ve experimented with taking them 30 minutes to an hour *before* eating breakfast or drinking coffee, which seemed to help prolong their effectiveness and delay or stave off crashes. 

But I’m wondering if people recommend taking their Vyvanse *before* working out as well? 

I do hour long workout classes in the morning most of the times when I work out. So if I took it before I left for my class it’d be dissolving into my system during my workout class and then I’d come home and eat breakfast and drink coffee after that.

1je612t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1je612t,I do not feel like an ENTJ at all,"Pretty much the title. I don't relate to an ENTJ at all. I have people-pleasing tendencies to the point where I'll let others walk all over me, I usually avoid confrontation and I don't know how I'd feel in leadership positions, I don't really plan out a lot of my days and I procrastinate a lot. I can also become anxious around others. I sometimes switch between having really low self-esteem and an unhealthy amount of arrogance. When I was a kid I typed as INTJ. When I was like 19-23 I typed as ENTP although this was always on 16 personalities. Now I consistently type as ENTJ. I'm sorry, I do not have the patience or desire to learn all the cognitive function crap. 

* **How old are you?**
   * 25
* **What do you do as a job or as a career (if you have one)?**
   * Unemployed. Currently looking for a job. I don't know what I want to do, but I want something that's flexible and pays well so that I can maybe invest in my own pursuits and possibly turn them into something greater. I would enjoy rising high in a company as long as I get to be flexibile and not be micromanaged. I've considered the idea of a chill job like at a record store, but that would make me feel stuck in life.
* **Describe your childhood/upbringing. Did you have any significant negative experiences that may have affected how you think or behave?**
   * My mother was strict and my father became less involved in my life as I grew older. I was taught to not speak against whatever my mother said. I became fearful of disapproval and standing up for myself because I was scared to get yelled at. This still affects me today. I was also bullied when I was really young and then bullied again a little bit in middle school and high school.
* **If you had to spend an entire weekend by yourself, how would you feel? Would you feel lonely or refreshed?**
   * I can spend a whole week by myself and feel fine. Though, when I spend too much time alone, I get extremely anxious and stressed. I absolutely need to recharge by being around others.
* **How curious are you? Do you have more ideas then you can execute? What are your curiosities about? What are your ideas about - is it environmental or conceptual, and can you please elaborate?**
   * I am very curious and like learning about whatever interests me. Right now, I am reading War and Peace and am learning about 19th century Europe. My curiosities range from how the future of the world will pan out with current technological and political trends to deep philosophical questions and more immediate things like how I can improve my life.
* **Would you enjoy taking on a leadership position? Do you think you would be good at it? What would your leadership style be?**
   * This really depends on the position. I'm not sure if I'd enjoy leading a corporate team. I've never tried it. I have personally experienced weak leadership at my old job and it was the main reason I quit. I would try to be as effective as I can in inspiring loyalty while also being firm in my leadership so as to set standards. I did lead a club in college but it was small. I enjoyed it though.
* **Are you artistic? If yes, describe your art? If you are not particular artistic but can appreciate art please likewise describe what forums of art you enjoy. Please explain your answer.**
   * I love art and the emotions that art can make me feel. I would say my mind is artistic meaning I have ideas about groundbreaking movies, shows, and video games, but I don't possess the skill to make art right now nor do I have a desire to learn how to draw or paint. I do enjoy art of all kinds except for realistic art because I find it boring.
* **What's your opinion about the past, present, and future? How do you deal with them?**
   * I feel nostalgia for the past and wish I could return to it in order to correct the mistakes I've made and the other half of the time I'm envisioning the future. Rarely ever am I present unless I'm engaged in some type of real-life activity.
* **How important is efficiency and productivity to you?**
   * Both are important because without either I'll never get anywhere in life. With that said, when it comes to personal affairs, I procrastinate like hell.
* **What are your hobbies? Why do you like them?**
   * I enjoy reading classic literature and philosophy. Reading makes me feel like I'm making progress with myself and I also enjoy it. I also like single-player games, playing guitar, cello, and tennis. I invest my money in stocks every now and then too. I'll say that I don't enjoy hobbies that feel useless to me. That's why I don't spend too much time gaming these days.
* **What is your learning style? What kind of learning environments do you struggle with most? Why do you like/struggle with these learning styles? Do you prefer classes involving memorization, logic, creativity, or your physical senses?**
   * I dislike memorization. I prefer to understand the underlying theory behind things. My favorite classes in college were my philosophy classes.
* **What are your aspirations?**
   * I don't know. I want to do something that feels meaningful to me. I just want to feel like I'm going places.
* **What are your fears? What makes you uncomfortable? What do you hate? Why?**
   * Complacency, mediocrity and staying in the same place in life. I want to feel like I'm moving in life. I don't know why. I can't explain it. I just need to feel like I'm working towards something greater.
* **What do the ""highs"" in your life look like?**
   * I'm very driven and motivated. I'm going places in life, getting out and meeting people, filling my schedule up with enough events to make me feel satisfied while also getting to enjoy some alone time.
* **What do the ""lows"" in your life look like?**
   * Like the last 5 months: aimless, lazy, not doing anything all day besides playing video games and unemployed. Though, two weeks ago, I quit online gaming, started working out again, replaced gaming with reading, uninstalled Tiktok and quit smoking weed. I do feel much better now and more confident. I have an internal ""emergency break"" so to speak that activates when things get bad. 
* **How long do you take to make an important decision? And do you change your mind once you've made it?**
   * I take awhile. I analyze different options and try my best to narrow everything down to the best decision I can make. I don't like having regrets. 
* **How long do you take to process your emotions? How important are emotions in your life?**
   * I need time to sit alone and think things through. Processing emotions in the moment is nearly impossible for me.
* **Do you ever catch yourself agreeing with others just to appease them and keep the conversation going?**
   * Yes. I can be a huge people pleaser at times. 
* **What is the ideal life, in your opinion?**
   * I do think it would be cool to achieve greatness by becoming someone who transforms the world and inspires others. Having my name etched in history because I left behind a legacy so significant would be my ultimate dream. I have fantasized about living a peaceful serene life chilling on a beach for 50 years, but I would get so bored doing the same thing everyday. I think my two biggest dreams would be to become a world-famous musician like Freddie Mercury or a conqueror like Napoleon.
* **Here are some more things I've been writing down about me during the past few weeks:**
   * If I'm gonna hangout with someone, I prefer plans to be set days in advance. I dislike being notified about potential outings a few hours prior.
   * I have always had a strong sense of ambition that has run latent. It has caused me to constantly seek out novelty.
   * I'm a minimalist and dislike buying unnecessary shit. I don't understand collecting things like anime figurines, sneakers, funko pops, etc. The only things I'd collect are books, luxury properties and luxury cars.
   * I tend to ignore and glaze over things like my student loan payments, tax returns, insurance bs. 
   * I am not really a caretaker or people-oriented person. I could never be a nurse for example.
   * I can be ruthless in cutting people out of my life. The people you surround yourself with affect you. I just dropped all my online friends because all they do is game for 10 hours a day. 
   * I don't understand or relate to people who are very religious or into stuff like zodiac signs, healing crystals and other spiritual bs. In fact, I find them to be annoying.
   * Overly emotional and extremely outwardly passionate people weird me out
   * I don't really like using emojis. 
   * I find it extremely difficult to display strong emotions. I have to fake them and it feels so awful and unnatural to me even though I'm more than capable of feeling strong emotions. I can easily shed tears watching movies, reading books, or playing games. I just find it difficult to display emotions outward.
   * I can relate to some stereotypical ENTP traits. I'll troll my friends, be very silly and goofy with them, and I love a good discussion depending on what it is. Though I dislike any form of arguing or debate unless it's over something stupid like pizza toppings. I don't relate to the constant brainstorming and scattered thoughts. I dislike feeling unfocused. It prevents me from doing anything.
   * I appreciate aesthetic things a lot. For example, if the sky is a nice shade of blue, or the interior of a coffee shop feels very welcoming, I'll feel a nice emotional response that I'll just sit with for awhile.
   * I like poetry and Shakespeare because his words are beautiful and help me understand humanity and myself more. ",4,1742307511.0,MbtiTypeMe,3,1.0,False

Our wedding is set for the last week of March, and it's a semi-intimate celebration—if you can call it that. We have:

* **9 pairs of principal sponsors**
* **Maid of honor & best man**
* **4 bridesmaids & 4 groomsmen**
* **6 secondary sponsors** (separate from the bridesmaids & groomsmen)
* **1 flower girl, 1 bearer for both the coin & ring, and our daughter as our little bride**

In total, we've counted **around 70 guests**.

# Food & Drinks

* We availed a **90-pax food package** to have a buffer.
* We’re only getting **one lechon (₱12k)**.
* We ordered **food for the on-the-day prep (breakfast & lunch)** since our wedding is in the afternoon.
* We're doing **DIY pica-pica** since packages for that are pricey.
* We **skipped the mobile bar** because we noticed at a recent wedding that most guests didn’t drink from it. Instead, we plan to **give out San Miguel Light (we plan to buy 3 cases of it)**.

# Entertainment & Extras

* We **only hired a wedding singer for the bridal march** since we couldn’t afford a live band for the reception.
* We have **prizes for games** and an **SDE (same-day edit video)** booked.

# Souvenirs & Giveaways

* **Principal sponsors** → Wine, coffee, and a Beerenberg jam trio set
* **Groomsmen** → 4-pack lager
* **Bridesmaids** → Pink Moscato
* **Secondary sponsors** → Red wine
* **Guests** → No traditional souvenirs, but we have a **photo booth** (which we count as their keepsake)

# What else do we need?

Are our souvenirs enough, or should we add something? Anything important we might be missing? Would love to hear your thoughts! Thanks in advance!",3,1742307475.0,WeddingsPhilippines,3,1.0,False

1je60aj,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingNashville/comments/1je60aj/my_nashville_trip_highlights/,My Nashville Trip Highlights,"I just got back from a 3-day trip to Nashville and want to share my experience since I got great tips in this sub! 

First, I did not realize how easy downtown is to walk, and how close the museums are. When I researched online it looked like things were spread out so I expected to Uber a lot, but NO! We walked almost exclusively to every landmark we had picked and we got to see more than we even expected. Wear good shoes and you’re good to go.

Second, I didn’t know the history of the honkey tonk and now I wish I had carved us out time to go to them. Even though I’m not a country music fan, I am a live music fan and a music history fan, and knowing how it all got started brought the real meaning to honkey tonk row. I highly recommend learning and then going. Carve out several hours and bring cash for tips. None of the musicians are paid by the venues.

Last, the FOOD. I am not a fan of spicy food and had no idea how utterly delicious Nashville hot chicken is. Do yourself a favor and go to Redd’s. For real. GO. And check out the speakeasy next door when you go.

Here is what we did:

Thursday- walked around a bit and had dinner and drinks at 60 Vines. The rooftop is right next to the Ryman Auditorium! So gorgeous.

Friday - toured the Ryman. Take your time to see it all. We were there for 2 hours. And go during the day so you can see the windows lit up. You also get a souvenir photo with your tour! Lunch at Bakersfield, the tacos are legit. Get 3. Then we toured the National Museum of African American Music. Again, leave time, it’s absolutely beautiful and it’s interactive. For $5 get the bracelet and you’ll get a Spotify playlist at the end. Walked a lot more, stopped in a few souvenir shops. Dinner at Raising Cain’s, again that’s some dang good chicken and the building is so cool, go upstairs! Our show was at the Ryman, so we went back and had THE BEST TIME EVER. It’s an amazing venue. 10/10 recommend seeing a show there.

Saturday - got walk-in tattoos at Pride & Glory Tattoo, had coffee and homemade egg biscuit sandwich at Elegy Coffee (15/10) wandered more, and then took a food tour with Dabble Events. I learned about this right here in this sub and THANK YOU!!! Our driver was a full time working musician named Scott - SCOTT rocks!!! He taught us so much Nashville history and my passion is music and I officially adopted this as my favorite city by the end of this food tour. I literally had no idea how amazing TN is. Go on a food tour and if you do I recommend Dabble Events. 200/10. 

I know this is a long list but I really can’t overstate the joy this trip brought me. I’ve decided to make it a yearly trip because I barely scratched the surface of what’s there to offer. I try hope you have a blast when you go!!",8,1742307450.0,VisitingNashville,7,1.0,False
