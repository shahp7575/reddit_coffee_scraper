I have learned SO MUCH on this podcast, it's insane! They do address PCOS quite a lot during the interview.


They explain: 
◼️The shocking lack of research on women’s hormones, and how it’s harming health
◼️How insulin resistance fuels hormone imbalance, irregular cycles, and infertility
◼️How coffee, fasting, and overtraining can silently disrupt your hormones
◼️The truth about cycle syncing, and why your luteal phase changes everything
◼️How stress, sleep, and muscle mass directly influence perimenopause
◼️Why birth control is not a cure, and the lifestyle tools that actually help

I often go to this restaurant to have my afternoon coffee. Lastly I was starting to notice that female staff are cold and distant towards me, but males are very flirty and chatty with the female customers.

To be honest, it’s a bit irritating me making me feel unwanted.

Now accidentally 2 young women came sitting beside me and the waiter came and starts a flirty conversation with them. After he left I tried to have a bit of small talk, but after a while he came back and starts talking to the 2 ladies cutting me off.

How to deal with this?

I am planning it like below, and would greatly appreciate your advice to make it more awesome!

** 22nd November, Saturday: ** Arrive at Rome and travel to the city. My flight is supposed to land at 12:50 pm. Do I need to book the shuttle  bus from the Airport to the city centre in advance? I plan to just relax and sink in the vibe for the day. Any suggestions?

** 23rd November, Sunday: ** I am yet to plan for this day, and was looking at a day-long bus tour from Rome to Pompeii, Amalfi Coast, and Sorrento. ** Is it worth it? ** Or should I travel to Sorrento myself and take a boat tour by the Amalfi Coast? I am not the richest traveller, I must add.

** 24th November, Monday: ** This is the day I have planned to spend exploring the Collosseum, Forum & Palatine Hill. Just wanted to avoid the Sunday crowds, although have no idea how busy it would be on a Monday.

** 25th November, Tuesday: ** I hope to explore the Vatican City this day, and feeling confused about all the tour options available. Do I have to buy tickets for the Basilica? What about the Vatican Museum and the Sistine Chappell? ** Should I book a guided tour? **

** 26th November, Wednesday: ** My flight is booked for the midday. So, I am planning to keep the morning empty, perhaps exploring some traditional breakfast options. Any suggestions?

As you can see, my nights are free, and I am not quite sure how to spend it. ** Where could I get some artisanal souvenir like Pencil or small jewellery? What about the finest quality coffee and Pasta Sauce? **

Your advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

1onmi9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/EstrangedAdultKids/comments/1onmi9p/my_mother_reappeared_on_my_sons_4th_birthday/,My mother reappeared on my son’s 4th birthday after six months of silence,"After six months of complete silence, my mother suddenly called me the night before my son’s 4th birthday. She didn’t ask how we were or mention the past at all — she just wanted to discuss medical issues related to her husband and his father, and then mentioned how many gifts she and my brother had bought for my son. The next day (my son’s birthday), she and her husband made a short video call, which had been arranged in advance. During the call, it became clear they hadn’t planned to visit or bring the gifts in person. After the call, my son asked, “Aren’t Grandma and Grandpa coming? I’d like to see them.” Although I knew it wasn’t healthy and that there had been no real conversation about what happened between us, I sent her a message offering a short visit so my son could see them. Here’s the conversation that followed:

Me: Henry would like to see you. Do you maybe have an hour of time on Sunday before his party? 

Her: Are his friends coming on Sunday? 

Me: At 2 p.m. 

Her: We could come Saturday or Sunday. Whatever you prefer. You could also come to our place Saturday afternoon and stay as long as you like. I can also bake something… 

Me: We’ll be cooking and baking the whole weekend for the party, three kids and their parents are coming, and we’re doing coffee and dinner for everyone. We’ll also have other visitors Saturday afternoon. Saturday morning would also work for me, that’s probably less stressful before decorating. 

Her: Oh, then we’d better not disturb you. Michael (her husband) will drive by on Thursday and bring Henry‘s presents. 

Me: If you think so. But then it’s not really about Henry anymore. 

Her: Oh. And all this time, it was about Henry for you? 

Me: It’s always been about my son otherwise, I wouldn’t have invited you. 

Her: An hour is not an invitation. 

Me: This weekend has been planned for a long time, I’m sorry. Do you really expect me to invite myself for coffee and cake or come over as if nothing ever happened? You can’t be serious. You accused me and my husband together with your brother of not letting you be a grandmother, said I had no motherly love and would regret it when you die, claimed to your father that Michael was involved in that escalation. You haven’t managed to apologize to me for half a year and yet you expect phone calls about family health updates and coffee and cake invitations. That’s not how it works.

After reading this, I felt completely drained. There was no trace of self-reflection, no attempt at empathy, just blame and rewriting of what happened. I ended up blocking her on all channels because I simply couldn’t take it anymore. Now my son keeps asking why his grandparents didn’t come to his birthday and when he’ll see them again. I don’t know what to tell him without hurting him or lying. How would you interpret this behavior? Is this still within the range of normal family conflict, or can this be considered emotional manipulation or abuse? And how do I protect my child (and myself) while navigating this kind of “contact attempt”?",1,1762200611.0,EstrangedAdultKids,1,1.0,False

1onmhw1,https://i.redd.it/371nb3bym3zf1.png,Consciousness Isn’t Just Awareness,"# Consciousness Isn’t Just Awareness

When I was younger, I thought consciousness simply meant being awake—aware of yourself and your surroundings. But now I see another layer: the ability to stretch awareness across scales our senses can’t touch.

A cat knows hunger, warmth, and comfort.  
A human knows those too—but also knows what compound interest does at 21%. We can sense danger not just in the present, but projected years into the future.

We can imagine numbers like 10\^80 atoms in the universe. We can wrestle with the Busy Beaver problem—a computation so vast it outruns our machines. We can intuit the geometry of a black hole’s event horizon, though none of us will ever stand there.

We can hold the history of civilizations in mind, compressing millennia into a timeline we can speak about over coffee. We can think of climate systems—oceans, wind currents, carbon cycles—and understand that what we do in one century ripples through thousands of years.

We can map invisible forces:

* The probability curve of an electron.
* The odds of winning the lottery.
* The exponential spread of a virus.

No animal needs to know these things, but our consciousness insists on it.

That capacity—the ability to map meaning onto the invisible—is what gives us selfhood in a deeper sense. Consciousness is not just awareness; it’s memory, abstraction, and foresight intertwined.

It’s not just “I am.”  
It’s “I can imagine what’s beyond me.”

When I first posted about Coffee, I honestly didn’t know if anyone would notice. But the way everyone came together donating, sharing, sending love and kind words. It truly means a lot. 🙏

Because of you all, Coffee’s treatment and medicines are now fully covered. He’s doing better and getting the care he deserves.

Your help made it possible for Coffee to continue his treatment with proper care, medicine, and comfort. ❤️

For now, we’re not accepting any more donations, as the full goal is complete of his previous treatment has been completed. 
If there’s any new medical need or expense next month, I’ll share an update again with full transparency, just like before.

Thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping an old indie dog live his remaining days with comfort and dignity. 🐾❤️

Crying, honestly 🙏
You people literally gave Coffee and me hope that yes, we can take care of him properly without worrying about anything. I was so stressed until yesterday. We animal lovers might rescue dogs, but we all have our own struggles to deal with. Still, when I look at Coffee, my problems feel so small compared to his real health struggles.

Whether it’s an animal or a human, if you’re healthy and able to move freely, believe me, your other life problems are so temporary. So please, take care of your community dogs and your own health. ❤️

Coffee’s struggle is unimaginable. He’s lived on the streets since birth, and street life is never kind to anyone. That’s why I always say — please, adopt indies. So that if they somehow survive till the age of 10–11, they don’t have to keep suffering the way Coffee and so many others do on the roads. 🐾

Indians have literally rocked for indie animals.

1onmfpl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1onmfpl/m28_when_to_say_enough_is_enough_gf_f25/,M28 When to say enough is enough GF F25,"Hi reddit as title suggests just trying to figure out when is it safe to say enough is enough?

I am at my wits end with my girlfriend f25 of three years. It seems she does not care about me whatsoever isn't willing to make any adjustments or small changes in her life and I can't help but feel like were just stuck in this never ending cycle of hopelessness where I have to put in all the effort while she does the bare minimum if that. 

This Halloween I had been working a 14 hour shift, in my line of work I'm always on call and had a call in before my normal shift even started. 14 hours in and being badgered to rush home so that 'we' can go take her girlfriend and her girlfriends two kids out trick or treating. She allowed me no time to freshen up and have a shower or make dinner, didn't even bother to make me something to eat on the run. Instead she says 'I've already ate'. So what does that mean to me? Anyways soon as I get home her friend texts her saying we just have to eat dinner and grab some groceries then we are ready. I told her my GF that thats pretty rude to expect me to rush home after working 14 hours and now her friend is doing this. GF didn't see the logic and proceeded to try and make me feel like crap for having a opinion. 8pm rolls around, there are no other kids out, many houses ran out of candy just like I told them they would as it's way to late and by this time after 14 hours in Canada winter working outside my body was sore and numb. I was falling behind walking as my feet were just destroyed but she didn't care. At one point I even stopped to take some of the pain off my feet and to my surprise they just kept walking didn't even notice. 

Next day comes and its her mothers birthday and is in town, we go over to see her mother who's staying at a relatives of my girlfriend early in the morning even know the plan was to go visit her in the afternoon then take her out for dinner. During this time her mother asked us to come for a walk with her to the store, girlfriend gets winey and says I don't wanna walk in the cold, so I end up going with her mother. We get back and her mother wants to go for coffee, gf doesn't wanna go if we are not driving, but I had offered to take her mother in my car gf just couldn't be bothered to put her phone down and listen to what her mother said. So I go to coffee with her mom. We get back and her mom wants to go to this meat draw event that she always goes to when shes in town, sure enough gf's excuse is 'my tooth' she had a tooth ache..... I spent the entire day with her mother the only time gf made effort to see her own mother was over a free meal paid for by me. I was disgusted and her mother was so upset.

Fast forward to Sunday, we had planned to cook some of the meat draw winnings for breakfast together, which my gf does not cook never tries and leaves all the cooking to me for after work while she sits around. I had gotten a work call early in the AM and by the time everything was fixed it was about 1pm, when I got home she was playing video games with the friend who we had to take out trick or treating and I can her them both yelling at the oldest kid telling him to shut up and let mom play games. I was so pissed off. Kind of like cooking gf doesn't do any cleaning either, so I'm just waiting around for her to clean her weeks worth of dishes on the counter so I can cook us breakfast for lunch and sure enough the video games were more important. 

I made some food grabbed a to go container brough it over to my parents house and spent the rest of the day with them. I feel like these sort of things will never change and my girlfriend is just a misery to be around unless you are one of her loser friends who also don't work and just pop out children. It's a terrible mindset and I feel like this person is making me so negative.

I day dreamed as i do. Picturing you saying i know its 3:22am but what do you say we go get a coffee and catch up?. I pictured me going through that Mc Donald's where we first met.

ordering myself a double shot flatwhite on oat and a  flatwhite with caramel shot for you with 3 sugars. i would tell you i have our drinks and to meet me down at the waters edge where i first kissed you. We would  hug and smile and talk. Talk about anything and everything while avoiding but hinting at other things. You would ask about my children and i will ask about yours. You would scoot closer on the seat and lay your head on my sholder and go quite for what seems a life time. And finally ask what are we doing here? i wouldent have the answer all i know is i dont want to be anywhere else. You would close your eyes and say your a little sleepy so i would turn towards you and tell you to lean into my chest while i put my jacket over you in our make shift fort. You will dose off and i will keep guard letting you rest i will look down at you and pull you in tighter finding your hand and curling my fingers in yours and you will close yours around mine. You whisper to wake you up at sunrise. I look at you dreading the most beautiful time of day hoping the sun never rises. As the sky turns from onyx into dark Royal blue getting lighter by the minute the  enviable is only minutes away. I curse the gods and pray for the sun to go back to bed.

i wait for the last minute just as the dawn approach's  like a speeding train than i bend down and kiss your porcelain forehead to wake you. You open your eyes and look out over the water as the most amazing colors of reds yellows and orange's come over the horizon. You tell me that's the most beautiful array of colors you have seen i just smile at you looking into the distance but i wouldn't know because i was  already looking at the most beautiful creation god had made. I would sacrifice all of my Sunrises to look at you every morning because they would only be shades of gray compared.

Por ejemplo, experimentando con los varios tipos que he adquirido, encuentro que las Infiter si que bajan los graves en mi Juzear Clear, o que las KBear coffee, que son cortas y muy elásticas, son de las pocas que se ajustaron bien a la boquilla del DZ4 que tengo, o que las Simbyo se sienten bien pero con el uso prolongado me duelen los oídos. 

Al final, mucho de lo que se puede argumentar se refiere a criterios personales durante el uso y con relación a nuestros canales auditivos, y en general lo cierto para mí, es que la mayoría solo cumplen su función primaria de mejorar el aislamiento o la comodidad...de todas las que tengo concluyo que tan solo utilizo menos de la mitad, el marketing y la publicidad no necesariamente nos entrega lo que se promete, o ustedes que opinan?

1onm5bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1onm5bn/aitah_for_filing_a_police_report_on_my_roommate/,AITAH for filing a police report on my roommate and “making” her move out,"I (23m) filed a police report on my roommate (22?F). Hi there Reddit I’m sorry this is so long but I feel like a lot of backstory is needed. 

Last January I moved in with a friend and his gf, let’s call her Jane. Things went well at first but quickly turned sour after we all decided to look for a new home together along with another one of their friends, let’s call her Jess. I hadn’t gone looking for any new places with them because I didn’t really think I needed to. I was taking the smallest room in the house which I was completely okay with and so I didn’t really think my opinion of the place was that necessary. 

Jane and Jess both got upset with me that I wasn’t going to look with them and Jess and I had a conversation about it where she basically just expected me to do more. They were completely right as I shouldn’t just have expected them to find a house for the 4 of us on their own. I apologized to both of them (even though Jess was the only one to bring up anything to me) and said I would start looking for a place right away. 

Fast forward maybe 2 weeks later and I found a place that seemed really nice and affordable considering we would be splitting the rent 4 ways. Jess and I went to go see the place and we both really liked it and sent pictures as well as informing Jane and her Bf who were getting the master bedroom. They did not have any complaints and seemed to be happy with moving along in the process to get the house. This was great because the window we had to find a new place before their lease was up was quickly closing. 

Everything went smoothly from there and soon the property manager sent the lease for us to sign and was asking for the deposit and first month’s rent. This is when it went sour.  Jane and her bf signed the lease right away. I doubt they even read it over. When I informed my soon to be roommates that they needed to send first months rent and the deposit, Jane’s  Bf said he would not be able to pay for either at that time. This should have been my sign to gtfo of this situation but I digress.  I was obviously confused and taken aback. We’ve been looking for a house for over a month now and I had just assumed he was ready to pay for his share. Also they signed the lease already and who does that without having the funds to pay for rent. 

Now, Jane’s bf (my friend) had told me he had recently lost a significant amount of money before we had to pay anything but I still figured he would have enough to pay for his share because he hadn’t mentioned that it was that dire or that we should wait to commit to a place. So in our group chat we made, Jess and I offered to cover his rent for him as long as he paid us back. Jane responded with “you guys are gonna have to cover my share too”. This is when I got very frustrated because unlike her bf Jane did not have any excuse for not having the funds and again they both signed the lease right away unlike Jess and I who hadn’t even read it over yet. Also we didn’t receive an “oh my god thank you so much guys” like I expected and just a demand. Jess said she could cover Jane’s rent as well but I was definitely more hesitant. 

Jess later called me and convinced me to help out both of them as long as they agreed to pay us back in written form, just so we had some sort of documentation that they would pay us back. She later called again and explained how Jane was refusing to sign anything. She was also very upset at the whole situation but didn’t want to bring anything up to Jane or her bf and even told me not to tell Jane that she was so upset at her. I felt like I needed to be the one to put my foot down and talk to them since Jess pretty much wanted to stay out of it. At this point I said fuck that and that I will not be helping them pay anything without the bare minimum of agreeing to pay us back. I got home and had a conversation with Janes Bf (Jane was not home at the time) about how I was upset and how we needed to have better communication about these things and also how irresponsible it was to sign the lease without having any money to pay for rent or the deposit. I also explained that I would not be helping out unless they signed some sort of documentation. And if they couldn’t come up with the rent then they were on their own because they were the only ones to sign the lease. All things considered it went pretty well and I would wait to explain the same to Jane later when she got home. 

This is where I’m possibly an asshole. The next morning when they were both in the kitchen I wanted to talk to Jane but I could tell she was angry and when I tried talking to her about it she said “I don’t want to talk about it”
Now, not gonna lie this made me crash out. Her not wanting to talk about it after all that happened and expecting us to just pay for her share without her agreeing to pay us back really got to me. I wish I hadn’t let my emotions get the better of me but I couldn’t help it. I questioned her maturity and told her the same thing I told her bf albeit in a totally different tone. I remember her trying to tell me that the communication issue was my fault and I should have asked them if they had enough before moving along with getting the place. I got very upset and honestly don’t remember everything I said besides “it’s not my job to babysit you” but you get the idea, I was very upset. 

I walked away from the situation and let them figure it out on their own. I had not committed to the lease yet and wasn’t going to until they came up with the money. Which they did using Jane’s bf’s credit card. So now after all that it looked like we were still moving in together. Later Jess talked to me and said Jane was very upset and that I should apologize to her for talking to her that way in the kitchen. I think she just wanted to smooth things over to not cause any more drama and so did I. Although I stood by everything I said I also didn’t want the vibe in our new place to be completely shot. So when we were all in the living room I apologized to Jane explaining that I shouldn’t have let my emotions take over and should have talked to her differently but made it clear that I still stood by everything I said just not the way I said it. We seemed to have a better conversation about it and the things we could have done differently and I was hopeful we could just move on and start over. 

After this situation things just got worse. Shocker, I know. Every time Jane was around she seemed to be very condescending and rude to me from there on out and never seemed to move past it. I’ll admit I never really liked her. I always found her to be extremely rude and disrespectful to people even before we had any issues and I’m sure that shaped how I viewed her in these situations. She would always role her eyes and make comments that just weren’t necessary. One time my mom sent me a new coffee mug and she looked at the price tag on it and told me it was pretty cheap for a coffee mug. Like even if it was true, who says that about a gift someone’s mom got for them? 

I always tried to kill her with niceness but it seemed to never be reciprocated. She was rude to people I brought over. The first time my gf met her she asked “what’s her problem”. And I even tried to tell my gf that she’s just shy, and my gf had no idea about the drama we had in the past. I’m not expecting her to be my best friend but feeling welcome in my own home would be nice. Jess and her Bf both told me she had a a lot of complaints about me but would never communicate them with me instead she would make Jess or her Bf do it for her.  When she would finally talk to me about them it was always over text and always sounded rude. It upset me because with her bf and Jess I could always just talk to them about things in person and they were able to talk about it like adults and compromise with me on things. With Jane it was always the opposite. One time she tried to demand that I not park in the garage because she was here the most and it caused a big argument. She wanted the garage door opener I had and when I told her no she literally stomped her feet and stormed off like a 6 year old. 

 I felt like she was waiting for me to make the slightest mistake around the house like leave a light on or the door unlocked just so she can add it to her list of shit I’ve done wrong and send a condescending text about it later all to gain what she felt like was more control over the house. The pettiest thing was how she would get upset when I signed her out of her streaming services on the tv in the living room. I only did this when the streaming services she used had ads on them and mine did not but she refused to just use mine and would watch her shows with ads in them just cause it was her account, which I found pretty hilarious if I’m being honest. Soon she would plant herself in the living room everyday and it felt she was doing it on purpose in order to make sure I would just stay in my room. I would get pretty frustrated because I always tried to be extremely nice to her. 

One time I had a conversation with her one on one and told her about how I felt unwelcome in my own house when she was around. It actually was a great conversation and I felt like things were starting to look up. But it didn’t last long. I can go into way more but it’s all typical bad roommate behavior and this post is already extremely long so I’ll get to the main points now. 

Jane and her bf broke up and her bfs plan was to sleep on the couch until he graduated in a few months. I objected to this because I felt like using the living room as his personal room for months wasn’t what we had signed up for. After explaining this to them, I later felt bad and told Jane’s bf that he could sleep on the couch for the time being until he figures things out but that sleeping there for months wasn’t something I wanted. Jane took this as me inserting myself in their breakup but her bf seemed to understand and even continued to sleep in the same room as they separated. 

The “tipping point” was when she told me that I need to replace the garage door PIN code battery and complained about how she didn’t know it was the battery that needed to be replaced and that someone should have told her. We literally live a block away from a grocery store so I obliged and went right after I got out of my class to purchase a battery and replace it. It took me about 5 minutes. When I came inside she was sitting on the couch watching tv. In the time she took complaining about it and waiting for me to do it for her, she could have replaced it 20 times over. I told her I replaced it and she ignored me. At this point I was pissed off so I blocked her view from the tv and told her again to force a “thank you” out of her. 

I had finally had enough with being the bigger person and treating her with kindness. I felt like there was no meeting in the middle to mend this relationship and live peacefully with each other and I told myself I’d start treating her like she treats me. When her now ex bf got home I talked a lot of shit about her and the situation. I shouldn’t have done that because obviously he was still gonna tell her and yeah I was being an asshole and saying some pretty mean shit like how she needs to learn how to talk to people and how she needs therapy and is insanely entitled. This obviously got back to her and the next day she texted me telling me to stop talking shit behind her back which then started a massive argument over text where I laid out every issue I’ve had with her and vice versa. It quickly deteriorated into us just saying really hurtful things to each other. I was very mean to her as she was to me and we both said some pretty vile things. It’s by far the most “beef” I’ve had with anyone. After we stopped I was pretty content with just ignoring her forever. 

The next day I walked downstairs to get some water and she was coming up the stairs. I tried my best to ignore and avoid her. Making more and more room for her to pass by as it was clear she was not going to move out of the way to the point where I was pretty much walking sideways down the stairs. She got in my way and shoulder-checked me like a high school bully. I was shocked to the point where I laughed and said “really” before I continued on my way. Next thing I know she’s running back down the stairs to her ex telling him that I ran into her coming down the stairs. I Immediately started yelling at her telling her that that was bullshit and not what happened. It turned into a screaming match between me and her where she was yelling at me to move out and again saying some vile shit. I can’t even remember what was said because of the adrenaline but it was pretty much the same stuff said over text just in person. It got so bad that I’m surprised the cops weren’t called. 

Afterwords I was pretty much in shock. My mom told me to go straight to the police station and file a report just in case she tried to make one about me bumping into her on the stairs which I did. I knew they wouldn’t be able to do anything about it as there were no witnesses but I wanted to get the story of what actually happened on record just in case. 

After that I was preparing to either get out of there or just do what I can to avoid her at all costs. It was clear that this had gone way too far and was draining me mentally and I would have to do my best to just forget about it. But the same day of my police report she texted the group chat saying that she was dropping out of college, quitting her job, breaking the lease, and moving in with her parents, and that we would have to cover her portion of the rent. Obviously we didn’t have to cover her portion but I instantly agreed because paying an extra $200/ month was worth it to me and her ex and Jess both agreed as well. 2 days later she was gone. I think she was already thinking about dropping out of college and moving out before our last arguments because I know she owed her ex a ton of money probably because he covered her rent. It felt like she already had her decision made about dropping out and moving but wanted to put all the blame of why she did so on me. 

Now a few months have passed and I feel like I can talk about this and have a reasonable conversation about what happened to myself. There is a lot of things I could have done better but idk. That’s my story, AITAH? Any thoughts are appreciated and thanks for reading this. I’m interested in what everyone has to say.

If you're a trans woman and they get irritated or kind of shocked/pissed off, that's a fail - if they smile or continue the talk, try to get your number or whatever - that's a pass, meaning you're not only pretty/attractive but also pass. Do this a few times to be absolutely sure. 

The nod, especially gesturing upwards, can induce a whole load of feelings in a man: it either provokes positives, like devotion, attraction and familiarity - or negatives when you don't pass, and awaken deeply buried phobias, disgust, fear of their own sexuality and therefore aggression towards you. 

This can all happen within literal seconds and provoces a instant reaction to how you are perceived.  The up-nod is the most male-specific form of a nod and the most powerful of said gestures; use it cautiously. Only ever do this if you are in a safe public place and can quickly flee if things go wrong. It won't work if they're drunk or if it's dark, it's best to test this in everyday situations like going grocery shopping or when asking for a cuppa coffee.

Here are something I found about it..

Pros:
1. Encourages whole, nutrient-rich foods—can boost immunity, digestion, and mental clarity.
2. May help with weight loss and lower risk of chronic diseases.
3. Has a lower carbon footprint, so it’s more sustainable for the environment.

Cons:
1. Very restrictive—no tea, coffee, onion, garlic, or reheated food, which is tough for many.
2. Risk of nutrient deficiencies (like B12, omega-3) if not planned well.
3. Some claims lack strong scientific backing, and it can be impractical for daily life.

Scam or sustainable?
Some critics online call it a “scam” for being too commercial or making exaggerated health claims, but the core diet itself is sustainable if you balance nutrients.

DC commentary:
>! One of the regulars told me that this was her favourite template for a long time and its not too hard to see why. It does feel like an old school template from back before OTF changed everything to be ESP every day. Back then we had endurance days where it was endurance on the treads, row and floor. Strength meant inclines on the treads, slow stroke rates on the rower and heavy lifts on the floor. Today felt a bit like a throw back to those times. Very nostalgic! \
\
Two blocks on the tread. Both are deceptively difficult. When you look at it basically it is two endurance blocks with only two minutes of base in each one. For the first you have 11 and a half minutes of four build rounds. First round is a 30 second base into a minute base to push. Next round is the same 30 second base, 1 minute base to push but now you had a minute push. Next round add the minute of push to all out. Last round adds a 30 second all out at the end. You have very little recovery in all of this so expect your heart rate to quickly get into the orange and then just stay there for the entire block. \
\
Coach will ask you to remember your paces because the second block is more of the same. This time, though, the base to push efforts are now only 45 seconds. This time round, as you have had time to get warm you will quickly get your heart rate up and it will stay there for the entire block. I pushed it hard today and even managed some red splats towards the end. Good distance of 6.283km (3.9 miles). \
\
On the floor we have more endurance. First block starts with high reps on repeat. We have a forward lunge with a torso rotation for 16 reps, reverse flys and a single arm reach with rotation. Once you are done with all your reps you move to the rower for a 20 stroke row at a relatively slow 24 strokes / minute. Got through about three rounds of these exercises before the coach called it. \
\
On the second block we are doing pairs of movements - one strong and the other stable. The first pair is a single arm (suitcase) squat paired up with the single leg squat using the TRX for balance. After a short break move into the bicep curl using the strap. Two rounds of this and then you get into the next pair of exercises - this time it is a tricep kickback using a pair of dumbbells and then into a balance overhead tricep extension. I hate the balance part of this so I just went heavier and planted both feet on the floor for 10 reps. Once done you are then into the cross-back lunges using the strap for balance. Two rounds of this and then repeat all the exercises together. Your finisher today is mountain climbers for 30 seconds. \
\
Tread work is very hard today. I didn’t think the floor was anywhere near as bad as yesterday’s session. I would have given today a 2 but I was vetoed by the coffee crew so have to give it a 1 (🪶) out of 5 for gentleness. !<

All work on tech industry so money doesn’t matter. But we usually try to keep dinner under $200 and gift budget $50 each.

When it was my birthday, I did exactly that. I paid for dinner for 5 of us - my bf, my friends let’s call them Amy and Chris plus Chris gf. The bill was around $150 before tax’s and tips. Chris’s gf ordered a few extra things for herself, whatever I didn’t say anything. After dinner she packed leftovers appetizers which were order common for table for her self.

While we are at table, Amy goes like “wow, I think I’m dressed way better than the birthday girl.” I was like okay. I wore simple bodysuit and jeans it was a chill Sunday dinner at an Asian place. Wasn’t something upscale. She was wearing a simple dress, then Chris gf same remarks. I ignored I didn’t wanted to spoil my day. But honestly it stuck with me.

Fast forward to Amy’s birthday. Instead of doing our usual group dinner, she went out with Chris and gave me a two hour notice that they are doing to dinner on Monday. Which they all knew I would not make it considering I stay 45 mins away from them. She the invited me for a lunch one month latter. I thought she wanted to her birthday lunch with me I went and brought her a gift. When I got there she already order and paid for her food.

I gave her gift, we chatted a bit and I went to order my coffee. I kind of expected her to say let me get that coffee for you… it’s literally her birthday lunch I got her present and she invited me for lunch. But nope. I ended up paying for my coffee.

It’s not even about coffee, it more about principle. I spent over $150 making sure everyone had a good time, and when it was her turn she couldn’t even offer to grab a cup of coffee for me.

Now I feel hurt and confused tbh. Like I’m crazy for expecting a little bit of same efforts back.

So guys AITA, for being mad and disappointed about this!? In past I have picked up a few of her coffee or desserts order but she has never returned same efforts back.

1onls9i,https://www.reddit.com/r/exorthodox/comments/1onls9i/another_cult_experience/,Another cult experience,"I came here to post about the trauma of the last 6 months at a Bulgarian EO church which used to be a cult in the 1980s and definitely still is, but it seems that this is a very common experience in Orthodoxy.  I'm 52F, been a Christian for 25 years (Protestant but always looking longingly at what Catholics do).  Read the Bible every day, pray every day, active in my Protestant church, love the Lord etc. My son starts going to the Orthodox church and I went with him for moral support.  Then I got a strong sense that I should be there too, so I became a catechumen 6 months ago.  Lots of love bombing and joy.  

Then it very quickly started going horribly wrong.  I gave up a church I loved and so was in freefall in many ways, which is very frightening, but they did nothing to help me through that.  They treated me like I knew nothing about Christianity and everything I did know was wrong, and thinking I knew things was prideful.  Anything I thought of was possibly demonic or Satan.  Anytime I reached out when I was struggling there was dead silence, ""I didn't see your email/text"".  Offers to meet for coffee that never materialized.  Assigned a sponsor who, out of the blue, started texting me asking me if I have a ""prayer rule"", and my current practice of reading the Bible and praying in the morning isn't OK because ""Father hasn't blessed it"" which is enormously destabilizing since I've been doing that for years at this point.  The popadia corrected my son when he used his own name, instead of his baptismal name, right in front of me - I'm the one who named him!!  

Isn't this Cult 101?  I started having panic attacks and meltdowns during and after church.  I'm a grown up so this was kind of shocking.  I kept thinking I was doing something wrong. I noticed that all the women and young people were falling over themselves to do dishes and physical labor and it was obvious that that was required to be accepted.  The more heavy the physical labor, the more you'd be accepted.  The woman who ran it kept asking me to do dishes after coffee hour and I kept saying no.  I have a lot of physical pain making that hard plus I really, really didn't want to be trapped at coffee hour.  This triggered a 12 hour panic attack the last time so I just stopped going.  This was about 3 weeks ago.

Then, just a week ago the priest humiliated my son publicly - screamed at him in public and then angrily repeated something that my son had said in confession, in the hearing of other people.  After that my son was publicly removed from the men's choir, no reason given unless he'll meet in person with the priest - which is clearly just about control.  I've been absolutely horrified.  They baptized my son 6 months ago and now he's in danger of losing his faith entirely.  My son has brought this up to the bishop so we'll see if anything comes of it.  I doubt it, but he has to try.

My husband is Catholic.  He was horrified by this church right from the start.  He was on the verge of forbidding me from going due to the panic attacks and crying (and he is NOT authoritarian at all so that's how bad it was).  Now he and I are going to our local Catholic church and I actually feel like I'm home.  Beautiful building, organ, hymns I know, no weird food or words or customs or shame.  

I'm trying to put myself back together and help my son through this as well.  It's a nightmare.  I don't understand why they are allowed to treat people this way.  It's spiritual abuse.  This church is flooded with young converts who are super zealous.  It breaks my heart.  No one from there has reached out, of course, and the priests will not respond when I ask them why they did this to my son, or what he could have done to deserve it.  And as a final insult to injury, the two priests are related by marriage, which is incredibly unethical and leaves a person with no recourse at all.

Last month, I noticed the switch... shorter replies, less enthusiasm to make plans. When I brought it up, he said, “You’re overthinking. I’m just busy.” But then he’d still watch my stories minutes after I posted. If I became distant he would say ""Are u ok?, as if he just didn't want me to forget about him. 

I don’t even know what we are anymore.

I can already hear the “he’s keeping you as an option” comments. But when I’m with him, it doesn’t feel fake. It feels like something real that he’s just too scared to admit.

>The steady buzz of cooling fans filled the cramped control room. Fluorescent light reflected off half-empty coffee cups, energy drink cans, and a tangle of cables that looked one spilled latte away from catastrophe.  To put it simply, it was an IT engineer's nightmare.  That or their wet dream.  Honestly, it depended on the kind of person you asked. Rina Patel leaned back in her chair, rubbing her eyes. On the central display, the digital train schematic pulsed faintly, the test unit’s location glowing a calm, reassuring green. “Alright,” she said, yawning. “Almost done. If this thing stays on route another half hour, I’m calling it a success and going home.” Across from her, Gabe Torres was fishing around under the console's counter. “You know what success is?” his voice echoed. “Finding the power strip. I think I kicked it.” “Please don’t,” Rina said, a long suffering groan rising in her words “You remember what happened last time.” Gabe surfaced with a triumphant grin and the bag of chips he'd been searching for. “I didn’t knock out the power that bad.” He said with a lopsided grin. “Bullshit. You crashed the signal relay for an entire week,” Rina said flatly. “We had trains thinking they were in Queens when they were literally parked in the Bronx.”  “Hey, in my defense, it wasn’t labeled ‘Do Not Kick.’"" He said and Rina just rolled her eyes at the guy.


For those curious,  Rina and Gabe aren't main characters in the story, but serve as a kind of palate cleanse from the more heavy stuff the operator is seeing, and while they don't have direct interaction with him, they serve to provide an outside impression of what the operator (Marcus) is witnessing.

As doing this task was not simple as I thought and was unsuccessful as the previous tenant didn’t tie up loose ends properly. When I realised there is quite literally nothing I can do rn, and felt like nobody can really help me out - I had a breakdown where all my other thoughts came crashing down too.

One of which is feeling so dumb at work and constantly worry that my manager hired the wrong person. I do programming and have been at this company for 3 months. Today I’ve spent the morning trying to fix a problem and have had no success with it, I can’t really ask anyone in my department as they wouldn’t know. At the end of each work day, I want to end on a success so I feel better about myself, but haven’t had one today.

Also I’ve moved countries for this job, with the idea that it would hopefully make me a better person - but constantly feel like I’m not doing good enough. Socially at work I’m pretty awkward and quiet, but try to be more socially involved (go to coffee breaks or lunch with other colleagues). However, most of the time I find myself analysing every single bit of myself to the point that my constant thoughts are ‘you didn’t talk enough at lunch today, talk more tomorrow’ or ‘you didn’t make enough eye contact, need to do better next time’ and it feels exhausting. 

And my other thought that added to my break down was, looking at social media from people I know and the same old thoughts of why am I not pretty like that and why am I not extroverted enough. 

All these thoughts contributed to my breakdown earlier today, where I didn’t end up doing my errands, nor leave my bed once I got back from work and cancelled on my Spanish tutor lesson, because I didn’t feel up to it. I’ve just sat in my room mostly crying over it.

I know I’m just overthinking about all of this, but feel like I can’t talk about it with anyone. I’ve tried talking to family, but they just say I’m overthinking and not to worry. Does anyone have any advice to get over my dumb meltdowns?

1onlhok,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1onlhok,Details from John and Carolyn's honeymoon in Turkey and how the paparazzi tracked them down.,"On Sunday, September 22nd, John and Carolyn were taken to the St. Mary’s airstrip to begin their honeymoon. David Sayre, a charter pilot, had been hired to fly the couple to Miami, where they would board a private jet and be flown to Istanbul, a city John had once visited with his mother and Aristotle Onassis.

Traveling as ""Mr. and Mrs. Hyannis"", Mr. and Mrs. John F. Kennedy Jr. arrived in Istanbul and checked into their $4,500 per night penthouse suite atop the five-star Ciragan Palace Hotel, a former sultan's palazzo on the shores of the Bosporus. Christiane Amanpour, having once stayed at the same hotel, had recommended it to her friends. ""I knew the manager,"" she said, ""so I called him and requested that John and Carolyn be extended every possible courtesy. I expressed the need for privacy. I asked him to place a basket with Turkish bread, honey, and fruit in their suite. Bread and honey are the traditional components of a postwedding breakfast in Turkey. As far as the hotel is concerned, it's one of the most luxurious in the world, even by Kennedy standards."" There were complimentary champagne and other delicacies including Turkish delight candies, fresh fruits and chocolates awaiting them as well.

The newlyweds had the phone to their room shut off and didn't emerge until they had breakfast next morning on the balcony of their fifth-floor suite. ""They ordered freshly squeezed orange juice, a basket of freshly baked croissants with honey and butter and ate while watching sailboats and yachts glide by on the Bosphorus,"" says the source. ""After breakfast, they dressed casually and toured the hotel, while holding bands and exchanging little pecks on the cheek”. The couple hired a cabdriver to give them a guided tour, visiting the Blue Mosque, the Hagia Sophia Church, and the Grand Bazaar, where John bought Carolyn a jewelry box. John impulsively stopped the cab, jumped out and bought Carolyn a small carved ivory jewelry box. “It was so spontaneous and sweet” says the source.

That evening they dined on the patio at the Tugra, one of several chic restaurants owned by the Ciragan Palace. After breakfast the next morning, they walked around, stopping at stalls along the Bosporus to sample the wares. They stopped at a café for honey cake and cups of Turkish coffee. At lunchtime they dropped into a local McDonald's for a taste of home. Looking like typical American tourists, they went largely unnoticed and unrecognized except by other American tourists. When a busload of midwesterners saw them walking down the street and began yelling at them out the windows, they vanished into a crowded clothing store. Here and there a local merchant recognized them. A sidewalk vendor of rugs called him John-John and asked if he wanted to buy a carpet. ""No thanks,"" said John.

They then returned to their suite and didn't come out again until late in the afternoon. The maids said later the bed was constantly rumpled. John then took a swim alone in the hotel pool and read USA Today on a chaise lounge, admiring the front-page photo of his wedding and chuckling over reports that he was honeymooning on a yacht off Georgia. 

Later, the couple went to dinner about 8:30 p.m. with John wearing a white shirt, white jeans, brown shoes and a black headband and Carolyn dressed in an ivory top with black pants. ""He told me to take him to the most romantic restaurant in Istanbul,"" their cab driver Hafiz said. ""I took them to Korfez, a seafood restaurant where they could sit on the terrace on the water's edge. They had Turkish hors d'oeuvres, a sea bass cooked at tableside and hot Turkish coffee. On the way back to the hotel, she snuggled in his arms. He gave me a $14 tip, the biggest I've ever gotten for such a short ride."" Afterwards, they went to a nightclub to watch a performance of the whirling dervishes. Emil Gabron, manager of the club, sent the couple a complimentary bottle of champagne. ""They were both very sweet,"" said Gabron.

Globe Magazine had dispatched New York photographer Russell Turiak to Turkey in search of the newlyweds. He found them.
""I suppose somebody tipped off Globe to the fact that they were honeymooning in Istanbul,""
said Turiak. ""They put me on the next plane,
and I'd just arrived at the hotel. I was just looking around when I chanced upon John Jr. at the swimming pool. He recognized me from New York. He gave me a look as if to say, 'Could that be you?"" I ducked back into the hotel, where I met up with John Bell, a British guy who headed up Globe's European bureau. We sat down and discussed strategy. An hour later we caught a real break. We were looking at brochures near the travel agent's office in the lobby, and we saw JFK Jr.—he was standing there talking with the agent. They were going over his travel itinerary. So John Bell innocently strolled into the agent's office and overheard their conversation. We now knew where John and Carolyn were headed after Istanbul.""

The couple also toured the city's ancient museums, mosques and churches with a blonde tour guide. The two toured the ruins at Ephesus, one of the ancient Seven Wonders of the World, and enjoyed a breakfast of Turkish coffee, freshly baked bread and scrambled eggs at a roadside cafe. At the next table, ten vacationing magazine editors from New York, oblivious to the newlyweds’ presence, chatted about having spotted the couple in the bazaar earlier that day. “He was gorgeous,” one of the women at the table gushed. “She was with him, and let me tell you, that woman is no beauty queen.” When someone else in the group described her as “cute,” the woman replied, “Nah, Julie Nixon is better looking than she is.” It was only then that they realized the honeymooners were sitting immediately behind them. “His back was to us and sort of hunched down—clearly they heard every word,” recalled one of editors. Carolyn “stared at us the entire time they were there. She looked like she wanted to come over and stab us with a fork.”

Early the next day, Russell Turiak positioned himself in front of the Ciragan Palace. ""John and Carolyn came out at about 10:00 a.m.,"" recalled the photographer. ""He was wearing shorts and a baseball cap. She had on dark glasses, like a movie star. The bell captain put them in a cab, and off they went. I managed to get a few shots but nothing spectacular. John Bell said to me, 'Get a cab and go after them.' By the time I climbed into a cab, they were long gone, and I had no idea where they were headed. 'Where do the tourists go?"" I asked the driver. ""The old part of the city,' he said, so I told him to take me there. I walked around the Bazaar for a while, past a lot of historic sites. Istanbul is a big city, and I'd just about given up hope when I spotted them coming out of the Blue Mosque.”

“John had a sort of built-in antenna developed after years of being stalked by the press. He saw me standing on the other side of the street. I followed lowed them around, snapping pictures. And then he stopped. He took Carolyn's hand, and he kissed it, a replica of the shot of them emerging from the little church on Cumberland Island after they were married. He held her hand to his lips for a few seconds, and I took the shot. It was a fabulous picture, and he knew it. He basically posed for me. And at this point he shot me a glance, like, 'Okay, I gave you the shot. You've got it. Now get lost.' So I gave him a little sign, like 'Bye-bye? And that was it, at least for the day.""

Aware of John's itinerary, Russell Turiak and the rest of the group from Globe were at the airport in Istanbul when John and Carolyn arrived to begin the second leg of their honeymoon—a sojourn to the Aegean Sea.
Unseen by the newlyweds, the Globe crew huddled at the rear of the plane. Less than an hour later, they landed at İzmir. John and Carolyn climbed into the backseat of a Mercedes. A car driven by a Globe reporter picked up Turiak and the others, and the gang of four proceeded to follow the Mercedes.

""I don't think they knew they were being tailed,"" said Turiak. ""Their driver certainly didn't know. After about an hour, the Mercedes stopped John and Carolyn stepped out and strolled to a nearby café. They sat outdoors and had coffee and cakes. We were parked across the road, and I took some 'tender moments' shots. They got back in their car, and we followed them to Ephesus. They drove slowly, sightseeing along the way. And then they suddenly pulled over and stopped. We pulled over as well. John stepped out of the car and folded his arms. He glared at us. The reporter at the wheel of our car also clambered out, went over to him, and said, 'Can you give us a comment and pose for a photo?"" John wasn't pleased. 'Look,' he said, Im on my honeymoon. I'm not going to do this.' I got out of the car and walked over to them. 'How about a picture?' I asked. 'You again’, he said. 

He got back in the Mercedes, and they drove away. So now the jig was up. He realized we’d picked up his itinerary at the travel agent's office in Istanbul. They'd be sure to be on the lookout. We followed them into a parking lot at Ephesus. Other cars pulled in behind us. When they saw that we were boxed in, they turned around and sped out of the lot. We remained in Ephesus a few more days but never saw them again, so we decided to call it quits. We'd gotten what we came for—some exclusive footage of John and Carolyn gallivanting around Istanbul. It filled the next two issues of Globe.""

John and Carolyn spent the remainder of their honeymoon cruising the Greek Isles. Their honeymoon had to be cut three days short to interview Billy Graham for George Magazine. Billy Graham is quoted as saying: “John and his wife, Carolyn, came home from their honeymoon three days early to interview me for his magazine, ‘George.’ We had a wonderful time together, and I could see a great deal of love between them.""

1onlg6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUSROG/comments/1onlg6o/super_ultra_premium_asus_rog_azoth_keyboard_and/,Super ultra premium Asus Rog Azoth Keyboard and Rog Keris 2 Ace Driver issue,"I recently purchased the ROG Azoth keyboard and ROG Keris 2 Ace mouse, a set considered ""super premium"" and ""super expensive"" from the absolute top tier of the market. I trusted the ASUS brand and its reputation for quality, paying a significant premium far above market standards, believing I was getting a superior product.

However, my experience has been a complete disappointment. The problem is that the drivers for these products do not work correctly with Windows 11; the system misidentifies the devices, even with a wired connection.

You can see exactly how pathetic the situation is in the Device Manager:

1. **ROG Azoth Keyboard:** Shows up under the ""Mouse"" category.
2. **ROG Keris 2 Ace Mouse:** Shows up under both the ""Keyboard"" and ""Mouse"" categories.

This fundamental software flaw leads to a critical, system-locking issue: When the computer restarts, neither my keyboard nor my mouse works on the Windows login screen. I can't even enter my password to log in because the system doesn't detect any input.

I have exhausted all possible solutions:

* I tried different USB ports, but the result was the same.
* I contacted ASUS support and followed all their instructions to the letter, yet the problem remains unsolved.
* As a last resort, I formatted my system and reinstalled Windows 11; even this did not fix the situation.

It is blatantly obvious that this is purely a software issue. When I researched the problem, I found that other users on asus forums and across the internet or reddit experienced this **exact same issue 1 year ago** and never found a solution.

It is unbelievable that a giant like ASUS has been unable to fix a known driver issue for an entire year—a critical flaw that prevents their most expensive products from performing their basic function. Apparently, instead of writing drivers, ASUS engineers are busy drinking tea, drinking coffee, and counting their money.

1onlbhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1onlbhw/filter_basket_keeps_sticking_to_group_head_quick/,filter basket keeps sticking to group head [Quick Mill 3000/Eureka Mignon Specialita],"Hey fellow espresso enthusiasts,

I’m running into a persistent issue with my Quick Mill 3000 espresso machine and hoping for some advice.

The filter basket keeps sticking to the group head after pulling a shot — it doesn’t stay in the portafilter when I remove it. I clean my machine about once a week and lubricate the group gasket with silicone grease. That usually helps for a short while, but the problem always comes back.

I’ve already replaced the spring in the portafilter that’s supposed to hold the basket in place. I’ve also recently replaced the group gasket and the shower screen (the plate and screw assembly), so those should be in good condition. I’m using the original Quick Mill filter basket.

I’ve read that this can also happen when you’re overdosing the basket. I’m using an Eureka Mignon Specialita grinder. It was set around 2 (fairly fine), and I was dosing about 9 grams. I recently reduced that to 8 grams and made the grind even a bit finer (around 1.5).

When I tamp, I can still see that the shower screen screw leaves a mark in the puck, which I’ve heard means there’s too much coffee in the basket. But when I lower the dose any further, the coffee just doesn’t taste as good.

Since lowering the dose, I’ve also noticed that some water remains on top of the puck after pulling a shot, which didn’t happen before.

I’m using Lavazza Oro beans, and my brew pressure usually goes up to around 12 bar during extraction.

So my main questions are:
	•	Should I reduce the coffee dose even more, or adjust grind size instead?
	•	Could the basket or gasket still be part of the issue, even though they’re new?
	•	Any other tips to keep the basket from sticking to the group head?

Thanks in advance for any advice — I’ve been trying to dial this in for weeks and can’t quite get it right.

We share a very deep connection — we understand each other’s cultures, have the same goals for the future, the same humor, and a shared desire to support and grow together. I truly feel like he’s my soulmate; I’ve never had such a connection with anyone else before.
But… of course, there’s a “but,” or I wouldn’t be here.

When we first started dating, we were both younger and less experienced. Even back then, he struggled with his desire to “hunt” and flirt with other women. He’s very extroverted and loves talking to everyone, but the issue was that he still kept contact with his ex and sometimes crossed boundaries — they had regular calls, went out for coffee, and he even called her “baby” a few times.

At the same time, I started feeling curious about being single and exploring life and other guys — probably because my trust had already been shaken, and he was only my second boyfriend ever. Eventually, we broke up, though it was a friendly split, and barely had contact for a year. That year apart was actually good for both of us; we grew and explored individually.

Life eventually brought us back together. We started talking again, realized how much we’d missed each other, and had honest conversations about our past relationship — our weaknesses, needs, and hopes for the future. We decided to truly commit to each other and communicate openly. He told me he was ready to fully commit and had finally “found answers” to his need for chasing other women.

That was a few years ago, and since then, we’ve built a strong relationship centered on open communication…(or so I thought)

Recently, though, he confessed that he still struggles with sexual desires for other women. I appreciated his honesty — especially because he knows I don’t condone cheating and would end the relationship if he ever crossed that line, even though he’s the love of my life. I’m not overly strict or controlling and don’t mind harmless flirting as long as he stays respectful. He said he wouldn’t act on those desires but wanted to talk openly so we could work through it together.

I’ll admit it was hard to hear, and I told him I’m not ready to explore anything beyond occasional flirting anytime soon. He said he respected that, wouldn’t pressure me, and would never cheat.

Fast forward a few months — I had a few bad dreams about him cheating and, on impulse, looked through his phone (something I never do; we both have open access to each other’s phones). In his archived messages, I saw that he’s still talking to his ex. Not every day, but every few weeks or months. They’ve planned to meet a few times, had phone calls lasting over 30 minutes, he called her “my queen,” and she even sent him a link about orgasmic meditation. Ah yes, because nothing says emotional boundaries like guided climax sessions….😒

Honestly, I feel numb. It hurts, but I’m not ready to let it fully sink in yet. I still need to confront him, but I’m afraid of what that conversation might lead to. I don’t want to break up — outside of this, our relationship has been better than ever. We’re both very invested, and we spend most of our free time together.

Am I delusional for believing we could get past this if we work on it — maybe with therapy? Or is this a huge red flag that means I should walk away, even though everything else feels so right?

To what extent should you stick, compromise, and fight for your marriage?

Sorry for the long post — I’d really appreciate any advice or insights.

This may be a long one. I will be completely fair from both sides of how we both feel so I can get unbiased help. 

Me 31F and my boyfriend 37M have been dating for the past 5 months, but we have known each other and have been friends for 13 years. We used to work together back in the day and how we initially met.  We always had a connection, and I had come over and stayed over (sometimes with groups of friends and sometimes alone) at his house from time to time. Needless to say, I’ve known his dog since he has gotten him, he is now 11.5 years old. 
In December I moved back to my home state after leaving a very toxic relationship for 3 across the country. After giving myself time to heal, my (now) boyfriend and I rekindled and decided to take it a step farther. 

I started staying the night at his house every night and he eventually decided we should just move in together, it made sense! At first, the dog had absolutely no problem, he loved the extra company and especially since he knew me well! Always greeting me at the door, cuddling, kissing, bringing me toys to play with- it was great! When bf would have to leave for work (we work different schedules some days), I’d be the full care taker. Walking, play time, meds, lovin and pettin- you know, the works! Things started seeming to get more aggressive and I noticed he was in some type of pain with his ears. I suspected an ear infection and informed bf about it. I reminded him to call the vet- he did. 3 separate times. He missed all 3 vet appts because of conflicting meetings he forgot and doesn’t like to use a calendar (eye roll). Finally we got him in, indeed it was, and we got him healed up. 
I noticed the aggression kind of came from the pain so I dismissed that, so once he was all better I thought it wouldn’t be an issue. I was wrong. Mind you, this is a smaller dog, think like a corgi mix of some sort. I was cleaning up his toys behind the couch, which is where he likes to perch to look out the window, and once I stood up he bit me so hard in the face I will forever have a permanent scar. His incisors pierced through 2 parts of my lip and there are massive bite marks noticeable on my face to this day. It was a bloody mess! 

I called my bf, he came home from work immediately he was bawling his eyes out and profusely apologized and kept hugging me. TURNS OUT the same thing happened to his other friend 2 weeks before and had to get stitched up at the ER. Then I asked how many times he’s ever bit and he said 6 more. I was perplexed. I suggested dog training, even made an appointment but that got missed too and he didn’t call back. (I think he believes since he’s so old that he can’t learn new tricks, but this dog is so active and runs around like a puppy). Since that happened, I notice that his aggression is hot and cold. It’s like an “eff you, I love you, eff you, I love you” kind of temperament. I think he is territorial maybe, but these occurrences are unprovoked. For instance, when he was jumping on the coffee table to try to eat my food and I said “no” in a stern voice, he showed his teeth and tried to nip my ankle. 
The other day he was sitting next to me on the couch being loving, soon as his dad left the room, he got up, stood in the hallway where he had walked, and growled at me with his teeth again. I called bfs name and he came back and dog went right back to perked up ears and a tail wag.

I have told bf about my concerns and how I don’t think he’s taking it as seriously as he should, and he agrees, but I feel like he’s doing the bare minimum. I understand me being in his house all the time instead of just visiting is different. I think he may be jealous that his dad’s attention isn’t 100 percent on him anymore. He always wants to be a part of when we are romantic or cuddling and inserts himself onto his dad and makes direct eye contact with me lol.


The last straw is when we went on an overnight camping trip. This was the first time in a looong while we could have a night alone since he works nights. He wanted to bring the dog but besides normal annoyances I didn’t feel comfortable being in a tent (1 room obviously) with the dog. At home I can move into a separate room if needed. As expected, the second bf left the tent to grab something out of the car, he nipped at me again. These are only a few instances, I have been bit a total of 7 times with 2 breaking skin- the worst one is on my face.  My bf is the most loving, caring, sweetest soul, loves his dog more than anything, loyal, kind, literally the closest to perfect a man could be, with minimal flaws but this is causing much resentment in this relationship. I also have a cat who is my absolute love but since the dog would literally kill him I can’t have them together and that hurts my heart and causes resentment too. He stays with my mom and I visit him but I miss sleeping with and being around him. 

After that long winded story, I guess I need advice in the relationship dynamic and the dog dynamic and the fact I feel like I’m bending my own boundaries to keep the peace but also want this to work out. It reminds me of blending families that have difficult times. 

TLDR; bf dog bit my face badly, is aggressive and abusive on and off and idk what to do. 


Dog is currently laying next to me. Hopefully doesn’t awake into a gremlin. 

How do I go about this?

after all of this i did have a crash where my emotions were crashing and i was questioning why i was even happy and i js felt off.. 

i ended up having a 2nd cup a few hours later after the first one and i continued to talk more clearly and find eye contact a little easier. my head wasnt as clear and my thoughts still sidetracked but i articulated myself sm better today.

ik its not recommended to take coffee w adhd meds but it also affects everyone differently. the thing is i need to see how my meds work without the coffee and caffeine but i feel really tempted to drink more now and tmr to have that feeling back.

**Why This Pick?**



Dallas has cashed the Over in their last 5 straight games, friends – and 6 of the 8 outings they’ve had have gone well over 54 points. Between the Cardinals being rested, Kyler Murray (potentially?) coming back, and the juggernaut offense but lacklustre defense of the Cowboys…this encounter should be no exception to the high-scoring trend. To boot, the Cardinals have lost their last 5 straight; I just don’t think either squad has the defensive chops to keep this total from going through the roof. My money’s on the Over to cash this evening.

We are budgeting $5,500 and we are thinking about a lot of neighborhoods so we can use your help narrowing and editing our list. Here are the neighborhoods we are considering: UES, Williamsburg, Brooklyn Heights, Park Slope, and Prospect Heights. 

The commute is one of the bigger factors in this decision. I commute 3x/week to Midtown East around Grand Central on Third Ave and my SO commutes to Times Square area, so we were looking for something with access to both relatively easily. 

We are homebodies most of the time and usually only go out socially once a week. That said, we don’t want the neighborhood to be completely dead. We would prefer some proximity to coffee shops, some restaurants and maybe a local bar or something.

I have tried EVERYTHING that is commonly suggested for fighting hunger and losing weight and it does NOT work.

What I ate yesterday: 2 cups of boiled sweet potato, 3 fried eggs, an apple with peanut butter and honey, a protein shake, a bowl of greek yogurt with bananas and nuts. This was about 1800 calories.

That was a good day, because I wasn't too hungry, probably because it was a rest day and because the day before I ate everything that was listed there... and two large tacos, and half an avocado on two big (like probably 1.5x normal size) slices of bread, and four eggs. It added up to 3600 calories.

I drink a lot of water (in general about 150-200oz). I drink at least 3 cups of coffee a day. I get my protein and fiber in.

I've tried eating copious amounts of vegetables. For a snack today I ate approximately 5 cups of tomatoes and peppers. I'm still hungry. Had a diet coke. Still hungry.

I've tried skipping breakfast. Doesn't make a difference. I've tried eating a big breakfast. Nope. I've tried going on walks. They usually end with me buying food because I spend the whole walk thinking about it. I don't eat added sugar.

I weigh everything. I lift weights. I spend 2 or 3 hours a day reading to try to keep my mind busy and off food. I chew a pack of gum a day. I mean seriously, what more is there? I'm exhausted.

I’m constantly hungry. I’m fatigued all the time. When I sleep, I dream of food. When I eat, I’m instantly hungry again.

Look, we’ve all been to those fancy fundraisers where the raffle prizes are insane and you’re thinking “who approved THAT budget?!” Meanwhile, I’m over here trying to make $25 stretch into something people actually want to win lol

This guide breaks down 15 different basket ideas that don’t require selling a kidney to fund. The thing I love most? They tell you EXACTLY where to shop (Dollar Tree for the win) and how to make cheap stuff look fancy with just tissue paper and ribbon. Like, actual practical advice instead of “just spend more money.”

Some ideas I’m definitely stealing:

* A movie night basket (popcorn, candy, maybe a $10 streaming gift card)
* Coffee lover’s bundle that’s basically just grocery store stuff arranged nicely
* That garden starter one with seeds, small tools, and a planting guide

What blew my mind was realizing people actually prefer these themed baskets over random expensive junk thrown together. Turns out if you create something that feels like a complete experience, people go nuts for it even if the individual items aren’t fancy.

I’ve already tested the garden starter basket idea at our last mini-fundraiser and it was a HUGE hit. Cost me less than $25 total! Just grabbed some seed packets from the dollar store, cute little garden tools from Target clearance, a small watering can, and printed a simple planting guide. Wrapped it all in green tissue paper with a terracotta pot on top. Some plant mom literally squealed when she won it.

I’m also someone who’s only met “mean” cats. Cats that, looking back at what I know now, were poorly socialized, had shitty owners, were abused or otherwise neglected. 

I adopted my Maisy (ex-name being Narco, as she was rescued from a rural drug bust (meth lab farm area downstate). I adopted her from a very sweet cat sanctuary not far from my home, when I was learning to live on my own, in my own place, after severe burnout. 

This lavender, soft cream colored runt of the litter saved my life. Resting on my chest when days felt excruciatingly difficult, purring into my bones, helping me rest. She hunts me and I hunt her, having loads of fun every morning while I make my coffee and put in my contacts. She rides my shoulders around as I make toast or brush my teeth, purring into my ear, content to watch my every move. 

She looks for me when I go on vacation, my folk say. She’ll watch the door, despite them being there to feed her and play with her. 

I’ve never been so deeply attached to a cat, and it’s a shame I only met good ones in my mid 20’s, mid 30’s.

I used to say I was on carnivore, then keto, but now I honestly have no idea what this diet is. Since I started I have lost up to 22 pounds (used to be 203 and have since weighed in at 181) and I sleep better and my joints hurt less and I don't intend to stop I kinda just don't know what the heck my diet is now that I'm not counting carbs from fruit.

I brushed, flossed (well, most of the time), and visited my dentist twice a year. Still, every check-up ended with the same conversation — plaque buildup, gum sensitivity, and the warning that I might “need to consider deep cleaning soon.”

I’ll be honest — it got discouraging. I wasn’t neglecting my teeth, but no matter what toothpaste or mouthwash I tried, my gums still felt sore sometimes, and my breath wasn’t as fresh as I wanted it to be. My wife started teasing me about my “coffee breath,” and I laughed it off, but deep down, it bugged me.

Last winter, things got worse. My gums started bleeding when I brushed. I could literally taste that metallic tang, and it scared me. My dentist said it was early gum disease and wanted to schedule another cleaning. That night, I sat in front of the mirror and thought, “How did it get this bad?”

I started reading about natural oral health routines — what helps balance bacteria, what supports gum repair, what actually strengthens enamel. I ended up stumbling across a discussion where someone mentioned how they’d restored their gum health using a daily supplement that supports the mouth’s microbiome.

At first, I thought it sounded like another trend, but the way they described it made sense — it wasn’t about cleaning harder, it was about helping your mouth stay balanced from the inside out. So, I decided to give it a shot.

The first few days didn’t seem like much, but after about two weeks, I noticed something subtle — my gums weren’t bleeding anymore. My mouth felt fresher in the morning, even before brushing. That dull ache along my gumline? Gone. And honestly, my confidence came back with it. I found myself smiling more without even thinking about it.

Fast forward two months, and my dentist was shocked. He said my gums looked healthier than they had in years and asked what I’d changed. When I told him, he was curious but also impressed.

[I don’t usually share stuff like this, but if you’ve been dealing with sore gums, bleeding, or that feeling like your mouth’s just never clean enough, I get it — it wears you down. For me, finding ProvaDent was the turning point. It didn’t just help my teeth; it gave me back that feeling of confidence every time I smiled.](https://freezegluco.com/ProvaDent.html)

Lately I’ve realized something about myself  I’m often drawn to women who are a bit younger than me. It’s not really about age; it’s more about the energy. I naturally fall into that soft, nurturing role the kind who loves to look after her, make her coffee, listen to her vent, or wrap her up in a hug when she’s had a rough day.

There’s something incredibly romantic about that dynamic  playful and warm, but also steady and comforting. I don’t want to “lead” anyone; I just love that feeling of being someone’s calm, safe place while still having that spark and chemistry.

Anyone else feel the same? Or maybe you’re someone who likes that older-partner energy  that mix of flirty affection and quiet care. I’d love to hear how that dynamic feels from your side too 💞

1onkc6y,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalkLikeAnAdult/comments/1onkc6y/microbehaviors_people_use_when_they_secretly_feel/,# **Micro-behaviors people use when they secretly feel UNCOMFORTABLE around you (but won’t say it out loud)**,"Saw a friend group slowly fall apart last year. Not because of drama. Not because of betrayal. But because of subtle tension no one could explain or name. The weird vibes weren’t loud, but they were real. You’ve probably felt this too, those lowkey moments when someone stiffens up, adjusts their tone, or completely changes once you enter the room. Most of us brush this off. But those *tiny signals*? They matter. They add up.

This post breaks down those subtle cues, aka “micro-behaviors”, that show someone might feel uneasy around you. This isn’t a call-out or a guilt trip. Most people do this subconsciously. And it’s not always your fault. There are a thousand reasons why people feel tense around others: power dynamics, miscommunication, social anxiety, past trauma, even just a bad day. But if you want to be more socially aware (and avoid misunderstandings), learning to read these signs is a damn good idea.

This isn’t TikTok-psycho babble. Everything here is pulled from peer-reviewed psych research, insider insights from behavioral coaches, bestselling books, and solid podcasts. I skipped the clickbait fluff. Let’s get into it.

*Micro-behaviors people show when they’re uncomfortable around you:*

- **Their smile doesn’t reach their eyes**
  - Known as a “Duchenne smile,” a real smile engages both mouth and the muscles around the eyes. If they’re smiling just with their lips but their eyes look dead? Something’s off.
  - Referenced in *The Like Switch* by Jack Schafer (ex-FBI behavior analyst). He says fake smiles are one of the easiest ways to spot discomfort fast.

- **They face their feet away from you**
  - This one shows up in so many body language studies because it’s almost impossible to fake. People point their feet toward what they want. If their toes are facing the door, or anyone else but you, it’s a sign they wanna leave or shift away from the interaction.
  - Cited in research published in *Evolution and Human Behavior* (Vrij et al., 2010), which found people unconsciously orient their bodies toward where their mind wants to go.

- **They touch their neck, face, or arm too much**
  - Self-soothing gestures. People fiddle with jewelry, scratch their neck, rub their forearm…usually when they feel nervous or judged.
  - Behavioral psychologist Dr. Lillian Glass calls these ""pacifying behaviors”, little things we do to calm ourselves when stressed. They can also pop up in interviews or when someone feels emotionally threatened.

- **Their laughter is too short or delayed**
  - A real laugh is instant and spontaneous. If you drop a joke and they laugh half a second later, or stop laughing quicker than the rest, that’s not rhythm, it’s emotional lag.
  - Vanessa Van Edwards (author of *Captivate*) says awkward laughter is one of the most common cues of social discomfort. It’s not about humor. It’s about whether someone emotionally *syncs* with you.

- **They avoid eye contact in key moments**
  - Not just looking away randomly, but avoiding your gaze when you're sharing something vulnerable, serious, or personal. That’s not just distraction, it’s emotional avoidance.
  - Cited in research from the *Journal of Nonverbal Behavior*, which found that sustained eye contact during emotional disclosure is key to building trust and psychological safety.

- **They over-agree or nod too much**
  - Ironically, too much agreement can be a sign someone’s checked out or just wants the convo to end. Especially when their responses get shorter (“yeah,” “totally,” “for sure”) or they don’t add anything new.
  - Harvard social psychologist Amy Cuddy notes that excessive nodding or vocal affirming is often a signal of trying to appease, not connect.

- **They create mini barriers**
  - Holding their bag in their lap. Crossing their arms while shifting away. Hugging their coffee cup like it's a shield. Even placing a phone face-up between you as a physical buffer.
  - These are literal boundary-setting cues. In *What Every BODY is Saying*, former FBI agent Joe Navarro breaks down how people subtly erect “barriers” when they want distance, emotional or physical.

*If you’ve noticed these signs and felt confused, you’re not paranoid. They’re real.*

Here’s where it gets deeper: some people constantly make others uncomfortable without meaning to. It’s not about being a “bad person.” Sometimes it’s tone, intensity, energy mismatch, or just habits we never question. The good news? You can 100% become more socially attuned and emotionally safe for others. These tools helped me, and a bunch of others, tune into (and improve) our social presence:

- *Insanely good book rec that changes how you read people:*
  - **""Captivate: The Science of Succeeding with People"" by Vanessa Van Edwards**
    - #1 Wall Street Journal bestseller. Vanessa is a behavioral investigator who teaches at MIT and Google. The book blends science-backed cues with real life stories on reading emotions, building liking, and spotting social friction early.
    - I wanted to rewatch every social interaction in my life after reading it. One of the most accessible and *addicting* reads on social intelligence. This is the best book I’ve ever read about understanding subtle social dynamics.

- *Want an app that builds emotional intelligence on autopilot?*  
  - **BeFreed**: This AI-powered learning app, built by a Columbia University team, personalizes your audio learning based on your emotional and mental goals. It pulls from expert books, TED talks, psychology journals, and even success stories.
    - You pick topics like emotional literacy, leadership, or confidence. It auto-generates podcasts in your voice/tone of choice, mine is a warm, sarcastic British guy. It even builds you a custom roadmap that evolves the more you listen.  
    - Best part? It has an entire track on “Reading People,” “Creating Psychological Safety,” and “Charisma Without Being Fake.” Perfect for subtle social glow-ups.

- *App that helps you track social habits & energy patterns:*
  - **Finch**: This isn’t just a to-do tracker. It gamifies self-care by helping you track social goals like “active listening,” “fewer interruptions,” or “validate someone’s story.” Helps you become the friend who doesn’t make people squirm.

- *Podcast that makes social psychology sound thrilling:*
  - **""Hidden Brain"" by Shankar Vedantam**
    - Super bingeable. Covers why people act weird in relationships, friendships, work settings, and how tiny habits betray big emotions. The “You 2.0” episodes? Iconic.

- *Another app that helps with inner social anxiety:*
  - **Ash**: Great mental wellness app from Stanford-trained therapists. Offers real-time journaling prompts + CBT-based check-ins. Especially helpful if *you* feel like the one who’s uncomfortable in groups or constantly over-analyzing convos.

- *YouTube gem that breaks down body language:*
  - **Carol Kinsey Goman’s channel**
    - She’s consulted for companies like Google and Salesforce. Her breakdowns of leadership presence, trust signals, and “unspoken resistance” are so damn good. Quick videos, easy to digest.

- *An underrated book that helps you be less socially “loud”:*
  - **""The Power of the Subtle: Mastering the Quiet Art of Influence"" by Susan Cain**
    - Same author as *Quiet*, this book is for people who want to lead or connect without dominating. It teaches how gentleness, silence, and awareness can be more powerful than performance.

Once you start paying attention, you’ll notice micro-behaviors *everywhere*. Not to over-analyze, but to tune in. To respond better. To stop forcing connections that feel off. And to create space where people actually feel good around you. That’s real charisma.",1,1762195834.0,TalkLikeAnAdult,0,1.0,False
1onkc2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/BadRPerStories/comments/1onkc2q/the_ai_character_thief/,The AI Character Thief,"I've only recently discovered this sub after being an avid writer and RPer for years, albeit only dipping my toes back into collaborative writing in the past three years after a several year hiatus. I thought this might be the perfect space to share a minor horror story that I experienced a few months ago!

My main avenue of roleplay is an incredibly popular MMO and I happen to have a very small presence within the community through posting edited ingame screenshots of my muse and sharing lore snippets about her. Through this community, I've met several others who share similar aesthetics and even have similar lore; after all, we're working with and bending the same universe. Many of these people have become some of my very best friends OOC!

Now, with all that said, enter Coffee (fake name.) One day, I received a DM from a friend about a character named Coffee that looked suspiciously like mine which sometimes happens and I briefly waved it off but my friend insisted that I look over the links that she provided for me. The social media links provided and the attached carrd were... damning.

Coffee had done everything within her power to make her character look exactly like mine albeit unable to do so because I am an avid commissioner of private mods to help suit my vision for my character. Many of her pictures were nearly 1:1 of mine, often even using the exact captions. One such picture actually used my own username as a caption.

Then I checked out the carrd... It was \*exactly\* mine. Same preset, same same changes I did to the carrd for my own tastes, same obscure metal song lyrics placed in certain spots... And then I noticed something odd about the syntax and grammar. So I ran the carrd through multiple different AI-detectors and found that the carrd was anywhere from 73-91% AI generated. This person had taken my carrd and my writing to run through AI to take for their own, only changing extremely minuscule details.

Curiously, I checked some of the Discords where people often post roleplay ads for the game we both play and I found theirs. Their entire Discord profile was \*mine\* except they had changed my frog emojis to rabbits. Mind you, I have NO idea who this person is. I ended up reporting them to the server admins, who summarily deleted their ads and banned them as they were equally disturbed.

After this, Coffee deleted all of her socials upon realizing they were caught. It was such a surreal experience that somehow managed to encapsulated some of the horrors we all have to experience in RP: stalking, AI, theft, boundary crossing, creepiness.

I hope that, while this was stressful for me in the moment, others can find a laugh in this experience and pat themselves on the back for their own normalness. Happy writing, everyone!",2,1762195826.0,BadRPerStories,1,1.0,False

1onkaw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Catholicism/comments/1onkaw0/struggling_to_understand_what_gods_purpose_is_for/,Struggling to understand what God's purpose is for me in my life,"My story started when I was 16 in 2013, and that year, two of my best High School friends passed away. One by a car accident, and then a close friend of mine committed suicide in grief over our friend's dying, leaving in his Instagram bio for the rest of time to read, ""I'll see you one day, buddy.""

The last time I saw my best friend, with whom I had homeroom class every day, was at my friend's funeral. 

Then, before that, he was expelled from school for becoming behaviorally reckless and bringing a bottle of alcohol to school to drink throughout the day. Right before he was caught and arrested at school. He saw me in his last class of homeroom, where he tried to get me to take the bottle from him ""because they were onto him."" 



I said no because I didn't want to get in trouble myself. I could've easily taken that bottle and stashed it or trashed it somewhere from my book bag, and he would've possibly never gotten caught with it. He was acting like a fool, and his breath reeked. I still second-guess this.

When I turned 17 in 2014, my Senior year of High School. A girl met me, and it was love at first sight for me. 

The week I met her, I experienced what the Doctor at the Hospital called a ""First break, prodromal psychosis"". 

During my first ""episode,"" I experienced my first Command Hallucination phrases from auditory hallucinations and delusions. 

In my new homeroom class, after being transferred from my friend’s passing away. Meeting all new people that year, I met this girl over the weekend at a school soccer game. She was very shy the last time we met. She approached me without saying a word, outlined my stenciled ""Stussy"" shirt with her finger, and asked what it meant. She was very coy, didn't say a word to me, blushed, smiled, and ran off laughing.

The people I sat with in school were talking about meeting her at a party over the same weekend that I met her at a soccer game. 

They were talking about taking advantage of her and trying to get her drunk so they could ""Bring her to the back room and hook up with her."" It sounded like they were trying to rape her. I jumped out of my skin emotionally and lashed out verbally. Attempting to fight one of my classmates, 

These were the group and type of kids that my friend group and my type of people hated morally, and we rivaled. One of my other best friends at the time was Jeremiah, and he was my best friend with my now-dead friend. Kicked in this guy's car door, who was Alex, and his friends, because they came by his house to punk him. The guy who was hosting this party with all his douchebag friends, the girl I liked, was at. 

The same guy, the owner of the house party, and his girlfriend, cheated on him with me at age 15 because she said she hated him. 

We were considered ""Rat or trashy"" by this other ""In-group,"" and she Hope was just meeting these people for the first time that night. I was attempting to protect her from these awful people, and that's simply what I was trying to do: save my love for her and me. 

Also, the same guy, that he and his friends showed up to my dead best friend's funeral uninvited to sit in the back, acting like they paid their respects. To come out years later, making a Soundcloud song mocking my dead best friend, saying that he should be dead. 

I continued in my psychosis that day at school, after I heard a booming voice in my mind that said, “This phone is going to ring in front of you in 10 seconds, I counted down 10 Mississippi, and the phone in front of me rang in class. I remember thinking I was a highly intuitive psychic time-traveler.

For some reason or another. I had the rationale of believing that the girl I met was endangered by these people after this incident that day in her classes, and I became concerned. I became so delusional that I left one of my classes to search for her in random classrooms. 

I landed on a teacher who told me in the past, a year after my friend's death. ""If I ever had an emergency, you can come to my classroom. I can take all the students out of the class. I can help you."" So this happened, and we called my parents. My parents were on the way from work to pick me up because I started to become concerned for my mental health. They were going to take me to the hospital. - 

During this encounter, the school police were involved and began questioning me when in the room after the call. I started to become paranoid, thinking I was under arrest and going to jail. I started to become delusional and verbally violent with the officer in disrespect without reason. 

The police officers, when I got up and tried to help move the backpacks of other kids in the classroom after the bell rang, into the hallway so they could get them. The police officer put himself in front of me, and the other police officer behind me. They were inches away from me, and I heard one say “Do you want to do it?” to the other, and the one in front of me said, “Yeah,” and I said, “Do what?” and for no reason the police officer tackled me to the ground, and wrestled me into the teachers desk, putting hand cuff’s on me. 

I screamed for my life, Bloody Mary, and every single surrounding classroom heard me. Students came to the door, trying to get in to save me. 

The school police started to interrogate me, confiscated my water bottle, Chapstick, and said, “We’re going to test these”, alluding to the recent death of Sam Motsay, who had recently overdosed on N-Bombe, which is a synthetic form of LSD. - I believe they asked me if I was on it. 

I got expelled from school for ""Fighting a police officer”, when County Police came to arrest me, and book plus process me. The lady school police officer said that I assaulted the police officer, and they were trying to push charges right there for Felony Assault, and it just ended up being resisting arrest, when never under any crime committed to arrest. Without Miranda rights. 

Only able to come back on a medical waiver from the hospital to school. 



\-



When I arrived at the hospital, my first grandiose delusion was the Shutter Island theme. I fought with the nurses on admittance and became hostile because I was delusional and thought they were lying to my parents to separate me from them. 

They held me down in an 8-point procedure and briefly held a plastic bag to prevent me from spitting on them. They injected Ativan into my IV, and my vision faded from colored vision to black, like turning off an old-school television. 



\-



Coming back to High School a week later, experienced the Wizard of Oz nightmare of the immaturity of teens in High Schools. like me, Dorothy of bullying, dealing with hazing, two-faced liars intentionally stigmatizing and creating mis-socializationally drama to misinform others about my false identity reputation. Marginalizing my life without chance or opportunity to show worthiness or growth. Stunting my whole lifeline, 

Also, the day of terror of sitting in front of all the people who had just experienced everything that happened the week before during class, like it didn't happen. 

Whipped cream on top was going to a soccer game the next weekend. To watch the girl who fell in love with me at first sight. Walking up to her while she was sitting alone in the stands, attempting to sit around near her to start a conversation about what happened, so I could explain it. She stood up and ran off without a word, right as I sat down and said, ""Hey,""

The cherry on top was during my psychosis. I had the delusion that one of my friends at the lunch table across from me during my episode was texting this girl, so I grabbed his phone out of his hand. He said, ""She's not in my contacts,"" I scrolled down his list, and found her in his phone book. I got her # out of it, and then started to text her over the next month. 

She started to reply, and I would text her every morning before school - like my dead best friend had taught me to do with girls. To wake them up with a smile every day, ... So I would text her ""Good morning"" and even do it normally without a reply. At one point after this, I asked her if she liked me, and she said, ""Yes."" 

Over time, after this. I don't remember what happened because she just randomly stopped replying out of the blue one day. I still haven't talked to her in person, a whole conversation. Just a simple, Hello, Goodbye. 

\-



After graduating from High School in 2015, we followed each other on Instagram for 2 years. I got the Follwers+ app, and it showed my insights, her being my #1 liked on all photos. 

I had not yet said anything about my Hospitalization up to this point, and kept my experiences to myself with my trauma. Going to therapy and trying to resolve it. Unsuccessful, grieving the reality that would come if I became vulnerable to her when telling her the truth of my visit. 

I saw her from time to time when I would go out and get something to eat. One time, when she was working at a Hostess job, she waved at me, and I put my head down in my hat and walked past her through the door. 

I saw her at a friend of a friend’s, a foreign exchange student’s going-away party. I guarded her in basketball and made her laugh, bouncing goofily on a trampoline to show off for her and get her attention. 

I saw her at two graduation parties, and we played volleyball together on a team. 

We also had an exclusive night, where all my old High School friends played soccer 5-5, where she showed up. I picked her to be on my team in the lineup, me as captain. Also scored on her nutmeg, while the goalie ran around with my shirt over my head. Victorious, her guy friend we played soccer with that night was good friends with me and took her to prom, and told me, ""She was happy to see me that night.”

In this era of my life, I was delusional. Dropped out of College due to trauma and paranoia. 

To start selling marijuana by the pound, to escape my judgmental Hometown. I planned to run away to Europe and become homeless & nameless. Sleeping on Euro-Star trains nightly, traversing the country's borderlines, moving around enough to never be seen. My wish. 





\-

In 2016 moved on to a new girl, about a year after this. Meeting someone new online. She liked my photos on Instagram and was from my old High School. She followed me, and I DM'd her. We started to talk for a week,

Sympathizing with her Dad's Stage 3-Terminal Lung Cancer, we began to bond over her struggle, empowering her strength. 

My at-the-time best friend, from High School. Knew this girl, and when I told him I was talking to her, he looked at me like he had seen a ghost, and as the hair on my arms stood up in the deafening stare of silence. 

He said, ""I shouldn't be talking to her,"" and wouldn't explain why. I thought it was because she was a family friend, with their family. It didn't make sense to me at the time, a very big head-scratcher. 

Over the next few days, I was messaging her still, and she became less and less frequent in replies, reply text, emotions, and length. I thought she was depressed because of her Father. The last messages I remember sending her were ""You are strong.”

The next day, after waking up and realizing I was out of the blue, blocked. I received a random text message from an old High School classmate I used to sell weed to. He had made up some whole elaborate scheme, a lie of a story. Saying that to him, and this girl that I was talking to, for a whole week. ""Had a boyfriend, and I'm her boyfriend. You need to stop talking to her; she doesn't want you talking to her. Me bothering her, and creeping on her."" 

This conversation delineated and descended into madness. I rivaled him, knowing this wasn't the truth. Having zero photos on her Instagram of him, or even mentioning him once during the week she contacted me. He ended up telling me to ""Go hang yourself"", and I figured out it wasn't the truth. 

The last message I read from him was before putting my phone down and starting to call people for days to find out where he lived.

Even worse, after this. I decided to further my investigation of what was going on with my reputation, which I didn't know about, wasn't my idea of my own life, but others' disrespectful perception. 

I took to Instagram to air out the dirty laundry of the conversation between me and the guy who texted me. 

Losing 500 followers in 2 days. I messaged the girl's best friend. She was my older brother, ex-girlfriend’s younger sister. I thought I could trust her enough, having had conversations with her in the past. 

She told me that ""in 1-2 years, her best friend who blocked me would be coming out as a lesbian, and that she was unsure about her sexual emotions towards men, and me"".  - I believed it, and this was a 2-year-long lie. That I believed. 

\-

After this lie was told to me in 2017, I thought that we all were literally ""Best friends forever"" because she just told me her best friend's deepest, darkest secret that she'll be coming out within 1-2 years. 

This also led me into delusional thinking, and I thought that since these girls were friends with me, she was lesbian. I could move on to a new girl, or what I poorly decided to do looking back. I went back to the first girl, her being friends with these girls. I thought I had a second chance, her being a lesbian. 

This fooled me into delusional thinking that these people were my friends. Literally, 

I made a Twitter account. Because I thought I was popular again, and started following all of these people who lied to me because I wanted to speak on the topic over social media, so I could follow my friends and clear the air, to get my reputation back. 

I followed and messaged the first girl that I met in High School at the soccer game on Instagram - trying to rekindle our relationship. Thinking we were friends now, us all in on the know-how about the girl being a lesbian.

I started to Tweet, but this is when my first manic/depressive episode happened. Back when Twitter was 140 characters, I tweeted 500 tweets. Opening up about the Hospital, because I felt comfortable about my new ""friends"" accepting me, and I wanted my whole community to know about this story now. Us being friends and feeling wanted and belonging.

The girl from High School got a No-Contact, restraining order against me. 

She didn't even read a single one of the Tweets I sent, and just saw her name mentioned and filed it. Because now this was technically ""harassment and cyber-stalking"" 

\-

I still was fully under the delusional, misinformed perception that this other girl was fully a lesbian, and was coming out in College in 1-2 years. After he Father passed away, she had time to heal. Feel comfortable.  

I tried to express this story to my old friends over social media. That had now ghosted me, unfollowed me, and blocked my number. 

I didn't know what was going on; I was in the dark for 2 years. No one, not a single person. No old ""friend"" decided to tell me anything about it - likely such a well-hidden secret targeting character assassination that all these other people, my old friends, hung out with. Lied to them. To rid me, 

I sat on Social Media over Twitter for 2 whole years, with 0 followers, tweeting my life and heart out away trying to make up for the past and be forgiven. Through reconciliation, and went to church weekly for the whole time. Thinking that Jesus had ""Blessed Me"" - Waiting 2 years for this girl to never come out. To figure it was a lie. 

1 year of realization of this lie, and no friends later. I attempted a suicide mission to talk to the girl from High School at the soccer game. The address where it was put on the restraining order was to be away from. I wanted to die and prayed to.  

I got arrested after showing up at her College dormitory campus, among 40,000 people. Twice, two days in a row. Searching for her name on the dorm doors. I was going to knock on her door, and wished she were inside to speak to her. It was my dying wish, almost looking back. 7 years ago this week, 

I went to Jail for 9 days, only. Thinking it would be more severe ""Stalking"" charges, which I literally Googled and researched before, because that's what I wanted to catch, to keep myself in jail long enough to be killed by an inmate. 

My parents could've bailed me out on day two, but hung up on me over the phone in a screaming match while staring at inmates who wanted to kill me over my charges. 

I went to the Hospital for two weeks after this and was misdiagnosed as bipolar. 

\-



I went to therapy monthly, which was mandatory for my plea deal while on probation back in 2017-18. With the same therapist for one whole year. Talking about this story, and about how she was a ""Lesbian,” and I hung out with one friend in this entire timeline of my probation of two years. 

The night I hung out with my one friend from High School, an old best friend, it was for 1 hour. His girlfriend at the time went to College. I showed up at her College. He harassed me deceptively in front of my face, to hang out with me to ""Figure out what's going on in my life,” my guess, and poked around, making fun of my life, all while calling me a friend. 

At one point, making up a game and scenario, where we would ""Imagine our future lives,” He started to get sinister, and said that ""I could see you being physically abusive towards your future wife, and just lightly slapping her around""... it got dark for no reason in particular. I didn't even say what I thought his life would be, or look like. I didn't get it, and couldn't believe he went all that way just to make it like that. In awe to this date, appalled, 

He got cancer 2 years later, and didn't let me visit him once while it was happening, 

My other best friend, the one who looked like he saw a ghost,  when I was talking to the new girl. I hung out with him one night after this incident, when I got diagnosed. I talked to him, and we bro'd it out. Apologized and agreed to disagree on the topic. He had changed drastically, and he and his girlfriend I knew from High School. 

They weren't even going to tell me they were planning on getting married together soon. I found out later on Instagram, not hearing about it when we hung out together, and he didn't even tell me it was going to happen. Most likely didn't want me asking to come, or be invited, or even think of such ideas. 

I had received a \*67 Caller ID prank call, with a girl disguising her voice as a man. I heard snickering and laughter from boys and girls in the background. They had asked me, ""Did you get laid by that one girl at the cul-de-sac party?"", putting the idea together later in time, ""The Block Party""   .... Up to this point in my life, I haven't talked to a girl in 5 years. 

I started to make over-the-phone death threats, and then, over the internet on Social Media on Twitter, I had a mental breakdown where I name-called and put death threats on my social media to people I thought had my number and were messing with me. 

The police were called, and I got in trouble with them for filing a report! They interrogated me in front of my parents, and I told them what was going on with me. They believed me, but told me not to go about doing it that way, ... I was just triggered and exploded in rage. 

I kept up the Twitter, unknowing of the idea that she wasn't lesbian, or not being real. Trying to communicate with the first girl with the restraining order, to reconcile and forgive. Attempting to persuade her to love me again, and negotiate out a deal between us to have happiness because it wasn't me, but my mental illness. 

Speaking to no one about it, and thinking that I shouldn't come out with her lesbian secret because he Father passed away from Lung Cancer now. I didn't aim to disrespect. 

I met an old High School friend, who I used to sell weed to at a gas station one night, ironically enough. His girlfriend at the time, who was with him, was best friends with the girl who had the restraining order on me. He actually came up to me in line, behind me, and stuck out his hand to shake hands, and say ""What's up"", like nothing happened. 

I messaged him on Snapchat, and he filled me in on a major truthful update. He said that the girl I thought was a lesbian wasn't. The girl with the restraining order was getting a second one, and she was also ""Happier without me.” Now apparently in a relationship. 

Coming shortly after, across a couple of months later, on her newly created Facebook page. She was dating the guy who was the host of the party back in High School, best friends with one of the guys who tried to take advantage of her in High School. 

The guy whose girlfriend in High School Freshman year cheated on him with me because she hated him. The guy who got his car door kicked in by my best friend, and my now-dead best friend. The guy who he and his friends made the song on Soundcloud, making fun of my dead best friend, and showed up to his funeral uninvited to pay fake respect to my dead best friend’s open casket. 

I had also found out that the girl I liked joined a sorority. 

She had also stated that I was ""Visionless, and controlling"", I needed ""to be happy, to be in a relationship""

\- 

I became suicidal again in 2019, but was hospitalized after writing a suicide note and put on medicine shortly after dropping out of college for the third time due to being symptomatic from stress.

I went to therapy for years after this, and after being discharged by my last therapist for ""inability to treat client, needs a higher level of treatment,” I bounced around from therapist to therapist. 

One time being called a stalker, and then by another an ""Incel"" 

My parents started to fight so much over the last years, with this idea and with me. Talking of divorce, and fighting, screaming at each other in death matches with me. My own Mother stated to me out loud once in a fight over this topic, where she chose their side for years against me. ""I don't know who you are anymore!""

Getting in a fistfight with my Father, where I knocked him out unconscious when he told me, ""I'm glad I kept you in jail for longer and didn't bail you out.”

My brother abandoned me. Not talking to me for whole years. Disliking me, If we already didn't get along before, a verbal fight with him one night brought out the idea, and words that I was a ""Fuck up"" 

\-

In 2020, I had another hospitalization, this one being my fourth and fifth. 

I was diagnosed with Schizoaffective-Bipolar. Originally, just diagnosed with bipolar, but it was a misdiagnosis. Unmedicated improperly for 4 whole years. In and out of psychosis, delusions, and hallucinations. Etc,. 

I had contacted the friend who met me at the gas station, who I used to sell weed to back in High School. He said that he could talk to her, the girl with the restraining order on me about it, and we talked back and forth for about a week. 

He said that she said that ""It had been so long since we met, and everything, including us, has changed. We weren't the same anymore, and we didn't have the same alignment that we used to have growing up”.

That sunk me like a rock to the bottom, and I was told that she was moving states, 8 hours away.

The guy also told me that she “Didn’t think I was stalking her.” 

4 years had passed on the restraining orders, and restraining orders only last 2 years.

Months later, I kept tallies of her on Instagram over the years. Dreaming of being unblocked and happy together once again. I kept tallies on her friends ‘ Instagrams, too, to check to see if she's in the photos, or if they leave me little coded messages like they used to back in the restraining order days, to communicate how they felt towards me with what I was saying.  

I found one day on her best friend’s Instagram, saying ""You're not alone"", ""I set you free for freedom’s sake :)!, Never give up, there are always brighter days around the corner."" 

I deleted my Instagram in rage and realization of a reversal in loss of time. I took it more than personally. 

I was frustrated with life. 

\-

During the next two years, 2021, & 2022,

I took medicine, looked around for jobs. Couldn't find therapy. One friend at the time, and he then suddenly passed away on his birthday night, I took him to the bars to drink with a group of my old friends. 

He co-piloted me that night and wing-maned me because he knew about my story. 

I had met a girl with him. He let us be, and I got her number that night. Took him home and talked all about it, smoked a blunt before he went inside for the last time. Talked about music and how art needs to be relevant. 

He left his lighter in my car that night by accident, and in the morning, when I figured out he had passed away. I found his lighter that reads ""Going Nowhere Fast""

He smoked about two packs a day and worked 80+ weeks. He passed away from a widowmaker heart attack. Age 25. Apparently had an undiagnosed murmur. The military never spotted it in his service. 

I worked around at my Dad's janitors' office for $3,600 a year. Couldn't get any jobs anywhere, not even at Walmart, with my misdemeanor ""Invasion of privacy"" charges. I wouldn't even get calls back after two interviews, and companies would flat-out ignore me like I was obsolete.  

I worked terrible, under-the-table jobs where I would make cash and often be manipulated out of money.

Quitting wear house jobs on the spot multiple times because I was unable to keep up with physical demands due to my symptoms. 

\-

2023, 

I was talking to a doctoral-level psychologist, who was also a therapist. She was a trauma care specialist, and she also specialized in intellectual disability, to name a few. She is no longer my therapist. She had me sign up for an Autism Screening Test, which I never ended up taking. 

Before she dropped me as her patient, she said After jail & the hospital, ""I was trying to have a relationship with her.” When I never said anything in any way to hit on her, or acted like I liked her. 

While I was in the hospital, trying to call her to get me out, being in there for a month, leaving her voicemails on updates on what was going on in my situation, 

The head Doctor came out and discharged me from the hospital. Saying that she had been talking to my therapist the whole time, and that I needed to see a new one.

?

In 2019, when I went to the psych ward after a voluntary commitment for suicidal ideation, I got evaluated for a week for Autism. 

The same dual doctorate resident who told me that she thought I was on the spectrum sat me down, and told me she wanted to take me out of the ward after the week's evaluation and take me to ""meet the other people just like me, to get to know myself better"". I told her ""No, I don't want to go"" because I had been there for 3 weeks, and it was a day before my birthday that I got discharged. 

I had an unmedicated delusion. I stopped taking medicine from when I started in 2021 to 2023 after my diagnosis.

I bought that same first girl that forgave me, and had the restraining orders on me, a Tiffany Charm Clasp Bracelet for $1,500 off my parents’ credit card, because I thought they were satanists, and wanted to make it up to her, and piss them off for messing up my life, abusing me emotionally.  

I got into a delusional fight about thinking my parents were living a double life as Free Masonic demonic worshipers. Which wasn't even close to the truth, just found an old Free Mason book on our bookshelf from 2000, where my Dad attended an introductory meeting with his friend when he was trying to sell him insurance. 

  
I told my Father priest about this on the day of the Feast of Guardian Angels, and while my parents were out of town on vacation when I went into madness.

My priest gave me a holy water bottle blessed to smite Satan. With the book wrapped in a towel after touching it, reading 5 pages, then slamming it shut. An Angel appeared and took the book in the image. Because I vacated my house, thinking it was cursed terrified. He told me to douse the house with holy water to sleep & shower, plus eat.

I got detained by my local police for disturbing the peace when getting into an argument with my parents. My Dad called the cops on me. At my house, after they got home.

I was taken to the local hospital by a police officer who heard out my story & gave me $100.

I took an Uber with the money he gave me after I got dropped off at the ER. Waiting for Secure Holding. The wait was 6 hours.

I went to my therapist's office in crisis and instead decided to go to the ER up there for me to try and get sleep medication because I hadn't rested in a week.

The medical staff at the hospital said they couldn't help me or prescribe me any medicine. They instead diagnosed me with Anxiety Disorder and then discharged me from the ER at 4 am in 25 minutes. When it was 20 degrees outside, I told them I had nowhere to go; homeless. Other people were sleeping on the chairs in covers. (probably homeless too)

The Resource Security Officer started to threaten me. I started to argue with him, and I walked out.

For some reason, my delusions and hallucinations took hold of me spiritually. I was enraged by my self-evident situational outcome.

I filled up the Holy Water vial with water and marched up into the ER. Threw the water on the officer's face who kicked me out, and ran out. Getting away. Dropping my phone in the process,

I walked about a mile on the premises, into a building where I thought I was secure to catch my breath from running.

The police stormed in and arrested me, saying, ""Hands on Officer, Officer down"". Portraying that I assaulted the man physically with my body.

When I saw the Officer again, he had red all over his face. I don't know what caused that. Maybe an analgesic reaction

They took me to the County Jail, where I was put into Cell Block C, with accused charges to be arraigned for Felony Battery

I was met quickly by inmates checking me. I was punked being my size and weight. Being in jail before, I knew this wouldn't be an easy trip.

Entering at exactly 7:07 am, the Officer checked when held for 20 minutes at the gates, with my confirmation Saint Maximillion statue in my possession in my book bag that they detained me with.

I was getting out alive, determined.

Not understanding that the complex only allowed one five-minute call per inmate each week without pay. Having no money in my account, I called my parents to let them know, before being cut off unknowingly mid-conversation. 

A despot inmate, after I sneezed once from likely dust being in the facility, accused me of having Covid, and started a fight that began with him charging at me to pull me off the 6-foot top double bunk I was lying in.

I jumped off, scared of the drop. Him all in my personal space and area. Tried to chase him out of my bunk, but I was knocked out. I sprang back up after hitting the back of my head on a metal bench seat.

An inmate behind me picked me up and led me back to my bed. Where I passed out for hours. 

Awoke in the middle of chaos, to have to defend myself from the guards never noticed on the camera.

The place was wild, with people smoking weed & spice in the showers. Passing lines of Coke through the neighboring cell block doors.

People coming in, and multiple jumping were being witnessed. Where these killers left other inmates bathed in blood and tears from head to toe.

I hid amongst the Fear of God with the other prayer group of inmates reading a Bible study in the block. With rife Hell Raising gang members telling me now, ""Don't press charges against him"", thinking this was the only way out of the block.

Being told, ""I was lucky because they stomped someone to death in this cell block here two weeks ago.”

Now knowing from other inmates, if I went into the medical or the suicide room. I could save myself.

Talking to one of the guards in the morning to check back on the cameras, honestly trying to get out alive with my life.

Going to the medical to be evaluated for my wounds after being forced by a gang leader to leave the block or else, after realizing staying in the block wasn't my best bet.

They transferred me and put me into cold isolation, giving me food with no utensils. No toilet paper for half the day.

Officers came to my cell after my claims in medical. Stated that I charged after him, and the person trying to hurt me wasn't trying to hurt me, ""On their million-dollar camera system"", now me being the assailant when I never touched anyone. Knocked unconscious, apparently, ""I was never knocked out"", since I got up so quickly.

Then they tried to mitigate the situation by trying to force me to sign papers saying that I wasn't going to press charges on him when I was now being arraigned on more charges, going to trial now for two cases. In jail.

In the meantime, while waiting, arraigned by the magistrate. I got my other charges lowered to A & B misdemeanors with a $500 bond.

Being moved to another block after medical & isolation, waiting until further notice. Realizing I was now transferred to the Sex Offenders’ block, behind two locked steel doors.

I was unable to call my parents, and now I also do not know my account login & password. The inmates in the other cellblock stole my paperwork, hacked my account, and took the other $40 in my possession that the first officer gave me out of my wallet into their commissary for coffee.

I was unable to manage to get an officer to help me for days, and was obviously ignored intentionally. Buzzing on the intercom for hours throughout the day to help me log in to my account to make one final call.

I was only told over the intercom that I was being moved back into the same cell block that I started in.

I lucked out, and they had to sanitize the whole block head to toe because somebody complained about lice being found in their bunk. Shaving our heads off, and making us shower naked in front of them to make sure no spread.

I managed to convince an inmate to give me a free 5-minute call, off his account. After two days. Telling me ""Never give up,"" after ringing me up a call.

My parents picked up, and I tried to calmly explain my situation. It ended with them telling me, ""We'll be there to pick you up in the morning, we're going to bed."" Hung up on.

I hadn't slept in 4 days straight, on top of the week in psychosis before. I wasn't eating food, only water fasting with Kool-Aid sugar packet water because the food was inedible.

In the morning, before breakfast is served. I got my call to be arraigned on my second-coming charges, and then I was supposed to be moved back.

Walking in the hallway and into the elevators.

Passing another Officer, who had my RO (Release Out) paperwork. Noticed my face, and said ""Is this ""....., ....... ?"". The officer handling me was surprised feet away from the courtroom.

Walked me in, and asked the Judge if I was ""Free to go?"", and the Judge nodded.

""He's free to go.""

I also got my first charge dropped after two months out of jail, and I pleaded insanity.

\-

During my 3 1/2 week hospital visit, after jail. Where I fought verbally and emotionally with the Head Doctor this time, over my ""Autism misdiagnosis"" 

The Doctors gas-lit me and said that Free Masonry was Black Magik, and that I was having a delusion of grandeur. I knew this wasn’t the truth, and I talked to the hospital Chaplain, and she said that “I need to get out of here”. 

I made a ""friendship bracelet"" that said the girl’s name that I fell in love with back in High School, and the same one that got a restraining order against me. It was for a memory’s sake, because I was losing track of time 

Meeting a lady there for two weeks, and on her last two days before getting discharged. She told me that she was diagnosed with Pulmonary Lung Cancer, 

Another patient told me that he was going to kill himself, and I made friends with him. He had just been released from prison and moved here. He was depressed and shot himself in the mouth; the bullet ricocheted into his skull. Making him eyeless in one eye, and not killing him.  

During my inpatient stay, I was notified that my charges from 2017 were expunged.

1onk9oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1onk9oi/aio_my_25f_bf_24m_is_constantly_offended_by_tiny/,AIO: My (25F) bf (24M) is constantly offended by tiny things and it’s driving me crazy,"My bf and I have been together for going on 3 years and we just moved in together a few months ago. I’ve always known he was sensitive and easily upset by things but recently it’a been so frequent and it’s driving me crazy, and I don’t know if I’m just rude or insensitive or if he is overreacting? Here are some examples of things he has started fights over

1. His mom’s birthday is coming up and he hasn’t made plans for it yet. I have plans for Saturday night that weekend, so I asked him if they had decided on anything yet bc I could do Friday night or Saturday brunch or lunch, just let me know. I mistakenly said the phrase “yea I’m free anytime other than _, so let me know because I’m happy to go if you guys want me there” this completely set him off. He said the phrase “if you want me there” wasn’t okay and that it made him feel like I didn’t like his family or that I don’t care about his mom’s bday? It turned into a whole fight and ruined our night. I felt like I was being normal but to him it was highly offensive. 
2. Another time recently, we were going to a new coffee shop and the parking was metered so we had to pay. He started getting super upset and said it was f’ing stupid and ridiculous we had to pay $2 to park. I said it’s okay I’ll pay for it, as I was putting my card in the meter he was still ranting about how dumb it is and I said “hey it’s okay I’ll pay I don’t mind, I’m excited to try this place so it’s all good, I just want to have a good morning” which again completely set him off. He said me saying “I want to have a good morning” was not okay and that he can’t voice his opinions without me shutting him down and that if he wants to be angry at the parking I should let him, and stop speaking to him so poorly. 
3. He was talking about his friend who recently called off an engagement and was saying his friend is stupid for doing that. He was going on and on about how it was a mistake and this guy is being an idiot. I mistakenly agreed with him, which I guess I shouldn’t have? But I said “yea it sounds like he’s being dumb” and he started back peddling and said “well that’s my friend so” and got mad at me for speaking poorly about his friend. 

I think I just feel like I’m walking on egg shells and I’m starting to feel like I need to keep track of a list of phrases I can’t say to avoid offending him. Except the list is never ending and no matter what he’ll find something new. I initially went from feeling guilty to now being so frustrated every time this happens. I would previously just apologize for upsetting him, but I’ve started to defend myself more and the fights are getting worse or last for such a long time now. Am I overreacting?

Tried reverse osmosis and while the water tastes better it still has an odd odor. This was the reason we switched exclusively to Costco( kirkland) water 6-7 years ago when the case was $2.49, $299 and now $4.99. We always have in house 12-14 cases and use it for anything from cooking to drinking and coffee, even our pets are drinking exclusively Costco water . We are a household where we purchased last bottle of fizzy sugary drink more than 10 years ago. A regular dentist check up showed slowly developing enamel damaged areas on a couple of family members teeth.  While genes and personal hygiene plays a huge role we eliminated diet (almost zero sweets). Dentist tried to figure out why our Xrays look worse and worse on a quite healthy diet and normal hygiene. He got down to what water we drink. When we mentioned Costco bottled water he asked us to buy PH strips and test it. He did say 7 is optimal, and anything bellow 6.5 could be the culprit. National EPA guidelines says ""**Acidic water (pH below 6.5):** Can be corrosive and may leach metals from pipe"". Ohh well I got home and use the pool strips. Costco water in  had a level of 6.3 PH. Ran to HD and got a different brand of strips to test . Again PH level was bellow what is deemed as acidic enough to ""leach metal from pipes"".

I know some of you might find my story trivial . To be honest I did worry about micro-plastics even if Costco says their bottles are BPA free but never though that PH might be acidic enough that could hurt someone.

we do go through a case in about 2 days

If you have a different take or have the option to test your Costco water with PH food testers please do. I'm curious what values others are getting

If you live with [Atrial Fibrillation](https://blog.fourthfrontier.com/?s=atrial+fibrillation+&utm_source=Reddit&utm_medium=ff&utm_campaign=blog) **(AFib)**, you already know how unpredictable it can be. One day you’re fine, the next you feel that familiar racing or skipping in your chest. What many don’t realize is that alcohol, caffeine, stress, and even poor sleep can be silent AFib triggers.

https://preview.redd.it/tasuud5x63zf1.jpg?width=2880&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cac5ad50738ee70a80a214555d497acdfa77f5fc

Alcohol, for instance, is one of the most common culprits - even one or two drinks can disrupt the heart’s electrical balance and spark an episode. On the other hand, caffeine’s role isn’t always clear. Some people can drink coffee with no issue, while others feel their heart flip after a single cup. Stress hormones and sleepless nights only add fuel to the fire, making your rhythm even more unpredictable.

Here’s the thing: your triggers are personal. What affects one person might not affect another. That’s why tracking your rhythm over time, during workouts, meals, sleep, or stressful days, is key to uncovering *your* unique pattern.

I don’t like the beach, never have. Never had a real reason either; just didn’t feel the same rejuvenation everyone else felt when they bathed in the sun and sand. I may’ve never had a concrete answer for my disdain of the bayside, but after this past week, quite the excuse has cemented itself.

I met Olivia in a coffee-stained book store early last year. I asked her what her favorite horror or sci-if novels were after she complimented my Twilight Zone shirt.
She admitted she wasn’t the biggest fan of the aforementioned genres but loved the show. We got lunch and let our cups of coffee do the talking for a little while. I don’t even like coffee, but while she poured her heart out, I drained my cup.

For lack of better description, she was awesome. She said her mother had a huge luscious garden when she was young, which gave her a love of nature and inspiration to start a small garden of her own that she hopes to expand.
Time flew as she told me all about her job at a pet clinic, playing tennis when she was in high school, that her favorite color was anything yellow or blue, and other random tidbits of her life.
She told me she loved peanut butter, and not in a normal way either. She’d put it on anything. I figured everyone’s got their thing. Some people are obsessed with hot sauce or pickles. Hers was peanut butter.

After an hour or so, while she was tossing out Led Zeppelin facts (I’d asked her favorite band), she threw a quick glance at her watch, then pitched herself from her seat. She was late for work and hurriedly punched her number into my contacts before leaving the table.
She paused after a step and asked if I actually planned on calling her, and I assured her I did. As she passed through the door, I noticed she was barefoot. Seems I’d stepped into a bear trap.

Even as I drove home, on the phone with my mother, Olivia sat still at the forefront of my thoughts.
She was a dainty little thing, stout with delicate limbs and quick, sprightly steps. She had a glossy dark coat of hair that crashed in waves along her collar bone, with warm curious eyes, bright and hazel. There was something sweetly compact about her; small but well put-together. 

It seems I had finally caught my tail in my mouth. Intent on not letting it slip, I chewed the night away, tasting something like anticipatory eternity until I spat her a text the next morning.
In the span of reading her reply, my blood both ran cold and caught fire. She was busy with chores all day, she said. But if I wanted, I could come by for a lunch break. Maybe stay a while after.

Heart thumping like an old speaker, I clumsily dropped her address into my GPS. I beat a frantic rhythm on my steering wheel and before I noticed, my tires were already humming a baseline I couldn’t keep in time with.
I wondered if I was a bad person while I stopped to get condoms, but whatever my apprehension might’ve sung was drowned out with belting anticipation.

Weaving reckless through old southern roads, the wildlife felt so comforting. Massive trees erected beautiful walls. Birds and vegetation, the interior design. Tire tracks stamped into the dirt floor while twigs and pinecones sat around like forgotten children’s toys.
At one turn of a hallway, I passed a faded roadside memorial, honoring a name I couldn’t make out. Weather torn teddy bears slept beneath bouquets of plastic flowers hugging a telephone pole.
Solemnity washed over me for a name I didn’t know and a story I knew just as well. With a newly heavy heart, I decided to lighten my foot the remainder of the drive.

A sun-kissed mobile home stepped out from behind the trees as I arrived. I checked the time. I hadn’t realized she lived quite out of the way; almost an hour outside of town.
I locked my door and knocked on hers. No answer. I knocked again. Still nothing. I didn’t want to be rude but the property didn’t look too big, so I decided I would take a peak around back and see if she was outside. Or maybe I should knock one more time before I snoop around. I rapped at the door again and listened for a response. Dead audience.

The silence didn’t even break with a creak in the steps as I left the porch and waded tall grass around the side of the home.
Fear swam up my throat in broad strokes as I felt the quiet watching me – except it wasn’t just the abstract quiet whose stare counted the hairs on the back of my neck.
I surveyed a wide treeline before finding a side window of the home, draped in a blanket of overgrowth. It wasn’t until I approached the window that I noticed the faint smell of something… damp in the air.
Pushing the aroma aside, I uncovered the glass to find curtains rest closed on the inside. Not wanting to be caught looking like a creep, I took a quick step away from the window and finished making the corner of the house.

Sure enough, she was crouched in the backyard, knees sunken into the Earth. She scooped soil with an odd rhythm. No shovel or gloves, just fingers raw at the edges, nails painted in mud.
I watched her for a moment, carving some shallow pit. Her head hung low, hair covering her face as she sung faint words through a whisper.
A small pile of torn grass and stones built up beside her, a lone peculiarly shaped stick the centerpiece of the altar.
Without warning, she sat up on the balls of her feet and sniffed her hands. And I mean really sniffed. Deep, deliberate, and choppy.
A gasp of some kind must’ve leaked from the corners of my mouth. She snapped her head towards me, not startled, but with an alert, wide-eyed glare – like I had been caught.

She stood up, dusting her hands on the back of her thighs, and met me halfway through the garden. 

“Hey, I was just finishing up something. You like it so far?” she asked, knees still caked in mud.

I swept the scraps of shrubbery, vegetation, and foliage under a quick pan of the backyard.

“Yeah, it’s pretty.” I caught a sent.

“Hey, is that rosemary?”

“It is! Cloves too. Grow it to smoke it.” She chuckled. 

“Come on! Let’s go inside. I’ve got some lunch thawing!”

The air thickened as I two-stepped into her home, each breath drawn a ballroom blitz between sweet and spoil. Candles warmly light cluttered shelves, spilling perfume into the room like ballerinas in perfect sync.
But beneath the dance of sandalwood and lavender, something sour lurked offstage, moving with its own rhythm, slow and dragging. I’d interrupted a tango where incense and rot struggled for the floor.

I lingered in the doorway, breathing in my surroundings, while Olivia hummed and rummaged through a kitchen cabinet. Her home was definitely lived in but not necessarily decorated.
Couch cushions, blankets, and pillows sat in small pallets around the living room, with soft dips in their centers. The hardwood floors wore a coat of dirt, save for scratches scarred near windows and doors. Two chairs stood stiff in odd corners with gnawed legs, pale wood akin to exposed bone.

“Do you have a dog?” I asked, inching inside.

“I do not.” She sat a half pound of ground beef on a plate, picked up a pack of buns and started towards me.

“Few stray cats who come around sometimes though.”

She opened the front door and motioned for me to follow. I drew my breath and took slow steps, marking every peculiarity I could.

“You like your burger any specific way?” She asked as fresh air purged my nostrils.

“No, no.” I smiled.

“However is fine.”

She molded a patty and threw it on the grill.

“D- do you have seasonings inside?” I stuttered, trying not to sound rude after telling her “whatever is fine”.

“Yeah!” She chirped.

“Cabinet next to the fridge. The one on the left.”

Trading the humid air for warm air, I crossed the doorway’s threshold and found the kitchen. I grabbed a few spice jars and creaked the left cupboard door closed.
Just as I had closed the cabinet, I heard a sound not of wood and steel, but of flesh; some faint squish and a buzz. Or maybe I thought I did and that was my justification for snooping.

Peeling open the right cupboard, a horrible stench crawled up my nostril, curling my lip. A mound of raw meat sat on a throne of mold, adorned in a crown of flies and maggots. I gagged and slammed the door shut, dropping a jar of paprika. Incredulously, it didn’t break. I snatched it back up and headed for the door, shoving the sight into my subconscious.

A second lump of meat dropped on the grill as I closed the front door behind me, handing Olivia the spices. She twitched her button nose, shaking the containers while I tried to contain how shaken I was.
Was this meat from the cabinet or did she have a fresh pound in the freezer? I didn’t see her open the fridge at any point.
Benefit of the doubt: I might’ve been too distracted by the decor, or lack thereof, to notice her open the freezer. Too caught up in thought, I hadn’t noticed Olivia extending a water bottle to me.

“Thanks.” I accepted.

She continued humming the same melody she’d been since I found her in the garden. I watched her in her lawn chair. She sat too still, with a straight back and hung neck, breathing heavy in quick intervals under low eyes.

“Do you like the beach?” She interrupted my staring.

“Oh uh, no, not really.” I stuttered.

“Never really have.”

“What?! How come?” She asked, playfully offended.

“You gonna be let down if I tell you I don’t really have a reason?” I tried to smooth my tone.

“I just don’t care for it. Plus there’s the heat and the sand. It's coarse and rough and irritating, and it gets everywhere.”

She giggled and turned over the patties.

“Well that’s gotta change! What’re you doing tomorrow?”

“Not going to the beach, I can tell you that much.” I chuckled.

“You’re lame as Hell!” She teased.

“Would you rather go at night?”

I sighed. “I’ll think about it.”

She rolled her eyes and slid a patty off the grill and onto a plate.

“What about tonight? Hang over til it gets dark and I’ll drive you down to Saltmere.”

That patty hadn’t been on the grill very long – or maybe more time passed during our small talk than I thought. No. No benefit of the doubt here. That patty looked almost raw still.
Yet, she stuck it between two buns with no toppings and took a bite. Too occupied with disgust, I hadn’t realized she was still talking.

“You good?” She asked.

“You kinda zoned out, it looks like.”

I snapped back.

“Yeah, yeah, sorry, I did.” I leaned against the railing.

“Is it good?” I interrogated.

“You still haven’t answered my question!” She whined.

“I know this great little area that’s not like a big section of the beach – and it’ll be night! So it won’t be too hot or crowded or anything.”

In all honesty, I was really struggling to form any response beyond “what the fuck are you eating?”, or something along those lines. I swallowed a lump in my throat, praying I wouldn’t have to do the same with the burger.

“Sure, sounds fun.” I reluctantly agreed.

She scooped the second hunk of meat off the grill as she celebrated her win. Handing me the plate, she apologized for forgetting the condiments inside, but offered me full reign to dig through the fridge for whatever looked good.
An offer I took to heart, twisting her sentiment. For a second time, I held my breath and ventured inside.

Attempting swiftness, I opened the fridge door, then freezer compartment. Not a single sign of ground beef. Maybe she pulled out the last of it? Maybe I should cope harder.
I closed the fridge and looked around. The kitchen table was cluttered with loose shirts, underwear, shorts, and other clothing. I peaked out the smokey window over the sink. Olivia chewed up a big bite of her burger and shook her head.

Making the decision unfortunately easily, I quietly raced through the kitchen and into her bedroom. There was a bathroom connected that I’d use as my excuse if I got caught.

Stepping into her room, the atmosphere shifted. Sour spoil swapped spots with musk and heavy saliva. My eyes darted side to side, pinning an open dresser as a point of interest.
I quickly sifted through the drawer, finding nothing but plastic bags of stale and expired snacks, hair brushes with chewed handles, and photographs of herself young, each dated with cute names like “Beach trip ‘97” or “Liv’s 8th Birthday”; nothing very recent though.

I dropped to my knees and peaked under her bed. To my utter shock and… confusion, I found a secondary source for the stench of rot in her home. Several small stuffed animals sat in some kind of order or pattern.
Birds and squirrels mostly, but two cats and what I thought was a fox (but might’ve been another cat) laid in thick pools of filth.

I shot up and listened for a moment, in case Olivia was growing weary of my absence. With no alarms, I pushed my luck and made my way to the other side of her bed.
Passing her window, I noticed a collection of fat smudges at eye level, or a little lower. Not to sound up my ass, but Olivia hadn’t even made any “excuse the mess” kind of comment. She just seemed to live like this.

I knelt down and swung the drawer open. Before I could decide how to feel, I heard the front door open and bolted for the bathroom. I closed the door in a faux calmness and waited a few seconds before flushing the toilet and starting the sink water. I attempted and failed to collect myself.

“You good in there?” She questioned.

I could only imagine she was peering through the door the same way she had caught me in the garden. I could hear her sniffing low at the base of the door.

“Yeah…” I stammered unconvincingly.

“Just had to take a leak.“

She investigated a moment further before replying.

“Ok, well did you find what you needed in the fridge?”

Some forms of fear are impossible to describe. And as I stood by the sink, hearing a stranger wedge her nose between the door and the floor, I felt a new paralyzation wash over me – one unlike any terror I’d endured before.

I took deep breaths until I felt I could feign bravado and opened the door.

“No actually, I came in and straight to the bathroom.” I lied through a chuckle.

“I’m starving though, so let me check whatcha got!”

She was sitting on the edge of her bed with a grin. She tilted her head at me as I stepped toward the kitchen, her grin widening in a way that felt just a few degrees off.
Her legs bounced once, twice– then she sprang. In a blur of motion, she launched from the bed and crashed into me, not hard enough to hurt, but fast enough to knock the air from my lungs.
My heart dropped as hard as I did onto the floor. Her dirt caked hands were on my chest and she was too close to my face. I could feel her breath, hot and quick, panting. She didn’t blink.

“Jesus Christ, Olivia,” I gasped, grabbing a hold of her forearm. She was strong.

She tilted her head again, slower. Her eyes tracked mine intimately. She stared a little too long as I tried to move her off me. Then, without warning, she darted forward and gently kissed me.

But I think both sides are missing the point. It’s not about the coffee.

What really matters is your overall attitude toward spending. The coffee itself isn’t the issue. It’s what it represents.

Someone who buys expensive coffee every day probably has similar spending habits elsewhere: clothes, gadgets, cars, nights out. Each one on its own might seem small, but together, those choices add up fast.

1onjurx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1onjurx/cross_eyes_killer/,Cross eyes Killer," CHAPTER ONE — The Last Day of the Cross-Eye Killer


​There are mornings the world wakes quiet, not peaceful, but hushed, as if holding its breath. This morning was a bruise across the sky.
​Gray light, heavy and smeared, bled across the window of her foster mother’s car. Dew clung to the glass like frozen tears, refusing to fall. Mia Bennett sat rigid, her stomach twisting in the specific, sickening way she’d only ever felt once before—the night everything in her life shattered.
​Today, she would watch the man who murdered her parents die.
​The road ahead was a pale, empty ribbon dissolving into a fog that felt less like weather and more like judgment. Closure should have been a wave of relief; instead, each mile wound something cold and hard around her ribs, waiting to squeeze.
​“You doing okay, sweetheart?” Carol, her foster mom, asked gently, her voice breaking the thick silence.
​Mia nodded, but her nails dug crescent moons into her palms. “Yeah,” she lied, the word scraping her throat. “Just tired.”
​Carol had kind eyes—tired, but genuinely kind. She squeezed Mia’s hand once, a brief anchor. “You don’t have to be strong today. Not for me.”
​“If I fall apart now,” Mia whispered, staring straight ahead, “he wins.”
​They said his real name like it mattered: Daniel Mercer. But to the world—to the terrified parents who double-checked their locks, to the media, and to Mia—he was only The Cross-Eye Killer.
​And to Mia, he was the thing that stood beside her bed when she was eight. He wore a paper-white mask with a forced, childlike smile and two crude, black X-marks where his eyes should have been. That image wasn't a memory; it was a brand, permanent and hungry, burned into the lining of her nightmares.
​The prison rose from the fog like a promise abandoned by God. Steel, concrete, razor wire. A place where hope died years before the prisoners did. Carol shifted, uneasy, as they approached the gate.
​“It looks less like a prison and more like a mausoleum,” she murmured.
​Mia didn’t answer. She felt it before they even parked—a sudden prickling on her skin, a drop in her stomach, like the instant before a fall. Something wrong. Something waiting.
​A metallic sound echoed from deep within the structure—a faint, dying hum against steel. It faded fast, but it left a cold, oily trace behind. Mia rubbed her arms.
​“Just nerves,” she insisted, her voice hollow.
​But it didn't feel like nerves. It felt like a current. A warning.


​  CHAPTER TWO — The Last Word


​The walk through the facility felt like moving through pressurized water. Fluorescent lights buzzed overhead in a relentless, unnatural rhythm. The halls were sterile, but Mia could feel the residue of old fear trapped in the concrete.
​The viewing chamber was colder than the corridors, a room designed to contain and extinguish life. A thick pane of glass separated them from the final stage—the electric chair, gleaming metal straps waiting.
​Her friends were already seated. Lily, the stoner girl, normally full of careless energy, looked small and pale. Alex, her boyfriend, was quiet, his jaw set in a protective line. Next to him sat Jax, tapping his knee restlessly, and Cass, gentle sunshine in human form, whose eyes missed nothing. They had insisted on coming, refusing to let her face this alone.
​When the guards wheeled Daniel Mercer into the chamber, the air sucked out of the room. He wore no mask—prison had stripped him of that power years ago—but in Mia’s mind, the white face clicked into place. She saw him strapped in, head restrained, and instantly saw the pale smile, the X-eyes empty and hungry.
​He scanned the witnesses slowly, his gaze finally snapping onto Mia. His lips twitched. There was no terror in his eyes. Only recognition.
​A priest offered murmured prayers. The warden leaned in, asking for final words.
​Daniel’s voice slid out, smooth and venomous, hitting the glass like broken glass.
​“Death is not a prison. It’s a doorway. And I walk willingly. I would sell my soul to the Devil himself if it meant I could do it all again.”
​A shiver of genuine terror, far colder than the room, ran through Mia—before the switch was even thrown.
​Then came the flash.
​The man’s body jerked against the restraints, muscles seizing grotesquely. Sparks danced. The air filled with the sickening scent of hot copper and burning things. Mia didn't blink. She waited for him to disappear.
​But as his body slumped lifeless, a flicker moved behind his eyes—not physical, not earthly. A hateful, incandescent spark, like something stepping out instead of fading away.
​And in that instant, Mia knew: This was not over. This was the beginning.
  

CHAPTER THREE — The X-Mark


​The world outside the prison felt wrong, like a clock that had skipped a crucial beat. The sky was dull. The sunlight had lost its conviction. Mia tried to blame trauma, stress, the inevitable psychic debris of witnessing a state execution.
​The next morning was supposed to be a return to banality: school, lockers, coffee. Instead, Mia woke with the clinging darkness of the prison. Every time she blinked, the mask, white and smiling, with its twin X-eyes, was there, waiting for the game to restart.
​“Morning!” Lily burst through the bedroom window—a cheerful, slightly clumsy raccoon. “I brought breakfast.”
​It was cheap cereal bars and a borrowed lighter, but it worked. Mia laughed, tension cracking slightly.
​They sat on the roof, smoked, and shared comfortable silence. For a moment, she felt safe. Like maybe nightmares couldn't climb higher than the eaves.
​But school felt like a trap. The hallways were claustrophobic. Every reflection in the glass seemed to contain a shape that vanished when she turned. By third period, her breathing shook. She walked home, leaving the sterile halls behind, and collapsed onto her bed.
​She woke to the dream: the prison lights flickering, the smell of burnt wire. Through the shadow, the figure stood—the mask glowing.
​“Did you think a cage could hold me?” the voice whispered, though the smile on the mask never shifted. “The door opened. And I stepped through.”
​She gasped awake, sweat chilling her skin.
​BANG.
​A face at her window. She screamed—until the figure laughed.
​It was Lily. “Girl, your scream almost peeled my eyebrows off.”
​Mia shoved her playfully. “You’re evil.”
​“I’m prescribing you two hits,” Lily announced, producing a joint.
​They returned to the roof, sharing warmth and the smell of autumn. Mia leaned against her friend, feeling her heartbeat slow to a normal rhythm. She felt anchored.
 

CHAPTER FOUR — The Discovery 


​Morning sunlight was pale, weak. Lily was cross-legged on the floor, applying mascara with mismatched socks, humming off-key.
​“Seriously,” Lily paused, brush mid-air, “if reincarnation is real, I wanna come back rich and completely irresponsible. Like, someone who buys expensive dogs and then forgets their birthdays.”
​“You already forget everyone’s birthdays,” Mia said, pulling her hair into a messy ponytail.
​“Yeah, but imagine doing it in a penthouse.”
​Mia smiled. These were the moments that convinced her the world was still worth the fight. They grabbed backpacks and walked to school with shared earbuds and comfortable silence, Lily bumping her shoulder once, then twice.
​“Dude. You’re smiling. Like… voluntarily.”
​“Shut up.”
​“Just checking. Also, hey… I know yesterday sucked. I’m here. Always, okay?”
​Warmth swelled in Mia’s chest. “I know.”
​And she did. 

​The track smelled like autumn and damp earth. Lily stretched dramatically, complaining.
​“My body wasn’t built for athleticism,” she whined. “It was built for napping and snacks.”
​Mia laughed. “Try not to die out here,” she called, shouldering her books.
​“Psh. Me? I’m immortal.”
​Mid-warm-up, Lily landed wrong. Pain shot up her ankle. Coach waved her off. “Locker room. Ice it.”
​She limped across the field, annoyance replacing humor. The hallway inside was unnaturally cold. The fluorescent lights hummed. Lily paused, her breath hissing between her teeth.
​“…Hello?” Her voice was swallowed by the emptiness.
​She pushed into the girls’ locker room. Metal lockers. Chlorine. The sound of a dripping shower. She grabbed the ice pack, placing it carefully on her ankle.
​And then—the sound of air being displaced. A whisper of movement.
​She froze.
​“Coach? Mia?”
​Silence.
​Then, a shimmer in the mirrored locker doors. At first, a shadow. Then, sharp.
​A figure.
​The white mask. The childish smile. The two crude, black X’s for eyes.
​Her body turned slowly, her mind struggling to process what her eyes already knew. He stood behind her. The mask tilted, waiting.
​“No,” Lily whispered, her voice a thin thread. “You’re dead. You’re—”
​The blade flashed.
​She stumbled back, screaming. A hot, tearing line split her arm. She kicked wildly, connecting with something hard, sending the figure stumbling. She ran—limping, scrambling—
​He grabbed a metal equipment rack and slammed it down across her legs.
​Metal crashed. Lily screamed as pain tore up her side and ribs. The sound bounced off the tiles—hollow, hopeless.
​She clawed for air. He stepped closer, the knife gleaming, reflecting the buzzing lights overhead.
​“No—please—” she sobbed, voice raw. “Mia—”
​Steel fell. Again. Again.
​Wet impacts mingled with the grunts of effort. Lily tried to crawl, her fingers leaving streaks on the tile like fragile red brushstrokes.
​The mask leaned down. The X-eyes stared, a sick joke carved into innocence.
​And then, everything went still.

​Mia left class when the phones started flashing and the whispers turned to shrieks. Fear spread like wildfire, funneling everyone toward the auditorium.
​A physical knot formed in her chest. No.
​“What’s happening?” she grabbed a passing student.
​“Someone’s hurt. They said… someone from the track team.”
​The world muted.
​She shoved through the crowd, her feet moving on their own. She burst into the auditorium, then stopped, her breath catching like a snagged hook.
​The stage.
​Bodies were backing away, their faces bleached with a horror that transcended shock.
​Lily.
​She was displayed on the stage, clothes torn, blood dark against the wood. She had been arranged, posed with ritual precision. And over her closed eyes, drawn in thick, unmissable crimson—
​Two X’s.
​Mia’s scream ripped from somewhere ancient—a noise of disbelief and primal grief.
​Her vision swayed. The stage lights flickered.
​And in that impossible, terrible blink, she saw that mask!",2,1762194778.0,creepypasta,1,1.0,False

I’m writing a short paper about fanfiction and creative transformation, and I’d love to include a few safe-for-work examples of different types of fics.

I’m looking for stories that fit into these three general categories:

* canonverse: stays in the original world (missing scenes, prequels, post-canon, etc.)
* canon divergence: starts in canon but splits off at some point (“what if \_\_\_ survived?”)
* alternate universe (AU)**:** moves characters into a totally new setting or genre (like a modern AU or coffee shop AU)

I’m mainly hoping for examples from bigger fandoms like Harry Potter, Star Wars, Marvel, or The Hunger Games, but anything recognizable works.

If you have any favorite SFW fics that fit one of these, could you drop a link or short description? I’ll just be referencing them as examples of structure, not quoting or reposting anything.

I work at a new bar in my city that opened only two weeks ago as a waitress, and rhere's this guy who works as a cook that i like. I started just thinking he's hamdsome (cause he is, green eyes, chestnut hair....), but last week i had an 8 hour long shift just him amd I and we started chattimg a lot. He asked me a lot of things about me, my studies, how i view some things like for example opposites attract relationships.... and we talked a lot and found out we have similar views in a lot of stuff.
Well, the next day i had a shift with him, my work bestie and a new girl that ignored all that i told and explained to her, and i ended up getting so stressed that i had to go to the bathroom and cry. I made sure to clean well my face and avoid any trace to be noticeable (and it also helped that at our bar our lightning is quite low), but with just one glance he noticed, asked me if i was okay and trued to cheer me up with little jokes and motivating me.

Well, the following days i only saw him during the shift change, we dkdnt work together that days, and at first he wouldnt talk to me (me neither cause with other people close i get shy and nervous, scared that they may notice i like him), but a little later he would come to me, ask me how im doing, ask me to make him a coffee (according to him, im the one that makes them the best and i always remember what he likes with them), and yesterday we finally had another shift together. When he came to the bar, he spent the first hour and a half quiet, only talking to my work bestie.... so i started to overthink again about it, but after an hour or so he started treating me as usuall, joking, asking me things.... even at one point when i went to ask him something a customer had asked me he noticed i was trembling, which i didnt realize till he pointed ot out, and asked me why i was trembling (not going to lie, im not sure if it was due to nerves or to the laugh attack i had just had due to two customers), and we finished the shift him, my work bestie and me laughing till tears

And this is all till now. Im not going to lie, im an overthinker, since i was little, so this ""now we're great, now i start quiet, now i go to you"" stuff really messes me up. I sometimes feel like he may be interested in me too, but then i think he may not be.... and i dont know
What do you guys think?🥺🥺

Pd: I forgot to mention, we have a few little inside jokes, like the age one, cause when he asked me i told him but when i asked him he made me guess and i was the only one he straight away told was right, and now we have this little joke between us when another coworker asks him about his age",2,1762194267.0,Crush,0,1.0,False

I wanted plants above my cabinets in my ""refreshed"" kitchen.

Kitchen window is west facing. Some plants on that west wall, some north wall, some east wall. But I think I would consider them all low, indirect light. So I got plants that Lowe's said were good for medium or low light. 

Most of them are the waterwick things

I also installed a cheap LED grow light so that I could adjust how much light they get. I understand these aren't miracle workers but I figured it would work as ""supplemental"" lighting if needed. There are 10 brightness settings, pictured is only like a 3-4 out of 10.

The plants did OK for like 6 weeks with no LED usage, starting to show some browning but maybe missed a watering or two as well. So now I am thinking I should get on an LED schedule, and looking for general advice on that. I can also group the plants differently if they really need different light demands. I know you can also burn plants out, and these LEDs are fairly close to the plants, just not sure how serious of a risk this is.

I am sure I could probably provide better info, I am very ""green"" aka dumb when it comes to plants so please ask away.

Many thanks! I love the aesthetic in my kitchen (and in other rooms), I just always kill stuff and dont want to spend 60 bucks every couple of months on new plants. And I dont want to give in to fake plants.....yet.
