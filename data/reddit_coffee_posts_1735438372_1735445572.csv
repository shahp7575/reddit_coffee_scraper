Pls i need some advice. I picked up a rider and his female companion at aroud 8:15am Saturday morn 28th Dec 2024, somewhere in Agricola, Halifax, NS. Canada. It was a 3 mins trip to the nearby dollar store situated on corner Kempt rd/ Young st. I should mention here that I HAVE A DASH CAM that Uber must clearly have warned all intending riders about before they get in my vehicle. As we get to the traffic light just before the dollar store destination, the male rider sitting behind me pulls out $15 and rudely tells me to drop him off at the designated dollar store and after that, I should then go and get him coffee at the nearest Tim Hortons. I am shocked at the disrespect as i havent told him i was going to be doing his errands. With all the politeness i could muster, i tell this entitled individual that I would only be rightfully dropping him off at the destination stated on the app. He then raises the $15 amount he offerred to $20 and i once again decline and then tell him that its not about the money. 10 secs later i drop them off and wish both of them a nice day.  To my greatest dismay, he gives me a bad review sayin that i failed to carry out his request (imagine that). This obvioulsy got me pissed as this type of behavior had happened before where i have been disrespected by the rider and still got a bad review from said rider. On the first occassion which was also caught on my dash cam, involved 2 ladies and a guy. On our way to destination, the lady sitting by me in front ps seat says she wishes to change their trip destination to a CASINO, when i point out that i didnt see any casino on their route or destination, she tells me the Casino is in her P\*\*\*y. If I the driver had said that, i would be in cuffs. Now here is the part I want to sue Uber and/or the aforementioned rider for emotional distress at least. Uber wont allow me upload the footage as they keep timing out the upload link after a few mins. They(Uber) say they wont remove the negative review on my profile as they tell me it is no big deal, which is untrue. I have documented their message tellling me so.  Lastly at a minimum, they also wont ban this entitled rider to prevent the clown from repeat behavior on another driver who may not have a Dash cam.",1,1735445304.0,uber,0,1.0,False

It sucks so much, it turned my friend into a coffee cup. It sucks oh so much, made my brother go insane. I AM NOT JOKING. Here's this horrible pasta:

When I was sitting in my bedroom, with my friend Tickleson Tingle by my side, I saw on the tv, a new show called ""The Nick Show."" Teh Nick Show was super scary because three seconds in, (yes, I counted) Nick was on the screen!!!!!! I think this is just a graphics glitch though; it seems very unlikely that the character Nick I see with my own eyes is there even though he's the main character. Nick then said ""Hello, I am seven billion bees, and I am nick. AAAeaeaeuuuuuuaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAooooooooooooooooooooooooooppppppppppppppppppppppppppppplllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccccjjj""  
This quote scared Tickleson, as, he said ""What the hell was that? That doesn't have any nuance. Aren't creepypastas meant to scare? This sucks, man."" and then Tickleson stopped being alive! HE GOT SEWER SUIDEDED OH MY GOD this is meant for shock value.  
I shared my story on reddat and that's how yur seeing this now!

Thought the story ended? NO. sonic.exe came out of my tv and said ""All your base belong to us"" and max headroom from max headroom incident came to my house!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

1honlft,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating/comments/1honlft/am_i_being_soft_ghosted_32f/,Am I Being Soft Ghosted? [32F],"Hey, everyone. Buckle up, this is a long one. 

So just for context, I \[32F\] left an emotionally abusive marriage a little over a year ago. I've dated a bit during 2024, but only ever casually or in a short-term capacity because I knew that's what I could handle at the time. I am currently a PhD candidate by trade, and received a lot of romantic/sexual interest from some of my male colleagues when the word got out that I was single again. I turned them down, because I didn't want to get involved with someone I work with, and only wanted casual and uncomplicated dating app flings at the time. (Also, some of them were downright nasty and disrespectful. No thank you.) 

There was one guy in my department \[31M\] who displayed interest from the start, but in a reserved, respectful way. For example, when he first heard that I'd gotten divorced he said ""I'm sorry for the pain of that"" but didn't say what most people had said, which was just ""I'm sorry that happened to you."" Then two days later he went to a department party (he's not very outgoing so it was odd for him to actually attend), and afterwards rode six subway stops with me in the opposite direction from where he lived to make sure I made it home safely. (FYI I did not ask him to do this and said I'd be totally fine, but he kindly insisted.) He also often gravitated towards me at department events, either speaking to me intently or staring at me while he thought I wasn't paying attention. He always took the time to praise me for my work and the positive effect my presence brought to the department. Super sweet, a little blushy/reserved, but sort of playful in a way. He's a rather quiet guy who studies Shakespeare and Tolkien for his dissertation, so he's always had a creative, intellectual, and imaginative vibe. (He is also likely neurodivergent, as are many scholars, but I don't know for sure.)

A few months later, I added him on Facebook bc he was in my suggested friends and I do know him. He messaged me less than two minutes later to ask how I was doing, and we struck up an engaging conversation. He asked if I'd like to grab coffee sometime, and I said that I could as friends/colleagues, but only if he understood that I was not open to dating someone I work with, because it was too complicated for me at that point while I was still healing. He said he totally understood, as he had had a traumatic breakup three years prior and it had taken him a long time to heal from it. So we chatted online as friends from time to time, with him usually being the one to reach out. I knew he was interested in me, but had made my boundaries clear, and he respected them. 

Well, over time I started noticing that I was in fact catching feelings. Our conversations were becoming more frequent and often went long into the middle of the night, sometimes until the sun came up. I talked with my therapist about it, and she encouraged me to lean into those feelings if I felt ready. So I started to flirt back just a little bit to test the waters. One day (about eight months out from my divorce) we decided to meet up for a walk in the park. It wasn't officially a date, but the vibes were there. We both had a nice time, but didn't solidify anything at that point because it was right before we were both departing for summer travel, as many PhD students do. We kept in contact over the summer, but on a somewhat casual basis, since he was writing his field exams (which are very intense and took up about half the summer) and I was working multiple jobs and didn't have much free time. He did end up having to move apartments unexpectedly near the end of the summer, and chose an apartment just a few blocks away from mine. (This wasn't on purpose, it's just a nice neighbourhood. He didn't know my exact location at that point, just the general area.) 

Fast forward to mid-September, and there was a mandatory department meeting that we both attended. Let me preface this by saying that he had had an incredibly long, unkempt beard that covered his whole face up until this point. I already thought he was somewhat attractive, but had never really seen his face. But he walked into that meeting clean-shaven, and I about DIED. He was SO HANDSOME. OMG. (And also British, idk if I mentioned that. That always helps.) I had already had some emerging feelings for him before this, but this was the first time I felt real, all-consuming desire in addition to the emotional connection. It was like the emotional and the physical suddenly converged in the most sudden, intense way. (This isn't meant to be shallow... I legitimately didn't know what his face looked like before this. The beard was extreme. And I liked him already anyway.) 

So anyway, we kept making eyes at each other during the meeting, and it was obvious that something was about to go down. We took the subway home together after the meeting (since we now had the same stop), and walked all the way down to the south end of our neighbourhood, where we both live. We talked the whole way, and kept making crazy eye contact with each other. I had NEVER experienced sexual tension like that. So we part ways once we get close to my place, and maybe an hour later he sends me a message. We got to talking and things were getting flirtier by the second. We cut off the conversation at a certain point because it was obvious that things were going to get sexual, and we both wanted to think about that before proceeding, since we work in a small department and things could get complicated. (And also, we'd both been hurt really badly in the past.) But the very next night we started messaging again, and things got HOT. OMG. Like... romance novel hot. I eventually told him that I didn't know where this was going or if it would turn out well, but that I was very interested and invited him over to my place if he was interested. He definitely was, and so we made plans for the next weekend. (We also talked about if we should take things slow and go on a few dates first, but we both agreed that the sexual chemistry was distractingly strong, and that our many conversations over the past nine/ten months displayed that there was a strong emotional connection as well. I, for one, was about to go crazy if I didn't have that man over, and so I just went for it.)

So he came over the next week. He brought flowers, which I thought was really cute because most guys wouldn't bring flowers to a sex date. We were both a little nervous at first, and talked about how this was a big shift that would be hard to undo once started, but eventually got there and had ABSOLUTELY AMAZING SEX. Like... life-altering. OMG. He stayed for a while after, held me, gave me the sweetest compliments (""you've got the loveliest map of freckles"") and even sang me a lullaby. Then eventually he had to leave, and we kept in contact by messaging every day, and decided to meet up again a week later. Also amazing. Then he wanted to take me on a real date (cute), so we went to see a play together. Had a great time. 

Friends, this is where things started to get murky. Six weeks into dating, he got COVID and couldn't see me for two weeks (very safe and fair) but afterwards started being a little flakier with his plans and communication. It was totally possible that he was still recovering from the virus (he is immunocompromised) and also exhausted from his crazy teaching schedule, but the pattern started looking like one I'd experienced before: where a guy puts in considerable time and effort to win me over, and then fades out once he is successful. This is a hard boundary for me, as it's one of the things that really messes with my anxiety. So one night he had asked if he could come over after a long day of meetings, and I said of course. Then later he messaged me to let me know that he was too tired and couldn't come over. I responded by saying that it was TOTALLY fine if that was the real reason he couldn't make it, but that I'd been getting some mixed signals from him lately, and if the actual reason was just that he wasn't as interested anymore, he should just tell me so I could move on. He FaceTimed me IMMEDIATELY (which he'd never done before) to tell me that he was in fact VERY interested, but felt like a bit of a mess at the moment. He said that his previous breakup (three years ago) broke him and that he misses the man he used to be before his world imploded and he had to start from scratch to rebuild himself again. He also said that he was scared to open himself up to someone new because he was hurt so badly before, but that he also didn't want to ruin a potential good thing with me, someone ""utterly warm, charming, brilliant, and lovely"" that he said ""felt like a land and a home"" with whom he shared a ""music of the mind and imagination."" He said that his PhD work, which is at the centre of his life, is about joy piercing through grief, and then said, ""It's important that you know that I once understood joy, then become all-too-closely acquainted with grief, but the moments when I have most felt joy's quiet return are in the moments when I am up in the wee hours of the morning, talking with you. That is a rare gift, and I do not intend to waste it simply because I am tired and afraid."" (Yes, he actually said this. He has a tendency to speak poetically because he spends so many hours studying and performing Shakespeare.) And then he said we should make in-person plans more often so we can get to know each other better and see where things lead. 

The problem is, he is terrible at making plans, and has a tendency to resist committing/showing up when I try to make plans myself. Not every time, but often enough. I don't think this is unique to me---although he shows up to things he HAS to go to (like meetings and appointments, though I think it's an effort for him), he often struggles to manage his time when it comes to extracurricular things like parties, optional workshops and presentations, and, obviously, dates. (Again, I think he is neurodivergent and struggles with executive functioning.) It's been three months now, and we have only actually had three in-person dates/hangouts since that FaceTime conversation six weeks prior. He has FaceTimed me several more times, including staying up with me when I got sick and couldn't sleep so he could keep me company and recite sonnets to me until the sun came up. He has shown that he pays close attention to my likes and dislikes, my habits, and also my insecurities. When I got my hair done and was upset because I wasn't sure I liked it, he called me to tell me ""It does not look bad at all, and could not possibly look bad on your head. But I think you need to have a higher opinion of yourself. I want you to understand that something as fickle as hair could never impact the things that are most attractive about you. You are an enchantress inside and out, no matter what your hair looks like."" LIKE??!? 

And while we have continued to have sex most of the time when we meet in person (not always though), it's clear that the romantic/emotional side of things has gotten much deeper, and that this is not just a sexy fling for either of us. At the same time, he has resisted putting a label on things (though we both agreed to be exclusive early on). I think this is fair, since we are both healing from heartbreak and finding our footing, and since we both work in the same tiny department, it's wise to take things slow to avoid unnecessary drama. But what I take issue with is that he has stated his main reason for not wanted a bf/gf label yet is that he doesn't know me that well, since so much of our contact has been virtual and not in person. This is true, but the reason we haven't met in person as often is because he cancels plans so often. And he only lives like four blocks away from me. So that's frustrating. He also hasn't messaged me as much, and has left me on read from time to time as well, sometimes responding as much as two days later. I understand that it's the holidays and we are with our families, and that the end of the semester was insanely busy (for me too, and I was sick for most of December as well). But I can't help but notice that although there may be some decent reasons, his communication style and frequency is not like it was a few months back when things were newer. 

I know this is not a good sign, and that it's possible he is soft ghosting me and fading things out rather than having an honest conversation. That being said, he has told me many times in the past that he would tell me if he felt like he was losing interest, because I told him I would rather know than guess. (One of my anxiety triggers.) I do plan to speak with him about this in the new year when we're both back in the same city, but I am curious as to what people with outside perspectives might think. Obviously, I'm going to do what I think is right and appropriate, and am not planning to blindly taking relationship advice from internet strangers. But my last relationship was somewhat warped and left me a little anxious about relationships in general, so I think it would be helpful to get feedback even if I disagree with it. I am a verbal processor, so it can be helpful for me to work things out in conversation with others. I don't have too many people I can go to about this, so I figured I'd give you all a try. I really like him, but I am not willing to compromise my boundaries and sense of self-worth over any man, no matter how much I care for him. I can make hard choices if need be. 

Any thoughts? Do you think I'm being soft ghosted, or am I overthinking it? ",1,1735444857.0,dating,1,1.0,False

--------------------------------------------------------

Living in a tiny home can be both a challenge and an exciting adventure. With limited space, you might wonder how to make the most out of your surroundings. Fortunately, there are many creative ideas to enhance space efficiency and bring functionality to your tiny living area.

Start by opting for multi-functional furniture. This means choosing items that serve more than one purpose, which can drastically reduce the amount of furniture you need. Here are some outstanding options:

- **Sofa beds:** A comfortable sofa can transform into a bed at night, allowing you to have a cozy seating area during the day without sacrificing sleeping space.
- **Ottoman storage:** Use ottomans with hidden storage inside to keep your belongings organized. They can also double as extra seating or a coffee table.
- **Drop-leaf tables:** These tables can be expanded for dining and reduced when not in use, saving precious space.

Another way to maximize space in your tiny home is to use vertical storage solutions. Instead of spreading things out horizontally, think vertically. Shelves, hooks, and wall-mounted storage can help you keep your floor space clear. Here‚Äôs how:

Check Details Here: https://blogmoneyweb.com/tiny-home-ideas  
  
- **Floating shelves:** Install floating shelves to display books, plants, or decorative items without taking up valuable floor space.
- **Wall hooks:** Use hooks to hang items like coats, bags, or even kitchen utensils. This keeps them organized and easily accessible.
- **Over-the-door organizers:** Hang organizers on doors to store shoes, cleaning supplies, or pantry items effectively.

Don‚Äôt overlook under-utilized areas, such as under the stairs or bed. These spaces often serve as hidden gems for storage. Consider these creative tiny home ideas:

- **Under-stair storage:** Convert the space below your stairs into a closet, bookshelf, or even a miniature office. This makes good use of space that often goes ignored.
- **Bed risers:** Elevate your bed on risers to access storage bins underneath. This is perfect for seasonal items or off-season clothes.
- **Storage stairs:** If your tiny home has stairs, use them as storage by building drawers into each step.

Don‚Äôt forget the benefits of decluttering. In a tiny space, every item you own should serve a purpose. Here‚Äôs how to keep your tiny home organized:

- **Regularly evaluate your belongings:** Take time to sort through your items every few months. Determine what you truly need and what can be donated or discarded.
- **Adopt a minimalist mindset:** Focus on quality over quantity. Invest in items that are durable, versatile, and timeless.
- **Use clear containers:** Store items in clear storage bins so you can see what‚Äôs inside without having to dig through them.

Another excellent idea is to embrace natural light. Bright, airy spaces feel larger than they are. To achieve this in your tiny home:

- **Large windows:** Installing larger windows can flood your space with sunlight, creating an illusion of a bigger area.
- **Mirrors:** Place mirrors strategically to reflect light around the room and give a sense of depth.
- **Light colors:** Paint your walls in light colors to enhance the feeling of space and openness.

Consider also using outdoor spaces to expand your living area. If you have a small patio or balcony, create a seamless indoor-outdoor flow. Here's how you can do this:

- **Outdoor furniture:** Invest in weather-resistant furniture you can use to relax or entertain guests outside.
- **Planters:** Incorporate plants to add life and color and to create a calming atmosphere.
- **Fire pit or chiminea:** A small fire feature can create a cozy gathering space during cooler evenings.

By incorporating these creative tiny home ideas, you'll discover that maximizing space efficiency is not just about making room but also about enhancing your living experience. With a thoughtful approach, your tiny home can feel both spacious and functional, making everyday living a joy!

Sustainable design elements for tiny homes
------------------------------------------

Living in a tiny home is a fantastic way to minimize your environmental footprint while maximizing your quality of life. Sustainable design elements play a significant role in this lifestyle, making it not only eco-friendly but also comfortable. Here are some innovative sustainable design elements to consider when building or renovating your tiny home.

### Energy Efficiency

Energy efficiency is a cornerstone of sustainable design. By focusing on energy-efficient solutions, you can significantly reduce your home's energy consumption.

Check Details Here: https://blogmoneyweb.com/tiny-home-ideas  
  
- **Solar Panels:** Installing solar panels can help you harness renewable energy from the sun, reducing reliance on non-renewable sources. This addition can make your tiny home almost energy-independent.
- **LED Lighting:** Use LED lights throughout your home. They are not only energy-efficient but also last longer than traditional bulbs, reducing replacements and waste.
- **High-Quality Insulation:** Proper insulation keeps your tiny home warm in winter and cool in summer. Materials like spray foam or recycled denim can provide excellent insulation without harming the environment.

### Water Conservation

Water conservation is essential when it comes to sustainable tiny homes.

- **Rainwater Harvesting:** Install a rainwater collection system to gather and store rainwater. This water can be used for irrigation or even filtered for household use.
- **Low-Flow Fixtures:** Implement low-flow faucets and showerheads to minimize water usage. These fixtures reduce water flow without sacrificing performance.
- **Greywater Systems:** Consider a greywater reuse system that recycles water from sinks, showers, and washing machines for irrigation.

### Materials and Resources

Choosing the right materials is crucial in tiny home design. Opt for sustainable options that are both durable and environmentally friendly.

Check Details Here: https://blogmoneyweb.com/tiny-home-ideas  
  
- **Reclaimed Wood:** Using reclaimed wood not only gives your home character but also reduces the need for new materials. It‚Äôs a stylish choice that promotes sustainability.
- **Bamboo:** Bamboo is a fast-growing plant that serves as an excellent building material due to its strength and versatility. It's particularly suitable for flooring and furniture.
- **Recycled Materials:** Look for furniture and fixtures made from recycled materials. They can be equally stylish and functional while reducing waste in landfills.

### Green Features

Green features into your tiny home can elevate its sustainability and comfort.

- **Green Roof:** If possible, consider adding a green roof to your tiny abode. It provides insulation, reduces stormwater runoff, and promotes biodiversity.
- **Natural Ventilation:** Design your home to maximize airflow. Properly placed windows and vents can help reduce the need for air conditioning and enhance indoor air quality.
- **Compost Toilets:** These eco-friendly toilets turn waste into compost, significantly reducing your water usage and minimizing your environmental impact.

### Space Optimization

In a tiny home, every inch matters. Creative space optimization contributes to sustainability by reducing the need for excess materials.

Check Details Here: https://blogmoneyweb.com/tiny-home-ideas  
  
- **Multi-Functional Furniture:** Choose furniture that has multiple uses. For example, a bed with storage underneath or a table that can fold away helps you maximize your space.
- **Vertical Solutions:** Use vertical space for storage. Shelves and wall-mounted units can free up floor space and keep clutter at bay.
- **Sliding Doors:** Instead of traditional hinged doors, opt for sliding doors to save space and enhance accessibility.

By embracing these sustainable design elements, you can create a tiny home that is not only environmentally friendly but also comfortable and stylish. Each choice you make contributes to a lifestyle that values sustainability without sacrificing quality or comfort. The result is a space that reflects your commitment to both personal living and global stewardship.

Small changes can lead to significant impacts. Whether you're starting from scratch or retrofitting an existing tiny home, considering sustainable design elements will ensure that you live in a way that is harmonious with nature.

### Conclusion

Embracing tiny home living opens the door to a world of creativity and sustainability. By implementing innovative ideas that maximize space efficiency, you can create a cozy, functional environment tailored to your lifestyle. Think multifunctional furniture or clever storage solutions‚Äîthese options not only save space but enhance your quality of life.

Sustainable design elements further elevate the tiny home experience. Using eco-friendly materials, harnessing solar energy, or incorporating rainwater collection systems not only reduces your carbon footprint but also aligns with the ethos of responsible living. Every small step can lead to significant impacts, both for you and the planet.

Combining effective space management with sustainable practices allows you to create a haven that is not only aesthetically pleasing but also kind to the environment. Whether you're starting from scratch or renovating an existing space, considering these tiny home ideas can lead to a more enjoyable and impactful lifestyle.

With old beans, perhaps my assumptions are flawed, but assumed less water would be extracted as they soaked some up, but that could be an asinine assumption. ;)

I am going to buy some locally roasted fresh beans tomorrow, but is there some variable I am overlooking that would cause everything to be over the target except the output being way more than expected?

I expected it when I was grinding too coarse and the shots were pulling in 10-20 seconds, but once I crossed the 30 second threshold, I thought the volume out would decline close to the 2:1 ratio target, but no dice. :(

I‚Äôm so nervous to make any type of move, asked her to get coffee and she said yes, it was a smooth time. Literally haven‚Äôt texted her for three whole days because I‚Äôm just that nervous to mess things up. 

The wild thing about all of this is, I‚Äôve honestly never had a problem getting women, ever. Dating apps or the club it just doesn‚Äôt matter, getting a girl in bed just isn‚Äôt hard for me. But in all of my adventures I have developed one hell of a flaw, legitimately courting someone in pursuit of a relationship is difficult for me and I have no idea why. Where did my confidence go? I told her that I liked her and I was so nervous I got nauseous. 

She said I was handsome and cool. I know the assignment is to be consistent and communicate, but I‚Äôm stuck in my own head about all of the possibilities that could go wrong. It‚Äôs also wild of me to do this because we work with each other, I have a rule against dating coworkers‚Ä¶but the thought of her just bothered me too much. I‚Äôm taking things slow and steady to protect our work lives.

Is prioritizing career/networking early in undergrad more important, or is maintaining a high GPA more important? I'm trying to find a job in finance/consulting. 

It may be possible to do both if I just get more efficient with studying, but I feel like for some finance classes they require a bit more time and effort on my part to truly understand.

I have a 15x22 room that needs to be a Jack of all trades. 

The exterior long wall (22 feet) is all windows. 

The tv is mounted on the wall on one end of the room. The sofa divides the space. 

The other end is a Murphy bed. On each side of the Murphy bed are Ikea Billy bookcases. Right now those bookcases are turned sideways. I‚Äôm going to attempt to install castors on them so u can slide them out when I need stuff off of them.  I thought that would maximize space ‚Äî and it has. I currently have three Billy bookcases but I‚Äôve been picking them up off of Craigslist when I see them so I hope to add 2-3 more as space allows. 

I have a wallpaper mural which I am installing on 4 pieces of foam insulation board 4x8 each. Those will be used as a moving ‚Äúwall‚Äù to visually block off the storage / Murphy bed side of the room when it‚Äôs not in use. When the bed is in use the mural can be moved forward and will serve as a visual barrier between the sofa and the bed offering the person using the bed some privacy. 

I also have two pax wardrobes with mirror doors. I honestly wanted the Billy bookcases to be pax wardrobes as they hold a lot of stuff but I can‚Äôt afford to buy them new and haven‚Äôt found more second hand at a reasonable price. The pax wardrobes are on the wall opposing the windows.  

The amount of uses I need to include in this space are quite a lot. We need a small dining area for 2-3 people. 

I need a work area with some sort of desk situation. The desk and table could be incorporated but I would love it if they are separate. 

I am struggling to make all of this work. The table I have now is too big and needs to go. In my mind I‚Äôm visualizing either a small round bistro table or something that is long and narrow and can kind of fit like a console table behind the sofa. 

I need at least one end table by the sofa. I‚Äôm not planning a coffee table due to space limitations but it would be nice to have one - particularly if it can incorporate storage. 

Help please.

I am at a loss of what to do,"Hi all, 24m recently diagnosed with ADHD. Apologies for the long read, but I felt that the more thorough I am, the better it is for others in the future.

My habits: I exercise 3x a week, eat relatively well, and sleep relatively well. I consume caffeine and nicotine.

My environment: Working full-time, recently graduated from uni, and currently studying for a difficult med school exam.

I have been taking Ritalin IR 10mg x 2/3 a day since mid-October 24. It was working wonders for weeks without any issues. However, as of recently, I have been noticing it causing anxiety¬†**sometimes**. I was not able to find someone in a similar situation and wanted to gauge what other people's experiences are like.

I'd like to preface that I was also able to drink caffeine in the morning and afternoon whilst taking my medication, with 0 issues.

The first time it happened, I was on the plane and I decided to take 10mg IR and study during the flight. I don't like flying and thought this would be a good way to distract myself. Boy was I wrong. 45 minutes after I took it, I had a rush of heat through my body and a rapid increase in HR. This freaked me out and sent me into nearly having a panic attack. I was able to relax quickly and decided not to take it on the plane anymore. While I was on my trip, I took a 3-week break. After coming back home, I resumed taking it 10mg, 2/3x a day, and all was fine.

Until 1 week in. I nearly had another panic attack but was able to calm myself down quickly and continue studying. At this point, I nearly had two panic attacks. The next day, I took it, and again, all was fine. For some reason, I started thinking how unpleasant the feeling of nearly having a panic attack was. The genuine fear that floods your brain and the elevated physical symptoms are unpleasant, to say the least. I decided to take only 5mg, but even just taking it made me anxious straight away, before it had a chance to be absorbed. I had a pretty rough hour not being able to get out of my head. All sorts of negative thoughts flooded me, an all-around terrible experience.

After that, I decided to take a 2-day break and let my whole body rest with extra sleep. This brings us to yesterday. I dropped down to 1 coffee and I took 2.5mg. I instantly felt anxious about taking it, to the point that I was about to go throw it up. I stuck with my logic of - if I vomit it out now, I will give into the anxiety I have created in my head and will have this reaction every time. The anxious feeling went away, and I continued to take 5mg later that day, with no issues.

At this point, I think the anxiousness stems from thinking of the possibility of having a panic attack. This feeds back into my thoughts, making me more aware of my physical state (heart rate, sweat, and bodily sensations). I am aware that it is trial and error, but the thought of changing to XR meds freaks me out a little. Whereas IR lasts 4h, XR is 10-12h. The thought makes me anxious that I will be stuck in that state for a very long time. I will have a consultation with my psychiatrist.

Things I've tried.

* Eating more, and eating less before taking it. I heard that Ritalin dissolves better in acidic environments.
* Reducing to 1 coffee. Still was anxious, but it stemmed from my fears, rather than medication itself. I previously was also able to consume caffeine alongside the meds without issues.
* Changing my outlook on the situation, reassuring myself that everything is fine.",1,1735443666.0,ausadhd,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm reaching out here because I‚Äôm feeling a bit stuck and could really use some advice from others who have been through this.

I recently launched my brand , a low-caffeine coffee alternative made with organic mushrooms. It‚Äôs been two years in the making, and I‚Äôve poured so much into it. After months of research, planning, and building, the launch went live a couple of weeks ago.

**Here‚Äôs the issue I‚Äôm facing:** I‚Äôve been trying to reach out to **micro-influencers** on Instagram, primarily in the wellness, health, and coffee spaces, but I can‚Äôt seem to get anyone to respond. I‚Äôve sent **hundreds of invites**, manually researched influencers with follower counts between 5,000 to 50,000 (as well some 100k - 500k), and used multiple platforms and apps through Shopify to connect with influencers. I‚Äôve been very clear in my approach and sent personalized, friendly messages, offering a **free product** and proposing collaboration opportunities.

Despite all my efforts, **nobody is responding**. I‚Äôve also tried using a Shopify app with good resources and tips for reaching out, but again, no traction. I‚Äôm getting frustrated, as I thought influencers would be a great way to spread the word about my product, especially since it's a niche product with a lot of potential for micro-influencers.

I‚Äôm asking, has anyone been through this and found a way to make it work? What are some strategies that have worked for you? Any advice on how I can break through and start connecting with influencers?

I‚Äôm really just trying to make it work and not get discouraged, but at this point, I‚Äôm feeling a bit stuck. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.

I've never made a post but I've asked a few friends their opinion about this girl I met a few weeks back. I'll give a rundown real quick. We are the same age she plays volleyball at a college near by and I first saw her at a coffee shop staring at me and glanced over while talking to my friends then looked over to see her looking at me and then it happened again while we were on our way out as well. Second time was the next day I decided to go to the game and after the game went to get food real quick with some buddies and was heading back to my car when she walked around the corner and we ran into each other so I decided to start a convo and it went really well and she and I just exchanged basic stuff about each other and she hoped to see me at the next game. Next game I go to I obviously see her and we are looking at each other throughout the game (this is a championship game) her coach calls timeout and during the huddle she turns around and waves and her teammates and coach look at me then look at her and then she got pulled to the side and got benched lol. Then following week is another tournament same thing happens again we look at each other and she smiles and does a disrete wave and smiles and her coached didn't see this time but her teammates did lol.

1hon49c,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodieSnark/comments/1hon49c/half_baked_harvest_vs_coffee/,Half Baked Harvest vs. Coffee,"You guys, the weather is keeping me home tonight from a post-Christmas pre-New Year's party, which is very frustrating, so I'm going to take my irritation out on some of Tieghan's crimes against coffee. They bother me. Less so than the cooking, but why would someone do that to innocent coffee? 

I'm going to be talking a fair amount on the stupidity of the calorie counts involved here, so if that bothers you I would skip this one. 

Right off the hop we're going to address the latte thing. Tieghan seems to believe that anything involving coffee is a latte, when by definition a latte is espresso, steamed milk, and foam. Brewed coffee with steamed milk is a cafe au lait (or, in Starbucks parlance, a caffe misto), although you will see a certain amount of online recipes advocating for brewed coffee in a ""latte."" Is it correct? Not really, but since most people don't have espresso machines at home, I'm willing to accept this definition for a homemade one. Although the steamed milk thing actively annoys me. But that's before we get into all the other horrifying additions. 

I'm already annoyed and irritated. Let's get started. 

Way back in the archives we find our place at the starting blocks with the [Coconut Pumpkin Spice Latte](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/coconut-pumpkin-spice-latte/) and don't worry, it's all downhill from here. 

>For those of you who love pumpkin spice latte, but hate all the ‚Äúbad for you‚Äù things about it, I have good, GOOOD news! I went and made a healthy version, and I promise it‚Äôs better than anything any barista could serve you (and cheaper too!). Like it‚Äôs so flipping delicious and creamy, and pumpkiny and cinnamony and‚Ä¶ well, perfect!


You know, I actually doubt that it's better, because a barista is going to serve me an espresso-based latte with properly steamed milk that I didn't have to make myself. Also, the calorie counter on this (which is probably inaccurate anyway but whatever) clocks in at 936 calories PER DRINK. What in the Kentucky fried fuck is that. A venti PSL from Starbucks is under 500. What's going on here, I wonder, as I look more closely at the ingredients? 

>1 1/2 c canned coconut milk


Oh, there it is. Coconut milk is delicious but famously heavy in calories! That's what makes it good! That's also why it's not a super common substitute for just plain drinking milk the same way that soy or almond or other plant-based milk substitutes can be! Lots of coconut milk latte recipes have some, for flavour, and then a different, lighter milk alternative to keep them from being just DRINKING COCONUT MILK. 

>Oh, and the latte is really pretty quick and easy to make. My guess is that you already have all the ingredients on hand right now.


Sounds all right. 

>In a large 4 cup glass measuring cup, combine the coffee grounds and Zico Organic Fair Trade Coconut Water. Cover and let sit at room temperature overnight or up to 4 days in the fridge.


And we're already off the rails. Anything that starts off with ""overnight"" is not something I would call ""quick"" but sure. It's coffee. Let's say I just make a coffee in the French press like a human instead of a cold brew, shall we? 

>In a small sauce pan, combine the pumpkin, pumpkin pie spice, a tiny pinch of black pepper and the maple syrup. Cook the mixture, stirring often until the pumpkin is hot and fragrant. 


Ok so two things about this: I really hate the addition of real pumpkin to stuff like this for a few reasons. Pumpkin puree really doesn't have a lot of flavour to it on its own, as anyone who's tasted it can tell you, and 95% of the flavour in a pumpkin-spice-anything are THE SPICES. Cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves are all delicious! Also it's a classic ""Wow! This Recipe Uses A Tablespoon Of Something That Comes In A Big Jar"" (h/t Reductress) for two damn Tbsp of puree that comes in a can the size of a softball. The pumpkin is not what's becoming fragrant here, Tieghan! It's THE SPICES. 

>Cook the mixture, stirring often until the pumpkin is hot and fragrant. Slowly stir in the coconut milk, 1/2 cup Zico Organic Fair Trade Coconut Water and vanilla. Bring the mixture to a low simmer, stirring often to ensure the mixture does not boil over. When then mixture is steaming hot, remove it from the heat. Using a small whisk or a fork, whisk with all your might until frothy (or add to a blender and blend for 1 minute). Now take the warm coffee and if needed reheat on the stove or for one minute in the microwave. Pour in a mug and then add the frothed milk mixture. Top with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon if desired.


What the hell is the point of even giving that a ""1"" to start off with?? Break it up into steps! And the thought of frothing all this damn coconut milk with a FORK makes me want to die inside. Get a hand frother, Tieghan. It's like seven dollars. 

Let's jump ahead to 2018 and see if things have improved at all with the [Spiced Pumpkin Maple Latte](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pumpkin-spice-pecan-latte/) but I'm guessing they haven't. 

>Made with just 4 simple, healthy, ingredients, all found in your pantry.


I'll be the judge of that, Tieghan. I'll be the judge of that. 

>To start, make a batch of my spiced pumpkin butter. 


Already we're off to a bad start. I don't have this in my pantry and I wouldn't really call it simple, if I'm being honest. I get that it's not complicated to make, but it is time-consuming and the fuck I  am making it for THIS. 

And from the spiced pumpkin butter recipe notes, let's get onto a sidebar with this: 
>To all the bakers out there yelling at me to use real sugar pie pumpkins, and to make my own puree, I‚Äôm sorry, but not really. Sometimes life gives you shortcuts. You shouldn‚Äôt always take them, but sometimes you should. And in the case of homemade pumpkin butter, you should take this shortcut and use the canned pumpkin.

Tieghan, if I were you, I wouldn't even be bringing up stuff like this with who might or might not be mad at you. Secondly, making pumpkin butter isn't baking. Third, most bakers will use canned pumpkin for a lot of stuff because cooking down a damn pie pumpkin is a lot of work and a lot more variable than using a can of Libby's. 

>In a small saucepan, mix up your favorite milk (goat milk is my usual go-to, but coconut milk, oat milk, whole milk, almond milk, and skim milk will all work).


I like how this implies that ""whole milk"" and ""skim milk"" are so wildly different. Actually, if you were steaming milk on an espresso bar you'd know that they are, but I don't even want to get into the varying fat and protein contents and how they affect milk steaming with Tieghan because I fear that's a fool's errand. 

>What‚Äôs great about this latte is that while it feels indulgent, it not loaded with sweetener and a million other things that most coffee shops use. So you don‚Äôt have to feel an ounce of guilt while sipping this.


""it not loaded"" good start. Additionally, what the hell do you think that maple syrup in your spiced pumpkin butter is doing??? SWEETENING THINGS. It's a sweetener. Most coffee shops serving a pumpkin spice latte are going to have espresso, steamed milk of some variety, pumpkin spice syrup, and whipped cream if you prefer. You can argue about the content of the syrups if you like but good syrup brands are going to be using decent-quality sweeteners as well. 1883 uses only cane sugar. ""A million other things"" tell me you don't frequent good-quality coffee shops without telling me.

Also the calorie count on this one is also bonkers off, because it's saying 166 calories per serving and again there's like 600 calories in 3/4 c of full-fat coconut milk, which is what Tieghan recommends and that's before even getting into the lashings of whipped cream. What is going on with the advocacy of coconut milk? It has SUCH a strong flavour! I really like coconut but I don't think it goes with everything! 

Katie says:
>I was really excited to craft this speciality drink. Unfortunately with the full fat coconut milk, it was just too heavy on my stomach. I might try it with 2% or another milk next time.


Katie, I wish you had found a reputable food blog who could have circumvented this for you. The thought of drinking almost an entire can of hot coconut milk, even mixed with coffee, makes me want to die. 

Taylor says:
>That latte looks and sounds amazing! If only the coffee places would catch on and make lattes more wholesome! Not to be a complete curmudgeon but are you honestly recommending a $60 mug as a must have? Yes, it is lovely, but ‚Äì goodness ‚Äì they offer a payment plan for it!


Tieghan replies:
>I am so glad you like this latte, Taylor! Thank you!


Is Tieghan aware you don't have to respond to every comment by law? What the fuck. 

For yet ANOTHER variant on the pumpkin spice latte, let's see the [Pumpkin Spice Pecan Latte](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pumpkin-spice-pecan-latte/) from just this past fall. 

>For years, my go-to homemade pumpkin latte has been made with pumpkin butter, milk, and hot espresso.


Lies, the damn recipe calls for brewed coffee. 

>Strain the pecans away from the syrup and place on the prepared baking sheet. 


This is just such a bizarre way of saying it. Don't you mean ""strain the pecans out of the syrup""? And in the narrative she says to do it with a fork...like, I'm not an expert chef and I have a small little sieve I could use for exactly this purpose in 4 seconds instead of torturing myself chasing pecans out of boiling syrup with a fork. 

Sarah asks:
>Is there anything I can use to substitute for the pumpkin butter?


Tieghan replies:
>Hey Sarah,
I would highly recommend the pumpkin butter:) You could try some pumpkin puree, I just haven‚Äôt tested that.


Jesus wept, Tieghan, do you understand ANYTHING about the fucking food you make??? Pumpkin puree tastes like NOTHING. (I do genuinely love pumpkin, lest it sound like I'm slamming it for no reason, but I recognize it's a fairly wimpy vegetable in the flavour category which is why it takes spices so damn well.) Do you really think that substituting a flavourful, spiced ingredient with a watery, un-flavoured squash is going to taste good???? DO YOU???

This has made me so angry we're going to move onto the [Toasted Coconut Chocolate Pumpkin Spice Latte with Chocolate Drizzle](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/toasted-coconut-chocolate-pumpkin-spice-latte-chocolate-drizzle/) which is just too many fucking flavours, I'm sorry. 

>But then, I went to get out all the ingredients and as I was pulling out the vanilla I dropped a can of coconut milk right on my big toe. FUDGE! That hurt like heck and I then proceeded to  jump around for good two minutes singing ‚Äúowe, owe, owe, owe‚Äù. The I was like oh, wait. TOASTED COCONUT CHOCOLATE PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE!


Okay, this is from 2013 when Tieghan was just a kid, but it's fascinating to me how little the writing style has matured in eleven years. I also fail to see how dropping a can of coconut milk on your toe could lead to that revelation, but sure. 

This recipe calling for 3/4 c + 1 Tbsp canned coconut milk also claims to be clocking in at 255 calories, but sure. 

>In a glass measuring cup or microwave-safe bowl, whisk together 3/4 cup coconut milk, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, and pumpkin pie spice. Microwave for 1 to 2 minutes, but watch closely to make sure the milk does not boil over. Remove from the microwave when the coconut milk is hot.


I unironically love this. It's so funny and such a departure from Tieghan today. This 2013 ""latte"" is just microwaved milk and brewed coffee, there's not even any frothed milk. Once you've dumped 4 Tbsp of hot cocoa mix into that much coconut milk, are you even going to taste the 1/4 teaspoon of pumpkin spice that's in there???? I'm too lazy and too drunk to test it. Also, please check out the photos on this one in particular, because the same photo pops up like four times. It's hilarious. 

Things really go off the rails in 2017 with the [Pumpkin Spice Oatmeal Latte](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pumpkin-spice-oatmeal-latte/) and if you are me, you probably assumed this would be a normal PSL made with oat milk, which would probably taste good. Oh no. Oh no. Oh no no no no no. Please join me as we board the express to Batshit Station. This train makes no stops. 

>Thing is? I LOVE all pumpkiny the ideas.


Please, Tieghan. A proofreader. Failing that, just reading through these damn things before hitting ""post."" It takes 2 minutes. I'm begging you. ""All pumpkiny the ideas"" I can't. 

This recipe is based on (read: stolen from) a cafe in Breckenridge, and I would be willing to try their oatmeal latte, made appropriately in latte style with espresso and steamed milk. That might be good! This doesn't sound good. 

>Their oatmeal latte kind of got me thinking, ‚Äúwhat if I put a fall twist on this? Like um, pumpkin pie spice! yes, yes, yes, I need to do this‚Äù. My brain, it‚Äôs weird, but at least it can come up with some pretty yummy recipes, so I got that going for me‚Ä¶


Pumpkin pie spices, for fall. Groundbreaking. I'm not even going to touch the proofreading again, it makes me too sad. All of this makes me sad. 

>Just steam some milk with a little pumpkin


Okay now I know for sure but Tieghan doesn't understand what steaming milk actually is. I'm pretty sure she thinks it means to heat something until it's steaming. (Much like how to caramelize something doesn't mean ""cook til it's the brown colour of caramel.) TO STEAM MILK REQUIRES STEAM. It's right in the name! I know I'm screaming into the void here but just heating milk does not have the same effect!!! This is why when you get a latte from a good coffee shop you get the wonderful sound of steaming milk and a lovely, velvety texture produced by aerating milk and dispersing the fat throughout it to give you that delicious microfoam! If it were just hot milk, every coffee shop on planet earth would have a hot milk machine. Fuck me. This Belgian Moon is starting to taste like I might be yelling. 

Also, calories per serving? 1101. Google tells me there's about 110 calories in 3/4 c whole milk, recommended for this, plus maybe another 150 for oats? Did I miss the part where you make the coffee by injecting it with pure butter? I'm so fucking confused. No wonder people are irritated by these damn calorie counts. They make no fucking sense. 

Amy says:
>Very milky. Next time I‚Äôll used almond milk. Mine wasn‚Äôt nearly as frothy. Thanks, though!


Amy, I'm so sorry, it's because destroying all the muscle fiber in your arm trying to froth milk with a fork isn't worth it. I don't want to have to ice my arm like an MLB pitcher just to make breakfast. 

Trying to get away from the pumpkin before I have to go drown myself in the sink, let's see what's going on with the [Salted Caramel Brulee Latte](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/caramel-brulee-latte/) which honestly, I don't understand. When I worked at Starbucks people went absolutely FERAL for this thing and the syrup was so thick it was a full-body workout just to pump it. 

>Once the milk is steaming, add a splash of vanilla, then whisk or froth everything for a minute or two to make the milk a little frothy.


I think I've fully explained why steamed milk actually means something, but here we are again. Crying into our hot milk. 

>You can easily make this vegan by using your favorite nut-based milk.


Oh, Tieghan. Tieghan, Tieghan, Tieghan. Do you think substituting almond milk is going to make this vegan after you call for caramel sauce in it? Even YOUR OWN caramel sauce which includes both heavy cream AND BUTTER? What do you think vegan means, exactly? I'll also point out that the caramel brulee topping calls for granulated sugar, and some strict vegans won't eat white sugar because it's processed with bone char. But I certainly wouldn't expect Tieghan, an alleged food expert, to be aware of nuances like that. She's not Google. 

Also, speaking of caramel, it calls for 2-3 Tbsp caramel sauce, ""homemade or store bought."" Which, thanks, those are indeed the two ways you can procure caramel sauce. But the link provided for ""caramel sauce"" actually leads to a cookie recipe USING caramel sauce where the sauce recipe is buried at the bottom. And! Shockingly!! It includes instructions for cooking at elevation!!! And gives a TEMPERATURE!!!! For use with a candy thermometer!!!!! Where did she steal [the recipe](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/bourbon-caramel-pretzel-cookies/) from, I want to know. 

The [Vanilla Gingerbread Latte](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/vanilla-gingerbread-latte/) recipe is honestly basically exactly the same as all the rest and I feel like if we all took a shot for every time Tieghan incorrectly refers to heating milk on the stovetop ""until steaming"" as ""steaming milk,"" we'd be dead by morning. 

Breanna asks:
>Hello, I‚Äôve tried making this a couple of times as it sounds amazing but each time the liquid has split (before I‚Äôve added the coffee). Any idea why this might be?


Tieghan responds:
>Hey Breanna,
So sorry to hear this, do you mean your milk for the latte? Is it hot enough? xTieghan


Honestly, I bet ten American dollars what's happened is that Breanna has let the milk get too hot, like to a full boil, which causes the fats in the milk to separate. (In cow's milk, at least--I'm not sure what would happen to a nut milk.) So once again Tieghan is demonstrating for us that she doesn't understand the science behind the food she's making, because the milk getting TOO hot is the issue here. Not that it isn't hot enough. Why the hell would that cause it to split. 

Kristen says:
>Hi!
This looks amazing- I don‚Äôt drink coffee- if I leave it out should I adjust the amounts of anything else?


Tieghan says:
>Hi Kristen,
A latte is made with coffee, if you omit that I really don‚Äôt know how this would taste. Let me know if you give it a try! xTieghan


What an unnecessarily bitchy response. And untrue, if you get down to it, because as mentioned a latte is made with espresso, not brewed coffee. Also, really? You can't fucking guess what hot milk and sweeteners and spices would taste like, RECIPE DEVELOPER???? 

Finally, to wind up with, though I could keep going and crying about milk for hours still, let's have a look at a recipe with a ton of bad reviews for a change, the [Chocolate Bourbon Chai Latte Cupcakes with Butter Pecan Frosting](https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/chocolate-bourbon-chai-latte-cupcakes/) where again we have TOO MANY FLAVOURS going on. Are you even going to taste bourbon in this? Are you going to taste CHAI? It's too busy. Pick two of those things and move on. 

So the overwhelming response in the comments is that these cupcakes come out dry. I haven't made these myself (and shall not, because I actually like food), but what I suspect has happened here is that Tieghan has taken a recipe from somewhere else and changed too much about it to really make it work. It calls for 1/2 c melted coconut oil as the fat and 1 1/2 c flour plus 3/4 c cocoa in the dry, which I think is the root of the issue. The ratios are way off. Sally's recipe for chocolate cupcakes is 3/4 c flour + 1/2 c cocoa to 1/3 c fat. That's before we even get into the weirdness with bake times for altitude.

>A hard no. I bake often and followed directions. The cupcakes were ‚Äúok‚Äù as soon as they came out of the oven but quickly became heavy and dry, like they were a few days old. The frosting also did not turn out and required more sugar than the recipe stated, otherwise was runny (and yes I properly chilled). Look elsewhere before you waste time and ingredients. Off to the bakery to grab something to replace these:-(.


Tanya says:
>Hello. My daughter and I made these tonight and we also had the same dry, dense issue as the other commenters. We noticed the batter was thick like a brownie batter so we added more milk and baked for 15 mins. 


Tieghan replies: 
>Hi Tanya,
Happy Thanksgiving! Thanks for making this recipe and your comment, so glad to hear it was a hit! Sorry to hear it was dense, I‚Äôm not sure why that is happening for some people! xx


It's because your recipe is trash, Tieghan. Hope this helps! 

Honestly, recommending these bake for 22-25 minutes is also probably part of the issue. I'd check cupcakes at 15 minutes and probably wouldn't go too far beyond 18-19 minutes, but my oven runs hot. 22 minutes to start with is asking for trouble. 

Geri asks:
>I‚Äôm guessing I could use melted butter instead of coconut oil. What do you think? Can‚Äôt wait to try these delicious looking cupcakes! Also, what is the amount of chocolate chunks you used?


Tieghan says:
>Hey Geri,
Totally, that will work well for you! I used 1 bar of chocolate chunks if you want to add those. Let me know if you give this recipe a try, I hope you love it! xT


What? What are we talking about? The photos show chopped chocolate going into the batter but it's never mentioned anywhere. And also...WHAT chocolate bar? HOW MUCH? 170 g of baker's chocolate? A 200g full-size Cadbury bar? A single Hershey's bar? What the fuck is happening. 

Beth says:
>The frosting is delicious but a bit soupy and the cupcake is not sweet at all. Any suggestions on how to improve?


Tieghan replies: 
>Sounds like your frosting needs some more powdered sugar. I guess you could add more sugar to the cupcake to your liking. I hope this helps! xx


What the fuck. THIS is the place you could recommend adding chopped chocolate, not randomly adding sugar to a recipe that ALREADY has structural issues, you dim fucking bulb. 

Kimberly says:
>I love HBH recipes, but it is frustrating seeing ingredients used in photos and them not being included in the recipes. I have also noticed that some ingredients in other recipes are listed in the ingredient list but not in the written instructions.


Tieghan replies: 
>Happy Sunday! I appreciate you making this recipe and sharing your feedback, so glad to hear it was delish! The chocolate chunks are not needed for this recipe:) If an ingredient is ever missing from the list I always try to fix it as quickly as possible. We are human over here so we do make mistakes:) Thanks again for trying so many recipes! xx


For fuck's sake. This many, over this long of a period of time, is not a normal humans-making-mistakes. This is a deliberate choice to prioritize visuals over clarity and quality of production in your cooking. If you think chocolate is a good addition, include it in your fucking recipe. If you don't, don't put a god damn photo of it in there. 

Amor says:
>I made these for Thanksgiving and my frosting came out a little watery, not sure where I went wrong but I did add a little bit of flour to thicken and more powder sugar. Any other suggestion is greatly appreciated if that happens again.


Tieghan replies: 
>Hi Amor,
So sorry to hear this! I would never add flour to a frosting, just powdered sugar:) xx


Right, flour is only for seasoning roasts before putting them in the slow cooker to impart that delicious floury flavour we all know and love. 

Denise says:
>I‚Äôve made several of these HBH recipes and I must say probably I won‚Äôt be making anymore. What is shown in the videos and pictures doesn‚Äôt seem to be the recipe that is shared online? Not sure where the disconnect is? Is it measurement issues? Altitude vs non-altitude? I‚Äôm baffled why the adjustments for altitude are not given for baking recipes. I am an experienced cook and have been able to determine what is going to work vs not for some things but these cupcakes for example, were not moist, as others have said, even after adjusting for a shorter cook time. 


No response to that one. Because Tieghan doesn't know enough about baking to address why this is a failed recipe. 

Natalie asks:
>These look so amazing! Does the alcohol cook/bake off so this is safe for pregnancy and kids?

Tieghan answers: 
>Hey Natalie,
Thanks so much!! It does, but if you are worried about it, you can use milk in place of the bourbon. Please let me know if you have any other questions, I hope you love this recipe! xx


[buzzer sounds again] Incorrect again, Tieghan! All alcohol content does not disappear during the baking process! Depending on how long stuff is cooked for it can retain a pretty significant percentage of alcohol. Now, considering there are THREE TABLESPOONS of bourbon in FIFTEEN CUPCAKES I wouldn't be concerned about the impact of giving this to a child or pregnant woman because it is the equivalent of 3 ml of bourbon per cupcake, which is just about 1/2 teaspoon and that's before even considering that it is going to be cooked, further reducing the percentage of actual alcohol. Of course I would make it clear to anyone eating my baked goods that they had alcohol in them, but I'd be much more concerned about an observant religious person eating it than a 7-year-old. Sourdough bread is about 0.5% ABV, for heaven's sake. But anyway, the point here is that Tieghan is once again wrong. (This is the same thing that annoys me about when people say they don't want to include 1/2 c of coffee in a cake recipe that makes 12-16 servings. It's the equivalent of 2 tsp of coffee per slice of cake. The chocolate in the cake is going to be worse.) 

Colleen adds:
>This recipe is outstanding and highly recommend it to everyone! But if you google ‚Äúalcohol in baking‚Äù you‚Äôll find that the research is showing it takes about 3 hrs of boiling alcohol to reduce its potency. Hope this helps clear up confusion. Baking it will not cook it off.


Tieghan responds:
>Hey Colleen,
Wonderful!! Thanks so much for making this recipe, I love to hear that it was enjoyed!! Happy Thanksgiving! ü¶É


What. 

Erica asks: 
>Do you know how long to bake this if I were to make a cake instead of cupcakes?


Tieghan replies: 
>Hey Erica,
I‚Äôve never made this as a cake, but I would start checking for doneness at 45 minutes. I hope you love this recipe, please let me know if you give it a try! xx


FORTY-FIVE MINUTES? Even adjusting for altitude that is absolutely batshit insane. You can bake a whole damn loaf of banana bread, famously moist and dense, in that time. Thank goodness two commenters are right there to say they did so in 15 minutes but good GOD. Start CHECKING at forty-five minutes? Your smoke alarm will warn you way before that point! What the hell kind of ordinary chocolate cake requires FORTY-FIVE MINUTES in the oven? And because I am unreasonable, I checked and all Tieghan's other chocolate cake recipes have normal bake times of 25-30 minutes for rounds and 30-35 minutes for sheets! This woman does not bake. I am so angry I'm going to have to go bake some cookies just to become less angry. Which I will be able to do correctly on my first try because I KNOW HOW TO BAKE. And maybe I need a latte tomorrow.

1hon1q6,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1hon1q6/are_my_expectations_high_or_does_my_partner_have/,Are my expectations high or does my partner have little/no respect for me?,"First off let me say sorry in advance if my story is a bit all over the place, I will try my hardest to keep it flowing nicely! I also suck at spelling so if there's some errors, oops!!
I'll start with a smidgen of background, lay that foundation. My partner and I have been together for 8 years now. We got together when we were young me 20f him 18m, we are now 28 and 26. We have definitely gone through many, MANY changes as people and as a couple.(as one would expect from 8 years!) We have grown, we have laughed, we have cried. During those years we have made 4 little humans and got engaged 5 years ago.(no, no wedding in sight, that's it's own van of worms)
Although there have been changes, and character development, one thing seems to have stayed relatively the same when I really get thinking about it-our respect for each other. In a lot of ways it has gone up and we have gained mutual respect for one another in different aspects of each other's lives BUT! at the end of the day I feel as though I'm not respected in my beliefs or wishes. I'm starting to question if he ever has, or ever will...(some more background)I am a stay at home mum of 4 children aged 6,5,2 and 6 months. It's a lot of friggin work and I sometimes fail at getting the house to look nice, or a good dinner isn't always made when he comes home. I'm not perfect in a lot of ways, I have a lot of growing to do, but I'm trying! I have always suffered from depression and I got really bad pd(postpartum depression) after some of my children. Like said, I'm trying! I think he sees this and is very kind and understanding and is very quick to help in his own way. Sometimes his frustration shows and it definitely sets me back and puts me in a weird mood. I can't blame him, it just sucks and I wish I could be and do better...

Now for how I feel he doesn't respect me and my wishes. I'll give a few examples that grind my gears the most.
To start, he doesn't follow the rules of the house that I have set/been trying to set for SIX damn years.These things I have set are not crazy or extreme, they are honestly so simple and what I imagine every house has set as ""rules"". This makes me angry because it's showing our kids that they don't have to follow rules set in place and can do whatever they want. I think it is extremely disrespectful for our house and towards me...A big one of these rules he is constantly bending is food should be eaten at the table. He refuses to practice this and anytime he feeds the kids he let's them eat at the couch or wherever. It doesn't matter what kid of food it is, it's allowed where ever they want. He also won't wipe them down or the surfaces we eat on. The kids will be allowed to leave and walk around with dirty hands. Ew. And food on the table(and couch) and around the house? My job to clean up.
Another thing is garbage. I always ask and remind him that garbage goes in the garage and recycling in the recycling. He always mixes them. Even bottles and cans end up in the garbage..

This one isn't really a house rule but more of just something that happems in the house, it's bedtime. This man will sit on his computer for hours each night (and if it's a day off pretty much all day) and almost always let me do bedtime by myself. All four kids.. bedtime can take me upwards of 2-3 hours depending how each child is behaving. It doesn't matter if I ask for help, he just continues on with his computer.
The last one just happened today and is what pushed me to write this post. This is also the one that makes me wonder if I expect to much or if he's just an ass. As people do, we both go out from time to time. Whenever I am out it can be anywhere from an hour upwards of 3.I always usually come back early cause I have too come deal with the kids. In this time I am always out doing some kind of errand with a mix of personal time (the errand is almost always shopping as I am 98% the sole one responsible for groceries)The personal time is a coffee to go along with my shopping haha. In this time I will keep in contact with text and, a good chunk of time on the phone with him. When he goes out he is gone anywhere from 1-7 hours depending the outing. And usually doesn't have much contact with me. I know he doesn't have to but it would be nice to know what he's up to/where he is going to be. What if something is wrong at home or happened to him and I have no clue where he is or when he is going to be home? Low key, stresses me tf out. I like to know when people are coming and going as I need to plan my day around it. Today was 7 hours, I don't care that he had little contact throughout cause he was with our eldest kid and they were with his friend having quality time. So whatever,  cool, you do you. What does bother me is he knew I had running around to do today, and he knew this cause I asked the eldest yesterday if she wanted to join me and make a little date day out of it. He then asked her if she wanted to go skateboarding with him. She was torn and had tears cause she wanted to do both. We assured her she could. Unfortunately she doesn't get to do both today as they got home at 7:40ish (bedtime is at 8) I know we can just go tomorrow. But at the end of the day I am butthurt that I now have to go put the kids to bed then do my running around at night, and now without my kid who I had planned to take.(a side not: I hate having to go at night and he knows this. Yes the store is less busy but I also have less time. I also super need cat food and the pet store is only open until 9!!!)

Anyways, I'm not sure where to go from here. After typing this out and reading it I can see we clearly don't see eye to eye on some very important stuff. And we definitely need to work some stuff out and talk. As I am finishing this up the bed time problem is currently happening. I am working on putting the baby to bed, the older two need to get ready for bed and read. What is he doing right now? Playing on his computer.(he is gaming with who he just hung out with for 7 hours...I feel like this is important to know)So at the end of they day I will not be making it to the pet store as it is now 8:30 and I still have to read books and tuck in kids. *sigh*
I love the man, but he's driving me bananas and I just want us to make it in the long run....I never know how to talk to him cause every time I do it's like we never had the conversation.. 
Anywho thanks for reading and being my shoulder to cry on ahah. If anyone has any advice on where to go from here, I'd appreciate it greatly! 
Sincerely, mum of 4 trying to find some footing in my life.

Hey, Travel Trotters! üåé As an enthusiastic globetrotter and experimental blogger, I‚Äôve had the privilege of exploring 50 vibrant countries, each with its own unique charm and untold stories. Through this journey, I‚Äôve gathered unforgettable experiences and invaluable tips that will ignite your wanderlust! Let‚Äôs dive into some highlights, insights, and love for the road less taken! üó∫Ô∏è‚ú®

---

**1. The Art of Packing Light üéí**

Traveling through 50 countries has taught me the beauty of minimalist packing. Trust me, your back will thank you! Here are a few hacks to consider:
- **Invest in quality travel gear:** Lightweight and durable backpacks save space and survive the toughest terrains.
- **Mix and match outfits:** Focus on multipurpose clothing that can be layered or dressed up.
- **Essential tech gadgets:** A universal adapter, power bank, and noise-canceling headphones are lifesavers.

**2. Cultivating Cultural Sensitivity ü§ù**

Every destination has its own rhythm, customs, and traditions. Here are ways to embrace the local culture respectfully:
- **Learn a few key phrases:** Simple gestures like greetings or thanks can open many doors.
- **Respect dress codes:** Especially important in culturally conservative areas.
- **Be a mindful guest:** Observe local norms and avoid sensitive topics unless you‚Äôre well-informed.

**3. Unforgettable Adventures & Personal Anecdotes üåÑ**

On my journey, I was awestruck watching the Northern Lights in Iceland and equally charmed by a tiny coffee shop in the alleyways of Kyoto. Each place offers a chance to create memories, so don't hesitate to take the road less traveled:
- **Iceland's Northern Lights:** A surreal dance of colors that leaves you spellbound.
- **Kyoto's hidden cafes:** Cozy, unique, and perfect for journaling your adventures.
- **Safari in Tanzania:** An encounter with wildlife that‚Äôs nothing short of magical.

**4. Budget Travel Made Easy üí∞**

Traveling across 50 countries doesn‚Äôt have to break the bank. Here‚Äôs how to save while maximizing your experiences:
- **Use booking apps wisely:** Explore last-minute deals and off-season travel for cheaper rates.
- **Street food delight:** Experience authentic local cuisine without the heavy price tag.
- **Public transport savvy:** Mastering local transit can be a budget-friendly adventure in itself!

1homzi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1homzi7/the_king_of_crash_nation/,The King of Crash Nation,"Skeep: Hey cringebros and cringebabes‚Äì no intro today, you read the title, you saw the thumbnail, no this isn‚Äôt clickbait. We have a very special guest today who you might recognize. Now, you *might* think I‚Äôm sitting across from Cass ‚ÄúCash‚Äù ‚ÄúCrash‚Äù Bellamy, also known as ‚ÄúThe Keyblade Master of Financial Freedom,‚Äù also known as ‚ÄúKeyblade Karen,‚Äù but you *might* be wrong.¬†¬†

Crash: You would be wrong.¬†

Skeep: I‚Äôve been talking to my guest for awhile already, and I have to say, I‚Äôm *flummoxed.* I‚Äôm not gonna say I believe everything you‚Äôre saying, but I think it‚Äôs worth listening to.

Crash: Listen, if I wasn‚Äôt experiencing this myself, I would think I was insane. I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ honestly still not sure. Logically, I understand that some sort of psychotic break is the most likely explanation for what I‚Äôm‚Äì¬†

Skeep: Before we get to the good stuff, I just wanna thank our sponsor for today, GRIX. GRIX is a beverage subscription service you can trust. Not only do GRIX beverages have anywhere between two to five times the caffeine of standard energy drinks, but every drink is packed with 200 different minerals. Take the standard number of minerals in food and multiply that by a hundred, that‚Äôs how many diverse minerals are in these drinks. Some of these minerals you‚Äôll *only* find in GRIX. Make sure you use a VPN when you sign up for GRIX. GRIX comes in discreet packaging to throw off any prying government eyes at the post office, so don‚Äôt be shy! GRIX: It‚Äôs Too Alpha For The FDA! (*Skeep takes a long drink from a black jug with a fluorescent label*)

Crash: (*Long sigh*)

Skeep: So, why don‚Äôt you introduce yourself?

Crash: Sure. Of course. Hello, everyone, you recognize me as Cassidy Bellamy. But my name is Elizabeth Ann Coen. I‚Äôm from a small town in Illinois, and I‚Äôve been a teacher for the last twenty years. High school, middle, and elementary, but mostly middle school. Three weeks ago, I went to sleep in my own bed, next to my husband, and when I woke up I was Cassidy Bellamy.¬†

Skeep: That must have been a shock. That‚Äôs my personal nightmare, no offense.

Crash: No offense taken, Darren. No personal offense, I mean.¬†

Skeep: You know how crazy that sounds. That‚Äôs the craziest part, guys, I‚Äôm not kidding, he knows‚Äì she‚Äì they‚Äì¬†

Crash: She.

Skeep: *Liz,* can I call you Liz?

Crash: (*Another sigh*) I suppose you can.¬†

Skeep: Liz knows how crazy this sounds, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm trying to say. And that‚Äôs crazy, because *Crash* would never. I mean, the Crash that we all know and love‚Äì or hate‚Äì¬†

Crash: I‚Äôm well aware of Cass Bellamy‚Äôs long history of delusional behavior and compulsive lying. I wish I wasn‚Äôt.¬†

Skeep: Assuming this is true‚Äì and, cringebros and cringebabes, this is just hypothetical‚Äì assuming this is all hypothetically true, had you heard of Crash before you‚Ä¶ became him?

Crash: I actually had. Like I said, I‚Äôm a teacher. You‚Äôd be shocked at some of the things kids are watching online. I always think I‚Äôve heard it all, and then someone drops something like ‚ÄúCashMunnyCoin‚Äù on me, ‚Äúoh, did you hear the Keyblade Karen Meltdown guy is launching a cryptocurrency?‚Äù ‚Äúoh, did you hear the Sora MLM fanfiction guy is going to jail for identity theft?‚Äù I‚Äôd heard the major beats of the story, but I didn‚Äôt realize it was all the same guy until I woke up in Cass Bellamy‚Äôs body.¬†

Skeep: Just hearing those words come out of your mouth is like‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm having an out-of-body experience right now.

Crash: Tell me about it.

Skeep: (*Surprised laughter*)

Crash: I think that if I had woken up as literally anyone else, maybe people would have believed me. Or, at least, maybe *someone* would have believed me.¬†

Skeep: Crash‚Äì Liz‚Äì I *want* to believe you. I really do. Listen, I knew Crash as he was better than, I think, almost anyone except Jimspore and Sorasins, who obviously don‚Äôt count because they‚Äôre assholes. I‚Äôve been following this guy‚Äì you‚Äì for twelve years. Crash does *not* talk the way you‚Äôre talking to me right now. And I‚Äôve never seen Crash dressed that nicely, unless you count cosplay, and even then, his cosplay is shit.¬†

Crash: (*Nodding patiently*) One of the first things I did, once I was in a mental state to do things, was to go to the thrift store and buy some nicer clothes. You know, not the sort of thing I would wear‚Äì but just a few nice, coordinated outfits. At first, I went for the sorts of things I wished my son would wear. Then I realized I was tending to go for androgynizing clothes, and I figured that was probably where I was most comfortable, given the situation. So it‚Äôs been a lot of these turtlenecks, a lot of these cardigans. In this body, I can pull off green very nicely, which was never the case in my real body. It made me look sickly.¬†

Skeep: And you look *good!* I never thought I‚Äôd say this, guys, but Crash looks *good.* It just goes to show what a little effort can do for a guy. Like it can‚Äôt *replace* being toned, but it helps a lot. And, might I say, you actually look a little more toned than usual, too.

Crash: I‚Äôve been going on lots of walks. Cass doesn‚Äôt have a job. So I walk most of the day, now. There are some nice places to walk around Las Vegas, which I never expected.¬†

Skeep: Yeah, the hiking out there‚Äôs pretty amazing, I hear. Hey‚Äì just for contrast, guys, let‚Äôs watch a clip of Crash on our podcast with SlimeTimeJohn last year.

(*The screen cuts to a past recording in a different, smaller studio. Cass Bellamy, dressed in full Sora cosplay, is ranting to two black-clad hosts in matching beanies holding jugs of GRIX*).

*Crash: Why should I pay taxes when I‚Äôm* ***reinvesting in my hustle****? The government is the* ***real*** *pyramid scheme!*¬†

*Skeep: Crash, Crash, Crash, you don‚Äôt pay taxes?! Crash, that‚Äôs a* ***federal crime,*** *you dumb piece of shit.*¬†

*SlimeTimeJohn: You‚Äôre live on camera. Folks, Crash Bellamy just admitted to tax fraud. Someone get the IRS in chat.*

*Crash: I never said that.*

*SlimeTimeJohn: You fucking said it just now!*

*Crash: I pay my taxes! I pay my taxes! I pay my taxes!*¬†

*Skeep: Stop yelling! Stop yelling! Stop yelling! You fucking asshole. Jesus fucking christ.*¬†

*Crash: There are pawns of darkness everywhere. There are pawns of darkness everywhere, and you know it because you are one. You know, you could become a good person if you* ***actually*** *read my books.*

*SlimeTimeJohn: Oh, I‚Äôve read your plagiarized books. They‚Äôre garbage. Blocks of text copy-pasted from Kingdom Hearts fan wikis and generic motivational quotes.*¬†

*Skeep: What‚Äôs in your books that could possibly make anyone a better person? Crash, I think just by talking to you, I become a worse person every day. I used to have hobbies, man, but now it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ finding out what new bullshit Crash is up to and reacting to it.*

*Crash: You‚Äôre just jealous of my entrepreneurial spirit! The spirit of Sora!* ***The spirit of Financial Freedom!***

Skeep: (*Laughing*) That‚Äôs the clip that went viral. I think you‚Äì he‚Äì also said something about how Jeff Bezos wasn‚Äôt spiritually evolved enough to understand Kingdom Hearts?

Crash: I‚Äôll be honest‚Äì I don‚Äôt understand Kingdom Hearts.¬†

Skeep: OHHH!!! Mike, clip that. That‚Äôs gonna go viral. That‚Äôs gonna be everywhere tomorrow.

Crash: I was a little too old for it when it came out, and my kids never really got into it. I‚Äôve done some‚Ä¶ research, in the last few weeks. The plot seems very difficult to follow, though.

Skeep: Well, now we *know* you‚Äôre not the real Crash.¬†

Crash: I wish you meant that.¬†

Skeep: Honestly, hand to god, I do, too. Now, Liz, can you tell us a little more about your life in Illinois?

Crash: Yes. I‚Äôm married, and I have two children. My hometown is sort of a tourist town, but only really for history buffs. I could go into more detail about where I‚Äôm from, but I don‚Äôt want to dox my family, if‚Ä¶ if they still exist. We have a good school district. Nice old brownstone buildings. Lots that survived the Civil War. It‚Äôs a good place to live if you love history, like me. And it‚Äôs beautiful, too. Not like Vegas. Right on a river, lots of green space. I went to college a few towns over and got my Bachelor‚Äôs in Education. I always knew I wanted to teach history. My mom was a museum curator at the‚Ä¶ well, one of the big important historical houses in our town. I‚Äôm considered very good at my job‚Äì I have to be, because if you want to teach history, you want to teach history *there.* It‚Äôs about as competitive as any middle school teacher position could be.¬†

Skeep: Hold on. You said your family might not still exist? What do you mean by that?

Crash: I looked myself up. My social media pages are gone. I can‚Äôt log in to any of my old accounts. I‚Äôm not listed as faculty at the school I was teaching at just three weeks ago. There are women with the same name as me, but none of them have much else in common. For all intents and purposes, I never existed. Elizabeth Ann Coen never existed.

Skeep: But have you tried to look up your husband? Your kids? Your parents?

Crash: I can‚Äôt bring myself to do that.¬†

Skeep: Because you‚Äôre scared they won‚Äôt be there?

Crash: Yes. And because I‚Äôm equally scared that they *will.* Because then, I‚Äôd have to contend with the idea of attempting to contact them. And I don‚Äôt want to subject them to that. I can‚Äôt imagine how scary it would be for my family to have someone like Cass Bellamy‚Äì with his record as a very unstable scam artist‚Äì approach them with all of this personal information claiming to be their wife, mother, or daughter. And it might be even worse if I find out they exist, but I choose *not* to contact them. That‚Äôs too terrible to even think on. And then‚Ä¶ if they are simply *gone‚Ä¶* if they just *never existed‚Ä¶* that‚Äôs more awful than if they were dead.¬†

Skeep: We just got a gift from Spunk Z., thank you Spunk Z! Mods, control the chat‚Äì nobody‚Äôs taking their shirt off in the studio today. Unless? Liz?

Crash: That‚Äôs part of the reason I chose your show. I know that, if they really are out there, they‚Äôll never see this.¬†

Skeep: I take offense to that. But I get it, you raised your kids right. Assuming they‚Äôre real.¬†

Crash: You joke, but yes.¬†

Skeep: No answer to taking your top off?¬†

Crash: I‚Äôm not going to do that.¬†

Skeep: If you‚Äôre telling the truth, they‚Äôre not really *your* nipples.¬†

Crash: That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm not going to do it. I want to give this other person‚Äôs body privacy and respect. As much as I can, anyway.¬†

Skeep: That‚Äôs more than the real Crash would ever say. If you *really* want to respect Crash, you should have come here in a knock-off Sora hoodie with a full-size bag of Takis.¬†

Crash: There‚Äôs give and take.¬†

Skeep: What‚Äôs Crash‚Äôs diet like? Or I guess, what‚Äôs your diet like as Crash? Rumor has it, he only eats hot chips and his shits are bright red. Is that true?

Crash: I eat what I can afford. Right now, that‚Äôs mostly Ramen. It got me through college, so I‚Äôm not unfamiliar with this diet. I‚Äôm smarter about using food pantry programs now, after two decades of living on a public school teacher‚Äôs salary.¬†

Skeep: Right. Because Crash is totally bankrupt and facing a bunch of lawsuits for fraud and shit.

Crash: Which I‚Äôm charmingly reminded of every time I leave his apartment.¬†

Skeep: That must have been an adjustment, getting used to Crash‚Äôs adoring fans.¬†

Crash: I‚Äôd call them stalkers.¬†

Skeep: Some of Crash Nation can go overboard. Better not be any of you cringebros or cringebabes misbehaving! Did you know who you were right away? What was it like, waking up in another person‚Äôs body?

Crash: At first, I thought maybe I‚Äôd broken a bone or pulled muscles or something. There was no pain, but everything about me felt wrong. My legs, too long. My neck, too short. All the weight was in the wrong places, and there was skin in new places, and no skin in other places‚Äì I felt like I was wearing a strange suit, glued to my bones. The reflection in the mirror was a total stranger. I don‚Äôt think I need to explain that it was a nightmare. But discovering the identity of this man‚Äì this human suit I was now trapped in‚Äì was worse.

Skeep: I bet.¬†

Crash: People are constantly trying to approach me. They‚Äôll sit outside of the apartment, they‚Äôll honk their horns to keep me awake, they‚Äôll film me and call me. When I first tried to reach out for help on social media, people messaged me with all kinds of threats and just weird, mean stuff, but the worst ones were the ones who acted like they really wanted to help me, like they believed me. They were the cruelest. I picked up very quickly on the fact that I was living the life of a very, very unpopular person, and a very, very popular target.

Skeep: You mentioned you couldn‚Äôt get into your social media as Liz. But you can get into Crash‚Äôs Twitter and stuff. That‚Äôs very interesting.

Crash: His phone was already logged in to them. It unlocks with facial recognition.¬†

Skeep: At least that‚Äôs convenient.¬†

Crash: At the very very least, it got me in contact with you. I‚Äôm sure you wouldn‚Äôt have taken an interview with someone from a strange new account, coming at you with this premise.

Skeep: Well, you never know. I‚Äôm flattered you chose my show, though. I‚Äôm sure, if you keep this story up, you‚Äôll get real popular with the freak circuit, astral projection and past lives and switching bodies and shit. Glad I got to be first in line to hear it.

Crash: You were one of the only people on earth who would take an interview with Cass Bellamy. And of my limited options, you were the shock jock who had been the most fair to him in the past.¬†

Skeep: ‚ÄúShock Jock?‚Äù I don‚Äôt know if I like that.¬†

Crash: Sorry. It‚Äôs what we called this sort of thing in my day.¬†

Skeep: How old are you, Liz?

Crash: Forty-eight.¬†

Skeep: A tight forty-eight? Or have those years and two kids taken their toll?¬†

Crash: Let‚Äôs move on, Darren.

Skeep: No shame, Liz, we love MILFS on this channel.

Crash: Sure. I‚Äôm a MILF.

Skeep: Mike, clip that. And, Liz, how long is this tenancy going to last, do you think? Is this a temporary thing, or is Crash just gone and Liz here to stay forever?

Crash: I don‚Äôt know. I pray, constantly, that I‚Äôll wake up at home again. I‚Äôll be back with my family. Even if‚Ä¶ well, I‚Äôve imagined that maybe if I‚Äôm here, in Cass‚Äôs body, maybe Cass is in mine, somewhere else. In some other world. The world where Elizabeth Coen exists. You know what terrifies me most about that?

Skeep: The idea that Crash Bellamy is turning your whole life upside-down and probably getting you sent to prison or a mental institution and scaring the shit out of your kids?

Crash: Well, yes, but also, no‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs that in *my* reality, I know I had heard of the Keyblade Karen. I‚Äôd *heard* of Cass Bellamy. I‚Äôd heard of CashMunnyCoin. I think one of my students even dressed up as him, dressing up as that character he likes, Sora, for Halloween. Bellamy existed in my reality, but I don‚Äôt exist *here.* So what does that mean?¬†

Skeep: You want to know what I think?

Crash: I can guess.

Skeep: Okay, go ahead. Guess.

Crash: I‚Äôve thought it, too. Cass Belamy was‚Äì or is‚Äì a profoundly unstable person with delusions of grandeur who is facing multiple legal charges and several lawsuits at the moment. He‚Äôs bankrupt, all of his financial ventures have publicly and spectacularly failed, he owes possibly hundreds of thousands of dollars to MLM companies, he‚Äôs infamous, he‚Äôs endlessly mocked and harassed both online and in real life. His life is hell. Maybe he finally just snapped. Maybe I‚Äôm just something he made up. Another personality that he invented to take over his life and handle his problems so he didn‚Äôt have to be Cass Belamy anymore. The human mind is mysterious and terrifying. Who knows how much it can fabricate? An entire lifetime of memories, even? Knowledge of subjects, skills, possibly learned on some subconscious level, heard about in passing, memorized and kept in some deep mental record of everything we see and hear throughout a day‚Ä¶ Maybe there really is no Elizabeth. Maybe Elizabeth‚Äôs life is just a nice dream. But if it is a dream‚Äì if I *am* a dream‚Äì what happens if Cass Belamy starts to wake up? Where do I go? I‚Äôm terrified that he‚Äôll come back to himself, and I‚Äôll be just‚Ä¶ nonexistant, worse than if I‚Äôd died‚Ä¶ but even more terrified that, perhaps, he‚Äôll just slowly slip back through the cracks in me, and I‚Äôll just‚Ä¶ be him. I‚Äôll just *be* Cass Belamy. His mind, his life, his torment, my consciousness, forever.¬†

Skeep: That‚Äôs not even close to what I was gonna say. I was gonna say I suspect you‚Äôve just been pulling a fast one on us all these years, Crash.¬†

Crash: ‚Ä¶What?

Skeep: I think that the *real* scam *is* Crash Bellamy. You‚Äôve been coming on this show for years, acting all fucked-up, doing crazy stuff, making cringe tiktoks and putting out those godawful e-books, all for attention. You‚Äôve been playing into the lolcow bit for over a decade and now you‚Äôre finally over it, once it stopped being profitable.¬†

Crash: *Why* would anyone do that? No one would do that.¬†

Skeep: Crash Bellamy would, if he had the brains to plan that far ahead. Maybe you didn‚Äôt make money off of it, but you got attention. And in this world, what‚Äôs the difference? Hey‚Äì thank you, Guzzler69! Appreciate the donation. Proves my point.¬†

Crash: Darren. This man is so financially ruined, there‚Äôs no coming back from it. You‚Äôre suggesting that Cass‚Äì that *I* faked being‚Ä¶ what, an anime game fanboy who fell for a bunch of get-rich-quick schemes and then started trying to run his own? You can look up the facts of the lawsuits against him. No one in their right mind would make the financial choices this man did.¬†

Skeep: I‚Äôm not saying you‚Äôre in your right mind. I‚Äôm saying you‚Äôve been smarter than you look since day one. You‚Äôre just tired of the grift.¬†

Crash: I‚Äì (*sighs*) Alright. I understand why you‚Äôd think that. And I understood when I came on this show that there was no chance I‚Äôd ever convince you of the veracity of my experience. It‚Äôs a crazy story. I‚Äôm the definition of an unreliable source.¬†

Skeep: But you came on the show anyway, because, Crash, the one thing that‚Äôs true about you deep down to your core is that you love attention. If you really were someone else‚Äì *anyone* else‚Äì anyone sane, at least‚Äì you‚Äôd stay far away from the spotlight for the rest of your life. If I woke up as Crash Bellamy, I would just drop off the face of the earth. Or worse‚Äì I can‚Äôt say what I‚Äôd do, because it‚Äôs not advertiser-friendly, but let‚Äôs just say no one would ever see Crash Bellamy ever again.¬†

Crash: You know, I watched your show before I came on?

Skeep: I‚Äôd sure hope you did, especially since you‚Äôve been on it.

Crash: This thing you have here, Darren‚Äì it‚Äôs a disturbing little ecosystem. It‚Äôs *exactly* the same bullying that middle school children participate in. *Exactly.*¬†

Skeep: I disagree, but Crash, you‚Äôre on the internet. What do you expect?

Crash: Cass Bellamy‚Äôs original sin was never fraud or identity theft‚Äì it was always the sin of being ‚Äòcringeworthy.‚Äô It was that he was weird. You boys were punishing him for that long before any of this crypto business started. The bad things that Cass has legitimately done were always just excuses‚Äì they made what you were doing feel socially acceptable.¬†

Skeep: No, no, no. See, now I *know* you‚Äôre Crash. Nobody sane thinks that your crypto scam or any of your other scams are excusable just because you‚Äôre mentally ill or whatever you claim.

Crash: I‚Äôm not excusing Bellamy‚Äôs long history of attempting to run scams or stealing credit card information and so on and so on. But I watched your show, Darren. The earliest episodes. And I watched Jimspore and Sorasins and SlimeTimeJim. I‚Äôve seen the way you and people like you chased this man around when he was just some naive eighteen-year-old kid who over-identified with a video game, and whose primary characteristic was his naivety‚Äì willing to believe that anyone offering to make him rich quick was being genuine. I‚Äôve met plenty of children just like Cass Bellamy. Children who should have been getting extra help. Children failed by the system, and failed by their parents. And I‚Äôve met plenty of children just like you, too, Darren. And unfortunately, the Darrens of the world outnumber the Cass Bellamys.¬†

Skeep: *Unfortunately?* You know how I know you‚Äôre full of shit, Crash? Because you haven‚Äôt said *Crash* this whole time. You use his given name. *Everyone* calls him Crash. *No one* calls him Cass. *Everyone* hates him. I think probably even his own parents hate him.¬†

Crash: Sometimes, teaching middle school, it‚Äôs like watching starving piranhas in a tank. They swim around in formation, hunting endlessly, hunting nothing‚Äì until one moves wrong, gets bit, starts to bleed. And once there‚Äôs blood in the water‚Ä¶ they strip their companion‚Äôs bones in seconds. You‚Äôre on the eating side now, Darren, and I‚Äôd say you‚Äôre eating well. But you know your people. Jimspore and Sorasins and SlimeTimeJim. You know all these nice members of the chat, all your donors. You know better than I do that someday, you‚Äôll be the one with their teeth ripping you apart.

Skeep: Wow. What do you think about that, chat? (*A notification appears. Several new donations have come in.*)¬†

Crash: ... You know‚Ä¶¬†

Skeep: What do I know, Crash?

Crash: My favorite bird is the indigo bunting.

Skeep: I did *not* know that.

Crash: Two springs ago, there was a pair of them in the thicket behind my house.

Skeep: Behind *your* house, or ‚ÄòLiz‚Äôs‚Äô house?¬†

Crash: ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not much of a birdwatcher. I‚Äôve got a journal I never use and some binoculars but that‚Äôs it. But there was a day when it was sort of cloudy and I could see them really well from the stoop behind my house. I won‚Äôt call it a porch, just a concrete slab that we have a lawn chair on. I stayed there for almost four hours, just sitting and watching those little birds build their nest. I‚Äôd been putting off grading all afternoon and I was determined to keep putting it off, even if it meant becoming engrossed in the dramas of birds. They came and went. They squabbled with chickadees and squirrels. I realized that one of the birds was missing a foot. A cat got it, maybe. It‚Äôs a miracle it survived as long as it did. And still, it kept building that nest. At the start of the day, there was nothing there but a branch. By the end, there was a little thing like a teacup made of sticks and feathers and hair. My daughter brought me a cup of coffee. That‚Äôs when I realized my feet were so cold, they‚Äôd gone numb. It had been the heat of the coffee that reminded me how cold I felt. And I was overcome with this realization that that‚Äôs what love is, sometimes. Because when I stood up, as I warmed myself, those numb parts started to hurt. I guess, Darren, and Darren‚Äôs chat‚Äì I hope that someday, someone brings you a cup of coffee, and you suddenly feel all the places in you that have gone numb. I hope the hurt is worth the heat. And I hope that I wake up tomorrow at home.

Skeep: Wise words from our resident spiritually enlightened Keyblade Master of Financial Freedom, Crash Bellamy. That‚Äôs our episode today, folks‚Äì any last words, ‚ÄòLiz?‚Äô

Crash: Please‚Äì if you can help me get home, or if you know someone who can help me get home, help me. Spread this around. Make Skeep famous if that‚Äôs what it takes.¬†

Skeep: Shockingly, a sentiment I agree with. Thanks for tuning in, cringebros and cringebabes, and remember‚Äì be nice, wash your ass, and [cringe ](https://www.reddit.com/user/CreepyClothDoll/comments/1gtsj7n/follow_me_on_tumblr/)deeply, my friends.¬†

Some of this is reused from my last post and may seem drastic, but that's cuz it was made in the height of a legitimate time of hazard.

# General Safety & Tips

* **Winter Boots** \* If you have to **regularly walk** to a bus stop or lrt station, I'd highly advise investing in good winter boots. Try to go for **around knee high**, and ensure that they are made of material that will **not soak in water** to the inside. A lot of the time, sidewalks don't get shovelled until you've already walked through them, and the snow builds up high, so get some boots that won't let the snow into your ankles, and that won't freeze your toes off when the snow melts. \* It is more than socially acceptable to be wearing winter boots when you enter buildings, around the university, and anywhere really. If people are judging you for wearing winter boots, they're not worth your time. \* **If you have a locker or established office, etc, bring a plastic bag so you can swap shoes once inside.** just make sure it's not porous material so the snow that melts from your boots doesn't get everything else wet. Alternatively, bring a small towel or cloth to wipe them, but it will only help superficially. \* Have ettiquite though, because floors turn into slip-and-slides when people track in snow, ice, and slush. **Always  swipe, drag, and stomp** your shoes as agressively as needed when you enter a building. Most entrances will have gigantic mats at the doors. Use them. If there is a boot cleaner, even better! Use it as instructed, and you do everyone a favor. \* If you're afraid of slipping on ice, don't wear runners or sneakers or something with mostly flat soles.
* Once it gets **below -20,** these are advised, but for some people, you can manage without when it's above -20.
* **cover your head: toque** (beanie, hat, whatever)**, hood, or earmuffs.**
   * if people are judging your hat head, that is their problem. or if u can, just don't take the hat off! also a great way to hide bed head.
   * I personally find earmuffs aren't warm enough (note for people with short haircuts like undercuts, pixies, fringe, etc. anything with the sides or back mostly exposed.)
   * **You don't need to stop at just one.** Put ur toque on, flip up your hoodie, put ur jacket hood on top, and hell put earmuffs or headphones with nothing playing on top.
* **Hand protection or say goodbye to your fingers.**
   * **your hands are extremely susceptible to frost bite** and that's not good considering we use our fingers a lot. **take the minute of inconvenience it takes to get your gloves or mits out** rather than risk **permanent damage** on your fingers.
   * **caution that some mittens have wide enough threading to let a large amount of cold air in and are not adequate protection.** check that mits have at least one solid layer of protection or double up with 2 pairs.
      * make sure you know if your gloves or mits are water resistant. just helps in case you need to touch something with snow on it so you can prepare and bring a second pair of gloves to switch into once your first pair is cold with melted snow.
   * fingerless gloves are better than nothing, but will leave your fingertips vulnerable. if you really need to use ur phone outside, there are options for gloves that have tips that will work on touchscreens
   * On top of colds and sicknesses getting easily passed around the unviersity durring colder months, **masking** will also keep your face warm while offering a level of protection from germs. Specifically cloth masks will keep your nose from running in the cold.
      * When it gets severely cold (-30), A cloth or medical face mask will keep your nose and mouth warm while protecting you from breathing the frigid cold air
   * a warm **scarf** could also help with this, but it can be hard to wear a scarf when also wearing a hood sometimes.
* Get some **hand warmers for your pockets!**
   * The brand I see most often is called Little Hotties, but I'm sure other brands work just as well.
   * just follow the directions on the packet (usually to squeeze and shake the packet) to get it to start releasing heat and put it in your pockets or gloves to hold on to.
   * they can be bought basically everywhere (grocery stores, dollarama, drug stores, probably Submart) including other alternatives like rechargeable or microwaveable ones on amazon
* **Dress in layers. MANY LAYERS.**
   * Your jacket alone will not protect you enough from the cold if you're wearing just a normal fit unless your jacket is as expensive as a standard uofa course fee :)
   * you can still dress cute and shit while dressing in layers! here are some ideas for what to layer under various clothing items
      * **baggy pants** (jeans, cargos, sweatpants): leggings, bike shorts, yoga pants, capris. if baggy pants aren't your thing, you can still go for doubling up leggings, or leggings under capris, etc.
      * **t-shirt**: tank top (or multiple), longsleeves, sweatshirts, hoodies, bodysuits, dress shirts. hell, even ANOTHER t-shirt.
      * **hoodie**: literally anything. you can fit so much under a hoodie. my high score is a tank top, a tshirt, and 2 longsleeves under 1 hoodie. **a flannel, bomber jacket, or varsity jacket could also go overtop of a hoodie.**
      * **crop top**: literally anything, just please do NOT be wearing a crop top with nothing underneath unless your jacket is top tier and long enough to keep you warm. bodysuits are great options for under form fitting crop tops, but long sleeves work just as well and u can tuck it in to your pants if you want.
* If you're staying at **home** or in **residence** somewhere and **you're still cold inside**:
   * **cover your windows** with curtains, a blackout, or a thermal insulating layer. the simplified physics is basically that when we have only a few layers of glass between us and outside, a significant amount of heat is lost through that window no matter how tightly sealed it is due to the contrast in our room's temperature and outside temperatuer. so adding insulating layers between the room and the window can help a lot with keeping your room warm. [Here's a more detailed video on the topic](https://youtu.be/A0hJ5D8UAqU?si=WntKQ0TTL6re1bFC).
      * this may affect some people's mental health due to less daylight during the winter, but especially if you needto conserve heat by covering windows. if this is the case, consider investing in a SAD light therapy lamp
   * invest in a good **space heater.** i'll caution everyone who loves temu and cheap amazon finds that a heater is not something you want to cheap out on. poorly made (cheap) heaters can be a fire and electrical hazard, so if you don't want to melt your electrical sockets, go for a midpriced one.
   * find **heating pads** that wrap around the body and **put them under** hoodies or jackets while you sit at your desk. insulation is key.
   * of course, try to cook hot meals if you're in a space with a kitchen. and i mean more than microwaved meals.
   * if it works for you, have something spicy to eat or drink

# Campus Specific Tips

**Quickest Routes minimizing outdoor travell, and** [pedway routes](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/youalberta/2024/03/pedways-101-a-guide-to-using-campus-pedways.html)

* Pedway route: SUB -> Agriculture & Forestry -> General Services -> NREF -> ETLC -> MEC E or DICE
   * Sub 2nd Floor, go up the stairs near SubPHOTO and turn left towards Dinwoodie Lounge. Walk around the corner and through the pedway.
   * You come out at the 2nd floor of Agriculture and Forestry (AgFor) right beside the atrium. you can enter directly into the atrium with the spiral staircase, or go down the stairs just ahead. Using those stairs, turn to the right and continue into General Services (GS)
   * Turn right once in general services, and take the stairs up
   * Continue past the lockers in NREF (NRE) aka the Natural Resources Engineering Facility. and walk towards the bobsled with a skeleton in it.
   * Through the pedway is ETLC (Engineering Teaching & Learning Complex). Turn right before the Tim Hortons, and walk past the Elko Garage on the left hand side of the stairs. Turn left into the pedway with the vending machines..
   * Now you're in MEC E (Mechanical Engineering). Continue down the hallway until you can turn right into the garage, and walk through it all until you find a staircase on your right. Descending the staircase brings you to the end of the pedway route, and a door fairly close to the main west entrance of CCIS.
* CCIS connections:
   * Earth Science Building (ESB) pedway can be accessed at the Eastern elevators of CCIS on the 2nd floor.
   * L1 Biosci hallway: Access the locker hallway on L1 CCIS either by going through the doors near the desks at the eastern side of L1, or by taking the North West elevator down to L1, or by exiting the central L1 lecture halls at the front of the halls. There is a hallway on the northern wall that connects straight to the microbiology classrooms below remedy, which also connects to the exits of the CCIS 1-440 and 1-430 lecture halls
   * CCIS connects to CAB along **2 routes:**
      * Most everyone knows that you can enter the South Academic Building (SAB), walk into the Central Academic Building (CAB), and then continue down the Chem East Hallway directly into eastern CCIS near the science student services office on the main floor.
      * If you take the other route into the Chem West wing (ochem. it's all white for some reason), and continue straight through until you hit doors, you can descend those stairs by 1 flight, and exit the staircase. On the right is a door into L1 CCIS directly near the Physics Drop boxes and the learning commons area.
* Health science pedways:
   * the 2nd? 3rd? Level of education south connects via pedway with -> HMRC (Heritage Medical Research Centre which connects through some hallways directly into -> Katz Group Center. You can also stay in HMRC a little longer or cut through 2nd floor of Katz to -> Medical Sciences which connects via pedway with the Northern end of -> ECHA. this of course has a pedway into the -> UofA Hospital.
* Law & Arts pedways: i'll be honest i've never ventured this south of campus cuz law students scare me. just follow the [article](https://www.ualberta.ca/en/youalberta/2024/03/pedways-101-a-guide-to-using-campus-pedways.html)

**Warm Study Spots:**

* **Cameron and Rutherford Library** are both boiling 24/7 as usual. Here's are the [library hours](https://www.library.ualberta.ca/hours-locations). The earliest any will open on a weekday is 8am sadly (plz just give me one hour earlier).
   * On most floors in Cameron, the heaters are all lining the walls excluding the basement. Though, sometimes the basement feels a bit like a sauna.
* **VVC West Pool Bleachers.** This was suggested by someone on my last post, so I can't say much about it other than it sounds about right. Most of the time, the lower levels of VVC feel very warm due to the locker rooms and pools.
* **Sub Couches at the Fire Pit** if you can block out the bussling noise and activity that's always happening in SUB.
   * SUB gets a lot of direct sunlight through the windows in the afternoon and midday, which if you're willing to stick around will get you nice and toasty.
   * the beanbag staircase is great for sunlight if you get the right time, but it constantly is chilled by the gusts of wind that come through the doors, so it's not an ideal place for warmth.
* [**Carruthers Student Commons**](https://www.ualberta.ca/business/student-services/carruthers-student-commons.html) **(Business).** This (hidden? maybe just to me.) gem is very cozy and gets some nice sunlight in the mornings and during the day. There's not too much seating, but still worth it to me, especially if you gotta be around Tory and business
* **Agriculture & Forestry Building.** the rave is always about the atrium, which does indeed get a lot of great sunlight, but AF has some really cozy study spaces other than the atrium if you can escape the wind from doors openning.
   * Tip: AF building can be reached through pedways in SUB and GSB
   * [pedways map](https://medium.com/youalberta/ped-101-an-introduction-to-campus-pedways-d2ba575d2b25)
* **CCIS upper floors**  if you're lucky enough to get a spot. The natural light from the quad windows as well as the reflective lighting from mirrors at the top of the main area can be nice if u manage to get far enough from the doors

**Hot Meals**

* **Microwaves** are abundant and yet so scarce all around campus. Here are some that I know are still functional:
   * CCIS at the ISSS office (level 1 main area near the dinosaur) has microwaves open for use during regular hours
   * [Carruthers Student Commons](https://www.ualberta.ca/business/student-services/carruthers-student-commons.html) in the Business building
   * SUB food court (always remember that there are more microwaves near the subway that typically won't have as long of a lineup during busy hours!)
   * ETLC (near tim hortons)
   * ECHA.... somewhere i don't remember. kind of everywhere.
   * AgFor near the atrium
* Remedy, Starbucks, Second Cup, Tim's, and The Daily Grind (anywhere that sells coffee) **WILL NOT charge you for hot water if you bring your own cup** or something to put it in.
   * You can get a cup of hot water (if you didn't bring your own cup) for less than a dollar (typically 30-50 cents) at all these places.
   * Submart also has a kettle free for use, but it's only out sometimes.
   * **Bring a mug and some tea bags, hot chocolate mix, or whatever** you want! You can ask for stir sticks too and if you're at CAB Remedy or Daily Grind they have cream and sugar out too for use.
   * most club rooms will also have a kettle for use
* **Instant noodles or soup broth mix are a great way to take advantage of the hot water you can get around campus**
   * **a hot meal** is really nice when it's cold out, and you don't have to bring a heavy thermos if you bring cup noodles or those little kraft dinner cups
      * you can also buy travel ramen bowls online if you're an instant ramen lover. simply pack the noodles in the container, then separately bring any veggies, spices, or flavour packets u wanna add. ask for hot water to be added and then close it up to let the noodles cook.
* **Hit the gym in VVC and have a nice warm shower.**
* Idk about the mens and womens locker rooms and their shower situations, but the universal change rooms have locked private showers which can get impressively warm.
   * u don't even need to go work out to use the showers and locker rooms. If you're on campus for the day and feeling chilled, go take a shower if u want. You'll need to bring your own shampoo, soap, etc, and I'm unsure if a full body towel will be loaned, but there are really good quickdry towels online you can buy for convenience.",28,1735441736.0,uAlberta,5,1.0,False
1homnj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/snowmobiling/comments/1homnj2/went_to_look_at_one_of_the_leds_a_guy_was_selling/,Went to look at one of the LEDs a guy was selling today and ended up buying everything he had. ,"Title should say sleds not LEDS, apparently I can‚Äôt spell.

So I have been looking for a second sled to add to my 2007 M1000 Sno Pro. Something my brother, dad, wife or whatever can ride, or that I can ride during times where a piped 175hp 153x2.5 isn‚Äôt ideal. Saw an add last night where a guy was selling both his sleds because his kids moved away and his wife doesn‚Äôt like sledding. Both very clean Yamahas, a 2002 SX Viper 121‚Äù with pipe and can, and a 2003 RX1 with a Hartman skid and tunnel extension and Ohlins adjustable rear shock upgrade. The RX1 also has electric start and reverse. 4000 miles on the viper, 5000 miles on the RX1. Both have newer 1‚Äù Ripsaw tracks. His prices were very reasonable for our area. Called him 10 minutes after he posted and he said he would hold them till I got there today to see them and decide what I wanted. 

I went today and rode both, and they are very different animals, but I really didn‚Äôt know which would compliment my other sled or which I liked better. Anyway, when I got there he had them on a 2014 14 foot aluminum trailer with the fold down ‚Äúdrive off‚Äù front panels. I told him I didn‚Äôt know which I liked better and asked if I could go grab a coffee, think, and come back in 20 minutes. He made a joke about having to buy both if I couldn‚Äôt decide. When I came back, I asked him seriously if he would sell both, AND the trailer for a package deal and he said he would and to make him an offer because he had a price in mind as a package already. I think he may have been expecting that I would ask. I tossed out my offer and ended up buying both sleds and the 14‚Äô aluminum drive on drive off trailer for $4000 USD. I‚Äôm not sure yet if I will keep both sleds, or ride them for a while and sell the one I don‚Äôt like as much. Honestly growing up on big triples and now wrestling a 153‚Äù 1000, the weight of the RX1 did really bother me at all for the time I rode it since it will mainly be fields, trails and lakes with not hill climbing or deep powder.

I‚Äôm not being rude, but you can‚Äôt call yourself a master chef when your dishes are always effing burnt. So around a week or two ago H√§nsel (my assistant? Pet? Henchman? TBD) and I were trying to make a disaster meal better that Mutt ruined. He put chicken pot pie in a popsicle form to serve and we were trying to melt the popsicles to like- actual food. I finally lost it and told Mutt; ‚ÄúWow Mutt, have you considered you aren‚Äôt really good at this?‚Äù H√§nsel told me to chill but the world needed the truth. This got Mutt mad.

Later that day Mutt attempted- and yes I mean attempted- to cook pasta EXCEPT he forgot to boil the water. He dumped the whole bag of pasta into a pot, and just‚Ä¶ stood there. I finally had enough and kicked him in the balls. Apparently Mutt took my constructive criticism as an offense. I was just doing him a favour by pointing out his stupid flaws. 

Cut to dinner that night (Mutt is my boss‚Äôs (F35) husband and all four of us live in the same house) my boss told him to make dinner. He ‚Äòdid‚Äô. A stew, and at first me and brother dearest thought it was going to be normalcy, praying he had added seasoning, but it was NOT‚Ä¶

H√§nsel took the first bite, and his face twisted into that like he just devoured pure poison. Turns out, Mutt grabbed every leftover ingredient from the kitchen and dumped it into one pot with some chicken and vegetable stock. There was fish, garlic, raw potato chunks, coffee grounds, peas, raw meatballs, raisins, cheese chunks, mints, and I swear to god grape jelly. I didn‚Äôt even eat it because H√§nsel being the sacrificial idiot he is pushed me out of my seat onto my rump and ate his entire bowl and half of my bowl stared at me with teary eyes saying; ‚ÄòGretel I don‚Äôt think I can feel my taste buds anymore‚Äô

Now, H√§nsel isn‚Äôt talking out loud and only through writing or texting, Mutt is smug because he got ‚Äôback‚Äô at me‚Ä¶

","

The first light of dawn painted the horizon in soft hues of orange and pink, casting long shadows across the sprawling military base nestled in the Ukrainian countryside. The crisp morning air carried the scent of damp earth and diesel, mingling with the faint aroma of coffee brewing in tin mugs.

Soldiers moved about the camp, each immersed in their routines. On one side of the clearing, a group of men and women jogged in formation, their boots pounding against the gravel in rhythm. Closer to the main gates, a pair of sentries stood stoically, rifles slung over their shoulders, their eyes scanning the landscape for any sign of movement beyond the wire fence.

Inside the barracks, I sat on a wooden crate near the edge of the training grounds, carefully disassembling my rifle. The familiar motions were soothing, but my mind raced. Rumors had been circulating since dawn‚Äîwhispers of a surprise assault on a hidden enemy headquarters nestled deep between the trees of a nearby city. The mission, they said, was imminent.

I wiped the bolt clean with an oily rag, my fingers moving automatically as my thoughts spiraled. If the rumors were true, it wouldn‚Äôt be long before we were called to action. Across the clearing, I could see others preparing in their own ways‚Äîtightening straps, checking ammunition, and exchanging quiet words. The air felt heavy with anticipation.

The sharp, shrill tone of the alarm cut through the camp, silencing the hum of conversation. Within moments, our team was assembled: eleven heavily armed soldiers standing shoulder to shoulder in a tight line near the main staging area.

Our team leader, Captain Anatoly, stood in front of us, barking orders. ‚ÄúThis is it, men. HQ confirmed the intel. Enemy HQ between the trees, just outside the city. We move in, neutralize the threat, and secure the area before reinforcements arrive. Routine mission. Fast and clean. Air support is on standby.‚Äù

Fast and clean, I thought, exchanging a glance with Ivan, my closest friend and squadmate. His lips were pressed into a thin line, his fingers twitching slightly as they gripped his rifle. Like me, he didn‚Äôt buy the captain‚Äôs assurances. We knew better. The enemy wasn‚Äôt stupid. If they‚Äôd set up a headquarters there, it was fortified. Maybe booby traps. Maybe an ambush. Maybe worse.

The others seemed unfazed. The medics checked their packs, the engineers adjusted their demolition charges, and the heavy AT specialists stood like statues, their launchers slung over their shoulders. They trusted the plan, trusted Anatoly. I envied their confidence.

‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just about us,‚Äù Anatoly continued. ‚ÄúThis is about pushing the line. The intel is solid. Stick to the plan, watch each other‚Äôs backs, and we‚Äôll be back here before dinner.‚Äù

Ivan leaned close, muttering under his breath. ‚ÄúLight resistance, he says. Next thing you know, we‚Äôll be walking into a hornet‚Äôs nest.‚Äù

I nodded, slinging my rifle over my shoulder. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not just clearing a building. We‚Äôre walking into their backyard.‚Äù

As the team filed toward the waiting transport vehicles, the weight of the mission settled in my chest. Routine mission. That‚Äôs what Anatoly called it. Just some shooting, some air support, and we‚Äôd clean up the rest.

But Ivan and I knew better. There was no such thing as routine. Not here. Not today.

I can't help wonder what if iisang tao lang yung ""nagkulang"" and ""bumitaw"". 

Hi, I'm SM (20M) and yesh I'm young. This year was really not for me kasi puno ng heartbreaks, betrayal and lies. I had my very first boyfriend last year and we broke up nong January. He broke up with me for reasons na I know were shallow and di niya sinasabi sakin yung real reasons niya. I found out naman ano yon pero its not the point of this story. 

Our relationship started out great, as friends. Slowly nagkadevelopan nalang and we started to date. As unang relationship ko to I tried my best gave all my efforts to the point na I was compromising my studies para sa kanya. He was coffee and I was tea kumbaga, but slowly nagiging coffee nadin ako just to show na I was giving my efforts. He was like a child, di marunong sa gawaing bahay, too irresponsible, walang kusa. Kaya I was not just the partner, naging parent din ako. Ako tiga linis, luto, tiga ayos and mind you same pa kaming students neto but I'm doing a lot for the relationship. I'm doing it all kasi gusto ko, kasi partner ko sya and I loved him. 

But throughout our relationship sobrang nagkulang siya, and I'm not just saying this kasi mataas expectation ko for a relationship pero it's because I know I'm not receiving kahit yung bare minimum. Yet I stayed kahit sobrang drained nako sa araw-araw because I was hoping for a change. I am open naman with my feelings na nafufrustrate na ako pero I always ends up with ""yan ka na naman"", ""oh tapos?"" or just avoids me all in all. Sobrang nakakapagod yung nasa relationship kayo pero ikaw lang yung gumagalaw, yung tinitiis mo yung pagkukulang.

Then one day, he told me na he wanted space, binigay ko but I knew deep inside na ayaw niya na. I can't lose him yet sabi ko sa sarili ko since may attachment issues ako, kaya I begged for 3 weeks. Pag dating sa dulo nong 3 weeks na yon I gave up. I stopped begging. Tapos kinausap niya ako, stop na daw kami, friends nalang daw (gago). Bumitaw siya. I agreed kasi pagod nadin ako magbeg pero ba't siya yung bumitaw e ako yung napagod? 

Kaya whenever nakakadaan ako ng video or posts about ""sino may kasalanan, yung nagkulang o yung bumitaw?"", I keep asking myself, ""siya yung nagkulang, siya yung bumitaw, pero ba't ako yung nasaksaktan?"" 



(Pumayag ako maging friends kami kaya nalaman ko yung real reason niya pero di niya alam na alam ko, currently I'm moving forward naman, siguro try again nalang ako next year tuloy ang buhay!)",0,1735440679.0,phlgbt,0,0.33,False

My coffee beans were recently delivered by Atlas Coffee Club (dark roast).

Here is my workflow:

1. Weigh/grind 18 grams of coffee beans
2. WDT tool to break up clumps
3. Bang the portafilter on the counter to even out the coffee
4. Use a coffee distributer/leveler to even everything out
5. Tamp

I see massive improvement compared to when I first started, but here are a few observations:

1. I see multiple streams at first, is it okay that  it starts this way before they converge into one?
2. Trying to adjust the volume for my shots is finicky. I manually set the volume to target about 36g, but   I get a lot more volume. In this particular video I got about 55g in 42seconds. Is it possible that I set this volume when I was grinding too fine, so there is more volume now?

Should the programmed volume be re-adjusted once everything has been dialed in?

Looking forward to feedback/criticism!

[EN]

Former owners of a coffee plantation, the Bielle family was at the head of a prosperous coffee company which employed 32 farmers in 1967. Jean Pierre Bielle, health officer at the time, with Valentine Lacave, his wife, and their 4 children . One of the sons, Nicolas Bielle, created a sugar factory with his brother Maximilien after the death of their father. Following the death of Nicolas Bielle, the family was forced to transfer the property to Messrs Espanet et Cie in 1857. The company was dissolved in 1868 and the Espanet heirs inherited a 52 hectare property made up of a main house, a windmill, a sugar factory, 17 farmers' huts and a 14 hectare sugar cane plantation. Fernand Espanet will get into debt until he can no longer get out of it and will in turn transfer the property to Ernest Bourjac in 1882, to neutralize his debts.



The¬†Bielle distillery was founded towards the end of the 19th century and it was only in 1910 that the Bielle distillery began to produce rum in the heart of a territory where sugar cane cultivation predominated. The perpetual evolution of the estate through changes of owners led to the founding of the Bielle distillery and allowed the distillery to acquire a solid reputation in the market for quality agricultural rum. Working with high-quality sugar cane with the true tradition of producing agricultural rum allows the Bielle rum brand to preserve the quality of its products. It was therefore in Marie Galante, also called the island of 100 mills or the island of Canne, that the Bielle distillery was created in the 1910s and the tradition of manufacturing agricultural rum from this era continues to this day.


In 2016, the Bielle distillery innovated in a new process which consit in¬†aging rum on a moving sailboat¬†in a saline environment, tossed by the swell without rest for a vintage of undeniable singularity. The first barrels of rum therefore crossed the sea on the¬†Tres Hombres¬†in order to make dynamik rum. This adventure was born from the authenticity of the Tres Hombres idea of ‚Äã‚Äãreactivating the maritime transport of goods by sail for ecological transport. This is how this brick-schooner crosses the oceans with quality products on board such as coffee from Colombia, cocoa from the Dominican Republic or Rum Bielle from Marie-Galante.


„ÄäOn June 19, 2020, the Schooner Bielle Marie-Galante left its home port with 1,590 liters of rum in its belly (62 barrels) to reach Marseille with the plan to follow in the wake of Ulysses and wear the colors of his rum and Marie-Galante. The crew had set off joyfully for this distant race, but on this moonless night, harsh and sad, the beautiful bird was shattered in mid-flight. Fortunately, the crew members were able to safely get on the reef while the sea regurgitated the barrels and scattered the wreckage of the ship into the waves. The fate of our beautiful schooner joining this magnificent odyssey came to an abrupt end. I had traced my will along the path of stars to join this magnificent odyssey but the sea in its sorrowful jealousy took revenge on the love I had for this project.„Äã

Ancienne propri√©taire de plantation de caf√©, la famille Bielle √©tait √† la t√™te d‚Äôune prosp√®re cafeti√®re qui faisait travailler 32 cultivateurs en 1967. Jean Pierre Bielle, officier de sant√© √† l‚Äô√©poque, avec Valentine Lacave, son √©pouse, et leurs 4 enfants. Un des fils, Nicolas Bielle, cr√©e une sucrerie avec son fr√®re Maximilien apr√®s le d√©c√®s de leur p√®re. Suite au d√©c√®s de Nicolas Bielle, le famille est contrainte de c√©der √† Messieurs Espanet et Cie la propri√©t√© en 1857. La soci√©t√© sera dissoute en 1868 et les h√©ritiers Espanet h√©ritent d‚Äôune propri√©t√© de 52 hectares compos√©e d‚Äôune maison principale, d‚Äôun moulin √† vent, d‚Äôune sucrerie, de 17 cases de cultivateurs et d‚Äôune plantation de canne √† sucre de 14 hectares. Fernand Espanet va s‚Äôendetter jusqu‚Äô√† ne plus s‚Äôen sortir et va c√©der √† son tour la propri√©t√© √† Ernest Bourjac en 1882, pour neutraliser ses dettes.


La¬†distillerie Bielle¬†a √©t√© fond√©e vers la fin du XIX√® si√®cle et c‚Äôest seulement en 1910 que la distillerie Bielle va commencer √† produire du rhum au c≈ìur d‚Äôun territoire o√π pr√©domine la culture de la canne √† sucre. L‚Äô√©volution perp√©tuelle du domaine au fil des changements de propri√©taires a men√© √† la fondation de la distillerie Bielle et a permis √† la distillerie d'acqu√©rir une r√©putation solide dans le march√© des rhum agricole de qualit√©. Le travail de la canne √† sucre de haute qualit√© avec la v√©ritable tradition d'√©laboration de rhum agricole permet √† la marque¬†rhum Bielle¬†de pr√©server la qualit√© de ses produits. C‚Äôest donc √† Marie Galante, appel√© √©galement l‚Äô√Æle des 100 moulins ou encore l‚Äô√Æle de la Canne que la distillerie Bielle a vu le jour dans les ann√©es 1910 et la tradition de fabrication du rhum agricole de cette √©poque perdure jusqu‚Äô√† ce jour.

En 2016, la distillerie Bielle innove dans un nouveau proc√©d√© qui est celui du¬†vieillissement du rhum sur un voilier en mouvement¬†dans un environnement salin, ballot√© par la houle sans repos pour une cuv√©e √† la singularit√© ind√©niable. Les premiers f√ªts de rhum ont donc fait leur travers√©e sur le¬†Tres Hombres¬†afin de faire du rhum dynamik

Cette aventure est n√©e de l‚Äôauthenticit√© de l‚Äôid√©e du Tr√®s Hombres de r√©activer le transport maritime de marchandises √† la voile pour un transport √©cologique. C‚Äôest ainsi que ce brick-go√©lette traverse les oc√©ans avec √† son bord des produits de qualit√© tels le caf√© de Colombie, le cacao de la R√©publique Dominicaine ou le Rhum Bielle de Marie-Galante.

Le 19 juin 2020, la Go√©lette Bielle Marie-Galante quittait son port d‚Äôattache avec 1590 litres de rhum dans le ventre (62 tonnelets) pour rejoindre Marseille avec le projet d‚Äôaller dans le sillage d‚ÄôUlysse porter les couleurs de son rhum et de Marie-Galante.
L‚Äô√©quipage √©tait parti joyeux pour cette course lointaine, mais par cette nuit sans lune, dure et triste fortune, le bel oiseau s‚Äôest fracass√© en plein vol.
Fort heureusement, l‚Äô√©cueil hospitalier a r√©cup√©r√© l‚Äô√©quipage sain et sauf pendant que la mer r√©gurgitait les tonnelets et dispersait dans les flots les d√©bris du navire. Le destin de notre belle go√©lette rejoignant cette magnifique odyss√©e s‚Äôest arr√™t√© tout net.
J‚Äôavais trac√© ma volont√© en chemin d‚Äô√©toiles pour rejoindre cette magnifique odyss√©e mais la mer dans sa jalousie chagrine s‚Äôest veng√©e de l‚Äôamour que j‚Äôavais pour ce projet.„Äã

I called you the next day and you said you pissed your bed.  I consoled you and said that happens sometimes.  You said, ‚ÄúNo.  You don‚Äôt understand.  I watched myself piss on myself.‚Äù  I never saw you again.  Hope you‚Äôre doing well and the beer fridge you loaned me for my office kicked the bucket about 10 years ago.  Take care Hoop.

I was new to the world of pour over when I got it, so I‚Äôm not ruling out that it could be an issue with myself or my recipe. But I feel like I‚Äôve tried tweaking everything and I just can‚Äôt get an excellent cup of coffee. I‚Äôm usually left with a good cup of coffee that has some harshness/bitterness/astringency I dk, until I grind so course that it becomes too watery.

For reference my usual starting point is 7.5 grind size, 203f 50/50 dilution TWW ‚Äúlight‚Äù water, 2~3x bloom for 1 minute then a single pour up to 1:16 with or without a swirl at the end. As I said I‚Äôve tried changing every variable here besides the grinder and this is what typically works the best to my taste but for different coffees I‚Äôve settled on slightly different variations of this.

So is there anyone else who feels the 078 doesn‚Äôt live up to the hype? Did you find a grinder you liked better? I‚Äôm wondering if I need to bite the bullet and buy an ek43 to truly be satisfied but I‚Äôve heard those aren‚Äôt the best for in home use.

1holwgf,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1holwgf/did_anybody_else_kinda_semiforget_that_mormons/,Did anybody else kinda semi-forget that Mormons are Christians while growing up?,"To add a little context to this, I am a 40 year old man who was born and raised as a TBM in southern Utah.  This is what I remember of my church education as a kid:  

Lots of trivial nonsense about Joseph Smith.  Did you know Joseph Smith was a stick pull champion?  Joseph Smith was 6 ft tall, 200 pounds and very athletic and strong!  One time as a child, Joseph Smith had to have his leg operated on and he was offered some whiskey as an anesthetic which he refused because gosh darnit, Joseph was just so humble and pure even though the word of wisdom, nor any other part of the restored gospel had been revealed at this time.  

  
Aside from Joseph we also were taught plenty about our pioneer ancestors.  Numerous random faith-promoting stories about the pioneers crossing the plains and their trying early days once they had arrived in Zion.  Oh, and you better believe we heard a lot about how the saints were So PeRsEcUtEd during their early days in the Midwest and were constantly being ran out of town because they had the truth and Satan had control over their enemies.

  
There was also ample discussion about rules.  Rules, rules, rules.  Oh...and did I mention rules?  No sleeveless shirts, no short shorts, no showing legs, midriffs or shoulders.  Don't date until 16 and even then you should only go on group dates.  No rated R movies and sometimes even PG-13 movies were discouraged.  No cussing or inappropriate jokes.  No porn.  Don't hang out with the bad kids.  Absolutely 100 percent do not do anything even remotely fun or enjoyable on Sunday.  Girl's swimsuits should always be one piece.  Stay away from parties where Gospel standards are not being met.  Avoid even the very appearance of evil! Only one set of ear piercings for girls, no piercings at all for boys, no tattoos, only conservative clothing and hairstyles.  No coffee, tobacco, tea, alcohol, or drugs.  Caffeinated sodas were still kind of a grey area.  No necking or petting (terms that were so outdated I had no idea what the fuck they were), no masturbation or porn.  Sexual sins are next to murder in seriousness.  ALL sexual sins must be confessed to the Bishop.  If boys don't want to go on a mission, tough shit you are going on a mission.  Girls, you are excused.  Just hurry up and get married and start making babies.  Read your scriptures daily.  Never get into any of that ""anti-mormon"" material.  It will allow Satan to take hold of you and deceive you.  Seek out information from approved sources only.  Never disobey or question church doctrines or your church leaders.

  
There were a ton of quotes from the prophets and apostles.  Mostly the ones from the 1950s up to the current crop.  Ol' Gordon B. Stinky was the head honcho through most of my youth so he got a lot of air time.  Seems like we heard mostly from the one's from the 1950s up to the current crop of prophets and apostles at that time, and even some up to our current time.  Some of the old gasbags that really stand out in my memory as being quoted a lot are Boyd K. Packer \*wretching sounds\*, Spencer W. Kimball, David O. McKay, Bruce R. McConkie, Tommy Monson, Eyring, Ballard, L. Tom Petty, and Extra Daft Benson.

All in all the focus was very much on a white washed version of the early history of the saints, a laundry list of Mormon specific rules,  the philosophies of (the aforementioned) men, mingled with scripture.  A lot of focus on just an unwritten Mormon culture that would pervade your upbringing if you grew up Mormon around that time.  When I entered the MTC prior to serving my mission in Iowa in 2004 I had a bit of a mindfuck.  We were going over the lessons that we would teach the investigators and it was all, ""Jesus Christ this, Savior that, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.""  I remember having this thought pass through my mind that was more or less like, ""oh yeah, we are a Christian church that claims to follow the restored church of Jesus.""   Don't get me wrong, I know that a restoration of Christ's church, and a purported directive to follow Christ have always been taught in the Mormon church.  It didn't seem like a huge central focus to me though.  At least not to the youth.  I felt like we were taught to follow men, more than Jesus.  It just seemed so much to me like our focus was on pioneers, Mormon culture, Mormon prophets, Mormon rules.  Mormon shit, not Jesus shit.  Actually discussing Jesus felt so foreign to me.",4,1735439201.0,exmormon,3,0.75,False

I had none, my ex wife had a good chunk. We did our own separation agreement, later filed by her. I tried to be the good guy, and in the agreement, it was stated that her RRSP's was hers and I would not file a claim and I didn't want any of it.. However, if she ever came after me for additional money for any reason, I would go after her RRSP's. This was 2007. I was to pay $350 a month in child support, based on my income at the time. I was laid off 2 years later and for a very long time, could not find a job to resume my career. We had an agreement to drop the support to $200 until my income recovered, as I was only receiving EI. Fall 2010, my career resumed and I resumed the $350. A few months later, I get a hostile letter from the Family Responsibility Office, with threats of garnishing my pay, seizing my accounts and passport, etc. What the fuck? That's how they tell you a case has been filed. Eventually, they told me she not only wanted the back support payments, but padded additional bogus expenses (all denied). I faxed 65 pages of receipts and the $200 agreement. They said they didn't care, and ordered me to pay about $2000. No big deal. My case worker at the FRO was on my side, as she saw these bullshit claims all the time. She said I could pay it back over 18 months if I wanted to. I agreed. Made my ex furious, as she simply wanted quick cash to go to Cuba. (Overheard by my son and relayed to me).

I let it go again. Now, 14 years later, she has been remarried 6 years, me remarried 2 years. I was thinking of our agreement. She broke it filing that bogus claim. She had also lied to her employer the year before in 2008 and got herself fired from a prestigious and well paying job at a very well known university. I took her to a $500/hr  lawyer who got her a decent settlement for wrongful termination. I didn't get a cup of coffee as thanks.

So, is there a time limit on going after what is my rightful share of her RRSP's? She broke the separation agreement. I have all the paperwork.",4,1735439144.0,legaladvicecanada,1,0.75,False

I‚Äôm a (F,29) and my best friend (F,30) have been friends for about 4 years since Covid lockdown. We met through mutual friends. For 4 years we did everything together and spoke every day. Recently a few things have happened in our friendship group causing some people to fall out. 

My best friend has a habit of lying and making stories up, I‚Äôm a typical people pleaser so I go along with most things as I don‚Äôt want to upset people.
She‚Äôs been caught on in a few lies, which has caused upset.

My other friends started to notice when we went away for a holiday that she can be really horrible to me. She makes mean jokes, embarrasses me in front of others, can be quite cruel in general. Some of my other friends said she was a bit of a bully.
Now I didn‚Äôt really pay attention to this un till she started to judge my relationship and what me and my husband like to do together. Constantly saying we need to go out on more dates together etc, when in reality we do have dates just they include take away and board games together or movies nights in (Which I shouldn‚Äôt have to explain to someone).  

Anyway long story short I‚Äôve kinda taken a step back and withdrew from her. She‚Äôs asked me several times if she‚Äôs done anything wrong and me being a people pleaser has said no because I don‚Äôt want to upset her. 

My plan was to see her little and often for coffee catch ups and hope it fizzles out etc.

Prefer long term. 100% no-ghosting guarantee! ,"I'd love to connect with a friend or two locally or internationally for some good times and some fun day to day chat. Anything goes from ranting about work/family to discussing/creating wild conspiracy theories, from sharing life stories to pictures of interesting trees/graffiti/anything else. 

I'm a working professional. Outside of work, I volunteer, exercise, visit local markets, cook, binge on horror/psych thriller movies/shows, and read. I can easily pick up a random topic to talk about, but my main interests include fitness, exercise, finance, and cooking. I love coffee, straight up black with nothing else (except water... Boiling water!). Dark jokes are welcome. I enjoy learning about people's life experiences and perspectives on different things. I'm genuinely good at listening too for when you need to vent. 

I'm open to all locations, relationship statuses, employment statuses, native languages, ages, ethnicities, religions, etc. As long as we can hold a good conversation and vibe well, that's all that matters. A big plus would be if we share the total despise for ghosting too üëª

The first piece of information is the projected monthly income you may enjoy if the planets align... - It's header is ""You may have"" 

The second piece of information is titled ""You may need"" and the third is ""Excess income""

To the right of the ""You may need"" label is a little question mark in a circle. It is a hyperlink to information that explains this middle figure. ( figure not finger...) When clicked the text box pops up displays 

**""This represents an estimate of the average monthly expenses you may need in retirement to cover your expenses.""**

Truly couldn't ask for a better partner and I try to let her know every day. Today we got pretty upset with each other though. 

She wanted to spend some family time so she took the twins to her parents house for the day. First time in months that I've had any time to myself, and holy shit the stars aligned that it was 4 straight hours. Hallelujah! 

So I split it. I took care of chores and errands for 2 hours and did my own thing for the other 2. She's always telling me to take care of myself and I did! It felt great for once.

Then she comes home. Uh oh. Why wasn't the bathroom fully cleaned? Why didn't I wipe down the counters? Why didn't I get the coffee table just a little bit more organized? These are all just five minute jobs, what did I even do with my afternoon? 

Well... I did the dishes, which she's stopped seeing because I'm so on top of it that the default state of the sink is ""clean"". I did two loads of laundry that went from hamper to washer to dryer to folded in the dresser before she even noticed it needed doing. I did a quick wipe down of the bathroom but not a deep clean. I went to the pharmacy for medicine. I did quite a bit actually.

Feeling a bit defeated at the moment. She's always trying to support me and tell me that I need to carve out time to take care of my self. When I don't do that, and I become pretty irritable and difficult to be around. Then I do take that time and it's ""well you should have at least done this that and the other before you took care of yourself.""

No right way to live, but if I'm going to be in trouble then at least I got to play some vidya today.",458,1735438449.0,daddit,93,0.96,False
