1o4nmdf,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkslope/comments/1o4nmdf/looking_for_help_navigating_our_elderly_neighbors/,Looking for help navigating our elderly neighbors in the morning,"Hoping to get some advice on what my wife and I have been doing wrong this summer! After living here for five years there‚Äôs been a sharp uptick in the amount of senior neighbors muttering under their breath or outright confronting my wife and I when we walk to the coffee shop in the morning.

These incidents have ranged from not liking the way our 6lb dog was eyeing the leaves, to being chastised this morning for walking on the sidewalk whilst crabapples had fallen? They always occur around 7am.

Is there something we should be doing differently? We‚Äôre thinking about having kids here but I can only imagine how they would intensify the animosity we‚Äôre encountering. Is there a non-profit funding education about sidewalk rights? Should we be changing our behavior (my wife‚Äôs laugh could be perceived as loud?). Is our mistake using sidewalks in the first place, and we‚Äôd be better off buying a car, driving down one block and double-parking in front of the coffee shop in the morning? We love it here and don‚Äôt want to cause issues, but after silently taking the abuse for so long I wonder if we‚Äôre doing something wrong‚Ä¶",1,1760271606.0,parkslope,0,1.0,False

1o4nk6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/OriginalCharacter/comments/1o4nk6c/interview_with_dimitri/,Interview with Dimitri,"That armchair was sinfully comfortable. I would almost forgive this whole charade for it.

""Dimi,"" the General began that morning, ""you scare people, even our own. The Culture Department had an idea ‚Äì we'll bring a few journalists and film an interview‚Äî""  
""Egone, with respect, that‚Äôs bullshit.""  
""‚Äîand show your less professional side,"" he continued calmly, still observing me with his one good eye.  
""Less professional side?"" I rubbed the bridge of my nose. What idiot came up with this? It must be Bl√∂dworm. Either way, that stupid worm whispered it to someone.  
""You know perfectly well what I am,"" I sighed, ""what I‚Äôve always been. This is my life. I can't pretend to be someone else.""

He rubbed his chin with a crippled hand and was silent for a moment. He tapped his cane thoughtfully on the floor a few times, perhaps so his thoughts would march to the rhythm he had so firmly set.

""Show them you can bark more than just orders,"" he turned to me with a short but brutal command.

And so I sit here, slowly melting under the glare of the spotlight, trying not to accidentally scare someone just by my existence. The moderator closest to me, a young rookie, looks as if I‚Äôm about to throw him to the piranhas.

""Mr. Minister-Major,"" he starts, nearly tripping over his tongue just saying the address, ""it is an honor to have you as part of our program today. The viewers, both here in the studio and at home, must be thrilled by such a visit. Thank you!""

The hall fills with lukewarm applause and pained smiles. I try to smile too, but without showing my teeth, and just nod condescendingly.

""So,"" he clears his throat and glances at his notes, ""let‚Äôs start with the questions. A classic one we ask every guest - What does your typical day look like, Mr. Major?""

I had to suppress a laugh.

""Typical day?"" I asked, just to be sure I hadn't misheard.  
""Yes,"" he nodded eagerly, a strained smile on his lips; he knew himself we were playing a farce, ""roughly what time do you wake up? Do you eat breakfast, or not? Do you walk or drive to work‚Äî""  
""Are you planning to blow up my car, Radim?"" I shot a glance at his badge and no longer hid my sneer. This is starting off well. A few audience members chuckled nervously, and the color drained from his face.

""I check it daily, so I‚Äôll answer‚Äî"" I waved my hand dismissively.

""I wake up at half-past four. Because of the briefings. I usually don't eat breakfast, just drink coffee, and often skip lunch, eating only at night after work. I drive to the HQ, go through the papers the assistant left on my desk, light a cigarette, then deal with the day's agenda. I finish around ten, but it often drags on until midnight, especially when there are some ground 'actions' involved.""

I noticed a subtle murmur among the rows of the audience. Actions, of course. Actions that involve broken fingers and muffled screams. I didn't want to seem out of touch with fieldwork; otherwise, I‚Äôd just become a glorified desk rat who occasionally, just to save face, goes to squeeze information out of someone in the basement.

""That is truly relentless dedication to the state,"" he commented, perhaps in the only permissible way.  
""I look like it, too,"" I couldn't resist a quiet remark, ""so, we already know when and where to wait for me with a knife‚Äîwhat else have you prepared for me?"" I tried for a playful tone, but it must have been a misstep. Well, he should have asked better questions.

""How would you like people to remember you?""  
""You‚Äôre talking about me as if I were already six feet under,"" I snorted, ""as... as what I am. Dimitri Groza.""

""And what exactly does being Dimitri Grozou entail?"" the moderator continued.

""Being as strong as a rock and not fretting unnecessarily about things. And now, the next question, I'm truly not one for philosophizing,"" I urged him on. He started rummaging through his notes. For a moment, I caught a glimpse of a densely scribbled sheet of paper with many crossed-out lines.

""What-"" he had to clear his throat again, ""what lie hurt you the most when you heard it?"" he finished, raising his eyes to me with a smile that even pained me.

""That I force things upon women with violence,"" it slipped out before I could think it through. He raised an eyebrow at that. Perhaps he expected me to mention the whispers about my fascination with straps and belts. Or, if he were being naive, that I would lie about what goes on in the basement.

""I have a sister,"" I continued, attempting a nonchalant tone and taking off my beret, ""she practically raised me when our parents died. I'm far from a saint, but I would never allow myself that. To violate someone. I see a piece of her in every woman, after all.""

Wonderful, Dimo, now you've given away another potential target for the anarchists. It's a good thing she's buried in such an inconspicuous place that not even an oracle could find her.

""That's actually beautiful,"" he managed to say, but immediately continued: ""that women remind you of your sister. You must really love her, mustn't you?""

Make a note to myself‚Äîcheck out Radim Such√°nek. Either he's just trying to break the silence in an unfortunate way, or he's provoking me.

""Of course. Don't you love your siblings? If you have any. Blood is thicker than water."" I settled deeper into the armchair and crossed one leg over the other, the tip of my boot now pointing towards him.

""And now, a question many of us ask. Where did you grow up, Minister-Major?"" He ignored my remark and continued as if nothing happened. But I noticed his eyes darting to the metal-reinforced sole and then to the subtle bulge of the holstered weapon on my thigh.

""The countryside,"" I blurted out. They won't get the name out of me. Not after I revealed Ilona's existence.

""So, a green stripe?"" He dared to use our own ranking system against me.  
""Yes, green, brown, and black,"" I agreed, ""pretty good progress towards yellow, wouldn't you say?"" I grinned.

""Time flies, so now let the audience ask a few questions!"" he announced, clapping his hands. One of the spotlight cones moved to the now buzzing seats. For a moment, I scanned the faces, some still wearing strained grimaces or expressions of sad neutrality, and wondered how much this event was a planned euthanasia of my career.

Radim stood up and jumped off the stage floor with excessive speed. With the microphone in hand, he pointed to the audience.  
""Ask away! I'll only call on a few lucky ones!"" he declared with undisguised happiness that he was no longer sitting next to me.

The audience turned into a forest of hands. He searched for a moment before pointing to a girl in a purple sweater. She stood up and accepted the microphone brought by the crew. She wasn't looking at me, but at the ceiling of the room.

""You spoke of strength, Mr. Major, so I wondered if there were moments when even that didn't help you. Who, or what, and how hurt you the most?""

""I could say smallpox. It killed my mother, father, brothers, and sisters. It scarred my face into this spectacle‚Äî"" I grinned and pointed to my face, ""‚Äîand not just that, I have scars everywhere. But honestly? Anarchy,"" I snorted, ""and I don't mean monarchists. I don't mean the resistance. I mean the general mess of the world and life."" I didn't even realize I had dug my fingers into the armrest of the chair. I wasn't going to elaborate further. The hall fell silent for a moment before Radim recovered and signaled for the questioner to sit down again.

""Thank you for your answer,"" she breathed out tremulously, tears welling up.

""Next question‚Äî"" he began scanning the faces in the audience. It took suspiciously long. He couldn't find the planted stooge from the production in that crowd.

From the forest of hands, one emerged waving with more desperation than the others, and the equally lost moderator called on him. When the hall quieted, and he saw the face of the questioner, his eye twitched.

""How can you even sleep at night?!"" the man almost yelled, sitting down without being asked.  
""How?"" I repeated before Radim could intervene.

I folded my arms across my chest and watched the presumptuous man, even though he tried to hide his face behind the edge of his scarf.  
""There are nights when I don't sleep. I smoke cigarettes and stare at the sky. At the sleeping city, those blinking lights. At the silhouette of the HQ on the horizon. But,"" I straightened up and tilted my head to the side, ""there are nights when I fall asleep with a sense of a job well done. So I either sleep or I don't,  if that‚Äôs what interests you.""

I turned to the moderator.  
""So, what now? I'm already trembling with anticipation for what else you have for me.""

""What is your relationship with your author?"" a voice sounded behind my shoulder. I turned around, but all I saw was the darkness of the backstage area.

The hall falls silent. All the lights, except for that annoying spotlight, dim and leave me alone. I am no longer in B√´rnung, no longer in my universe, but instead in the middle of a diorama in a shoebox. A paper cutout, a rough sketch to which is pinned a collage of military uniforms from various regimes, a swatch of rotten browns, photos of combat boots, a few random men with prominent noses. Behind my back breathe references to history lessons, The Starry Hour of Murderers, Mephisto, and M ‚Äì A son of the Century. Somewhere in the distance, an industrial sound similar to a march, interwoven with the affected German of a Slovenian group, plays softly.

""To her?"" I raised a finger towards the ceiling. In the darkness, I can barely make out a few deep eyes framed by spectacle rims.

""I am an archetype bordering on a caricature. I am a superficial knowledge of Italian fascism, sadism, Gestapo and Soviet interrogation. I am the mannerisms of many and no one. I am the knowledge of cruel reality applied in a fictional world. A study for one,"" I tried to summarize the wave of thoughts that the breaking of the walls had given me. That newfound lucidity that was tearing my brain to shreds.

""A study for her. Because it‚Äôs easier to deal with a fictional fascist regime than to watch the real world burn. Maybe she wants to prepare, to see and understand the mechanisms of evil. Which I appreciate, even if she is practically arming herself against me,"" I spread my arms. The pain in my temples was becoming unbearable.

With a groan, I got to my feet and took a few steps across the stage. I was completely stiff.

""What did you expect?"" I yelled into the deserted audience. Dead silence, except for three shy pairs of eyes.  
""An ode? A surprise?"" I was shouting now. My pulse was deafening. They just blinked. Typical.

I had to close my eyes for a moment. The light was becoming blinding.

Slowly, as if from the bottom of a well, the buzzing of the audience returned, and the pain eased. I opened them again.

""Thank you for coming, Minister-Major Groza!"" Radim sang beside me. I stood face-to-face with the smiling masks that were applauding.

""And that's all, dear viewers, those in the studio and at home. Goodbye, and thank you for tuning into our program!""",1,1760271423.0,OriginalCharacter,0,1.0,False

I have been to probably six meetings, all of which I have bailed out on after less than 20 minutes. After attending two Recovery Dharma meetings, AA seems more and more like a cult.

Last night I went to yet another beginners' AA meeting, mostly attended by AA lifers. The way they begin every meeting with that creepy ""they were born that way . . ."" preamble and the way the whole room recites responses as one reminded me so much of the Catholic churches I was raised in.

The meetings are all drab, shitty coffee, fight your way through a cloud of cigarette smoke to enter, fluorescent lights, hard metal chairs, the same BS posters on the wall with the stupid fonts that say ""One Day at a Time,"" the weird references to ""being in the rooms,"" etc.

Recovery Dharma meetings are candles, pillows, meditation, meaningful reading, sane discussion that doesn't retread the same things time after time. Thoughtful people and thoughtful support.

I let the guy move into my place after about 6 months. The kid would come over and cry NON STOP and follow his dad around. It was too much for me so I started leaving my own house during the day on his weekends. 

At one point early on there was a huge thing w his BM,  him, and me where BM accused us of abusing the kid but we didnt. She got CPS involved and everything. 

Then about 2 years late mom ended up putting a new kid she had in a coma from abuse and we ended up having to get his kid anyways. His kids was still a nightmare. He had different rules for his kid than my kid. He REFUSED to send him to therapy. I suspected his kid had ASD on top of the trauma he suffered from his mom but he refused help for him. Instead he would choose to work 72 hours a week and leave me w him. He financial abused me. It was so bad. He kicked my son and me out about a month after my dad passed from cancer, and moved a new woman in a month later to take care of the kid smh. 

Fast forward to my new SO. Im MUCH MUCH more cautious now. He has 3 kids, same BM,  but i have maintained my own home. He has his own hom. We have been together  a little over 3 years and I absolutely REFUSE to move in together, even though moving in would save me a vast amount in rent, would allow me to go back to school, probably get me out of debt, ect. I just cant do it. His kids are also awful, entitled, manipulative, and he parents out of guilt. 

Im just curious if other women now dont like other people's kids after dating men with kids? My friends kids are pretty awful also. I cant stand when she brings all 3 of them to my house lmao. They run through my house, run in and out of my back door, come in and out with their shoes on, talk over the adults when were having a conversation, mess in stuff, one of them broke one of my favorite coffee mugs. They are old enough to know better too BTW. Her oldest is like 10. ",1,1760270687.0,Stepmom,0,1.0,False

Even with the grind size at finest, the resulting coffee is just running light colored water with some sourness. Before the problem, at those same settings, the coffee would drip out slowly and would have been overextracted. The resulting puck now is about 8 mm thick, whereas before it could reach a few cm. The problem persists even after descaling, cleaning the grinder and all the chutes, brew group and many other parts that get coffee on them. 
Any ideas what could be the cause? Is it some computer error, faulty sensor (if it uses either of those), or some mechanical error, maybe I missed something while cleaning?

Another weird thing that happens sometimes is that the machine starts to pump water through the coffee, then stops, at which point you can hear it slosh around somewhere and a little bit comes through to the cup, and then after a few seconds the rest comes. But I don't know if it contributes to the problem or is normal.",1,1760270584.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

Vanilla cake, chocolate cake, lemon cake, carrot cake, coffee cake, chocolate chip cookies, vanilla shortbread, lemon biscuits, vanilla buttercream, chocolate buttercream, lemon buttercream, lemon curd and then a tin of Carnations caramel because who's got the time?!

Bonus toppings of fresh strawberries and raspberries, sprinkles and marshmallows.

I'm a 38M daydreamer / overthinker in remission. I'd love to find someone who wants to build connections around some unholy mix of deep compassion, flirty fun, exploration both mental and physical, and just sharing a coffee together. A simple coffee though; my love of adjectives doesn't translate well to coffee orders.

I am fully in-love with my life, married and poly (dating separately) with a family I'm grateful to call mine. I'd love to meet someone who's secure in their situations and looking for more growth. I'm demisexual & pan, though generally more attracted to feminine energy. 

I don't expect to find anyone local as I live fairly rural, but I'd love for an opportunity to take a walk together. Closest major metro area to me is Pittsburgh, but it's still a bit of a drive. Drives can be fun though; builds the anticipation.

I've recently found that scribbling poetry is more cathartic to me than journaling. I've found that my favorite songs sound better when belting them out, even if it pushes me into falsetto. I've found that seeing my latest mile time come across my watch is better than remembering I'm not as fast as I used to be. I've found that being a walking human contradiction is much more fun than trying to be anything you're not. 

So you be you, and I'll be me, and we'll see where that takes us. Let's share the laughs, the sobs, the funny jabs, and all the random thoughts that we can't even fully articulate. Good things take time, so let's grow together.",1,1760270099.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1o4n2g4,https://www.reddit.com/r/politicalsham/comments/1o4n2g4/remember_it_was_trumps_firstterm_fbi_not_bidens/,"REMEMBER, It was Trump's first-term FBI, NOT BIDEN'S FBI... (From Ben Meiselas)","At 12:37 AM, Donald Trump posted on his social media that ‚ÄúTHE BIDEN FBI PLACED 274 AGENTS INTO THE CROWD ON JANUARY 6‚Ä¶DO SOMETHING!!!‚Äù

Donald Trump was the president on January 6, 2021. The FBI was controlled by Trump then, not Biden‚Äîand Biden would not be sworn in for another two weeks. In addition, even Trump official Kash Patel has acknowledged that the FBI was not placed in the crowd that day when Trump was president. The FBI responded to the scene of the insurrection after it took place, since its job was to respond to crimes. As of January 2025, over 1,000 insurrectionists have pled guilty to their crimes, and every one of the 220 cases that went to jury trial ended in a conviction. In all of those cases, the defendants were given all the evidence and never made a claim that the FBI was behind January 6, as Trump now claims while tweeting at 12:37 AM.

Trump is making this statement in the middle of a government shutdown he caused because he refuses to protect the healthcare of Americans. Trump and Republicans refuse to even talk to Democrats. Yet Trump is posting deranged conspiracies about January 6 at 12:37 AM and calling the FBI under his first term the ‚ÄúBIDEN FBI.‚Äù

Trump‚Äôs priorities include spreading deranged conspiracies, building ballrooms and ‚Äútriumphant arches‚Äù in D.C., sending the U.S. military to invade Democratic states and cities, giving $20 billion to Argentina instead of protecting healthcare for 20 million Americans, and building Qatari Air Force bases inside the United States.

As you likely know, the markets tanked on Friday, and the crypto markets had a full-fledged crash, liquidating $19 billion in a day. This was caused by Donald Trump‚Äôs erratic response after China announced further export controls on rare earth elements (REE) that the United States depends on for the production of almost all technologies. China has also bankrupted American farmers by refusing to buy their products. None of this was happening under Biden. This is a direct response to Trump declaring a trade war against China while simultaneously declaring trade wars against the rest of the world so that no one would have our back. It‚Äôs sheer lunacy.

In normal times, Trump would be impeached and convicted and/or have the 25th Amendment invoked on him for dozens of things he does each day. However, our corporate news and media environment has been poisoned and is now an arm of the regime. Our corporate leaders are regime puppets.

So where does that leave us? We the people must reclaim the power. We the people hold the power. The regime is terrified of the No Kings Protest taking place on October 18. They are saying it‚Äôs an ANTIFA and anti-America rally. They call it a pro-HAMAS rally. They are scared as can be, which is why they are defaming these peaceful protests. October 18 will be the largest day of mass mobilization in the history of the United States. As we get closer to the day, we can expect the regime to accelerate its fear tactics and attacks on the peaceful protest.

One thing has been made clear this week: the Trump regime is showing how weak it is. Trump is acting from a place of weakness, not strength. China is playing him like a fiddle. The strength of the United States is eroding fast abroad. Here at home, our economy is hanging by a thread as Trump‚Äôs Ponzi-scheme economy unravels.

We must all remain vigilant and we must all remain united. There are difficult times ahead for sure, but I promise you we will weather them together. We are going to have a hugely successful October 18 No Kings Protest. Trump‚Äôs behavior will continue to cause him to lose more support here and abroad. The MeidasTouch Network will continue to grow.

We at the MeidasTouch Network are honored to be a unifying voice for the resistance and opposition against the Trump regime during this period. We‚Äôve been able to amass an audience bigger than Fox News, all cable networks, and Joe Rogan. This means we are able to get truthful and accurate news out to the public and control the narrative with facts. With each passing week, we continue to expand our lead over Fox, our closest competitor in digital news.

So let‚Äôs keep growing and keep calling out this regime. I always love these Sunday posts because I can check in with you and thank you for all you do and your hard work. I am honored to be in the trenches with you day in and day out fighting for democracy. Let‚Äôs keep pursuing this mission together.

1o4n11w,https://www.reddit.com/r/LucidDreaming/comments/1o4n11w/i_found_a_weird_sleep_glitch_that_traps_me_in/,I found a weird sleep glitch that traps me in dream loops within the first hour of sleep,"I found a weird sleep glitch that traps me in dream loops within the first hour of sleep

So‚Ä¶ this has happened to me rarely. It depends... sometimes twice a month, sometimes only once. During summers it happened a lot...


Here‚Äôs my experience: sometimes I drink coffee (a really light one, just milk and sugar.) at night and go to bed 2/3/4 hours later, something strange happens. 

This whole thing starts within the first hour of sleep

I fall into these short but super vivid dreams, chaotic but not really nightmares. I wake up, feel insanely sleepy, and fall right back into another dream again. It keeps looping: dream, wake, dream, wake, until I get annoyed and tell myself as soon as i wake up... ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just get up, drink water, and walk for a couple of minutes.‚Äù And the moment I do that, the whole loop stops, and I instantly fall into deep sleep. I don‚Äôt get why it happens, how can my dreams be that vivid before the real REM period even starts?

It‚Äôs really hard to actually get up during these loops to drink water, since I only have about a 10 second window before I fall asleep again lol


What‚Äôs actually triggering this? Is it a bad sleep cycle, or am I just a coffee addict? (I'm not kidding when i say my coffee is really light)


I can say it‚Äôs not unhealthy, since I actually enter a really deep sleep after finally ending this loop and wake up after a full 8 hours without any interruptions.

Can I possibly trigger this intentionally? If yes, how, and should I try using it to lucid dream?

I dont know where else to go family friends and police either cannot or will not help im in one of those moments it seems like someone's else's life or a fantasy movie I would not wish this on another. However im deeply troubled by this and im looking for real guidance and advice or people who have insight or had simillar thing happened. In life things can seem to crazy to be true nothing but a feeling I ignored for too long at least in my case to tell you here's more or less what changed my life forever and im still doing my best to navigate/make sense of. I know they say dont get involved with these things however yoda also said one day you might be confronted by great darkness and have to make a choice. It is my belief and sickening feeling I have in my stomach keepinging multiple lives are at serious risk at any potential moment im doing my best to manage fear and see it clearly. Im probably what you would describe simply as a /muscian addict interested in maths and science and  spiritualality. I see a psychologist to manage my depression and anxiety and ptsd every 2 weeks to help get through. With all the above in mind this is what happened over the last year. 

My brother in laws father comes back into his life out of seemingly the blue he has an off an on again relationship with a seemingly nice woman who was an alcholic at the time but I felt warm and nice. The man however I felt evil day 1 weird energy guy, quietly was watching me so closely too closely to not introduce himself. I didnt realise at the time but he wasnt just watching me but ill go more into that later with evidence ive aquired. My brother in law seems like a happy go lucky hippy kind with big circle of friends the DJ thing is a bit wanky but you look past it he comes of as nice and looks to be taking care of my sisters partner and they now have two kids. Fast forward a couple of years and me and my partner have been together roughly 10 years unfortunately off and on again but were doing couples therapy and trying our best to address our issues. We lose a few kids to and life hits hard after covid on top of finacial stress our childhood ptsd creeping up and its like a perfect storm and you wouldn't beilive me if I told you it was man made but I think theres an incredibly high probability it was. Ill take a closer look at my brother in law later their were signs I ignored but this person is incredibly deceptive and cruel. I wouldn't belive me over him but I know my true north and what im saying is true I would rather be crazy than have this happen to me. So my partner starts feeling like shes not a good sister and has too visit her sister more I notice over this time she is deteriorating but I thought it was just her drinking brother in law encouraging it. One day becomes suicidal I handle it badly say she need to go home but I was so broken from the ups and downs of her alcholism it was at times a long night. 

I didnt fully know at that time that home was were here drinking came from and how abusive her dad was who was always nice to me and how neglectful her mum but unfortunately my parents are simillar and it was nice having a dad for once who at least pretended to take interest in me. In hindsight completely not worth it. 

So we're in the process of selling our house and im suicidal too and have returned to drugs and its escalating. She moves out with her sister our beatuful dog I miss every day. My brother in law their two kids and his father who's now broken up with his partner and will apparently fund it all up front and pays for everything for his son/business etc and is also know to hide money from now ex makes this clear to my now ex which I think is very strange. But we're keeping in contact we return to couples therapy and things are getting better she falls pregnant with my child im nearly certain at least thats what she told me but everything that is about to follow has changed the way I view people what there capable of and my ability to trust and  understand people this will likely not go away. We're back together Christmas is approaching and she loses the child in her recovery she was getting additional therapy to help with drinking when I noticed my brother in law pass her a drink so quitley and cold he knows her struggle he can have a ciggie and stop kind of person. There's sadness but some of my last words spoken with her wer warm she said I know in my heart were meant to be and you've been so good ill get you something nice for  Christmas. Fast forward untill then not a word no call can reach no message nobody knows whats up and im just about to drive over to see wtf is going on Christmas day is here im worried shes in trouble or drank to much something bad happen etc. I start driving over and I get a call from her dead panned sounds like ai not my partner not using words like her. Say Ms shes been feeling like we should break up its been a long time comming I say im comming round she says not a good idea theres someone else im really shocked but I accept it the whole time it felt like someone guiding her through that conversation. I think its likely one of my brother in laws friends but I have this feeling its his dad but noway right thats too crazy to be true shes his daughters auntie it doesn't make sense and hes disgusting in every way. But I felt it for a while, time goes on 3 months im fully back on drugs going harder then ever with no truth but a feeling. I press my brother in law he says he will meet me for coffee to talk 6 months go on im fucked on the drugs spent everything im half dead long lost job and unable to do uni I get mad and press him harder all this time been messaging ex daily somethings mentioned would normally warrant a response at least but nothing full radio silence. I lie and say I saw them together he buys and and says again okay its true we can meet up and talk about it I say fuck that he had his chance to tell me im going to confront him and let him know exactly what I think of you all. This has completely broken me and I feel so betrayed. I drive to his shop because neither of them would meet me I dont want to go to the house mad drugged up when her sister and young kids are there so I go to his shop his not there, im like fuck it i have to go to the house i go call them when im there but nobdies home i saw the realtor and they were pissed were even going to tell me their new address, i get through to them and pretend i dont know that their not there but im so sad i think im just talking to my brother in law and i break down saying how betrayed i felt i hear then in the backround the dad burst into no shit joker level laughter then my brother in law whos been pretending he didnt like what they were doing jump in calling me stupid yeah hes fuckinging her there like nearly jacking themselves off over my pain he starts even speaking in like these weird tounges it was like i was talking to a completely different thing like the mask came off ive errupted with emotion saying im going to kill them ive never been so mad In my life..... ill find them he says there off in another state . I start  also briefly talking to her dad who knew months before me didnt tell me but was also concerned about his dad to the point he had a police friend digging, he said he also didnt like the dad mentioning these weird paedophile rings in England and he also thought this guy was evil but couldnt see it in my bro in law who was always sucking up his ass asking for money getting special treatment while we got fuck all and worked like dogs without a cents help to get our house. Annyway now I have this new sickening feeling and can't sleep because I dont know what else this farther Son (possibly not even) psychos are capable of but i know its real bad and there gonna get off over it. Out of fear and being broke at the time I end up demanding to know where they are from my experience dad he refuses I hit him a few times stop when I notices his crying but nobody has seen them for months and im fearing the worst at this point I threaten his life but was never going to act on it. Some more wild things happen after I will go into much further detail about but I end up doing time rightfully so for hitting an elderly citizen. I never found out where they were he ran inside I never meant it. So that was that he also said when I went to the shop they were watching me on the camera and feared I would hurt his parter who was for some reason around there I never saw with the kids?? After prison ive tried to let it go and sobered up but theres much more to this im just beginning to get tired of writting for now but lots of people reached out to me and confirmed ny fears of who they are cruel and psychotic as stated by a clinical professional. The whole thing likely a setup. I know my true north is to save lives of two girls one innocent and I fucking vouched this monster to her 2 kids and the most beautiful dog in the world  completely innocent will experience a life of hell any questions can and will be answered in more detail. I can provide rough profiles on those involved. Ill write more when I recover some energy its hard to talk about this stuff and the rabbit hole goes sooooo much deeper.",1,1760269653.0,PhysicsStudents,0,0.67,False

I had to re-roll 4 times to get desserts. Thanks to Dedenne and some good luck, I had 7 crits this week too. My Gard was absolutely amazing this week, making sure that my team went to bed with at least 100% energy every night. 

After failing to reach M20 on OGPP in a heartbreaker last month, this achievement feels great. I‚Äôm happy and relieved to have made it - and with time to spare, as I still have 2 meals left.

It‚Äôs been a fun and rewarding event overall. I cleared out 7 3* and 4* sleep styles that I was missing, and the meal boost was so helpful for me.

1o4mvys,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnboxedOpinions/comments/1o4mvys/explore_if_odoban_carpet_cleaner_truly_transforms/,Explore If OdoBan Carpet Cleaner Truly Transforms Dirty Floors,"**My Experience with the OdoBan 960261**

Ever find yourself dealing with stubborn carpet stains that just refuse to budge? That‚Äôs where the OdoBan 960261 caught my attention. As someone constantly battling spills, pet accidents, and mysterious carpet marks (thank you, children and their unidentifiable sticky substances), I decided to put this product to the test. The promise of a 3-in-1 cleaner that functions as a traffic lane pretreatment, extraction cleaner, and spot remover sounded too good to pass up. After using this cleaner daily for over a month, I‚Äôm ready to share my insights.

**Good Aspects**

What immediately stood out was its multifunctionality. Having a product that combines three cleaning purposes in one is not only convenient but also a game-changer for anyone tired of juggling multiple cleaning solutions. Here are a few standout features that made my experience worthwhile:

- The no-rinse formula meant one less step for me, and the carpets dried significantly faster‚Äîaround 75% quicker than traditional cleaners.
- It‚Äôs environmentally friendly, which is great since I have pets and kids to think about. The EPA Safer Choice label gave me peace of mind while using it in our living spaces.
- I noticed no strong chemical odors, which has often been a dealbreaker with other carpet cleaners. Instead, it left a fairly neutral and fresh scent behind.
- Completely compatible with my deep carpet cleaning machine, making it easy to integrate into my regular cleaning routine without worrying about clogging or damage.

**Drawbacks**

Despite its strengths, no product is perfect. During testing, I found a few areas where improvements could make this cleaner even better:

- It performed wonderfully on fresh stains, but older, stubborn stains required multiple rounds of application before yielding satisfactory results.
- For larger carpeted areas, I found myself going through the gallon faster than I would have liked.
- While the design of the container is practical, it could benefit from a more precise pouring spout to avoid small spills while transferring it to the machine or directly on the carpet.

**[Check OdoBan 960261 price on Amazon.](https://review.sanue.com/p/b06y23x2j1/)**  

**Ease of Use**

Using the product was a breeze. The instructions were straightforward, and the fact that I didn‚Äôt need a separate foaming agent or additional rinsing agents simplified the process even further. I typically pretreated high-traffic areas with a spray bottle before running the cleaning machine for the overall carpet. On smaller stains, dabbing directly with a clean cloth and diluted solution worked like magic. The carpet dried quickly‚Äîperfect for those times when kids are impatiently waiting to reclaim their play zone.

**Performance and Results**

Performance-wise, this carpet cleaner genuinely exceeded expectations. After seeing its ability to tackle dirt tracks in high-traffic areas such as the hallway and living room, I was convinced it lived up to the 3-in-1 claim. It visibly revitalized the fibers, making them appear softer and newer. Even the faint outlines of past disasters (e.g., spilled coffee or soda) faded after consistent treatment. However, I still had to balance my expectations‚Äîmiracles were few and far between with deep, dried-in stains.

**Alternative Products**

In comparison to other brands I‚Äôve tried, I would rate this as having better versatility and overall convenience. Products like Bissell Deep Clean + Refresh worked well, but I did notice a stronger chemical aroma and longer drying times. Hoover‚Äôs Paws & Claws concentrated formula, while excellent for targeting pet-related messes, didn‚Äôt match the OdoBan in terms of drying speed or eco-friendliness. This cleaner's EPA approval made it a standout option for households with kids and pets, setting it apart in safety and environmental responsibility. 

**Price to Quality Ratio**

As someone constantly experimenting with cleaning products, I‚Äôve had my fair share of sub-par performers and overpriced solutions. While the OdoBan might not be the most budget option on the market, the quality and time you save more than justify its cost. It replaced three individual cleaners I previously used, which makes it more economical long-term. Considering its performance in deep cleaning, spot removal, and pretreating tasks, I‚Äôd call this a smart investment for busy households.

On Sept 28, My husband and I were cuddling in bed and playing with baby girl in my belly right before bed. She was a fairly reactive baby, she would move to songs and her daddy‚Äôs voice as he talked to her and gave my belly kisses. The next day, we went about our extremely busy day and I was in denial the whole day until the L&D team confirmed our worst fears later that night. There was no heartbeat. The cruelest nightmare we can‚Äôt shake off as we replay that moment everyday. I was induced the next morning and gave birth to our sleeping angel Emi on Oct 1. The reason was unknown as baby, placenta, and cord all came out perfect. My OB personally delivered her and told us we did nothing wrong and there‚Äôs nothing we could have done in this case. We opted not to do an autopsy so we don‚Äôt put our girl through more. My husband told me she went sleeping in the safest place possible, and we can take comfort in the fact that it was the most peaceful, loving way to go. 

But I can‚Äôt feel peace. Everyday I find a new way to blame myself for what had happened, because we really don‚Äôt know. My mind is constantly flooded with the ‚Äúwhat ifs,‚Äù I replay every single thing I did in the previous weeks and days. Was it because I drank coffee? Was it because I liked the occasional coke (the pop)? Was it because I drank too little water? Did I drink too much water? Was it bottled water? Was that one bite of sushi not okay? Did I give her an infection I wasn‚Äôt aware of? Did I pass her my cold a few weeks ago? Did I do something to her in Pilates class? Did my work stress her out too? Should I have gone on mat leave earlier? What if it‚Äôs the way I slept? I heard sleeping on your back increases risk of stillborns. Am I part of this statistics unknowingly? But I mostly slept on my side trying hard not to land on my belly. Plenty of women have done way worse and their babies came out fine. Why did this happen to mine. I tried my best but it wasn‚Äôt enough, were all the fear mongers right after all? 

I‚Äôm a mother that couldn‚Äôt protect my baby. I should have advocated for her more, if I had only knew how. If only I could sense something was wrong sooner. If only I could sense anything was wrong at all to begin with. 

This pregnancy was textbook the entire way until it suddenly wasn‚Äôt. She had a strong heartbeat at every appointment, and passed every test. There was no need for concern at any stage until I felt no movement that day. And I‚Äôm left with so much self-torture over what I could have prevented or done better. I really tried my best, my fridge was full of foods that were good for her. My snack drawer stacked with healthy snacks so my girl never went hungry. I chugged so much water I can‚Äôt even look at water anymore. I miss her terribly, I long for her in the darkest night. I just wish I could have done better somehow, and I keep finding ways to beat myself up over it. I was her protector, my body was her temporary home. It was up to me, I should have known somehow. I thought I was already being so careful, clearly not careful enough. 

We want to try again, our OB sees no concerns and encourages us to try again once we‚Äôre cleared. He‚Äôs even told me to go on baby aspirin the second we get pregnant again. But what if the same thing happens? What the fuck is wrong with me.

Any angel mamas out there have any advice how to overcome this and be brave to do it again? The guilt and shame is eating me alive despite being told it wasn‚Äôt my fault and it just happens.

First I want to say I miss you. I miss talking to you, I miss going out with you, whether it be dinner or the time we spent just enjoying each others company when you were on your lunch break or just talking. I miss the sound of your voice when you‚Äôre telling me about your day and your laugh when you found something funny. I miss those eyes of yours that showed a lovely gaze when we look at each other. I miss holding your hand, even though you keep saying they‚Äôre rough‚Ä¶but I don‚Äôt think so. I also enjoyed when you said that only a select few besides your family got to see the real you, the silly, goofy, expressive kind woman that you are‚Ä¶and for that I‚Äôm grateful for. You were there for me when my mother died, when I had no one in my corner after my divorce during the funeral, I could count on you. And I did.

I want to pour my heart out and say what I didn‚Äôt have the chance to say, especially after that night. That conversation is still burned in my head and at times it replays more than I would like it to happen. A drunk phone call made me feel like you couldn‚Äôt be honest with me at all. Drunk talks are sober thoughts after all. I know you didn‚Äôt like hiding the fact that you were seeing me from your sister because of who I am. It hurts, it really does. It shows me that you‚Äôre letting a teenager run your life and I know you want to keep that bond and trust with her. However, you‚Äôre a grown woman who needs to make your own decisions for yourself. You told me that you hated hiding me from her and you considered me such a close person in your life that you told me things that you don‚Äôt even tell your best friends. During that call I know you were hurt, especially when I said I was contemplating leaving my job, you got angry and you don‚Äôt get angry often. That pain in your voice broke me because I know something was there‚Ä¶and when you cried at the end of our call‚Ä¶that made it worse. It marks my heart with pain and remorse that hurts so much.

What hurts now is when I see you around. You claim you‚Äôd be cordial but you aren‚Äôt. A smile with everyone but me‚Ä¶long conversations to everyone but me. When I saw you yesterday‚Ä¶you laughed and giggled with my coworker, the people around, everyone else but me. Like I did something wrong for liking you, for caring about you. That smile I adore that brightens up a room, that shines through‚Ä¶for everyone else but me. When we had our ‚Äúbrief‚Äù conversation, I saw it in your face, like you wanted to say more but you didn‚Äôt, you were holding back. Why hold back? Why not be honest with me when you‚Äôre sober? Am I that bad of a person that you can‚Äôt make decisions for yourself about me? As much as everyone tells me to move on, as much as you‚Äôve hurt me and broke me‚Ä¶I can‚Äôt. 

I‚Äôve been told to move on and I‚Äôve tried to do so. Trust me, I‚Äôve tried to forget this pain that you‚Äôve caused to maybe ease myself and concentrate more. If only you knew how badly you‚Äôve affected me, would you say anything? At work I can‚Äôt concentrate and I get depressed so much that I when I get home I sleep‚Ä¶all I want to do is sleep to the point where I don‚Äôt even eat. At times I cry to myself because I wonder if you think about me as I do for you. All I know is that your best friend told me that you called her crying after you called me and told her everything. Even your best friend was rooting for us. That‚Äôs a big deal when friends approve isn‚Äôt it? You don‚Äôt just introduce your best friend to anyone, especially someone who likes you? She even called me ‚Äúyour man‚Äù and you giggled when I told you she said that. I caught you blushing too and that made me smile.

I want to say more but my thoughts and heart are all over the place. All I think about are the good times we‚Äôve had: the charcuterie outings, going to baseball games, lunches together, the coffee that I would bring to you when you needed a pick me up. No matter what happens‚Ä¶you‚Äôll always have a place in my heart. I guess what hurts the most is that I just want to tell you so much but I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶because it seems like you wouldn‚Äôt want to hear from me. The worst part about this‚Ä¶I wasn‚Äôt looking for you to come into my life, you just did, it felt right and that‚Äôs what makes all of this harder on me. I want to know if I even meant anything to you, if someday maybe you‚Äôll come back. You did it once, then maybe it can happen again. I just wish things were different. I hope so, as much as I hope you wear that sunflower bracelet I gave you to remind yourself that when you have bad days, look at it and remind yourself of all the good because sunflowers are your favorite and they make you happy. As happy as your smile makes me‚Ä¶even if it‚Äôs not directed at me at the moment. 

-A love that never expected to happen is the one that hurts the most when it‚Äôs gone.

As mentioned in the title, I will be going to Colombia this December for 2.5 weeks and I am looking to see if my itinerary isn't too rushed or if I'm staying at certain places too long or too short. Basically all the things you get paranoid about when planning a trip.

Here is how it currently looks:

* **December 4-7th: Cartagena**
   * Getsemani, Walled City, Rosario Islands
* **December 7-10th :Santa Marta/Taganga**
   * Scuba diving, Tayrona National Park (just for the day, not actually sleeping in Cabo San Juan)
* **December 10-13th: Minca**
   * Seeing the waterfalls, bird watching, coffee tour and generally relaxing
* **December 13-16th: Medellin**
   * City Square, Botero Park. Communa 13, daytrip to Guatape
* **December 16-19th: Salento**
   * Valle de Cocora, Plaza di Bolivar
* **December 19-22nd: Bogota**
   * Botero and Gold Museum, Monserrate, Plaza Bolivar

My main niggles is sort of around the second half of the trip. Am I staying too much time in Minca for example? When I go abroad, especially faraway, I have a tough time relaxing and want to see as much as possible with the time I have. And is that time maybe eating away at Medellin, which when you put traveling there by plane into account, would mean I would only really have one real day in the city if I do a day trip to Guatape.

Any advice for things to shorten or extend or other things to do would be greatly appreciated.",1,1760268467.0,travel,0,1.0,False

1o4mkb5,https://i.redd.it/et5go2z71ouf1.jpeg,Wedding Night Betrayal: A Fading Heart (free link please),"The doctors gave me three years to live. I used every last bit of my strength to marry Cedric Moon, the man I loved.
On our wedding night, he abandoned me for another woman.
He brought her into our home, forcing me to serve her. He made me apologize for crimes I didn't commit. His family despised me, but they adored her.
Then came the staged kidnapping. To save her, Cedric traded me--his pr**nant wife--to the man holding a kn**e.
As the blade pressed against my throat, I heard my husband's voice yell at the police.
""Sh**t!""


Chapter 1
The wall clock showed it was almost midnight. Kacie Oliver sat alone in the vast wedding suite. The room was filled with white roses, Cedric' s favorite, but their scent felt suffocating.

This was her wedding night.

The door finally opened, and Cedric Moon walked in. He looked surprised to see her awake, still in her wedding dress.

""Kacie? Why aren't you asleep?""

His voice was calm, with no hint of guilt. It made the hollow space in her ch**t ache even more.

She didn't answer. Her mind drifted back to the afternoon. They were at the reception, about to share their first dance as husband and wife. Then his phone rang. He looked at the screen, his expression changing instantly.

""I have to go,"" he had said, his voice tight.

""What's wrong, Cedric?"" she had asked, her hand still on his arm.

""It's Jayden. She' s been in an accident.""

He didn't wait for her response. He just turned and walked away, leaving her standing alone in the middle of the dance floor, the whispers of the guests rising around her. He left his bride for another woman on their wedding day.

Now, hours later, the memory was a sharp, physical pain. Her heart, already weak, felt like it was being squeezed. The doctors had given her three years. Three years to live, to find love, to feel something real before her time ran out. She had thought she' d found it with Cedric.

""Jayden's car was hit,"" Cedric said now, pulling her back to the present. He walked over and started un**ttoning his shirt. ""It wasn't serious, just a few scratches, but she was scared. You know how she is.""

Kacie knew. She knew all too well.

""I need you to understand, Kacie. I have a responsibility to her."" He looked at her, his eyes asking for her compliance, for her to be the understanding wife.

But all she felt was a profound weariness. Her heart condition, cardiomyopathy, made every day a struggle. It was why she had pursued him so relentlessly. When she first saw Cedric Moon, the brilliant tech CEO, on the cover of a magazine, she felt a pull she couldn't explain. She knew she had little time, and she wanted a grand, all-consuming love story.

She had done everything to get his attention. She learned his routines, his favorite coffee shop, the park he jogged in. She engineered a dozen ""accidental"" meetings.

At first, he was dismissive, cold. People in his circle laughed at her, the unknown woman so obviously chasing the unreachable Cedric Moon. The humiliation was nothing compared to the ticking clock inside her ch**t.

Then came the company gala. He was dr**ged by a business rival, and she was the one who found him, disoriented and vulnerable. She got him to his hotel room, and one thing led to another. It was a messy, unplanned night.

The next morning, she expected him to be furious, to throw her out. Instead, he looked at her with a strange expression and said, ""I'll take responsibility.""

That was how it started. He officially accepted her, and they began dating. And to her shock, he was a good boyfriend. He was surprisingly gentle and attentive.

He remembered she didn' t like onions. He learned to cook her favorite soup because he said the food from restaurants wasn't healthy enough. He would hold her when she felt weak, his presence a warm anchor in her uncertain world.

One evening, her heart acted up. She collapsed at home, struggling to breathe. He found her, his face pale with a terror she had never seen before. He rushed her to the hospital, and as she lay in the bed, he held her hand and said, ""Marry me, Kacie. Let me take care of you.""

She had cried, believing her desperate quest was finally over. She had won.

She was discharged a week later. As they were leaving her room, a beautiful young woman appeared.

""Cedric, you' re here!"" the woman said, her voice bright. She linked her arm through his. ""I came as soon as I heard. Are you okay?"" She had completely ignored Kacie.

Cedric had gently removed her arm. ""Jayden, this is Kacie, my fianc√©e."" He then turned to Kacie. ""Kacie, this is Jayden Moore. She's like a little sister to me.""

Jayden was the daughter of Cedric's late mentor. He felt a profound sense of duty to her, a promise made to a dying man. His parents, Burt and Carroll Moon, adored Jayden. They saw her as the perfect daughter-in-law, a match in status and background. They saw Kacie as an outsider, an unwelcome disruption.

The conflict started subtly. At a company retreat, Jayden twisted her ankle. It was a minor sprain, but she cried out as if she' d been shot. Cedric immediately swept her up into his arms, his face a mask of worry, and rushed her to the medic, leaving Kacie standing with his colleagues.

He fussed over Jayden, his voice soft with concern, his hands gentle as he examined her ankle. He showed a level of panic and care that Kacie had only seen once before-when he thought she was dying.

That was the moment a cold dread settled in her heart. His tenderness wasn't just for her.

A week later, Jayden was transferred from the marketing department to become Cedric's personal secretary. She was always there, a constant presence in his life and, by extension, hers.

The night before the wedding, Kacie had gone to his study to find him. The door was slightly ajar. She saw Jayden sitting on his desk, leaning close, her hand on his ch**t. Cedric was looking down at her, his expression unreadable.

Kacie pushed the door open.

Jayden didn't look surprised. She just smiled, a slow, knowing smile. ""Oh, Kacie. Cedric was just helping me with a speck of dust in my eye."" Her voice was sweet, but her eyes were full of victory.

Now, standing in their wedding suite, Kacie looked at her husband. The man who had just abandoned her for that same woman. The hope she had clung to for so long was finally starting to crumble.


Chapter 2
Kacie took a deep breath, the scent of roses making her nauseous. She walked over to Cedric, her movements stiff. She helped him out of his jacket, her fingers brushing against his skin. He smelled strongly of al**hol. He never drank this much. It was bad for his health, a fact she knew he was well aware of. He must have been drinking to seal a deal for Jayden' s family's company. Another sacrifice for her.

He was drunker than she thought. As he swayed, his head lolled to the side, and he mumbled a name.

""Jayden...""

It was a soft, slurred sound, but it hit Kacie with the force of a physical blow.

From the hallway, Jayden's voice called out, ""Cedric? Are you alright? I'll get you some water."" She was still here. Of course, she was.

Kacie ignored her and steered Cedric toward the bedroom. She helped him onto the bed and then escaped into the bathroom, leaning against the cool marble of the counter, trying to catch her breath.

Suddenly, strong arms wrapped around her from behind. Cedric pressed his face into her neck, his breath hot against her skin.

""Kacie,"" he murmured, his lips finding hers. The k**s was clumsy, tasting of whiskey and regret. ""My wife.""

The word, which should have been a comfort, felt like another lie. But a desperate, foolish part of her still wanted to believe.

Her body trembled. ""Do you still want to marry me, Cedric?"" The question was a wh**per, fragile and full of fear.

He pulled back just enough to look at her. He cupped her face in his hands, his thumbs wiping away tears she hadn't realized were falling. He ki**ed her eyelids, her cheeks, her mouth.

""Yes,"" he said, his voice thick with emotion. ""Of course, I do. I want to give you the grandest wedding. I want us to have a child. A little girl who looks just like you.""

The dam inside her broke. She wrapped her arms around his neck, clinging to him. She was a vine, and he was the tree she had wrapped her entire, fragile life around. If he fell, she would shatter.

She let herself believe him. She let herself hope.

The next day, that hope felt like a cruel joke. His promises from the night before dissolved with the morning light. She remembered the cool, electronic voice that had sounded in her head the moment he ran out of the wedding reception yesterday. It was the voice of her internal clock, the harsh reality of her diagnosis. Three years, Kacie. Your time is running out.

""Cedric,"" she said, her voice carefully neutral as they sat at breakfast. ""I think it would be best if Jayden was transferred to another department.""

He didn't even hesitate. ""No.""

""Why not?""

""She' s my assistant. She does a good job. There' s no reason to move her.""

""She' s not just an assistant, and you know it. Everyone in the company whispers about you two. Your parents treat her like their daughter. She' s not just an employee, Cedric.""

He frowned, a familiar sign of his impatience. ""Don't be unreasonable, Kacie.""

He stood up, grabbing his pajamas, and went into the bathroom, shutting the door behind him. The argument was over. He had decided.

Kacie felt a familiar tightness in her ch**t. It was a pressure that had nothing to do with her heart condition and everything to do with him.

That night, when she went to bed, the lights were off. But the ceiling above her glowed with a soft, beautiful light. He had turned on the projector he'd installed, and the Rosette Nebula bloomed across the ceiling. It was breathtaking.

He slid into bed beside her, pulling her against his ch**t. ""I'm sorry about yesterday,"" he whispered. ""The wedding was a mess. I promise, I'll make it up to you. We' ll have another one, bigger and better than yesterday's.""

She looked into his eyes, saw the stars of the nebula reflected there, and her resolve softened. She was so tired of fighting. She just wanted to be loved.

""Okay,"" she whispered.

He leaned in to k**s her, but just as his lips were about to touch hers, his phone rang. The sound was harsh in the quiet room.

He pulled away to answer it. Kacie heard Jayden's voice on the other end, choked with sobs.

""Cedric... I just booked a flight back home.""

He sat up immediately, his voice sharp with alarm. ""What? Why? What happened?""

""Someone posted online... about you leaving the wedding for me,"" Jayden cried. ""They' re saying horrible things, calling me a homewrecker. I can' t take it, Cedric. I have to leave.""

Kacie felt his gaze on her, cold and assessing. The warmth from a moment ago vanished, replaced by an icy chill.

She met his eyes. ""You think I did it?""

He didn't answer her. He spoke into the phone, his voice gentle again. ""Don't cry, Jayden. Stay where you are. I'll handle it.""

He hung up and turned to Kacie, his face a mask of disappointment. ""Why would you do something so petty?""

The accusation hit her harder than she expected. ""It wasn't me.""

""Then who was it?""

""I don't know, but it wasn't me!""

He didn't believe her. She could see it in his eyes. He stood up and pulled her out of bed. ""Get dressed. We're going to the hospital.""

""What for?""

""You're going to apologize to Jayden. And we're going to live stream it to clear her name.""

""No,"" she said, pulling her arm away. ""I have nothing to apologize for.""

He grabbed her arm again, his grip tight. ""You're going to do this, Kacie. You owe her that much.""

He dragged her out of the house and to the car. The whole way to the hospital, she sat in silence, her heart a cold, heavy stone in her ch**t.

When they arrived, a cameraman was already waiting in Jayden's hospital room. Jayden herself was sitting up in bed, wearing a pretty dress, her makeup perfect, looking pale and fragile.

The moment she saw Cedric, her eyes filled with tears. ""Cedric,"" she whispered, then her gaze shifted to Kacie, and she flinched as if she were afraid.

""Kacie, don't scare her,"" Cedric said, his voice sharp. He moved to stand between them, his body a shield protecting Jayden from her.

The action was so automatic, so instinctual. He was protecting another woman from his own wife. The bitterness was so strong Kacie could taste it. She had never seen him protect anyone like that before. Not even her.


Chapter 3
""Start the stream,"" Cedric said to the cameraman.

Jayden faced the camera, tears rolling down her perfect cheeks. ""I just want to say... Cedric and I are like brother and sister. He left his wedding because he heard I was in a car accident. He was just worried about me. Please, don't misunderstand.""

Kacie watched the performance, feeling numb. ""A car accident? You don' t have a single scratch on you.""

Jayden' s composure faltered for a second. She looked helplessly at Cedric.

He stepped in immediately. ""She was cleared by the doctors, but she' s suffering from emotional distress. That' s why she' s here."" He looked directly at the camera. ""I'm warning everyone to stop these baseless rumors. If this continues, my legal team will take action.""

He signaled for the cameraman to stop the stream. The performance was over.

Jayden turned to Kacie, taking her hand. Her touch felt like ice. ""Kacie, I'm so sorry this happened. It' s all my fault.""

Kacie pulled her hand away and let out a dry, humorless laugh. ""No. It's my fault.""

She looked at Cedric. ""I was wrong. Wrong to trust you. Wrong to believe I could ever be enough for you.""

""I'm going home,"" she said, her voice flat.

""I'll take you,"" Cedric offered, a flicker of guilt in his eyes.

Just then, a nurse came in. ""Miss Moore, it's time for your bl**d test.""

Jayden immediately shrank back against the pillows. ""Oh, no. Cedric, you know I can't... I have a phobia of needles.""

Cedric hesitated, looking between Kacie and Jayden. The choice was clear on his face before he even made it.

Kacie didn' t wait for his decision. ""It's fine. I'll go by myself.""

She turned and walked out of the room. As the door swung shut behind her, she caught a final glimpse of Cedric, sitting on the edge of the bed, holding Jayden' s hand, comforting her.

Her heart felt numb. She couldn't tell if it was pain or just disappointment anymore. A final, crushing resignation.

She had to leave. Not just this hospital, but this life she had fought so hard for. She would disappear. Completely. No body, no trace. Just gone.

That evening was the first family dinner since the wedding. It was supposed to be a celebration. For Kacie, it felt like a funeral.

She walked in and saw them all in the living room. Burt and Carroll Moon were laughing with Jayden, who sat between them on the sofa. Cedric was kneeling on the floor in front of Jayden, massaging her calf.

""Oh, you're here,"" Carroll said when she saw Kacie. Her smile vanished. The warmth in the room dropped several degrees.

""Jayden was at the hospital all day for check-ups,"" Cedric explained, not looking up. ""Her leg is sore."" He glanced at Kacie. ""The elders are here. Don't make a scene.""

""I won't,"" Kacie said quietly.

At the dinner table, she was invisible. All the attention, all the conversation, all the affection was directed at Jayden. Cedric peeled shrimp and cracked crab claws for Jayden, placing the meat carefully on her plate. It was an act of care he used to reserve for Kacie.

She remembered the first time she had come to this house for dinner. The Moons had been polite but cold, their disapproval a tangible thing in the air. She had thought they were just stuffy, reserved people. Now she understood. They weren't cold. They were just cold to her.

She ate in silence, the food tasteless in her mouth, each bite a struggle. The pain in her ch**t was a dull, constant throb.

""Cedric, would you mind getting everyone some soup?"" Carroll asked, smiling at her son.

Kacie remembered a time when Cedric cooked fish soup just for her, telling her it was his secret family recipe.

Jayden pouted playfully. ""But Cedric, you promised that your famous fish soup was only for me.""

""This is chicken soup, silly,"" Cedric said patiently, his voice impossibly gentle. ""The fish soup is still just for you.""

That was it. That was the truth she had been avoiding. The casual, thoughtless intimacy, the gentle tone, the exclusive promises. That was his real love. The tenderness he showed Kacie was just a pale imitation.

""I'll get the soup for you, Kacie!"" Jayden said, standing up with a bright, false smile.

""I can get it,"" Kacie said, trying to stop her.

""It's no problem. I know my way around this house better than anyone,"" Jayden said, a clear declaration of her place here.

She went into the kitchen. The strong smell of fish broth wafted out, turning Kacie's stomach.

Jayden returned, carrying a single bowl. ""Did you know,"" she said, her voice low and meant only for Kacie, ""that Cedric and I had a childhood engagement? Our parents arranged it when we were kids.""

The words hit Kacie' s already bruised heart.

""Men's promises,"" Jayden added with a smirk, ""they're not worth much, are they?""

A sharp pain shot through Kacie' s ch**t. Acid rose in her throat.

""Are you okay, Kacie?"" Jayden asked, her expression one of mock concern. ""You should take the soup. Cedric is waiting.""

Kacie tried to refuse, to push the bowl away, but her hands were shaking. The hot soup sloshed over the side, spilling all over the front of her dress. But it wasn't Kacie who screamed.


Chapter 4
""Ah!"" Jayden cried, stumbling backward and collapsing onto the floor. She clutched her hand, which was perfectly fine, and sobbed as if in agony.

Cedric and his parents rushed into the kitchen. They saw Jayden on the floor, crying, and Kacie standing over her, her dress soaked with soup.

Kacie's body went rigid. ""It wasn't me,"" she whispered, shaking her head.

Jayden immediately came to her defense, her voice choked with fake tears. ""It was an accident! Kacie didn't mean it. Don't blame her.""

It was the most damning accusation possible.

""You wicked jinx!"" Carroll Moon shrieked, rushing to cradle Jayden. ""First a car crash, now this! What have you done to our Jayden?""

Burt Moon's gaze was like ice. ""Kacie, you are Mrs. Moon now. Try to act like it.""

Kacie looked past them, her eyes searching for Cedric's. This was her last hope. She needed him to believe her, just this once.

He wouldn't meet her eyes. He walked past her, knelt, and gently lifted Jayden into his arms. ""I'm taking you to the hospital,"" he said softly to Jayden, and carried her out of the kitchen without a single glance back.

Kacie watched him go, feeling him walk right out of her world. The last ember of hope inside her died, leaving only cold ash.

Later that night, back in their empty house, Kacie saw the red, angry burn on her stomach from the soup. She cleaned the wound herself, the physical pain a distant echo of the agony in her heart. Tears streamed down her face, silent and hot.

She heard the front door open. It was Jayden, wrapped in Cedric's expensive cashmere coat.

""Cedric said I could stay here for a few days,"" Jayden said, her voice small and timid. ""He was worried about me being alone.""

Cedric came in behind her, shielding her as if Kacie were a threat. ""Jayden was kind enough to bring you some takeout,"" he said, avoiding Kacie's eyes. ""She was worried you didn't eat.""

He placed a container of soup in front of her.

Kacie looked at it, then at him. ""I'm allergic to beans.""

Cedric looked surprised. He opened the container. The soup was full of soybeans. He had forgotten. Again.

""Oh, I'm so sorry!"" Jayden said, her hand flying to her mouth. ""I think I ate your portion by mistake. That one was meant for me.""

""It's fine,"" Cedric said quickly, already dismissing Kacie's needs. ""She won't mind. We can just order something else for her.""

Kacie looked at the two of them, a perfectly matched set of liars. The absurdity of it all made her want to laugh.

She turned and walked into the bedroom, shutting the door.

Hours passed. When Cedric finally came in, it wasn't to apologize.

""I know you don't like Jayden,"" he said, his voice hard. ""But you need to put aside your feelings. You'll apologize to her tomorrow and take care of her until she's better. Think of it as making up for what you did.""

Her stomach churned. Her lower abdomen ached with a dull, heavy pain. Her husband was bringing another woman into their home on their wedding night and ordering her to serve the woman.

A bitter sigh escaped her lips. She was done. She wouldn't spend the last of her precious time in this misery.

""Let's break up, Cedric.""

His face darkened. ""What did you say?""

""We're not legally married yet. We only had the ceremony. We're just boyfriend and girlfriend. And I'm breaking up with you.""

""What are you playing at, Kacie?"" he demanded, his voice rising in anger and confusion.

""Jayden told me about your childhood engagement.""

""That was just a joke between our parents! It meant nothing! She's my sister, that's all!""

""A sister?"" Kacie laughed, a hollow sound. ""You have female cousins, Cedric. You're so strict with them they're not even allowed to call you by your first name. But Jayden can sit on your desk, touch you, and you leave your own wedding for her. You let her stay in our house. The house you promised would only ever be for the two of us.""

Cedric flinched. He remembered the promise.

Kacie looked at him, her eyes empty of everything but disappointment. ""I have my principles, Cedric. I don't share my husband.""

He opened his mouth to speak, but a soft, whimpering sound came from the doorway. Jayden stood there, tears streaming down her face.

""Are you fighting because of me?"" she cried. ""I'm so sorry. I'll leave. I'll leave right now.""

She turned and ran, her sobs echoing in the silent house.

""Jayden!"" Cedric called out. He grabbed his car keys and, without a second glance at Kacie, ran after her.

The sound of the front door slamming shut was the sound of her heart breaking for the final time.


Chapter 5
Kacie lay alone on the bed, staring at the projected stars on the ceiling. They offered no comfort now, only a reminder of broken promises. The tears had run out. There was nothing left inside her but a vast, cold emptiness.

The next morning, she was woken by the sound of Cedric moving around the master suite closet. He was packing a suitcase.

""What are you doing?"" she asked, her voice raspy.

He didn't look at her. ""I found Jayden last night. She was distraught. Kacie, I can't let her go through this alone. I think it would be best if you moved into the old Moon family estate for a while. Just until Jayden feels better.""

Her breath caught in her throat. ""You want me to leave? So you and she can live here together?""

He finally looked at her, his eyes full of a weary frustration. ""The estate is too far for me to commute every day. Jayden needs me here. Can't you just be understanding for once?""

""No,"" she said, her voice flat. ""I want to break up.""

He threw the shirt he was holding onto the bed. ""Why are you so convinced there's something sordid between me and Jayden? She' s my responsibility!""

His anger was familiar. It reminded her of the man he was before he'd let her into his life, the cold, dismissive mogul who looked at her with disdain.

Then, his expression softened. He sat on the bed and pulled her into a hug. ""Kacie, please. Just give me a little more time. I promise I'll sort everything out. We'll go on that honeymoon trip, just the two of us. Anywhere you want to go.""

She didn't speak. She leaned against him, but it was just a body resting against another. Inside, she was already gone. When her time was up, he could have this house, his family, and his precious Jayden. It would have nothing to do with her.

""Alright,"" she said.

At breakfast, Jayden was already in the kitchen, humming as she set the table. She had prepared a full breakfast, acting every bit the lady of the house. She placed a bowl of seafood porridge in front of Kacie.

The fishy smell made Kacie feel ill. Cedric, however, ate with gusto, praising Jayden's cooking.

""So, Cedric, how is it?"" Jayden asked, batting her eyelashes.

""It's delicious,"" he said.

""Better than Kacie's?"" she asked, a sly smile on her face.

Cedric fell silent for a moment.

Jayden laughed lightly. ""I'm just kidding! Of course, Kacie is the best at everything. After all, you chose her. You felt you had to be responsible after you went into her room by mistake that night, right?""

Kacie's face went white. She looked at Cedric, who was sipping his milk, not denying a word.

Responsible. That's what he had said that morning. Not ""I want to be with you."" Not ""I have feelings for you."" Just, ""I'll take responsibility.""

Her great love story, the one she'd staked the last of her life on, was nothing more than a man's guilty conscience.

After breakfast, Jayden stood by the door, straightening Cedric's tie and brushing a piece of lint from his jacket. They looked like a normal married couple. Kacie was the intruder.

""Sorry, Kacie,"" Jayden said with a smug look. ""Force of habit from work.""

Cedric glanced at Kacie. Seeing her blank expression, he seemed to relax. He ki**ed her on the forehead. ""There's a company party tonight. I want you to come with me.""

""Okay,"" Kacie said.

As soon as they left, she walked through the house. Jayden's things were everywhere-her shoes by the door, her skincare products in the bathroom, her favorite mug next to the coffee machine. The home she had so carefully built with Cedric was no longer hers.

She picked up a silver picture frame from the mantelpiece. It was a photo of her and Cedric on the day he proposed. They both looked so happy. The sight of her own joyful, hopeful face was unbearable.

She threw the frame into the tr**h.

One by one, she gathered all her belongings. With each item that disappeared into a box, a little more of her attachment to this life, to him, vanished.

She would go to the party tonight. And then, she would disappear from his world forever. She would no longer be the obstacle standing between him and his real love.


Chapter 6
Kacie arrived at the hotel ballroom on time. The first thing she heard was the sound of Jayden crying.

She walked into the private dressing room Cedric had booked and saw the scene. Jayden was sobbing, and on the chair next to her was a beautiful evening gown, now splattered with red w**e and dirt.

Cedric' s face was dark with anger. ""Don't worry, Jayden. I'll find out who did this and make them pay."" He was already on the phone, arranging for a new dress to be delivered.

Kacie didn't want to be part of the drama. She picked up her own dress bag and turned to find a different room to change in.

""Wait,"" Jayden said, her eyes, red from crying, fixed on Kacie' s dress. ""Cedric, there' s no time to get a new one. The party is about to start."" She looked at Kacie. ""Kacie, could I please borrow your dress? Just for tonight.""

The dress Kacie had chosen was a deep blue, a perfect match for the sapphire suit Cedric was wearing. They were meant to look like a couple.

""Jayden, you're his assistant,"" Kacie said, her voice even. ""It wouldn't be appropriate for you to wear a dress that matches the CEO's suit.""

Jayden' s lower l*p trembled. ""But I' m his partner for the opening dance! If I don't look the part, it will reflect badly on the company. People will talk.""

Kacie felt a surge of weary frustration. ""That's not my responsibility.""

Before she could react, Cedric stepped forward and took the dress bag from her hands. He gave it to Jayden.

""This is an important event for the company, Kacie,"" he said, his voice firm. ""Jayden needs to look her best.""

Kacie stared at her empty hands. ""And what about me?""

The simple question hung in the air.

For the first time, Cedric seemed to truly see her. He saw the profound exhaustion in her eyes, the complete and utter disappointment. A strange, unfamiliar ache spread through his ch**t.

He reached into his pocket and pulled out a black velvet box. He opened it. Inside was a necklace, a stunning string of rubies that glowed like embers. It was the necklace Kacie had admired in a jewelry store window weeks ago.

""This is for you,"" he said, his voice softer now.

Her breath hitched. For a moment, she forgot everything. She reached out, her fingers hovering over the beautiful stones.

""Oh, how gorgeous!"" Jayden exclaimed, snatching the box from Cedric' s hand before Kacie could touch it. She clasped the necklace around her own neck. ""Cedric, how do I look?""

For the first time all evening, Cedric looked annoyed with Jayden. ""That' s not for you, Jayden. It's for Kacie.""

Jayden smiled sweetly at Kacie. ""Could I just borrow it for tonight, Kacie? Please? My dress is ruined, and I need something to make me look presentable. The reputation of the company is at stake.""

Cedric looked at Kacie, a silent plea in his eyes. He expected her to give in, to sacrifice her own feelings for the sake of his company, for the sake of Jayden.

Kacie slowly pulled her hand back. ""Let her wear it,"" she said, her voice devoid of emotion.

Cedric looked relieved. He took the necklace from Jayden, his fingers brushing her neck as he fastened the clasp for her.

""Does it look good?"" Jayden asked again, turning to him.

""It looks good,"" he said, his eyes on Kacie.

But she was already gone. He turned to see her walking out of the room.

""Kacie, where are you going?"" he called out.

""To a place where I belong,"" she said, without turning back.

An uneasy feeling settled in his stomach. He wanted to go after her, but the party was starting. Jayden was pulling on his arm, urging him toward the ballroom.

He took one last look at Kacie's retreating back, then suppressed the feeling of dread and turned away.


Chapter 7
The sound of the orchestra from the ballroom was a wave of noise that crashed against Kacie as she walked down the empty hallway. She felt a phantom pursuit, the weight of the last few years chasing her, and she quickened her pace.

Turning a corner, she collided with a heavyset man who reeked of whiskey.

""Watch where you're going!"" he slurred, grabbing her arm.

""I'm sorry,"" Kacie said, trying to pull away. ""I'll pay for your dry cleaning.""

The man's eyes roamed over her simple dress, a sneer on his face. ""Dry cleaning? You think that's enough? Get on your knees and wipe my shoes, and maybe I'll forgive you.""

Kacie' s eyes narrowed. ""No. Just tell me how much I owe you.""

He laughed, a harsh, ugly sound. ""You'll do as I say."" He started to drag her toward the ballroom doors. ""You think you're too good for me?""

""Let go of me,"" she said, her voice low and dangerous. ""I'm with Cedric Moon.""

The man laughed even harder. ""Cedric Moon? His wife is in there right now, dancing with him. You must be one of his wannabes.""

He pulled her to the entrance of the ballroom. Kacie looked inside. And there, in the center of the dance floor, was Cedric. He was dancing the opening waltz with Jayden.

Jayden was wearing a new dress, a brilliant scarlet one that shimmered under the lights. She was also wearing the ruby necklace. The one that was meant for Kacie. They were a stunning couple, a perfect match. They moved together gracefully, their eyes locked, smiles of pure happiness on their faces. They looked like they were the only two people in the world.

Any desire Kacie had to fight, to scream, to demand an explanation, died. What was the point? The truth was right there, dancing in front of her.

Slowly, deliberately, she knelt. She took the handkerchief from the man's br**st pocket and carefully wiped the spot of dirt from his polished leather shoe.

The waltz ended. Cedric' s eyes scanned the crowd, and then he saw her. He saw her on her knees at the feet of another man.

His face contorted with rage. He pushed through the crowd and, without a word, punched the drunk man squarely in the jaw. The man crumpled to the floor.

""How dare you?"" Cedric roared, standing over him. He then pulled Kacie to her feet and, ignoring the shocked stares of his guests, dragged her away.

In the elevator, his anger turned on her. ""Why didn't you call for me?"" he demanded, his voice low and furious.

Kacie looked at him, a bitter smile on her lips. ""I didn't want to interrupt your dance with the new 'Mrs. Moon'.""

""She was a last-minute replacement for the dance, Kacie. That's all.""

""Stop,"" she said, holding up a hand. ""Just... stop. I don't want to hear any more of your excuses."" She looked him in the eye. ""Why did you have my things cleared out of the house?""

He froze. An assistant had called him earlier, telling him Kacie had thrown away their wedding photo. He had assumed she was leaving him. In a fit of anger and hurt, he had ordered her things be put in storage.

""I'm leaving, Cedric,"" she said, her voice calm and final.

The elevator was silent.

He grabbed her wrist, his grip painfully tight. ""Don't play these games with me, Kacie.""

She had no words left.

The elevator doors were about to open on the ground floor when his phone rang again. It was his assistant, his voice frantic.

""Mr. Moon! It's Jayden! She's been kidnapped!""

Cedric's face went white. He grabbed Kacie and ran, not down, but up, toward the roof.

On the rooftop, a man held a kn**e to Jayden's throat. It was the drunk guest from the hallway.

""Moon!"" the man yelled. ""You humiliated me! Now you're going to pay!""

Cedric' s breath was ragged. ""Let her go. She has nothing to do with this."" He was trying to sound calm, but Kacie could feel the panic radiating from him.

""Nothing to do with this?"" the man laughed. ""Everyone knows she's the most important person in the world to you!""

""Cedric, help me!"" Jayden screamed.

Cedric took an involuntary step forward. The man pressed the kn**e harder against Jayden's skin. Cedric froze.

""What do you want?"" Cedric asked, his voice strained.

""I want you on your knees!"" the man snarled. ""And I want her,"" he said, pointing the kn**e at Kacie. ""Send your real wife over here in exchange for your little pet.""

Kacie felt Cedric' s hand loosen on hers. He looked at her, his eyes pleading. Then, he pushed her forward, toward the kidnapper.

""Please,"" Cedric begged, his voice breaking, directed not at the kidnapper, but at Kacie, or maybe the universe. ""Jayden can't get hurt. She can't.""

Then, for the second time that night, he got on his knees. Not for Kacie, but for Jayden.

The kidnapper laughed and released Jayden, who immediately ran into Cedric's waiting arms.

At the same time, the kidnapper lunged for Kacie. An arm wrapped around her neck, and a sharp blade pressed against her skin. She was dragged to the edge of the roof.

Suddenly, the rooftop door burst open, and police officers swarmed in.

The kidnapper holding Kacie panicked. She felt him raise the kn**e. Her last sight was of Cedric and Jayden, wrapped in a protective embrace.

Then she heard Cedric's voice, clear and decisive, ring out across the rooftop.

Ughh why is this gen so impatient !!!? Is it me or him?

 I was in kitchen making snacks and...
Then my bro after doin roaming around in papa's car cuz boys can easily storm out of house and go phuuuurrrrrrrr meanwhile girls (me) can't even shut the doors or even go somewhere to rejuvunate alone (no roof, no balcony, no garden cuz i feel like Everybody's watching and alwyas observing n JUDGING !! TT). 

Bro  honked THRICE (last two were on hold for WHOLE 4 SEC!!), 'I' (never my bro) ALWAYSS go running towards the main gate to open the door from all the way 20ms away from INSIDE THE house, while the lazy ass scumbag aristocrat who's lit JUST 3 meters away from the gate orders me around (gate is never locked from inside, and he has FOUR WORKING LIMBS!!). .. what am I!!? A peasant, who must listen to their feudal lord!!       I am HIS sister, I wish I was never born in such toxic patriarchial society, ughhh just 1 more year n I will keep a long physical distance from him...  Today, my hand was covered in the batter for sth so, it took me literally just 10 sec to wash it off roughly after hearing the first horn... I ran to the gate n reached there in just 20 sec after the first horn... Why is he so 
NOT-UNDERSTANDING!!?  He 

No matter how much majduri or laphanga u did ALL day long, YOU have NO RIGHTS to dominate w ur ego and make the other person feel 'less' deserving.


Ps: my house has 3 UNNECESSARY godowns (rooms) with only 1/3 space filled, while I have to live in the living room (on the couch, ugh no bed!!). 


Can't really focus/study well at day cuz of ANNOYING RELATIVES capture my so-called room ALL DAY LONG... and at night, my insomniac mum keeps snooping around my sleeping area at might to catch me using mobile (im up till 11 or 12 to do hw or just watch anime at peace, so then SHE has even more reasonings to justify her 'fugding annoying scooby doobiee orthodoxal code') n she wake me at 6 evry morning I HATE THISSS. I get ready for scl in JUST 10 mins (hair, ironed uniform, polished shoe, etc), so why does she want me to wake up 2 hours early while my bro SSSSLEEEEPS TILL 11 or 12 or 1!!!? Aien!!!! which logic is this?! Just cuz he's done w school doesn't mean he gets an upper hand!!



Ughh, as I'm writing this, he just slammed the door (ALWAYS DOES THISSS, I HATE IT) to the living room while leaving for another round of Acceptable unemployment SHITT (cuz my parents say 'a clg boy student doesn't have to pay rent to parents or even help out at home n he can live off like A LEACHH)... My bro is like 'handsome' acc to some blind love sick girls, BUt they need to know LOOKS are NOOTTT everything amd ppl fudging pretend to be nice while dating but they'll never KNOW THE TRUTH until yall live together....

My bro is like mid in academics (cuz parents nvr forced him or raised him to be an academic weapon) though he makes enough to live like a responsible adult through his other 'real world' skillzz... but idk, he MOST PROBS spends them in the dark stuff (idc how much my bro makes, idc why he eats 4 double patties burgers at once or alll the slices of one large pizza ALONE at MID nights!)... 

I CARE ABOUT why!!???  Why does his aura smells like a drug addict whose hair's aroma is engulfed w some kinda foreign hooka n heavily laid nicotine even after showering.

Why my bro could be dream guy for many girls (but actually my bro does not deserve them)?

1. Good height, attractive look (not intimidating at all) (look is not everything)
2. Fashion is not elegant but girls love bad boyzz
3. Funny (this is fake mann)
4. Sweet talking (even though this is totally fake but my bro is really a prof liar. Trust girls CAN NOT TELL HIM APART FROM good person on surface,  ur gut doesn't ALWAYS TELLS the truth)
5. Academics is kk, avg
6. Aesthetically pleasing social media page (he fudging sucks irl, at least i k his true self)
7. Caring, will check up on u (he doesn'tcheck up on me cuz i have no good enough clothes (im saying this fr, my parents barely buy me anything n orthodoxal af) to even go out w someone)
8. He can't do the BASIC house chores properly

At the very end, be very careful!!

1. if you are a person with strong ethical n moral values n belief, then plz dump him!! I don't want you to ruin ur life for a scum bag. What he has is not just a habitual problem, IT IS A MORAL ISSUE and ACCEPT the fact that you cannot and do not have to build ur mann... You deserve better

2. If you r just another lowlife like my bro, please leave him, ur just ruining ur opportunity to live a better life... I hope u do better in life

3. Someone who showers 3 times a day doesn't always mean he's hygienic!! Look whether he dries his clothes or towels himself. Notice whether he makes his bed or not. Notice how often he makes a decision for a better n healthy lifestyle (cuz if he gets sick as a consequenceof his OWN UNTHOUGHTFUL DECISION, then he's just there to give u a TRAUMA of losing close one). Notice whether he puts all the utensils back at the dishwasher or the dryer after using them. Notice whether he closes the lid well after opening it. Notice whether he cleans after himself after a mea

4. Having common Interests ‚â† having better dating life...
Just cuz u both like going to collect cars, cards, bags, antiques, etc... just cuz u both can talk about ur interest for hr doesn't mean better dating experience. REMEMBER: someone w interest but no will to take an action or initiative, will never be able to keep u happy lifelong.

5. See how he treats his sister or parents (hell 100% pretend, have one on one w his sister)

6. If you still decide eto be w him,remember that even if he has a lot of money, it doesn't last forever n ull either divorce him later on will stay as a housewife or should I say more of a nany cuz you will have to wash his clothes, pick his left-over meal of plate left in the dinning table, trust me he'll not even make you anything in life other than cup noodle or boring coffee. He cooks really bad.

I hope you find a better partner n may be just leave a better impact on my lazyass broo


TLDR: Warning to my brother's gf: he will seem perfect bf to u but ull only know the truth  once u live w him. beware of his entitled, lazy, and inconsiderate behavior. He expects others to cater to him, doesn't help out, and has poor lifestyle (health, food, workouts) habits. Look beyond his surface-level charm and consider whether you deserve better.

1o4mjme,https://www.reddit.com/r/ContentCreators/comments/1o4mjme/went_from_300_views_to_50k_by_fixing_these_7/,Went from 300 views to 50k by fixing these 7 things,"I've been putting ridiculous hours into short form video for almost a year now. Like genuinely unhealthy amounts of time. Entire weekends breaking down viral videos, rewriting hooks twenty different ways, testing every editing technique I could find, the whole obsessive creator thing.

Why? Because I genuinely believe if you can't capture attention in 20 seconds you might as well not exist online. Doesn't matter what you're trying to build or say or sell. If people scroll past you're invisible.

But here's what was destroying me. I was doing the work every single day and getting nowhere. I'd spend half a day perfecting one video just to watch it flatline at 280 views. Tried every tactic people swear by. Followed frameworks from successful creators. Bought into the guru advice. Still completely stuck.

Started genuinely believing maybe I just don't have whatever it takes. Like maybe some people are naturally built for this and I'm not one of them. Maybe there's some instinct other creators have that I'm missing entirely.

Then I had this realization. I wasn't failing because I wasn't trying hard enough. I was failing because I was creating completely blind. All that effort meant nothing because I had zero visibility into what was actually wrong. Just posting and hoping something would randomly work.

So I stopped following random advice and started tracking real patterns. Went back through about 45 of my worst videos and analyzed them like I was seeing them for the first time. Wrote down every moment where I lost interest or wanted to scroll. Started seeing the same mistakes repeating over and over.

Here's what I found was killing my content without me realizing:

**Vague hooks are basically invisible.**¬†Lines like ""wait for this"" or ""you need to see this"" get skipped instantly because literally everyone uses them. But ""I stopped drinking coffee for 40 days and my hands wouldn't stop shaking"" actually stops the scroll. Being specific always wins over being mysterious.

**Second 5 is your real make or break moment.**¬†Most viewers decide between seconds 4 and 7 if your content is worth watching. I was building tension slowly like I was directing a short film. Now I put my strongest moment right at second 5. That's where you actually prove you're worth their time.

**Pauses that feel normal to you feel like dead time to viewers.**¬†Any gap longer than about 1 second reads as boring when people are scrolling fast. If nothing happens for even 1.5 seconds they assume the video froze and leave. You have to cut way tighter than feels comfortable.

**Visual sameness kills attention fast.**¬†If your video looks the same for more than 3 seconds people's brains check out. Started constantly switching angles, cutting to different shots, repositioning text, anything to create visual variety. My retention at the halfway point jumped from 38% to 63%.

**Over editing can actually hurt you.**¬†Videos I spent 5 hours on with perfect transitions and color grading would die. Videos I threw together quickly would randomly blow up. Overly polished content looks like an ad so people automatically scroll. Raw and authentic beats perfect production most of the time.

**Bad audio makes people leave without knowing why.**¬†Any hum or volume jump or echo creates subconscious discomfort. Your audio needs to be clean or viewers feel like something's wrong and bail even if they can't identify what it is.

**Getting people to rewatch matters more than initial views**. Content people watch twice gets pushed way harder by algorithms. Started adding fast text you can miss, quicker cuts, small details you only notice on second viewing. My rewatch rate went from 11% to 27% and my reach exploded.

The actual breakthrough wasn't just learning this stuff though. It was finding an app that analyzes all of this before you post so you stop guessing what's wrong. It shows exactly where retention drops, rates how strong your hook is, catches pacing issues and audio problems, tells you specifically what needs fixing. Like having someone who's studied thousands of viral videos review yours before it goes live.

That's when my numbers actually changed. Went from stuck at 300 views to consistently hitting 7k to 10k within a few weeks. Not because my content magically got better but because I could finally see what was broken and fix it.

If your videos keep dying under 500 views it's probably not because you're bad at this. It's because you're posting blind like I was. Making the same unfixable mistakes because you can't see them.

I'm putting this out there because I really wish someone had explained this to me 8 months ago. Would've saved me a lot of frustration and doubt. If you're in that spot right now maybe this helps.

Like genuinely unhealthy amounts of time. Entire weekends breaking down viral videos, rewriting hooks twenty different ways, testing every editing technique I could find, the whole obsessive creator thing.

Why? Because I genuinely believe if you can't capture attention in 20 seconds you might as well not exist online. Doesn't matter what you're trying to build or say or sell. If people scroll past you're invisible.

But here's what was destroying me. I was doing the work every single day and getting nowhere. I'd spend half a day perfecting one video just to watch it flatline at 280 views. Tried every tactic people swear by. Followed frameworks from successful creators. Bought into the guru advice. Still completely stuck.

Started genuinely believing maybe I just don't have whatever it takes. Like maybe some people are naturally built for this and I'm not one of them. Maybe there's some instinct other creators have that I'm missing entirely.

Then I had this realization. I wasn't failing because I wasn't trying hard enough. I was failing because I was creating completely blind. All that effort meant nothing because I had zero visibility into what was actually wrong. Just posting and hoping something would randomly work.

So I stopped following random advice and started tracking real patterns. Went back through about 45 of my worst videos and analyzed them like I was seeing them for the first time. Wrote down every moment where I lost interest or wanted to scroll. Started seeing the same mistakes repeating over and over.

Here's what I found was killing my content without me realizing:

**Vague hooks are basically invisible.** Lines like ""wait for this"" or ""you need to see this"" get skipped instantly because literally everyone uses them. But ""I stopped drinking coffee for 40 days and my hands wouldn't stop shaking"" actually stops the scroll. Being specific always wins over being mysterious.

**Second 5 is your real make or break moment.** Most viewers decide between seconds 4 and 7 if your content is worth watching. I was building tension slowly like I was directing a short film. Now I put my strongest moment right at second 5. That's where you actually prove you're worth their time.

**Pauses that feel normal to you feel like dead time to viewers.** Any gap longer than about 1 second reads as boring when people are scrolling fast. If nothing happens for even 1.5 seconds they assume the video froze and leave. You have to cut way tighter than feels comfortable.

**Visual sameness kills attention fast.** If your video looks the same for more than 3 seconds people's brains check out. Started constantly switching angles, cutting to different shots, repositioning text, anything to create visual variety. My retention at the halfway point jumped from 38% to 63%.

**Over editing can actually hurt you.** Videos I spent 5 hours on with perfect transitions and color grading would die. Videos I threw together quickly would randomly blow up. Overly polished content looks like an ad so people automatically scroll. Raw and authentic beats perfect production most of the time.

**Bad audio makes people leave without knowing why.** Any hum or volume jump or echo creates subconscious discomfort. Your audio needs to be clean or viewers feel like something's wrong and bail even if they can't identify what it is.

**Getting people to rewatch matters more than initial views**. Content people watch twice gets pushed way harder by algorithms. Started adding fast text you can miss, quicker cuts, small details you only notice on second viewing. My rewatch rate went from 11% to 27% and my reach exploded.

The actual breakthrough wasn't just learning this stuff though. It was finding an app that analyzes all of this before you post so you stop guessing what's wrong. It shows exactly where retention drops, rates how strong your hook is, catches pacing issues and audio problems, tells you specifically what needs fixing. Like having someone who's studied thousands of viral videos review yours before it goes live.

That's when my numbers actually changed. Went from stuck at 300 views to consistently hitting 7k to 10k within a few weeks. Not because my content magically got better but because I could finally see what was broken and fix it.

If your videos keep dying under 500 views it's probably not because you're bad at this. It's because you're posting blind like I was. Making the same unfixable mistakes because you can't see them.

I'm putting this out there because I really wish someone had explained this to me 8 months ago. Would've saved me a lot of frustration and doubt. If you're in that spot right now maybe this helps.

I won‚Äôt say it‚Äôs a light cigar the likes of say a PLPC but in this case my fears didn‚Äôt come to fruition. 

Initially the cigar felt the driest of any of the Cubans that I‚Äôve had so far, and the wrapper felt kind of on the thin side. The cold draw wasn‚Äôt plugged but wasn‚Äôt the smoothest either. With some trepidation, I went in.

The first third opened up with coffee notes, but not like the coffee bomb I experienced with the RASS - a more gentle flavour with a hint of vanilla somewhere in there. For someone that isn‚Äôt a coffee fan, this was acceptable.

The second third abruptly pivoted into a barley flavour, paired with Ovaltine - not the milk powder, but those Ovalteenies we used to get in little packs as kids. 

Into the final third and another sudden change, this time leaning more into chocolate and cake spices, with occasional notes of milk - not cream, but milk. 

After the first few puffs the draw opened up nicely. The burn had a few niggling issues butI‚Äôd put those more down to operator error. Unfortunately when it got down to a little over the final inch it just didn‚Äôt want to stay lit anymore, even with a clear draw, so nubbing it would have meant too much effort keeping it going to be enjoyable.

As it is, I still think it‚Äôs a little on the heavy side for me, but if I‚Äôd come better prepped e.g. having had a heavier meal beforehand, I would find a time and place for it. I‚Äôm not sure on the box date but I think 3-5 years on it would soften those heavier notes, bring forward the softer notes, and make it smoother and outstanding.

Pero lately sobrang stress na po ako kasi hindi ko na alam pano makkapag boost pa ng sales. Sa area po namin, merong snackbar (may coffee din sila) Kapehan (powder lang yung gamit nila) And yung cousin ko 2 mos ago nag open up sila ng coffeeshop dun din samin. Yung price ko po from 89-115 lang..

Minsan gusto ko na po talaga sumuko. kaya lang pag gnun na napfeel ko biglang meron magllift up sakin. Kaya Kahit pano nabubuhayan ako ng loob. Minsan 5hrs na pero wala pa din benta. tapos nagddasal na lang ako kahit 1 cup lang okay na ko .. kahit 1 box lang ng mini donuts. Yung dapat til 12am lang inaabot ako ng 2am kasi umaasa pa din ako meron bibili or meron pang bibili.. (itong last two months po hindi na ko nazezero pero minsan walang drinks.. sandwich/donuts lang..

Minsan ang lungkot pag yung meron kang kilala na dadaanan ka lang.. tapos tinatry nila itago yung coffee na binili sa iba. (Iniisip ko na lang na, hindi naman tlaga lahat ng customer pipiliin ka. Or hindi lahat ng kaibigan/kakilala mo susuportahan ka)

Marami din nagaadvice sakin na kumuha na lang daw ako ng pwesto or dun na lang din daw ako sa may kanto namin (like sa cousin ko pero sa kabilang side sila) kasi may potential daw ako at yung coffeeshop ko nagttaka pa nga yung iba ba't daw mura e masarap naman daw. Kaso hindi pa po kasi tlga afford magbayad ng rent. Nappaikot ko pa lang kasi yung puhunan & meron na nadadagdag sa menu kahit pano.

Yung iba naman hindi daw kasi sila coffeelover/nagkkape talaga kaya gsto nila sana yung mga frappe Kaso nagiipon pa ko pambili ng blender.

Minsan hindi po ako sure if mukha ba ko masungit or nahihiya lang silang lumapit..

I've probably brewed 10 cups so far. The range of grind size recommendations on other [posts](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/wkq1vu/kingrinder_k6_grind_settings/) kind of blows my mind - basically everything from 60-120 clicks gets recommended. Im sure recipes and calibration point from zero account for some of this, but its such a large range. Seems like my 'true zero' is at -10 clicks.
 
So far I've tried everything from 75-100 clicks. Most cups are tasting weak/sour and I'm currently trending finer on the grind size. [Kingrinders official rec](https://www.kingrinder.com/blog/gs-exterior) is 90-120 clicks for pour over, which might be suitable for some recipes but my brews closer to 100 grind tasted way too weak/sour.

I started with a washed Ethiopian which I realized was maybe the worst possible choice for a hand grinder noob lol. I've since switched to a bag of Rogue Wave Columbian while I keep trying to dial in my cups. I use Third wave water, have the Origami, V60 and Switch brewers, and tend to use either the Scott Rao 2 pour recipe or Coffee Chronicler for the Switch.

I think my best cup so far was a 20g/320ml, 94C water temp, Coffee Chronicler Switch with an 80 grind, which resulted in a 2:45 drawdown (fairly muddy bed), but it still tasted weak/sour. My intuition is to keep grinding finer based on the flavors I'm getting, and stick with the Hario Switch until I figure this out.

Any tips for a K6 noob? I've heard that hand grinders need to season, could that really be accounting for the poor cups I've made so far?

Am I still sane?,"Have you ever asked yourself, ""Am I perfectly sane?"" or ""Am I seeing everything clearly?"" or maybe even ""Did I leave that door open?""

I have had to cut the people out of my life, the ones that don't believe me. The ones that don't believe the dreams I had and the things I have seen. I have always considered myself sane, sane, sane as can be. A perfectly normal, happy, can-do hard-working individual that has common sense - has reason - can distinguish reality from fiction. More and more I question if I truly have gone mad, or if it is all true. I wish I could just peel the answer off like a band-aid and just have it over with, but it is not so.

I suppose I should stop blathering on and get to it.

I've been having these dreams for about five months now. At first it was just I wake up in my bed, in my room, and go about my life like it was normal - but then I would wake up in reality and be confused why it was the same day - why the milk was still left in the fridge - why the coffee machine was still broken. I didn't understand.

Then it got weirder.

When I would go about my day - my day in the dreams - the world was empty of people. Cars left in park on the road, shops open with no one in them, and just the absence of any human noise. These dreams felt like they would last for hours or sometimes days. When I would wake up I would recall the past few days I spent in my dream, but I wake up and it's the morning again, and I realise it wasn't real. Again, I was just confused and brought it down to being just weird dreams.

Then, can you believe, it got stranger?

I would wake up, again, in my room and in my bed, but there would always be someone at the door, knocking. The first time I felt so startled I put a chair in front of it,  the person still knocking as I stayed in the room for what felt like days. But one time, I decided to open it. Looking at me, was myself, with a stupid, forced grin and bulging, glistening eyes that stared at me. It looked like it was crying. As you can imagine, again, the first time I was terrified and ran away, the thing following slowly like a shitty Michael Myers. After, God, maybe a week, I decided to speak to it.

""Hello? You good?""

And when it opened its mouth and was about to speak, I would wake up. I tried and tried, but I would still wake up. The next time I just opened the door and stared at it, but it was unwavering. Eventually, just to see what would happen, I touched it. It felt solid - felt real - but again, it just stood there, eyes bulging out and mouth stretched wide. I thought maybe it was some sort of sign - you know - that maybe in reality I was actually pretending to be happy but on the inside I was fucked up? I didn't know. How could I have known?

And could you believe it, it got even weirder?

The next time I woke up in the dream bed, same dream room, the thing was standing directly next to me, just looking down at me. I didn't know why, but I didn't feel scared even when it reached out and its fingers wrapped around my head, up my nose, down my throat and into my eyes. It plucked them out - without any pain - as without my eyes I heard bones breaking, flesh wriggling and the entire feeling of something stretching my mouth open wide and crawling into me. Then I could see again, after what felt like ages, and the thing was gone. I went about whatever dream bullshit I would usually do, this time again with people, before I would wake up.

And everything was normal, perfectly, perfectly normal after that. I would wake up, and always be very, very happy. I had to cut the people out of my life because they didn't understand. They couldn't comprehend that I am beautiful, I am perfect and I am amazing. They couldn't understand I had to leave part of myself behind. They couldn't imagine the possiblity I am a new person - I am reborn.

But the perfectly normal, perfectly odd thing, is that, when I dream, I dream of someone knocking at my door, calling out to me.",1,1760267089.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

Hiii 

I‚Äôm 26, trans, plus-sized, about 170 cm tall, currently living in Incheon. I moved here not too long ago and I‚Äôve been trying to find people who are kind, easy to talk to, and actually mean what they say. Life here can feel a little isolating when you‚Äôre on your own, and I‚Äôd love to meet someone who can break that pattern with genuine connection whether casual, platonic or more.
A bit about me: I love late-night walks, coffee shop people-watching, watching movies under a blanket, and having long, wandering conversations about anything from music to life to random philosophy. I‚Äôm pretty emotionally aware and direct once I‚Äôm comfortable honesty and warmth mean a lot to me. Humor too. I laugh at bad puns and I don‚Äôt mind being teased playfully as long as it‚Äôs kind.

I‚Äôm obviously not for everyone. But if you value softness and emotional literacy we might get along better than you think.  Ideally you‚Äôre around your 20s or 30s, based in Korea (or visiting often), open-minded, stable, and able to hold a conversation that‚Äôs more than small talk, match energy, share stories etc

Name?

Big Brother Corporation, or B Corp for short. The first draft had an idea of sugarcoating it in Japanese like ""Onii-San Corporation"", but Big Brother rolls off the tongue too well for me.

Gender Ratio? 

50:50, an all-female cast ""would cater too much into the whole Girlfriend Experience"", and as glorious CEO and Ringleader, i need the viewers to know each and every one of these talents belong to ME, they get MY headpats, MY praise, MY approval to be on the big stage, MY money. One Vtuber Debut at a time though, so at one point B Corp would be 100% female talents. What a nightmare that'd be. Don't be suprised if i rigged the scale with femboys.

Overall quality of Contracts?

Honestly i can't say too much, i don't know any VTubers that have legally leaked contracts to base off what percentage of their money is meant to be split between us. Though, paying my VTubers properly would be my top priority company-wise, because they're here for the money. All of that talk about ""You need to show off your passion in your auditions!"" is too corporatizing for me, the biggest passion we will give you is the vested rank of a being who supports and contributes to Big Brother Corporation, and it will be the biggest passion you will receive in your life. If needed, said contracts might include a yearly coffee date with the CEO. Just for good measure.

VTuber designs?

When someone auditions for B Corp, they get to choose their face and stage name, and we give them a company-issued uniform, their own special title, and a big stage to flaunt their talent to the masses; You. I have about... 13 basic outfit concepts for 13 talents, though with 6 of them being differently colored sweater variants. Said titles include ""Verse 1 - The Cadaver"", ""Verse 3 - The Godmother"", ""Archvile"", ""Kareena"", ""Paige"", ""Sonya"", ""Karma"", ""Verse 5 - The Tempest"", ""Verse 7 - The Umbrellade"", ""Verse 11 - The World"", ""Verse 13 - The Lost"", and ""Verse 20 - The Lord"". For your information, ""The Godmother"" will be given to a male and ""The Lord"" will be given to a female.

Said company-issued titles will much to your dismay, be fully covered and buttoned up. But be not afraid, because to my worries i will be making one talent uniform be made specifically for goonerbait, with parasociality, ASMR, and everything else that makes it right. Big boobs with tight tank top? Yes. ""PLEASE JUST GIVE US ANY AMOUNT OF CLEAVAGE?!?!?!?"" No, fuck you.

If you have any comments or thoughts on this, feel free to ask and you may leave your mark on the face of B Corp's legacy.

 ""Big Brother may not last for many generations to come, but as long as you live within the glorious Epoche of the Big Brother, all will be made for your life to be another dream in a red chamber. Never forget, Big Brother will always be watching.""",0,1760266625.0,VirtualYoutubers,1,0.25,False

I'm having issues with my Flair Signature. I've been using it on and off for 2 years and I've always had sour shots from it. 3 months ago I bought a 1zpresso J ultra thinking I'd be able to dial it in better (I was using a baratza encore esp before). Yet all my shots end up sour. I can reduce the sourness but never eliminate it. I've tried going finer and finer until it chokes, it's less and less sour but still sour. I don't taste bitterness. Can anyone help me fix my shot? Is the flair signature able to pull medium to light roasts?
Thanks!

My process : 
Heat management: 
Steaming the brew chamber and basket over my kettle while I grind and prepare the basket. At the end it is too hot to touch without a towel. I try to minimize the time spend losing heat between steaming and pulling. Water at 100¬∞C.

Coffee: 
Medium roast mainly, maybe a bit light but not too light. Currently using an Ethiopian Heirloom from Sidama.

Dose & ratio:
I'm using 12g to 13g and aim for 34g+ out (trying to reduce sourness by using longer ratios). It's the Flair Classic basket so I can fit a bit more but then the sourness is more present.

Grind setting:
0.8.5 on the J ultra. It chokes at 0.7.8 (1 min and 56 sec pull !). 

Time:
10 seconds pre infusion (at 2 bars) and total time between 40 seconds and 55 seconds depending on the grind size. (Pull at 9 bars).

Distribution:
Maybe the only thing I didn't optimize as much. I have a cork with guitar strings that is kind of messy but seems to work (no channeling and the bed seems evenly saturated for what I can see from under the portafilter). Sometimes I don't use it and scarsely get channeling. Then I tap the basket two times to level it out and then tamp.",1,1760266484.0,FlairEspresso,1,1.0,False

Alright, friends! Let‚Äôs dive deep into the wild world of side hustles. You ever get that burning desire to turn your passions into profits? I mean, who doesn‚Äôt want to kick back on a beach while the cash just... rolls in? But with the rapid rise of AI, opportunities are flying at us faster than your latest TikTok scroll! ü§Ø  

**So, what‚Äôs the deal? How do we turn those side hustles into goldmines?** Here are a few strategies I‚Äôve been tinkering with that you maybe should try out too:

- **Content Creation with AI**: ü§ñ  
  If you‚Äôre into content creation, AI tools can help you churn out quality articles, social media posts, and even scripts in a snap! Imagine having a virtual assistant that never complains about coffee breaks! Use platforms like Jasper or Copy.ai to help brainstorm blog ideas or create engaging newsletters. You‚Äôll find yourself juggling more projects than you thought possible!

- **Online Courses & Webinars**: üìö  
  Got expertise? Share it! Create online courses using platforms like Teachable or Udemy. AI can streamline the process‚Äîthink course outlines, quizzes, even grading! You could be sipping coffee while an algorithm does the heavy lifting. Just be ready for those ""Is this really worth my money?"" questions! Spoiler: it is!

- **E-commerce with AI-Powered Market Research**: üõí  
  Want to know what everyone is buying? AI can scour through data faster than you can say ""open cart."" Use tools like Jungle Scout or SEMrush to analyze trends. This insight means you‚Äôll know not just *what* to sell, but *who* will buy it! You could seriously have the next viral product on your hands without even lifting a finger!  

- **Freelancing & Gig Economy**: üíº  
  Connect with clients from all corners of the globe! Platforms like Fiverr and Upwork are your playground. Combine your skills with AI tools like Notion to organize tasks or Grammarly to polish up your proposals. Soon, you'll be juggling gigs‚Äîfrom graphic design to consulting‚Äîlike a circus performer on a unicycle, and who wouldn‚Äôt want that?  

- **Automated Social Media Management**: üì±  
  Content dropping at peak hours while you binge-watch your latest fave series? Yes, please! AI tools like Buffer help schedule posts, analyze engagement, and even suggest the best times to post! Less time on the grind means more time for Netflix‚Äîsounds like a win-win to me!  

**Now, what‚Äôs stopping you?** You might be thinking:
- ‚ÄúSounds too good to be true?‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not tech-savvy enough!‚Äù  
- ‚ÄúI only have a few hours a week‚Ä¶‚Äù  
Pssshhh! Everyone has to start somewhere. Trust me, even the pros were once clueless newbies! It‚Äôs all about learning as you go.  

Some days it'll feel tough like you're running uphill with a snowball, and other days you‚Äôll be soaring on a plane made of dollar bills. (Okay, not literally, but you get it!) The key? Don‚Äôt shy away from experimenting. Trial and error are your best friends.  

**So, share your personal stories‚Äîhave you tried any of these strategies? What worked for you, and what totally flopped?** Let's brainstorm together and turn those ideas into golden opportunities before the clock strikes 2025! ‚è≥üí•",1,1760266474.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

Baby formula distribution program

Hello Portland! I‚Äôm brainstorming putting together some type of neighborhood baby formula (food) distribution mutual aid in the area. With SNAP and WIC benefits weakening I‚Äôd like to support the mothers, parents, caregivers, and young babies here in Portland. 

Idea: pooled funds, neighborhood specific distribution points
Each neighborhood needs at least one point of contact and a few distribution volunteers to deliver formula/food when needed. Signs and donations baskets are placed in neighborhood coffee shops/stores. Signs would explain the mutual aid, have donations and inquire QR codes, and let caregivers know they can take from the basket or inquire with neighborhood POC, no questions asked. 

My questions: would enough people be interested in volunteering their time to their neighborhoods? Would one time donations be enough to establish and maintain the work or would recurring contributions be more effective? What monetary donation websites/companies are ethical, have recurring contributions options, and allow longstanding fund raising? Would allowing people to donate physical containers of baby formula/food cause concern for theft? (Should I really be concerned about people who don‚Äôt need the items taking the items?) Would coffee shops/stores be willing to collect cash and/or formula/food donations? Is there a program already like this?

I‚Äôm open to other ideas, questions, answers to my questions, and comments! Please DM if you are interested in collaborating or volunteering your time üçº ",0,1760265949.0,PortlandOR,1,0.33,False

But it can be daunting if tasked with organising or holding one yourself. So we have compiled this ultimate guide to help you plan and throw the perfect baby shower. This includes;

* Guest Lists
* Budget
* Venue
* Baby shower registry
* Themes
* Food and catering
* Decorations
* Furniture and Utensils
* Gifts and Present Opening
* Games
* What to wear
* Baby Shower Alternatives

Before we get started, you may have some questions about baby showers, so let‚Äôs get them out of the way first.

**What is a baby shower and when is it held?**  
A baby shower is a party where family and friends gather to celebrate an upcoming birth. It normally takes place between 26 and 34 weeks and goes for 2 to 3 hours.

**What happens at a baby shower?**  
At a baby shower, people celebrate the pregnancy and soon-to-be arrival of the baby. The venue is decorated, drinks and food is served and games are played. Gifts are given to help ease the expense of raising a baby.

**Who is supposed to organise a baby shower?**  
A baby shower is normally held by a close friend or family member. The parents¬†[shouldn‚Äôt organise the baby shower](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/organising-and-paying-for-a-baby-shower/)¬†themselves. Otherwise, it appears to be a gift-grabbing exercise.

Guest List

When deciding who to invite you should consider the following;

* Who to invite ‚Äì Who you invite is up to you. It‚Äôs your shower so you get the final say. Guests could include family, work colleagues, partners friends, and your circle of friends.
* How many people should attend- The number of people you invite will depend on a few things. Including your budget and the size of the venue. Also your personal choice. You may want to have a small celebration while others may want an extravagant party.
* Mixed sex or women-only event ‚Äì Traditionally, the guests at a baby shower have been women only. Yet more and more couples choose to have both men and women attend.

# Budget

The budget for your celebration will depend on how much you want to spend. A typical baby shower can range from a few hundred dollars to thousands. The major expenses will be your venue hire, catering and decorations. We go into further details on each of these below.

# Baby Shower Venue

There are a wide variety of choices when selecting a¬†[baby shower venue](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/baby-shower-venues-perth/). Below we have outlined some of the options and their pros and cons.

* Home ‚Äì A simple way to hold a baby shower is by having it in your house. You can cater yourself or get an outside caterer to come in. You can decorate how you like and make as much noise (within reason) as you wish. And you don‚Äôt have to worry about the time of year and the weather. The only downside is having lots of people in your house and the clean-up afterwards.
* Park ‚Äì This can be a simple yet beautiful venue to have a baby shower. Especially if the weather is nice. It‚Äôs an ideal venue if it is going to be a mixed-sex party. Lots of parks these days have BBQ‚Äôs but decorations will need to be kept to a minimum. The cost should be free depending on the park you choose but check with your local council.
* Hall ‚Äì This is my favourite idea and is very popular. The cost of hiring a hall is around the $150 mark, and most have a basic kitchen for you to bring food and heat up. Therefore reducing the catering cost. You can decorate the hall as much as you want and have all the space to yourself. The main downfall is you have a specific hire time, so your party will have to finish on time (Which could be a good thing). Also, you will have to clean up properly otherwise you won‚Äôt receive your bond back.
* Restaurant ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt mind spending the money and have a smaller guest list, a restaurant could be an ideal venue. The major benefits are not having to provide food and no cleaning up. The negatives are the cost and you don‚Äôt have the space to yourselves. Therefore missing out on baby shower traditions like playing games.
* Virtually ‚Äì Virtual baby showers became popular due to the outbreak of COVID-19. And people still like this idea so they can include people from around the world and other cities.
* Beach ‚Äì Like any outdoor event, you are at the mercy of the weather. But if that doesn‚Äôt worry you and you don‚Äôt mind sharing the space with the beach is a great venue. It can be a relaxed atmosphere where people can go for a swim and sit and chat easily. The cost is free at most beaches but in some areas, you may have to book with the council. Parking can also be a hassle, especially on nice days.
* BBQ ‚Äì A simple way to celebrate is by having a BBQ. Perfect as a mixed event and low cost as you can have it at a house, beach or park.

# Baby shower registry

People will want to get you a gift to celebrate the upcoming arrival of your baby. To make it easier you may opt for a¬†[baby shower registry](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/baby-shower-registry/). This is a list held by a company that provides items you would like to receive at your baby shower. It normally comprises of products that will help with bringing up the baby in the early years.

It is common for baby stores and large department stores to offer the registry service. However, my favourite registry is¬†[babylist](https://www.babylist.com/). This is where you select your favourite products from different stores and have them on a single register. For example, you can add a¬†[newborn swaddle](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/perth-swaddles/)¬†from us, a¬†[pram from Redsbaby](https://www.redsbaby.com.au/), and a¬†[zippy from bonds](https://www.bonds.com.au/baby/zippys.html). All in the one list. I prefer this as you are not tied to the selection of one shop.

# Themes

You may want to spice up your baby shower by adding a theme. The options are endless and only limited by your imagination. Below we some of the more popular suggestions;

* Animals ‚Äì Think elephants, jungle, whales, sheep, dinosaurs, unicorns and horse themes.
* Outdoors ‚Äì If you are an outdoors kind of person your theme could be about camping, woodlands, forest or a beach theme.
* Sports ‚Äì From car racing to golf, football to netball, a sports-themed baby shower is bound to be a hit.
* Movies, Music, and Books ‚Äì You could choose some of the classics like Star Wars, The Very Hungry Caterpillar, twinkle twinkle little star. Or some 80‚Äôs music or your favourite band.
* Aquatic ‚Äì An aquatic theme can be fun, especially if being held at a pool or beach. Themes including boys, sailors, mermaids and anything under the sea would look great.
* Outer space- This theme is out of this world and can include the moon, stars, rockets, astronauts and aliens.
* Occupation ‚Äì Have your guests dress up in what they think the baby will do later in life. Some ideas are doctors, nurses, construction workers, pilots and firefighters.



# Food and catering

Food and catering is a major cost. So the first thing to decide is who will do the catering. Will you have an external caterer or will you be doing this yourself? The season and the time of the party will have a big impact on what food you serve. You also have to consider your guests‚Äô dietary requirements. And any allergies they may have. Here are some simple yet delicious catering ideas;

# Food

Having quality food at a baby shower is essential. So if possible try to offer a selection of food everyone will love. Some ideas are;

* Grazing plates ‚Äì Always a favourite and perfect for year-round functions. They are easy to make and consume and don‚Äôt make much mess.
* Sliders ‚Äì These tasty little burgers always go down a treat. Ideal for a lunch or dinner snack but can get a little messy and leave guests hungry.
* Cake ‚Äì It‚Äôs nice to have something sweet and a cake is a good alternative to cupcakes.
* Cupcakes ‚Äì Always a favourite, cupcakes are a cute way of celebrating the baby shower. You can also have them custom-made. We had some cupcakes made by¬†[Andrea Cake Atelier](https://andreacakeatelier.com/)¬†to celebrate the opening of our shop complete with little bibs.

Make sure you have catered enough and any leftovers can be taken by yourself or the guests.

# Refreshments

You will want to offer a mixture of drinks for your guests. It‚Äôs best to choose a selection of alcohol and non-alcoholic drinks.

* Tea and coffee ‚Äì Perfect for having with your cake! Offer a large selection of coffee and teas as people‚Äôs tastes vary considerably.
* Alcoholic ‚Äì Whether you want to offer beer, champagne, wine, or (my favourite) apple spritzer. It‚Äôs nice to have some alcohol for those who want to have a drink.
* Non-alcoholic ‚Äì You will want to offer some non-alcoholic drinks too. Things like water, soft drinks, mocktails, kombucha, orange and apple juice are always welcome.



# Baby shower decoration

Decorating a baby shower can be a rewarding and fun experience. It‚Äôs all about preparing the venue for your guests to have a good time. Below we have offered some ideas and where possible use environmentally friendly or reusable option.

* Bunting- Our nursery bunting can also be used for the baby shower as decorations.
* Balloons ‚Äì I‚Äôm not a fan of using balloons due to¬†[their impact on the environment](https://www.sustainability.vic.gov.au/recycling-and-reducing-waste/at-home/avoid-waste/minimise-single-use-items/balloons), especially helium balloons. But as this is your baby shower it‚Äôs up to you how you decorate.
* Flowers ‚Äì The more the merrier I say! Flowers can turn a dull space into a beautiful area.
* Candles ‚Äì Depending on the time of day and the venue you choose,¬†[candles can be a nice addition](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product/candle-crystal-treasure-tin/). Be careful not to set off any fire alarms or sprinklers.
* Flower centrepiece ‚Äì A beautiful flower centrepiece will bring the room to life. This is also something you will be able to take home and enjoy long after the baby shower.
* Sign or Banner ‚Äì A sign or banner welcoming guests to the baby shower can be a nice gesture. It‚Äôs also a good way for you to let your guests know they are at the right venue.
* Keepsake or Card for guests to write in ‚Äì Having something for your guests to pass on their best wishes is a nice thought. One idea is this¬†[baby journal](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product/baby-journal/)¬†where guests write on the cover while you fill out the rest after the baby is born.
* Name tags ‚Äì Although they aren‚Äôt decorations, it‚Äôs a good idea to have name tags printed out. This makes it easier for guests to get to know each other.
* Flower wall ‚Äì Another idea is to have a flower wall. This is a great photogenic prop that you and your guests will love!

Although decorations won‚Äôt make or break the party, they will provide a nice ambience. Try and make the decorations as warm as possible so people are more relaxed and ready to have a good time.



# Furniture and utensils

If you are having the festivities at your home you may need to hire, buy or use your own furniture and utensils.  
Here we have listed some things you may need but your requirements will vary based on the venue, budget and style.

* Table and Tablecloth ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt have enough table space you could always borrow one. Or you can buy a foldable table from Bunnings. A few white cotton tablecloths are a nice addition.
* Chairs ‚Äì You will want to have enough chairs to cater for those who would like to sit. I‚Äôd work on having a seat for everyone so they can sit and eat. You may wish to not have any chairs as this will force people to mingle.
* Eating Utensils ‚Äì These days you can buy some very cool and stylish eating utensils. Stay away from plastic products and go for a recyclable bamboo option.
* Napkins ‚Äì Any major supermarket will have a selection of Napkins. If you do want to have something a bit extra you could get some printed with your baby shower details.
* Spiral cake display ‚Äì If you plan to have cupcakes, you should have a spiral cake display. They are cheap but add a little more style to your decorations.
* Glasses ‚Äì Make sure you have different types of glassware for the refreshments you serve. Get more than there are guests as they may have different types of drinks throughout the party.
* Water Jugs ‚Äì Have water jugs and lots of water in hand.
* Hot water urn ‚Äì A hot water urn is essential for those who want tea or coffee.
* Cups and sources ‚Äì You may want to splurge on a nice set of cups and sources. This way, after the party, you can have a nice set for yourself.
* Teapots ‚Äì A stylish teapot will add that extra bit of elegance to the party. Hide the urn out the back and serve people in a beautiful teapot instead.
* Cart ‚Äì If you don‚Äôt want to use tables you could hire a cart to serve all the food and refreshments. They look very cool and will bring that extra style to your baby shower.

Whatever furniture and utensils you choose, try to think long term. If possible buy items that you will reuse yourself in the future. If you don‚Äôt think you will use them again look into hiring them.



# Gifts and Present Opening

Gift-giving is a major part of any baby shower. The idea is to give presents that will be used in the first few years of their baby‚Äôs life. Raising a child can be expensive, so any gifts are always appreciated.

* How much to spend ‚Äì It can be difficult to know¬†[how much a guest should spend](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/how-much-to-spend-on-a-baby-shower-gift/)¬†on a baby shower gift. It will depend on your budget and relationship with the mum-to-be but can be anywhere between $40 and $140. The parents-to-be are more concerned with your attendance rather than the gift you give.
* Types of gifts ‚Äì When deciding what to give, choose something that will be used in the first 12 months and are practical. When we developed our¬†[baby hampers](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/product-category/baby-gifts/)¬†these are what we had in mind. For inspiration on gifts read our¬†[baby essentials list](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/baby-essentials/)¬†article or visit¬†[our baby gift shop](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/baby-gifts-perth/)¬†in Perth.
* When to open the gifts ‚Äì During the baby shower, you will be given many gifts. You may not know¬†[when you should open your baby shower gifts](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/opening-baby-shower-gifts/). Traditionally people like the gift opening at the party but it is up to you.

[](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Bub-and-Mum-Hamper-Wild-Lavender-Main-Image.jpg)

Gifts are a big part of the baby shower but it shouldn‚Äôt be the main focus. The parents-to-be would be more grateful for your attendance rather than the gifts.



# Baby shower games

Baby shower games are a great icebreaker and a chance for people to mingle and get to know each other. Below we have listed some baby shower games you may want to include.

* Baby name race
* Baby unscramble
* The price is right
* Don‚Äôt say baby
* Prizes ‚Äì baby shower favours
* Quiz
* Relay race
* Song game
* Unscramble

We haven‚Äôt gone into great detail here as this has been covered in our¬†[article on baby shower games](https://www.mylittleloveheart.com.au/baby-shower-games/).



# What to wear and dress code

Traditionally guests get dressed up for a baby shower. However, as the host it‚Äôs up to you to decide the dress code. If you are having a themed party you can ask your guests to dress up in that theme. And for yourself, you may want to include a sash or hat that says ‚ÄúMum to Be‚Äù.



# Baby shower alternatives

Some people are moving away from traditional baby showers and below is a list of alternative celebrations you may choose.

Schon vom ersten Tag an war ich fasziniert von der Stadt: die eleganten alten Colleges, die charmanten Caf√©s, die kleinen Buchl√§den in den Kopfsteinpflastergassen ‚Äì Oxford hat einfach eine ganz eigene Atmosph√§re. Meine Lieblingsaktivit√§t hier? Ganz klar:¬†einfach durch die Stadt schlendern, die Stimmung aufsaugen und beobachten, wie Geschichte und modernes Leben ineinander √ºbergehen.
In meinem¬†Cambridge-Kurs auf dem EF Campus¬†lerne ich jeden Tag Neues. Der Unterricht ist nicht nur spannend und interaktiv, sondern auch unglaublich lustig ‚Äì und ich merke, wie mein Englisch sich ganz nat√ºrlich verbessert. Doch das Beste daran ist:¬†Das Lernen h√∂rt nach dem Unterricht nicht auf.¬†Beim Einkaufen, im Gespr√§ch mit meiner liebevollen Gastfamilie oder abends beim Essen mit Freunden ‚Äì pl√∂tzlich spricht man einfach Englisch, ohne dar√ºber nachzudenken.
Und genau diese Freunde machen die Erfahrung noch sch√∂ner. Ich habe hier¬†wunderbare Menschen aus aller Welt¬†kennengelernt ‚Äì Leute, die ganz unterschiedliche Geschichten mitbringen, aber dieselbe Neugier und Offenheit teilen. Besonders eng bin ich mit einer Freundin aus¬†Schweden¬†geworden. Wir haben uns gleich verstanden und schon Pl√§ne geschmiedet, uns gegenseitig zu besuchen, wenn die Sprachreise vorbei ist.
Jetzt, wo die Wochen in Oxford langsam vergehen, merke ich, wie sehr mich diese Zeit ver√§ndert hat ‚Äì sprachlich, aber auch pers√∂nlich. Es f√ºhlt sich nicht nur wie ein Sprachkurs an, sondern wie ein kleiner Abschnitt meines Lebens, den ich nie vergessen werde und von dem ich mir w√ºnsche er w√ºrde ewig gehen.
Oxford und EF hat mir gezeigt, dass Englischlernen am besten funktioniert, wenn man es einfach lebt ‚Äì mitten in einer Stadt voller Geschichte, Kultur und neuer Freundschaften.

1o4ls35,https://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1o4ls35/baby_formula_distribution_program/,Baby formula distribution program,"Hello Portland! I‚Äôm brainstorming putting together some type of neighborhood baby formula (food) distribution mutual aid in the area. With SNAP and WIC benefits weakening I‚Äôd like to support the mothers, parents, caregivers, and young babies here in Portland. 

Idea: pooled funds, neighborhood specific distribution points
Each neighborhood needs at least one point of contact and a few distribution volunteers to deliver formula/food when needed. Signs and donations baskets are placed in neighborhood coffee shops/stores. Signs would explain the mutual aid, have donations and inquire QR codes, and let caregivers know they can take from the basket or inquire with neighborhood POC, no questions asked. 

My questions: would enough people be interested in volunteering their time to their neighborhoods? Would one time donations be enough to establish and maintain the work or would recurring contributions be more effective? What monetary donation websites/companies are ethical, have recurring contributions options, and allow longstanding fund raising? Would allowing people to donate physical containers of baby formula/food cause concern for theft? (Should I really be concerned about people who don‚Äôt need the items taking the items?) Would coffee shops/stores be willing to collect cash and/or formula/food donations? Is there a program already like this?

I had never had any kind of surgery before and didn't really know what to expect so maybe this will help someone else!

I had a total abdominal hysterectomy, ovaries left, on 8 Oct. I'm in the UK, and had my surgery done with the NHS.  Had fibroids, with a uterus weighing around 1,000g (have not yet got pathology results for more accurate measurements) and surprise undiagnosed endometriosis on uterus and bowel. 4dpo and starting to feel better if still fragile and tired.

Brief timeline

Total waiting time from being put on a gynecology waiting list to surgery: 69 weeks 

Sep 2023 Found to be anaemic, followed by various examinations due to existing bowel issues which led to nothing (assuming this all now to be related to the endo!). Started measuring bleeding to advocate for myself. My main symptom was very heavy bleeding 

Jun 2024 Ultrasound confirmed fibroids. Referred to gynecology by GP

Oct 2025 still waiting for NHS appointment, Private consultant to confirm diagnosis and advise on next steps but decided to wait for NHS treatment

Dec 2024 MRI confirmed fibroids

Feb 2025 initial consultant appointment NHS to confirm hysterectomy waiting list

Apr 2025 consultant appointment

Jun 2025 Hysteroscopy with biopsy  

Jul 2025 Pre-op appointment 

8 Oct 2025 surgery. Pre-op appointment and tests had to be repeated the week before as they were now out of date due to several delays to the operation date

Surgery day

Was told to come in at 7.30am. Got checked in and told to wait in the waiting area. Got called in to meet various bits of the surgery team separately - a couple of the junior doctors, the anaesthetist, then the consultant and the rest of the team - and they asked some questions, I had a chance to ask questions and I had to sign a consent form. I had my husband with me for all of this. Then the nurses took me to get changed into the hospital gown, stockings and grippy socks, and to give a urine sample. I left my bag in a locker and at the door to the operating theatre area my husband was told he couldn't come any further now.

The nurse took me to the theatre, where the anaesthetist and a couple of nurses were waiting for me. I was asked to sit on the side of the bed and open the back of my gown for the spinal anaesthesia. 
A nurse inserted two cannulas onto my right hand and injected something that immediately made me dizzy. The spinal anaesthetic was also injected, and I only remember chatting a little with the nurse who was asking questions, then nothing at all.

I woke up in a recovery room maybe three hours later, to a nurse calling my name. I felt groggy and disorientated but there wasn't much pain. When I had woken up a little I was given a milky coffee which tasted like the best thing ever. I also got a few biscuits which I very slowly nibbled on over the next several hours. The nurse called my husband to let him know I was out of surgery and doing fine, but he couldn't visit until I was transferred to a ward. That took almost six hours, because, it seemed, there just weren't any beds available. I was also brought my bag so I had my phone to entertain me and to keep in contact with people. The recovery room slowly filled up, with other people wheeled in from the theatres in beds and (less slowly, it seems), wheeled out to the wards. The nurses were lovely and kept asking if there was anything I wanted but apart from the coffee and water and the biscuits I didn't really have much appetite. I might have been given some more painkillers but I'm not sure, but I think I was pretty high on the opiates and didn't feel much pain at all. 

I was finally wheeled on to the ward at six in the evening. Being wheeled around in the bed was by far the most fun aspect about this whole thing!

I was put in a room of four beds and given some food. My husband was able to visit that evening. I ended up staying for two nights which was more than I had thought, but then I had been told at least one night. I had a catheter which meant limited movement but which allowed me to drink a lot of water without worrying about having to get up.

Otherwise I just kept snoozing off. I had my phone but couldn't really concentrate for long periods on reading or browsing. I was given opiates for the time I was at the hospital, as well as blood thinners and IV antibiotics, and paracetamol and ibuprofen. My bloods were taken a couple of times, and my blood pressure and temperature several times a day (and night). I had a little bit of temperature the first night and felt hot and sweaty but that settled quickly, and I was in pain that first night and the following day but not very much after.

The hospital was very noisy, there was something happening constantly and consequently it was impossible to get any actual rest. The room was in a busy location, with the kitchen and staff offices nearby which didn't help - a roommate who had been in previously said the other side of the ward is much quieter! The food was what you would expect, not great but the staff were mostly lovely as were my fellow patients.

The doctors did their ward rounds in the mornings, a much expected event as that was when you'd be told if you'd get discharged and get to go home. I was told I had to eat and drink without issues, move a little and pee (once the catheter was taken out) before I could go home. I was discharged 2dpo around lunchtime with laxatives and pain medication and told to make a follow-up appointment at around 8wpo.

Most useful things so far (and things I wish I had thought of):
* Eye patches for the hospital. Useful day and night. Would have been absolutely impossible to get even the little sleep I did without them
* Earplugs for the hospital. I usually hate using them but wish I had had some. Not sure why I didn't ask for my husband to bring them either, but it really was very noisy, day and night. I did have ear buds which I used to block out some of the noise at night
* Mints on hand in the hospital, helpful for mild nausea
* Cough drops. The couple of times I've got something caught in my throat these have really helped to prevent a coughing fit. Even the tiniest cough really hurts!
* Pillow to clutch for the journey home

Homie said he wanted a pair of Burning Eyes but didin‚Äôt have the pures so I told him I could borrow him 50 wls (I don‚Äôt have too many wls either) and he could give them back once he sold some farmables or something. I logged off as I had some chores to do for the rest of the evening and logged back in today. 

He fucking removed me from the friend list, blocked me on my phone, Whatsapp, social media etc. FOR 50 WORLD LOCKS. FOR LITERALLY ABOUT A CENT. HOW IS THIS EVEN REAL. THIS IS WHAT GROWTOPIA DOES DO TO A MF.

I know this is supposed to look like a meme but this shit actually happened to me just now.

1o4lmd8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrCreepensVault/comments/1o4lmd8/dog_eat_dog_chapter_1/,Dog Eat Dog [Chapter 1],"Two years after my first hunt, the night before the Harvest Moon, I was at the local tavern playing a game of liar‚Äôs dice against some other hunters, including Arthur. By the time midnight came around, it was just the two of us playing. He looked at me through a squinted eye. The other was covered by a black patch.



‚ÄúFour sixes,‚Äù he said.



‚ÄúBullshit,‚Äù I remarked.



Begrudgingly, he lifted his cup, revealing a three, two fives, and two sixes. In the end, the pot was mine. I collected my winnings and redistributed them to the other players, buying another round of bitter beer that was brewed locally. For Arthur, I bought him a cup of peppermint tea.



It was around this time when we heard footsteps marching outside. People cheered as a group of hunters burst into the tavern, carrying a beast on their shoulders, riddled with arrows and bullets. Arthur leapt from his seat so fast that he almost knocked over his tea.



‚ÄúIs it Baskerville?‚Äù he asked no one in particular.



‚ÄúCalm down,‚Äù one of the hunters said. ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt your precious Baskerville. We went and caught us the Banshee Beast. Bastard screamed until his last breath.‚Äù



Arthur relaxed and returned to his seat. Every hunter knew Baskerville was reserved for Arthur. An easy request considering a majority of hunters didn‚Äôt believe Baskerville was real. I knew Arthur to be an honest man, always. But even I had my doubts about Baskerville‚Äôs existence. In the last two years, I‚Äôd yet to see a beast that could move with the shadows.



The tavern owner doled out a round for the returning hunters, claiming he‚Äôd have their beast beheaded and taxidermied. He‚Äôd hang it up with the other beast heads mounted on the walls. There were almost too many of them to count, but I only ever noticed the one at the back of the room. Silvery fur, jagged teeth, marble red eyes. Arthur‚Äôs kill but my beast.



While I sat and bullshitted with Arthur, the hunters eventually scattered, finding seats across the bar. They were a rambunctious lot. Constantly chattering and laughing. Trading stories, taunts, or jabs, depending on what mood they were in. Successful hunts brought out the best in us.



Smoke wafted through the air from their pipes and hand-rolled cigarettes. The smell of yeast was potent. As well as the sweeter scents of red wine. Although previous experience had told me the wine was almost as bitter as the beer.



A group of people played live music on stage. Equipped with acoustic guitars and flutes and banjos and whatever else they‚Äôd manage to get their hands on. They were singing an old world song called ‚ÄúRandy Dandy Oh‚Äù. A naval shanty originally from the 1800s.



I was just about to start a game of poker with Arthur and the boys when the tavern doors flew open. Sofia Lopez, a local medic, came rushing in. She stopped at the entryway, scanned the crowd, and when she found me, she shouldered her way through the crowd.



‚ÄúTrouble in paradise?‚Äù Arthur said slyly.



I kicked him under the table and tossed my cards back into the pile. Sofia was one of the few in town who avoided the tavern. Work at the physician‚Äôs office kept her too busy to celebrate like the rest of us.



‚ÄúLast night‚Äôs hunters returned,‚Äù she said, panting.



‚ÄúI‚Äôve noticed,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúWhat of it?‚Äù



‚ÄúNicolas‚Äôs platoon never came back.‚Äù



The Deadeye Hunter was overdue. Which either meant his crew got tied up during their hunt, or‚Ä¶



‚ÄúThey‚Äôre prob‚Äôly just runnin‚Äô behind,‚Äù I said.



Sofia shook her head. ‚ÄúNicolas is never late.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat do you want me to do about it?‚Äù I glanced over at Arthur for support. He offered a haphazard shrug. ‚ÄúMaybe they got lost.‚Äù



She scoffed. ‚ÄúNicolas has been a hunter longer than any of you. Do you really think he got lost?‚Äù



Sofia was in her early twenties. Lithe frame, silky black hair, darker skin. Bleeding heart, like my mother. But there was a hardness to her. One built from countless surgeries. Stitching hunters back together after long days battling beasts. I‚Äôd wager she‚Äôd seen more blood than the rest of us. More death too.



Two years ago, when she‚Äôd first arrived at our village, she was doe-eyed and quiet. People thought she was mute. Time and experience change you, though. I could attest to that.



I took a drink of beer and bit back the urge to grimace. ‚ÄúLook, you really want me to say it? If Nicolas or any of his crew haven‚Äôt come back yet, it means they‚Äôre prob‚Äôly dead. If Nicolas is dead, then I assume he must‚Äôve meant a monster of a beast out there. I pray to Solis that he was able to kill the beast before it finished him off.‚Äù



She cuffed me on the shoulder. ‚ÄúHow can you act like you don‚Äôt give a shit? Nicolas was your friend. All of you. You‚Äôre just gonna consign him to death?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not consigning him to shit,‚Äù I said, a growl in my throat. ‚ÄúEvery hunter knows the risks. If they wanna take up arms against the beast, they‚Äôre doing so by their own consent. It was his choice to walk out of the village, and whether he comes back or not is up to him. There‚Äôs nothin‚Äô I can do about it.‚Äù



Sofia leaned close. Her voice was low but firm. ‚ÄúNicolas was there for you when Thomas died. He grieved your brother almost as much as you. He helped care for your mother, he looked after Jason whenever you were away on a hunt‚Äî‚Äù



I shoved away from the table and walked off. Sofia wasn‚Äôt going to give up that easily, though. She chased after me, a shadow at my heels.



‚ÄúI don't know why you care so much,‚Äù I said over my shoulder. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like Nicolas was your friend.‚Äù



‚ÄúNick was a good man. He was a friend to everyone in the village. He looked after people‚Äîcared about them. And I want to know what happened to him out there,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWhat I don‚Äôt understand is how you can be so quick to give up on him.‚Äù



I stepped outside, and Sofia followed me. Some hunters and locals greeted me with waves and smiles. A few clapped me on the back as I started down the hillside toward the residential part of town.



‚ÄúI‚Äôm not giving up on him,‚Äù I reassured her. ‚ÄúBut you know the rules. We hunt. We kill the beasts. We don‚Äôt send out rescue teams. We don‚Äôt look for the dead.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat if he‚Äôs not dead?‚Äù



‚ÄúThen he will be by morning. No one, not even Emilia the Ripper, could make it an entire night by herself.‚Äù



‚ÄúNicolas wasn‚Äôt alone.‚Äù



‚ÄúTrust me, I know who he took with him on the hunt. Greybeards and new bloods. Hunters green as grass. Nicolas or not, they ain‚Äôt survivin‚Äô the night either.‚Äù



Sofia shoved me. I stumbled forward a few paces and caught myself on the side of a building. Nearby, a mother and her child looked over at us. They quickly returned to their chores, knowing better than to get caught up in someone else‚Äôs drama.



‚ÄúI see what people really mean to you,‚Äù Sofia remarked. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so easy for you to just cut ‚Äòem loose.‚Äù



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easier to mourn a friend than hold out hope against the impossible. I liked Nicolas‚Äîhe was practically a father to me after Thomas‚Ä¶‚Äù I sighed. ‚ÄúBut going after him is a death wish. Especially if I go alone.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen don‚Äôt go alone.‚Äù



I laughed. While Sofia had learned her way around the village, had become inured to some of our more harsh customs, she was still naive about the protocols hunters followed. Protocols first instituted by H.P. Corbet, our founding father. Those same protocols were still practiced under Sir Rafe‚Äôs administration. Whether we liked it or not.



Rules kept us civil. Kept us sane. Kept us alive.



‚ÄúI‚Äôd have an easier time convincing hunters to butcher their own families than go out on a death wish,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúEveryone liked Nicolas‚Äîthey loved him. But I‚Äôm willin‚Äô to wager not even a fourth of ‚Äòem would go out lookin‚Äô for him. Especially if they‚Äôre not being compensated for it, and we both know Sir Rafe wouldn‚Äôt authorize a search and rescue.‚Äù



‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt it concern you that there‚Äôs a beast out there that could kill Nicolas?‚Äù



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a beast out there that could kill any of us. Never forget that.‚Äù



By then, Arthur had caught up to us. He soothed Sofia with half-hearted reassurances that Nicolas would return. ‚ÄúJust wait, you‚Äôll see,‚Äù he said. He wrapped an arm around her shoulders and guided her back to the tavern. ‚ÄúCome now, I‚Äôll buy you a drink. We can discuss it further.‚Äù



When they were out of sight, I turned for home. But I stopped short, staring at the dark little house at the end of the lane. The house that had once been full of laughter and songs.



Since the days of my father and Thomas, it‚Äôd become a hollow ruin just waiting to collapse. And it took everything I could do to keep it upright. That was my job. Not hunting beasts, not protecting the villagers, but keeping my family fed and safe.



But then, I had to wonder what Thomas would‚Äôve done in my shoes. What my father might‚Äôve done.



Instead of heading home, as I should have, I went to the north side where Sir Rafe‚Äôs estate resided. He lived in an old cathedral comprised of stone brick with tapered spires and arched windows of stained glass. The front doors were thick wood plated with strips of steel and bolts. A lantern hung from above, creaking in the wind, sending a flurry of shadows swirling at my feet.



I rapped my knuckles against the door and waited. A few moments later, I could hear footsteps from within. The front door opened. Emilia the Ripper greeted me. Blond hair, pale skin, face concealed beneath a hood. She was one of the few hunters who preferred the night.



‚ÄúI need to speak with Sir Rafe,‚Äù I said.



‚ÄúIt‚Äôs late.‚Äù Her voice was low and gentle. A complete juxtaposition of her appearance. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs resting.‚Äù



‚ÄúThen wake him. It‚Äôs urgent.‚Äù



Emilia studied me for a moment. We‚Äôd seen each other out on the field a handful of times, but other than those momentary encounters, we hardly ever interacted. I wouldn‚Äôt have been surprised if she slammed the door in my face, but instead, she stepped aside and gestured for me to enter.



The inside of Sir Rafe‚Äôs home was a stretch of velvet carpet over concrete floors. In the main hall, there were dozens of old pews where hunters would sit during our council meetings. Down another hallway was Sir Rafe‚Äôs personal chambers.



Half the room was a study. Furnished with a large wooden desk. The wall behind it was lined by shelves overflowing with dusty books. The other half, near the right side of the room, was outfitted with a pair of leather chairs sat before a fireplace.



When I entered, Sir Rafe sat in one of these chairs, bundled beneath several quilts and blankets. The hearth crackled and spat embers into the dark. The air stunk of vanilla intermingled with smoke. Both from the fireplace and from Sir Rafe‚Äôs pipe.



As I approached, Sir Rafe hummed a merry tune under his breath. A tune I didn‚Äôt recognize. He turned his head toward me. A smile pulled at his cracked lips, emphasizing the wrinkles of his face.



Long, wispy white hair cascaded around his shoulders. Grey hairs stippled his face. He was dressed in a dark button-up and smoking jacket with a scarf wrapped around his neck. His hands were covered by a pair of black fingerless gloves.



‚ÄúAh, if it isn‚Äôt Bernie the Bold,‚Äù he said. His words had an underlying croak to them. Old age combined with years of smoking had given him the voice of a toad.



Bernie the Bold was a nickname anointed by Sir Rafe himself. However, most of the others‚Äîvillagers and hunters alike‚Äîpreferred Bernadette the Barren. I didn‚Äôt care for either title, if I‚Äôm honest.



‚ÄúI apologize, sir,‚Äù I said, bowing as was per custom. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mean to disturb your rest.‚Äù



He waved my concerns away and squawked with laughter. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not often that I get a visitor so late. Come now, my child, take a seat. Let us converse in comfort. We can speak long into the night. Swapping stories and thoughts like classroom gossip.‚Äù



Suffice to say, Sir Rafe was a ‚Äòpeculiar‚Äô man. Popular with the people for his whimsical nature. Babies and children didn‚Äôt care much for him, though. They found his withered visage slightly disquieting. They weren‚Äôt the only ones.



He sent Emilia away to fetch a kettle of hot water for coffee and tea. Before she could slip out, he asked her to grab a tray of cookies the school children had baked for him earlier that evening.¬†



My younger brother, Jason, had brought some of those cookies home with him. Hard as a brick, and while they were meant to resemble hunters, they looked more like charred men. I decided to make my visit brief to avoid having to endure any more of them.



‚ÄúSir, the reason I‚Äôm here is about Nicolas,‚Äù I began. ‚ÄúHe went on a hunt earlier, and he hasn‚Äôt returned.‚Äù



Sir Rafe nodded ruefully and rubbed a hand over his stubbled cheeks. ‚ÄúYes, I‚Äôve heard. Tragic, tragic affair. I commend your concern, but alas, Nicolas and the others are lost to us now. We will hold a funeral for them and may Solis guide their souls to the Eternal Dream.‚Äù



‚ÄúSir, maybe we shouldn‚Äôt be so hasty about the matter. Nicolas is one of the best hunters we‚Äôve got. If anyone could survive out there, it‚Äôs him.‚Äù



I knew the chances of survival were slim, but despite rationality, I had to feign optimism. If not for myself, then at the very least, for Sofia‚Äôs sake.



‚ÄúPerhaps we could send out a search group,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúIf not to rescue them, then to confirm their deaths.‚Äù



He cocked an eyebrow. ‚ÄúNow, that is most curious. We‚Äôve never sent out a search party before. Not even when H.P. Corbert didn‚Äôt return from his last hunt.‚Äù



‚ÄúI know, sir, but‚Äî‚Äù



He laid a hand on mine, squeezing gently. ‚ÄúI understand. This is a hard thing to accept, but we must endure. That is the way of humanity.‚Äù He patted my hand before returning his to his lap. ‚ÄúGrieve for our fallen brothers and sisters, but don‚Äôt give your life for them. You have family and friends.‚Äù



‚ÄúNicolas has friends too,‚Äù I countered.



A pitiful smile appeared on his face. ‚ÄúYes, I am aware. I was one of those friends. But right now, we don‚Äôt need to lose any more brothers or sisters. Not for Nicolas, not for me, not for anyone.‚Äù



It was then Emilia the Ripper returned with a tray of burned cookies and a kettle of hot water. She placed them on an endstand and poured two cups of coffee, adding a splash of pasteurized milk. She handed one cup to me and the other to Sir Rafe.



Despite the milk, the coffee was bitter. I choked it down, hoping to curry some favor from Sir Rafe. When he gestured to the cookies, insisting I have one, I forced one of those down as well, much to his delight.



‚ÄúPlease, Bernie,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúdo not wrack yourself with guilt over the demise of Nicolas. It can be hard, I know, but‚Äî‚Äù



He stopped speaking as Emilia leaned down and whispered in his ear. His lips pursed as she spoke, and his brow tightened. When Emilia was finished, he thanked her and rubbed a hand up and down her forearm.



‚ÄúBernie,‚Äù Sir Rafe said, ‚Äúare you serious about wanting to look for Nicolas?‚Äù



‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have come if I weren‚Äôt.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhile I can‚Äôt permit a search and rescue operation, I can offer you a chance to join Lady Emilia on tomorrow‚Äôs hunt. She‚Äôll be treading the same ground as Nicolas.‚Äù



I frowned. ‚ÄúAnd what exactly was Nicolas hunting for?‚Äù



‚ÄúA few dens in a city known as Cairnsmouth. About thirty miles from here.‚Äù



Thirty miles was a long way to go for a hunt. We usually patrolled the surrounding area unless we thought there were resources worth scavenging for beyond our set perimeter.



‚ÄúSomethin‚Äô special about these dens?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúMust be if you‚Äôre going so far for ‚Äòem.‚Äù



Sir Rafe turned to Emilia. She said, ‚ÄúNicolas was sent after G√©vaudan.‚Äù



My cookie and coffee almost came back up. G√©vaudan was reportedly the largest and most vicious beast we‚Äôd ever seen. Although no one had encountered him in over a year.



That was part of the reason Bram the Conductor had retired from hunting. He became a school teacher and preacher instead. I had to hear about some of his lectures from Jason, and furtively, I was glad to be out of school.



I accepted the offer and finished my coffee. When I was done, Sir Rafe prepared for bed. Emilia the Ripper escorted me outside.



‚ÄúWe leave tomorrow at noon,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúBe at the armory by eleven o‚Äôclock.‚Äù



‚ÄúHow many hunters are we taking?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúEnough.‚Äù



I sneered. ‚ÄúWas that how many Nicolas had taken too?‚Äù



Her gaze was cold, biting. Her voice even more so. ‚ÄúNicolas and his team were sent out on reconnaissance. They weren‚Äôt supposed to engage the enemy.‚Äù



I‚Äôd never known Nicolas to disobey an order. Which meant the enemy had engaged him first. If he really was looking for G√©vaudan, then the possibility of him being alive was next to naught.



‚ÄúStarting tomorrow,‚Äù Emilia said, ‚Äúkeep your comments to yourself.‚Äù



‚ÄúStarting tomorrow, right?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúWell, if that‚Äôs the case, you can‚Äôt make a cup of coffee for shit. Y‚Äôknow that?‚Äù



She snorted. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Emilia the Ripper, you twat. Not Emilia the Housemaid.‚Äù She started to close the door. ‚ÄúTomorrow, eleven o‚Äôclock sharp, or we‚Äôre leaving you behind.‚Äù

1o4ljn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o4ljn8/extraction_time_help_delonghi_dedica_ec685/,Extraction Time Help [Delonghi Dedica EC685],"Hey guys!

Been a lurker for some time slowly gathering information and now I‚Äôve started on my bottomless portafilter journey with the Dedica I‚Äôm in need of some help I think!

I‚Äôve got a ProCook Burr Coffee Grinder but they don‚Äôt sell it no more so who knows if that‚Äôs a good thing haha.

I‚Äôve been grinding on the second lowest setting and it appears that I‚Äôm getting a nice uniform extraction from below the portafilter and the coffee tastes noticeably better!

My issue and confusion is the extraction time part. I know it should be between 20-30s but with the dedica I‚Äôm getting around 40 seconds each time on the double espresso shot button.

Is this literally just as simple as that‚Äôs what the button is set to? I know you can manually adjust the extraction time by holding it but that goes against a lot that I‚Äôve read where the grind size and distribution etc. affects the extraction time.

So I guess I‚Äôm just wondering if me manually timing 25s on the double and going from there is a good way to go? Or I‚Äôm completely missing something and I need educating.

Thank you very much in advance :)

I can film a shot if that‚Äôs required!",1,1760264590.0,espresso,4,1.0,False

I am a left wing curvy feminist who enjoys witty, sarcastic conversation. I speak Catalan, Spanish and English. I like sketching, walking around with a coffee in hand looking at the architecture, reading, going to museums and the theatre, going to Sant Antoni market on Sundays then having a vermut. Alternatively, going to Zona Franca market and having vermut.

I also have a Switch, I play creepy games (Inside, Mortuary Assistant, The Longing), Mario Kart and Animal Crossing.
