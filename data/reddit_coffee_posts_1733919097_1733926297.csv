I don't know if anyone here relates because this may be more due to my childhood emotional neglect, but I have never felt like I have belonged anywhere. This feeling goes back as far as I can remember. My earliest memory of it is playing tee-ball at age 5 or 6, and it continues to this day. It doesn't matter how regularly or consistently I attend a group, I still feel like an outsider. This is true even at work where I've been on the same team for 2 1/2 years. On rare occasions I am able to relax and enjoy myself, and alcohol helps (not at work obviously! lol), but I've come to the point where I figure this feeling will most likely never go away so I don't even feel like trying to get out in groups any more. The problem with this is it is socially isolating which only feeds my depression. It's been suggested that instead of groups that I try 1-on-1 things like grabbing a cup of coffee. Even that is hard for me to initiate lately, but I need to do something about this. I can't go on this way.",1,1733926106.0,dysthymia,0,1.0,False

I need some advice. For Context, I hired a friend to my team because he was struggling to find a job. Last month, when a colleague was leaving, I didn’t plan to buy a gift since we weren’t that close, and I was tight on cash. He insisted on buying something and said I could pay him back later, and I reluctantly agreed thinking id pay him on Dec Salary.

Today, he (a major people-pleaser) bought Harry Potter-themed diaries for everyone in the office. I politely declined because I already have a meaningful one my dad gave me. Later, when I returned from a coffee break, I walked into him announcing to my other work colleague (Ops manager) and the whole team that I owe him money, and I probably wouldn’t even like the diary. It was super awkward and embarrassing.

I just mumbled something about not liking diaries and sat down. It feels like a really low blow, and I’m not sure how to handle this situation. Any advice?

1hbu8rn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buddhism/comments/1hbu8rn/what_is_buddhist_attitude_to_this_video/,What is Buddhist attitude to this video? ,"I watched a video by James Hoffman, the famous barista, coffee expert, and online coffee evangelist. It made me want to examine it from the point of view of Buddhism (or, rather, different schools of Buddhism).

It seems at first that the entire video would be antithetical to Theravada, and maybe even Mahayana except maybe Zen, and would be maybe along the lines of Vajrayana. But maybe I am wrong, and my understanding of the schools is overly simplistic. 

I'm not asking this to rank the approaches somehow or invite argument. The video produced mixed emotions in me. I come from religious background that was very anti–sensual pleasure, and I thought this approach lacked nuance, because even though pleasure can corrupt a person, it can also elevate one. I became interested in Kashmir Shaivism because it's world-affirmatory and not renunciatory, and because I perceived Buddhism as the latter, I was turned off by it. But now I think maybe my view of Buddhism was unnuanced.

1hbu597,https://www.reddit.com/r/atypicalpests/comments/1hbu597/never_lie_to_a_dragonfly/,Never Lie To A Dragonfly ,"This was a pickle. 

Illuminated by the meager beam of light provided by his dying phone, Jarod's driver's side tire sank into the road, the rubber flabby and pathetic against the pavement. The winter wind flayed his exposed face and hands as he wrapped his arms around himself, making the skin feel like stretched leather over his bones. He shook his head in dismay. 

He'd been riding on that donut for the past few miles after his normal one blew out, trying to find a motel somewhere in whatever nameless, podunk town he'd ended up in. Go figure he hit a pothole he couldn't see thanks to this piece of shit road not having any streetlights. 

This *was* a pickle. 

Jarod had passed a gas station not too long ago. But would it be open? Better than waiting at the side of a dark road with no service and only ten percent left on his phone's battery. 

With a sigh and an aggrieved shake of his head, Jarod began to walk. Being a city boy, he wasn't aware that the rustling in the woods nearby was nothing to be nervous about. Neither were the glowing eyes. They were just deer, being a bit more brave than usual due to rutting season. But since he was none the wiser, he found himself looking over his shoulder as if he were being followed by some sinister, unseen predator.

By the time Jarod saw the red, white, and blue lights of the gas station, his teeth were chattering.  Once inside, he discovered that his hands had turned the same color as raw beef. 

The twenty-something woman behind the counter greeted him, sipping at a Red Bull before setting it off to the side along with the book she'd been reading, “Something I can help you with?”

“Yeah, I broke down about a mile up the road,” He explained, rubbing his frozen hands together. “Is there anywhere open right now?”

She blew a raspberry thoughtfully as she drummed her fingers on the counter. Jarod noticed her name tag read, ‘Eunice.’ He smelled coffee and made a mental note to buy a cup to warm himself up. 

Eunice told him, “Well, there's Darner's down that-a-way. Sometimes he stays late.”

“That like a shop or…?” Jarod asked impatiently. 

He was aware that he was being prickish. However, after having the misfortune of blowing two tires in one evening, his temper was even shorter than usual. 

Thankfully, Eunice didn't seem to take it personally. She confirmed that it was a local mechanic's shop. Unfortunately, she didn't have the phone number on hand. When Jarod looked the place up, he found one, but it must've been a while since it had been updated. 

The robot voice on the other end of the line started its discouraging spiel, *“Your call cannot be completed as dialed-”*

With a heavy sigh, Jarod hung up. According to the search results, the place was only a quarter of a mile away. Not too far. 

*Guess I'm getting my steps in.*

He shoved the phone back into his pocket before questioning, “How much for coffee?”

She waved a hand, “Don't worry about it.”

Jarod blinked at her, “Are you serious?”

She shrugged, “You're cold and stranded. Least I can do. What my manager doesn't know won't kill him, right?”

At that moment, Jarod was certain he'd met an angel. A Red Bull-scented, purple-haired angel. He thanked her before taking his pity coffee out the door with him on his journey to the mechanic’s shop. It wasn't the best he'd ever drank (it had been left on the hot plate for roughly an hour too long, judging by the somewhat burnt flavor) but it was warm and free. 

No cars passed him on his hike. He truly was in bum-fuck-nowhere. How could anyone live out here? What did they do out here? Probably diddle their cousins in between tractor pulls. 

Jarod's heart sank when he saw that the building up ahead was completely dark. As he got closer, he read a sign saying, ‘Darner Auto Service.’

Even though he knew that the place would be empty, Jarod ambled up to the front door, carrying on hope that maybe someone would still be behind. Once there, he saw a few handwritten notices. The first that caught his eye was, ‘New # is (814) XXX-XXXX! Google is a liar!’ 

Jarod snorted rudely. *Yeah, real helpful, buddy.*

The second notice made him roll his eyes, ‘I don't call the cops :)’

*Real tough guy, huh?*

Jarod pounded on the door. No one answered. He got close to the window, searching for any signs of life within. Nothing. 

He swore, locating the shop's hours hanging on the door along with the notices. It was open every day except for Sunday, which was the next day. Go. Fucking. Figure. 

So he was going to be stuck here *all night?* **And** *tomorrow?*

Needing to take out his aggression on *something,* he slammed the side of his fist into the door with a loud, “*FUCK!*”

His outburst had left him panting, leaning against the door as he tried to wrangle his temper. As he collected himself, he noticed something through the window. The exact type of tire he needed. Right up front. 

Jarod hadn't stolen in a hot minute. Not since that time he'd almost gotten caught with a bottle of Captain Morgan under his jacket. Truthfully, he hadn't even enjoyed the liquor all that much, but it was rarely about the item itself. It was the rush. Heart hammering in his chest, giddy with excitement, shaking from nerves. 

It was even better when he went into houses. The idea of being caught. Wandering around undetected while they slept. *God,* it had been a while since he'd felt that alive. 

And this time, it wouldn't just be about the thrill. He had a reason. A good one. If he didn't, he'd be stranded. Probably have to sleep in his back seat for the entire weekend unless he could get Andy to return his calls. Doubtful. 

Surreptitiously, Jarod looked around, feeling that familiar flutter in his chest that no drug could replicate. No security cameras. Not a single vehicle had passed. 

He was in the middle of bum-fuck-nowhere. Who would know? 

He set the coffee off to the side to fish out his wallet, feeling around for the pins he'd never taken out, even after his scare. Good thing, too. Nothing but trouble ever came from a smashed window. He'd figured that one out at sixteen. 

Jarod tugged on the door's handle, trying to figure out what kind of locks the place had. Deadbolted. He went to work, delicately feeling for the pins within. Jarod took his time, not wanting to risk breaking his tools. Besides, he wasn't in a hurry. Who was there to see him?

There it was. Jarod pushed the door open with a huge smile on his face. 

*Beep!*

The shop had an alarm. He had to move. 

Hands shaking with adrenaline, Jarod made a beeline for the tire he needed, seizing it like it was a treasure worth millions. He wasted no time getting the hell out of there. 

In his haste, he'd forgotten his coffee cup. It sat where he'd left it on top of the trash can. 

Breathing hard and still grinning as he felt that familiar euphoria flood through his veins, Jarod hurried back in the direction of his car. Thanks to that wonderful rush, he no longer felt the biting cold. The taut, dry skin on his hands was but a distant memory. He felt *incredible.* He could take on the world. 

On his way back, Jarod stuck to the tree line. Close enough to follow the road, but far enough away that he'd be able to duck out of sight if a car came by. He doubted one would, considering that he hadn't seen another soul but Eunice that entire night, but one couldn't be too careful. 

However, about ten minutes after he passed by the gas station, he stood corrected. Headlights. Jarod withdrew into the trees with his stolen prize, feeling his pulse begin to race at the prospect of being noticed. 

It was hard to discern the make and model in the darkness, but it seemed to be an older pick up truck, judging by the square yellow lights, long bed, and boxy cab. Its silhouette resembled one of those old Rangers from the eighties Jarod's great-uncle used to swear by back when he was still coherent. 

The driver didn't appear to notice him, flying by way past the speed limit. Brows furrowed, Jarod simply kept going, glaring judgmentally at the truck's breakneck speed, even going so far as to walk backwards to continue his mean mugging. Who the fuck drives like that? An asshole, Jarod decided. Probably some redneck too eager to get to his meth lab or some shit. 

However, the question of why the driver was in such a rush was soon answered when the truck slowed down by the mechanic's shop to turn swiftly into the driveway. 

Now, Jarod's heart raced for an entirely different reason. 

“Shit!” Jarod hissed. 

First things first, he had to make sure he didn't get caught with that tire. Jarod glanced around, making note of where he was, then set the tire down, flat on the ground. He'd come back for it later. Right then, he wanted to make his way back to the gas station. At least there, he could wait until the truck's driver gave up on looking for him. 

His other option was to try to wait around in the dark, cold woods. He wouldn't dare risk trying to reach his car. For one, he still had a while to go. For another, it would take some time to get the tire changed out. And if that guy passed by again, it wouldn't be hard even for some redneck to put two and two together about where that stolen tire could've disappeared off to.

And at least if he was in the gas station, Jarod wouldn't be left to potentially face this guy alone. 

Headlights. The shop's owner was heading back towards him. 

There was no way he could've been seen, could he? Unconsciously, Jarod found himself retreating further into the trees surrounding him as he hurried back towards the gas station. He had a terrible feeling gnawing at his gut. Maybe the truck's driver hadn't seen Jarod necessarily, but his car sitting on the side of the road. 

Wings overhead. Bats? No. Wait, *crows.* Were crows nocturnal? Not important. Getting out of the open mattered more. 

The old truck passed by again. To Jarod's relief, it didn't slow down. But he still didn't feel safe. 

Even though he'd made fun of the sign on the door about not calling cops earlier, now that Jarod was actually faced with the possibility of meeting the one who'd written it, he didn't feel quite so confident. 

He began to run, occasionally tripping over twigs and roots as he raced toward the station's patriotic lighting as if it were a homing beacon. He convinced himself that he would be safe if he just made it inside. The driver wouldn't know shit. He *couldn't* know shit.  

The gas station was right there. He'd made it. Jarod passed through its front door as if entering a sacred temple. He sought salvation amongst some burnt coffee and rows of chip baggies. A most welcome communion, with the state he was in.

Now that he was within the station's walls, he wanted to laugh. Was it the woods that had gotten to him? Why had he been so paranoid? That guy didn't know shit. He just had to wait it out for an hour or two. 

Eunice looked up at him from around her book, oblivious to his inner turmoil. “Any luck?” 

Jarod shook his head, “Nope. Mind if I hang out here for a bit? Warm up?”

She shrugged a shoulder, “Sure. We don't really have anywhere for you to sit, but we're open until eleven.”

Immediately afterwards, he glanced at the clock. Nine. Plenty of time. 

The Red-Bull scented angel was even kind enough to let him charge his phone behind the counter. Never underestimate the power of a stranger's pity. 

After she rang up some beef jerky and a bottle of water for him, she went back to reading. Not wanting to bother her and wear out her goodwill, Jarod resigned himself to hanging out by the window. The windowsill was chilly, but it worked as a slightly uncomfortable makeshift seat. 

With his phone charging, Jarod's options for passing time included high-brow reading material such as a tabloid declaring that a hugely famous pop star had committed the unforgivable sin of lying about plastic surgery. As such, he resorted to staring blankly out the window as he munched on his snack. He knew eventually he would buckle and skim through the magazine out of sheer boredom, but he would hold off on consuming that brain rot for as long as he could. Lord knows Jarod didn't have much gray matter left to spare. 

He dropped a piece of jerky. Sighing, he bent down at the waist to pick it up from the clump of dust it had tumbled into. While he was down, he heard the rumble of an old motor from outside. 

To his horror, he saw an old Ford Ranger had pulled into the gas station's parking lot. 

*Fuck me.*

Dread began to settle in his stomach as he saw the driver get out. In the faint illumination provided by the lot's only working light, he scanned the guy, guessing that he was about average height. Dressed simply in a heavy brown jacket over a flannel and jeans. His hood was up, concealing his face. 

Jarod wasn't sure what to do. Stay there? Duck into the bathroom until this guy left? No. This guy didn't know shit. He couldn't. 

The little bell over the door jingled as the truck's driver strode in, immediately approaching the check out counter. Jarod didn't move, clutching his snacks and water bottle, trying not to make it too obvious that he was staring. 

*This guy doesn't know **shit.***

Eunice jumped up, setting her book off to the side and saying, “Oh hey! Just the guy we need!”

She pointed right at Jarod, helpfully announcing to God, Satan, and all others in attendance that he was having some car trouble. 

*Fuck.*

The driver turned, straight, dark brows drawn together as he sized up Jarod. In turn, Jarod was doing the same. He'd been expecting someone bigger. Scarier. Not some pretty boy. 

The corner of the driver's mouth lifted in a smile as he waltzed up to Jarod. The expression would've been charming if Jarod hadn't been able to hear his heart pounding in his ears. Distantly, he heard her mention that the guy’s name was Something Darner, just like his shop. Jarod didn't catch the first name, only the last. Once that was settled, Eunice went back to reading, not aware that she'd all but slid a noose around Jarod’s neck.

The man called Darner extended a hand politely, sounding disarmingly friendly as he asked Jarod, “You experiencin’ some trouble, son?”

*Of course* he was the type of guy to call a man the same age as him ‘son.’ Jarod had to resist the urge to roll his eyes as he accepted the handshake. He was certain that the rough skin of Darner’s fingers would tear off the dry, thin skin of his knuckles during that brief contact. 

Jarod thought it best to lie through his teeth. If he mentioned the flat tire, that would immediately arouse suspicion. Smoothly, he told a tall tale, “Yeah, my temperature gauge started going up. I’m going to give it some time to cool down.”

“Hmm,” Darner nodded once, looking thoughtful. “You notice anything leakin’ at all?”

Good. He was buying it. Just as he’d thought, this guy didn’t know shit. What had Jarod been so worried about? His pulse began to slow as he realized that he wasn’t about to spend the night in jail. He kept going, expertly weaving a tapestry of deception for this podunk hillbilly, elaborating all about how he hadn’t noticed a trail or any other abnormalities of the sort. The car had just started getting hot. No smoke, nothing. Just the temperature gauge going off. 

Meanwhile, the mechanic was keeping count. He had a spool of thread and a needle in his pocket. Each time Jarod lied to him, it would be another stitch. 

So far, Jarod was up to seven. 

“Sounds like it just needs some coolant,” Darner told him kindly with a smile. “Might have a small leak. I’m more ‘an willin’ to check it out for ya!”

He kept that pleasant, warm grin on his face as he saw the little hamster wheels in Jarod’s brain begin to turn, searching for some sort of excuse as to why he’d reject such a generous offer, seemingly with no expectations of repayment. But he’d pay up, alright. 

Jarod, none the wiser, just dismissively said, “Oh, that’s not necessary. I’m sure once it sits for a bit, it’ll be fine.”

Darner leaned his shoulder against the cold window, looking down at the other man with a click of his tongue, “If I were you, I wouldn’t risk it, son, ‘specially if you got farther to go. Overheatin’ can *really* screw up an engine. Even catch fire. You’ll be in a real tight spot, then. If money’s what you’re worried about, I’m more ‘an willin’ to work somethin’ out.”

Jarod couldn't understand why this Darner fucker was being so pushy. What the hell did he care? 

Trying not to be a complete dick, Jarod shook his head, “Seriously, it’s fine. I can just buy some coolant here and it should get me to where I’m going.”

“Figure I should tell ya now I’m the only mechanic here for the next forty miles.” Darner informed him, his concern sounding completely genuine. “If your car’s that bad, I wouldn’t recommend drivin’ much farther.”

Jarod thought fast, “Oh, well I’m going to look for a motel then call a buddy of mine to come down and help me out. He knows quite a bit about cars and he’s not too far from here, so, really, it’ll be fine.”

Ten stitches. 

Darner clicked his tongue again, leaning his shoulder against the window, crossing his arms over his chest, continuing to keep up the facade of worry. “Well, nearest one is ‘bout twenty miles north o’ here. Quite a long distance to push an overheatin’ vehicle.”

When Jarod’s face fell, the mechanic ruefully added, “Yeah, we don’t got much out here, son. Motels’re for places people actually like to visit.”

Jarod held on to his cool, his frustration growing, as well as an undercurrent of nervousness. Why wouldn’t this guy let up? Probably a bit too forcefully, he replied, “I’ll figure something out.” 

“Not tryin’ to be a pain.” Darner replied mildly. “Just don’t feel right leavin’ someone stranded, ya know?”

Was this that ‘small town kindness’ people like to get all romantic about? Well, it was fucking annoying. Save the sappy *Gilmore Girls* shit for the ladies. 

“I appreciate it, but I’ve got it under control.” Jarod all but snapped. “I’ll just call my buddy if it acts up again. He keeps late hours, so he won’t mind.”

Thirteen stitches. 

Darner gave him a small shrug and a resigned smile, “Suit yourself. You at least want my number in case you can’t get a hold of your friend? This ain’t a good place to get stranded, ‘specially not at this time o’ year.”

Jarod shook his head. “No thanks.” 

Darner offered his calloused hand again, saying, “Well, it was a real pleasure meetin’ ya, mister…?”

Getting sick of the niceties, Jarod didn’t take it, simply replying curtly with his hands on his lap. “Gerald. Nice meeting you.”

Darner chuckled, “No last name?”

Just wanting to get this fucker out of his hair, Jarod told him his surname was Campanelli. It wasn’t.  

Fifteen stitches. 

“Good luck out there.” Darner told him, sounding genuine. “And be careful.”

Jarod watched him exit, then start the old Ranger up. To his relief, the mechanic had turned the opposite direction of where his car sat waiting for him in the darkness. 

Once the truck's tail lights had faded into the gloom, Jarod glanced at the clock. Nine thirty-seven. He wanted to give it at least fifteen minutes. Make sure that Darner had actually left. It was entirely possible the mechanic had just taken another way around to wait for him. He didn't think he would, since he'd seemed to eat up Jarod's story about a cooling issue, but better safe than arrested. Or lying in a ditch somewhere. 

*‘I don't call the cops :)’*

The reminder of that note made Jarod snicker softly to himself. Where the hell did *that* guy get the delusion that he was intimidating? Come out to McKeesport, buddy. See how tough you are after that.

Fifteen minutes passed. During that time, there was no sign of that Ranger or anyone else on the road. Time to go and get out of this shithole. 

After thanking Eunice for reviving his dying phone, Jarod ventured back out into the darkness. Thankfully, the forest was quiet, now. No wings, no skittering in the trees. Blissful silence. The walk was oddly calm. 

Everything was pleasant until he got to the spot where he'd left the tire. 

He frowned at it. Hadn't he set it on the ground? He could've sworn he had. It couldn't have very well gotten up and set itself there. Jarod glanced around, looking for some sign that someone else had been here. But why would someone come and just prop it up like that? 

For him to find. 

Like bait.

When Jarod turned to double back for the gas station, he nearly bumped into a shadow. Without hesitation, he charged with his fists flying. The shadow merely ducked under his arms, seizing him around the throat, and expertly toppling him to the ground. 

Jarod's lungs refused to work after he hit the dirt. His ears were ringing. 

The shadow was on top of him, the skin of its hand rough against Jarod's Adam's apple. His assailant knelt across Jarod's waist, holding him in place. Jarod's arms were pinned beneath the shadow, the left trapped beneath his attacker's knee, the right in danger of having its wrist crushed beneath the weight of a steel toe boot.

“Don't be passin' out on me, now.” Darner's voice came from the shadow. Cold and harsh. No trace of the warmth he'd hidden behind back at the gas station. 

Jarod summoned as much bravado as he could and shouted, “Fuck you!” 

He lunged. Well, tried to. The fucker didn't even flinch. He was a lot stronger than he looked. It didn't help that Jarod couldn't move much. All his attacker did was let out a short laugh as he used his free hand to reach into his jacket pocket. Jarod's legs kicked uselessly as he thrashed, swearing and cussing as if mere dirty words could get him out of this.   

“You go on ahead and scream, son,” Darner told him, an alarming calmness to his voice that made Jarod shiver. “You ain't gonna have much to say after I'm done with you. Best get it out while ya can.”

“The fuck's that supposed to mean?!” Jarod snapped. “Someone's gonna hear me!”

They both knew that was bullshit. There was nobody around for miles, and the woods had no concern for who and what cried out from within its boundaries. 

He'd thought Darner would pull out a gun or a knife. Rather, it was a spool of white thread with an embroidery needle stuck into its top. 

At first, Jarod had no idea what to make of this. He considered making a nasty comment about how unmasculine it was for his assailant to be into sewing, but then it clicked. As the reality of his situation settled in, his struggles slowed. His eyes were as wide and round as the tire that had gotten him into this mess. 

“Nope,” Darner said, sounding as if he were smiling. “No one's gonna hear a thing.”

Fear. That's all there was left when Darner used his free hand to pinch the corner of Jarod's mouth shut. His prey thrashed, squealing like a caught doe. There was a sting in Jarod's lower lip that quickly intensified into a burn as the needle was forced through his skin. He could feel every fiber of that thread as it slid through his flesh. 

His eyes watered on their own, tears streaming down his cheeks as the needle bit into his top lip once, then again in another spot right next to it. The thread burrowed into the torn flesh like a worm. The salt on his cheeks had begun to fall down into the stitches, adding yet another, the intensity of the contact making Jarod's arms shake from where they were pinned. 

Turning his head only made things worse. Darner didn't say a single word. Merely continued to pull the thread through Jarod's skin with the effortlessness of someone who'd done it countless times. Soon, Jarod couldn't open the right side of his mouth. It was firmly stitched shut. 

He'd begun to hyperventilate, snot joining the tears as his struggles began to slow. No matter how much he'd thrashed, he couldn't get Darner off of him. The mechanic didn't even break pace for a second. Jarod's fight was completely inconsequential to him. 

Once Darner was three fourths of the way finished, Jarod had accepted that this was his fate. But then he wondered what would happen afterwards. Would Darner leave him like this? No. He wouldn't. Jarod had seen his face and place of business. 

There was no way he was getting out of this alive. This was it. 

Because of a tire.

All Jarod could do was let out a pathetic whimper that sounded more like it belonged to a sick dog than to a human. His lips were heavy and swollen to the size of blimps. They continued to sting with each movement, as if a swarm of angry wasps had been released beneath his flesh. 

Darner finally spoke again as he pulled the needle through the other corner of Jarod's mouth, his voice absurdly conversational as he asked, “Anyone know you're out here, son?”

Once again, Jarod moaned. He couldn't speak and with this sick fuck still working on him, he didn't dare move his head. It only made the pull of the threads worse. 

“One whine for yes, two for no. And I'll know if you're lyin’. 

How would he? The safe option was to say ‘yes.’ Make him think someone would notice if Jarod was gone. That someone would come looking for him. But Jarod was afraid that the mechanic wasn't bluffing and would somehow know if he was pulling his leg. 

Darner sighed impatiently as he knotted the thread, “Simple yes or no question, boy. Anyone know you're here or not?”

Against Jarod's better judgment, he moaned twice. He was too scared to find out what would happen if Darner caught him being dishonest. But in reality, he didn't think it mattered what he answered. Darner was going to kill him. There were no two ways about it.. 

Jarod just didn't want it to hurt as much. Maybe agreeability would grant him some mercy. 

There was another tug at the thread connecting Jarod's lips together as the  mechanic secured another knot. After he was done, the pulling stopped. The tension on the thread went limp as it was cut. Jarod tried to sob, but his own sealed mouth got in the way. 

Darner's hands roughly ran down his body then. Jarod's panicked struggles began anew as he began to fear that an even worse assault was coming, but then it stopped abruptly once the mechanic had found what he was looking for. He placed one hand back on his captive's throat while the other inspected Jarod's wallet. 

Darner started to laugh again, “Jarod spelled with an ‘o.’ Shit. That's a terrible name! No wonder you turned out like this.”

Jarod's mind began to swim after that, slipping beneath the surface of all he'd kept hidden about himself. His crimes were laid bare before him, each transgression examined with the cold detachment of a coroner performing an autopsy. Every cruel, unkind, or dishonest word Jarod had ever spoken. Every time he'd hurt another living being. He wanted to scream, but the stitches kept the cry of despair firmly confined between his teeth. 

Darner's cool voice broke through the onslaught of gory vulnerability, the executioner giving his final judgment, “Jarod with an ‘o,’ I can say without a doubt in my mind no one is gonna miss you.”

1hbu3xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hbu3xz/dropshipping_business/,Dropshipping Business,"Alright, let’s dive into the world of e-commerce and brainstorm some profitable product niches while also discussing how to set up your Shopify store and market it like a pro. Let’s make this fun and informative, just like a chat over coffee with a couple of friends who also happen to be budding entrepreneurs.

### Profitable Product Niches
1. **Eco-friendly Products**: Think reusable straws, biodegradable phone cases, or vegan skincare. People are getting serious about their carbon footprints, and you can ride that wave.
2. **Pet Products**: From quirky pet costumes to high-tech pet toys, this niche is huge. People love their pets like family (sometimes better), so you can never have too many options.
3. **Home Fitness Equipment**: With everyone becoming their own fitness gurus post-pandemic, think resistance bands, dumbbells, or yoga mats featuring funky designs.
4. **Personalized Gifts**: Items like custom mugs, engraved jewelry, or bespoke artwork add a personal touch—perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, and “just because” gifts.
5. **DIY Craft Kits**: Whether it’s candle-making or knitting, people are looking for creative outlets. Here’s your chance to package their next hobby in a nice little box.

### Suppliers Like Oberlo
To source these products, look for:
- **Spocket**: Great for North American and European suppliers, allowing for faster shipping times.
- **Printful**: Perfect for print-on-demand items, like T-shirts or wall art, with no inventory management headaches.
- **CJ Dropshipping**: Offers a variety of products and can even help with branding if you want to slap your logo on there.

### Setting Up a Shopify Store
1. **Sign Up**: Grab that 14-day free trial on Shopify. It’s like taking your new puppy home for the weekend before committing.
2. **Choose a Theme**: Pick one that aligns with your brand vibes. You want it to feel like a cozy, inviting space, not a cold, hard warehouse.
3. **Customize Your Store**: Use your unique voice! Add product descriptions that sing, photos that pop, and your “About Us” section that tells your story.
4. **Add Products**: Use the suppliers we discussed to import products with a few clicks. Make sure to set your pricing strategy—that markup should leave room for a celebratory pizza night when you start making sales.

### Marketing Through Facebook Ads: Action Plan
1. **Define Your Audience**: Get specific. If you’re selling eco-friendly products, target eco-conscious shoppers, young families, etc. Utilize tools like the Audience Insights tool on Facebook.
2. **Create Eye-catching Visuals**: Invest time in creating high-quality images or videos. They need to pop in the feed; think bold, beautiful, and engaging.
3. **Craft a Compelling Message**: Your ad copy should resonate with your audience’s pain points and offer them a solution. Use humor, if it fits! “You know your dog deserves bling just like you do…”
4. **Set Up Your Campaign**: Use Facebook Ads Manager to create your campaign, and don’t be shy about splitting testing different versions of your ads to see what works best.
5. **Monitor, Analyze, Adjust**: Keep an eye on those metrics. Click-through rates, conversions, engagement—you’ll need to make adjustments as you learn what resonates. It's like tuning a guitar; you might need to tweak a string or two.

### Final Thoughts
Take action and dive in! It’s easy to get sidetracked by perfectionism. Just remember, even the best entrepreneurs started somewhere, often with more mistakes than wins. Take those steps, invite feedback from your community, and continue to evolve. And if all else fails, at least you have a great story to tell! Never underestimate the journey; it’s where the real growth happens. So, gather your courage, grab a cup of coffee (or tea if you're fancy), and let’s make this happen!",1,1733925692.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

Remember how that sparkly glove wasn’t just an accessory but a statement?  Well, in ***MomPreneurs***, you’ll learn how to create your own “glove moment” in the **business world**.  Every **successful entrepreneur** has that one iconic thing that makes them stand out.  **Your business** needs a “glove” – and no, it doesn’t have to be an actual glove, but it does have to be ***fabulous***.  Whether it’s a signature service, product, or your personal flair, ***MomPreneurs*** will help you find it.  

**Final Lesson: Be the Queen (or King if you’re a man) of Your Business**

1hbu1i3,https://www.reddit.com/r/RayBanStories/comments/1hbu1i3/how_to_use_meta_ai/,How to use Meta Ai,"I’ve noticed a lot of posts and reviews where people just ask Meta AI to “look and tell me what you see.” While that’s a neat party trick, these glasses can do so much more if you use them right. I wanted to share a few ways I use Meta AI in my day-to-day life and offer some ideas to get more out of it.

How I Use Meta AI

	1.	Theme Park Navigation & Planning (Disney Parks)
I live in Orlando and have an annual Disney pass. Before I even leave for the parks, I ask for ride wait times to gauge how busy each park is. This helps me decide where to go and plan my day.
	•	While there, I check wait times to decide what we’re doing next. Super handy when hopping between rides.
	•	Walking in from the parking lot? I have Meta AI remember the lot name/number so I’m not wandering later trying to find my car.

	2.	Live Translations
In Orlando, a lot of people speak Spanish, and many signs are in Spanish too. Meta AI helps me translate signs quickly. Live translation, when it comes, is going to be game-changing.

	3.	Cooking Assistant

 Hands-free timers are a lifesaver when I’m cooking. Recently, I didn’t have a half-cup measure, but I did have a 2 oz cup. I asked the AI for a conversion, and it gave me the perfect answer on the spot. If I use up an ingredient, I have it remember what I’m out of so I can restock on my next grocery run. At the grocery store, I ask for recipe ideas and what aisles I can find specific ingredients in. No wandering aimlessly or googling mid-aisle.

	
      4. Coffee Runs

I sometimes bring coffee for coworkers just to be nice. I have Meta AI remember everyone’s specific orders so I can bring the right drinks next time. No scribbled notes or forgotten preferences.

	5. General Googling & Trivia

The glasses are perfect for hands-free fact-checking during discussions or debates with friends:

	•	“What year did Inception come out?”
	•	“Who played that one character in The Matrix?”
	•	Book discussions, trivia, or fun random questions. It’s like having instant answers in a natural, low-effort way.

Other Ideas to Try

Here are a few more use cases I thought of that might help you get creative:

	•	Daily Reminders: 

Ask the AI to remember things like “Call Mom every Thursday” or “Trash day is Friday morning.”

	•	Inventory Tracking: 

Remember what tools you lent out, where you stored holiday decorations, or even your shoe size for a certain brand.

	•	Sightseeing: 

If you’re traveling, Meta AI can identify landmarks or suggest things to do nearby.

Meta AI is incredibly helpful. I laugh a little when I see reviews where people are just saying, “Tell me what you see.” There’s so much more it can do to make your day easier and smarter if you get creative.

Let me know how you’re using Meta AI! I’d love to hear other cool ideas or tricks y’all have come up with.",2,1733925511.0,RayBanStories,0,1.0,False

I've come to prefer the taste of espresso (Americanos) and want the convenience of being able to make it at home, (although I do recognize there's a bit work involved). I will be a daily user.

If I go with an inexpensive, new machine, I'll have room in my budget to upgrade accessories, but if I buy a used high-quality machine, I'll likely have to upgrade as I go. 

So, to the questions:

- Have you purchased a used machine from a site like eBay, or Facebook Marketplace? Did it function as listed?



- Would it be better to buy an inexpensive machine like a Casabrew or Delonghi Stilista and upgrade the accessories with the remaining budget or invest in a used Gaggia and upgrade the accessories over time?



- If I do go with a used, high-quality machine, what's the life expectancy, and that of a lower quality machine (generally speaking, with daily use)?



- In regards to your own espresso journey, what would you have done differently in the beginning? Any regrets?

Appreciate any kind of help or pointers in the right direction. 

***An important note is that all this needs to be done with texts written in German.***

**The scenario for which I need AI:**

* Attendees of a course write each their own text, describing a ""perfect"" day in the future. These attendees all share the same background, most likely the same employer. That means that all texts will most likely have some common themes, e.g. structure of a work day, the way meetings run etc. But they would also have differences, unique little descriptions, maybe of a coffee break shared with a colleague.

**What I need the AI to do:**

* The number of texts can change drastically. With 3 texts it's kind of doable to merge them manually. With 10+ texts or even 50+ it can obviously become quite hard to do this by hand. The AI would need to merge these texts by merging common themes into one occurence in the final text and also adding unique wordings/descriptions.
* If merging is not really feasible to be done by AI at the moment, clustering the contents of the texts would be really helpful as well. With clustering I'm thinking about bullet points that extract quotes from each text clustered for certain topics, e.g. meetings, coffee break talk etc. This way unique wordings could be preserved.
* If none of the above is feasible, what AI would be most useful to summarize texts while still keeping some of the unique wordings?

I hope you can understand what I'm looking for. If anything is unclear please ask away. Thanks for any help!",1,1733924980.0,artificial,0,1.0,False

He told me I should go out, have fun, and spend time with my friends. As an introvert, I prefer to focus all my attention on him, and I rarely feel the need to socialize. But then he added that it’s fine if I hang out with anyone—male or female—and even grab coffee or go somewhere with them, as long as my body stays exclusively his.

He told me, “If you’re out and a guy asks you to get coffee, do it. Trust me, take advantage of the opportunities while you can. When we get real serious, you’re not going to have a lot of time to do all this other stuff. I want you to have as much fun as you can. If someone wants to take you out to dinner or be your friend, do it. Stop passing up every opportunity to make new connections, because once we hang out, we’re not going to want to be apart.”

I was hesitant about his suggestion, but being naturally submissive in the relationship, I told him “okay,” even though I have no plans to actually meet other people. I just don’t vibe with the outside world like that. His words left me questioning what he’s really trying to imply. Does he want me to live my life more freely, or is there some hidden meaning behind his suggestion?

I’d love to hear insights, especially from men, about what this might mean.

He told me I should go out, have fun, and spend time with my friends. As an introvert, I prefer to focus all my attention on him, and I rarely feel the need to socialize. But then he added that it’s fine if I hang out with anyone—male or female—and even grab coffee or go somewhere with them, as long as my body stays exclusively his.

He told me, “If you’re out and a guy asks you to get coffee, do it. Trust me, take advantage of the opportunities while you can. When we get real serious, you’re not going to have a lot of time to do all this other stuff. I want you to have as much fun as you can. If someone wants to take you out to dinner or be your friend, do it. Stop passing up every opportunity to make new connections, because once we hang out, we’re not going to want to be apart.”

I was hesitant about his suggestion, but being naturally submissive in the relationship, I told him “okay,” even though I have no plans to actually meet other people. I just don’t vibe with the outside world like that. His words left me questioning what he’s really trying to imply. Does he want me to live my life more freely, or is there some hidden meaning behind his suggestion?

I’d love to hear insights, especially from men, about what this might mean.

TL;DR: I’m confused by my boyfriend’s encouragement to hang out with others in a way that feels contradictory to my introverted nature and our long-distance relationship dynamic.",4,1733924635.0,LDR,1,1.0,False

","Giving or receiving a homemade present is extremely precious. It is more than a gift; it is a personal gesture that demonstrates thought, effort, and care. Unlike store-bought things, homemade presents have a personal touch that sets them apart. If you're looking for ways to make unique and meaningful gifts, here are some creative homemade gift ideas for any occasion.

# 1. Photo-Based Keepsakes

 Photos include valued memories, making them ideal for creating personalized gifts. You can produce a photo collage, a scrapbook, or a personalized calendar with beloved memories. Another alternative is to make photo coasters or print photographs on ornamental wood or canvas. These thoughtful gifts are perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, and family events.

# .2. Homemade Candles

 Candles are a versatile and timeless gift. With basic materials like wax, wicks, and essential oils, you can craft your own candles in various scents and designs. Add elements like dried flowers, coffee beans, or glitter for an artistic touch. Use mason jars, teacups, or decorative tins as containers, and attach a small tag describing the scent and a heartfelt note.

# 3. DIY Spa Kits

 Help your loved ones unwind with a homemade spa kit. Items like bath salts, sugar scrubs, and body butter are simple to make using natural ingredients like Epsom salts, coconut oil, and essential oils. Package them in pretty jars and include extras like a soft washcloth, a candle, or a small bottle of essential oil. These luxurious yet affordable gifts are perfect for anyone who needs a little self-care. 

# 4. Baked Goods or Recipe Jars

 Nothing says love like homemade baked treats. Whip up cookies, brownies, or a loaf of banana bread, and wrap them in parchment paper or a decorative box. Another creative idea is a “recipe in a jar.” Layer the dry ingredients for cookies or cakes in a clear jar and include an instruction card. It is a fun, interactive gift that is as beautiful as it is practical.

# 5. Handcrafted Art

#  If you are artistically inclined, consider gifting a piece of your own artwork. Paint a canvas with an inspiring quote or design something that matches the recipient’s taste. For smaller gifts, hand-paint mugs, ornaments, or flowerpots. These one-of-a-kind creations showcase your creativity and thoughtfulness.

# 6. Knitted or Sewn Items

Handmade knitted or sewn gifts add a warm, personal touch. Scarves, mittens, blankets, or tote bags are always appreciated. Beginners can start with simpler projects like dishcloths or pillow covers. Choose soft fabrics or yarn in the recipient’s favorite colors to make the gift even more special.

# 7. Memory Jars or Keepsake Boxes

A thoughtful and emotional gift is represented by a memory jar. A jar can be decorated and filled with notes about shared memories, inside jokes, or reasons the recipient is appreciated. Similarly, a keepsake box can be created to hold sentimental items like photos, ticket stubs, or small mementos. Nostalgia and connection are encouraged by these gifts.

# 8. Living Plant Arrangements

 Excellent gifts are made by plants, especially when arranged creatively. Decorated pots, teacups, or glass terrariums can have succulents, herbs, or small flowers planted in them. A handwritten care guide can be included to help the new plant thrive for the recipient. Beauty and life are brought into any space by living gifts like these.

More than just presents, homemade gifts are heartfelt expressions of love and creativity. Whether it’s a photo keepsake, a soothing spa kit, or a jar of memories, something truly meaningful can be given by these [Unique and Creative Homemade Gifts](https://sjcreativeminds.site/creative-homemade-gifts-for-any-occasion/) ideas. The time and effort put into making a gift will be appreciated and remembered long after the occasion has passed. Happy crafting!

1hbtofa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/1hbtofa/today_is_one_of_those_days_where_i_hate_not_being/,today is one of those days where I hate not being able to see properly (vent),"I’m visually impaired (legally blind) and have been all my life, so to be honest I rarely let it frustrate me or upset me - if I did regularly, I would waste a lot of time

however, today is just ‘one of those days’. I could honestly cry at how frustrated, miserable and lonely I feel

I’m just so fed up!!!

I still live with my family, and it sucks seeing them (as well as friends) just be able to go about their day. like… no having to plan, worry, make accommodations, ask for help. I’m starting to feel a bit like a pet who is always home unless I ask for a lift somewhere, assistance with something or brave it and go out alone, which often isn’t fun unless I know exactly where I’m going and what I’m doing

I joined a gym the other day and had to ask my brother to come with me and show me around. he did, but I’m just so annoyed that I can’t just join a gym and go like most people. I have to memorise the layout as I can’t rely on my eyes.

even little things when I do go out alone. I might want to go for a coffee, but all the menus are super high up on the wall! I might go to a shop, and then jump out of my skin when a store assistant asks if I need any help because I didn’t see or sense them approaching and get scared. I might be approached when out and about but the person assumes I’m being rude because I miss social cues because I can’t see or read facial expressions etc

I hate having to ask family for help because they have their own lives to live too, and I’m an adult. so I find myself staying at home more and more; luckily I’ve found hobbies and things I can enjoy to do at home independently but it still makes me feel a little lonely. especially knowing that when I do go out, I’m not that great at socialising. then when friends or extended family visit I feel so embarrassed that I don’t have much to tell them about

it’s just tough sometimes. because I’m not ‘fully blind’, I don’t have a cane, guide dog or really anything that indicates to other people I’m sight impaired. most people don’t realise I can’t see, so I don’t get much help unless I ask for it. but I can’t always see who to ask if I need it, so it’s like a double edged sword. I feel like I don’t fit in anywhere at times; strangers/people who don’t know me super well assume I’m being rude or awkward

as I said, 99% of the time I’m fine with it all. it’s just one of those things. but today I’m at home as usual, family are out, my sibling is going on a trip away, I don’t have any plans. I grew up being able to ‘keep up’ with friends and people my age but the older I get I’m finding that everyone is overtaking me (moving, travelling, dating, working etc) and I’m here just letting each day pass

sorry for the super long vent. I’m usually really optimistic but am having a rough day and thought if I post here, someone might understand. I can’t really talk to family about it because they get upset or frustrated, and friends just feel awkward",1,1733924400.0,Blind,0,1.0,False

My boyfriend jokingly said how he was getting ‘princess treatment’, which was quite funny, but believes that his driving instructor is buying him cake and coffee because they’re both from the same country so it’s cultural familiarity.

I have done my research and looked through fundraising sites and many other global-fin based apps/sites but their payout isn't Payoneer or direct bank. And the one's who do have are not available in Pakistan.

We can go to farmer's markets on the weekends, hit up every fall and pumpkin festival there is, vacations and road trips, concerts and festivals,  fireworks on the 4th, movie nights, visit all the cute towns and sip coffee in the park.

1hbtj8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/StockNavigators/comments/1hbtj8o/forex_the_wildest_ride_on_the_financial_roller/,Forex: The Wildest Ride on the Financial Roller Coaster,"Ah, Forex — the market where dreams are made, and wallets are occasionally lost in a series of very dramatic, high-speed, and borderline reckless trades. You don’t need a degree in economics to trade Forex; all you need is a working internet connection, an overactive imagination, and the belief that you’re a financial genius (or, at the very least, an aspiring one).

**The Thrill of Watching Candlestick Charts**

Nothing says “exhilarating” like staring at a candlestick chart for hours on end. Sure, to the untrained eye, it may look like a colorful bunch of tiny bars randomly going up and down. But for the Forex trader? Oh, it’s the purest form of entertainment.

“You see that tiny red candle right there? That’s the market's way of telling me to panic!” says one trader, sweating bullets as the market dips by a mere 0.0003%. Meanwhile, another trader is gleefully rubbing their hands together as their position goes up by a single pip, congratulating themselves as if they just discovered the secret to life.

**The Complex Art of Risk Management**

Risk management? Oh, it’s an art — much like playing Russian roulette, but with significantly more numbers and significantly fewer life-or-death consequences (we hope). The key is to balance your position size and stop-loss levels, while maintaining the illusion that you’re in control.

You can hear the conversation at the trading desk:

“I’ve set a 100-pip stop loss. That should be enough.”

“100-pip stop loss? Are you crazy? You’re lucky if it holds for 10 minutes!”

“Oh, I’ll be fine, I have faith. I’ve read 18 trading books this month.”

One hour later: “What do you mean my account is down by 50%? I thought I was invincible!”

**The Emotional Roller Coaster**

Forex trading isn’t just about numbers. It’s about emotions. You think you’re all calm and collected — a stoic trader, focused on the charts. But in reality, you’re one bad trade away from screaming at your screen like a character from a bad reality TV show.

It’s a loop. You’re feeling on top of the world when your position is up by 20 pips, but then one tiny dip sends you into a spiral of existential dread. “What did I do wrong? Did I misread the charts? Should I just sell everything and become a farmer?” You might even start blaming your broker. “The spread was too wide, that’s why I lost!”

**The ‘Perfect’ Trading Strategy**

There’s a magical moment when every Forex trader believes they’ve discovered the secret formula to trading success. They’ve read all the books, watched a few YouTube tutorials, and have spent hours backtesting their strategy on historical data. They’re ready.

“Finally! I’ve got it! The strategy of all strategies. This is it, the Holy Grail!”

Fast forward to their first live trade: minus 150 pips. The strategy? It’s called ""I-Got-Too-Excited-Too-Early."" Turns out, the Forex market doesn’t care how much research you’ve done. It’s the market’s world, and you’re just a very small, slightly confused player within it.

The ‘That-Can’t-Happen-Again’ Moment

You’ve been there. You place a trade, thinking everything looks great, only to wake up in the morning to see that the market has moved 500 pips overnight while you were sleeping, and your stop loss was hit during your REM cycle. “I should have stayed awake for the whole 24-hour market cycle,” you lament, as you reflect on your missed opportunity to catch that “perfect move.”

The worst part? That trade? It’s actually happened before. You knew it was coming. But, as with every Forex trader, hope springs eternal. The market will turn back in your favor... someday. Hopefully.

**The Importance of Coffee**

Let’s be real here: coffee is the lifeblood of every Forex trader. Who needs sleep when you have a fresh cup of espresso and 40 tabs open, each filled with a different Forex indicator?

There’s always that moment when you’ve been staring at the screen for hours and think, “Okay, if I just drink one more cup of coffee, I can totally predict the next market move.” Spoiler alert: coffee is not a substitute for actual research, but it will definitely keep you awake long enough to stare at your chart and pretend you know what you’re doing.

**The Family’s Concerns**

Forex trading has a special way of making you the most interesting person at family gatherings — for all the wrong reasons. You’ll explain to your relatives that you’re “working in the Forex market,” only for them to look at you like you’ve just said you’re building a rocket to Mars.

“Forex, huh? That’s like... gambling, right?”

“No, no, it’s more like... skill-based gambling,” you say, clutching your coffee mug and praying your trade will turn green by the end of the week.

And let’s not forget the classic family statement: “Why don’t you just invest in real estate?” Of course, when you suggest that they might want to take a look at the Forex market, their interest vanishes quicker than your profits during a market correction.

**Conclusion: A Never-Ending Journey**

At the end of the day, Forex is like a rollercoaster ride you can’t get off. There are thrilling highs, terrifying lows, and moments when you question why you ever decided to hop on in the first place. But we keep coming back for more. Maybe it’s the adrenaline, maybe it’s the hope of finally mastering the charts, or maybe it’s just the coffee. Whatever the reason, one thing is clear: Forex is the wildest ride in the financial world, and we wouldn’t have it any other way.

1hbtgq3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sahm/comments/1hbtgq3/i_feel_so_lonely/,I feel so lonely.,"I am so lonely. 
For some context: I’ve been married for 7 years. My husband M(40) and myself F(34) have two children as well. My second child was born during Covid in 2021. 

Since the birth of my son, I stopped working as my husband owns and manages 2 restaurants. He is out of the house every Wednesday thru Sunday 1030/11- 1030/11pm at night. Monday and Tuesdays he is home but barely does anything with me. We fight constantly. 

This past February my husband turned 40 and gave my then 2 yr old his wedding band to lose. He found it and than gave it to him a second time in hopes he’d lose it again. He did. No replacement and no care that it was lost. 

Fast forward to a few nights ago where in an argument my husband tells me none of his friends believe he is married and that no one likes me. My husband drinks when he’s at work and has made friends with his customers and somehow these peoples opinions matter. 

Mind you, he has friends and family he never makes an effort for. And I mean NEVER. 

I’m really lonely and it’s probably the most lonely if ever been. I also lost my best friend in January of this year and it’s coming up on her one year anniversary and I just have absolutely no one in my life. 

No one to tell my pain to. No one to tell my thoughts to. No one to share a cup of coffee or a meal. No one to show my children’s accomplishments to.  No one to laugh with. ",2,1733923745.0,sahm,0,1.0,False
1hbtgov,https://www.reddit.com/r/chemex/comments/1hbtgov/stalling_thoughts/,Stalling - Thoughts?,"I’ve been brewing 800g batches of Chemex for probably 10+ years consistently. Over the last several months about 2/3 of my batches have been taking 7-8 min vs. my historical 5:00 -5:30. I use good water, have increased grind size, etc. with little improvements. It’s getting frustrating. Luckily the brews still come out good, but it’s frustrating when your brewing advent calendar coffees and you know things aren’t dialed in (might need to switch to my Moccamaster for the remainder of the coffees).

At this point I think I have one of the following issues: 1) Batch of bad filters… or 2) grinder is making a lot of fines for some reason.

Setup:

50 g beans

Baratza virtuoso set to 28 of 40

800 g water

All water is stilled and then I add Third Wave Water minerals

Grinder burrs were replaced 3 years ago and I would say I grind an average of 80g beans per day (so about 195 pounds of coffee on the burrs)

Grinder was cleaned using Grindz before the start of the advent so just two weeks back 

Any thoughts?

Next step is to see if I can find some new filters and see what happens. Current ones are probably from a 2020 or 2021 production batch (loaded up during Covid when supply started to dwindle)

But over time, I’ve found myself getting jealous of a few girls he’s interacted with (this was during our relationship span). The first time, I (F21) checked his phone and found out that after we had a fight, he went out with another girl (Girl 1). They had coffee, talked, and when he got home, he texted her saying, “Thanks, I enjoyed your company.” I confronted him about it, cried a lot, but forgave him anyway.

Then came Girl 2. They were talking for about a week and went on late-night walks together. One time, she wore heels, and he gave her his slippers to walk in because she was uncomfortable. A week later, she confessed her feelings for him, but he rejected her, saying he had me and didn’t want to hurt me. He explained their interactions by saying she was struggling with her mental health, and he was just being kind. I forgave him again.

The third time was different. He told me he was going to take a nap, so I thought he was home resting. Later that night, I went to a spot by the sea and found him there with another girl. I didn’t confront him. I just went home and pretended I hadn’t seen anything. He later told me he had gone out with her and justified it as innocent. This time, he even asked for my permission to hang out with her, and I said yes, even though it hurt.

Things calmed down for a while after that, and he genuinely started putting more effort into our relationship. We spent more time together, and I thought we were in a better place. Then came the most recent situation, and I don’t know what to think.

He was part of a competition at another place and had a female partner. I saw photos of them looking close and couldn’t help but feel jealous. When I brought it up, hoping for some reassurance, he got angry instead. He said I didn’t trust him and started venting about how exhausting and toxic the event had been for him. He told me that if we ever break up, it wouldn’t be because of another person but because of what I did (suspecting him).

I apologized for making it an issue and explained I just wanted to feel secure. He apologized too, but it was too sarcastic. Now I’m stuck questioning if I’m the problem. Was I selfish for feeling jealous and asking for reassurance? Or was I justified in wanting some clarity? Am I invalidating him by not fully understanding that he was really exhausted and instead of empathizing with him, I started suspecting him? Who’s really in the wrong here?

Like almost every single are Christians. However, from middle school (2012ish to around 2021-2022), I hated everything about Christians. I just hated being forced Christianity down my throat and felt that Christians were just mentally ill idiots. Even stating my opinions infront of my siblings and my parents of hatred for Christianity. I would even occasionally slander God's name in every worse way possible, as silly as putting my middle finger up at the sky. Thinking back I was just angry that my family was struggling a lot financially, I couldn't go to college first few years after graduating high school due to that as well, constantly fighting with my family verbally and physically, unemployed, etc.

Over the last 2-3 years, I've started to just thank (not necessarily God) for every small joy I'd get. Like thanking that I was alive another day to see the sunrise. I started listening to old Christian songs, then started to see a lot of videos of Christians getting hate, so I decided to start research on my own, and since then I've felt just warmth for everything I did and said about the Lord. For every single day for a few months of thanking everything that I'm thankful for (trees, parents' health, having money to buy even a coffee). Then my life changed 180 degrees. Went from unemployed to very good paying job, failing relationship with parents and siblings to best it's ever been, 2.6 GPA in community college to soon graduating from top tech college with 3.7, failing to meet girls to meeting one of the most perfect girlfriend, having no car and even my own room to my own car and house, help getting my siblings get good paying jobs and most importantly I was able to help pay off parents debt all in 2-3 years. Now, I've grown to read Bible daily, praying everyday, and trying to live by His word. 

However, because of all the mistakes I've made regarding my hatred towards Christianity, I'm embarassed to say I'm a Christian to my parents and siblings. It's really embarassing to admit that. I don't know what I should do. No one in my life, not even one, knows I devoted my life for Jesus. I don't go to church for this exact reason.

1hbtala,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbtala,Need some thoughts on what the heck has gone on with my bridging?,"So, I’ve been designing a coffee funnel for my husband to use, which by the design requires bridging for the section holding the magnets. His portafilter isn’t standard, so I’ve needed to do some adjusting to get the right size.

I printed the first attempt many months ago (bottom right), and it was a fairly clean print after support removal. However, it wasn’t quite the right size, so I needed to resize it. I promptly got distracted by other things (work etc), and only just yesterday I got back to it. I reprinted the model I had, as I couldn’t remember if I had changed the size already or not (top right), but it turned out that I hadn’t. However, when I removed the support material I noticed that the bridging was absolute garbage! I did some searching, and thought it might be the bridging speed/flow, so I reduced the speed and bridge flow, which resulted in the middle left print (the tiny round blobs in the picture on the left and bottom are some water drops). It looks to have fixed the bridging itself to an extent, but the overhang walls still seem garbage and I can’t figure out why. Everything else is printing beautifully on the models.

I have a P1S with an AMS, and I’ve had it since May this year (40th birthday present from my hubby and kids). I’m using Bambi slicer, with Bambi PLA Basic in black. It’s a 0.4 stainless nozzle (stock) that I haven’t upgraded as yet, printing with the 0.20mm Standard profile. My only changes to the profile are to add hybrid tree supports, change the sparse infill to gyroid, bridge flow down to 0.9 and bridge speed down to 30mm/s. All are printed on a textured plate.

Would love some ideas on what’s going wrong or what I should try to fix it.

Also, yes, I could absolutely flip the print and not have to use bridging, but one - that will ruin my nice rounded top edge and require more post processing than I’d like to do, and two - would not solve my problem for any future bridging. I have noticed it on another model I have, but I didn’t realise it was a big issue until I printed this model as they were very small sections.",2,1733923196.0,BambuLab,2,1.0,False

Her response was essentially "" I'll never support your lifestyle choices, but I love you, why cant you see how im the victim here, but also I'm your mother I won't beg for a relationship with you."" Which is funny , I audibly laughed when I read it. She made no real effort to mend things between us at all. My therapist agreed she's got a severe victim complex and this isn't the sort of letter he expected from a mother who you'd think is trying to fix things. 

Anyways, according to my sibling my mom says I'm full of hate. (Because I'm queer and not part of her high control group, oh also because I don't see her as the victim in this situation.) Because I'm not bending anymore or trying to be someone I'm not. 

My dad has given me until my birthday which is next week to see him for coffee. I'm mulling it over. It would be nice to say my final peace with him in person, however I know it'd also just cause a lot of hardship for me. There's been no attempt at change between them nor any growth at all. I know it wouldn't change anything, it'd be for my solace only. But at the same time being NC with them has made me much happier and much less anxiety inducing. It's irritating being in this situation to begin with & quite frankly I don't know what to do.

Any advice is much appreciated , I know there isn't much context but thanks for reading.  ",2,1733922799.0,EstrangedAdultChild,2,1.0,False

[https://www.reddit.com/r/HelluvaBoss/comments/1hb15pw/helluva\_boss\_origins/](https://www.reddit.com/r/HelluvaBoss/comments/1hb15pw/helluva_boss_origins/)

We start off with another flashback, this time to the day Blitzo and Stolas met, back when both were just kids; The day was Stolas' 6th birthday, and his father Paimon (Andy Serkis) gave Stolas his grimoire and told him how he would one day inherit the throne of the Ars Goetian king, alongside his arranged-wife  Stella.Then, he sent Stolas off to Buckzo's circus, where he met Blitzo and the two became best friends. However, after that day, they never saw each other again.

  
Flash forward to present day, a now-adult Stolas (Benedict Cumberbatch) decides to call up Blitz so they can catch up over drinks. Blitz brings along the rest of the I.M.P. crew, who get left at the Ars Goetian manor. Meanwhile, Stolas' daughter Octavia (Jenna Ortega) has been preparing for the event of Azazoth's tears: An event resembling a meteor shower that Stolas told her about when she was just a child. She's been keeping the date for the event for many years, however, she becomes upset after discovering her father left to go get drinks with Blitz. Wanting to see the stars, she ends up stealing Stolas' grimoire (which he *stupidly* left at the manor) and tells it to take her to ""see the stars"". The grimoire ends up teleporting her elsewhere just as Moxxie, Millie and Loona walk in, the room is silent until Moxxie remarks ""The prince is going to be PISSED when he gets back.""

  
Sure enough, when Stolas gets back and learns what happened, he's fairly pissed. So he and the I.M.P. crew head off to go and find Octavia, who they soon learn thanks to Loona's incredible scent-detecting abilities is actually in L.A. Meanwhile, Octavia finds herself in L.A. and quickly rushes off onto a tour bus, believing due to a pamphlet that it will ""take her to see the stars"".

  
The I.M.P. Crew and Stolas arrive in L.A., where Loona and Stolas don human disguises, which (having never been to Earth before), Blitz and the M&M's don't have human disguises, so Blitz resorts to a costume shop for his disguise. However, it works a bit too well, and Blitz is mistaken for comedian Rane Ronalds, it gets to the point that Blitz is essentially kidnapped by a few agents from a television studio. However, Stolas manages to convince them that he is ""Rane's agent"", so he gets thrown in the back of the car with Blitz. As the car speeds off, Blitz tells Moxxie, Millie and Loona to find Octavia.

  
Meanwhile, Octavia is upset as the tour was ""nothing like the pamphlet"", as she walks into an alleyway, she gets attacked by a street gang. Thankfully, she is saved by a surprise guest--- her mother's brother Andrealphus (Kelsey Grammar), she tells Andre of the situation, and he agrees to help get her to the stars.

  
Moxxie, Millie and Loona look around L.A. for Octavia, while we discover that Moxxie is planning on using the excursion to propose to Millie. Meanwhile, Blitz is forced onto the set of a sitcom ""Honey! I'm inside of the  building that we live in!"" which gives him flashbacks to his last performance, making him very against the whole thing. However, Stolas manages to convince him that he'll do great, and, after making a few (very un)funny quips, he decides to keep playing along after seeing how much the audience loves him.

  
Andrealphus takes Via to his ""apartment"" (really a rotting shack on the other side of the city) and begins planning to cast a spell that will transport the two of them to the stars. Octavia is excited, though things turn south quickly when Andre knocks her out, and takes her unconscious body upstairs. Meanwhile, Blitz is continuing to play along, he's expected to act out a scene where a family adopts Uggie. This causes Blitz to be reminded of how, for the first couple months of her living with him, Loona had trouble sleeping due to the trauma of having killed her own father. This causes Blitz to be reminded of his daughter, and he refuses to give Uggie to the acting family, this causes an argument that ends in Blitz killing the entire family onstage. The crowd is sent into a panic, and Blitz and Stolas are forced to flee, narrowly avoiding being caught by the police.



Meanwhile, Moxxie, Millie and Loona continue their search for Octavia when they come across Verosika Mayday (Blake Lively), Blitz's succubus ex who is not very fond of him. She is joined by her hellhound bodyguard Vortex (Ray Fisher), who Loona instantly falls for. Loona is so lovestruck by Vortex that she, unlike Moxxie and Millie, doesn't notice Andre speeding off with an unconscious Via in the passenger seat. So Moxxie and Millie have to drag her off as they head off to tell Blitz and Stolas what they've found.

  
Blitz and Stolas sit on top of a building, Stolas blames himself for the situation, believing himself to be a ""horrible father"". However, Blitz tells Stolas that he's not a horrible father, he knows he's trying, and that sometimes, a child just can't see how much their parent truly cares for them. Just then, Moxxie, Millie and Loona show up and tell Blitz and Stolas what they've found (Okay, it's mostly Moxxie and Millie, Loona's just pissed that they dragged her away from Vortex.). Stolas is furious and proceeds to tell the I.M.P. crew Andre's story: He was angered by how well Stolas and his sister Stella (Rachel McAddams) interacted as a couple, so he attempted to murder Stolas in his sleep one night. However, he was caught and banished to Earth by Paimon. With that, the I.M.P. crew and Stolas head off to stop Andre and save Via.

  
Meanwhile, Via wakes up and finds herself in Andre's car. She demands to know what's going on and Andre reveals to her that he plans to use her as bait to lure out Stolas so he can kill him. Then, he will move to Paris with her. Via attempts to break free, only for Andre to pin her to the passenger seat using his ice powers. As Andre looks in the rear-view mirror, he sees Stolas and the I.M.P. crew chasing after him. He speeds up the car, leading to a Blues Brothers-style car chase ending with Andre's car crashing into a hot dog stand. However, Andre is persistent, and ends up hijacking said hot dog stand before driving it off to the airport. Needing a car of their own, the I.M.P. crew and Stolas hijack a pizza van and use it to chase after Andre.

  
This eventually leads our heroes to the airport. Andre, not wanting to be seen by any mortals, sneaks onto the plane via the baggage conveyer belt. However, little does he know that the I.M.P. crew and Stolas see him and end up following him. Via makes one last attempt at escape, only for Andre to shove her inside a suitcase and send it off to a plane. Stolas and Andre fight while the I.M.P. crew use various equipment pulled out of the suitcases as weapons to assist Stolas. In the end, Andre is defeated and the I.M.P. crew lock him inside a suitcase and put it on a plane headed to Alaska. With Andre defeated, Stolas and the I.M.P. crew have to find a way onto the plane Via is trapped inside, using a piece of string Moxxie has in his pocket, he and Blitz climb up the side of the plane Batman '66-style, while Millie and Loona break a hole in the bottom of the plane, allowing Stolas to climb inside the luggage compartment and rescue his daughter. He and Via embrace, with Stolas relieved that she is okay, he then questions why she ran off. Octavia reminds him about his promise to take her to see Azathoth's tears. Having been caught up in his reunion with Blitz, Stolas had forgotten all about it. He apologizes to his daughter, who forgives him and says she's glad that he's here now. Suddenly, fireworks shoot up in the sky, and Octavia takes the time to enjoy the moment. Just then, Blitz and Moxxie open up the hatch at the bottom to allow Stolas and Via to escape the luggage compartment. However, they are spotted by the people on the plane, leading to chaos that causes the plane to begin to crash. Thankfully, Millie and Loona manage to fly the plane to a safe landing spot (but not without quite a few casualties). They end up landing the plane on Verosika's limo, giving Blitz the chance to mock her before he, the rest of the I.M.P. crew, Stolas and Via return to Hell as Verosika shouts ""DAMN YOU, BLITZOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!""

  
Back in Hell, Blitz and Stolas work out a deal: Blitz is allowed to use the grimoire as a means to travel to Earth to kill more targets, and in return, he and Stolas will meet for coffee once every month. Meanwhile, with some assistance from his usual aggressor Loona, Moxxie proposes to Millie, and she excitedly agrees.

  
In a post-credits scene, we see two D.H.O.R.K.S. agents (Bill Hader and Lupita Nyongo \[apologies if I pronounced her name wrong\]) looking at some photos of the I.M.P crew's misadventure in L.A., and decide that they need to investigate these ""demonic abominations"" further.

I just wanted to share my situation and get some advice. This is the second year in a row where my rent has increased more than my salary. With the latest increase, my salary went up by £1,100 per year, but my rent rose by £1,800. And that’s without even considering the rising costs of food, transport, and other essentials.

Over the past four years, I’ve felt like I’ve been working for nothing, and I’m starting to get really tired of this situation—fighting against a tsunami of price increases. I feel like I’m getting poorer. I think twice before grabbing a coffee in the afternoon, and my wardrobe hasn’t changed in ages.

The frustrating part is that I’m considered to be in a good position: working for a tech company with a good salary. Is anyone else experiencing the same thing?

I would appreciate more of an insight from men (can't post on askmen yet).
If need some clarification please ask my mind is a mess sometimes!

Objective part of the question:
It has been brought to my attention that I am very naive when it comes to myself in relationships (but can see it clearly with others) and probably get love bombed and then manipulated a lot and then also I can't differentiate if someone is really genuinely busy or not interested in me because I get obssesive when I like someone/have a crush (I know, working on it) and then if the person isn't like that about me I think he is not interested but I realised what if he is just ""normal"" and I am not used to that and percieve it differently??

I have no man to ask that either they are too young/unexperienced  or gay so. 

The scenario that made me ask:
There is a guy as mentioned who for like a month at least was obviously interested me,  messaging me evedy day goodmorning and goodnight. I reciprocated and sometimes messaged first if I managed to before he sent a message. We were talking about going for a coffee at least and chat alone. We videocalled 2 times.  Then he stopped saying goodmornings etc and didnt message that often saying he is busy  (he had an afternoon shift and in the mornings goes everyday to a gym and was genuinely stressing about the jobs etc). I even asked one time after more than a week of nothing if he stopped talking or if something is up, and he said no that he is just busy. 
Never been outside just the 2 of us though. Always in the end it was a group friend meeting and drinks. 2 times after such a group event we kissed. We always have fun talking etc. He is absolutely not a good texter and said so. 
After the last time outside which was like a month ago he didn't message for a week, he was in dealings with documents about changing Jobs etc and then went for a family trip. I tried to message and he answered then I tried to wait if he will reach out himself and he did after a week, now again the same. After the last time we were talking to meet up or plan something so we can have privacy aswell after he comes back from the trip and he starts a new job but since nothing mentioned. 
The friend group was supposed to go for a movie but in the end it was about to be just the 2 of us and he said so and I said that I am okay with that if he is? And it was all good and the day of the movie in the morning  (movie in the evening) he said that his friend will join (a woman) and if I am okay with it and I said that sure not my call. I hoped that he will kiss me again when saying goodbye like he did 2 times before after the movie but nothing and that honestly made me sad. We only hugged (as always) but the other friend he didn't hug at all so idk.

I feel stupid and silly even writing this all out but it made me realise that I honestly don't know what is healthy or normal cause I started with trauma in every aspect of my life..

I don't know if I am just used to both sides being immediately obsessed and trying to hang out asap and as much as possible or what. As far as I know it is not like he is meeting the other friends etc.

So yeah sorry for the ramble I will appreciate any tips on how to navigate percieving actions I guess or how to differentiate what is normal and what is not interested or what is suspicious love bombing on the other side. Even his 2 friends when I was with them alone said that he smiles when he talks about me and that they think he is interested etc and I feel so dumb believing that and letting them feed my delussion

1hbspk4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hbspk4/im_i_the_wrong_one/,I’m I the wrong one?,"So for context I’ve been on a weird sleep cycle where I fall asleep early and wake up around 2:30 to 3 am but yesterday I was asleep for most of the day because I woke up around 1 am and stayed awake for awhile until I eventually crashed. So yesterday was a bad day and I didn’t get anything done but the past few days I’ve been doing pretty good. After waking up this morning at 3am I came downstairs around 5 because I heard my parents awake, I came downstairs and immediately my stepfather started berating me about how he mopped the floors and he expected that since I saw him do that I would clean something but I didn’t. He was yelling extremely loud for 5am and thought about our neighbors and how it might wake them up, after saying I was in the wrong and that yeah I messed up he kept going and I said this is ridiculous that he’s being this loud over this. Of course my mom joins in and yells at me. This is the first interaction I’ve had with them today. He starts yelling at us to stop talking everyone shut up and I say something about how loud he’s being and he leaves the house screaming and slamming doors yelling outside and drives off. I have a talk with my mom where I just say that it’s not fair that you gang up on me even though it’s not her argument and that it should stay between me and him since me and her have been doing pretty well recently and that if me living in the same house is gonna work that we need to communicate to each other instead of just yelling because we’re all adults and I’m not gonna be yelled at over something so small. He comes back, I tell him that yeah I was wrong yesterday I should’ve cleaned something and could’ve been better but I want to move forward and be better in the future. He then completely ignores that and continues on with the argument pointing out the dishes my mom left and pinned it on me, a dirty toilet I already cleaned and the fact I didn’t take out the trash one time. I keep telling him how we need to just talk instead of yell because he keeps yelling at this point, I’m pretty much just defending every slight he  thought was a slight and was instead a misunderstanding but he doesn’t care. At this point I’m yelling too and it isn’t getting anywhere so I just stop talking and my mom comes in to intervene trying to calm it down. He starts saying something about how he gives up and that there’s no point. And all I say is how he just gives up and wants to ruin the family over something fucking dishes and we go back and forth for a second and then he gets all lovey dovey out of nowhere to my mom makes her coffee and plays the symphony card, they hug for an uncomfortable amount of time saying how much they love each other and how he was only telling me to clean and how I don’t respect the house. At this point I watched this and completely thought that this was so manipulative and saw right past it. He pretty much took all his negative emotions then transferred it on me and now I got to get rid of the emotions by myself like every single time. I’ll also add that they both are “disabled” which over the years I’ve noticed my mom isn’t really and just uses it as an excuse to get out of things or situations and cash in on the checks without doing anything. My stepdad on the other hand does have a hearing disability but doesn’t wear his hearing aids at all meaning we all have to work around that. Honestly it just seems like something to make me feel guilty all the time, oh you’re disagreeing with your disabled parents. They even have a handicap parking pass that makes me feel disgusting because they can both walk just fine. I can barely stand them and just want to move out but every time I bring it up it’s met with, no no find a house we can buy so you don’t have to rent and waste money. Yeah it sounds great and it’s a great place to be in for them to do that but on the other hand it also feels like a way to control me, they already told me I’m raising my family in the house I’m living in now even though I don’t want that at all and never thought to tell me about it. Just feel completely controlled and even when I admit to being wrong and wanting to change they don’t care snd instead just want to scapegoat me.",2,1733921330.0,Advice,1,1.0,False
1hbsp0c,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1hbsp0c/the_lack_of_compromise_and_the_sudden_coldness/,The lack of compromise and the sudden coldness feels like it'll never leave me,"We (in hindsight stupidly) decided to have a breakup two months down the line, knowing we still really wanted to see each other until she left the country indefinitely and that was the only reason we wanted to break up. A few weeks later asked to move it forward so she could heal, obviously I was upset but I wanted her to be happy and knew it was best for her and I didn't want someone to feel obliged to be with me. The only caveat was it was close to a concert the two of us were going to. My one request was that we saw each other another time after that so we didn't break up on the day of the concert, ruining one our favourite bands.

The day before the concert, all of a sudden there's a miscommunication about what that final day was and that they thought we were breaking up on the concert day despite it being the only thing I asked for. It was basically a case of ""Like it or lump it"". I then tried to move the ""final final"" day to the day after the concert so we could still end it earlier like she wanted to but not mar the memories of the band, to which she said that would be ""unfair"" to her because she already had plans to hang out with a friend post-breakup. She also put it back on me by saying ""I thought you said you would never want someone to stay with you longer just to make you happy?"" completely ignoring I was asking to meet on a Monday and break up rather than a Sunday, while also getting rid of the meeting on the Thursday. She gave me the option of breaking up after the concert and having a coffee on the Thursday to just get some closure (ironically while telling me she wanted a clean cut, but wants to meet me for a coffee a few days later which only prolongs the breakup while I wanted it to be done and stay on good terms?) or just end it now. Neither that I had consented to.

I had asked friends who call me out on my BS what they thought of the texts and they made it clear to me that my brain was clouded and she was being dismissive of the fact there are two of us in this relationship. I was very careful to word things in a way that were reassuring and making it clear I wanted us to end well because we both really wanted that. I understood her feelings and was still willing to budge things as long as my one boundary (the concert day) was respected and that I've compromised before and trying to find a compromise here but it feels one-sided atm. And I do understand the prolonged breakup was harder for her than for me because of how her BPD affects her. 

But the ugly side came out - completely cold response again, no apology for making me feel that way despite me constantly being lectured on that in the past, making it feel like I was a nuisance rather than someone she cared about. I was really upset and that night I sent her a message to say it's better ending it now then than going to the concert and ruining my night. I tried to make the message as fair as possible, but making the point that I felt I'd compromised a lot and that I didn't really want to end it in this manner, but it's the only solution I've been given. 

I was blocked on everything without a response and until the next day where I received a message that effectively started with ""well I compromised because I definitely stayed with you longer than I wanted to"" - despite never telling me that and after me giving her the opportunity a couple of weeks earlier to end it. Then ends it with a generic ""I am sorry for my mistakes and I forgive you for yours and hope we can start healing and move on"", not engaging at all with why I was so hurt. Blocked me again and will likely never read the response I gave her.

At the end of the day, the lack of compromise was bad, but something I can understand and forgive with time knowing that for her, this was also a brutal time in her life; but the manner in which she spoke to me and ended things, I don't think I'll ever be able to forgive. It's weird how quickly your opinion can change on someone and also how heartbreaking it becomes when it feels like they never really cared how you would feel at the end, as long as they got what they wanted.",5,1733921277.0,BPDlovedones,3,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Are you curious about the impact of teeth whitening treatments? Understanding the transformation that takes place before and after these procedures can greatly aid in decision-making, whether you’re considering it for yourself or just seeking to learn more about the process. The visual results of teeth whitening can be captivating, making it one of the most sought-after cosmetic dental procedures today.

Let’s take a closer look at what you can expect in your teeth whitening journey.

### Before the Treatment

Before undergoing any whitening procedure, it's essential to start with an assessment of your oral health. Here are some things you should consider:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Consultation:** Schedule an appointment with your dentist to discuss your goals and expectations. They can provide tailored advice based on your specific needs.
- **Examination:** A thorough examination will help identify any dental issues such as cavities or gum problems that should be addressed prior to whitening.
- **Color Evaluation:** Dentists often take a shade guide to compare your current teeth color with desired shades, giving you a measurable goal.

You may also notice that your teeth appear more stained than your ideal shade. Common causes of tooth discoloration include coffee, tea, red wine, and smoking. Understanding the reasons behind your tooth color can help you make informed choices about whitening options available.

### Choosing a Whitening Method

Once you’ve had a consultation, you’ll need to choose the best whitening method that fits your needs. Here are some popular treatments:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **In-Office Whitening:** A professional treatment performed by a dentist, which can yield immediate results within a single session.
- **At-Home Kits:** Custom trays and gel solutions provided by a dentist allow for gradual whitening over a couple of weeks.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These include whitening strips, gels, and toothpastes available at pharmacies that offer a more accessible but often less potent effect.

Each method comes with unique advantages and potential drawbacks. For example, in-office treatments usually produce dramatic results quickly, but at a higher cost compared to over-the-counter options.

### During the Treatment

Your experience during the whitening treatment can vary based on the method chosen. In-office treatments may involve:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Preparation:** Your dentist will apply a protective gel to your gums and soft tissue.
- **Application:** A whitening agent, often containing hydrogen peroxide, is applied to your teeth, and in some cases, a special light is used to enhance effectiveness.
- **Observation:** The dentist will monitor the process to ensure optimal whitening while protecting your mouth from any discomfort.

For at-home solutions, the application is typically straightforward. You'll place the gel in custom trays and wear them for a specified duration each day for about two weeks.

### After the Treatment

Once you complete the whitening treatment, prepare for a striking difference. Before and after photos often reveal remarkable transformations. You might see:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Brightened Color:** A noticeable enhancement in the whiteness of your teeth, often several shades lighter.
- **Boosted Confidence:** Many individuals who undergo whitening treatments report feeling more self-assured, leading to better social interactions.
- **Enhanced Aesthetics:** A brighter smile can significantly improve your overall facial appearance, making you look younger and more vibrant.

However, you should maintain your results by practicing good oral hygiene and being mindful of foods and drinks that can stain your teeth. Regular dental cleaning and occasional touch-up sessions can also help keep your smile looking its best.

Ultimately, the transformation you experience from teeth whitening is both visual and emotional. From assessing your current dental state, choosing the right method, to enjoying a luminous smile, your journey can be rewarding. Armed with knowledge, you can approach teeth whitening with confidence and make informed decisions that suit your personal goals. Remember, it’s not just about the look but also about feeling great in your own skin.

Comparing Natural vs. Professional Teeth Whitening Results
----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brilliant smile, many people consider teeth whitening. Whether through natural methods or professional treatments, the journey to a brighter smile can vary significantly in results. This article will guide you through the differences between natural and professional teeth whitening results, so you can make an informed decision.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Understanding Natural Teeth Whitening

Natural teeth whitening typically involves using ingredients and methods found in your own kitchen or local health store. Some of the most popular options include:

- **Baking Soda:** Known for its mild abrasive properties and ability to remove surface stains.
- **Activated Charcoal:** This trendy option binds to stains and debris, lifting them away from the enamel.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Often used in diluted form, this substance can effectively lighten teeth.
- **Fruits and Vegetables:** Crunchy veggies like carrots and apples can act as natural toothbrushes, while strawberries contain malic acid, which can help whiten teeth.
- **Oil Pulling:** Swishing coconut or sesame oil in your mouth may reduce plaque and help whiten teeth over time.

While these natural methods can lead to some improvement, the **results** may not be as dramatic or quick as professional treatments. Many users find that consistency is key. Regular use of these methods can help maintain the whiteness achieved through more intensive methods.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Exploring Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening usually takes place at a dentist's office or involves at-home kits provided by a dental professional. The key benefits include:

- **Stronger Agents:** Dentists use higher concentrations of bleaching agents, such as hydrogen peroxide, which provide faster and more noticeable results.
- **Custom Treatments:** Your dentist can tailor the treatment to your specific needs and oral health, optimizing your whitening experience.
- **Immediate Results:** Many in-office treatments provide immediate results, often lightening teeth by several shades in just one visit.
- **Expert Guidance:** The supervision of a dental professional reduces the risks of side effects and ensures that the process is safe for your enamel.

Professional methods can often yield long-lasting brightness, but they typically come at a higher cost than natural methods.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Comparing Results

Now, let's directly compare the effectiveness of natural versus professional whitening:

- **Speed:** Professional whitening shows noticeable results in a single session, while natural methods can take weeks or even months for visible changes.
- **Shade Improvement:** Patients often achieve a smile that is several shades brighter with professional treatments, while natural methods may result in minimal change.
- **Cost:** Natural whitening methods are generally inexpensive or free; professional treatments, however, can range from $300 to $1,000 depending on the procedure.
- **Safety:** Professional whitening is performed under the supervision of a dentist, reducing the risk of enamel damage. Natural methods can vary in safety, with some abrasive ingredients potentially harming enamel when used excessively.
- **Longevity:** The results from professional whitening tend to last longer compared to natural methods, which require ongoing maintenance.

### Which Option is Best for You?

Your choice between natural and professional teeth whitening depends on several factors, including:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Your Budget:** If cost is a significant concern, natural methods might be the more appealing option.
- **Time Frame:** If you're preparing for an event, professional whitening could provide the quick results you need.
- **Oral Health:** If you have sensitive teeth or gum issues, it's essential to consult with a dentist before attempting aggressive treatments, whether natural or professional.
- **Desired Results:** Consider how white you want your teeth to be and how quickly you want to see those results.

The journey to a white smile doesn't have to be confusing. By weighing the options of natural versus professional teeth whitening, you can choose a method that aligns with your goals, budget, and lifestyle. Remember, a beautiful smile is not only about the color but also about maintaining dental health!

### Conclusion

Teeth whitening can be a game-changer for many individuals looking to enhance their smiles. The transformation witnessed in before and after experiences often serves as powerful motivation for those considering the treatment. Whether it’s a special occasion, a job interview, or simply the desire to feel more confident, the impact of a brighter smile is undeniable.

In comparing natural versus professional teeth whitening methods, it's clear that each option has its unique benefits and limitations. Natural methods, often heralded for their gentle approach, can offer gradual results but may require consistent effort and time. On the other hand, professional treatments yield faster and more dramatic results, making them a popular choice for those who want immediate change.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Ultimately, the choice between natural and professional whitening methods comes down to your personal preferences and goals. You'll want to consider factors such as cost, time, and sensitivity. Remember that every smile is different, and what works for one person may not be suitable for another.

Regardless of the method chosen, the key takeaway is that teeth whitening can lead to a noticeable difference that boosts not just your smile but also your self-esteem. Embracing your teeth’s potential is just a treatment away, and with a bit of research and consideration, you can find the right path to achieve the stunning results you desire. Your journey from before to after can be both exciting and rewarding, leading you to a brighter future, one smile at a time.

I'm coming to Vancouver this christmas visit my husbands family and introduce our 2nd kid to them all. I'm Australian and I love to seek out the best of food everywhere I travel. I can give you some proper lists in some random countries.

Husband and I own and run a small brewery here in Australia and it's just been so insanely busy trying to juggle newest human to the family and business at the busiest time of year that I can't do my usual extensive (and i mean extensive) googling to find all the epic eats Vancouver has to offer.

So what's something to recommend? Doesn't have to be a restaurant. In fact I usually just chase like something singular. for example was in Glasgow and google told there's a place that does the greatest Portugese Custard tart. Went all the way to find it, it was epic.

All I've got so far is:

La Belle Patate for Poutine (a must, husband is scottish and loves poutine - our brewery serves it)  
Northern or Templeton for Diners.

Two things. Which is terrible by my standards. I usually have mass notes on my phone. 

What's something to travel around Vancouver for? stuff like: Best burger? Best bakery? Best beer bar? Best coffee? Best whatever you think...donut? Beavertail? I'm keen to try whatever.  
  
Thank you in advance. So excited to see a place I've wanted to go to since I was like 5. I stupidly chose to do my working ski season in small ski town in America to avoid the half of the Australian population in Whistler, wish I'd come to your fine country instead.

I know I got a little grumpy with you the last time we spoke but I was having a bad day and once I managed to get out of my funk, I apologised to you. You didn't need to block me. That hurt so much as I felt that I meant nothing to you. I wish that I could turn back time and not be grumpy to you. It's been almost 12 weeks since we last spoke and I miss our late night chats and, dare I say it, I miss you too. I can't get you out of my mind. I know I should move on but I can't forget you. I felt that we shared something great, and I'm not talking about those things we talked about which I have not, and will never, told anyone else about, but I felt that we have a deep connection that has been present since the day we met 7 and a half years ago. At times it felt that we were reading each other's minds when we were together.

I know we never went beyond the flirting stage, but I can't help but feel hurt that it never went anywhere but, as we are both busy with work and other things, we couldn't find the time to meet up, and when you get in contact with me again, if you want to start over, I'm willing to talk as it'll be nice to have a coffee together (and you know how much I love my coffee. lol) and a catch-up on a day that we're both off from our respective jobs. We've known each other too long to let a silly argument get in the way of our friendship.

For now, take care

1hbsdhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/gratitude/comments/1hbsdhw/what_are_you_grateful_for_today/,What Are You Grateful For Today?,"What Are You Grateful For Today?

What Are You Grateful For Today?                               So with Thanksgiving behind us and Christmas right in front of us, it makes us think of what we have and what we are  grateful for.
If you follow me you know I am not a believer in ""days"" to do certain things.

Why can't we be grateful every day? Why is there one specific day that we must do it on? It is way too much pressure to be perfect, to come together, and for many to pretend we like each other. Come on let's be real here, with the holidays, we will be getting thrown together with family we may not care for.     We all have that one relative that just gets under your skin. That has asked you for years why you're still single or why you haven't lost weight while you're trying to swallow your turkey and keep that fake smile on your face while you're doing it.
Or that one cousin who always is bragging about what they have, always trying to make you feel like a loser. Yes, one day a year puts too much pressure on people to have to pretend that they are grateful.

I am grateful each and every day, but it hasn't always been this way. I had to teach myself this. I had to actually dig and find things to be grateful for as I was in such a miserable place in my life. I remember when Oprah started her gratitude journal, and she wanted all her viewers to do this as well. I thought I'd try but there was nothing besides my girls that I was grateful for. Yes, it was that bad, so I started with the basics that most of us already have.
I was grateful that I woke up.
I was grateful for a home.
I was grateful for having food.
I was grateful for a car.
I was grateful for my and my girl's health.
I was grateful I could walk.
I was grateful I could see.

Look, I was really reaching here because there wasn't much else I was grateful for.
But each week I added something, being grateful for a walk on the ocean. Seeing birds in the sky, a warm cup of coffee on a chilly day, and before I knew it, I started being grateful for everything. 
Every morning on the way to work I give thanks for the life I have now. I cry because I am so grateful. 

Being grateful opens you up to other blessings and it's not just me saying this. ""In positive psychology research, gratitude is strongly and consistently associated with greater happiness. Gratitude helps people feel more positive emotions, relish good experiences, improve their health, deal with adversity, and build strong relationships"" says Harvard Health.

Even scientists know this is a real thing, having gratitude changes your life. So then why do we only have one day to be grateful? A day that is so stressful for so many to have everything perfect, to come together with relatives you don't like, with people that drink too much or never shut up, and now you want us to be grateful? It seems so phony to me. I don't care about Thanksgiving, in fact when the girls were young and I was divorced I did Thanksgiving on Friday so they could spend the actual day with their dad and didn't have to feel like they had to pick or be without the other parent. 

Did it matter that it wasn't on Thanksgiving for me? No, I am grateful for having dinner with my girls and my friends every single time we sat at my table. And so what if it wasn't on Thanksgiving what did that mean? That I wasn't as grateful? No, because having to do something and wanting to do something are two very different things.
I chose to be thankful, not just on Thanksgiving or during the holidays when they tell us to, but every day. Sometimes every moment because I know how precious life truly is these last few years.

So today my friends remember we don't need a day to remind us to be grateful. We need a life to do that, a life that we are grateful for at all times, a life that we take nothing for granted, and no matter what happens we can always find something to be grateful for.

Between my tiny little flat and my university campus, I didn't spend a lot of time anywhere else. Other than the walk, of course, which ate up an hour and a half when I had classes. I hadn't given the antique shop more than a cursory glance, despite passing it twice a day, nearly every day, for almost three years now.

But today was different. The display had changed, as it did every month, when the shopkeeper decided the tired old trinkets on display weren't going to attract anyone else, I guessed. Usually, it was an incohesive mass of dusty junk, but today was interesting. I stopped, hooking my thumbs into my backpack full of sketchbooks and art supplies, rocking back on my heels to take it all in. 
The display was a testament to adventure and travel. There was an old brass telescope, a sextant, and an exquisite ship-in-a-bottle, along with a compass, made of copper or brass, gleaming like it was brand new on a pillow of purple velvet. It was particularly pretty, and even from here, I saw the ornate needle pointed north, pointing toward me. That was a clever move on the shopkeeper's part. 

Draped over a leather stool were lace opera gloves and an ornate mask that appeared to haved been stolen from a rococo princess' bedchambers. A steamer trunk, battered with time and age, squatted in a corner, the heavily stickered front propped open just enough for more lace and silks to peep out the crack. A tired, dull machete lay, naked tip down, in a corner, along with a necklace that looked like Aztec gold draped around the hilt. 

The university recently announced a Halloween ball, and some of these items would make for interesting costumes. After all, when everyone was a neurotic creative of one brand or another, myself included, it did well to stand out. Everyone was already discussing the ornate masks they would carve or sculpt, the period-correct costumes they could sew. 

I took a special interest in the mask; showing up as someone to make Marie Antoinette scoff at the sheer flamboyance gave my little artist heart joy.
So, I went in, knowing full well I probably couldn't afford anything properly antique. Behind me, the door closed as if on a gentle spring.
""Good afternoon,"" a woman greeted. She was an antique herself; skin like crepe paper and white-silver hair swept into a style that fell out of favor forty years ago. ""Can I interest you in anything?""

""I have a party coming up, and I wanted something unique to wear,"" I admitted. ""I really like the mask in the window.""

""Oh, yes, that's a fantastic one. I bought it in Italy some time ago, and finally decided to part ways with it. In fact, most of that display is part of my personal collection."" She beamed like accumulating old junk was a crowning achievement, but then again, it was kind of her bread and butter.

My smile, already small, faltered. ""That sounds expensive.""

""Some, yes. I see you quite often, passing by, but I don't remember you coming in. Students don't usually have a lot of spare money, so maybe we can work something out. Give you a bit of a break for once. You look exhausted, dear.""
I was tired, but it was unnerving to know it was visible. 

As she pulled the mask from the display case, she told me about the woman it belonged to. A widely known opera singer, so beloved by her fans that she only wore masks in public so no one would know her true face.

The only one who did know was the mysterious man she fell in love with. He'd been so enamored with her voice that he dared speak to her after a concert, and from that day ,he was hooked. He loved her charm and wit, and even not knowing her face, he was persistent in his courtship. 

She handed me the mask; it was heavier, and more beautiful, than it looked in the window.

 I turned it in my hands. ""Oh.""

""It always gives more weight to something, when you know the story, doesn't it?"" She smiled, cheeks wrinkling.

""Do all these objects have stories?""

""Every one of them. Antique stores are like libraries; full of stories and adventure and mystery, happiness and sadness."" She laughed. ""I'm a librarian for all the tales that aren’t deemed important enough to write down.""

“That’s really kind of charming,” I mused, putting the mask on.

“Darling, you look like you were made for it,” the storekeeper gasped. “But I couldn’t possibly let it go without the compass, you know. They aren’t meant to be separated again.”

“The compass?”

“The one that belonged to the courtier of the opera singer. Oh, yes, she thought it was true love. You can’t keep that apart. Just like you can’t keep an artist from creating.”

“How much for both?” I asked, steeling myself for the hefty sum surely to follow.

“A dollar. But you must return after your party to tell me how it went. That’s my price.”

“Only a dollar?”

“And a story. I like those more, you know.” She smiled, eyes crinkling.

When I was little, my grandmother taught me how to sew. These days, I spent a lot of free time in my flat, sewing things to sell to pay my rent. Because of this, I was in the craft store a lot, and I’d picked up a lot of designer fabric when it went on sale. A particular bolt would match my new acquisitionperfectly, and as I slipped the mask on for inspiration, I knew something great was about to happen.
	
It hit me, like a ravening hunger, a feverish desire to create, to make something worthwhile. Inspiration buzzed through me, sending my brain into overdrive as idea after idea crashed into me in undulating waves.
	
It was a day and a half later when I snapped out of it, when my hunger was finally sated. I sat back, breathing heavily against the wall of my apartment, staring at the sewing mannequin wearing the most elegant ballgown I’d ever seen, all chenille and lace and satin, truly fitting for a rococo princess. Behind the mask, my eyes traveled across my apartment, scattered with page after page of artwork that I didn’t even remember sketching. I had never been sucked into the creative space so deeply and absolutely before. The dress and art appeared as if by magic, but the cuts, charcoal, and callouses on my hands told a different story. I just didn’t remember getting them, which normally would have concerned me, and yes, I did miss a class or two, but everyone needs a mental health day once in a while. Clearly, I needed some time to do what I do best and make something that gave me joy. 

Joy wasn’t quite the right word, though, it didn’t feel full enough. I felt whole, but as soon as I removed the mask, the feeling, ever so slowly, began to dwindle. Maybe I was just too excited about the Halloween party now, and getting to show up in that glorious costume I made myself. I couldn’t wait. The excited buzz still danced over my skin.

I set the mask on my coffee table, alongside the compass, and began counting the days until the dance.
With a week to go, I sat on the sofa, bored with the show I was trying to watch, and got the itch to make something again. The mask seemed to be my lucky charm, so I picked it up and put it back on. Instantly, the hunger returned, that empty void needing to be filled by the act of creation, and I inhaled. Well, perhaps some painting was in order.
I woke up, curled in a painting sheet that was thankfully mostly dry and clean, other than a blue blotch on one corner. I didn’t remember falling asleep, but then again, I didn’t remember painting one, no, two…

I continued counting, nervous sweat beading down my spine. I’d gone through my entire collection of spare canvas, at least a dozen, a bedsheet hung in the living room, and one wall of my dining area. It was all my best work, though, and my heart swelled with confidence and satisfaction. Remembering the mask, I removed it to ensure I hadn’t gotten any paint on it. It was safe, and I laid it back on the table. How long had I painted? How long had I slept? 
The clock on the wall said 7:45, and it was too bright to be evening. Oh good, I hadn’t missed class, even if I had been up half the night.

Or…for two days, if my phone was correct. There was no way. Had I fallen that deeply into my inspiration again? My stomach rumbled as if to fortify the claim. I put off eating to shower, washing the paint that clung to my hands and bare feet, the adrenaline rush wearing off again. Now, I was just tired, but I forced myself to attend class, trying to make sense of what had happened twice now. I’d worked too hard to flunk out, but I couldn’t argue with the results of my creative fugue. 

I did remember small bits, splashes of memory, from my time creating those two occasions. Pricking my thumb on a needle—one of the sketchbook pages was filled with a self-portrait smudged in my own blood—after cutting miles of silk ribbon, pulling out the canvases, being upset when I ran out. But they were just shadows and snippets. Just enough to convince me I wasn’t going insane. But firmly at the root of it all, was the memory of the mask. Maybe the opera singer’s spirit was my new muse? I didn’t know, but though it was a little scary to have so little control over myself once the bug to create bit, it was also exhilarating. I’d felt less burnt out and run-down than I had in months, and it was amazing.

***

The compass accompanied me in my little clutch to the party. It seemed wrong to leave the courtier at home when the starlet went out. I kept the mask off for a while, allowing myself to get past security before sliding it on and opening the door. Once I entered the gymnasium, the world transformed into a spooky forest of gnarled trees carved out of foam and hanging rubber bats. A fog machine belched green and silver mist over the floor, parting in the wake of my dress.

I forgot to mention that I am not very popular. No one swooped in to meet me, no one called my name from across the room. No one offered to dance with me, or get me a drink. You needed friends for that, and I hadn’t really made any. I’d been too busy, too invested with my studies, too in my own head, I guess, for that. But I’d still wanted to come; Halloween was my favorite holiday, other than perhaps Christmas.

A hollow hunger entered me, starting in the pit of my belly and creeping out, making my skin buzz. I wanted to create, but I wasn’t sure what. There wasn’t anything here I was used to working with. A scratching sound came from my clutch, and in my confusion I was almost afraid I’d open it to find a mouse inside. Purses normally didn’t sound like that.
The sound grew louder when I looked inside, discovering the compass needle spinning wildly. Almost as if realizing it was spotted, the needle snapped in my direction, despite that not being North. Directly at me. I shifted a little on my feet, angling ever so slightly to the right. The needle remained fixed. I exhaled shakily, taking it out. 

A burst of energy rushed through me and into the compass, which swing wildly again before pointing towards the east wall, and the door nestled within it.
Looking around, my heart beat a tattoo against my ribcage. Should I…follow it? In amongst the fog and foam trees, people mingled, but none paid any attention to me. 
	
Why not? What else was there to do when a mysterious compass, received for free from a junk shop, starts moving of its own accord but to follow it, especially on the night the veil between worlds was thinnest? Or that was the story of Samhein, anyway, as far as I remembered. I really wasn’t good at history. Which might not work in my favor if this didn’t end well.
	
Cupping the compass to my chest, I followed it, weaving through the crowd as the needle rocked in the direction of the door. Well, at least it was specific, the direction shifting as I left the gym. The heels of my buckled shoes clicked on the worn tile of the school’s hallway, which was more a ghost town than the spooky forest, no one else here in this wing. The compass led me to the wood shop, where tools and unfinished projects lay strewn over the thick workstations. I still felt inspiration coursing through me, looking for an outlet, but this didn’t feel like my normal kind of medium. I passed the compass over the table, where the needle indicated a sharp knife, probably used for whittling, a handful of nails, and a hammer. I threw them into my clutch, and the compass, satisfied, pointed me in a new direction. My throat felt tight, but my heart still pounded. This was a real adventure, and I had no idea where the compass would lead me next.

	
I was home when rose out of the creative fugue wearing the mask always seemed to inspire me to enter. My muse, the opera starlet, and my finder of inspiration, the courtier, had done me well. I felt…well…good.
	
A newspaper lay on the table, innocently folded to diplay the headline. 
COLLEGE STUDENT FOUND BRUTALLY MURDERED IN SUPPOSED HALLOWEEN SATANIC RITUAL. 
I pulled it closer and skimmed the article. The student, no one I recognized the name of, was found in the woods near the school…nailed to a tree to maintain a pose, skin scribed with intricate scrollwork.
	
“No,” I breathed. I was afraid to look down, to confirm what I feared, my gut writhing. I closed my eyes, then inhaled deeply and reopened them, steeling myself for what I was about to see.
	
My dress, my beautiful dress, was covered in crimson drops and splashes. There was a nail tangled in some ripped lace. I vaguely remembered grabbing the tools off the bench, but after that, my memory was just a blank void.
	
“What did I do?” I breathed, but not before a tingle of memory, of coursing inspiration, of doing my best work no matter what the cost, flowed through me. 

That was what passion felt like, wasn’t it?

1hbsa25,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_penwoodfurnitureca/comments/1hbsa25/how_mennonite_furniture_brings_character_to/,How Mennonite Furniture Brings Character to Toronto Homes,"Toronto, one of Canada’s most vibrant and diverse cities, is home to a wide variety of architectural styles and interior design trends. Whether you live in a contemporary downtown condo, a spacious suburban house, or a charming townhouse, the furniture you choose plays a key role in defining the atmosphere of your home. Among the many design choices available, Mennonite furniture has emerged as a timeless option that adds warmth, authenticity, and a touch of history to Toronto homes.

[**Mennonite furniture**](https://penwoodfurniture.ca) is recognized for its craftsmanship, durability, and connection to the tradition of fine woodworking. Originating from the Mennonite communities, primarily in Ontario, the furniture offers a unique blend of simplicity, function, and beauty, making it a popular choice for homeowners who appreciate high-quality, handmade pieces. In this article, we will explore the various ways that Mennonite furniture brings character to homes in Toronto.

# The Charm of Mennonite Furniture

Mennonite furniture has a distinctive character that comes from its emphasis on craftsmanship, natural materials, and timeless design. Rooted in the values of Mennonite communities, the furniture is handcrafted by skilled artisans who prioritize quality over mass production. The result is furniture that’s not just functional but also a work of art, created with attention to detail and an appreciation for traditional techniques.

One of the most striking features of Mennonite furniture is its solid wood construction. Unlike mass-produced, particle-board furniture, Mennonite furniture is made from hardwoods such as oak, maple, cherry, and walnut, all of which are known for their strength, beauty, and long-lasting durability. Each piece of furniture is built to stand the test of time, often becoming a family heirloom passed down through generations.

The use of natural materials is another defining characteristic of Mennonite furniture. These pieces often showcase the unique grain patterns, colors, and textures of the wood, which gives them an organic, rustic feel that enhances any living space. Whether you are drawn to the rich hues of cherry wood or the warm, golden tones of maple, Mennonite furniture adds a natural charm that can transform any room into a welcoming, cozy environment.

# Mennonite Furniture: A Blend of Tradition and Modernity

One of the reasons Mennonite furniture has gained popularity in Toronto homes is its ability to blend traditional craftsmanship with modern design sensibilities. While the furniture remains grounded in its roots, many artisans have adapted their techniques to meet the demands of contemporary interior design.

Toronto homeowners who appreciate clean lines and minimalistic designs can find Mennonite furniture that fits seamlessly into their modern spaces. The simplicity of Mennonite pieces, with their unadorned surfaces and understated elegance, allows them to complement a variety of design styles, from Scandinavian-inspired interiors to industrial chic spaces.

For example, a solid wood dining table can serve as the centerpiece of a modern dining room, offering both functionality and visual appeal. Pairing this table with minimalist dining chairs creates a balanced and harmonious look that blends traditional Mennonite craftsmanship with a modern aesthetic. Similarly, Mennonite bedroom furniture, such as a beautifully crafted bed frame or wardrobe, can add a touch of natural warmth to a sleek, contemporary bedroom.

The versatility of Mennonite furniture makes it an excellent choice for homeowners who want to infuse their spaces with character while maintaining a fresh, modern atmosphere.

# Durability and Sustainability: A Long-Lasting Investment

In today’s world of disposable furniture, investing in high-quality, sustainable pieces is becoming more important than ever. Mennonite furniture is built to last, and it is a perfect choice for those who prioritize long-term durability and environmental sustainability.

Solid wood furniture, like that crafted by Mennonite artisans, can last for generations with proper care, making it a far more sustainable option than mass-produced, low-quality furniture that needs to be replaced every few years. Additionally, many Mennonite furniture makers are committed to using ethically sourced wood and environmentally responsible practices, ensuring that your furniture purchase is both beautiful and environmentally conscious.

For homeowners in Toronto who are looking for furniture that stands the test of time, Mennonite furniture is a smart investment. Its durability means that you won’t have to worry about frequent replacements, while its timeless design ensures it will never go out of style.

# Adding Character to Your Home

Mennonite furniture is not just about function; it’s about creating an atmosphere that reflects your personal style and values. The handcrafted nature of each piece gives it a unique, one-of-a-kind quality that can’t be replicated by mass-produced furniture. When you choose Mennonite furniture for your Toronto home, you are investing in pieces that carry a story – the story of the artisans who created them, the history of Mennonite woodworking traditions, and the story of how those pieces will become a part of your own family’s narrative.

Incorporating Mennonite furniture into your home allows you to add character to your space, creating a sense of warmth, authenticity, and connection to a rich cultural tradition. Whether you choose a handcrafted dining table for family meals or a beautifully crafted bookshelf to display your favorite books and treasures, Mennonite furniture brings a level of craftsmanship and personality that elevates any room.

# Perfect for Toronto’s Diverse Homes

Toronto’s real estate market is known for its diversity, with homes ranging from modern high-rise apartments in the downtown core to more traditional houses in the surrounding neighborhoods. Mennonite furniture is well-suited to all types of homes, offering versatility and the ability to complement various architectural styles.

In a downtown Toronto condo, for example, a sleek, solid wood coffee table or an elegant dining set can add a sense of warmth and texture to an otherwise minimalist space. In suburban homes, the sturdy, handcrafted furniture creates a welcoming atmosphere, perfect for family gatherings and everyday living. Mennonite furniture fits beautifully in any home, enhancing its unique character and style.

# Why Choose Mennonite Furniture in Toronto?

Mennonite furniture is the perfect choice for homeowners who value quality, craftsmanship, and timeless design. Whether you’re renovating an existing space or furnishing a new home, the warmth and beauty of Mennonite furniture can elevate any room. Its durability, sustainability, and unique character make it a wise investment for those looking to create a home that reflects both style and substance.

In Toronto, where design trends and lifestyles constantly evolve, Mennonite furniture provides a refreshing counterpoint to fast furniture trends. It is a testament to the beauty of craftsmanship and a sustainable choice for homeowners who want to make a lasting impact in their homes.

For those seeking premium Mennonite furniture in Toronto, Penwood Furniture offers an exceptional selection of solid wood pieces that reflect the high standards of craftsmanship and design that Mennonite furniture is known for. With a focus on quality, durability, and style, Penwood Furniture is a trusted name for homeowners looking to bring the warmth and character of Mennonite furniture into their Toronto homes.

1hbs9jt,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1hbs9jt/my_phen24_review_pros_cons_and_comparison_with/,My Phen24 review: Pros & Cons and comparison with other night-time fat burners,"**Quick Summary:** As someone who has experimented with numerous weight loss supplements over the years, I found Phen24's day/night approach quite innovative. While not a miracle solution (no supplement is), **I found** [**Phen24**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phen24.php) **to be a well-thought-out system** that supports weight management goals when combined with proper diet and exercise. The inclusion of essential vitamins and minerals in both formulas adds value beyond just weight management.

**Value for Money: 4/5**

**Effectiveness: 4/5**

**Ease of Use: 3.5/5**

**Overall: 4/5**

**The Good:** If you're looking for a comprehensive weight management solution, the dual-formula approach really makes sense. During the day, I noticed increased energy from the caffeine and guarana combination, which helped me stay active. The cayenne pepper component seems to help with appetite control - I definitely felt fuller between meals.

**The night formula is where this product really differentiates itself.** Unlike many stimulant-based supplements that can interfere with sleep, I found the night formula actually supported better rest. The **L-theanine and 5-HTP combination** helped me wind down naturally while still supporting metabolism.

**Areas for Improvement:** The day formula's effects aren't immediate - it took about a week before I noticed consistent results. If you're sensitive to caffeine, you might find the morning dose a bit strong (150mg plus guarana) but for most people the **150mg caffeine content** shouldn’t be a problem though. The requirement to take 4 capsules for the night dose feels excessive, and some people might struggle with this.

If you have issues with caffeine, I recommend **non stimulant supplements like** [**Hourglass Fit**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/hourglassfit.php).

**Who It's Best For:** If you're looking for a 24-hour approach to weight management and don't mind taking multiple pills, this could work well for you. It's particularly suitable if you've tried single-formula supplements without success.

**Who Should Avoid:** If you're sensitive to stimulants or have trouble swallowing pills, you might want to look elsewhere. Also, if you're just starting your weight loss journey, you don’t expect miracles and pair this supplement with lifestyle changes.

**Where to buy:** I recommend **only buying from the** [**official website**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phen24.php). You get a better deal in buying in bulk, which is available only from official website.

# How to Lose Weight with Phen24: My Hacks & Tips

Based on my experience with Phen24 and years of weight loss trials, here are my top strategies to maximize your results:

**Morning Routine:**

* Take your Phen24 Day formula with a protein-rich breakfast. I combine it with a **whey protein shake (about 25-30g protein, under 200 calories)** and black coffee. Sometimes I also add in psyllium husk. This triple combo of Phen24's caffeine, protein's satiety effect, and coffee helps control morning hunger.
* Stay hydrated! I add sugar-free lemonade packets to my water jug - this helps maintain blood sugar and fights cravings without adding calories.

**Meal Strategy:**

* I save most of my calories for dinner since Phen24 Night requires taking it 15 minutes before evening meals. This works well because I'd rather deal with hunger during the day than go to bed hungry.
* **Focus on protein and vegetables at every meal.** I've found this combination gives the most satiety per calorie, especially when taking Phen24.
* My **go-to dinner is chicken and broccoli** \- high protein, high fiber, keeps me full. I make it tasty with seasonings and a small amount of cheese.

**Supplement Synergy:**

* Take a multivitamin in the morning to ensure you're getting all nutrients while in a calorie deficit
* Consider adding omega-3 supplements if you don't eat much fish
* If you're still struggling with hunger, glucomannan fiber supplement 30 minutes before meals can help (just keep drinking water throughout the day)

**Exercise Timing:**

* I do my workouts during the day when I have Phen24 Day's energy boost
* Focus more on resistance training than cardio - it helps preserve muscle while losing weight
* Aim for 8-10k steps daily – Some people find this more effective than intense cardio sessions

**Important Tips:**

* Track everything in a calorie tracking app - **aim for about 500 calories** below your maintenance level
* Don't rely solely on Phen24 - it's a tool, not a solution
* Stay consistent - I don't do ""cheat days"" as they can spiral into cheat weeks
* Get adequate sleep - Phen24 Night's formula works better when you maintain good sleep habits

**Warning Signs:**

* If you feel jittery, reduce your additional caffeine intake
* If you're not sleeping well, take the Phen24 night formula earlier in the evening
* Listen to your body and adjust accordingly

**Remember:** The best weight loss plan is one you can stick to long-term. Phen24 can help, but it works best when combined with sustainable lifestyle changes.

**Final Hack:** Keep your ""dinner plates"" in storage and eat from salad plates - this simple portion control trick has been a game-changer for me while using Phen24.

# Who should try Phen24? Will this work for you?

If you are looking for a product that fits into a busy lifestyle and offers 24x7 weight loss support, **Phen24** is a decent investment!

Generally I would advise consumers to pinpoint strongest ingredients in a product, and buy those individual at bulk prices from places like Bulksupplements, to get a better deal & value for money.

But with Phen24, the 2 bottle formula is quite comprehensive with diverse, varied ingredients that work on multiple fronts.

Phen24 differentiates itself from **other nighttime fat burners** with its dual-action formula, providing metabolic support during the day and fat-burning benefits at night, a feature not commonly found in competitors like **Lean PM**, **Night Shred**, or **RevBurn PM**.

While others focus solely on the ***sleep-induced fat-burning process***, often incorporating melatonin for sleep support, **Phen24**'s stimulant-free night formula aims to enhance sleep quality without the risk of **dependency on melatonin**.

Its comprehensive ingredient list and the added value of daytime support position Phen24 as a more holistic weight management supplement compared to its counterparts, which may cater more to users with specific needs such as improved sleep or stress reduction.

**But, make sure if it aligns with your goals and circumstances.**

**In Summary:**

* [**Phen24**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phen24.php) is best for those seeking a 24x7 fat burning, **full day-to-night solution** and are wary of melatonin.
* [**JackedFactory Lean PM**](https://amzn.to/3OKd1fM) is suitable for individuals who need help with sleep and prefer a supplement that aids in nighttime fat burning.
* [**Innosups Night Shred**](https://amzn.to/3ZuXDJe) is ideal for those who want to enhance muscle recovery and reduce stress as part of their weight loss plan. Also has GABA.
* [**RevBurn PM**](https://www.walmart.com/ip/RevBurn-PM-Her-With-Chamomile-Night-Time-Fat-Burner-RevLabs-Promotes-Deep-Rem-Sleep-Recovery-Stimulant-Free-Metabolism-Support-30-Capsules/909193312) is for those who are interested in a variety of natural fat-burning ingredients with special focus on sleep support.

**Phen24** stands out among nighttime fat burners for its unique 24/7 approach to weight management, offering both **daytime and nighttime formulas (without habit forming melatonin)** to support a full cycle of weight loss activities.

The day pills are like your daytime warrior, packed with ingredients that fire up the metabolism, helping you burn more calories while you conquer your daily grind. Then, as evening falls and the pace of life slows, the night pills take over.

The night pills are formulated to reduce evening cravings (we've all been there, right?), promote relaxation, and prepare your body for a night of restful sleep, which is when the real magic of recovery and fat burning happens.

# My Evaluation of Phen24 Day & Night Formulae

Here is my evaluation, keeping in mind that the supplement comes in 2 formulae- daytime & nighttime.

**Phen24 Daytime Formula Evaluation**

* **Appetite Suppression: 3/5** The presence of **caffeine and guarana** may offer moderate appetite suppression, though individual responses can vary.
* **Metabolism Boost: 4/5** Ingredients **like zinc and cayenne powder** are known for their metabolism-boosting properties, making this formula quite effective in this category.
* **Energy Enhancement: 5/5** With caffeine and guarana extract, the day formula is likely to significantly enhance energy levels for most users.
* **Stimulant-like Effects: 4/5** The stimulant effect is strong due to caffeine, but not overwhelming, hence the high score.
* **Fat Burning: 3/5** The fat-burning potential is there with ingredients like cayenne powder, but fat burning also heavily depends on diet and exercise.
* **Safety Profile: 3/5** While generally safe, the stimulants present may not be suitable for everyone, especially those sensitive to caffeine.

**Phen24 Nighttime Formula Evaluation**

* **Appetite Suppression: 2.5/5** **Glucomannan** contributes to appetite suppression, but its effectiveness can be less pronounced than the daytime formula.
* **Metabolism Boost: 2/5** The nighttime formula focuses less on metabolism and more on relaxation and sleep.
* **Anti-Stress: 4/5** The inclusion of ingredients like hops extract, which may improve sleep quality, can help in reducing stress levels, making it quite effective for relaxation.
* **Sleep Quality: 4/5** With ingredients such as hops extract known for their sedative properties, the nighttime formula is likely to contribute positively to sleep quality, aiding restfulness and recovery.
* **Fat Burning: 2.5/5** The nighttime formula supports overall weight loss efforts but doesn't directly target fat burning as the day formula does.
* **Safety Profile: 4/5** With a focus on sleep and less on stimulants, the nighttime formula is likely safer for a broader user base.

**Overall Phen24 Evaluation**

* **User Reviews: 4/5** Reviews are generally positive, with users reporting satisfactory results, though experiences vary.
* **Price ($69): 3.5/5** The price point is relatively high compared to some other weight loss supplements on the market.

**Potential Side Effects**

Like any supplement, Phen24 isn't free from potential side effects. The day formula contains caffeine, so if you're sensitive, you might experience jitters or trouble sleeping if you take it too late. Always a good idea to watch your coffee intake if you're popping these pills.

Some folks might also experience mild digestive issues when starting any new supplement, including Phen24. It's your body's way of saying, ""Hey, what's this new thing?"" If I were trying it out, I'd start during a chill week to see how my body reacts.

**Price, Guarantee, and Where to Buy**

Phen24 isn't the cheapest weight loss supplement on the block. A month's supply will set you back a bit $69,, but if you buy in bulk, there are discounts that can ease the sting. They offer a 60-day money-back guarantee, which is a nice safety net if you're just testing the waters.

You can buy [**Phen24 directly from their official website**](http://links.cambridgewellbeing.org/out/phen24.php), which I'd recommend to avoid any fakes. Plus, they often have deals and promos, so keep an eye out for those. Just make sure to factor in the cost of shipping, depending on where you live. It's not available in stores, so if you're the type who likes to see a product before you buy, this might be a drawback.",1,1733919756.0,HealthTrendz,0,1.0,False

The unusual pattern of precious orchid leaves puts them in a special position among other variegated plants. In the photo: Roxburg's anectochilus.

Gem leaves

Like gems, precious orchids are scattered around the Earth from Asia to South America. They are valued not for the flowers, like most other orchids, but for the extraordinary beauty of the leaves. The leaves of precious orchids are really amazing: colorful veins bizarrely flow along the velvety ""medallions"". It seems that these veins are lined with tiny pebbles, which sparkle in the directional light. And the thinner the patterns, the more noticeable their brightness, the stronger the flicker that occurs at the slightest movement.
         
The photo on the left shows a fragment of the Roxburgh annexochylus sheet. The silver color to the edge becomes dark. On the right is the epidermis near the veins.

It is customary to refer representatives of different genera of the orchid family from the subtribe of Goodyerinae to precious orchids (Jewel orchids). These are Macodes, Ludisia, Dossinia, Anoectochilus, Goodyera, Zeuxcine, etc. The geography of these plants is extremely wide: China, India, Japan (cold-resistant forms), Brazil (leafy forms), Vietnam. They are common on the islands of Indonesia, New Zealand, New Guinea. Simple forms are also found in Russia.
         
The leaf of anectochillus regalis is painted with thin luminous patterns, which are cast in different colors - from yellow-copper to silvery-white. The shape of the sheet is adapted for easy draining of raindrops. In the photo below: a drop on the tip of the sheet.

Precious orchids grow on mossy boulders in open places and on fallen trunks overgrown with mosses. You can meet them on the slopes of the mountains: some bask under the sun's rays, others, on the contrary, are hidden under the foliage. But they all like high humidity and relatively low temperatures.

Plants differ from each other in the color of foliage (light green, almost black, light cherry, silver, etc.), the color of the veins, the pattern and intensity of their location. Very often the leaf pattern depends on the conditions in which the orchid lives and its age. The flowers are small, collected in brushes, more often white. Some of them have a pleasant aroma. In nature, orchids freely interbreed with each other, so it is sometimes difficult to determine the type of plant.
         
The leaves of the macodes seem to be sewn from pieces of green brocade of various shades, stitched with sparkling gold or silver threads. In the photo on the right: a drawing of veins.

The habitats of these strange flowers have their own mysteries. Thus, after the Vietnam War, Roxburg's anectochylus disappeared, and only recently it was found again. In Japan, some decorative species of brocade orchids (as precious orchids are called there) disappeared for centuries and still were and resumed in culture. It was found in the mountainous regions of Ceylon and since then there was no heirostiles orchid, or ""gray mouse"" in nature.

A bit of history

The beginning of the history of precious orchids in Russia is associated with the name E. L. Reggel, a naturalist who mentioned them in his books.

In 1899, ""living jewels"" amazed the visitors of the International Gardening Exhibition in St. Petersburg. Strange anectochyluses from tropical Southeast Asia were presented by our compatriot F. I. Kekhli, who successfully grew them for many years at home under glass caps and in special glass balls.

In the twentieth century, the development of the culture of these plants is associated with the name of another collector - N. A. Berseneva. Thanks to it, unique decorative varieties of precious orchids were preserved, which no longer exist for one reason or another in nature. It was he who was one of the first to master the difficult culture of growing these ""caprices"" in an ordinary Moscow apartment and made them popular among connoisseurs of rarities. The collection of precious orchids collected by him has been repeatedly awarded world awards. Only anectochylus with a golden-white mesh on the leaves, there were more than 100 varieties in it. The anectochilus with a pure white stripe in the center of the green leaf, which received the conventional name ""spider"", was distinguished by its special beauty. The pride of Bersenev's collection were the hybrids of Roxburgh's anectochillus and regalis's anectochillus.

Unfortunately, not all varieties of precious orchids have been preserved to this day. Let's hope that students and colleagues (primarily the author of the article. - Editor's note) will preserve these amazing plants and our descendants will have the opportunity to admire the unique miracle of nature.

Secrets of precious orchids

These flowers are mysterious in many ways. Let's start with the fact that precious orchids are literally transformed when they get into the room. In nature, it is sometimes difficult to see them among the fallen foliage. They are stained with mud, eaten by insects and almost devoid of a pattern on the leaves. After months and years of painstaking cultivation in the apartment, orchids begin to sparkle like precious stones in the hands of a jeweler. With each new sheet, a new, more intricate drawing opens.
      

Anectomaria is a hybrid of anectochylus with hemaria. And anectochylus, which received the conditional name ""spider"".

The unusualness of precious orchids is that it is difficult for them to choose optimal conditions for keeping. In nature, for example in Vietnam, they can withstand quite high temperatures, and in room conditions they can hardly tolerate 26-27oC. Apparently, in natural conditions they grow in symbiosis with endemic mushrooms, which allows them to be under the forest canopy almost in the dark, among fallen leaves and moss. Another fact: in nature, orchid seeds germinate easily, in room conditions it is possible only in special flasks with a selected medium. The vulnerability of precious orchids growing in the room before the mushroom rot remains unclear, and it is from these plants that the strongest fungicides are now isolated.

Practical advice for every day

It is easiest to grow ludizia (gemaria) at home: it grows well on the windowsill and is not so demanding to air humidity. In winter, this plant does not need to be additionally illuminated with fluorescent lamps, but in summer, protection from direct sunlight is mandatory.

Plants are planted in transparent cansers with holes in the bottom. Pieces of foam with a layer of 3-4 cm are used as drainage. The substrate consists of fresh chopped sphagnum moss with the addition of top (red) peat, leaf soil (preferably from beech), green pine needles, birch charcoal and foam. You can limit yourself to only one fresh moss. Preliminary moss is treated from snails, immersing it in water heated to 40-42oC. From above, the substrate is covered with pure sphagnum moss, its shoots are placed vertically, ""heads"" up. Due to the continuous, wick, water rise, moss creates high humidity, forming a special microclimate around the plant. Containers with plants are placed in a greenhouse made of transparent plexiglass. It is placed on low stands on the floor or placed on a window facing north. The temperature is maintained within 20-22oC. The greenhouse is ventilated once every two or three days. With additional lighting with daylight lamps for 12 hours a day, the plants grow quickly, look good and do not get sick. They are watered with warm boiled water as the moss dries. Orchids practically do not need fertilizing.

In the photo: the epidermis of the upper side of the leaf near the veins (a) and its back side (b) - cells (bean-shaped) are visible, through them gas exchange and evaporation of water occur in the plant; below (c) - the tip of the leaf.

Thanks to hybridization technology in the future, it may be possible to get new plants of extraordinary beauty that feel great in apartments, and everyone will be able to buy a live ""jewel"" in the store. But will these plants retain their chim and uniqueness then?

1hbs635,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hbs635/aitah_for_not_being_happy_about_the_birthday/,AITAH for not being happy about the birthday present my husband was planning,"My husband and I have a problem with birthdays. I took him out to a fancy restaurant for his and got him a gift the first year we were together. He did nothing for my birthday. It bothered me but I figured he wasn’t that into celebrating birthdays and hadn’t asked or expected me to do anything for his so maybe I made too much fuss over him.  Anyway after that I never bothered with his birthday but I was still always upset when he did nothing or next to nothing for mine. A couple of times he bought me flowers or chocolates but that’s it.

So this year, after a few very strained years of our marriage, I decided to try and revive birthdays. Partly to show him that I care and partly as a test to see if he cared enough to reciprocate for me. So I got a babysitter, booked a restaurant and picked him up from work and we had dinner together. I even used a gift voucher for the restaurant that I had won because I didn’t want to upset him by spending too much on the evening, especially since he didn’t expect anything and money is a little tight. We had a nice evening. 

When my birthday rolled around he wished me happy birthday and gave me a kiss as he left for work in the morning. In the evening it was clear he had no gift for me. It was impossible that there were plans because that would require a babysitter which I would have had to organise. But anyway I served dinner and afterwards asked him not to disappear down to his manage because we would be having cake in a few minutes. He disappeared anyway and when I was ready to bring out the cake I sent a kid down to tell him we were doing cake. He didn’t arrive so we went ahead, the kids sang happy birthday to me and we ate cake. Later he came up and had some himself. I was upset and let him know when we went to bed.
I kept hoping he would do something for me on the weekend but no. I kept my distance for a few weeks and didn’t have sex with him. I was upfront that was still upset about my birthday and waiting for him to make it up to me. He said a few times that he didn’t realise we were having cake but that is bs because I literally told him right before he disappeared. 

Finally after a couple of weeks I could tell he was getting impatient for sex and typically makes more of an effort to be patient and nice when he wants sex. I know it’s kind of manipulative and of him but I like to reward that good behaviour but I still was hurt about my birthday and indignant that he had made no effort to make it up to me. So I brought it up again at bedtime and he said well actually I was on the lookout for a better espresso machine for you. I have one in mind I just have to track it down etc. or something along those lines. And this is where I might be the a-hole… I bought an espresso machine not long ago. Second hand and it does the job and I like the way it looks in my kitchen. He didn’t really drink coffee before but has become kind of hyper fixated on it lately trying to learn how to optimise the machine and clean it and watching YouTube videos on how to make perfect coffee and researching the best accessories etc. So when he said he was looking for a better machine for my birthday I simultaneously thought “oh that’s nice” but also “my machine is fine, I picked it to suit the aesthetic, he wants a better machine for himself this is nothing to do with my desires or my birthday and he’s just saying this because he wants sex right now “.  Well he must have read my less than enthusiastic reaction because he added ..I didn’t say anything about it because you’d probably say I was getting it for me not you. To which I honestly replied well actually yeah I was thinking that. But then I felt bad for complaining when he evidently was at least thinking of getting me something. On one hand it seems obvious that I’m NTA but also I can’t help but feel he has no clue what to buy me and is anxious of getting the wrong thing so he just avoids it. I can be like that with gift giving too so I get it. But also he could have literally got me flowers and that would have shown he at least cared and then there’s the whole cake incident. So AITA? 

TLDR: husband did nothing for my birthday, I kept bringing it up, eventually he said he was looking for a particular coffee machine for me but I wasn’t impressed because I felt it was more for him than me. Now I feel like TA for not being grateful. However weeks have passed and no new coffee machine has materialised. Maybe because I gently poo pooed the idea or maybe because he just said it to get me to have sex with him?? ",1,1733919399.0,AITAH,11,0.67,False
1hbs5gs,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hbs5gs,Beauty and the Beast,"Mancera as a brand is quite hit-or-miss, they’ve delivered some real gems but also a few underwhelming releases. That said, their recent launches have been consistently bangers.


Cedrat Boise Intense (CBI) was the second niche fragrance I purchased after Arabian Oud Sultani. At first, I regretted buying it as it was a blind buy and didn’t immediately click with me. However, after wearing it multiple times, it grew on me, and now I’m on my second bottle.


CBI is inspired by Creed Aventus but with its own unique twist. It’s about 50-60% similar initially, but then it takes a different path. The opening features black currant with a bright, lemony vibe for the first 20 minutes. After that, woody notes start to emerge, accompanied by a touch of synthetic oud. While it can smell a bit synthetic up close, it’s absolutely magical in the air. On skin, it lasts around 6 hours (my previous bottle lasted around 8 hours, so this seems to be reformulated). The performance can be increased if sprayed on clothes. Overall ratings - 7.5/10 (previously 8.5/10).


Now onto Amore Caffe, one of the best gourmand scents on the market right now, second only to Noir Extreme. I can’t wear it much in Bangalore weather that much though. It’s a linear fragrance, opening with sweet coffee and vanilla and staying that way until it fades, it lasts for around 8 hours. If you love coffee and want to smell like a Caramel Frappuccino, this is the scent for you! It’s perfectly unisex and highly recommended. Overall rating -  9/10.",29,1733919337.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,31,0.94,False

1hbs4yg,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1hbs4yg/i_think_i_might_deserve_better_but_i_still_love/,"I think I might 'deserve better', but I still love him? 21F 22M","Hi all,

I've been dating my boyfriend for 2.5 years now. We are in college, and met here. Our relationship has always been very stable and he is very good with communication. We both come from broken families and made the effort to do better in our relationship than our parents did. We don't ever fight and if we have problems we're good with talking them out. For the most part, I guess, as we haven't figured this issue out.

I (21F) come from a religious family. I myself am not overtly religious but it is ultimately part of my core values and very important to me that my family and their wishes are respected. My boyfriend is atheist and while this is obviously not my ideal, he is more or less respectful when it comes to things involving religion. Actually, this has been the one thing that has come up multiple times through our conversations as something I'd like for him to work on as sometimes he makes disrespectful jokes or makes fun of religious people, things I don't like. Regardless its okay since he doesn't have any real disdain for religious people and its not a source of conflict in our relationship. However, last march, I finally met my boyfriend's family. It was clear immediately that my religion would be a problem, and during dinner, I was grilled with questions about theology and about my faith. First of all, like I said, I am not overtly religious so I couldn't even answer them, and I just felt so judged and scrutinized. I felt like my boyfriend's dad almost wanted to make me question my faith or make me lose it by proving that I was a bad christian. That's how it felt like to me. Whether or not this is true is unknown, but I did mention to my boyfriend that that's how I felt and he just kind of said, ""sorry, that's just how he is"".

Which immediately leads me to my next part. His dad is SO intense. Their relationship confuses me as someone who is deeply close to my family, as theirs is almost purely transactional. My boyfriend and his dad are more like business partners than father and son. They speak MAYBE once a month MAYBE and its just to check if my boyfriend needs anymore money. His dad didn't bother to remember my name until more than 1 year into the relationship, which really bothered me because it made me feel so insignificant. Versus, my mom wanted to know everything about my boyfriend the moment we started dating. My boyfriend says his dad was ""busy"" and didn't have time to know such trivial things, like the girl his son was dating... for context I am the first serious relationship he's ever had and the first person he's ever brought to meet his family. I don't know, I just don't see how you could not care about your own child like that. I'm concerned for our families to meet because I fear that it will cause a nuclear explosion to go off. My family of all women are highly non confrontational and non-argumentative whereas my boyfriend and his dad spend hours debating for fun. ... serious debates, by the way. not silly cute little parent-child debates. I'm concerned that his dad will be even worse to my family than he was to me, and I don't want that for them. We have recovered from MY dad and my mom still has intense anxiety issues from his verbal abuse and the last thing we need in our lives is someone who is going to make us feel like he did.

However, his dad is so absent that part of me feels like it won't be a huge issue. But that is another thing. I have always dreamt of a joint family, and it makes me sad that I won't have that here. We've talked about how our families inevitably won't get along, and my boyfriend is fine with just keeping them apart as much as possible and keeping ourselves in a bubble away from them. This is fine with him because they aren't close, but family is so important to me, and I don't want to keep mine distanced. They also love my boyfriend and have completely accepted him into their lives, so yeah.

We are leaving college soon and I plan to return home to go to grad school. My mom is disabled and while she is independent to an extent, she needs help with finances and paperwork and I am bound to her and have made this very clear to my boyfriend. Of course I can leave home, but I will not leave her to move out of state and that is non-negotiable. I've always dreamt of having a nice, comfortable and peaceful home in the suburbs where I grew up. But my boyfriend hates suburbia and says it bores him. He's understanding of the fact that I can't really move out of state, and so he had planned to live in NY and work for a bit after graduation before eventually starting grad school himself.  I was totally content with this plan because even though we'd be apart, it would only be a 45 minute commute which is totally feasible for weekends if we're both occupied full time. but his dad convinced him to move somewhere else. Probably Boston after graduation. Their family is rich, and he said his dad wants him to make the most of the opportunities available to him. Its like, we had settled on something, and then my boyfriend's dad visited over thanksgiving, and the plan took a 180º turn without me in it. he **ALWAYS** heeds his dad's advice. its like they forgot to consider the fact that traveling to/from boston and spending quality time with your s/o in one weekend is nearly imposssible. I don't want to have it for the rest of my life where my boyfriend's closest confidant blatantly excludes my contribution in his life.

Now for the part about this post. I love him very, very deeply. But I'm concerned about the rest of my life. I want these things with my family and to settle down and be happy. But he never gets me gifts. He doesn't do surprise flowers, or even flowers for that matter. For christmas and birthdays, I get bags of sour patch kids or swedish fish, just random candy from the grocery store. We don't go out on dates, and if we get food, we always split the bill. I tried to be understanding of the fact that he doesn't have a job, but I just found out that HE paid for his dad's stay over thanksgiving break and the cost for hotels and food was over $2000, and he told me he booked a ski trip for himself and a friend over winter break. I don't know, it just hurts I guess. Why wouldn't you want to treat your girlfriend every once in a while?

I love gifting (it is one of my love languages) and I always pick up random things for him as I go along. Maybe a candy bar or a pair of fun socks that I thought he might like or just small and silly things like that. I'm not asking for a rolex or prada purse for my birthday, but I just want to be shown that he put care into picking out a gift for me. I've customized lego figurines of us for valentine's day, hand painted him an espresso cup and platter (he is a total coffee nerd and mentioned he wanted to start collecting them), and spent hours picking out tons of thoughtful gifts that I put thought and care into. I thought maybe I would try getting a less thoughful gift to spend less and put the same amount of effort in that he puts into mine, but it hurts me to be like that since I genuinely love gifting. So what's the right answer? I don't even think he would notice if I stopped putting in the effort with his gifts.

We had our 2 year anniversary in September and I knew he wouldn't do anything for it since he didn't do anything for our first. I wanted to celebrate so I got us tickets for my favorite band in the city. I thought maybe we would go out afterwards or something, but we got chick-fil-a in penn station on the way back to campus. We ordered seperately, and I paid for my own food. He did get me flowers though, which I was grateful for, and in the same sentence he told me that he got a new beer at the store to try, which was like 22 dollars or something. This is relevant because the flowers he got were a 8 dollar bouquet from the grocery store that he picked up while going to get beer. He spent more on beer than he did for our anniversary. And again its really not about the money, its about the fact that these things are so not a priority in any way to him that he would rather get any old flowers than find nice ones for me when he knows I love them. And apparently he did have money this whole time so I don't know why he never gets them for me. His lifestyle is budgeted monthly by his dad since he doesn't work so he gets money for groceries and take out and stuff, and its more than enough to support one person financially. I never understood why he couldn't put aside 5 dollars or something every month to get me something, or even ask his dad for an extra $50 for us. They are quite literally drowning in cash. I can't emphasize enough that this isn't about money-- but I would spend every last penny I had trying to make him happy and he doesn't bother spending a dollar on me. He just is not thoughtful at all, and I am so thoughtful and intentional in everything I do.

We've been dating for 2.5 years and he always says he'll do things but never follows through. I love going to the aquarium (i'm a big marine animal lover), and from before we ever started dating, he's been saying he would take me one day. We've never gone. Last year, I went alone on my birthday because I was tired of waiting and I just wanted to go to the aquarium and I knew he wouldn't plan anything. And I was right, he didn't end up doing anything for my birthday. It was my 21st, by the way. I basically begged him to get me flowers for national girlfriend's day in august while we were long distance, just to have something from him, and he did not. He said he would make it up to me sometime but never did, and I'm sure he never will. There are other things he's said he'll make up, too, that he never has. He never plans anything for us. 2 valentine's days have come and gone where he hasn't done anything. The first year I planned for us to have a nice quiet day and bought us chocolate, strawberries, and cookies to bake together. He watched south park the whole time while I baked. Last year I planned a whole night for us in NYC, and I even made sure to keep costs low by checking literally tens of restaurants and finding a special on entry into some museum. He didn't like the selection of the art at the museum and complained about the restaurant's food. Okay yes it wasn't the best but i spent HOURS combing reddit, tripadvisor, yelp, google reviews, etc to find something in budget and romantic. I called to make reservations, I figured out the subways to take, I bought our train tickets. I got our museum tickets. I did everything. I *always* do everything.  He didn't lift a finger planning the entire date. I'd wished he would, and asked him for help, but he didn't. I just want someone who will appreciate the effort I put into these things, and someone who will make the same effort for me.

I tell him everything about everything because that is just the type of person that I am. But he is very stoic, i guess is the right word, and very introspective. It took me a year to pry him open to get him to tell me about his day. Even still, if I don't ask, then he won't tell. Not that he is being secretive, its just his nature. And it makes me sad because the reason I'm like this is because growing up I always had someone who wanted to hear about every aspect of the day, and he didn't and isn't used to reporting to anyone since his parents were so absent. I just want someone who tells me everything in the same way that I do, but how can I even hold this one against him? We've talked about it but its very evident that it doesn't come naturally to him. Still, it makes me kind of sad when something comes up days later that he did that I would have loved to hear about, that I didn't. I love him, ya know? so I want to delight in all the things he gets up to but I never hear about them.

But I don't want it misconstrued. He is a very loving, patient, and caring man. That's what leaves me so torn. He makes me feel safe and understood and listens to what I have to say. He respects me and cares for me and has made huge changes to himself just for me, most times without me needing to ask. He is so good emotionally and he has no temper, which matters so much to me as someone who grew up with an abusive parent. I really love him but I'm unsure if I want to spend the rest of my life feeling like this. He hasn't done anything wrong, but I just don't know. I hate to say that I ""deserve better"" because I think that he is the most wonderful person, and we get along so well and love each other so so so much, but I don't know. I don't want to think about myself with someone other than him. Its hard to say I want someone who is more like me because I want him to be these things. But I'm afraid that this is just the way he is. I've brought up the gift thing before and that he doesn't plan much but he doesn't see a problem and says that his dad believes that gifts were only for ""big things"" and if I want to plan things than I should. He isn't selfish or uncaring, we just don't see eye to eye. I have a lot of worries about our future but losing someone who loves me and who I love kills me to think about. When I tell him I'm concerned about our future he tells me we will figure out our issues together but I know a life together would be a constant uphill battle. I'm not sure if I want to spend the rest of my life fighting to make things work. He always puts the effort in emotionally, but that's all. Is that enough? Maybe I'm just not valuing what I have. Are my expectations too high to want someone who loves in the same way that I do?

He's been through a lot in his life and he has his own issues. He doesn't really have anyone who truly cares about him besides me, and he wants to marry me. I don't want to leave him and it breaks my heart to think that he would be completely alone without me. I'm not ready to give up yet but I'm so tired of giving my all to get nothing in return. I don't know if I want to spend the rest of my life feeling like this. I'm not sure what advice anyone can give me but maybe someone out there has been in a similar situation. I'm sure you can love someone to pieces and just have them not be right for you.

TLDR: I love my boyfriend deeply, but I’m torn because I feel like I’m always giving more than I’m getting, and I’m unsure if I can handle that for the rest of my life. 21F 22M",1,1733919288.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

* I was just recalling an episode of DS9 where a Romulan diplomat complains about delays to Warbird repairs and Chef O'Brien has to account for it and explain. So, the Chief and his staff are ALSO responsible for repairs of war-damaged ships. Meaning not only does the Chief have the maintenance of a finicky Cardassian-Federation-Bajorn-Frankenstein station, the Defiant, several runabouts, but during wartime: he gets the run a major repair station on the front lines. Imagine if the Romulans didn't get that hospital on the Bajoran moon and Bashir got all the emergency wounded. We'd never see him again on the show.
* On another note, it would have been amusing/great to have a night-shift Chief on DS9 played by someone like William H. Macy who came and went with the frequency of Jett Reno but we only ever saw him with a coffee cup in hand, never a plasma torch or anything useful.

Hi everybody, I want to share about my constipation problems that started in 2020 and ended in 2022 after two years of suffering.  
It all started with a little blood in the toilet after my morning bowel movement ritual.  
I've went to the doctor a few days later to check what is happening and it seemed that I had a fissure and hemorrhoid problems, followed by hemorrhoidal crisis and a lot of pain due to it.

All of this was caused by all the little constipations, that I had earlier.  
The doctor prescribed me with different creams for rectal usage and to make washes with potassium permanganate. These helped just a little bit, but my problems continued because my root constipation problem wasn't solved anyway.

In the next two years I've visited multiple doctors/proctologists, drank all kinds of pills, used all kings of creams and nothing helped. And finally one day after not going to the toilet for 5 days I was finally hospitalized. With pain in the stomach and after drinking multiple laxatives, I became a shit bomb with timer. Although it sounds funny now, it wasn't.

Thanks to the emergency doctor who accepted me that night, and the sanitarian that managed to clean my stomach from all the stuff using enema, I saved myself from a emergent surgery /a few more hours and it could have been needed/.  
For the next one/two months I was mostly fine probably because of the stomach cleaning, but not long after it my problems came back.

6 months later my mom remembered about a homeopath that helped me when I was child having problems with some rashes on my skin.  
I've decided to give it a try since I hadn't anything else to lose. My condition was really bad at that time, I was on different diets, ate only specific breads, foods, etc and have lost almost 20kgs of weight. A dying zombie man.

So I went there, described my whole situation, answered all the questions and started medication with the prescribed homeopathic pills.  
In the next few weeks I've gotten worse /which is normal with homeopathy/ and after a week more a miracle happened.  
I've started going to the toilet regularly everyday, every morning, but the only problem was that some white stuff showed on my tongue.

After doing a laboratory examination it showed that I have E.Coli in my stomach and over-growth of candida both in my stomach and my tongue, which were doing all of this harm to me. /homepathics bring the inner problems outside on a visible place/.  
Probably it was all because of a weak body and immune system due to stress or something else, I cannot know for sure.  
I've started some antibiotics and other medicines for a while, but was not feeling very well from them and stopped in the middle.  
Two years later I have no problems with the constipation. /knocking on wood/.

A little offstory of what happened after that:

A while after fixing my constipation problem I had a case of high BP / high heart rate and did end up in hospital due to drinking a lot of coffees and having a stressful job.  
From time to time my constipation was coming up as a result of the stress, but the doctor who saved me from my pre-infarct condition said to me: ""The only cure for stress is SPORT"".

So, for the last two years I exercise on the street fitness/calisthenics every day /sometimes saturday and sunday as well/, have restored my normal weight \~86kgs, have gained power and muscles, almost have beaten stress and have no constipation issues what so over.

A bit later I've started doing some yoga and breathing techniques and my yoga teacher says: ""For permanent results, permanent actions are needed"".  
If you want to feel good everyday, you have to do something about it everyday.

So my friends,

If you want to get cured, please try another way and don't only go on the road of western medicine.  
Perhaps it helped someone, but it was not me.  
Try homeopathics, herbs, exercices, etc.  
Diets are almost never of your help. Because diet is a temporary thing, and the result of something temporary is also temporary.

It is not that important what you eat, but more important what you put in your heads that stresses you and what you do to convert all your food into proper energy.  
When your body is healthy it converts the food into whatever it is needed for it, even if you eat shit. /still it is better for your to pick a better food when possible/

Ps: I will not mention about pills/homeopathics names because what helped me, can injure you.  
You should ask your local homeopaths/doctors.

And a Big Thanks to my mom, my homeopath and the emergency doctors during these two hell years.

Good luck to you all, I hope my story helps you somehow and you get better sooner, because I know it is a pure hell.",2,1733919213.0,Constipation,1,0.67,False

I am fortunate to work in healthcare 🦷 which gives me a lot of autonomy and flexibility with work hours. I work 2-3 days a week, I’d say I average 5 days a fortnight 8-9 hours a day.

This brings in a total income of around 250k, from this I need to pay super, educational expenses and insurance. 

I’ve had a few people find it odd that given I’m young and able I’m not chasing the grind more. Including my boss who is supportive, but a bit of a workaholic. He is in 60’s still cranking out 5 days a week, but he’s loaded I guess. He has alluded to making “mid 7 figures” and he lives a lavish life but I am not sure if he is happy. My boss is also the owner (I am a contractor)

I just don’t see the point in working more though. I enjoy work sure, it keeps me sharp and it’s social but there are a million things on any given day I’d rather be doing. When I only have 2 days booked in for the week I honestly feel so happy and relaxed. I have no alarm, I slowly get out of bed, go for a run and swim and enjoy a coffee in the sun before reading a book. My expenses are low (40k a year) and I don’t desire expensive things. I find my time and being left to my thoughts to read and wonder more valuable than any watch, car or fancy home.

Is what I am doing wrong and is it something I may come to regret? Would love some outside perspective.",0,1733919150.0,fiaustralia,18,0.31,False
