So yeah I'm 19F in a small Catholic College (I'm ukrainian), was homeschooled and I'm just trying to figure everything out now! I guess since starting college things have been pretty new and different for me and yeah, I'm still super nervous and introverted in general but yeah.

I've had massive baby fever since I was um fourteen ish but um yeah gosh.

I guess I'm trying to figure out or balance the idea of my traditional upbringing and well the idea of other stuff as well and I feel like an older Man would be able to help me out and would be the right fit. My faith is important to me but you can be from any background!

I guess for a long time now I've felt like that I've only been attracted to older Men and I'm not sure exaclty why and I've been sort of wrestling with it but yeah I think it's what I really need. I was raised in the church and it's still important to me and yeah I hope that's okay and we can work around stuff! I was raised with discipline

I have never really been able to be attracted to guys my age and if I crushed on someone it was always someone older and Iguess maybe being homeschooled had to do with it but I feel like maybe I guess now more than ever now that I'm in college that I can take a step and figure out what the right thing for me is. I have hangups and stuff but I want to learn and learn about an older Daddy too and what he would want from me.

I guess I'm trying to figure out or balance the idea of my traditional upbringing and well the idea of other stuff as well and I feel like an older Man would be able to help me out and would be the right fit. What's your fave sort of music? Go to breakfast or do you skip? How do you like your coffee? Could you be a good role model or guide and teacher and my rock for me?

This is a heartfelt (and slightly awkward) request in search of more Midtown friends—specifically around Yonge & Eglinton!

I’ve been to a handful of meets through here, and I’d say they’ve all been pleasantly non-chaotic. Solid wins.

I’d love to do things like hang out and listen to music at Sherwood Park, or check out some of the local restaurants. I currently have a minor foot issue, so I can’t walk too far—basically built for short bursts of activity. I *can* still commute though (with some effort and dramatic sighing).

For the most part, I’ve got all the time in the world. No, really. I’m that mysterious figure sitting on a bench at 2 p.m. on a Tuesday feeding squirrels and contemplating the multiverse. Just kidding, I can't motivate myself to leave my place to go feed some squirrels, so it's worse than we thought folks.

As a professional-level self-isolationist (35M), I have a soft spot for solo-friendly at-home activities: music, art, listening to some albums, or chill listening parties. I enjoy films and TV shows, dislike reality TV (sorry), enjoy LOTR, GoT. I’m 35M, East Asian.

I can be pretty quiet sometimes—like, “Is he okay?” quiet. But I promise I’m just being low volume, not malfunctioning. Feel free to ask me anything! I am shy when it comes to sharing my work so please do not ask me to share, it takes me some time to become comfortable with that.

Also, probably have ADHD or something (Autism or BPD or some combination of something, with the result being a major depressive disorder) =\_= currently mid-quest to figure that one out. on a lot of quests tbh.

And if we’ve already met: hi again! Let’s grab coffee again or play life or take your dog for a walk. Or cya shortly at the meet thing. Or hit up some of that new avengers? or let me meet your twin cats :D

I’ve had to retire from concerts—my ears have waved the white flag. I still love music, just from a more... gently vibrating distance these days.

Some bonus things about me:  
\-recently unemployed, so am taking the entire summer off cause wtf, why not.  
\-I'm writing a novel  
\-If you like Vansire/JORDANN hmu, dope.  
\-I have started the editing phase of a photography project. Okay no I haven't, but if you ask me how it's going I'll probably feel guilty for not starting the editing phase. It's boring okay? But yeah if you bring it up I'll probably start. Otherwise it looks fine to me.

CONS:  
\-addicted to nicotine  
\-smokes things  
\-gets unresponsive when things get awkward  
\-stoned? i mean i think this is a pro. I'm a little more talkative until I am not again.  
\-recently unemployed, budgeting. I mean it's toronto $$$$

Pushing back up to GM3 on MR from like G1 rn, if that rings any bells. If it does—hmu, fellow nerd. Also looking at Doonawakenin or Chronoddisi. If that made sense as well, hmu LOL.

Feel free to dm me on Reddit I find myself using it more often! Have also begun using Discord and IG.

If the post isn't deleted, I haven't been overwhelmed and you should msg me hah.

in before i get self conscious and delete this right now all together.

i'll stop being weird. okay ttys.

Thanks for reading.

I’ll be traveling to London and Edinburgh soon, and while I’m there, I’m hoping to meet some locals.

In the past, I’ve used Couchsurfing both to host travelers in my country and to meet locals when traveling abroad. It was a great way to learn about a place from the people who live there — I made a few good friends and had lots of meaningful experiences this way.

These days, though, especially since the platform became paid and the pandemic changed the way people interact, I feel like it’s much harder to find that sense of community. I still have an account, but it doesn’t give me the same feeling anymore.

I’m really interested in learning about English culture directly from the people who live it. Maybe a local walk, a coffee, or a beer — just something simple and authentic. I know that making new friends in Western Europe can take a little more time compared to my home country, so I’m not expecting anything huge — I’m just open to meeting good people and having some nice conversations.

Do you have any suggestions for how I can connect with locals in England? Or, if you're someone who enjoys meeting travelers and chatting about life, culture, or anything else, feel free to DM me! 🙂",1,1747123163.0,uktravel,0,1.0,False

We have a small coffee shop where I work that has been closed for months. We had to open it up for a few weekends for an event. I'm a manager and I was working in the shop with another person. While working with him I realized the POS card they were using for the POS terminal was not in their name but rather our AGM's name. I asked the person I was working with if he was getting the credit card tips that were being left for him since the credit card tips usually go to the person whose POS card you're using.

I asked him if he was getting the credit card tips in his paycheck. That's when he told me he actually wasn't on the payroll, that my immediate supervisor was paying him $250 cash per weekend to come in and work roughly 3 hours on Friday nights to set up the shop and then about 6-7 hours on Saturday and 6-7 hours on Sunday. 

I know not receiving the credit card tips being left for him is probably some sort of wage theft. And I know paying him under the table like this is probably tax fraud. I'm not a lawyer so I don't know if any other laws are being broken here. One concern I have is if he gets hurt at work what happens then? But more importantly, now that I know about my boss breaking these laws could I face any repercussions legally because I'm a manager and I knew about it and didn't say anything or report it? And do I report it now that I know about it? Does reporting it mean risking my job?

I prefer this greatly over the original Valaya; it really is less sharp and more creamy/cozy but equally as nuclear. It literally projects off the sample card i sprayed it on, which i sprayed once about an hour and a half before writing this. I'm not impressed by PDM but I do like this one. 7/10
* Penhaligon's - Kiss of Bliss: Loved this one when I first smelled it, and still love it. No matcha fragrance I've smelled compares to how accurate it is. Still not sure if I'd actually like wearing it, but I absolutely love the fragrance itself. 8/10
* Penhaligon's - The Favorite: Phenomenal. Violet and iris dream. I have to get a sample or a decant of this because I love purple florals and that bottle is just so beautiful. 8/10
* Penhaligon's - Luna: A revisit! I love the bottle for this one, but I have to be so honest with myself that I’m just not wowed by this. It’s citrusy and dewy and delicate. This would be one of those purchases that would serve solely as a dopamine hit and turn into regret because I don’t love it proportional to what it cost me. It’s pretty, especially to look at, though. 6/10 
* Mind Games - Sissa: Lovely. I was really anticipating smelling this because it’s supposed to be a better balanced, more interesting version of commodity milk, which is too screechy for me. I’m happy to report that it does live up to that expectation; however! It does pull a little masculine for my taste in the time it takes to dry down to that beautiful creamy lactonic scent (like 30 mins) so I will have to play with it. But so far incredible!! 9/10
* Mind Games - Queening: A pretty, crowd pleasing fruity vanilla. Didn’t stick out to me in particular, and therefore i don’t think the price is justified. 5/10
* Mind Games - Prodigy: You know when you can appreciate a scent and think it’s incredible and at the same time know right away that it isn’t for you? That’s how I feel about this. It’s BEAUTIFUL; strong coffee, milk, and rose. It’s quite strong and beautifully blended, but I’m just not the one to wear it and do it justice, and that’s okay. 8/10
* Chanel - Comete: I came back to this hoping I would love it less than I did the first time because of that HEINOUS price tag, but to my displeasure I still love it. Beautifully classy, powdery, and the cherry blossom lingers extra long on my skin. I love the slight aldehydic/metallic touch it has, I think it makes it interesting. UGH! 8/10
* Prada - Infusion d’Iris: LOVE. It is in fact giving baby wipe but in the best way. Ultra clean, super put together. Might test this out as a work-friendly option because I really really like it. 8/10
* Dries Van Noten - Soie Malaquais: just as pretty as the first time I tried it!! No real changes in what I think; it’s quite unique and I intend to buy a decant. 8/10

* Snif x Alex Elle - Gentle Reminder: After my heartbreak with Heal the Way, I was skeptical about this one. But when I saw the notes I HAD to try it. And wow when I tell you this one is rocking my world right now… it makes me feel everything I hoped Heal the Way would. To me the aromatic part of it isn’t as strong, and on my skin the ube and milk tea really come out and stay. It’s calming, warm, and cozy, perfect for fall and staying in. that full bottle is looking beautiful and very tempting to me rn. 9.5/10. ",2,1747122888.0,FemFragLab,0,1.0,False
1klga75,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1klga75/my_bf_only_games_and_smokes_weed_everyday/,My bf only games and smokes weed everyday,"We've known each other for four years, and since 16 he's been a weed addict, and the most intimate and longest relationship he had was with me, especially because he's known me longer than any other woman he has met. and I think he's not used to a real woman because he often dated girls younger than him.
He works, comes home and smokes. Besides he is working out everyday. He already said he will only smoke the test of the weed for this month. So the want for change is there. 

Anyways, after seven months no contact, we met up again last week, he asked me to be his girlfriend and I said yes. He reached out earlier than that, but I was dating another guy then. At home he was gaming while talking with me the whole time. I just think he's afraid of real “in the moment”- type of intimacy. He also told me I should tell him when it bothers me, and the next day I asked if we can watch a movie together he said “it’s not the right time for watching one”, and continued gaming. 

Every evening, he is on a team call with his brother and his friends after work. I mean, I also do participate in that, but I also have goals and stuff that I have to work on so I can't be on the team call every day like them like literally every every day in the evening they are gaming together. And he is smoking around 7-8 joints per day. When he doesn't smoke joints, he smokes cigarettes at work. I don't know if that’s normal weed addiction behaviour, and I wonder how I can help him with that because I don't want to put all my energy into this. He also said that he needs someone by his side (me) for him to be able to stop smoking and it helps him not smoke so many joints. That's what he said.

He's a sweet, sensitive boy in his core, but outwards he wants to be the hood gangster lol. When we cuddle and I take his hand, I can feel that he's not used to this type of intimacy. I can just feel his energy getting shy, although in general he's a lot more affectionate than me.
I know he has ADHD and he even started gaming on his computer while we were watching anime for 20 minutes, after that we continued watching anime, where he always shows huge reactions/intense responses to the plot happening.

His money is also short because usually he spent 400€ on just buying weed for a month. He even said he doesn’t want to spend money on useless coffee if we would go to a nice coffee shop. I just told him i want to do something, since he asked me to come over again. He said we can do what I want. But Idk if I should go over this week, cause I’m afraid he will say that he won’t pay for me. Currently I left him on read since yesterday he didnt reply to me because he “was gaming”. I gave him advice on his chronic tonsilitis, and like it seems he was too proud to go get some medicine yesterday

When I went to see him and pick him up from work last week, he said I didnt wear nice shoes and thats why he wanted to go home straight without going out for dinner. 
At his place when I was hungry and went to the fridge, he said since I’m his girlfriend now “I can also sometimes bring food or buy food if I’m going to eat at his place”. 

If he stops smoking he will have enough money. But the question is if he would share it with me. Maybe my boundaries aren’t good enough. Advice?

I appreciate any advice :)",2,1747122744.0,Advice,6,0.75,False

Many things have happened worldwide in the 29 days since I last posted. Nonetheless, I tried hard to alleviate some of the concerns you shared with me over DM. Apologies if I couldn't revert to you since the numbers were high!

**Disclaimer:** Many of you asked if I am on professional websites such as Unstop, Topmate. **No, I am not. I have zero interest in earning money from helping fellow candidates.** I do it completely out of my own volition and capability. 

In this post, I will be discussing the preparation strategy and, of course, the interviews. 

***Preparation Strategy:*** 

1. Focus on some of the core MBA subjects like Financial Accounting and Reporting, Supply Chain and Operations, and **most importantly, Marketing**. Concepts from such subjects will certainly help you in your case interviews. 

Marketing is by far the most important subject if you want to excel in Case Interviews. Why? Most of the Round 1 interviews ( conducted by Consultants/Managers ) are simple cases ( Revenue Amplification, Cost Optimisation, Profitability ) where marketing concepts are used heavily to create final recommendations. ( Such concepts also help in further rounds).

Finance concepts such as basic accounting ratios, NPV, CAGR, and IRR also do crop up time and again. Finance-focused cases mainly from Mergers & Acquisitions also need **Valuation** concepts, which you may learn in the 2nd year ( if you take Finance specialisation). CA/CS/people with CFA L1/L2 will have a higher probability of being asked Finance-focused cases. For this, knowing how to find the industry PE multiple, how to find the value of the stock/company will come in handy. 

No interview will ask you about Porter's 5 forces, and other strategic management stuff, so yeah, not needed. 

2. Have close friends with whom you'd practise casing, and those who will take out time for you. For me, I had a close friend group of 4 guys who partied together, went out for coffee and Paan at 3 AM (quite popular in Ahmedabad haha), and of course did casing together. They offer blunt feedback and push you to be better, as you would do for them. So yes, having genuine friends was, I would say, the most critical factor. It's ***quid pro quo***, so make use of that. There are a lot of cases to tackle, and you cannot do it alone. Being in a relationship (on campus) also helps in this regard, who can help you in this process.

3. Coming to cases, make use of the **Consulting casebooks** available on LinkedIn/Internet. **IIMA undoubtedly has the best Consulting casebook (India-focused).** You can also make use of the IIM-B and IIM-C casebook. These are enough to have a strong grasp of different case types. They are your best friend during the journey. 

You can also use casebooks of US schools such as Darden, Wharton, and Harvard ( but their casing are more comprehensive and time-consuming). Our cases do not have such a focus on quants/math skills ( cos the recruiters know that you cleared a very, very competitive quants-focused exam). 

4. Networking is vastly important. Your seniors or acquaintances who are in target firms, if you can convince them to take a couple of mock cases, ***it would be the best feedback you can get on your preparation levels.*** 

5. Make use of the college **Consulting club** \- they conduct a lot of speaker sessions from industry stalwarts, college seniors who give some insane resume tips, shortlisting guidance, industry overview, and also conduct Mock PIs ( both cases and culture fit). They will also allocate mentors ( if you are in 1st year) who may help you in the journey ( many don't care ). 

**Bonus Tip: Try to get into the Consulting club as a member/cell-head member.** *Certainly looks good in your resume ( especially if you're a fresher ).*

**6. Read the news. Be knowledgeable about different industries ( outside of the Industry Primer found in Casebooks).** You never know which information would come in handy during an interview. Interviewers look for industry-specific **keywords, and if you manage to throw that during the interview,** no way in hell they will reject you.

  
***Interview Format:*** 

Most firms conduct at least 2 rounds of interviews. Some 3, some 4. The firms will outline their interview process during the Pre-Placement Talk ( only shortlisted candidates are invited to PPT and networking events such as the Partner Dinner).

MBB/some T2 firms additionally have a different format where they allocate a **buddy** ( your college senior in MBB ) who helps you during the preparation phase. Your Buddy Interview will be very important. Though it will be informal, it helps in getting first-hand feedback on your  - 

* **Personal Impact**
* **Entrepreneurial Drive**
* **Inclusive Leadership**
* **Problem-Solving Skills**

Coming to MBB/T2, they usually have 3 rounds of interviews, starting from **(Sr. Con/Manager), (Principal/Engagement Manager/Director), and lastly, (Partner) round.** You have to be at the top of the game at each one of the interviews to make the cut. 

There ***may be*** an additional Personal Experience Interview ( or Hiring Manager round, as is known in Product Management) where they dive deep into your overall profile, work experience, and internship during the Summers. This can also be conducted by the Partner of the said firm. 

**Bonus Tip**: If you make it through to the Partner round ( in essence, clear the first couple of rounds), you are 70% there. Partners look for culture fit, they *normally don't ask about cases, keep it behavioural, and they don't reject that many candidates.* 

*The first round (Manager) is an* ***elimination round*** *and has the highest number of rejections. They look for candidates with good clarity over concepts, and case skills, and also primarily may test for quant skills such as Guesstimates, etc.* 

*The second round is the most important and is mostly a* ***selection round(focus on both casing and overall profile-based questions)****, cos the decision of the Engagement Manager/Principal/Director carries the most weight, and Partners almost never overrule their decision. They will again ask you a case ( often a project they worked upon/are currently working), but it will be much more difficult than the first round, and the interviewers here look for leadership, teamwork and collaboration, as well as solutioning/PS skills.*

*The third round ( Partner ) well, is unpredictable. Mostly, they do not ask for cases, but many a time, they do end up taking cases, as I saw in the last recruitment process. The cases will be unconventional, if any. Remember, they are looking to select you, rather than reject you.*

***Points to note:*** 

1. If you veer in the wrong direction, the interviewers will nudge you in the right direction time and again. You have to pick up the clues. 

2. Body language is a big giveaway. Don't express too much happiness if you nailed a case, do not be distraught if you were terrible. I have seen many, many instances where, in spite of a terrible case interview, a candidate was selected because of the positive attitude, industry knowledge, or just their effortlessly friendly nature. **I used to remind myself in interviews to KEEP SMILING!**

3. For candidates with previous work experience, you must be conversant with your incoming industry, cos more often than not, they ask you a case from that industry itself. It would not look good if you cannot answer questions related to your work experience industry, and may lead to rejection in the first round itself. 

For freshers, interviewers are a bit more complacent, but you may be asked a case from any industry.

  
***Fit Interview:*** 

A **fit interview** in consulting firms —  **Personal Experience Interview (PEI)** at McKinsey or **behavioural interview** at BCG/Bain — assesses whether you’re a cultural and professional fit for the firm. It focuses on your **past experiences, soft skills, and values alignment**, rather than technical or case-solving abilities. They also happen across T2 firms ( but not in B4, AccStrat as far as I know, maybe wrong though). 

My only tip for this is to be yourself. They test your communication, give you situational questions, like what would you do if XYZ happens, and all that. Try to showcase your positive nature and hunger to keep learning, and you'll be good.

As the tile said I'm completely new to Poly, and I'm trying to learn more about it.
This just tomgive context
I'm (33TM) dating someone,.will call them A (31GF) and they are already Poly, they are solopololy (trying to still figure it out what does mean for them) . They already have one partner, not primary partner, date two other person and me (maybe a new one now). 
I always been monogamous, and have only two past relationship one was a marriage, not a good one, that gave me few traumatic experiences, the other one was 6 months but similar to my marriage at the end. 

I don't have huge problems with jealousy, I'm aware that I have problems with abandonment and insecurity(a lot), unfortunately, but I'm never impose anything to anyone, and I was aware what kind of relationship they have. So at the beginning so far so good....
At the beginning I ask them to go slowly as I'm new and I don't want all information as will be too overwhelming. I ask them to wait at least the end of university (I'm studying and work) as I don't have time to have a social life, they know is something that hurts me, and put me in a position where I can't choose to be poly as I don't have time, I have time only for them (doesn't effect them, as they can do whatever they want, I'm just asking them to avoid to talk about their partners during that time)
But I finished university and I want to be more open and start to talk about it, being in a Poly relationship for real and see if it's work for me or not, but with time and step by step, as I don't want to be overwhelmed by this new experience.
My problems kind of start two weeks ago honestly,
We went to an event together, I agree only for them and this was my mistake, I'm have trouble to say no (not in sex). They told me that only few friends where there. I already knew the venue could give me a lot of problems (was a karaoke, high noise, lights, smoke... I'm neurodivergent and my brain don't react well) they took medication (anxiety) and drink for that night and they didn't tell me (I was upset about that). But only when we were in the Uber they told me that one of their dates(B) will be there , I felt like  was in a position where I couldn't say no.... At the end of the story they were trying to help me during that night but at the end I asked them to get out and go back at home, they didn't see that they weren't covered by the corner and I saw them kiss with passion the other guy.
At the end I felt jealousy? No. The problem wasn't the kiss, the problem was that during the week and during that night I took all the negatives side (they didn't kiss me with that passion at all) we argue and seeing the other guy have that kind of treatment .. well it wasn't a good feeling. 

We argue and they play the cards of the victim in my opinion, they felt the pressure because I was new and also the other guy(B) was new to poly, comparing me with B wasn't a good choice (they often bring up other partners to explain their behaviour and this kind of thing piss me off) and I told them that I want a partner not a parent, and being more experienced to poly doesn't mean anything. Relationships don't work like that, even if I'm new to this it doesn't take away my ability and the right to choose for myself...but I ended up asking sorry to them....I don't even know why. 
But from that moment I'm struggling to understand what kind of boundaries I can ask, as I'm feeling they use easily the card ""jealousy is not a failure, you can be jealous"" when I'm trying to express my feelings when I'm hurt.

I don't know if I have the right to ask them boundaries like...
I don't want details about their partners, for now I don't want to know who they are (well yes names, and when , maybe where they have their dates) but a part for that, I want to go slowly. So no details for now, and a few seconds late...they told me that they have a date with this new guy and start to say that he is also Italian (like me) and maybe they have a type (was a light joke) ... I became quiet, maybe a little bit upset, ask them as a joke (I probably was passive aggressive, I admit that) ""so you are dating him because he is Italian?"" But they saw that it wasn't nice for me knowing that kind of details and said ""ok, I'll keep for myself""... I felt bad.

Am I overreacting? I'm trying to ask them to not give me details that are not important, they said that it's just like gossiping (are not private info) but I know that I will compare myself with others right now. Because....

I always give reassurance or validation, it's what I like to give to my partner/partners, and I don't expect to receive the same amount, but I want it. Instead I feel more like being compared (you are new like B, my new date is also Italian) I don't even know why they like me (a part for being good looking, for them)just to give you an idea of the communication. 

Can I ask to not give me details that are not important? For now.
I want to know them, and create a relationship with them, a dynamic with them before bringing others inside(talk about that part of life) develops our own comfort and safety in this dynamic first. Otherwise I can't be comfortable, or secure, and I know that I will be comparing myself with others if I don't feel secure in the  relationship.
Can I ask them to not bring up other partners when I ask something about them? Like...I ask them, what level of disclosure they want, what detail they want (I still don't know) they said that they are comfortable with any level, and told me what kind of disclosure they have with others... And I felt I was kind of the only one(among the other partners )who seemed to be going slow, in a bad way, like a newbie. I didn't ask what they do with others.... But it's not the first time when I ask them what they want in the relationship they bring up what relationship they have with others. 
If someone can explain to me what a solopoly is, I don't think they description matches what they mean ....
Also already know that I want a hierarchy, I'm not afraid to say that, I want it as I need to know what position I have in others life, if I'm not the primary relationship fine but I need to know to organise my emotions and my life. 

Also how did you navigate this early stage? Any tips?

You might find a small box of crackers or something similar on the coffee table. Don't worry, the liner inside gets rolled up tight, and it does make its way back to the kitchen. On days when eating is hard, getting up to get food makes it harder. So there's usually something to graze on nearby.

You'll probably also find a craft project and a pile of books nearby. At least sitting and doing something seems better than just sitting, when I can. Especially if I can't make it to work.

In the kitchen, you'll always find food and water for the pets. They're the one thing that gets taken care of daily. Just because I'm sick doesn't mean my little family should have to go without. Laundry may sit in front of the machines, pantry stuff doesn't always make it over to the pantry, but my wonderful fur babies always have food and water. And daily treats.

In the bathroom, you'll see a large amount of soaps and lotions. That's because the different scents help motivate me to stay clean. Hygiene is something I struggle with, when depressed.

And a crowded life

Surrounded by love of those who’ll share their light

I tell you now

Your heart may skip a beat

Lose youself, sent swept off your feet

Nothing to lose

But a smile to choose

You look unique

You look brand new

This first parts not towards you

You made my hands full

You bore my deepest truths

You sunk your claws

And you hung the noose

I stuttered and trembled

I shuffled and I mumbled

I held my head in shame

I prayed for new ways

You held my hand

You took your last stand

I never stood for a chance

I hold the blame

I carry my shame

I change my ways

We stayed the same

I lied to keep you close

A slave to a life we couldn’t have chose I want to run away, far from this place with a heartfelt, nothing. Wanting. You love this place, times short break. A coffee and a light, cigarettes shared with the nights light. A giggle that could make you cry. Your humour moved me your love consumed me, I lived the moment.

God the way you spoke.

The truth is, you remember it all.

But I forgot I knew you. I could trust you, you were mad. I understand, more than you know the pain you inflict. That was a great birthday gift. You can’t smoke a joint. God can’t we have one good night! But some jew can fuck you in that same hotel room, I’m not anti semetic. It’s all I know about the dude. And the multi vitamins he gave you.

It didn’t feel weird to you. When we’re on a break you couldn’t wait? I was sleeping in the same house different room. Did you forget me then to? though he’s fat and works at fucking Whole Foods. I guess I got a leg up on the dude. I got to know you. The real you,remember how we met. You loved me because I didn’t judge you. I really truly loved you.

Remember that night you hurt your head, I drove for hours drunk and half dead. Calling on the phone, confused and afraid you need to get home today. I guess you must have lied, the doctor said you were fine. The half ass road head didn’t feel the same. I guess that was the best apology I could get. don’t ask anymore questions! My head hurts he was barely even in my room. He saw my tits, but she walked in… looking for him… I got confused and hit my head. They kept giving me drinks… I’m 19 for gods sake. I swear they were serving me doubles. I didn’t even ask! There’s no mark or bruise… mark im not lying to you… your crazy do you know what you do! You watch porn and pay a girl to misuse you! Yeah… talk about that. That’ll distract and he won’t know what to do. I have a card I can always use. So if he presses you, you have this to use.

Hold my hand I’m hurting inside, you have enough money for the mortgage right? I want a new table and btw. I started to crochet. You’re behind in school, you don’t know what to do. I can’t help you it’s too late and I have other things to do.

I’m planning our future! Don’t you see! We need these things! The house the table for six in a home of two. The green coach it looks good mid century. Lightly. LIGHTLY used. but not for the kids to use. you see we can’t have those till we’re 26-maybe 28. I don’t know, I haven’t planned it yet, and it’s all to high stakes. What if we don’t work out. We need to figure that out. Don’t! Blame! Me! I think of all the possibilities.

Did you mean to hurt me? I’m confused I never meant to hurt you. Is it enough? Is it time to let bygones go and move on. Is it too late. To call someone else home? Are you breaking hearts to feel less alone?

# Pro Tips on Styling a White Formal Shirt

A white shirt is incredibly versatile, and here’s how you can style it for different occasions:



# 1. Office Look

* Pair your **white formal shirt** with well-fitted navy or charcoal trousers.
* Add a sleek leather belt and matching formal shoes.
* Opt for a classic tie or keep it open for a smart casual vibe.

# 2. Wedding or Party Look

* Wear it with a tailored **black or dark grey suit** for a sharp, polished appearance.
* A silk pocket square and a stylish watch can add an extra touch of elegance.
* Go for **brown or black leather shoes** depending on your suit color.

# 3. Smart Casual Look

* Roll up the sleeves and pair the shirt with **chinos or well-fitted jeans**.
* A pair of white sneakers or loafers can complete the relaxed yet stylish look.
* Layer it with a blazer or a lightweight cardigan for a refined finish.

# 4. Summer Casual Look

* Wear the shirt with **linen shorts** or cotton trousers.
* Leave the top buttons open for a breezy, laid-back style.
* Slip into loafers or espadrilles for an easygoing vibe.



# Hacks to Keep Your White Shirt Durable for a Long Time

A white shirt requires extra care to maintain its pristine look. 

* **Wash Immediately**: Stains set quickly, so wash your white shirt as soon as possible after wearing it.
* **Use Mild Detergents**: Harsh detergents can weaken the fabric. Stick to gentle, white-safe detergents.
* **Avoid Overwashing**: Too many washes can wear out the fabric. Instead, spot clean whenever possible.
* **Sun Dry with Care**: Drying in direct sunlight can turn your white shirt yellow. Always dry it in a shaded area.
* **Store Properly**: Keep it in a dry place, away from dust and moisture. Use wooden or padded hangers to maintain its shape.
* **Use Baking Soda & Vinegar**: For stubborn stains, make a paste with baking soda and water or soak in vinegar before washing.
* **Iron at the Right Temperature**: Too much heat can damage the fabric. Use medium heat or steam ironing for best results.

# What Should One Never Do with a [**White Shirt?**](https://theindianthreads.com/products/white-solid-linen-formal-men-shirt?_pos=4&_psq=white&_ss=e&_v=1.0&variant=42010181959839)

While a white formal shirt is a fashion essential, there are a few things you should never do if you want to keep it in top condition:

* **Don’t Wear It Without an Undershirt in Hot Weather**: Sweat stains can be hard to remove, so wear an undershirt to absorb moisture.
* **Don’t Use Harsh Bleach Regularly**: While bleach can whiten your shirt, frequent use can weaken the fibers and cause yellowing.
* **Don’t Eat Carelessly While Wearing It**: Avoid messy foods like curry, coffee, or red wine that can leave stubborn stains.
* **Don’t Overload the Washing Machine**: Overcrowding can cause wrinkles and improper cleaning.
* **Don’t Iron Over Stains**: Ironing over a stain will set it permanently, making it harder to remove.
* **Don’t Store Without Cleaning**: Always wash your white shirt before storing it, as sweat and dirt residues can cause discoloration over time.

I love the games where my opponent rolls their eyes and groans ""Ugh... not the London again."" I love the asymmetry. The simplicity. The subtle venom. I love triggering hyper-aggressive Sicilian players by not playing e4. I love the queen side play with c3 or an aggressive c4, the sneaky h4 thrusts, the random a3s. I love castling early. I love castling late. I mostly love not castling at all. I love when they try to punish me for playing it, then blunder by move 12. I love when my opponent castles kingside, and I love delivering them my light squared bishop as a greek gift on h7. I’ve played it against 800s. I’ve played it against masters. I’ve played it blitzkreig on a coffee break. I’ve played it at OTB with trembling hands. I love how it gives me structure. I love how it gives me comfort. I love how it fills my opponent with boredom and me with inevitable victory.

My fiancée (46) recently had her stepmother (79) staying with her for a while after fiancée had surgery. Fiancée caught stepmother smoking crack in her house twice and told her to get out. It turned into a physical altercation in which stepmother pulled a knife on my fiancée and cut her across the face. Fiancée was screaming to her uncle (77) for help and to call 911 the while time this happened. He did fuck all, just watched and when my fiancée finally called the cops her uncle helped stepmother flee the scene. (I wasn't there at the time I was on a video call to my fiancée when all this happened so I saw/heard most of it) 
Fast forward a week and uncle just turns up at fiancées house, starts helping himself to coffee and acting like nothing ever happened. Even had the gall to ask fiancée what happened to her face when he saw the cut across her cheek. Fiancée seems to be fine with this, says things like ""he's old and has nobody else"" ""he cooks dinner for me sometimes"" and I'm really not ok with the situation. He hasn't apologised, hasn't even acknowledged that anything is wrong. Before this happened with her stepmother, fiancée used to bitch and moan that uncle was around too often, using her electricity and drinking all her coffee and creamer. Staying there till 2am, and she's expressed many times that she doesn't feel comfortable having a shower when he's around. 
Fast forward again to Sunday and uncle crashes his car (someone crashed into him but the cars a write off) and fiancée tells me she's got to let uncle borrow the car. 
Excuse me? No you don't. You need that car. She has hospital appointments etc to get to. She spent hours on the phone to me yesterday crying because she couldn't go to her recently passed away friends celebration of life, because uncle had her car! 
But the more I bring up that she needs to take her car back and tell uncle to get the hell out of her life the more she acts like I'm being unreasonable.

I work remote so no need to factor in commute— although I travel a lot so ideally not too far from airports. 

I think I prefer a little slower paced environment (not completely surrounded by noise & traffic) and with walkable access to coffee/restaurants/gym/possibly nature— but not too geriatric as I’m single and want to meet people. 

I’ve completed ruled out DTLA, Hollywood, SM, Venice for example as that life does not appeal to me. Some friends have mentioned I may like Glendale, Atwater Village, Los Feliz, and Burbank. I plan to drive around to see what it’s like.

I tried to tell some people some years ago. They thought I was crazy, also that was the time when a lot of people were faking this i guess. I shut up about it and got different friends. 

Okay but now im married. My husband asked me if I have OSDD. So like I didn't know what to say. So I told him the truth. I guess idk he figured it out. 

He watched this video I guess, of this older woman who had it. She was describing the symptoms and her alters, her wife was there. Her wife talked about their marriage and what it was like being married to multiple people. Or someone with multiples I guess???

That night we had a fight. We dont have a great relationship rn. Its chill, we're working itnout. Its not me tho. Ive been in therapy for years and he just agreed to go and be honest with his therapist and also find a new one cause he might be autistic like his son. Hes a dick bag sometimes. A lot actually. And that's the issue. Not to get too deep into it.

Im not an angel tho, but yeah hes not the best partner of dad a lot of the time. His mom and I think he can change. Sorry for typos and grammar its late and I have my baby in my arms. Trying not to disturb her 

Anyway we worked it out and he went to sleep and I stayed up next to him and argued with myself I guess. And then i felt different and told him. I mean I told but not really. 

The next morning I woke up and felt the same as before the argument with myself. He noticed I guess. After that video he said something clicked and he asked me on our coffee run. 

Idk what to do. 

He said I should tell my therapist. I don't know. Hes the only person who's seen it or recognized it, and like, not thought I was crazy. Maybe that's cause we live together? I do change a lot. Like styles, hair, makeup, beliefs, life courses. I mean I have so many things happening at once. We're all pretty functional when medicated for our adhd i think

Should I get therapy? Should I open up fully to my husband? Like he just asked if some were guys. I said yes. He asked if he could know their names. I said no. I mean I dont even know all of their names? Is that common? ",2,1747121352.0,OSDD,0,1.0,False

1klfxbm,https://www.reddit.com/r/lawofassumption/comments/1klfxbm/manifestation_101_the_nobullshit_guide/,MANIFESTATION 101: The No-Bullshit Guide,"Dear Lads and Ladettes,

Put your spiritual seatbelt on, because today, we're diving facefirst into a topic that TikTok, tarot girls, and half-baked “gurus” have all managed to overcomplicate:

**MANIFESTING.**

Yep. That thing you’ve probably seen slapped on a vision board next to a Lambo, a six-pack, and someone’s ex.  
But this time, you’re going to **understand it properly.** No sugar. No fluff. No BS.  
You’ll walk out of this post like a damn wizard, knowing how to bend reality like it owes you money.

**What the Hell Is Manifesting really?**

Manifesting isn’t lighting a lavender candle at 11:11 while whispering to Saturn.  
It's not peeing into the moon water and bathing with it.  
It’s not begging the Universe like a broke simp for what you want.  
And it’s definitely not about being a “high-vibe glow angel” 24/7.

**Manifesting = Thinking from the END**

Not *“thinking about what you want”,* Not *“sending signals to the cosmos”*  
Just thinking **as if** you already have the damn thing.

That's it. No incense required.

You want love? Cool. Assume you’re loved.

You want money? Sexy. Assume you're already wealthy.

You want that glow-up, six-pack, hot partner, free coffee? Assume it’s a done deal.

Manifesting is basically what I'd call, a mental cosplay.  
You’re playing the role of the version of you who’s already living the dream.  
Difference is; you’re taking it dead serious.  
Think it. Feel it. Live it. Until the outside world’s like, “Oh sh\*t, guess we better match this vibe.”

“But, won’t I feel like I’m lying to myself?”

Babe, yes.  
You **are** lying to yourself; **on purpose.**  
Manifesting is a deliberate delusion, but like, in a **sexy, rebellious, reality-bending way**.

You’re flipping off “proof” and saying“, Nah, I’ll believe first, then reality can catch TF up.”

Why?  
Because life’s a mirror, not your master.  
You don’t wait to feel rich till you’re rich.  
You **feel rich first**, and suddenly life starts throwing discounts, opportunities, and money like it's drunk at a strip club.

""But What If I’m Obsessed? Needy? Down Bad?”

You’re human. Welcome to the club. Wanting isn’t the problem. Needing isn’t even the problem.  
**Thinking that you don’t have it is the problem.**

Wanna think about it 24/7? Great.  
Wanna affirm “It’s done” like a maniac? Excellent.  
Wanna daydream while brushing your teeth? Go nuts, baby.

It’s only a bad thing if your inner monologue starts sounding like:  
“Why isn’t it here yet?”, ""Am I doing it wrong?”, “The Universe probably blocked me”  
Don’t be that shallow, my guy/ girl.

If you’re gonna be obsessed, be obsessed like it’s **already yours**, not like you’re chasing crumbs from the divine table.

“But What If I Doubt? Cry? Spiral?”

You will. And it’s okay. You’re not a glitch in the manifesting matrix.

You don’t need: High vibes 24/7, Angel numbers tattooed on your forehead, A healed inner child from 1602 BC, Your chakras doing synchronized swimming

You just need to **get back on track**. That’s it.

Doubt doesn’t ruin anything, unless you *assume* it does.  
Have your breakdown, eat your sad snack, yell into a pillow.  
Then snap out of it and go, “It’s still mine. I’m still hot. I’m still that mf.”

The Only Rule You Ever Need: Think FROM the state of already having it -> Persist -> Materialization

Everything else? Optional fluff. Play with it if it helps. Drop it if it doesn't.

You don’t need to: Visualize like a Pixar animator, Moonbathe topless on a mountain, Let go of anything (unless it’s toxic exes or bad WiFi), Align your frequency like you’re an FM radio.

Just assume it’s done. Again. And again. And again.  
Until you don’t have to fake it anymore, because life finally caught up.

For my Short Attention Span Homies & ADHD peeps:

\- Manifesting = Thinking as the version of you who already has it

\- Obsession? Fine. Want? Fine. Just don’t contradict it.

\- Doubts? Normal. Don’t overthink it. Just correct and carry on.

\- You can’t mess this up unless you decide you did.

\- Make it casual. Make it sexy. Make it yours.

Say it in your head. Or whisper it like a villain. Or scream it like you’re the main character in a Netflix drama.

Just keep assuming you're already that version of you.  
Eventually, reality’s gonna tap out and go, “Fine. You win. Here’s everything.”

If you've made it till here, Congratulations.

This routine has around a 17% success rate of not making me late (:

I pretty consistently manage to sleep through the alarms, or get stuck in bed (writing this post f. ex), or delay and then get stuck in the shower, or decide to try and find a better place for the living room lamp, or legit anything.

I'm posting here out of concern for someone I knew from university. We met in 2019 in the UK — not super close, but we stayed in touch a bit. He recently reached out to me completely out of the blue, and what he told me was honestly heartbreaking.

He lives in Squamish now and has been going through an extremely traumatic time. He recently went through a divorce and has two young kids. He also spent some time in jail for violating a no-contact order — apparently he tried to speak to his ex and their children at church, which broke the terms. On top of that, both of his parents recently passed away, and he was unable to attend their funerals as they were held in India. He’s South Indian, and this cultural and physical distance seems to have added another layer of pain and isolation to everything he’s been dealing with.

Now he’s saying he’s started seeing visions of his deceased parents and lots of other surprising things — which sounds like it could be a sign of extreme stress, grief, or possibly a mental health crisis. He told me he feels completely alone, like no one believes him or is willing to help.

What really struck me is that he reached out to *me* — someone he hasn't spoken to in years, and who lives on the other side of the world. I'm currently in Europe and can’t help as much as I could. The fact that he contacted someone so far away makes it clear how isolated and desperate he must be feeling.

From what I remember, he’s a good guy — thoughtful, kind, and soft-spoken and he’s someone who takes his faith in God seriously and has always found strength in it. He just seems completely overwhelmed and alone right now. I know there can be stigma sometimes, especially when someone is from a different background — he’s South Indian, and I worry that might add to why he’s being overlooked or misunderstood.

If anyone in the Squamish area knows of mental health resources, support groups, or even is open to grabbing a coffee with someone who just needs a compassionate ear, please reach out. He needs professional support, but also some basic human kindness.

Feel free to DM me if you have any ideas or are willing to help. I’d really appreciate it.

For context, this was in the waiting room at the doctor's. This guy wasn't even a patient but was sat with his friend who had a cast on his leg. They both treated the waiting room as their own living room with used tissues on the coffee table, shoes taken off (he was walking around the surgery in socks and demanding to be seen, although it seemed like there was a backlog of patients that afternoon so none of us were going anywhere). 

As his phone volume got increasingly louder with the misogyntic shorts, I asked him if he had headphones. He pretended to not understand English, so I asked his friend if he did so he could translate. Then he asked me if I was selling some 😂 he then grabbed his stuff and stormed out of the waiting room but not before going on a whole rant in Arabic, interspersed with ""fucking bitch"" thrown my way. I suppose when your English tutor is Andrew Tate that will probably be one of your go-to phrases.

The administrative staff later told me that he's been asked not to come back, so there's the silver lining at least.

*April 23, 2025*

My friend was over visiting, I offered tea. She said yes.

She's not much of a tea drinker - she normally drinks cheap herbal teas (which are not Actually Tea anyway), and isn't picky. I, on the other hand, have a cabinet full of teas of various types, imported from around the world.

I offered her a decent selection: a nice oolong, a nice white tea, a high-quality herbal, a good flavored black. She pointed at something else in the cabinet and went ""what about that one?""

I hesitated, then said it's pretty expensive pu-erh I had imported, and she probably wouldn't like it anyway. She said I'm being stingy and could let her taste for herself.

But pu-erh is a polarizing tea anyway, and this stuff is not cheap at all, and it would be difficult for me to get more of this brand. I know I can make multiple cups from it, but I hadn't been planning on doing a pu-erh week right now, and really didn't want to ""waste"" it on someone who probably wouldn't like it anyway. She doesn't even like strong black tea!

(for those not in the know: my family has compared the smell of pu-erh to ""fish"" and ""dirty socks"". I like it a lot, but I understand it's not everybody's thing.)

Now she's being passive aggressive at me. AITA?

NTA. Your mate was out of line. You offered her decent tea, she went poking about and asked for your good stuff like it was hers. That pu-erh’s not builder's brew – it’s niche, expensive, and an acquired taste. If she’s not even into proper tea and normally drinks glorified potpourri, what’s she on about?

If she normally drinks floral bathwater, she’d likely hate the pu-erh anyway. Let her sulk, she’s being daft. [ruyrybeyro](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k601iv/aita_for_not_sharing_the_good_tea_with_a_friend/mom1ml5/)

I'm not understanding why its so taboo to say ""that's really expensive and I don't want to share it""? These are hard times and if I buy something pricey for myself I want to

A. Share it with only my wife or

B. Share it with nobody

If someone said ""that was expensive I'm saving it and it's stinky so you won't enjoy it anyway"" to me? Instantly dropped. Totally makes sense. NTA. [halfpepper](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k601iv/aita_for_not_sharing_the_good_tea_with_a_friend/momauww/)

I said very apologetically that it's really difficult to get, admittedly mentioning that it's expensive was a mistake, and that pu-erh is a very polarizing tea and lots of people don't like it (and included the anecdote about my family and the fish comments).

I clearly wasn't the most tactful, hence coming here, but I wasn't actually trying to be a massive jerk about it.

- 

I have nothing against her drinking cheap tea. The ""isn't really tea anyway"" is about herbal teas, which... are literally not tea, and no tea-drinker I knows will refer to them as ""actual"" tea. I didn't say that to her, anyway. Please note the Humorous Capitalization used there.

My point is that it's a very different flavor for someone who generally drinks herbals.

Smelling would have been no use. It doesn't have a strong smell, and nothing prepares you for the pitch black that results.

Taking this all the way to ""is she really a friend"" over a minor conflict about tea is a bit much, imo.

- 

fwiw this isn't a huge strop, she was just annoyed. It's not the highest-stakes conflict I've ever been involved in, I just felt a bit bad afterwards.

- 

I think she was just kinda nosing at my interesting-looking tea cabinet. Which I get, but when I visit my fellow tea-drinking friends, even if I see something shiny I'll generally keep my eyes to myself unless it's offered... tea can be very expensive.

If it had been a different tea I might've given her anyway, but I just couldn't bring myself with the pu-erh.

- 

The tea was in the cabinet. I opened it and took out several options to offer her (including an herbal). She looked in the cabinet while I was doing so and asked about the pu-erh.

I hadn't thought to pre-remove the tea from the cabinet so she wouldn't see that there's other tea, because most people will choose from provided options.

- 

It's kind of the opposite of ""appreciate this fine brew"", though? Yes it's expensive, but I have yet to meet anybody around me who actually likes pu-erh, because it's so smelly. Even my lapsang souchong drinking husband doesn't like it.

It's not a snobbery thing, it's really that many people* just don't like it, even among tea snobs.

I know it wasn't smart to mention the price, which redirected the whole issue.

*eta: many people I know don't like it. I am aware that it has plenty of afficionados

- 

She was passive aggressive for a bit, then we kept hanging out and parted cordially. I just felt bad afterwards and decided to post, since I figured AITA could use a change from crazy fiancees, inheritance entitlement, and childfree weddings.

- 

She wasn't actually aware of my large tea collection, and in the end she chose the herbal most similar to what she drinks at home (though some of the other ones I offered her were unfamiliar-to-her teas, like oolong, and good quality). So I don't think she was in the most adventurous mood.

Incidentally, she was kind of briefly snitty and moved on, this isn't a massive fight. I just felt bad afterwards.

- 

Mentioning the cost was definitely a stupid moment for me. Though in fairness, I have another friend who's a big tea-drinker and if she said some tea was super rare/super expensive, I'd be like yeah no, enjoy that! I can fund my own expensive hobby lol

Still, not my finest hour

- 

Regarding herbals, I do have some, even some nice ones, and I did offer her! She's just one of those people who goes ""what's the difference"" lol

- 

I have also definitely had friends who ask for tea, brew a cup, and then drink three sips and the rest gets poured out. Sob.

And the tea I offered her was good! Absolutely not trash tea.

In my friend's defense, though, while she was a bit snitty, she didn't throw a whole tantrum or anything, and we parted cordially. I just felt bad afterwards, which was why I posted

- 

If I was making pu-erh I would have absolutely offered her a taste! I also didn't drink anything outside of the selection I'd taken out, I wasn't going to drink something I hadn't offered.

- 

This pu-erh is wayyyy above my normal price range, because while I may have a bit of a tea problem, my wallet is not fat enough to really indulge. I'd received it as a gift from someone who had it gifted to them and was like ""I don't like tea anyway, d'you want it"". It was like gold from heaven.

- 

I didn't tell her she drinks cheap herbals. I told you guys - because she does. She buys the cheapest supermarket stuff. I even buy the more expensive herbals, the ones with big fat sachets full of whole leaves and flowers and such.

It was just to explain her general taste in tea/herbal. I'm fine with her enjoying what she enjoys.

- 

I don't think it's talking down to her. She will also say she buys the inexpensive tea, because it tastes fine to her. It's a description of her actual herbal-tea-shopping habits. I have some things where I'll buy the cheap option, because I don't care or can't tell the difference myself (like coffee. I tell my friends not to waste their good coffee on me, since I don't particularly like it anyway and will just dump sugar in it).

It's a factual description of the type of herbal tea she buys. She's a lovely person, which has no bearing on her choice of hot beverages.

*May 12, 2025, 19 days later*

So I was judged NTA on the post, but there was definitely a lot of very... lively discussion about tea, tea snobs, and inappropriate nosing in cabinets. I very much appreciated all the comments.

As it happened, about a week after the post, our friend-group whatsapp started talking about...you guessed it...tea. Specifically, somebody went ""what do you mean 'different types of tea', like verbena?"", and another friend, not even me, went off about how that's not real tea (look, my friends and I agree on the important things in life) (also I'm waiting for people to wonder why tf we keep on talking about tea on our whatsapp group. it doesn't actually happen that often, I swear).

Anyway I jumped in and said HOW ABOUT WE HAVE A TEA PARTY and I will let y'all try the fancy stuff.

So we did! About ten friends came, including the original friend who was cruelly denied the Good Pu-erh.

We tried 8 different types of tea, including some variants of the same type, so they could compare the flavors (e.g. two oolongs, two English Breakfasts). The biggest hit was the chai, lol. Afterwards some people asked where they could order some of the teas for themselves.

And as for the friend from the first post, she tried the coveted pu-erh aaaaaaaand.... did not like it lol. Otoh, her heart opened to the genmaicha. One of my other friends did enjoy the pu-erh, though.

Everyone had a good time, and agreed that we should totally do it again. I am now sitting here and sipping my third steep of the leaves with great satisfaction.

It was a really positive ending to the whole thing! It was also really fun hearing my friends comparing the tea flavors to each other and commenting on them.

People also brought finger foods and cookies and stuff, to make it a proper party :)

- 

Interestingly, most of my crowd liked the ""regular"" green better than the genmaicha, and my cheaper oolong better than the expensive. I think some of it is that since most of them are used to less expensive teas, if the flavor isn't punching them in the face they don't feel it as much?

Got a favorite oolong to recommend?

- 

well, we'll forever be on different sides of the divide regarding how obnoxious it is to call not-tea ""tea"". You know what a bummer it is to get to someone's house, be offered tea after dinner, and it's a tisane? .... I mean maybe you don't lol. And then I have to drink it, otherwise I'll look like an asshole.

A little gusty out there today, wasn't it, comrades?  
Yeah. Gusty.  
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow.  
Six miles, huh?  
Barry!  
A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.  
Maybe I am.  
You are not!  
We're going 0900 at J-Gate.  
What do you think, buzzy-boy?  
Are you bee enough?  
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.  
Hey, Honex!  
Dad, you surprised me.  
You decide what you're interested in?  
Well, there's a lot of choices.  
But you only get one.  
Do you ever get bored doing the same job every day?  
Son, let me tell you about stirring.  
You grab that stick, and you just move it around, and you stir it around.  
You get yourself into a rhythm.  
It's a beautiful thing.  
You know, Dad, the more I think about it,  
maybe the honey field just isn't right for me.  
You were thinking of what, making balloon animals?  
That's a bad job for a guy with a stinger.  
Janet, your son's not sure he wants to go into honey!  
Barry, you are so funny sometimes.  
I'm not trying to be funny.  
You're not funny! You're going into honey. Our son, the stirrer!  
You're gonna be a stirrer?  
No one's listening to me!  
Wait till you see the sticks I have.  
I could say anything right now.  
I'm gonna get an ant tattoo!  
Let's open some honey and celebrate!  
Maybe I'll pierce my thorax. Shave my antennae. Shack up with a grasshopper. Get a gold tooth and call everybody ""dawg""!  
I'm so proud.  
We're starting work today!  
Today's the day.  
Come on! All the good jobs will be gone.  
Yeah, right.  
Pollen counting, stunt bee, pouring, stirrer, front desk, hair removal...  
Is it still available?  
Hang on. Two left!  
One of them's yours! Congratulations!  
Step to the side.  
What'd you get?  
Picking crud out. Stellar!  
Wow!  
Couple of newbies?  
Yes, sir! Our first day! We are ready!  
Make your choice.  
You want to go first?  
No, you go.  
Oh, my. What's available?  
Restroom attendant's open, not for the reason you think.  
Any chance of getting the Krelman?  
Sure, you're on.  
I'm sorry, the Krelman just closed out.  
Wax monkey's always open.  
The Krelman opened up again.  
What happened?  
A bee died. Makes an opening. See? He's dead. Another dead one.  
Deady. Deadified. Two more dead.  
Dead from the neck up. Dead from the neck down. That's life!  
Oh, this is so hard!  
Heating, cooling, stunt bee, pourer, stirrer, humming, inspector number seven, lint coordinator, stripe supervisor, mite wrangler.  
Barry, what do you think I should... Barry?  
Barry!  
All right, we've got the sunflower patch in quadrant nine...  
What happened to you?  
Where are you?  
I'm going out.  
Out? Out where?  
Out there.  
Oh, no!  
I have to, before I go to work for the rest of my life.  
You're gonna die! You're crazy! Hello?  
Another call coming in.  
If anyone's feeling brave, there's a Korean deli on 83rd that gets their roses today.  
Hey, guys.  
Look at that.  
Isn't that the kid we saw yesterday?  
Hold it, son, flight deck's restricted.  
It's OK, Lou. We're gonna take him up.  
Really? Feeling lucky, are you?  
Sign here, here. Just initial that.  
Thank you.  
OK.  
You got a rain advisory today, and as you all know, bees cannot fly in rain.  
So be careful. As always, watch your brooms, hockey sticks, dogs, birds, bears and bats.  
Also, I got a couple of reports of root beer being poured on us.  
Murphy's in a home because of it, babbling like a cicada!  
That's awful.  
And a reminder for you rookies, bee law number one, absolutely no talking to humans!  
 All right, launch positions!  
Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz! Buzz, buzz, buzz, buzz!  
Black and yellow!  
Hello!  
You ready for this, hot shot?  
Yeah. Yeah, bring it on.  
Wind, check.  
Antennae, check.  
Nectar pack, check.  
Wings, check.  
Stinger, check.  
Scared out of my shorts, check.  
OK, ladies,  
let's move it out!  
Pound those petunias, you striped stem-suckers!  
All of you, drain those flowers!  
Wow! I'm out!  
I can't believe I'm out!  
So blue.  
I feel so fast and free!  
Box kite!  
Wow!  
Flowers!  
This is Blue Leader, We have roses visual.  
Bring it around 30 degrees and hold.  
Roses!  
30 degrees, roger. Bringing it around.  
Stand to the side, kid.  
It's got a bit of a kick.  
That is one nectar collector!  
Ever see pollination up close?  
No, sir.  
I pick up some pollen here, sprinkle it over here. Maybe a dash over there, a pinch on that one.  
See that? It's a little bit of magic.  
That's amazing. Why do we do that?  
That's pollen power. More pollen, more flowers, more nectar, more honey for us.  
Cool.  
I'm picking up a lot of bright yellow, Could be daisies, Don't we need those?  
Copy that visual.  
Wait. One of these flowers seems to be on the move.  
Say again? You're reporting a moving flower?  
Affirmative.  
That was on the line!  
This is the coolest. What is it?  
I don't know, but I'm loving this color.  
It smells good.  
Not like a flower, but I like it.  
Yeah, fuzzy.  
Chemical-y.  
Careful, guys. It's a little grabby.  
My sweet lord of bees!  
Candy-brain, get off there!  
Problem!  
Guys!  
This could be bad.  
Affirmative.  
Very close.  
Gonna hurt.  
Mama's little boy.  
You are way out of position, rookie!  
Coming in at you like a missile!  
Help me!  
I don't think these are flowers.  
Should we tell him?  
I think he knows.  
What is this?!  
Match point!  
You can start packing up, honey, because you're about to eat it!  
Yowser!  
Gross.  
There's a bee in the car!  
Do something!  
I'm driving!  
Hi, bee.  
He's back here!  
He's going to sting me!  
Nobody move. If you don't move, he won't sting you. Freeze!  
He blinked!  
Spray him, Granny!  
What are you doing?!  
Wow... the tension level out here is unbelievable.  
I gotta get home.  
Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain. Can't fly in rain.  
Mayday! Mayday! Bee going down!  
Ken, could you close the window please?  
Ken, could you close the window please?  
Check out my new resume. I made it into a fold-out brochure. You see? Folds out.  
Oh, no. More humans. I don't need this.  
What was that?  
Maybe this time. This time. This time. This time! This time! This... Drapes!  
That is diabolical.  
It's fantastic. It's got all my special skills, even my top-ten favorite movies.  
What's number one? Star Wars?  
Nah, I don't go for that... kind of stuff.  
No wonder we shouldn't talk to them. They're out of their minds.  
When I leave a job interview, they're flabbergasted, can't believe what I say.  
There's the sun. Maybe that's a way out.  
I don't remember the sun having a big 75 on it.  
I predicted global warming. I could feel it getting hotter. At first I thought it was just me.  
Wait! Stop! Bee!  
Stand back. These are winter boots.  
Wait!  
Don't kill him!  
You know I'm allergic to them! This thing could kill me!  
Why does his life have less value than yours?  
Why does his life have any less value than mine? Is that your statement?  
I'm just saying all life has value. You don't know what he's capable of feeling.  
My brochure!  
There you go, little guy.  
I'm not scared of him.It's an allergic thing.  
 Put that on your resume brochure.  
My whole face could puff up.  
Make it one of your special skills.  
Knocking someone out is also a special skill.  
Right. Bye, Vanessa. Thanks.  
Vanessa, next week? Yogurt night?  
Sure, Ken. You know, whatever.  
You could put carob chips on there.  
Bye.  
Supposed to be less calories.  
Bye.  
I gotta say something. She saved my life. I gotta say something.  
All right, here it goes.  
Nah.  
What would I say?  
I could really get in trouble. It's a bee law. You're not supposed to talk to a human.  
I can't believe I'm doing this. I've got to.  
Oh, I can't do it. Come on!  
No. Yes. No. Do it. I can't.  
How should I start it? ""You like jazz?"" No, that's no good.  
Here she comes! Speak, you fool!  
Hi!  
I'm sorry. You're talking.  
Yes, I know.  
You're talking!  
I'm so sorry.  
No, it's OK. It's fine.  
I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed.  
Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting.  
This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee!  
I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me.  
And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised.  
That was a little weird. I'm talking with a bee.  
Yeah.  
I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me!  
I just want to say I'm grateful.  
I'll leave now.  
Wait! How did you learn to do that?  
What?  
The talking thing.  
Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up.  
That's very funny.  
Yeah.  
Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with.  
Anyway... Can I... get you something?  
Like what?  
I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Coffee?  
I don't want to put you out.  
It's no trouble. It takes two minutes.  
It's just coffee.  
I hate to impose.  
Don't be ridiculous!  
Actually, I would love a cup.  
Hey, you want rum cake?  
I shouldn't.  
Have some.  
No, I can't.  
Come on!  
I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms.  
Where?  
These stripes don't help.  
You look great!  
I don't know if you know anything about fashion.  
Are you all right?  
No.  
He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison.  
He finally gets there.  
He runs up the steps into the church.  
The wedding is on.  
And he says, ""Watermelon?  
I thought you said Guatemalan.  
Why would I marry a watermelon?""  
Is that a bee joke?  
That's the kind of stuff we do.  
Yeah, different.  
So, what are you gonna do, Barry?  
About work? I don't know.  
I want to do my part for The Hive, but I can't do it the way they want.  
I know how you feel.  
You do?  
Sure.  
My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist.  
Really?  
My only interest is flowers.  
Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan.  
Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it?  
You're in Sheep Meadow!  
Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond!  
No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once.  
Why do girls put rings on their toes?  
Why not?  
It's like putting a hat on your knee.  
Maybe I'll try that.  
You all right, ma'am?  
Oh, yeah. Fine.  
Just having two cups of coffee!  
Anyway, this has been great.  
Thanks for the coffee.  
Yeah, it's no trouble.  
Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life.  
Are you...?  
Can I take a piece of this with me?  
Sure! Here, have a crumb.  
Thanks!  
Yeah.  
All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not.  
OK, Barry.  
And thank you so much again... for before.  
Oh, that? That was nothing.  
Well, not nothing, but... Anyway...  
This can't possibly work.  
He's all set to go.  
We may as well try it.  
OK, Dave, pull the chute.  
Sounds amazing.  
It was amazing!  
It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life.  
Humans! I can't believe you were with humans!  
Giant, scary humans!  
What were they like?  
Huge and crazy. They talk crazy.  
They eat crazy giant things.  
They drive crazy.  
Do they try and kill you, like on TV?  
Some of them. But some of them don't.  
How'd you get back?  
Poodle.  
You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see.  
You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal.  
Well...  
Well?  
Well, I met someone.  
You did? Was she Bee-ish?  
A wasp?! Your parents will kill you!  
No, no, no, not a wasp.  
Spider?  
I'm not attracted to spiders.  
I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face.  
So who is she?  
She's... human.  
No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law.  
Her name's Vanessa.  
Oh, boy.  
She's so nice. And she's a florist!  
Oh, no! You're dating a human florist!  
We're not dating.  
You're flying outside The Hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite!  
She saved my life! And she understands me.  
This is over!  
Eat this.  
This is not over! What was that?  
They call it a crumb.  
It was so stingin' stripey!  
And that's not what they eat.  
That's what falls off what they eat!  
You know what a Cinnabon is?  
No.  
It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up...  
Sit down!  
...really hot!  
Listen to me!  
We are not them! We're us.  
There's us and there's them!  
Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning?  
There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me!  
You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee!  
Thinking bee.  
Thinking bee.  
Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee!  
There he is. He's in the pool.  
You know what your problem is, Barry?  
I gotta start thinking bee?  
How much longer will this go on?  
It's been three days! Why aren't you working?  
I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about.  
What life? You have no life!  
You have no job. You're barely a bee!  
Would it kill you to make a little honey?  
Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you.  
Martin, would you talk to him?  
Barry, I'm talking to you!  
You coming?  
Got everything?  
All set!  
Go ahead. I'll catch up.  
Don't be too long.  
Watch this!  
Vanessa!  
We're still here.  
I told you not to yell at him.  
He doesn't respond to yelling!  
Then why yell at me?  
Because you don't listen!  
I'm not listening to this.  
Sorry, I've gotta go.  
Where are you going?  
I'm meeting a friend.  
A girl? Is this why you can't decide?  
Bye.  
I just hope she's Bee-ish.  
They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena?  
To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream!  
Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering.  
A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events?  
No. All right, I've got one.  
How come you don't fly everywhere?  
It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster.  
Yeah, OK, I see, I see.  
All right, your turn.  
TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane!  
You don't have that?  
We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease.  
Oh, my.  
Dumb bees!  
You must want to sting all those jerks.  
We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us.  
So you have to watch your temper.  
Very carefully.  
You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust.  
Oh, my goodness! Are you OK?  
Yeah.  
What is wrong with you?!  
It's a bug.  
He's not bothering anybody.  
Get out of here, you creep!  
What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular?  
Yeah, it was. How did you know?  
It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit.  
You've really got that down to a science.  
I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue.  
I'll bet.  
What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this?  
How did this get here? cute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select?  
Is he that actor?  
I never heard of him.  
Why is this here?  
For people. We eat it.  
You don't have enough food of your own?  
Well, yes.  
How do you get it?  
Bees make it.  
I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it!  
There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing!  
It's organic.  
It's our-ganic!  
It's just honey, Barry.  
Just what?!  
Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing!  
You've taken our homes, schools,hospitals! This is all we have!  
And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this.  
I'm getting to the bottom of all of this!  
Hey, Hector. You almost done?  
Almost.  
He is here. I sense it.  
Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around.  
You're busted, box boy!  
I knew I heard something.  
So you can talk!  
I can talk. And now you'll start talking!  
Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier?  
I don't understand.  
I thought we were friends.  
The last thing we want to do is upset bees!  
You're too late! It's ours now!  
You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword!  
You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio!  
Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where!  
Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms!  
Crazy person!  
What horrible thing has happened here?  
These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now  
they're on the road to nowhere!  
Just keep still.  
What? You're not dead?  
Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed?  
To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here.  
I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off!  
I'm going to Tacoma.  
And you?  
He really is dead.  
All right.  
Uh-oh!  
What is that?!  
Oh, no!  
A wiper! Triple blade!  
Triple blade?  
Jump on! It's your only chance, bee!  
Why does everything have  
to be so doggone clean?!  
How much do you people need to see?!  
Open your eyes!  
Stick your head out the window!  
From NPR News in Washington,  
I'm Carl Kasell.  
But don't kill no more bugs!  
Bee!  
Moose blood guy!!  
You hear something?  
Like what?  
Like tiny screaming.  
Turn off the radio.  
Whassup, bee boy?  
Hey, Blood.  
Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see.  
Wow!  
I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours.  
Bees hang tight. We're all jammed in.  
It's a close community.  
Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own.  
What if you get in trouble?  
You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack!  
At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls.  
Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito.  
You got to be kidding me!  
Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee!  
Hey, guys!  
Mooseblood!  
I knew I'd catch y'all down here.  
Did you bring your crazy straw?  
We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit.  
What is this place?  
A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead.  
They are pinheads!  
Pinhead.  
Check out the new smoker.  
Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000!  
Smoker?  
Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out.  
They make the honey, and we make the money.  
""They make the honey, and we make the money""?  
Oh, my!  
What's going on? Are you OK?  
Yeah. It doesn't last too long.  
Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls?  
Our queen was moved here. We had no choice.  
This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen!  
What is this?  
Oh, no!  
There's hundreds of them!  
Bee honey.  
Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale!  
This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something.  
Oh, Barry, stop.  
Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor.  
Do these look like rumors?  
That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this?  
He's been talking to humans.  
What? Talking to humans?!  
He has a human girlfriend. And they make out!  
Make out? Barry!  
We do not.  
You wish you could.  
Whose side are you on?  
The bees!  
I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night.  
Barry, this is what you want to do with your life?  
I want to do it for all our lives. Nobody works harder than bees!  
Dad, I remember you coming home so overworked  
your hands were still stirring. You couldn't stop.  
I remember that.  
What right do they have to our honey?  
We live on two cups a year. They put it in lip balm for no reason whatsoever!  
Even if it's true, what can one bee do?  
Sting them where it really hurts.  
In the face! The eye!  
That would hurt.  
No.  
Up the nose? That's a killer.  
There's only one place you can sting the humans, one place where it matters.  
Hive at Five, The Hive's only full-hour action news source.  
No more bee beards!  
With Bob Bumble at the anchor desk. Weather with Storm Stinger. Sports with Buzz Larvi. And Jeanette Chung.  
Good evening. I'm Bob Bumble.  
And I'm Jeanette Ohung.  
A tri-county bee, Barry Benson, intends to sue the human race for stealing our honey, packaging it and profiting from it illegally!  
Tomorrow night on Bee Larry King, we'll have three former queens here in our studio, discussing their new book, classy Ladies, out this week on Hexagon.  
Tonight we're talking to Barry Benson.  
Did you ever think, ""I'm a kid from The Hive. I can't do this""?  
Bees have never been afraid to change the world.

**Bing.**
My phone chimed, breaking my attention from this spaghetti code.

> Henry : Sorry for the late reply, I slept like a log after the day I had.

*Focus, Sandra. Sprint first. Date second.*
I forced my attention back to my screen. ""Okay, so this module routes the request to—"" 

**Bing**. 

> Henry: So here's where I stand, Chinese, a hundred percent.

*What?! He's insane.* 
I grabbed my phone, fingers flying. 

> Sandra: Umm excuse me??

> Sandra: Have you tried *real* ramen??

> Sandra: Not the one you buy from that overly crowded Japanese fast food restaurant where its customers consists of families teaching their children that that's authentic. That's just blasphemy.

I put my phone down, glancing at the screen before me. Dual monitors covered in code. My desk had the usual—lightly drunk iced coffee, a pink Stanley tumbler on standby, and an ancient sticky note threatening to detach from the monitor's edge. 

**Bing.**

> Henry: Umm I just got back from Sapporo hello?

> Henry: Of course I know how yum *real* ramens are.

> Henry: But have *you* tried *real* lanzhou beef noodles? And not the semi-authentic ones that you have at business dinners.


> Sandra: Okay Mr. Worldwide... Touché.

> Sandra: Well I'm not there yet... But Chongqing is on my bucket list.

> Sandra: Until then, I'll just put a pin on this ""World's best noodle debate.""

A pat on my shoulder startled me.

""Glad to see that you're hard at work.""
Thank God it's just Steph.

""Haha yeah, I'm just trying to figure out what the hell was Nathan thinking writing this.""

""Yeah that's not what I'm talking about."" 
Stephanie pointed at my phone. Smirking. 
""How's the booty hunt going?""

""Yeah I've been talking to this guy, Henry. I think that there could be a connection here.""

Stephanie groaned, she paced to the window overlooking at the park across us.
""Come on, everybody *needs* a palate cleanser after a breakup.""
Taking a couple of steps towards me, she continued. 
""The only similarity you need is like.. Oh you eat lunch? Me too! Let's knock some boots.""

I chuckled.
""Haha well, I'm not sure I'll feel comfortable enough though.""

Stephanie shrugged.
""Fair enough.""

**Bing.**

> Henry sends a picture

> Henry: It's not much, but it'll do.

Stephanie and I glanced at the glowing phone, She gasped.

""Sandra you bad bad bitch, at work? Come on...""

""N-N-No no it's not like tha—we send each other pictures of our food, you know... to plan the perfect date?""

""Wow... The pressure.""

""It'll be fine... Right...?""

Stephanie groaned.
""Have I taught you nothing? The first date is the easiest. Let the dude pay and if he's hot enough, just gently knee his John. He'll get it and boom! Bye bye thoughts of Adi. Simplicity itself.""

I nodded.
""Yeah... I'll do that."" *As if.*

""Anyways get back to me by the end of the day, I will be waiting.""
Stephanie gave a slight wave, leaving my workstation.

""Umm... I assume you're talking about the—""

""The dude of course!""
She glanced back one last time as she was leaving, grinning, continuing.
""But I'll need to review the code before we the rebase.""

""Yes sir.""

I wanted to reply to Henry, but the hustler inside me forced me to shove my phone into my desk drawer and continue working. I put on my noise-cancelling headphones, lofi girl on YouTube playing.

*Okay I'll talk to you later,  Henry. Let's focus.*

I shifted fully my focus on my screen.

*Alright Sandra, where was I... Right, so every time the user types a word, it sends a request to the server instead of caching it first.*

I was entering my flow state—code clicked, logic aligned, everything else blurred. Algorithms from uni came back like muscle memory. But–

**Bloop.**

> Bagas: Some testers got a weird issue with the ""Archive"" button in dark mode. It vanishes whenever they clicked on the moon icon.

*Crap, Slack messages. Oh it's just the front end stuff. I'll read it later.*
I hid the notification banner, and turned on Do Not Disturb mode.

*Very well, let's continue.*

The monitor's glow was steady and cool, a portal into logic and chaos. With no more bloops, I was locked in.



I noticed from my right side the sky had turned from blue to tangerine by the time I completed the revision. I pushed the code for Stephanie to review. It was a good day of work. But an uncomfortable feeling gnawed inside me. I put down my headphones, took a sip of water, and opened my desk drawer to reach for my phone.

*Oh crap! I missed an important meeting!!*

> Rayhan: Hey were you in the sync? My team got confused about the archive thing—can you confirm if it's still on the V2 endpoint?



> Stephanie: You better be exchanging bodily fluids with some guy rn or else...

> Stephanie: WRU??

> Stephanie: Meeting starts soon.

> Stephanie: Don't forget about the meeting at 3, we have a bug on the app and needed to check if the issue is from your end.

*Fuck.*

I chucked my stuff to my bag, and ran like hell trying to catch Stephanie. The office was almost deserted, it seemed like everyone had left. As I was nearing the elevator, the LED indicated that it was at fifth floor heading down. I was at the third floor. Stephanie on sixth. 

*Stairs? Might arrive sweaty but I gotta hurry.*

The stairwell was right next to the elevator, but I almost never use it because my position is not *that* collaborative yet. I ran up the stairs.

As I neared the sixth floor, Stephanie's glass-walled office came into view. Her post-it notes scattered on the whiteboard. She was zipping up her bag when our eyes met.

""Duuude! Where were you?""
She stopped her packing, standing upright, as if she's towering over me.

""I-I-I'm sorry... I was...""

*Think!! Come on... find a good reason to keep my job safe.*

""...Err...""

*I was in the bathroom? No no... No one goes to the bathroom THAT long in the office and missed a meeting.*

About five seconds has passed. Stephanie had her gaze locked on me. She had an unnerving smirk, her stare was cold. Too cold.

""Well...?""
She continued.

Man... I can't believe I let her down. She was my senior at uni, she got me this job.

""I...""

*Damn it... Say something.*

""...""

*Words... Out of... Mouth... Remember?*

Stephanie broke the silence.
""Do you have any idea what you missed?""
She crossed her arms, with her smirk gone.

""The prod crashed because the backend had triggered a loop and our server usage spiked—we even had someone from AWS on the meeting, explaining that our bills were just BUT it takes a huge dent in the company's capital. The managers weren’t happy.""

My heart dropped. I was speechless.

""Well?""

*Okay... She's your friend. Just apologize...*

I couldn't feel my legs. I could feel my heartbeat on my sleeves. I wanted to breathe, but it felt like no air was coming in and out.

""I'm... Sorry... It's all my fault.""

The air was thick. The sixth floor had no one else but us. She could yell at me if she want to. I would. God knows how much money I cost the company.

Suddenly she burst out of laughter. Hysterically, I might add.
""HAHAHAHA YOU SHOULD HAVE SEEN THE LOOK ON YOUR FACE""

""Huh? But what about the bill?""

""Noo silly, it was just a weekly sync up between the front-end and the back-end. Don't worry, I covered for you.""

""You asshole. I almost cried.""

She continued laughing. I laughed too, shakily, but the guilt didn't fully leave. 

""Hahaha... Anyways, let's get outta here and grab a bite while you explain your absence.""
Stephanie grabbed her bag and flipped the switch in her office.

""Sure...""

We walked and waited for the elevator.

""So were you video chatting with the mystery man? Because if so... I get it girl, I too need some action.""

""Oh shoot! I forgot to text him back.""
I fumbled and checked my phone.

> Henry: Soo.....

> Henry: What did you have for lunch?

""Ugh... I hadn't text back.""

As we entered Stephanie had a quiet smile, as if she just saw a kindergartener.
""You're so sweet... Leave it on read yet but don't reply yet.""
She exhaled.
""Men looooove games.""

I nodded.

She looked at me continuing.
""So? Why weren't you in the meeting?""

""This may sound silly... But I *kinda* put my computer on Do Not Disturb... I was in the zone you know?""

""Ahh I see... Rookie mistake.""

The elevator dinged. We were going out through the basement.

Stephanie lit up her cigarette as we were walking.

""You see, I know you're an amazing coder Sand. That's why I recommended you for this job. But all your best works like the AR music controller thing using Webcam or the terminal-based video player using ASCII characters, they're all you and fully yours.""

She stopped walking and looked directly at me.

""But you need to learn to work with other people. Because I can't keep covering for you every time you mess up and eventually when you're a C-level, you need to be accountable.""

""Yeah... And... Thanks Steph... For everything.""

""You're welcome.""

Stephanie smiled, continuing the walk to her car.

""By the way, where did you park?""

""Oh no I didn't bring my car. I'm not immune to parking fee...like you.""

""Cool! We can just take my car and we'll go to *RamenZ*. I'm jonesing for something with nice soup right now.""

I exhaled.
""Alright.""

I got into Stephanie's car and put my bag at the back, I took out my phone and replied to Henry.

> Sandra: I didn't have lunch.

> Sandra: Work was *crazy.*

> Sandra: But you won't believe where I'm going to rn.

Stephanie plugged her phone in and set the GPS to *RamenZ*, and played some songs. 

""Hopefully the traffic will be a *little bit* kinder today.""

I replied.
""Crossing my fingers.""

I held my phone within my hands, as we were cruising the motorcycle-infested road with roaring klaxons and super loud exhaust systems from some *Angkots* battling against the sound of Justin Bieber's *""Love Yourself""* playing in the background.

**Bing.**

> Henry: Hmm...

> Henry: KFC?

""Oooh, is that the mystery man?""
Stephanie added.

""His name is Henry, not a mystery.""
I was unlocking my phone, trying reply to him.

""So tell me about him, where did you guys meet? Are you on the dating apps? I'm on several you know.""

""No no... He's... An old acquaintance. You remember the Batavia University job fair back in 2019?""

""Sure I remember, but I didn't attend... Had a job already so I didn't feel the need to attend, but carry on. Wait. Is he one of us?""

""Well he's one of you. He's had a job back then, and he was working for this ecofriendly energy company. We talked a bit, exchanged Insta but I was with Adi at the time. I didn't talk to him a lot back then, we both lived our lives separately. But a few weeks ago I was sharing an Insta story about how some guy hit on me, and I complained ab–""

""Oh yeahh... Gross. Continue.""

""As I was saying... he slid into my dm, talking about how hard dating is and... Well...""

Stephanie nodded her head.
""Got it.""

I replied back to Henry.

>Sandra: Guess again...

>Sandra: You have 2 attempts left.



We pulled up to *RamenZ* about half an hour later, despite it's only 5 kilometers away from the office. The parking lot was packed, but thankfully we found a spot. Opening up the cheesily-decorated Japanese-styled door, we were greeted with what feels like an ocean of people waiting for a spot for a table. Stephanie walked straight up to the hostess.

""Table for two please""

The hostess was wearing a gimmicky white and red colored kimono, with a smile that seems as fake as the restaurant's 'authentic' Japanese decor.

""Certainly *kak*, you're 17th on the waiting list.""

""Okay, how long will that take?""

""It's impossible to tell for certain, but expect around an hour of wait time.""

*Wow... That many people are that desperate for a faux-Japanese food huh?*

Sandra looked at me, asking.
""Are you okay with the wait time? We can find another one if you're super hungry.""

I faked a smile, I know I didn't have to fake any enthusiasm because she's my friend. However she's *technically* my boss, and I already messed up today.
""Not at all it's fine... Besides I have Henry to keep me company.""

""Show off. Alright then, let's find somewhere to sit.""

I stealthily took a picture of the hostess counter along with the swarm of people waiting for their turn, sending the picture to Henry.

> You sent a picture.

> Sandra: My dinner for today, an 'authentic' Japanese food.

Henry responded with a cry-laughing emoji.

## What is Immediate 14X Cormax?

Immediate 14X Cormax is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other digital assets using AI-powered tools. It’s built to analyze market data in real-time, identify trading opportunities, and execute trades on your behalf—pretty much like hiring a digital assistant who never sleeps.

What makes it interesting is its claim to combine **machine learning algorithms** with real-time market trends to make trades that are supposedly smarter and faster than human capabilities. It’s geared not just toward crypto veterans but also newbies who want to get started without learning every technical detail of the market.

## Who Created Immediate 14X Cormax?

The platform’s creators are a bit of a mystery—something that’s kind of common in the crypto space. There’s no publicly available founder or company profile, which can be a little sketchy for some people. But from what I’ve seen, this setup is similar to other platforms like **Bitcoin Era** and **Immediate Edge**, which also operate under anonymous or semi-anonymous teams.

That being said, the platform appears to be managed by a group of fintech developers and trading veterans who’ve worked behind the scenes to bring their algorithm to life. While some transparency would be nice, the functionality and user feedback so far suggest it’s not just a fly-by-night operation.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Immediate 14X Cormax Today](https://t.co/Ay7AT9rQmd)
## How Does Immediate 14X Cormax Work?

Immediate 14X Cormax uses **automated trading algorithms** to scan the market 24/7, looking for price movements and patterns that fit its trading strategy. When it finds a profitable opportunity, it executes the trade automatically—no manual input needed.

Here’s a rough breakdown of the process:

- You deposit funds (minimum $250).
- The algorithm monitors the market in real-time.
- Based on pre-set parameters or AI logic, it places buy/sell orders.
- Profits (or losses) are reflected in your account balance.

It also offers a **demo mode**, which is great for testing the waters without risking real cash. Honestly, the automation is what makes it appealing for people who don’t have time to sit in front of charts all day.

## Immediate 14X Cormax Pros and Cons

Let’s be real—no platform is perfect. But here’s what I found useful (and not so useful) about Immediate 14X Cormax.

### ✅ Pros:

- Desktop computers
- Laptops
- Tablets
- Smartphones (both iOS and Android)

The responsive design makes it feel like a native app, even when using a mobile browser. So yeah, you can check your trades while waiting in line for coffee.

## Immediate 14X Cormax – Supported Countries

Immediate 14X Cormax is available in most countries, but there are a few exceptions due to **regulatory restrictions**.

From what I can tell, it's supported in:

- Most of Europe (UK, Germany, France, etc.)
- Australia and New Zealand
- Canada
- South America
- Some parts of Asia and Africa

It’s **not available** in the U.S. and a few other highly regulated markets. Always double-check your local laws before signing up.

## Immediate 14X Cormax – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

This feature is where the platform shines. The algorithm continuously scans the market and reacts to opportunities faster than you or I ever could. It’s like having a Wall Street analyst in your pocket who never takes a break.

## Is Immediate 14X Cormax a Scam?

This is the million-dollar question. After digging into it and testing it myself, I’d say **no, it’s not a scam**, but it’s always smart to approach with caution.

There are actual users reporting positive returns, and the platform does what it says: it automates trades based on market data. But like any trading tool, there’s risk involved. It's definitely **not a guaranteed way to get rich**, and anyone who claims otherwise is full of it.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Immediate 14X Cormax?

To get started, you’ll need to deposit **$250**. This is pretty standard among similar platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

That initial amount goes directly into your trading account and can be used for live trades. It’s not a fee—it’s your capital.

### Immediate 14X Cormax Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7**, and you can reach them via:

- Live chat (once signed in)
- Email support

The response time was pretty quick when I tested it—got a reply within a couple of hours via email. Live chat obviously works faster.

We are just  2 weeks into no contact. It is so absolutely hard. Everything I see makes me want to reach out to her. She was my person. When we broke up, she was definitely torn about it. We both cried so much. She told her mom something to the effect of ""idk. I know he would be a great husband and father but I'm just so overwhelmed."" I moved out, and while splitting up our stuff I told her I plan on asking her out again and trying again. She said she really wanted that. And then anytime I decided i had to leave something, she would make the joke that ""You're coming back it's okay."" We spent a few weeks trying to limit contact. No big conversations, just small snaps here and there. I reached out to see if she wanted to meet up. Not for a date or to jump back into things. Just to kind of keep in touch and catch up. Maybe just a cup of coffee or a walk or something. At that point she told me that she had kind of lost hope that things will work the way I want them too, especially in the time frame I want them to. She said that we haven't even done the ""no contact"" properly like we should. I was devastated. Cried a bit. But told her I will respect her wishes. She will not hear from me, and Know that I will always love you, and if you decide it is worth trying, that i would be open to the conversation. I am not sure if I will have the courage to reach out to her at any point. But if I do I hope you would be open to hearing me out. And she said of course. 
3 days after we went radio silence she sent me a Tik Tok while I was at work. Which I was like whatever. And then texted me later about something going wrong at work in her office, completely unprompted and out if the blue. I assumed it was just out of habit and I haven't heard anything since then. 
She is absolutely everything I want. I am focusing on working on myself for myself. Not for her. But I am still holding hope that we can work it out. I am going to therapy, learning to cope with my attachment style. I am getting back into the gym. I am trying new things. New trips with friends. Finding myself again. But I know that the sense of self that I find is still going to want her. She was honestly everything I ever wanted. Our relationship was amazing. She understood my love language and I understood hers. It was literally the time of my life. It came out that she has trouble voicing her emotions and feelings. Which led to resentment. That plus a whole lot of outside stress led to her to getting overwhelmed. 
Is it at all possible to reconnect? Not anytime soon obviously. I have some work to do on myself. But in a couple months is it completely out of the question?",7,1747118467.0,BreakUps,4,1.0,False

## What is Bitveda Flow?

Bitveda Flow is a **smart trading platform** that uses automation and real-time analytics to help users trade crypto and other financial assets. Think of it as your **AI-powered sidekick** that scans the markets 24/7, identifies trends, and executes trades based on preset strategies.

It’s designed to **reduce the learning curve** for newbies while still being powerful enough for more experienced traders. Whether you're into **Bitcoin, Ethereum, Forex**, or even **commodities**, Bitveda Flow offers a single dashboard to manage it all.

The platform’s main selling point? It takes the guesswork out of trading. That means less time stressing over charts and more time doing literally anything else.

## Who Created Bitveda Flow?

Bitveda Flow was developed by a team of **fintech engineers and market analysts** with experience in building trading algorithms. While the platform doesn’t spotlight a single founder like Elon or Satoshi, that’s not unusual in the auto-trading space.

The people behind Bitveda Flow claim to have backgrounds in **quantitative finance, AI development**, and **blockchain technology**. Based on the interface and underlying tools, I’d say they know what they’re doing. It’s got a polished feel that a weekend coding project just wouldn’t replicate.

Still, I always wish platforms would be a bit more transparent about the people behind the curtain. It helps build trust, and it’s one of the few areas where Bitveda Flow could improve.

## How Does Bitveda Flow Work?

At its core, Bitveda Flow uses **automated trading algorithms** to scan markets and execute trades. Here's how the system breaks down:

- **Execution**: Trades are placed through partner brokers instantly, without you lifting a finger.
- **Monitoring**: You can track trades live, adjust risk settings, and pause automation whenever you want.

Bonus: there’s **demo trading** so you can test everything before risking real money. That’s a huge win if you're still testing the waters in crypto or forex.

## Bitveda Flow Pros and Cons

I did an endoscopy a  few days ago due to waking up with what felt like food sitting in my throat and when I went to go throw it up, noticed some blood. So results came back and said that my esophagus and duodenum are normal but said they found chronic mild inflammation in my stomach but its weird because I’ve never felt pain in my stomach, mostly in the middle of my chest do I feel pressure and burning sensation. So its not making any sense to me. I don’t see my GI until a couple days from now but wanted to see if anyone’s been on the same boat or going through the same thing I’m going through right now. I’m currently in the ER right now for the same type of episode again but its still resonates in the chest and not the stomach. I came to the ER cause I was vomiting what looked like digested blood and test positive for blood in vomiting so I’m awaiting results from CT scan to see if anything else is going on. The vomit was forceful due to me straining to me vomit cause I was sick of that burning/full feeling in my chest and all that was coming out was sputum and brown streaks/wet looking coffee grinds. They gave me some anti acids but I can still feel the acid come up every time I need to burp. Please let me know your thoughts and experiences. Thank you.",2,1747118191.0,Gastritis,1,1.0,False
1klf6s2,https://i.redd.it/fhs8pqniqh0f1.png,"Blackbeard learned to inherit 3 Devil Fruits from Xebec, who also had 3!","**TL;DR:** Blackbeard’s mastery of multiple Devil Fruits isn’t a one-off, but the rediscovery of an ancient precedent set by Rocks D. Xebec that was then deliberately erased by both Xebec’s own crew and the World Government. Xebec’s name, crew, and heritage all point toward him being a hidden triple-Fruit user and BB may be the living blade of Xebec’s will.

# 1. Blackbeard as a Historian, Not an Inventor

* Teach read every historical and archaeological text he could find about Devil Fruits and Void Century lore. He wasn't someone who invented ideas, he learned them. Same with the idea of eating more than one Fruit.
* The Rocks Pirates’ history was scrubbed after the God Valley Incident by Xebec's Crew and the World Government, which is a pretty convenient way for Oda to hide Xebec's 3 Fruit usage.

# 2. Xebec’s Name & the “Z-Laugh” Connection

* A xebec (also spelled with a Z, ""Zebec!"") is a Barbary corsair ship which had three sails.
* As stated, “Zebec” can be spelled with a Z, just like Blackbeard’s signature “Zehahahaha!” laugh. Contrast that with Luffy’s “Ah-hya-hya-hya,"" which starts with ""A.""
* A versus Z, sun versus night. Luffy is foreshadowed as the Sun God; Teach is his Darkness counterpart.

# 3. Nullifying Power: Awakened Yami Yami no Mi

* Big Mom, Kaido, Whitebeard all served under Xebec. How do you keep such Devil Fruit users in line?
* Xebec may have wielded an early form of the Yami Yami no Mi’s awakening, granting him the ability to “nullify” other Fruits at will, which would make his crew unable to overthrow him.
* The Yami Yami’s unique effect could suppress the lethal effect that occurs when you eat more than one Fruit, allowing Xebec and Blackbeard to survive having multiple Fruits.
* If nullification must be actively maintained, sleep would be fatal, explaining why Teach and perhaps Xebec never rest.

# 4. “D.” Lineage: Inherited Will over Bloodline

* There are very few candidates left who Oda could choose as the “special lineage”  that the World Government hinted Blackbeard had.
* That said, it might even be that Teach is a devoted follower of Xebec’s dream of overturning the world order. This matches Oda’s emphasis on “Inherited Will” rather than literal blood inheritance.
* Teach carries the same middle initial, the same motto for chaos, and the same appetite for forbidden knowledge as Xebec.

# 5. “Xebec’s Saber”: The Sword of His Will

* Blackbeard’s ship, the **Saber of Xebec**, isn’t a random tribute. It literally means he’s carrying the blade of Xebec’s will forward through history.
* Every raid Teach undertakes, every power he steals, is another swing of Xebec's saber and another step toward fulfilling Xebec’s long-lost ambition.

1klf5iw,https://www.reddit.com/r/RetirementReady/comments/1klf5iw/staying_socially_active_for_increased_vitality_in/,Staying Socially Active for Increased Vitality in Retirement,"**Is retirement really about endless days in front of the TV? Or can it be a vibrant, social adventure?**  

Let’s face it—after decades of hard work, the idea of kicking back and enjoying life sounds like a dream. But it can also turn into a bit of a nightmare if we don’t stay connected with the world around us. When the daily grind isn’t weighing us down, it can be easy to slip into isolation.  

**But here’s the kicker: staying socially active can actually give you more vitality in retirement!** Think of it as an energy drink that doesn’t come in a can. 🌞  

So, how do we make sure we’re not just vegetating in front of the TV, scrolling through social media (with the occasional “scroll back” to our younger selves)? Let’s break it down:  

### 1. **Connect with Old Friends**  
There’s something heartwarming about reminiscing about the good old days. Why not set a lunch date or a coffee catch-up with that friend you haven’t seen in ages? Plus, if you share a laugh over that time they **almost** gave you a black eye during a game of charades, it’s bound to revive some great memories!  

### 2. **Join Clubs or Groups**  
Whether it's a book club, hiking group, or even pottery class, immersing yourself in activities with others can be incredibly fulfilling. Plus, it offers a chance to meet new friends! Who knows—you might find your next bestie or partner in crime for future mischief.   

### 3. **Volunteer**  
Giving back keeps you engaged and provides a sense of purpose. Whether it’s at a local animal shelter or a community garden, you’d be amazed at how much fun it can be! And to top it off, you’ll meet folks who share your passion.  

### 4. **Coach or Mentor**  
If you’ve got skills to share, see if there’s a local school or organization in need of some extra hands. Teaching a class or mentoring others is not only a way to stay active, but it’s also super rewarding. You’ll be surprised what a little encouragement can do for someone who looks up to you.  

### 5. **Keep Learning**  
Embrace the “forever learner” mentality! From cooking classes to learning a new language (ever tried doing it on Duolingo while waiting in line?), staying mentally engaged can keep your spirits high and your social calendar full.  

By the way, when it comes to staying on track, remember: **Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.** It’s a mantra that can make all the difference in ensuring you’re not just busy but fulfilled! If you’re curious about how you can enhance your planning for an engaging retirement, check this out: [Set realistic goals. Stay focused. Go home satisfied.](https://mavely.app.link/e/qBribQrKcTb)  

To wrap it up, think about your retirement. Are you on course for an adventure, or are you risking the couch potato life? Whatever you choose, just know the world is waiting for you to dive back into it! 🙌  

So, what connections have you made since hanging up those work boots? What's been the highlight of your social calendar lately? 🌟",1,1747117995.0,RetirementReady,0,1.0,False

Finally stopped the big losses, but that's ok, didn't expect the huge numbers to continue. I am incorporating walking and weight lifting starting this week, and keeping up with multivitamins and water. Still doing well with the Fullerton meal replacement scoop in my black coffee, grilled chicken with veggies for lunch, and more chicken/veg or protein shakes for dinner. Snacks are either beef jerky or another protein shake.   Protein goal adjusted from 110 g to 106 g. 

Starting Weight: 243.2, Goal Weight after Six Week Cycle: 210

Week 1: 234.6, - 8.4 lbs

Week 2: 229.8, - 4.8 lbs

Week 3: 228.3, -1.5 lbs, down 14.7 pounds total. 

I did have a cheat meal of chicken haleem with white rice and sourdough bread.

Question for those PSMFing currently - when do you have your cheat meal? I think I should move mine to the day of my morning weekly weigh-in to minimize mental worries about it affecting the scale.....

The full conversation unraveled before me-talk of sneaking around after meetings,making excuses for""work dinners,""and even plans to continue their affair after the wedding. The worst part;he was doing it with my trusted employee,Claire Winslow. After spending days crying and feeling desperate,I knew I had to do something. I made a ten-step revenge plan,and the first step was to gather evidence. ———————— Evidence Paul and I had been together for over ten years,building a business,planning a future,and getting ready for the wedding of our dreams.But one click changed everything. I stumbled upon a shared document in his Cloud Drive-a document that wasn't meant for me.It was filled with secret rendezvous plans,love notes,and hotel receipts. The worst part;he was doing it with my trusted employee,Claire Winslow.In that moment,something inside me snapped. Our perfect life?A lie.Our business?No longer his.And this wedding?It wasn't going to be canceled-it was going to be the start of their downfall. I wasn't the heartbroken fiancee who would quietly walk away.No,I would take everything.Brick by brick,I would destroy them both.They thought they could cheat and get away with it.They had no idea who they were messing with. I was knee-deep in wedding planning,juggling work while preparing for the biggest day of my life. One evening,as I finalized our wedding invites,I shared the guest list with my fiance,Paul Foster,on Cloud Drive. He was away for a business conference,so this was our way of staying organized. Everything seemed perfect-until something strange caught my eye. A few days ago,he logged into his email on my laptop,so today I accidentally opened the drive using his account. As I scrolled through the folders,I noticed the latest edited document that I didn't recognize.It was titled [Business Projections-Q3.]Boring,typical.But something about it felt off.I hadn't created it,and it wasn't part of any current project. Curiosity got the better of me. I clicked on it,expecting a dry business file. Instead,it opened to a short message: [Can't stop thinking about that night at the hotel...next time I'll wear red]My stomach dropped.This wasn't some business document.It was shared with only Paul and this email I had never seen before: was definitely off. Shaking,I checked the document history. The full conversation unraveled before me -talk of sneaking around after meetings,making excuses for""work dinners,""and even plans to continue their affair after the wedding,like it was just a bump in the road to their perfect little secret. I stared at the screen,disbelief crashing over me.They had been using our business as cover for their affair,planning romantic weekends while I had been pouring my heart into our future. The document wasn't even hidden.He had gotten so comfortable,so careless,that he didn't bother to erase the evidence.

# And now,here it was in his shared folder,staring me in the face like a twisted gift from the universe. ""Hey,sorry,Ruby.I can't make it today. Can you do the food tasting with your mom?""he said when I called to remind him about our appointment.Same excuse,different day.I bit my tongue and forced a light tone.""Yeah,sure.Just don't overwork yourself,alright?"" As soon as the call ended,I clenched my fists.His time was coming.I would definitely make it happen. After spending days crying and feeling desperate,I knew I had to do something.I made a ten-step revenge plan,and the first step was to gather evidence. Without him suspecting a thing,I scoured his phone,emails,and financial records,seeking undeniable proof of his affair. We had always kept things simple,sharing one WeCloud account for our devices.It was convenient for syncing our calendars,documents,and photos.As I browsed through my phone's photo gallery,I noticed new images had been synced from his device. Most of them were mundane-screenshots of emails,photos from work trips.But then,mixed in between,I found a photo that didn't belong.It was a picture of Claire Winslow,our employee,in lingerie,posing in front of a mirror in a hotel room. My chest tightened,and I quickly swiped,hoping it was a mistake.But the next photo was even worse-him,shirtless in the same room,grinning at the camera.This confirmed the affair between the two of them. Then,one afternoon,while I was working from home and he was supposedly still in a meeting,I opened the Streamify app to play our usual playlist.That was when I noticed a recently added playlist titled [Late Nights.]It wasn't our music,and it wasn't public.Curious,I clicked on it. It was filled with romantic songs we had never listened to,with titles like ""Secret Love Song,""""Wildest Dreams,""and ""Dirty Little Secret..""I then saw her profile-Claire-had been adding songs too,with little love notes in the description:[For our weekend getaway,[That night.]I realized they had been secretly sharing songs,creating a world I had no idea about. The playlist was their own soundtrack to the affair. It took me a few weeks,as I was busy with work and wedding preparations.But once I had it all-the secret meetings,inappropriate messages,and even hotel receipts-I filed them away for later.My goal was to strike when it would hurt the most.

# Isolating Taking Over The second step was to isolate him socially. I knew that cutting him off from our social circles had to be done carefully-slowly,without raising any [alarms.So](http://alarms.So),I started small,weaving stories into casual conversations. At brunch with our mutual friends,I would bring up how he had been ""so busy lately. ""Oh,he's been out of town a lot recently,""I would say with a sigh,playing the understanding fiancee.""I get it;he's got work meetings and all,but with the wedding coming up,I wish he could be around more."" It was the kind of thing that made people sympathetic but also raised a silent red flag. I played it off,always smiling,as if it were no big deal.But as I dropped these little tidbits,I could see doubt flicker in their eyes. As the days passed,I continued to paint a picture of a man who was distracted,distant,and maybe even a little unreliable. When some of his friends,who happened to work with me,asked how the wedding planning was going,I would tell them,""Oh,you know,he's got his hands full with work,so I've been handling most of the details on my own.He's busy flying out for meetings every few days.But that okay-he's stressed;I get it."" The more I shared these seemingly innocent remarks,the more people started to question his commitment.They would murmur behind his back,wondering why he was leaving me to handle everything alone when our wedding was just around the corner. Friends would text me to ""check in,"" concerned about how I was holding up. Some even voiced their doubts,saying things like,""It's kind of weird he's not more involved,don't you think?"" I would laugh it off,acting like the supportive partner,but I knew exactly what I was doing.With each conversation,the seeds of doubt were taking root.Slowly but surely,people began to drift away from him,Some of his""bro""stopped inviting him out for drinks,probably afraid to take more of his time.Others made excuses when he reached out,claiming they were ""too busy'""to meet up. I wasn't openly accusing him of anything -that would have made me look suspicious.Instead,I played the role of the devoted fiancee who""understood""why her fiance was so absent. But behind the scenes,I was gradually turning our friends against him,leaving him isolated,with fewer people to lean on. In their eyes,I was the patient bride-to-be,doing everything to make the relationship work,while he seemed too preoccupied to care.Little by little,our mutual friends began siding with me,their loyalties shifting as I subtly rewrote the narrative of our relationship.He never even saw it coming.

# While he was distracted by his affair,I took the opportunity to set the third step in motion,carefully and deliberately taking control of our shared business assets. It wasn't something that could happen overnight-he was too involved in the business for that.So I played the long game,working behind the scenes while he focused on sneaking around with her. First,I started with small changes-documents he barely noticed.Whenever we had meetings with our accountant or legal team,I would act as if I was just being thorough,asking to review contracts and paperwork that we had already signed. He would wave me off,too distracted to pay attention.""You handle it,""he would say,. shrugging as though our finances were the least of his worries.That was exactly what I wanted. I made sure I was always the one to handle the paperwork.If there was a contract to sign,I would volunteer to deal with it. When our accountant sent over forms for investments or property holdings,I would tell him I'd take care of it-making sure to slip in additional clauses or have certain assets quietly listed under my name. He was so distracted by his affair that he never questioned why I was suddenly so involved in the details. The key was in the subtlety.I couldn't make any drastic changes too quickly,or he might have caught on.Instead,I slowly began transferring small portions of our shared investments into accounts that I controlled. When we bought new equipment for the business,I ensured the purchase orders listed me as the sole owner.I even had some of our most important contracts rewritten,making sure my name was on every significant legal document. To protect myself,I worked with a lawyer he didn't know about-someone who specialized in business takeovers and asset protection. Together,we built a watertight case,ensuring that if he ever tried to challenge me,I would have the upper hand.I gathered every piece of evidence I needed to prove that the assets were rightfully mine. As the weeks passed,I took control of the accounts one by one-our investments,our business holdings,even the bank accounts that funded our day-to-day operations.It was a slow,deliberate process. I made sure not to leave any obvious traces or do anything that would alert him.He was still wrapped up in his double life,too distracted to notice the slow takeover of everything we had built together. There were moments when he would glance at a statement or bring up a concern about the business,but I always had a quick answer ready. """"It's all under control,""I would say with a reassuring smile,and he would nod,relieved that I was handling it.Little did he know,I was preparing to take everything away from him. By the time he realized something was off,it would already be too late.The business he thought we shared would be mine every asset,every investment,and every piece of property that mattered.He would be left with nothing.

Sabotage the Mistress Claire Winslow wasn't just his secret lover -she was also one of our longest-standing employees,practically there from day one. She held a key role in the company,which made things tricky,but also gave me a direct path to ruin them both.If I played my cards right,I wouldn't just take down their affair-I would wreck their careers altogether. I knew I couldn'tjust expose their affair without consequences,so instead,I focused on systematically dismantling her role in the company,piece by piece.This was the fourth step. First thing first,I needed to start planting bad seeds.Whenever Claire and I discussed potential business leads or new partnerships,,I would""accidentally""slip her false information. I told her about meetings with supposed investors who were difficult to work with or potential clients with bad reputations.I always phrased it like it was a tip-off or insider in-fo,so she would not question it too much. ""Hey,Claire,""I would say casually over coffee,""I heard from a contact that there's this huge investor interested in our market. Maybe it's worth a look?"" Of course,the deals would always fail.The investors I sent her to either were not interested or had a reputation for being impossible to work with. Claire started fumbling through meetings,looking more and more incompetent in front of the board.Word about her screw-ups spread fast,and she had no idea I was the one pulling the strings. Nobody called her out directly,but it was clear-she was slowly being iced out.Fewer meetings,no one asking for her [input.It](http://input.It) was only a matter of time. But I didn't stop there.While she was busy chasing bad leads,I worked behind the scenes to rally the rest of the team around me.I made myself the indispensable leader,the one who got things done. Whenever Claire made mistakes,I was there to fix them,stepping in to ensure projects stayed on track.I made sure that the rest of the team saw me as the reliable one-the person they could trust to steer the company in the right direction.",1,1747117796.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

Solira Mist is an **automated trading platform** designed to help users trade cryptocurrencies and other assets more efficiently. Think of it like having a smart assistant that watches the markets 24/7 and helps you make informed trading decisions—or in some cases, even makes them for you.

What sets it apart from the dozens of other bots out there is its **clean interface and reliable trade signals**. It uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to analyze market patterns in real time, aiming to boost your chances of profitable trades without you needing to stare at charts all day.

It’s also not just limited to crypto. Solira Mist supports **multiple asset classes**, including forex, commodities, and stocks, which adds versatility for users who want to diversify their strategies.

## Who Created Solira Mist?

The creators of Solira Mist have kept a low profile, which is pretty common in the world of trading bots. From what I could gather, it's developed by a team of **financial tech experts and AI engineers**—similar to the background teams behind platforms like Bitcoin Code and Immediate Edge.

While we don’t have verified names or a corporate bio, the platform does feel like it was built by people who understand both trading and user experience. Unlike some sketchy platforms that seem to be thrown together overnight, Solira Mist shows signs of **thoughtful design** and **solid backend infrastructure**.

## How Does Solira Mist Work?

Solira Mist runs on an **AI-powered algorithm** that scans the markets for trading opportunities. It looks at price trends, news events, and technical signals to predict where the market might go next. Based on these predictions, it can either alert you to make a move or execute trades automatically if you’ve set it up that way.

Here’s a quick breakdown:

- You create an account and deposit funds.
- The platform connects you with a **regulated broker**.
- The AI engine begins analyzing market data in real time.
- It generates trading signals or executes trades based on your settings.
- You monitor or tweak your strategy through the dashboard.

The whole system is designed to be **hands-off**, but you can also switch to manual mode if you prefer more control.

## Solira Mist Pros and Cons

Like every trading platform, Solira Mist has its ups and downs. Here’s what stood out for me:

### ✅ Pros

- **User-friendly interface** – Super clean and easy to navigate.
- **Automated trading** – Great for beginners or busy people.
- **Multiple asset support** – More than just crypto.
- **Custom alerts** – Stay informed without being glued to your screen.
- **Mobile-friendly** – Works well on phones and tablets.

### ❌ Cons

- **Minimum deposit of $250** – Not outrageous, but still a barrier for some.
- **No native mobile app** – It runs via browser, though it’s optimized.
- **Limited transparency about founders** – Would feel more legit with a public team.

## What Devices Can be Used to Access Solira Mist?

Solira Mist is **web-based**, meaning you don’t need to download anything. You can log in through:

- **Desktop computers** (Windows, macOS)
- **Tablets**
- **Mobile phones** (Android and iOS browsers)

I used it on both my laptop and phone, and it worked fine. The mobile version is responsive and doesn’t feel like a stripped-down version of the desktop dashboard.

## Solira Mist – Supported Countries

Solira Mist is available in **most countries**, including the United States, Canada, Australia, the UK, and several EU nations. However, due to **regulatory restrictions**, it may not be accessible in certain regions like:

- North Korea
- Iran
- Some parts of the Middle East
- Certain U.S. states (depending on crypto laws)

Always check their website to confirm if your country is supported before registering.

## Solira Mist – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

Solira Mist’s backbone is its **real-time data processing**. The AI scans thousands of market variables every second, allowing it to suggest trades that are based on current trends—not outdated info. I found the alerts pretty accurate most of the time, especially during high-volatility windows.

### User-Friendly Interface

The dashboard is clean, intuitive, and not cluttered with unnecessary jargon. Even if you’re brand-new to trading, you won't feel overwhelmed. Everything from account settings to trade history is easy to access.

### Mobile Accessibility

While there’s no dedicated mobile app (yet), the site is **mobile-optimized** and works smoothly in both Safari and Chrome on smartphones. I’ve checked trades during coffee breaks with no issues.

### Customizable Alerts

You can set **price alerts, asset-specific notifications,** and even AI strategy triggers. It’s a nice balance of automation and control, especially if you want to be notified before big moves.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Solira Mist isn’t just for crypto. You can also trade:

- Forex
- Commodities
- Stocks

This gives you more flexibility to build a diverse portfolio and hedge your positions—something a lot of newer platforms don’t offer.

## Is Solira Mist a Scam?

Based on what I experienced—and compared to obvious scam platforms—I’d say **Solira Mist is legit**. The site uses **SSL encryption**, partners with regulated brokers, and allows fast withdrawals. That said, always proceed cautiously, and don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose.

It’s worth noting that the platform doesn’t promise guaranteed returns (a red flag for scams), and it gives users **full control** over how automated they want things to be.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Solira Mist?

The **minimum deposit is $250**, which is pretty standard for platforms like this. That deposit goes directly into your trading account and is used to open positions—not hidden in fees.

### Solira Mist Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7 via live chat and email**. I tested it with a couple of questions, and both times I got a response within 10 minutes. They were polite and helpful—not the usual copy-paste responses.

## How do you start trading on Solira Mist?

Getting started is easier than I expected. Here’s a step-by-step:

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the official Solira Mist website and fill in your name, email, and phone number. You’ll get a confirmation link via email to verify your account.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

Once logged in, you’ll be connected with a **partnered broker**. You’ll need to verify your identity with a government-issued ID (KYC compliance). Then, deposit at least $250 via bank card, wire transfer, or crypto.

### Step 3: Start Trading

After funding, you can either:

- Let the AI start trading based on its analysis.
- Set your own parameters and trade manually.
- Use demo mode (if available) to test strategies.

## How to Delete a Solira Mist Account?

To delete your account, contact customer support via chat or email. They’ll verify your identity and process the request. It might take 24–48 hours for full deletion, but I didn’t experience any runarounds.

## The Verdict

Solira Mist honestly surprised me. I’ve tested a lot of trading bots, and most fall short either in usability or results. This one has a good balance of **automation, control, and accessibility**, especially for people who want to trade but don’t have time to monitor charts all day.

It’s not perfect—I'd love a **dedicated mobile app** and more transparency about the creators—but the **trading experience itself is solid**. If you’re already trading or just starting out, and you’re okay with the $250 deposit, it’s definitely worth trying.

Actually, sabog ang train of thought ko ngayon, ma. Kasi sobrang random ng pagbisita ng grief sa'kin. Wala sa timing. Gusto kong umiyak o humagulgol pero nasa office ako, nakaharap sa computer, katabi ko mga katrabaho ko. What do i do?

Before I took my own life in the Pack, holding my daughter’s lifeless body, I did three things.

The first thing I did, I sent the report of my daughter’s death to my mated alpha, who was hosting a birthday party for the son of his first love.

What a joke! My daughter, because she was strong, had to donate blood to his first love’s son, who is physically weaker! Her son isn’t even born in human form!

The second thing I did, I calmly took care of all my daughter’s affairs, then held her ashes and spent the night in the Pack Cemetery.

The third thing I did, I softly sang the birthday song and threw the burning bonding severance papers toward the curtains.

At that moment, my alpha’s phone rang.

“Alpha Alexander, the villa is on fire. Luna Ava was there.”

The wine glass shattered, and Alexander Windsor turned and left. He didn’t even know how he floored the gas pedal to reach the villa.

Looking at the raging fire, it felt like something had pierced in his heart. He tried to mindlink me, but he sensed nothing.

The bond had been severed days ago. I was no longer his Luna, we were strangers now.

The curtains fell, revealing me sitting in front of the birthday cake with my daughter’s ashes in my arms. I smiled at him, just as I did when we first met,

“Goodbye, I hate you. I don’t want to be your Luna anymore.”

“If only everything could start over…”

Before I could finish, the entire house collapsed.

Perhaps it was an illusion before death, but I thought I saw the alpha kneel.

But it didn’t matter anymore, I saw my daughter coming to take me.

“Mom, mom…”

“Smack!”

Under the scorching afternoon sun, the coffee cup fell to the ground, and the shards cut through my skin, making me sober right away.

I opened my eyes, only to find myself kneeling in the center of the hall. I looked around with confusion, finally realizing that

I had been reborn!

Ignoring the astonished gazes of the crowd, I pinched myself in the arm. Pain swept through my body, and tears instantly welled up in my eyes.

""Why are you crying? You're the one who crossed the line! You are a human, why you do that to Alpha Alexander!""

A solemn voice came from the main seat.

I snapped back to reality and met the displeased gaze of Xander Windsor.

I immediately lowered my head, appearing as humble as ever, but my body couldn't stop trembling with excitement.

There were light sneers and constant whispers from the crowd.Unfortunately, I'm not a werewolf, so I can't hear what they're saying.

""So young but so scheming! How dare she drugged alpha Alexander and slept with him! Now everyone knows about it. Apparently, she wanted to force Alexander to bond with her, but now she doesn't dare to admit it. How shameless!""

""She's so brazen. We Windsors wouldn't stoop so low. Her love diary about her secret crush on Alexander is all over the Internet now! Our family paid her university tuition, but look at what she has learned!""

""I told you not to bring just anyone home. This is clearly inviting trouble. I don't know if it's learned or ... inherited.""

With that, a few werewolves cast a sideway glance at my mother Monica Garrett, who stood at the end.

Monica paled at their sarcasm. After glancing at me, she immediately lowered her head. Although she felt humiliated, she dared not talk back.

It was because my identity was too special.",1,1747117376.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1klexzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1klexzj/i_was_once_in_a_relationship_with_a_regular/,"I was once in a relationship with a ""regular, middle-aged family man"" who just did an AMA about me - AMA","Hey Reddit,  
So, my morning coffee just got a lot more interesting. A little birdie (read: my publicist’s intern who *lives* on this site) sent me a link to *that* AMA. To the OP: I’m glad your wife finds our ancient history so entertaining—I guess some stories really do age like fine wine… or maybe that’s just me?  

**Disclaimer:** Out of respect for privacy, I won’t be dropping names or specifics that could turn this into a tabloid headline. But since the cat’s already out of the bag, I’m happy to share *my* side of the story—the glitz, the quirks, and why installing a home theater system can apparently lead to two decades of marital inside jokes.  

Pre-Answers (Because I Know You’ll Ask):
How did we meet? Yes, he installed my home theater. No, he did *not* warn me about the existential crisis of watching *Titanic* in surround sound alone.  
Why did it end? Let’s just say dating a “regular guy” while paparazzi hid in your hedges wasn’t exactly a rom-com. Timing’s a beast.  
Do I regret it? Not a bit. It’s nice to remember a time when my biggest worry was someone judging my DVD collection.  

Current Life Update: For those asking—yes, I’m still acting! Catch me in Fake story this fall. Turns out “resurgences” are way more fun in your 40s.  


**P.S.** To OP’s wife: If you ever want the *real* tea, my DMs are open. 😉  ",7,1747117171.0,AMA,20,0.6,False

1klewtp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ascaso/comments/1klewtp/new_everything_best_starting_setup_of_ascaso/,New everything. Best starting setup of Ascaso Steel Duo PID Plus?,"My coffee equipment started to come in. I want to brew classic Italian style espressos so i did a lot of research and this is what i got to start with. What i'm asking is, what would be the starting setup of the machine? I wrote everything down and i'll keep you posted how's it going. 

Equipment:

\- Ascaso Steel Duo PID Plus ( i got it on sale for 1.500 eur, i think it was a very good price)  
  Bottomless portafilter was included.  
\- Grinder Niche Zero  
\- I plan to use Espresso parts ridgeless baskets (14g and 21g). I'll fill them around 14g to 15g the small one,       and 18g bigger one if needed). I've read many good things about these baskets for Medium/dark roast   Italian style espressos.   
\- Scale that is way too big (i don't know what i was thinking)  
\- Some Normcore products (V4.1 tamper, WDT,..)  
\- Puqpress mini is also coming (shoulder injuries and improved consistency)  
\- I have two different freshly roasted beans incoming. One is Torrefazione Mocaflor Gold blend (80% Arabica, 20% Robusta). The other is Saka GranBar.   
\- i plan to distribute beans into single dosing jars, freeze them and use them directly from the freezer.

Now questions:

How to setup Ascaso properly from the start?

My plan:

PID set to 90C (medium/dark roast) and offset set to 7C (i've read and viewed many videos and looks like this must be done)?

Preinfusion 0 - 0? Looks like most use preinfusion on light roasts, but not so much on medium roasts. Is that ok or should i use some preinfusion?

I have no idea how to use Ascaso volumetric system do i'll probably just let it run and stop by time/scale.

I plan to dose 14g or 15g coffee into 14g size basket (EspressoParts 14 basket is big) and try 1:2 or 1:3 ratio in 30s. 

Anything i should change or is this in the ballpark?",5,1747117039.0,Ascaso,1,1.0,False
