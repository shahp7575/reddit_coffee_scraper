-----------------------------------------------------------------

Deciding on the right shampoo for your furry friend can feel like navigating a minefield. With so many brands vying for your attention, it's easy to get lost in a sea of promises. One brand that often pops up on pet store shelves is Hartz. But is Hartz shampoo good for dogs? That's the million-dollar question, and one we'll be tackling head-on in this comprehensive guide. We'll delve into the ingredients, weigh the pros and cons, explore user experiences, and ultimately, help you determine if Hartz is the right choice for your canine companion. So, grab a cup of coffee, settle in, and let's unravel the Hartz shampoo mystery!

### Decoding the Hartz Formula: What's Inside the Bottle?

Before slathering any product on your beloved pooch, it's crucial to understand what exactly it contains. A shampoo's ingredients can make or break its effectiveness, and even pose potential risks. So, let's roll up our sleeves and dissect the typical Hartz shampoo formula, looking for both the heroes and the villains.

- **Common Ingredients:** Often, you'll find ingredients like pyrethrins, permethrin, or other insecticides in Hartz flea and tick shampoos. These are designed to kill pesky parasites, but can be irritating for some dogs. You'll also encounter detergents, fragrances, and conditioners.
- **Potential Irritants:** Some Hartz formulas contain ingredients that have been flagged as potential irritants, particularly for sensitive-skinned pups. These can include certain dyes, fragrances, and even some of the detergents.
- **The ""Natural"" Debate:** Some Hartz products are marketed as ""natural,"" but it's crucial to scrutinize the ingredient list. ""Natural"" doesn't always mean safe or effective.

### Is Hartz Shampoo Good for Dogs? Weighing the Pros and Cons

Like any product, Hartz shampoo has its upsides and downsides. Let's put it on the scales and see which side tips the balance.

**Pros:**

1. **Affordability:** Hartz shampoos are generally quite budget-friendly, making them an attractive option for pet owners on a tighter leash financially.
2. **Accessibility:** You can find Hartz products in just about any pet store, grocery store, and even online. Talk about convenient!
3. **Variety:** Hartz offers a wide range of shampoos targeting different needs, from flea and tick control to deodorizing and even specialized formulas for puppies.

**Cons:**

1. **Potential for Irritation:** As we discussed earlier, certain ingredients in some Hartz formulas have been linked to skin irritation in some dogs.
2. **Effectiveness Concerns:** Some pet owners have reported that Hartz shampoos aren't as effective as other brands, particularly when it comes to flea and tick control. This might lead you to re-apply more often, negating the cost-effectiveness.
3. **Strong Fragrance:** While some people enjoy the scent of Hartz shampoos, others find it overpowering, and it could be irritating for dogs with sensitive noses.

### User Experiences: What Are Pet Owners Saying?

While understanding the ingredients and weighing the pros and cons is essential, hearing from other pet owners can provide valuable real-world insights. After all, who better to judge a dog shampoo than those who've used it on their furry family members?

- **Positive Reviews:** Some pet owners swear by Hartz shampoos, praising their affordability and effectiveness, particularly for routine bathing and odor control. They find it gets the job done without breaking the bank.
- **Negative Reviews:** However, other pet owners have shared less-than-stellar experiences. Some report skin irritation, allergic reactions, and even ineffectiveness against fleas and ticks.
- **The Mixed Bag:** It's clear that experiences with Hartz shampoo vary widely. This highlights the importance of carefully considering your dog's individual needs and sensitivities.

Is Hartz Shampoo Good for Dogs? Considering Your Dog's Specific Needs
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Is your dog prone to dry skin? Does he have allergies? Is he a puppy with delicate skin? Answering these questions can help you determine if Hartz is the right fit. A husky with a thick double coat might tolerate a harsher formula, while a chihuahua with sensitive skin might require something gentler.

### Alternatives to Hartz: Exploring Other Options

If you're hesitant about using Hartz, don't worry! Plenty of other dog shampoos are available, catering to various needs and budgets. Consider exploring brands like:

1. **Veterinary Formulated Shampoos:** Often recommended for dogs with specific skin conditions.
2. **Oatmeal-Based Shampoos:** Known for their soothing properties, ideal for sensitive skin.
3. **Hypoallergenic Shampoos:** Formulated to minimize the risk of allergic reactions.

Is Hartz Shampoo Good for Dogs? The Final Verdict
-------------------------------------------------

So, where do we land on the big question: Is Hartz shampoo good for dogs? The truth is, there's no one-size-fits-all answer. While Hartz offers affordable and readily available options, the potential for irritation and varying effectiveness raises concerns. Ultimately, the best approach is to carefully consider your dog's individual needs, read reviews diligently, and consult your veterinarian if you're unsure. They can offer personalized recommendations based on your dog's breed, age, and health.

### Tips for Safe Shampooing: Making Bath Time a Breeze

Regardless of which shampoo you choose, here are some tips to make bath time a positive experience for both you and your dog:

- **Lukewarm Water:** Avoid hot water, which can dry out your dog's skin.
- **Thorough Rinsing:** Make sure to rinse all traces of shampoo to prevent irritation.
- **Positive Reinforcement:** Lots of praise and treats can make bath time less stressful.

Beyond the Shampoo: A Holistic Approach to Dog Health
-----------------------------------------------------

Remember, shampoo is just one piece of the puzzle. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and routine vet checkups are crucial for your dog's overall well-being. Just like us, dogs thrive when we prioritize their health from the inside out. So, while finding the right shampoo is important, remember that it's part of a larger picture.

1hl8w8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror_house/comments/1hl8w8c/the_mirror_never_lies/,The Mirror Never Lies,"It wasn’t my first choice of decoration.

I’d found the mirror at a flea market—a tall, ornate thing with a tarnished gold frame and an unsettlingly pristine surface. The vendor had practically thrown it at me for ten bucks. “Old thing,” he said with a shrug, refusing to meet my eyes. “Might not like what it shows.”

I laughed it off and hung it in my bedroom. It was too big for the space, but something about it felt… important.

By the second night, I wished I’d left it where it was.

# Day One

The first time I noticed something strange was while brushing my hair. The mirror reflected me perfectly—until it didn’t.

There was a flicker, so quick I almost missed it. My reflection… blinked. But I hadn’t.

I leaned closer, staring into the glass. Everything looked normal, but my gut churned with unease. I told myself I was imagining things and went to bed.

That night, I woke up gasping for air. My room was icy cold, and the mirror seemed to glow faintly in the darkness.

I swore I heard a whisper.

# Day Two

The whispers grew louder.

It started while I was getting ready for work. A faint, raspy voice hummed from the mirror, just barely audible.

At first, I thought it was coming from the hallway or maybe my phone. But when I moved closer, the voice stopped.

“Hello?” I whispered, feeling ridiculous.

The mirror didn’t respond.

By the time I got home, I was jumpy, every creak of my old apartment setting me on edge. I avoided looking at the mirror as I undressed, but I could feel it. Watching.

That night, I woke to the sound of my own voice.

It was coming from the mirror.

# Day Three

I was exhausted, running on coffee and denial. I tried covering the mirror with a blanket, but it fell off within minutes, as if the glass rejected it.

The voice spoke again while I was brushing my teeth. It wasn’t a whisper this time. It was clear, sharp, and cruel.

**“You can’t hide from me.”**

I froze, toothbrush trembling in my hand. The reflection wasn’t mine anymore. The thing in the mirror looked like me—same face, same clothes—but the eyes… God, the eyes. They were pitch black.

It smiled, and my stomach turned.

I ran out of the bathroom and didn’t go back until morning.

# Day Four

I decided to get rid of the mirror. I wrapped it in a sheet and dragged it to the dumpster behind my building.

But when I returned to my apartment, it was there—hanging on the wall, right where it had been.

My phone buzzed with a notification. A photo.

It was me, standing in front of the mirror, but my reflection wasn’t there.

# Day Five

The mirror’s voice became constant—a low, mocking commentary that filled the silence.

“You think you’re real?” it sneered. “Do you know how many of you there have been?”

I smashed it. Grabbed a hammer and shattered the glass into a million shards.

For a moment, the silence was deafening.

Then I saw them—the reflections, dozens of them, trapped in each shard of broken glass. All of them me, all of them screaming.

The voice returned, laughing.

“You can’t destroy me,” it hissed. “I *am* you.”

I haven’t slept since. The shards are gone, but every reflective surface—the windows, the bathroom mirror, even the water in my sink—shows *it*.

It smiles with my face, its black eyes unblinking.

And it’s waiting.",1,1735027082.0,horror_house,0,1.0,False

# 2. Living Room: A Showcase of Style

The living room is often the focal point of a home, so decorative accessories here should make a strong impression.

# Key Accessories:

* **Pouf Seating**: Add stylish poufs to create additional seating or a footrest option. Choose textured fabrics or bold colors to make them stand out.
* **Ceramic Vases**: Place a collection of vases on a coffee table, shelf, or mantel. Opt for varying heights and finishes to create a dynamic arrangement.

Your bedroom should be a cozy retreat, and accessories here should enhance relaxation.

* **Pouf Seating**: Use a pouf at the foot of the bed or in a corner for a cozy reading nook.
* **Ceramic Vases**: Add a small vase with fresh flowers or dried pampas grass to your nightstand for a touch of elegance.

# 4. Dining Room: Functional Elegance

Decorative accessories in the dining room should strike a balance between practicality and beauty.

# Key Accessories:

* **Ceramic Vases**: Use a tall vase as a centerpiece on your dining table. A neutral or earthy-toned vase filled with greenery or flowers can make a sophisticated statement.
* **Wall Hanging**: Install a large decorative mirror or an abstract wall hanging to add depth and character to the space.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth bleaching has become a popular cosmetic dentistry trend, helping many people achieve a brighter smile. However, with this popularity comes concern about the potential impact on enamel health. One of the most common questions arises: does bleaching teeth damage enamel? This article clears the air regarding the myths and facts surrounding teeth bleaching and enamel health.

### The Science Behind Enamel

To fully understand how bleaching affects your teeth, you first need to know about enamel. Enamel is the outermost layer of your teeth, composed mostly of minerals. It is the hardest substance in the body and helps to protect your teeth from decay and sensitivity. However, when enamel is compromised, it can lead to various dental issues.

### Myths About Teeth Bleaching and Enamel Damage

There are several myths surrounding the effects of teeth bleaching on enamel. It's crucial to differentiate between these myths and the actual facts.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Myth 1:** All whitening products damage enamel.   
     Fact: Not all products are created equal. Professional treatments are designed to minimize enamel harm, while over-the-counter products may be less effective.
- **Myth 2:** You should avoid bleaching if you have sensitive teeth.   
     Fact: Sensitivity can occur, but many professional whitening treatments offer desensitizing options.
- **Myth 3:** Once you bleach, you cannot ever do it again.   
     Fact: You can have repeated treatments, but it's advisable to wait for a certain period to allow enamel recovery.

### Facts About Teeth Bleaching and Enamel Health

Now that we’ve discussed the myths, let’s delve into the actual facts about the impact of teeth bleaching on enamel.

- **Fact 1:** Professional treatments are safer.   
     Dentists use effective concentrations of hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide that are less likely to harm enamel than DIY methods.
- **Fact 2:** Enamel can remineralize after bleaching.   
     Post-treatment fluoride applications can help strengthen enamel and reduce potential risks.
- **Fact 3:** Overuse can lead to issues.   
     Frequent bleaching without proper care can wear down enamel over time. Moderation is key.

### Understanding Enamel Erosion

Enamel erosion can be caused by various factors beyond just teeth whitening. Acidic foods, beverages, and poor oral hygiene can greatly impact enamel health. Consequently, it’s crucial to consider overall dental care alongside any bleaching regimen.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Practical Tips for Safe Teeth Bleaching

If you're considering teeth bleaching, here are some practical tips to help ensure you maintain enamel health:

1. **Consult a Professional:** Always consult with your dentist before starting any bleaching treatment to ensure it’s suitable for you.
2. **Choose Quality Products:** Opt for professionally administered treatments or reputable brands if using over-the-counter products.
3. **Monitor Frequency:** Spacing out bleaching treatments will allow your enamel time to recover.
4. **Stay Hydrated:** Drinking water post-treatment can help wash away any residual bleaching agents and keep your mouth hydrated.
5. **Practice Good Oral Hygiene:** Brushing with fluoride toothpaste twice a day and flossing can help protect enamel.

### Aftercare for Bleached Teeth

After undergoing teeth bleaching, it’s essential to take proper care of your enamel:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Fluoride Treatments:** Ask your dentist about fluoride treatments to help strengthen enamel.
- **Avoid Staining Foods:** For at least 48 hours post-bleaching, stay away from coffee, red wine, and other staining foods and drinks.
- **Regular Dental Checkups:** Make sure to visit your dentist regularly to monitor your enamel health and address any concerns early on.

Teeth bleaching doesn't necessarily damage enamel when done correctly and responsibly. By choosing professional treatments and following appropriate aftercare, you can enjoy a brighter smile without compromising your oral health. Remember, your dental care should always focus on your unique needs and overall health.

Safe Practices for Whitening Your Teeth Without Damaging Enamel
---------------------------------------------------------------

Whitening your teeth can give you a brighter smile, but it’s important to consider the health of your enamel. Enamel is the hard outer layer that protects your teeth. If damaged, it can lead to sensitivity and other dental issues. Here are some safe practices to help you achieve whiter teeth while protecting your enamel.

### Understand Your Options

Various teeth whitening methods are available, each with its pros and cons. Knowing the differences can help you choose the best option for your needs. Here are some common methods:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** This is a gentle way to brighten your teeth. These toothpastes contain mild abrasives and may have chemical agents aimed at removing stains.
- **Over-the-Counter Whitening Kits:** Products like strips or trays can be effective. However, read the instructions carefully to avoid using them too frequently.
- **Professional Whitening Treatments:** A dentist can provide stronger whitening treatments. They can also ensure your enamel stays safe during the process.

### Choose the Right Products

Not all whitening products are created equal. Here are a few tips on how to choose the best ones:

- **Look for ADA Seal:** The American Dental Association (ADA) has a seal of acceptance for safe whitening products. This guarantees that they meet safety standards.
- **Avoid Harsh Chemicals:** Some whitening products contain high levels of hydrogen peroxide. Too much can harm your enamel, so opt for milder options.
- **Check Ingredients:** Aim for products that contain fluoride. Fluoride can help to strengthen enamel, reducing the risk of damage.

### Follow the Instructions

No matter which whitening product you choose, always follow the manufacturer’s instructions. Using a product more often than recommended can lead to enamel wear. Here are some guidelines on the importance of proper use:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Use as Directed:** Stick to the application times suggested on the packaging.
- **Don’t Overuse:** Give your teeth breaks between whitening sessions to help maintain enamel integrity.
- **Monitor Your Teeth:** If you notice increased sensitivity or discomfort, stop using the product and consult a dentist.

### Consider Natural Remedies

If you prefer a gentler approach, some natural remedies can help whiten your teeth without damaging enamel. Here are a few options:

- **Baking Soda:** Mixing baking soda with water can create a paste that helps remove surface stains. Limit this to once or twice a week.
- **Strawberries:** The malic acid in strawberries may help brighten your teeth. You can mash a few and apply them for a few minutes before rinsing.
- **Coconut Oil Pulling:** Swishing coconut oil in your mouth can reduce plaque and potentially whiten teeth over time.

### Maintain Good Oral Hygiene

Preventing stains in the first place is always better than fixing them later. Adopting a solid oral hygiene routine is essential for maintaining white teeth and healthy enamel. Here are some tips:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Brush and Floss Regularly:** Brush twice a day and floss daily to remove food particles and plaque.
- **Use a Soft-Bristled Toothbrush:** This will help reduce enamel wear while cleaning your teeth effectively.
- **Limit Stain-Causing Foods and Drinks:** Beverages like coffee, tea, and red wine can contribute to stains. If you enjoy these, consider rinsing your mouth with water afterward.

### Consult Your Dentist

Before starting any whitening treatment, it's wise to consult your dentist. A professional can evaluate your oral health and recommend safe options tailored to your specific needs. This step is crucial in ensuring your enamel remains intact while achieving that sparkling smile you desire. Remember, your dental health should always come first. A bright smile can be beautiful, but a healthy one is essential.

Whitening your teeth doesn't have to harm your enamel. By choosing the right products, following instructions, and maintaining proper oral hygiene, you can safely brighten your smile. Always prioritize your dental health and consult a dentist for guidance.

### Conclusion

Understanding the relationship between teeth bleaching and enamel health is crucial for anyone considering whitening options. Myths about teeth whitening can lead to unnecessary fears, but it’s essential to differentiate between fact and fiction. Many people worry that bleaching will weaken their enamel, yet scientific studies indicate that when done correctly, bleaching products can be safe and effective. It's vital to choose reputable whitening methods and to follow the instructions carefully to maintain your enamel health.

For safe practices, you can consider consulting with a dentist who can provide personalized advice and professional treatments. Over-the-counter whitening products can also be a good option, but be mindful of their ingredient concentrations. Adopting a responsible approach—like avoiding excessive use and combining treatments with good oral hygiene—can help protect your enamel while achieving a brighter smile.

As you explore your teeth whitening options, stay informed about both the benefits and potential risks. Taking proactive steps, such as using desensitizing toothpaste or enjoying a break between treatments, can help safeguard your enamel against any adverse effects. Ultimately, achieving a beautiful smile shouldn’t come at the cost of your dental health, and understanding how to whiten your teeth safely can lead to satisfying results. Prioritizing enamel health while enjoying the confidence of whiter teeth can lead to a brighter, healthier future for your smile.

He's been living alone for a few months, and I was talking about where I could put my dogs cage and my cats litterbox, and it seemed like he wants me to keep everything i own in my room. I have a whole apartment worth of furniture and just general house things. The bedroom I'm going to be staying in is smaller than my current one, and while I can fit a decent amount of my furniture like my coffee table and bed and TV stand in it, I have a few things that just won't fit like my dogs cage and a chair and a rug. I figured we could find a place for my things but when we were talking about it he noped every suggestion of mine. I get he feels like its his space, but it's about to be our space. How do I bring up compromising on shared space? I can't have an XL dog cage and litter box and a whole living room in my tiny bed room, and I'm already sacrificing the furniture I don't have sentimental value in or every day use for.

Last night’s run was fantastic—left knee pain is subsiding, so I need to keep training. 

Break goals into smaller, manageable tasks. Reading papers and editing documents causes tension, and avoiding headaches is important.

Use music like Baby Driver to drown out negative thoughts. It’s tough, but posting on Reddit helps reroute my mind to positive thoughts. Tension signals it’s time for a break; breaks help ease the tension.

Feeling a bit drowsy in the chair right now, but it's just a temporary setback. I tried to cheer myself up and get some work done, but it's okay if today isn't going perfectly. Just had my break, and it's alright if I'm not at my best all the time. Positive self-talks might not work instantly, but they still matter.

Breaking goals into manageable bits—like reading one page at a time—is a good strategy. Maybe my energy levels are low after lunch, but that’s normal. It’s not about what i did in the morning; it’s about how I tackle tasks now. Sometimes, fear of tedium and failure can automatically shut down my mind, but I can overcome it. A coffee or a cup of tea might be just what I need to re-energize. or maybe a brisk walk.

at least i'm not watching porn now. i couldn't even do this - positive self talk and thinking how to figure things out, when i'm watching porn.

just do something, anything, instead of lying here drenched in fear. go get a coffee, go have a walk, come back later.

ok out at a coffee shop. what would tim fxxking ferriss do? Focus in strengths , dont fix weaknesses. i am good and am surviving by getting ppl to do the ground work for me, maybe that kind of work is boring to me but interesting and structural to them.

maybe fear of tedium is a form of fear of failure.

maybe just focus and do the analytical and strategising work , just do that and forget about getting the rest perfect, just do ok for all other parts. Really i’m putting too much expectations on myself.

learn to always hype myself up, like now, always find an angle for me to look forward to working, instead of fxxking enduring work, it’s not working anyway.

and at least i’m not running away now by watching porn. At least i’m thinking how to get out of this fxxking mess. Strategise and face the fears head on, instead of running away.",2,1735026077.0,Diary,0,1.0,False

His first question is about coffee and he doesn't like my offer of k-cups for the keurig in his room. Then he asked me about the day's high temperature and I tell him I don't know but probably cold because it's December in North America.

This leads to a rant about how hotels used to have 24 hours coffee in the lobby, daily newspapers, and would post the days weather at the front desk. He continues his old white guy lament about how everything costs more now and you keep getting less. Then there's this weird turn to how everything is paperless and it's ruining his business because he's in paper. He goes on this weird Alex Jones like rant about how everyone is out to destroy the paper industry that ends with quiet muttering to himself.

Then completely unprompted he blurts out ""I'M LIKE GEORGE FLOYD OVER HERE!""

I asked him what he meant by that because he couldn't have just really said that right? Maybe he's thinking of someone else? Got names confused because it's not even 6am and this guy hasn't had his coffee yet?

1hl8mw1,https://www.reddit.com/r/bangalore/comments/1hl8mw1/what_unique_business_could_thrive_on_st_johns/,What Unique Business Could Thrive on St. John’s Road? Seeking Ideas!,"Hi all,

I’m considering leasing a small ground-floor corner space on **St. John’s Road** and am brainstorming ideas for a unique business that could stand out in the area. Here’s the context:

The space is on a visible corner with a wide sidewalk, (very) limited parking, and steady foot and vehicle traffic, especially during rush hours as it's close to a stoplight. There’s a **lake with a walking trail** nearby, drawing walkers, joggers, and cyclists.

It’s a small space—ideal for quick service or takeaway-focused businesses, with seating for about 5-10 people max. I am wondering whether seating even makes sense in these days of app-based services. 

The area has a mix of budget-friendly fast-food spots - 3-4 dosa joints and a couple of (bad) coffee shops, so I’m looking to introduce something distinct and exciting to fill a gap. I also intend to make the coffee scene better for sure by adding a coffee counter (something like a pick-n-go)

While researching  on food trends, here are some 10 concepts I’ve been shortlisted that I think could stand out in the area:

1. **Fresh Fruit Yogurt Bar** – Think customizable parfaits with fresh fruit, granola, and gourmet toppings.
2. **Parozza** – A fusion concept offering tacos alongside a unique take on pizza (paratha meets pizza).
3. **Ice Cream Sandwich Bar** – Pairing soft-serve or gelato with innovative sandwich bases like cookies, brownies, or brioche.
4. **Stick Waffles** – Belgian waffles served on sticks with a variety of dips and toppings.
5. **Hot Dogs, Sausages, and Pretzels** with gourmet twists on toppings. Imagine Pretzel wrapped sausages. 
6. **Coffee, Smoothies, Boba, and (maybe) Artisanal Teas** – A beverage-forward spot catering to both caffeine and health-conscious crowds. The place truly needs decent high-end coffee from what I see currently.
7. **Sandwiches and Rolls -** think Vietnamese Summer Rolls, Banh Mi, Kaya Toast, Panini, Subway-type fare, Shawarma Wraps and Falafel
8. **Empanadas and Hand Pies** – Portable, savory or sweet snacks.
9. **Poffertjes and Churros** – Bite-sized Dutch pancakes or Spanish churros.
10. **Seasonal Fruit Coolers** – Refreshing drinks featuring fresh, local fruits. There is a juice shop nearby but that's a tad low-end/generic. 

I’m intentionally looking to avoid ideas that are already saturated in the market (like generic fast food, dosas or common coffee shop chains). Instead, I want to create something specific and memorable—ideally with a mix of quick service and grab-and-go options.

Importantly, I am thinking about 3-4  counters that compliment each other or use similar equipment and inventory - e.g. waffles and icecream, or premium egg rolls and tacos. This way I could potentially serve a larger crowd. 

**Would love your input**:

* What concepts from this list do you think could perform well on St. John’s Road?
* Are there any other unique business ideas you’d recommend?
* If you’re familiar with the area, what’s missing in the current food scene?

I’m excited to hear your thoughts and refine this concept. Thanks in advance for your help! 😊",2,1735025954.0,bangalore,3,1.0,False
1hl8mr9,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGaming/comments/1hl8mr9/time_to_turn_my_life_around/,Time to turn my life around,"FUCK I want to rip my hair out. I don’t even know exactly where to start with my story but let’s just start from the beginning. 

I grew up playing young, very young, and using it as a way of escapism. I had a slightly rough childhood with an alcoholic parent, and sometimes it was just way easier to sink my life into that at home because my dad would be working and non existent around the house and my mom would be past out and what kid would want to deal with that more than I already had to?

My video gaming as a kid, well I can’t blame that on myself. I was actually pretty healthy, playing sports, and finding escapism there too. I’d spend countless hours at home playing when I’d have my free time (after making sure to be clean, take care of myself, practice sports). I feel it started to take a turn when I become a junior / senior in high school, as I got my first gaming pc. It was truly amazing how much you could do with gaming on a PC and how much of a variety you could have at your fingertips. PUBG and Fortnite rolled out around these times and I started sinking hours and hours and hours into these games. 

I took fortnite to the next level. I played all day everyday outside of school, even letting it get in the way of my sleep countless COUNTLESS times, having to wake up the next day for school. I’d get constantly 4 or less hours of sleep and then the next day do it all over again. I’d come home and between practicing sports or hanging out with friends, all id do was game. I didn’t have other hobbies and didn’t spend any time with my family much (this was the worst stint of my moms alcoholism). 

I got pretty good at fortnite, and hitting top 500 in the world. I was so proud of myself, and still I was a multi sport athlete, good at my sports, and doing good in school (enough to get a scholarship). I had a job and outside of the activities I’d be responsible for, I’d find any time to game.

Going into college, i had a girlfriend, I also was a collegiate athlete. So I was doing college, my college sport, and video gaming. Again I’d spend countless hours a day (at least 4-6) or whatever time I’d find in between to game. Essentially if I didn’t have a responsibility to tend to I’d game. I realized through my sophomore year that playing 7+ hours a day was exhausting to keep up with the grind of fortnite and pros, and that I’d like to focus on soccer because it was my true happiness and I quit playing “professionally”. However this didn’t keep me from playing. I started to branch, playing other games like Rocket League, League of Legends (a game I started when I was 13), other popular hit multiplayer games that I’d play with my friends. I started to variety game instead of drain myself into one game. 

Now to wrap back around to the girlfriend, I didn’t see AT all how much this was affecting our relationship. in the first two years it was pretty unapparent to me. Yes I’d spend a lot of time with her when she’d come and visit and be around but sometimes I’d find myself gaming late nights when she was there, leaving her to sleep alone, and her dreading the next day because of my loathsome self waking up past noon or later.

So through a couple more years of college I’d continue gaming and increasingly the dynamic of our relationship grew worse, because of gaming. We would fight a lot, about different things, relationship things. But I feel the root of the irritation, anger, resentment that stemmed from my girlfriend was because of my addictive gaming. 

So we grew to resent, to be irritated alot with each other. It changed the dynamic of our relationship entirely. Sure there were many goods but many downs because of late night gaming. We had our fights and figured things out then. But I didn’t fully see this causation before. (I feel I say this because often times she was agitated, mean, and relentless toward me with her feelings) I’d feel she didn’t take the time to think about things, about how she said them to me or how she treated me, etc. 

We both had our problems, and our ways of communicating our feelings I’d say. It wasn’t very clear to me in college what was going on i guess. 

Now, I’ve grown, 3 years from school. I’ve been graduated for almost three fucking years. And I continue to let this shit rain down on us and me and my life. and it’s tearing me up.

I mean, year 1 after school I moved back in with my mom and found myself gaming away when I had free time in my life. I’d push most things aside and continue this unhealthy lifestyle of waking up extremely late and having no day to do anything and gaming away my life again yet another fucking day man. 

I went from once a casual gamer healthy lifestyle full of friends in highschool to being an introverted (even though I’m not) closet gamer. And the worst part is that all aspects of my life I am doing good. Like I have a great job, a stable income, I’m healthy, I haven’t lost any loved ones, I never stepped into drugs (obviously because of my mom) and I’m letting this thing rip away all aspects of my life. I’m letting it eat up all my time, I’m letting it get in the way of my relationship (the perfect person I’d absolutely die for). And yes I was dealing with something’s at the time like my mom still drinking and that rough part of my life that opens up the childhood sore. Id game to forget she was past out drinking yet again and again and again. And no this is not an excuse just a telling of my story. 

I hit rock bottom dealing with my mom and I fully left the state, (as I could with my income). I left and fully supported my girlfriend and I and moved to a new city where she recently told me she thought everything would be better and we’d be such a perfect relationship and then…

I keep fucking it up. Any time we’d fight, or we’d have a bad moment, I’d turtle into gaming. And I’d use this as a crutch to get away from our relationship. I did it so much that some days we’d see each other and I’d be so upset with something and use it as a way of “silent treatment” punishment to defend myself from further harm between us. I didn’t figure out how far I was really just pushing us apart, again and again. And I fucking regret every time I turned on my pc and ignored the love of my life, because this addiction could help drown the struggles of life. I feel this was the worst period of my addiction, where I fully succumbed to DAYS and DAYS of straight waking up, GAMING, not giving a single fuck about my health, my relationship, just getting through the next day, getting through the next day. And at this point i still wasn’t smoking (this happens later on)

Somehow we get through this. I mean it was really hard. Some days felt like the end of our relationship. And the worst part of that is that I didn’t see any part of my side being the problem (obviously I knew she had a problem with my gaming, but I would say “well if you treated me better than I would have no reason to drown myself”). I can see how manipulative this could be because I’m not thoroughly communicating the way that I feel and instead silencing those feelings and gaming. (Truly sometimes I felt hopeless and this would just send me into the absolute abyss of gaming). For some time I felt I was depressed as well, having thoughts about losing my girlfriend and I’m already a fucking bum loser doing nothing with my life everyday gaming. It’s just truly amazing how blind you can really be sometimes. On a side note: I also was not doing the best with work, putting it aside and sometimes missing shifts, work, calling off. And I have an amazing job that I know other people would kill for and I’m just doing these very STUPID things that could possibly jeopardize it. End of year 1

We moved states again after our first lease, into a new city for work. And again only after a short amount of time I found myself up late gaming, ignoring the wants of my girlfriend (wanting to having a routine, wanting to show up more everyday). I’d hardly go to sleep with her and I’d stay up casually till 4 am whether I had to work or not, destroying my energy for the next day. I wouldn’t want to do anything but the bare minimum of working, eating, hanging out sometimes, and then gaming as much as I could. 

I found myself in bad health (which is something I really despise). I stopped being healthy (working out, eating good, taking care of myself) and I began to smoke a ton. It made gaming MORE fun. And now I have two addictions, smoking and gaming, fucking awesome. I’d continue this until I sent myself to the fucking hospital for health reasons called CHS (if you’re curious look it up). Obviously this put a huge halt on my life. I was extremely sick, deathly sick for 2 weeks and I hated everything that I had did. I hated that I let smoking get that crazy and the extremeness of my gaming leading to my body becoming skinner and skinnier and I have become a fucking twig when I used to be AN ATHLETE. I hardly recognized myself at this point in my life. And yes my girlfriend and I were still struggling with these problems, my habits worsening, our fights worsening, the irritation, anger growing. We had the worst fights we have ever had. And I still look back and just hurt so much from these fights. 

Now 7 months later. I really still find myself in the same fucking spot. I’m still addictively gaming, smoking when I game (which is dangerous for me to do, even though I think I’m okay now, it can’t be healthy right? All I do is eat junk food, sit and play games, my body is just rotting every fucking day.) And I’m finally done with it. Truly this shit is getting ridiculous and I just can’t believe I’ve let it come this far. I’ve let it come so far in between my relationship, so far into my life, it’s completely taken over. I am hardly motivated, hardly goal driven, just getting by everyday because i landed a good job and as long as I coast then I’m doing just fine. Really before I came home for the holidays, i gamed hard. And I thought even harder. I thought do I really want to do this for the rest of my life? When will this end? Because yesterday I said today, and the day before that I said that too. When the fuck am i going to stop letting this shit run my life? And the answer is fuck you gaming, I won’t let you do this to me anymore. As much as I loved you, you are killing me now. You are killing my life, and destroying others as well. I’m tired of being unreliable for weekend dates, getting to go get a fucking coffee. The bare minimum. I’m just so embarrassed to even come to this conclusion, that this is me and this is real and this is who I have been. 

I’m putting an end to it, the addiction of gaming and to do that I’m limiting myself everyday. To an absolute maximum of three hours a day. I can do so much in a three hour span of gaming and there is no fucking need for me to spend anymore time than this to enjoy one or multiple games. And I will be trying to push myself to spend less time a day but if all of my responsibilities are met and I’m not spending time with my girlfriend working on what I’ve broken, then that’s the absolute max I can give myself comfortably. And lastly I won’t stay up past 2:00 AM on weekends anymore, weekday playing games. There is no reason to ever stay up past this time playing anymore. It fucks my sleep, it fucks the next day, and every single time I find myself gaming at this hour I feel DEPRESSED. Sitting there thinking wtf am I doing with my life man. Honestly I have rampant thoughts in the late hours of the night and a lot of them are about my relationship, what I have been doing with my life, how unhealthy I am. Sometimes I’d just look in the mirror at myself and cry because of how embarrassed I am to look at myself knowing this is what I’ve become.

So Reddit please hold me accountable. Please give me encouragement, any words of advice. But I have wanted to do this for a long time, I’ve needed to do this for a long time, and I’ve needed to hold myself accountable for my own sake. 

I’ll be learning guitar, spending more time with my girlfriend, getting back into a healthy routine of working out, cooking healthy meals to get those gains, and bettering my life. 

I hope anyone who sees this knows that it isn’t ever too late. You aren’t a failure, you are only a product of your own destruction. But the best foundations come from a cleared, open field. Start fresh, start motivated, and push yourself. Don’t let gaming drown your life. There is more to life out there and as I start my journey onto learning this, you can too.

I care for them and their family and I give all that I can. I cook for him, I clean for his family, I buy more gifts than I get in return. I do love him, but I feel so used at times. 

We are lucky enough to live with our parents while completing higher academics, however, I pay for a majority of my things through savings and on and off work that I do (substitute teaching, catering). He has 2 parents that care for him. He constantly asks me to buy things to cook for him, like fancy cakes, fancy steak meals, things that cost a lot of money but also require a lot of my time. 

This Christmas, I bought him 3 really nice things, and a 4th thing that I thought he would like. Overall, I spent 170$. I cooked him 2 really expensive dinners, and I bought ingredients for 2 desserts that he said he wanted. I cooked them at 6am because he wants me to come over as soon as I wake up at 9:30-10:00am. 

He bought me 2 things for the holiday, a cheap perfume and a clothing item. He got them from TJ max. He didn’t put any thought into what I actually want, what I’ve said I actually wanted. He stuck to the last 4 years. The same 2 gifts over and over. 

I don’t want to sound ungrateful because I am so thankful. But, I am not getting anything. I give and I give my time, my work, my money. I clean his fucking dishes, I cook meals for him, I buy him things I hope he’ll like. 

As a cherry on top, from the things I got for him this holiday, he wants to return something because “it’ll save me money”. Who the fuck says that? 

He has more money than I have in my savings in his bank account, and he won’t even pay for my coffee from Starbucks. I have to Zelle it to him.

Just because you’re transported to another world, doesn’t mean you’ll escape from your pain.

Abused by her parents, thirteen-year-old Frances only wants to be safe and for her life not to hurt so much. And when she and her class are transported to the magical world of Durannon to fight the monsters invading the human kingdoms and defeat the self-titled Demon King, Frances is presented with a golden opportunity. If she succeeds, Frances will have the home she never had. If she fails, Frances will be summoned back to the home she escaped.

Yet, despite her newfound magic and friends, Frances finds that trauma is not so easily lost. She is dogged by her abuse and its physical and invisible scars. Not only does she have to learn magic, she has to survive the nightmares of her past, and wrestle with her feelings of doubt and self-loathing.

If she can heal from her trauma, though, she might be able to defeat the Demon King and maybe, just maybe, she can find a home for herself.

*Will Rowena run from Morgan and Hattie? Will she escape or will she not?*

# Chapter 4 Running

She knew she was letting go of a lot of supplies, but there was nothing for it. She didn’t know Kwent, but she did know that Morgan could fly and she needed to get under cover as quickly as possible.

Like every city or town, Kwent had a maze of narrow alleyways. Her shoes pattering on the ground, she dodged past onlookers, slipping under their gaze. 

Pulling her wand out from where she’d stuck it into an inner shirt pocket, she muttered under her breath with labored breathing, one of the few spells she knew and could cast.

“Rowena, wait! We don’t mean any harm!” yelled Hattie. 

The words rang true in Rowena’s heart, almost halting her spell. The pair were kind, happy, and they either cared for, or were deeply in love with one another. There wasn’t any way two people who shared that affection could be truly horrible.

But Rowena couldn’t tell them what she’d seen. She didn’t know if it would happen.

Oh, that was a lie. She was quite certain the pair were going to die in the fire.

So why didn’t she want to tell them? 

Hide first, think later.

Rowena looked up. The alleyway she was in was coming to a deserted crossstreet. Underneath, flying in the wind, were strewn laundry-lines of linens and clothing. 

That would have to do for cover. Rounding the corner, she found a covered water barrel, the type used to keep spare water for fighting spot fires. Every town had these barrels set at street corners, for the risk of fire was always high in such places.

Dropping her pack behind the barrel, she ripped the cover off and leapt into the water as she cast her spell. Sylva had only taught her a few parlor tricks, but this one was incredibly useful. It allowed her to deaden the sounds near her. She certainly needed to deaden the splashing and sloshing of the water that soaked through her thin clothing. With a wave of her wand, she floated the barrel’s cover back onto the barrel and submerged herself into darkness.

Thankfully, for some reason, there wasn’t much water in the barrel. It was not even half-full, but it was enough to soak Rowena to her chest. Wrapping her thin arms around hearself, Rowena bit her lip as she tried to resist the urge to get out of the freezing water. Perhaps her effort was in vain, but there was nothing she could do. She couldn’t outrun the two women and they were far more skilled mages. All she could do was try to take advantage of the fact they didn’t know if she had this kind of magic.

Of course, that was if they didn’t suspect she was the person who set the fire in Leipmont. 

Panting, holding her own throat with one hand to try to slow her breathing, Rowena froze as she heard wingbeats from not one, but two distinct sets of wings. The water level was surprisingly not too high and it only went up to her shoulders. She could hear the pair.

“I lost her. How…where did she go?” Morgan squawked.

Hattie whistled a tune and a dark blue glow shone through the gaps between the barrel’s lid and the staves. “It seems Rowena is holding onto some secrets and maybe a surprise or two. I doubt we shall be seeing her soon.”

Morgan’s claws made a distinct click-click sound as she strutted on the cobblestone. “She said she was heading for Athelda-Aoun. Maybe she’s a refugee? But why would she be so scared of us? We’ve welcomed orphans including those who have committed petty crimes. There’s nothing to be scared of.”

“I don’t know, my love, but I lament that we can’t find her. I’m worried we might have scared her away. I just hope that wherever she is, and whoever she is, she may find happiness,” said Hattie.

“I hope so too. Nobody deserves to be that terrified. I…I remember what that was like.” A pause and Morgan sighed. “Thank you, Hattie. Just a bad memory. In any case, it is rather strange that she knew my name. Do you think I should mention that in my call to mom?”

“Yes, she will know what to do with that information, especially since we do have work to do. Kwent needs to be protected,” said Hattie.

“Yes. We know the next arson attack is likely to be here—” There was a hiss as Morgan sucked in a sharp breath. “Hattie…we need to talk in private, back at the White Order House.”

“Alright.”

The click-click sounds of Morgan’s feet and the more duller sound of Hattie’s boots started to grow soft as Rowena continued to shiver in the dark water.

She’d ran and successfully escaped the two mages.

So why did she feel so horrible? Why…why were tears trickling down her cheeks?

Alone, in that cold wet barrel, Rowena shivered, but not from the cold. 

Morgan and Hattie were going to die, trying and failing to protect Kwent. They were going to die and she wasn’t going to stop them. How could she stop them anyway? Telling them what she saw in her vision wasn’t going to work. She couldn’t save them. 

Besides, what if they did believe her? What if they found out she could see the future, and the past? 

What if they didn’t want her to stop seeing the future and the past? What if they wrote up a contract and forced her to keep using the only gift that had been hers alone?

What if she saw the future and those two kind women were going to die if she did nothing?

What kind of person would she be?

Rowena opened her eyes and with shaking hands, pushed open the barrel lid.

The cross street was deserted. She pulled herself out of the tall barrel as best she could. As she put one foot over the edge, she slipped.

She slid onto the cobblestone with a thud. Her thin frame shuddered as she went sprawling. The sharp pain jolted her senses, and made her whimper all the more.

Even so, her dilemma, and her decision hadn’t changed.



# Chapter 5 The White Order Safe House

Still damp, hair matted against the sides of her head, Rowena knocked on the door to the house she’d been directed to by one of the town guards.

The White Order was a continent-spanning mage order with many chapters and branches. Originally it welcomed humans only, but since the Great War, its Grandmaster Edana had opened membership to Alavari. Working with human kingdoms such as Erisale, and their former foe, the Kingdom of Alavaria, the order was now synonymous with peacekeeping and being a bridge between the Alavari and Humans of Durannon. As a result, they often had distinctively marked branch offices and headquarters in various towns that Rowena had often passed by. Often, they flew a white banner with two parallel gold stripes running down.

The Kwent guest-house was the opposite to these. It was a slightly larger than average row house close to the gatehouse on the Alavaria side, tucked between two more houses of its kind. It was difficult to tell it apart from the others except for a small flag that hung right above the doorway. A second doorstep stone that led to a plaster wall led Rowena to realise that this had originally been two houses that were now conjoined.

The door opened. “Hello—Oh.” Hattie blinked as she looked down on Rowena, her dark-blue eyes wide.

“Um, hi. I guess you have questions?”

Hattie did an admirable job recovering her composure because she’d returned an albeit strained smile on her face in record time. “I believe so. Do come in please.” Extending a hand, she gestured for Rowena to come in and closed the door behind them. “Morgan, Rowena’s come to the door.”

Rowena stepped in, noting the narrow staircase and bannistered gallery it led to, which was built over a hallway that led to the ground floor rooms. 

Suddenly, the sound of ruffling feathers filled the air. Something large jumped from the first floor. Rowena leapt back, stumbling straight into Hattie as Morgan landed in front of her, wings extended. She nearly fell, but Hattie caught her with gentle arms.

“Morgan!” Hattie whined.

“Oh, terribly sorry about that,” Morgan pulled in her wings and came to one knee. “We’re sorry for chasing you Rowena—by Galena, you’re soaked—oh! You hid in the water barrel.”

“Yes. I’m fine. Really,” said Rowena.

Morgan arched an eyebrow and sighed. “Alright, at least follow us up. Hattie can you get the building wards?”

“Why—Oh, of course.” Letting go of Rowena, Hattie turned and with her staff began to mutter Words of Power. Swallowing, Rowena followed Morgan up the stairs, past a number of rooms with closed doors and into a small dining room with windows that overlooked the street.

“Tea or cocoa?” Morgan asked. She pursed her lips for a moment before meeting Rowena’s eye. “You have to choose.”

Rowena blinked, mouth agape. How—she shook her head. That wasn’t important. “Tea.”

Nodding, Morgan waved her white wand and sang. The magic of Durnanon was also often channelled by song after all. The harpy-troll’s voice was particularly bright and clear, and that directly translated to power.

An oh-so-gentle force guided Rowena to a chair at the head of the table, which moved aside for her to sit down at. Her backpack was plucked off her shoulders and set down onto the floor beside her. The kettle sitting on top of a small stovetop fireplace whistled as plates and cutlery flew from opening and closing wooden drawers. 

The kettle poured hot water into a teapot, and then for a metal lidded tankard from which Rowena could smell was coffee. Meanwhile, a sugar bowl and a pitcher of milk floated from the nearby kitchen to the table, along with a stack of cookies and biscuits.

Hattie was soon upstairs and seated herself as Morgan continued to wave her wand, pouring cups of tea for herself and Rowena, whilst a cup of coffee for Hattie. Two sugar cubes were dropped into Morgan’s cup whilst only milk was poured for Hattie’s. Great fluffy towels floated down from some other floor in the house and draped themselves across Rowena’s shoulders. The harpy-troll then settled at her seat flanking Rowena with the grace and poise of a princess.

“Before we ask, eat and get warm. We’re not in any rush,” said Morgan.

“I…are you sure?” Rowena asked.

Hattie nodded, warming her hands with the cup. “Unless you have anywhere to go, we truly are in no hurry. Oh, and your pony is in one of the Order stables and we have the rest of your belongings safely stowed here.”

“Thank you.” Rowena swallowed and picked up two sugar cubes from the bowl and plopped them into her tea before taking the cup in her hand.

She stared at the melting cubes as they broke apart, bit by bit, sugar particles dissolving into the brown liquid. Looking up, she could see Morgan sipping her tea held in one hand, whilst the other held a rectangular cookie. She wasn’t even looking at Rowena, but out of the window, one arm languishing on the chair’s back. 

Hattie was watching Rowena at the corner of her eye, and didn’t stop even when Rowena glanced at her. She just sipped her coffee quietly, occasionally taking a deep sniff of the dark brown concoction.

“I heard a little of what you were talking about in the alley,” said Rowena.

“Ah, I expected you did. Very clever to hide from us in that water barrel. Though, Morgan and I couldn’t figure out how we couldn’t hear you,” said Hattie.

Rowena closed her eyes and with one hand, she pulled out the stick that served as her wand. “I know a little magic.”

“May I?” Rowena nodded as Morgan put her biscuit down and reached over. Still chewing, the harpy-troll looked down the length of the wand before putting it down just where she’d taken it. “You have very good control to cast a sound-deadening spell with just this stick.”

Rowena didn’t know what to think about that compliment. She couldn't remember if she ever had been complimented by Lady Sylva, or anyone. The few staff Lady Sylva had at her manor knew to leave her alone and aside from giving her clothing and food, left her alone. Lady Sylva had personally instructed her on language and the basic mathematics and she’d never been complimented.  It was just “good,” “adequate,” “do it again,” and “are you even trying?”

Rowena finally sipped her tea. The sweet liquid poured down and warmed her to the core. The fluffy towels were so soft against her neck and arms. She put her cup down and had a biscuit, one shaped like a flower and the flavor of butter exploded in her mouth.

It was warm, right, and good. Yet it also felt all the things she didn’t want to feel right now. The doubts and fears in her mind flooded to the forefront, bubbling and breaking apart like the sugar cubes that had dissolved into her cup.

What was she even doing here? Who did she think she was, telling White Order mages abut what she’d seen in visions only he knew about? She didn’t even know who she was or where she was from. She could be in huge trouble, or none at all. She didn’t know, she was completely in over her head and she didn’t know how Morgan or Hattie would react.

She took another bite of the biscuit and took a deep breath as Morgan waved her wand again, adding charcoal to the stove. The smell of clean smoke bringing Rowena back to her vision, and everything it entailed.

She chewed, swallowed and closed her eyes. Maybe, just maybe, stopping that would be enough.

“I set the fire at Leipmont, Lehrbach and many smaller ones in Conthwaite and other places. I’m sorry. I…I kept them as small as I could, and for the Leipmont one, I did pull the bell, but I couldn’t warn the town guard. I wanted to, but I couldn’t,” Rowena said.

Morgan’s jaw tightened as Hattie blinked. “Why couldn’t you?” asked the half-troll.

“Until a week ago, ever since I was a baby, I’ve been a slave under a magical contract. I don’t remember who my parents are, or were. I don’t know who or what I am. I just know I have magic and a…a gift.” Rowena closed her eyes. She shouldn’t say. She couldn’t. If she did and they wanted to use her—

The pair of dead bodies on the cobblestones, hands interlinked even in death. The screams from their wands.

“I can see possible futures. I saw you both dead and Kwent in flames.” Rowena met Morgan’s arched eyebrow. “Your wand was screaming. He called you ‘impudent brat’ and asked you what would he say to your mother.”

Morgan’s hand shot to her wand, her jaw falling open as Rowena turned to Hattie. “Your staff said that you promised to live long.”

The cup fell from Hattie’s grasp, clanging on the ground. Muttering something about anti-shatter glass, the half-troll got up and wiped up the spilled coffee, her hands shaking.

“Rowena, do your visions always come true?” Morgan asked, hands tight around her wand.

Rowena shook her head. “No. They’re always of possible futures. The farther in the future they are, the less likely. I didn’t think this would happen—I hoped it wouldn’t, but then I ran into both of you on the bridge.” 

“And if we’re here in Kwent, dressed as we are in death I imagine, then whatever future circumstance is happening is coming soon,” said Hattie. The half troll sat back down, eyes closing briefly as she interlaced her fingers. “Well, at least we died together my dear.”

In the middle of wiping her eyes, Morgan snorted. “The question is what the hell could take us both down together?” Rubbing her chin, the harpy-troll let out a breath and leaned forward on her elbows. “Rowena, this probably isn’t an easy question for you to answer, but who was enslaving you? I promise that you won’t be in trouble. We don’t punish former slaves for obeying commands. Especially if they are children.”

Rowena didn’t know what to feel about that, but perhaps it did make her feel more at ease as the words seemed to spill from her lps. “I don’t know if you know her. She’s a noblewoman called Lady Sylva.”

“Sylva? Sylva of Redglen?” Hattie asked, her eyes narrowing.

“Gnarled right hand, blue eyes, sometimes likes to cover it with a glove or sock?” Morgan asked.

“Yes, how did you know?” Rowena asked, blinking. She couldn’t recall having ever met or Sylva having met Morgan or Hattie before. She would have remembered.

“When the Red Order was disbanded after the princess’s kidnapping, a number of their former members went rogue, or have decided to work against Erisdale. Sylva is one of them and she’s under suspicion for a number of crimes, but we hadn’t found anything to tie her because well, much of the evidence keeps conveniently going up in flames,” said Morgan, her fingers drumming on the table. 

“Well now we know why they kept being set on fire. She’d enslaved Rowena here, but…” Hattie blinked. “How did you escape?”

 Rowena took another sip of tea. “I saw where she put my contract paper in a vision, found it and tore it up. I…I wasn’t sure if it would work, but it did.” She studied Morgan and Hattie, whose eyes were both fixed on the table. “Please, I know it sounds crazy but you have to believe me.”

Morgan grimaced. “Oh, I think we both believe you. It explains way too much.”

“Yes it does.” Hattie reached out her hand and very slowly, placed it on Rowena’s arm. “You’ve been very brave, Rowena. I know this must have been hard for you.”

“It…I…” Rowena bit her lip. Something was welling up behind her eyes, a weight that refused to go away dragged her head down. “Am I really not in trouble?”

“No. You’re not and we’re going to keep you safe from Sylva,” said Hattie.

Morgan coughed into her fist. “If you’re worried about your visions, we can keep them secret too. We’ll need some more information to verify what we learned in another way, but I think we won’t need to reveal your gift, if you don’t want to.”

Rowena looked at the two women, turning her head to try to catch both of them in her field of vision. Were they lying? Were they really telling the truth? Because things were working out too well.

“I don’t understand. How did you know that? That I didn’t want anybody to know? Why didn’t you just… make me answer you?”

Morgan and Hattie exchanged a glance. Hattie tilted her head toward Morgan, who nodded and smiled but it wasn’t a happy one. 

“Hattie and I have been through a lot in our youth. As you know, we lived and fought through the Great War and survived through things that no child ought to have needed to survive through. We don’t know what you’ve been through, but you remind us both of what we swore never to let happen to any child.”

Hattie nodded, one hand massaging her scarred forehead. “Things that Sylva is clearly insistent on revisiting and reliving. Morgan, we might need to summon reinforcements. From what we know about the fires, Sylva’s likely connected to what may happen, and while I don’t want to put complete faith in that vision, she or her allies somehow overwhelmed both of us. There’s something we don’t know about her plans.”

Morgan nodded and withdrew a hand mirror from a pocket on her dress. Head still reeling, unable to believe what had just happened and how it hadn’t landed her in jail, Rowena frowned as she realised something.

“Wait, what do you mean by ‘as you know?’ The vision only showed me your wands calling you by name,” she said.

Hattie blinked and giggled. “Oh, that’s all? Ah, well you see—Hm, hold that, there’s a knock on our door.”

“I’ll get that,” said Morgan, getting up from her chair.

“Don’t jump—oh of course you did,” said Hattie as Morgan leapt over the bannister.

A few seconds later, she flew up, her eyes wide, wand in her hand, cold fury etched across her face. 

“Hattie, Sylva’s here.”

1hl8fwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1hl8fwi/two_seconds_away/,Two seconds away,"This morning, I told my wife we couldn’t afford gifts for each other this year. Then her coffee maker broke. I thought, “I can manage that”, so I decided to work harder to earn enough to buy her a new one for Christmas. I was so excited about surprising her that I couldn’t wait—I gave it to her early. 

But when she looked at it, she said, “Why did you get that? We can’t afford it.” Her words hit me like a brick wall. My heart sank. I wanted to break down right there.  

Just two years ago, we were living a life that felt like a dream. I wasn’t struggling like this. I was doing meaningful work, and my purpose felt clear: to live as an example for the kids I work with, to show them that if I could overcome my struggles, so could they. But everything changed, and now I feel like I’m drowning.  

Since 2022, it’s been one hard blow after another. Losing my brother was devastating. Getting laid off made me feel useless. And no matter how much I try to hold it together, I know my wife sees through the cracks. I try to act like everything will be okay, but deep down, I’m not sure it will.  

I’m 37 years old, and I feel like I’ve failed—failed my family, failed my dreams, and failed myself. All I’ve ever wanted was to take care of the people I love, but instead, I feel like I’m barely surviving. Today is especially hard. It marks two years since my brother was murdered, and it’s also the anniversary of earning my Master’s degree in a field that feels utterly useless.  

I’m drowning—not just in debt but in the weight of my own expectations and disappointments. Sometimes, I feel like the people I work so hard to support don’t even see it. I’m on the verge of losing my car and my house, all for chasing a dream that now feels like it’s mocking me. I keep telling myself, *This is just temporary,* but I have to force myself to believe it.  

The truth is, I’m exhausted. Physically, emotionally, mentally—just tired. And while I try to push forward, deep down, I don’t know how much more I have left in me.  

I’m just tired

It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",2,1735024938.0,HighStrangeness,1,0.75,False

I did thank him like usual. Actually more than usual because I was trying to hit a number of throne gifts before the month ends. His send made me 1 gift closer to my goal 🤣

We did some catching up and brief discussion of Christmas plans. Then he came admitting that he has been considering to quit findom as a whole. He wanted to rediscover life and he believes his kinks are getting on the way. Plus, he thinks it's making things reclusive. 

Being someone who had professionally dealt with people suffering from mental health, I really did see patterns on his verbal cues. 

Right there and then I knew I have to let him go. I assured him and even encouraged him of to go with his short term plans. That I would kick him out of the findom door myself. 

As much as I love having a coffee sub, this one has to go. That one coffee send was bittersweet but fulfilling at the same time. I am glad I have established enough trust that he knows he can be honest with his thoughts and emotions. I think this is the best Christmas gift I could ever give him.

I have always been loyal and have proven that I have his trust ranging from small things like guys hitting on me on a night out (he's always been there) and people sliding into my dms to bigger things like my exes calling me. I have always been upfront that something happened and how I handled it, eg blocking them or telling them I have a boyfriend. 

However at work I have a couple much older coworkers (30+ one f and two m all with kids) and after some issues with management I have decided to put in my resignation. During this time all my coworkers have helped me and guided/mentored me through these challenges. At the end of the day I'm super grateful to have that support system at work. I often get lunch or coffee with them and most of the time they've paid I assume it's because I'm much younger. Lately my bf and I have gotten into disagreements because he thinks it's not right that I'm close with the guys in particular, he's fine with my female coworker but have a major problem with the guys. 

First problem was one of the guys had a major injury that required surgery and I suggested that he is clearly having a hard time recovering as his family doesn't like in state and he only sees his son during weekends because he is divorced. My boyfriend got upset ""that I cared that much for another man"" and we had a big fight because I told him that getting dinner (the two of us with him) would be nice for his mental health. 

Second time was when I asked him to pick up something for me as a way to say thank you to another coworker (this one is happily married with two kids, I have mentioned this multiple times) especially because he is the one who has been the biggest mentor to me and he understands my struggles as we are from the same culture in a predominantly white workplace. My boyfriend then said "" it's weird that you're asking me to buy a present for you to give another man"" I have always assured my bf that any breach of the boundaries I have in place will result in an immediate end of friendship but that would never ever happen in the first place because these are good people who would never do anything like that.

1hl84mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1hl84mh/fuck_off_christmas/,FUCK OFF CHRISTMAS!!! 🫣,"So, Christmas after a breakup. It’s honestly the WORST, isn’t it? Like, everywhere you look, there are happy couples doing the whole “matching pyjamas, Christmas market, oh-look-how-in-love-we-are” thing 🤮🤮🤮and you’re just sitting there wondering how the hell you’re going to get through the next few weeks without crying into a tin of Quality Street.

I get it. Breakups suck any time of year, but Christmas just adds a WHOLE other layer of ugh to it. 

The traditions you used to share? Ruined. The cute little bauble you bought together last year? Now just a painful reminder that you’re single and miserable. And don’t even get me started on the endless stream of romantic Christmas movies. It’s enough to make anyone throw their TV out the window.

But, here’s the thing … you don’t HAVE to let this season completely crush you. There are ways to survive it without going full-on Grinch mode!! And this is efstvus helping me 

For starters, get yourself OUT of the house. I know the temptation to stay in your pyjamas all day and wallow is strong, but trust me, it won’t help. Go to the gym, even if it’s just to walk on the treadmill and blast angry breakup songs. Endorphins are REAL, and they work. Plus, you’ll feel a tiny bit smug that you did something productive.

Talk to your friends. This is the time to lean on your people. Message them, call them, meet up for coffee … whatever works. True friends will let you rant about your ex for as long as you need and remind you of all the reasons they weren’t good enough for you anyway. If nothing else, they’ll probably buy you a drink, and that’s never a bad thing.

Make plans. Seriously, keep yourself busy. Say yes to anything and everything … Christmas parties, movie nights, random trips to see the lights. It doesn’t matter what it is, as long as it stops you from sitting at home scrolling through your ex’s Instagram stories. Oh, and maybe block them for a bit if you haven’t already. Trust me, you don’t need to see what they’re up to (worst thing EVER)

If you’re feeling really stuck, pick up a good book. I found one called [Are You Not Over It Yet?](https://amzn.eu/d/9CVqvSl)and it’s basically like having a brutally honest best friend in your corner. It’s full of practical advice and the occasional reality check, which is exactly what you need when you’re tempted to text your ex “Merry Christmas” at 2 a.m. (Spoiler: DONT do that.)

And lastly, just be kind to yourself. Christmas might not feel magical this year, and that’s okay. You don’t have to force yourself to feel festive or pretend you’re fine when you’re not. Take it one day at a time, focus on what feels good for you, and remember: this is just one Christmas. Next year will be different, and by then, you’ll probably be laughing at the fact that you ever wasted tears on someone who didn’t deserve you.

You’ve got this … we can get for it together and feel free to write down how you’re feeling here and we can support each other through it all💪💪💪",2,1735023799.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I was at the salon getting my hair done, and I sent my boyfriend to Dutch bros to get me a coffee, it was just espresso with ice and oatmilk. I took my first few sips and then about 20-30 minutes later I noticed that my hands were really itchy, then I got a couple of bumps on my arms that looked like bug bites and itched, then my face got super hot and red, then my lips started to get a little swollen. At this point I sent my boyfriend to the store to get me some Claritin since I could tell it was an allergic reaction! Thankfully there was a bunch of really nice ladies there helping me, we took off my salon cape and my hairdresser saw I had hives all over my chest and neck! Thankfully soon after my guy came back with the Claritin my symptoms went away. It was so scary though!!

The only things I had that morning were

10:40AM: jalapeo corndog 11:15AM: chili cheese corn dog (I love corn dogs)

2:00PM(ish): I started drinking my oatmilk espresso 2:20-2:30: my symptoms start 2:55: I take Claritin

Around 4PM I was completely back to normal, including my lips swelling.

I think it was the oatmilk I was allergic to, I had espresso yesterday with regular milk and was completely fine! One of my friends think they could’ve not rinsed the espresso cleaner good enough, and that gave me a reaction? I’ve had oatmilk in the past and have been completely fine, and oat just seems like such a weird thing to be allergic to.

Now I’m so scared to eat or drink anything in fear of a worse reaction, I need advice! 😞",1,1735023715.0,FoodAllergies,4,1.0,False

I used to absolutely hate this fact because i never ever said no to communication or anything. Like i get it we weren’t doing labels but man cmon?!. Infact i used to initiate it as well. Well it went for about 2 months. Last to last week, when i asked him if he is free to meet after office, he said he was free. I told him to meet me downstairs (4 mins gap) to which he replied that he has left for his place!?? Like why tell me that you are free in the first place right. Along side, he has not replied to my text either on WA or Insta. I believed that he is just a guy and too afraid to be the bad guy to end it and hence is ghosting me. Still i waited till monday (we have agreed on planning a date for monday in our conversation) but no text came. So i moved on. Last weekend, after having drinks with my friends, a guy hit me up so i went out for a coffee with him. Which led to other things.

Let's be honest, waking up to the aroma of freshly brewed coffee is a ritual many of us cherish. But have you ever wondered if that delightful morning elixir could be the culprit behind a less-than-delightful side effect? We’re talking about bad breath, or as it's clinically known, halitosis. The relationship between coffee and breath freshness is more complex than you might think, and it's a question that swirls around in the minds of coffee lovers everywhere: does coffee give you bad breath? This article delves deep into the science, dispelling myths and uncovering the truth about coffee's impact on your breath. From the chemical compounds in your favorite brew to practical tips for mitigating any potential odor issues, we'll spill the beans on everything you need to know. So grab your mug, settle in, and let's explore this aromatic dilemma together.

Does Coffee Give You Bad Breath? Unraveling the Aromatic Enigma
---------------------------------------------------------------

The million-dollar question - does coffee give you bad breath? While not a direct cause of bad breath in the same way that, say, garlic is, coffee can contribute to a less-than-fresh feeling in your mouth. Think of your mouth as a delicate ecosystem. A variety of factors, from the foods you eat to your oral hygiene habits, influence the balance of bacteria residing within. Coffee, with its acidity and distinctive odor-causing compounds, can temporarily disrupt this balance, leading to what many perceive as ""coffee breath.""

### The Science Behind Coffee Breath

So, what's the scientific scoop? Well, coffee's impact on your breath isn't due to some magical, breath-souring property. Instead, it's a combination of factors:

1. **Dry Mouth:** Coffee's caffeine content can dry out your mouth. Saliva is your natural mouthwash, helping to flush away food particles and bacteria that cause bad breath. Less saliva means these odor-causing culprits hang around longer.
2. **Sulfur Compounds:** Coffee beans contain sulfur compounds, which are released during the roasting and brewing process. These sulfurous compounds, while contributing to coffee's enticing aroma, can also linger in your mouth, creating an unpleasant smell. It's a double-edged sword, folks.
3. **Acidity:** Coffee's acidity creates an ideal environment for bacteria to thrive. These bacteria break down food particles and proteins in your mouth, releasing volatile sulfur compounds (VSCs), the primary cause of bad breath.
4. **Sticky Situation:** Coffee can be a bit…clingy. It can stick to your tongue and the lining of your mouth, providing a breeding ground for bacteria and prolonging the presence of odor-causing compounds.

### Coffee Breath vs. Other Causes of Halitosis

Now, before you swear off your morning cuppa, remember, coffee breath is usually temporary and distinct from chronic halitosis. Chronic bad breath can be a sign of underlying health issues like gum disease or other medical conditions. If you’re concerned about persistent bad breath, it’s always best to consult with a dentist or doctor. Think of coffee breath as a fleeting guest, while chronic halitosis is a long-term tenant.

Does Coffee Give You Bad Breath? Debunking the Myths and Misconceptions
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

The internet is rife with myths and half-truths about coffee and bad breath. Let's set the record straight:

- **Myth:** All coffee causes equally bad breath. **Reality:** Different types of coffee can have varying effects. Darker roasts, for example, tend to contain more sulfur compounds, potentially leading to a stronger coffee breath. Think of it like comparing a whisper to a shout – both are sounds, but one is definitely more noticeable.
- **Myth:** Only black coffee causes bad breath. **Reality:** While adding milk or cream might mask the coffee smell temporarily, it can also provide additional food for bacteria in your mouth, potentially exacerbating the issue in the long run. It's like trying to hide a mess under a rug – eventually, it'll still stink.
- **Myth:** Brushing your teeth immediately after drinking coffee eliminates coffee breath. **Reality:** Brushing right after consuming acidic beverages like coffee can actually weaken your enamel. It's better to wait about 30 minutes before brushing.

""SECRET of Fresh breath https://freepage.pro/samutores/freshbreath""

Does Coffee Give You Bad Breath? Practical Tips for Fresher Breath
------------------------------------------------------------------

So, we've established that coffee *can* contribute to bad breath. But don't despair, coffee aficionados! There are several steps you can take to minimize coffee breath and enjoy your favorite brew without compromising your fresh breath confidence:

- **Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate!** Water is your best friend when it comes to combating coffee breath. Drinking water throughout the day, especially after your coffee, helps wash away odor-causing residue and keeps your mouth hydrated. Remember, saliva is your natural mouthwash.
- **Chew Sugar-Free Gum:** Chewing sugar-free gum stimulates saliva production, helping neutralize acids and dislodge trapped food particles. Look for gum containing xylitol, a natural sweetener that inhibits the growth of odor-causing bacteria.
- **Tongue Scraping:** Your tongue can harbor a surprising amount of bacteria. Incorporating a tongue scraper into your oral hygiene routine can significantly reduce the bacterial load and freshen your breath.
- **Maintain Good Oral Hygiene:** This seems like a no-brainer, but it’s crucial. Brushing and flossing twice daily removes food particles and plaque that contribute to bad breath. Remember that 30-minute rule after drinking coffee before brushing.
- **Choose Lighter Roasts:** Experiment with lighter roasts, which generally contain fewer sulfur compounds than darker roasts.
- **Rinse Your Mouth:** After enjoying your coffee, simply rinsing your mouth with water can help dislodge coffee residue and freshen your breath quickly. It’s a quick and easy fix.
- **Consider Coffee Alternatives:** If you're particularly sensitive to coffee breath, you might explore alternative beverages like herbal tea or chicory coffee.

Beyond Coffee: Other Dietary Culprits of Bad Breath
---------------------------------------------------

While coffee often takes the blame, other dietary factors can contribute to bad breath, including:

- **Garlic and Onions:** These pungent vegetables contain sulfur compounds that are absorbed into the bloodstream and released through your lungs, causing lingering bad breath.
- **Dairy Products:** The proteins in dairy can be broken down by bacteria in your mouth, producing unpleasant odors.
- **Sugary Foods and Drinks:** Sugar provides fuel for bacteria, leading to increased acid production and bad breath.
- **Alcohol:** Alcohol dries out your mouth, creating a more hospitable environment for odor-causing bacteria.

Remember, maintaining fresh breath is a holistic endeavor. A balanced diet, regular hydration, and good oral hygiene are all essential pieces of the puzzle.

Conclusion
----------

So, does coffee give you bad breath? The answer isn’t a simple yes or no. While coffee itself doesn't directly cause bad breath, its properties can contribute to a temporary, less-than-fresh feeling in your mouth. By understanding the science behind coffee breath and implementing some simple strategies, you can continue to enjoy your daily dose of caffeine without sacrificing your breath confidence. So go ahead, savor that aromatic cup, and keep your breath minty fresh!",1,1735023654.0,FreshBreathChampion,0,1.0,False

Especially now we have a baby","I love my husband more than I could ever imagine loving someone. I was never even interested in anyone else before I met him,  but by him I was fascinated since day 1 and in my eyes he is the perfect man, except for this one thing :before we met he went through a crazy slutty phase. 
He was having affairs with married women, went through god knows how many one night stands, had threesomes, purposely had sex with girls as young as possible ( of legal age ofc) , purposely tried (and succeeded) to have sex with women from as many different countries as possible and so much more. On the other hand , I am almost a decade and a half younger than him and had 0 romantic/sexual experience before I met him. This makes me feel so humiliated, so used, so inferior. I have to live with the fact I saw his old comments on instagram under thirst trap photos of a married woman he had an affair with in which he compliments her. I have to live knowing he has memories of all this wild sexual adventures while he has nothing to be jealous of. I have to live knowing that he is my first everything while I am just one out of many same things to him. The reason I stayed with him despite his past is becsuse I was slowly finding out about it, as I was getting more and more attached to him and unable to leave.

Now I am in this weird situation where I could be the happiest woman on earth but I am not. I live with the man I love more than anything in the world  and our beautiful two weeks old baby girl. He does everything to make me happy. He completely takes care of the finances and enables us a nice lifestyle while I don't work. He got us a beautiful  apartnent, paid for me to give birth at a private clinic, pays for things like my dad's tickets to come visit us, a bit of tuitions fees I had left , my psychologist and the list goes on. He takes me to expensive restaurats and trips and always tries to come up with ways to cheer me up. Life with him is just so fun and beautiful .He showers me with compliments all day long and helped me overcome a lot of insecurities I had. He wakes me up with kisses every morning and makes me my cold coffee, he carries me from bedroom to living room with my pillow and blanket "" so that transition from sleeping to state of awakeness wouldn't be too harsh"".  When we first met we lived in different countries and he immediately stopped going out and instead started spending evenings on the phone with me. He brings me little treats I like. He  takes shifts taking care of the baby so I can get uninterrupted sleep too and he is amazing with her. He is so gentle and loving  with us and I know how lucky I am.  My psychologist said I got the sort of many every woman wants .

Yet, despite all of this so often it happens that I cry myself to sleep , thinking about his past. It is so hard to understand and make peace with the fact that someone that I love so much was once attracted to other women  and had all those exciting and sexy adventures with others. I literally vomited multiple times when I saw those old compliments he wrote to another women. It has also happened that I start crying in the middle of sex imaging all those other women in my place . Another thing that hurts a lot is he never said he regrets his past. He does say  things like :"" It meant nothing"",  or :"" Everything in this world is meaningles and worthless compared to you"", but he also insists he doesn't regret anything about his past because every decision he made lead to him being who he is today. He often asks what it is that I need from him to feel better and I don't know how to respond and put my feelings into words, but it is almost like I feel indebted by him and the universe and like some big sacrifice needs to be made to make things right again. 

I know probably noone read this long novel, but in case I am wrong : thanks for reading, venting helps a lot. In case you have any advice, I would greatly appreciate it.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about. Plus open contact.",1,1735023509.0,NonHumanIntelligence,0,1.0,False

1hl7z1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/CPTSDrelationships/comments/1hl7z1y/help_me_pls_context_sibling_suffering_with_cptsd/,"HELP. Me. Pls. (Context: Sibling suffering with C-PTSD, currently raging)","I really need help. Anybody with the capacity to help, please do, because I have nobody to turn to. Sorry if this is rather long-winded, inarticulate, and meandering, I am not thinking straight...

This is a post about my brother who is suffering from C-PTSD, on top of depression and anxiety. Me and my mother are currently hopeless, and do not know how things will end.  
  
He is currently having another ""rage episode"" for lack of a better term, screaming and cursing at my mother at random times, or any time he remembers one of his grievances.  
  
Today, he removed my mother's TV from the living room, so she has nothing to do all day, except go about her chores in fear. He told her to ""watch out"" after some village officials came to our home to speak with him (due to the commotion), which only further fueled his rage at her. Unfortunately, these officials can't do anything and don't seem to care or understand.  
  
Yesterday, my brother was pounding things and occasionally shouting in his room like a maniac. My mother thinks this is triggered by the fact that my other sibling will be returning home next year, whereas my brother was not allowed two years ago and had to plead with us (he was staying at our dad's family in the US and was there to work), which I think was a sensible decision on our part because he was in a hyper-aggressive/-volatile state back then, so we did it out of fear, considering that we are only two women.  
  
Of course, this triggered some abandonment/rejection issues in him. Because when he was a child, my parents had to work abroad, and he was sent off to my grandmother here I think at age 6, resulting I guess in culture shock/alienation/estrangement, and a sense of abandonment (since he had to be separated from my mother for a few years). I would like to mention that he stopped therapy months ago, and I don't think he's taking his meds.  
  
Ever since he came home this year, my mother had to play along every single day, and wrack her brains trying to guess what she should do to keep him happy, or at least stable, because otherwise, he would just self-isolate in his room all day and not say anything.  
  
What do you do when you have an almost-30 child who does not want to help himself, to the point of just lying around all day doing nothing for a year, and yet curses/verbally abuses you for ""making him the way he is,"" despite making every attempt to help him? It's an endless cycle  
  
My mother would do everything for him, cook for him, drive him wherever, socialize with him (he doesn't have any friends), send him to the most expensive therapist, whatever... she's been doing this for a year, and yet this is the culmination...  
  
His rages are usually on-and-off, so we've gotten used to the pattern this year. When it is ""off,"" he and my mother are like best friends, playfully chatting and joking around, which is why we held out hope of him getting better, but now that the year is closing, we're at a lost.  
  
Yesterday, my mother slept with me in my room, and when he climbed up the stairs on his way to us, I did not know what was going to happen... Maybe I'm catastrophizing, but the quiet rage in his face made me think he was about to kill us, despite the fact that so far this year or ever, no physical violence has occurred.  
  
My mother also told me about his mind-games as in ""loyalty tests"", which she said was already something he did even as a kid, before he was abandoned. I do not really know how to account for it. When he was a kid, he would command my mother to do things, otherwise all hell breaks loose and he would break into a tantrum. It could be something as little as him not wanting her to wear a hairclip, or not wanting her to sit with my dad.  
  
Recently, this happened again. While they were at the mall, my mother managed to ""wean"" him off for an hour, that is, let him roam by himself, which ever since he came home, he barely ever did due to his anxiety. When they met up again after an hour, my mother wanted to buy some pastries at a shop nearby, and so told him to just meet her there while he ate at a restaurant.  
  
Apparently, this was cause for another rage attack. It is possible other things happened that day, like maybe my mother did not give him enough money (which I know he does not like). This rage manifested as him cursing in public and throwing the pastry package to the ground.  
  
After my mother brought him to a nearby coffee shop to calm him down, he commanded her that they will re-visit every single shop they went to at the mall, I guess to ""punish"" her and prove her loyalty, or something.  
  
Because of this, they arrived home late that day. It is just impossible to know what will trigger him.Pre-COVID, my brother was actually taking meds and was at his very best, but when he turned 25 he realized he had to start his life, and that's when he relapsed into darkness. And then the US happened, life didn't turn out as planned, etc. and now here he is.  
  
My mother doesn't know what to do anymore. I am not kidding when I say she is the most indefatigable person I know, even to an unusual degree, and yet right now she is breaking down and seems like she just wants to end it all. She has no escape, and she knows it is possible that she will be spending the rest of her days being psychologically abused by her son. I don't know how to help her.  
  
The only way I've been coping this year has been by way of making these type of venting posts, but they just end up getting ignored. I have no access to a psychiatrist to help me figure this out either. My other sibling is unresponsive. I don't. know. what. to. do.  
  
It is frightening to see someone just all of a sudden lose all empathy, because I don't know how or when it will all end. Right now, me and my mother are in our rooms, not knowing what to expect. Obviously, my brother down below is still seething. I don't know what he's going to do later... probably verbally abuse and intimidate my mom again...  
  
Obviously, this will be our worst Christmas. We can't even watch TV. For my part, I have two more years before I graduate. I just want to get my life started. I don't want anything traumatizing to stop my life.  
  
Guess I'm looking for advice/support/info about whether people like my brother get violent? How far would they go? Should I fear for our life? What can be done? What is the prognosis for CPTSD? How can I help my mother? I don't want her to spend the rest of her days slaving away in fear. How to cope? What to do...",1,1735023169.0,CPTSDrelationships,0,1.0,False

Am I (28f) overreacting? ,"Obviously it’s Christmas time. My dad (76m) is a notoriously difficult person to gift. Most of the time even he has trouble coming up with ideas for presents, and the ones he does come up with are usually a few hundred dollars or more. 
He was finally able to come up with a list of general ideas for this Christmas, and I was able to get him a few things related to them. Note, the two gifts described in this post are NOT his only presents, he got quite a few others, they’re just not relevant to the story.

In his list, he asked for (amongst others) things from Seaport Village, San Diego, and Star Trek related things. I found a “Find Spock” book (a bit of a novelty gift with a play on Where’s Waldo) and a fiction book about Seaport Village Pirates. I will admit, the latter is NOT what I originally thought when I was ordering. I thought it was going to be a funny little novella/short book - he likes reading, especially very easy reads that you’d find in a middle school library (everyone calls him a big child.) It is indeed a very small, thin book, think what you might read your kid at night before bed. I was forthcoming that it wasn’t what I was expecting, but still thought it was fun and also a bit novelty. 

Shortly after receiving them, he looked over them for a bit, and then made a comment about “well I’ve looked through them, I guess they’re gonna go to Goodwill.” He hadn’t even had them a day. I’m fine with him not being keen on the pirate book, as I said, it wasn’t what I was expecting… but I have two very young nieces (just turned 3 and 2), it seems like it would at least be nicer to say “maybe we should send this to the girls, they’d like it.” The Spock book is pure novelty. It’s a coffee table book. 
It feels important to note he is NOT someone to be anti-clutter/only want stuff around that serves a purpose. We have plenty of things he hasn’t touched since we moved into this house almost 2 years ago and probably won’t touch for another 2. So a novelty gift isn’t a strange choice for him. 

It just really bothers me that I got him presents that felt unique, and his almost immediate reaction was “I don’t want them, I’ll donate them” and say it out loud, to me. I know sometimes people won’t like their presents (I got a few from him I wasn’t exactly excited about), but it’s usual common courtesy to smile, say thank you, and then return/regift/etc. away from the eyes of the gifter. 

Am I overreacting? Was this actually a rude response? It brought up the memory of my mom (no longer alive) who used to talk about how hard he was to gift, because usually his reaction is “this is nice, but I would’ve preferred x.”

TL;DR: I got my dad two novelty gifts (amongst other things) for Christmas, and 
find myself bothered by him saying “I’ve looked at them, I guess I’ll donate them” directly to me afterwards. Am I overreacting or was this actually a rude response?",6,1735022892.0,relationships,8,0.88,False

On one hand, I love the crisp air and snowy landscapes. On the other, I hate the endless layers of clothing that weigh me down. When I came across the **Voltex Heated Vest**, I was intrigued. Could a heated vest actually make winter bearable without the bulk? I decided to try it out, and after several weeks, here’s my experience with it—everything you need to know, without the fluff.

# First Impressions: What Is the Voltex Heated Vest?

The **Voltex Heated Vest** is a sleek, lightweight vest equipped with **NASA-inspired heating technology**. It has **8 heating zones** that focus on keeping your core warm: flanks, waist, mid-back, and neck.

When I first got it, I was impressed by how well it was made. The material feels durable but is still soft and breathable. It’s also designed to be weatherproof, so it works in rain, snow, and windy conditions. The vest doesn’t look like a gadget—it’s simple and stylish, which I liked right away.

# How Does It Work?

The vest is powered by a USB-compatible power bank (not included), which plugs into a port inside the pocket. Operating it is super easy:

1. Plug in the power bank.
2. Hold the power button on the chest for three seconds to turn it on.
3. Choose one of three heat levels:
   * 🔴 **Red (High):** 45°C (113°F)
   * ⚪ **White (Medium):** 35°C (95°F)
   * 🔵 **Blue (Low):** 25°C (77°F)

The heating pads warm up almost instantly, and the vest automatically preheats on high for 5 minutes before switching to medium. This feature is great for when you need to warm up quickly in freezing weather.

# Why I Love the Voltex Heated Vest

**1. Lightweight and Comfortable**  
This vest is incredibly light and doesn’t restrict movement. I wore it while hiking, running errands, and even working from home. It’s perfect as a middle layer under a jacket or as an outer layer on milder days.

**2. Customizable Heat Settings**  
Having three heat levels gives you flexibility. On mildly cold days, I kept it on the low setting, but during freezing mornings, the high setting made a huge difference.

**3. Long Battery Life**  
Using a 10,000mAh power bank, I got about:

* 8 hours on the low setting
* 6 hours on medium
* 3–4 hours on high

This was more than enough for most activities, though carrying an extra power bank might be necessary for extended use.

**4. Weatherproof and Durable**  
I wore the vest in light rain and windy conditions, and it held up perfectly. The material is water-resistant, and the heating system uses water-safe carbon fiber wires.

**5. Machine Washable**  
Cleaning the vest is hassle-free. After unplugging the power bank, I tossed it in the washing machine, and it came out looking brand new.

**6. Stylish and Unisex Design**  
The sleek, minimalist design works for both men and women. The vest comes in sizes ranging from **XXS to 4XL**, so there’s an option for everyone. I’ve even received compliments on how it looks!

# The Downsides

No product is perfect, and the **Voltex Heated Vest** is no exception:

**1. No Included Battery**  
You’ll need your own power bank, which must output at least 5V 2AMP. While I already had one, this might be an inconvenience for some.

**2. Battery Life on High Heat**  
If you’re planning to use the vest on the highest setting for several hours, the battery will drain quickly. Carrying an extra power bank is a good idea for all-day use.

**3. Preheat Phase is Automatic**  
The vest starts with a mandatory 5-minute preheat phase on high before switching to medium. While this is great for a quick warm-up, it would be nice to have the option to skip it.

# Who Is the Voltex Heated Vest For?

This vest is ideal for anyone who spends time outdoors in cold weather. Whether you’re hiking, skiing, camping, or simply running errands, the **Voltex Heated Vest** offers practical warmth without the bulk of heavy layers.

It’s also a great option for people who work in cold environments, like construction workers or delivery drivers. Even for indoor use, it’s a fantastic way to stay warm without cranking up the thermostat.

# Key Features at a Glance

* **8 Heating Zones**: Even warmth across flanks, waist, back, and neck.
* **Three Heat Levels**: Adjust to match your activity and weather.
* **Weatherproof Design**: Windproof and water-resistant.
* **Machine Washable**: Durable enough for regular cleaning.
* **Unisex Sizing**: Available from XXS to 4XL.

# What Surprised Me the Most?

I wasn’t expecting the heating to feel so natural. Unlike heavy jackets that trap your body heat, the **Voltex Heated Vest** actively generates warmth where you need it most. It doesn’t feel overly hot or uncomfortable—it’s just right.

Another surprise was how stylish it looks. Heated vests often have a “techy” vibe, but this one blends seamlessly into any outfit. Whether I’m hiking in the mountains or grabbing coffee outdoors, it looks and feels like a regular vest.

# Final Thoughts: Is It Worth It?

After weeks of using the **Voltex Heated Vest**, I can confidently say it’s been a fantastic addition to my winter gear. It’s lightweight, easy to use, and provides consistent warmth without the bulk of heavy jackets.

While it has a few minor drawbacks, like the lack of an included battery, the overall experience has been overwhelmingly positive. If you’re tired of freezing during the winter or need a reliable way to stay warm for outdoor activities, this vest is definitely worth considering.

This is a breakdown of how I bought tickets and the actual experience (coming from USA).

I got a suica card using my iphone apple wallet, I uploaded about 5,000 yen to it prior to arrival in Japan. My husband has an android phone and couldn’t use this method (theyre more iphone friendly for some reason) so he had to get a physical suica at the airport which there is a line near the bus terminals with someone directing in english so not hard to find! 

Shinkansen: Tokyo to Kyoto
- I downloaded the smartEX app to get tickets about 1 month in advance, if you buy earlier you can actually get discounts on the tickets which will be marked on there. I designated my suica card ID (found in apple wallet card number details)to my ticket once I arrived in Japan which I found in my apple wallet card info area. I designated my husband’s as well. 
- Now I had previously heard that the train platform isn’t announced until like 15min prior to departure which is true for the actual signs in the train station. However, when I googled our route on google maps it actually showed the platform earlier than that which made it easier to navigate the station. It is easier to find your train btw using the train number and type (Nozomi 283) than to look for signs saying kyoto. 
- Tokyo station is big! We gave ourselves 1.5hours to be there and get food and we still ended up rushing to our platform because we waited for a restaurant. 
- To get to the main terminal area you swipe your suica card. Then when you get to the right platform area you swipe your suica card again and get a physical ticket —KEEP THIS 
- There are escalators and elevators to the platform. The train carriages are very easy to find but keep that in mind when giving yourself time that you might need to walk a bit to get to it
- The train really does leave RIGHT on time, like it stopped for all of 6 or so minutes and took right off. 
- We booked the green car D seat to be able to see fuji on the way ( was very easy to see and gorgeous) and the seats were like couches tbh, very comfortable and lots of leg room. They had some small snacks/coffee available in the train that you use a PR code to order but they did not have lunchboxes etc available like they apparently have had in past
- Luggage wise we had two carryons and two backpacks that were easy to store overhead. There are certain seats designated with oversized luggage space and you can also reserve the locked area for luggage near the end of the car where the bathrooms are. 
- We started getting our luggage about 5min prior to arrival and stood by the door to exit quickly. I highly recommend this if you have luggage since again it really doesn’t stop for much longer than the few minutes to get on get off. 
- When you get to your destination station you will exit the terminal by putting in your physical train ticket. We didn’t get it back. 
- 10/10 experience 

Romancecar Odawara to Tokyo
- So there are 3 types of romancecar trains. The newest one is the only one that has a panoramic view which is why I booked this instead of another shinkansen. 
- The newest trains are the GSE trains
- I bought the Romancecar ticket online a month prior (if you want the platform seats at LEAST a month prior to make sure you get good ones and the time of departure you want) 
- website was : https://www.odakyu.jp/english/
- I bought the tickets and got an email detailing the purchase. 
- Now here is where it got confusing, so this purchase was just a reservation for the platform seats, not the actual train ride. Its much cheaper which is the tip off (1900 yen for two people)
- So I went to kyoto train station and swiped our suica to enter then looked for the office that listed odakyu lines information center and asked the staff. They were very helpful! They looked at my email and calculated the fare of our train ride which we paid and gave us a physical ticket. Presumably you can do this at the kiosks outside but I wasn’t quite sure and they helped explain the process better. 
- We then went to the platform area and entered our physical ticket to get access. The platform has the floor marked with the train type (GSE, MSE, etc) and carriage number so you can stand near it to get on quickly. 
- The GSE is a red train so pay attention when you’re entering, there was a blue MSE train we almost accidentally got on because the time was similar. 
- So the seats were comfortable but definitely not Shinkansen level. 
- There was no overhead space obviously in the platform car but there was a small rack at the very beginning of the car that fit our two carryons and other peoples luggage. I had a large backpack that barely fit under the seat. So if you have larger suitcases or lots of luggage I would consider a luggage transport service or the shinkansen as a better option since we barely managed to fit ours. 
- The views are beautiful! You get to see the train tunnels and scenery at a slower pace than the bullet trains so I think it was definitely worth it.

For the first 24 hours, I get constipated, but by the second day my gut changes. I get these farts that smell absolutely rotten, my gut LITERALLY bubbles and all of the sudden I get hot and sweaty, and then I'm legit taking the biggest shit I've ever taken in my life. Like, afterwards, I'm shaking, and have to lay down on the couch and sort of zone out for a bit to process what just happened to me. 

Anyways, this happened to me the other day in a span of half an hour except I was walking to work without the creature comforts of home and I had drank a big cup of coffee (coffee poops are a real thing). I got instant bubble guts, and was hot and sweaty even though it was -15C out. I had to duck into an abandoned parking lot next to Taco Bell (fitting, really) and then proceeded to literally shit my brains out at 5:00 am in the dark in this parking lot. 

This has happened before. After a previous walk to work in the wee hours of the morning when I ate two cobs of corn the evening prior, I literally shit in the same abandoned lot next to Taco Bell and now carry a small package of baby wipes and hand sanitizer in case this exact scenario happens again.

I guess I'm asking if there is a way to bypass this part completely or is it just part of the package?

I live in a small apartment with my boyfriend, my Doberman puppy, Caesar, and my corn snake, Bane. Moving in together has caused our place to feel kinda cramped and I’m not allowed to drill shelves into the walls. Bane’s enclosure takes up a lot of space. Therefore, I’ve been thinking about smart storage and duel purpose furniture.

I used AI to generated this possible enclosure idea, which also functions as a coffee table. I’ve looked at some other custom builds, but can’t find a design like this. Soo I’ve got some questions:

1. Is this idea viable? Cause I haven’t seen anybody else think of this idea. Like, is it possible to make a coffee table enclosure that is comfortable for the snake? 
2. If this idea is not viable, why? Is it because the snake would sense the vibrations when somebody would put their drink down or something?
3. If there are any DIYers, Woodworkers, Tradesmen, or others who have the skills in Canada to build this, how much would it cost? I’d be willing to pay for a beautifully designed and practical furniture piece like this, but not more than 500$ (since I’m a broke uni student). Ideally, I would like the enclosure to the bioactive.

Currently, Bane is living his life in a standard, run-of-the-mill enclosure.

Java Burn Reviews Exposed: Does This Coffee Booster Live Up to the Hype?

Hey fellow coffee enthusiasts! I've been on this Java Burn ride for a while now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my morning routine. Here's my take on it with all the deets you need.

**Java Burn Reviews: Real Talk Time** Alright, so I was skeptical at first, as we all are with these things, right? But after diving into Java Burn reviews, especially on consumer reports, I thought, Why not give it a shot?

**Java Burn Coffee: Elevating My Cup of Joe** So, what's the deal with Java Burn coffee? It's this dissolvable, tasteless packet you throw into your coffee, and bam, you've got this upgraded brew that's supposed to boost metabolism and energy. Intriguing, right?

**Java Burn Ingredients: Nature's Squad Goals** I did my homework on the ingredients – all-natural, vegetarian, gluten-free, and non-GMO. It's got this powerhouse combo that's supposed to set your metabolism on fire. Sounds like my kind of science!

**What is Java Burn? Unveiling the Magic** Java Burn is essentially this mix designed to amp up your metabolism when combined with coffee. It claims to torch fat, reduce hunger, and improve overall health. Bold promises, I know.

**Does Java Burn Work? My Experience** Okay, the million-dollar question. Does Java Burn actually work? For me, I'd say yes. I've been feeling more energized, noticed a bit of a reduction in those mid-morning cravings, and I swear my metabolism's doing a happy dance.

**Java Burn Complaints: Separating Fact from Fiction** Let's address the elephant in the room – complaints. I've seen some gripes, but honestly, most seem like folks not giving it enough time. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a supercharged metabolism.

**Java Burn Customer Reviews: Our Own Coffee Club** Being part of the Java Burn customer community is a trip. Shared my stash with friends, and now they're hooked too. It's like our little secret coffee club, and we're all in on the Java Burn magic.

**What Is in Java Burn? Breaking Down the Wizardry** I won't geek out too much, but the ingredients read like a who's who of metabolism support. If you're into the nitty-gritty, check it out – it's legit.

**Java Burn Scam: Let's Bust Some Myths** Scam or not? I did my digging, and I'm leaning towards not. I mean, I got what I paid for, and my coffee's never been this exciting.

**Reviews on Java Burn: Diverse Perspectives** I don't want you to just take my word for it. Dive into other Java Burn reviews for a broader picture. People's experiences vary, and it's good to get different perspectives.

Java Burn Reviews Exposed: Does This Coffee Booster Live Up to the Hype?

Hey fellow coffee enthusiasts! I've been on this Java Burn ride for a while now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer for my morning routine. Here's my take on it with all the deets you need.

**Java Burn Reviews: Real Talk Time** Alright, so I was skeptical at first, as we all are with these things, right? But after diving into Java Burn reviews, especially on consumer reports, I thought, Why not give it a shot?

**Java Burn Coffee: Elevating My Cup of Joe** So, what's the deal with Java Burn coffee? It's this dissolvable, tasteless packet you throw into your coffee, and bam, you've got this upgraded brew that's supposed to boost metabolism and energy. Intriguing, right?

**Java Burn Ingredients: Nature's Squad Goals** I did my homework on the ingredients – all-natural, vegetarian, gluten-free, and non-GMO. It's got this powerhouse combo that's supposed to set your metabolism on fire. Sounds like my kind of science!

**What is Java Burn? Unveiling the Magic** Java Burn is essentially this mix designed to amp up your metabolism when combined with coffee. It claims to torch fat, reduce hunger, and improve overall health. Bold promises, I know.

**Does Java Burn Work? My Experience** Okay, the million-dollar question. Does Java Burn actually work? For me, I'd say yes. I've been feeling more energized, noticed a bit of a reduction in those mid-morning cravings, and I swear my metabolism's doing a happy dance.

**Java Burn Complaints: Separating Fact from Fiction** Let's address the elephant in the room – complaints. I've seen some gripes, but honestly, most seem like folks not giving it enough time. Rome wasn't built in a day, and neither is a supercharged metabolism.

**Java Burn Customer Reviews: Our Own Coffee Club** Being part of the Java Burn customer community is a trip. Shared my stash with friends, and now they're hooked too. It's like our little secret coffee club, and we're all in on the Java Burn magic.

**What Is in Java Burn? Breaking Down the Wizardry** I won't geek out too much, but the ingredients read like a who's who of metabolism support. If you're into the nitty-gritty, check it out – it's legit.

**Java Burn Scam: Let's Bust Some Myths** Scam or not? I did my digging, and I'm leaning towards not. I mean, I got what I paid for, and my coffee's never been this exciting.

**Reviews on Java Burn: Diverse Perspectives** I don't want you to just take my word for it. Dive into other Java Burn reviews for a broader picture. People's experiences vary, and it's good to get different perspectives.

**Is Java Burn a Scam? Spoiler Alert: Nah** With all the noise about scams, I get the hesitation. But from where I'm standing, Java Burn's delivering the goods without any shadiness.

**Java Burn Coffee Buy Online: My Go-To Move** Ordered mine online – smooth process. Amazon's got it, and it's a convenient way to get your hands on Java Burn without much fuss.

**Java Burns: More Than a Metaphor** Java Burn isn't just about metaphorical fires; it's about igniting that fire within, and for me, it's been a welcomed blaze.

**Is Java Burn Legit? No Smoke and Mirrors** Legitimacy matters, right? Java Burn checks the boxes for me – no weird stuff, quality ingredients, and it's doing what it promised.

**Ingredients in Java Burn: Nature's Toolbox Unveiled** If you're curious about the ingredients, and you should be, check out the Java Burn recipe. It's like nature's toolbox for a kick-ass metabolism.

1hl7kwv,https://www.reddit.com/r/lamedviv/comments/1hl7kwv/mistress_sandy_oversees_sheilas_aka_slave_loser/,"Mistress Sandy Oversees Sheila's (AKA Slave Loser Girl) Penance Part 20. Nora Chastised For Irritating Layla In The Bitch Suit. The Band Girls Meet ""Santa"" For A Fan Service Video. Sexy Elf Sandy And Santa Dave Give A Hardcore Performance. ","Sandy's perspective

I watch as Nora, just a little too gleefully, is  showing poor Slave Border Bunny her Reindeer costume for the Christmas Party. Layla is in her standard bitchsuit, on the floor of the Ready Room, wearing a black gimp hood mask zippered shut over a nerf ball soaked in regular hot sauce stuffed in her pretty mouth. Nora is crouched to her right eagerly showing the grumpy, fed up slave her costume on a tablet. I look to my right. Constance doesn't look happy at Nora's cruel enjoyment of the Hispanic girl's misery, either.

It is a cute costume, Reindeer antlers, a light up red nose, a reindeer tail butt plug, and an adorable reindeer decorated Christmas sweater. The sweater is only supposed to be put on her at her request if she is feeling cold. The plan is for Nora to be in a minature sleigh, Border Bunny harnessed to it. Nora, in a sexy female Santa costume, whips her around the stage to introduce Slaves of Eros for  the studio Christmas party. Border Bunny would sing along with her bandmates, who'd have reindeer antlers and jingle bells on their suits, dancing to either side of her. She had one solo of Rudolph the red nose reindeer.

Poor Layla had been getting the worst of being in the Slavegirl Band. She'd been measured for a slavesuit and it was on order, so she could dance with her team mates to some of the spicy numbers Viv was choreographing for them. But for now she was stuck in a bitchsuit. While Sheila and Vivian tended to get classy online Masters who were nice to them and even spoiled them with gifts, poor Border Bunny attracted rude and even racist assholes, who liked watching a little white girl abuse an older Mexican girl. She bore it with longsuffering, but you could tell she was grouchy and fed up with the abuse. Constance had ended several sessions with overly racist and abusive Masters, refunding their money. Then chewed Nora's ass for not protecting her slave herself. The blondie was learning to lighten her heavy hand with slaves, but so slowly sometimes.

""Zero, Bubblebutt, tend to Border Bunny, get her snacks, water whatever she wants and rub her back down. Bubblebutt, you have my number, call me on the Ready Room phone if you girls need anything. Mistresses Sandy, Nora. Walk with me.""
Constance's stern domme voice brooked no disobedience.

Bubblebutt and Zero are  quietly studying scripts at the table. They are suited, Sheila doesn't  have to wear her hood mask for script readings. The Thicc Viet girl replies ""Sure thing, boss. C'mon Sheila."" The two suited slaves move to tend their bandmate.

Nora had a guilty ""What did I do this time"" look on her face as we walk out a pace behind the stunning black MILF. Constance never mentions it explicitly, but how could Nora forget her ""personal slave"" was the lover of our current supervising Executive Domme? She was there when they bonded from Domme and sub to a couple! I remember Nora telling me Layla was the Domme and Constance the sub, and their relationship reminded her and Sarah of themselves the first season! Did she keep forgetting Constance was watching every screw up she made as a domme that much closer?

""Sugar, has Layla ever done anything to upset or offend you? Done anything you want to get back at her for? It's important you tell me if you have a personal problem with her."" Constance has stopped us near the gym. It is after lunch, so there aren't many people around. She has turned to look steadily at Nora.

Whose sheepish look is  more hangdog by the second. ""Gosh no. She was real nice to me when she first got here, treated me like little sister, even more than Sheila. When she's been stern with me, I really needed it. And she's a great slave, so quiet and obedient, and such a good sport."" ""Especially since fans of the band have dubbed her the ""mascot"" because of the bitchsuit, and she attracts the worst online clients out of the three of the band girls. For the moment, through no fault of her own, her restrictions make her the band bottom bitch. Once her suit comes in I really want to help her get better clients and on a more even footing with the other girls."" Nora sounds sincere, but whenever that beast took over when she dommed another woman....

""I believe you sugar, so you won't mind a couple of rules for the Christmas presentation.  The whip you're going to be using on her is a hybrid that makes a loud crack. I've taught you how to crack it over her without hitting her with it. I know mistakes happen, but remember she sleeps with me now, too many welts on her cute brown butt, there's a reckoning, sugar. You tracking so far?""

Nora gulps. ""Yes, Mistress Constance."" She know this is a school session. ""Good, sugar. Her sweater will be her choice to wear. I assigned Bubblebutt to check in on her, but you better follow up. If she's cold, they put the sweater on her. If she's overheating they take it off. She decides if she wants her breasts out, or covered up, whatever's more comfortable for her. It's HER choice."" Border Bunny's Christmas sweater had cutouts for her breasts, and patches to cover them. It wasn't a torture device but intended to give the band's poor mascot as much comfort as possible.

""But, Mistress Constance, it will look so cute on her..."" Constance fixes her with a dominatrix glare that shuts her up. ""Yes, Mistress Constance."" she mumbles meekly.

Constance smiles and claps her shoulder. ""Glad you understand, sugar. Now there's this new coffee stand that's started up just off set, both you girls like Pumpkin Spice?"" We both chorus yes. ""Great, let me buy you gals a coffee, I already texted Sarah to check on the girls in the Ready Room."" I exchanged glances with Constance as we head to get our coffees. ""Well played."" I mouth. She nods.

It was. No haranguing or lecturing, Nora had had enough of that from all of us. Just letting her know she is being watched as a probationary Domme, but we are trusting her to do the right thing. I hope it is effective at teaching her.

Sheila's perspective

We are doing a slavesuited rehearsal on stage of Mariah Carey's ""All I Want For Christmas is you."" I am to a bitchsuited Layla's right, Vivian to her left. We are turning forward and back, shimmying per Vivian's choreographed dance moves to really showcase our lady parts. Bubblebutt is supervising, but she has her crop holstered, she generally tries to give us more positive encouragement then when the band started. As well as being more concerned about our safety.

Our ""Audience "" is Lara, Constance, Sandy, Nora, Sarah, Jasmine and Ji. I'd specifically polled the other three band members to make sure they were comfortable with Ji attending our rehersrals, they all said they were. Ji wouldn't attend unless they were unanimous, so I was glad they were. I hoped the extra support from most of our friends was as good for Layla as it was for me. I was sad for Cindy and Vivian they didn't have any loved ones to support them like Layla and I. Katie and Jasmine just didn't foster the close friendships we had as the Perseverance crew that made our fetish roles secondary. I know they thought it was odd how easily we switched domme and sub roles among each other the last few years. But I was grateful our personal bonds were the glue that held us together.

I sang the individual lines, Border Bunny and Smelly Cunt back me up on the chorus. It had taken a few rehearsals and crop lashings to get us coordinated, especially throwing in Vivian and I's dance moves. But it seems like we are one badass fetish girl singing machine now.
As I hold out my arms invitingly, exposing my bare breasts, and sing ""all I want for Christmas is youuu"" for the denoumouet, I give a salicious wink to Lara. Lara gives me a dirty wink back. My sweetie and I had some fun private reindeer games planned after the party on Christmas eve....

My sister, girlfriend and friends stand to give us a hearty round of applause. Jasmine sits in her seat, arms crossed and eyes rolling. Who'd clap for a bunch of slaves, I know she is thinking. But even she relents, comes to her feet, and reluctantly claps for our performance.

I hear Cindy's pleasant voice, sounding relaxed and pleased ""Great job, girls, our rehearsals are really helping. I'm proud of all three of you for your patience and hard work. Come to attention girls, we're going to lock you down briefly in your suits. You're not being punished, it just looks like your cooling systems are overheating. We're going to do some diagnostics. Drink as much water as you like, we're going to top off your camelbaks while we're at it.""

I assume the position and feel the familiar buzz of the suit locking me in place.
I suck the tepid but deliciously cool water through my hydration hose as I watch Constance wave Sandy, Nora, Jasmine and Sarah to the stage. Sarah comes toward me, Nora crouches next to Border Bunny, and Jasmine heads for Smelly Cunt. Sandy takes up position behind the three girls, obviously supervising and overseeing them as Constance's Trainee Top Domme. The Boss Bitch in me approves of Costance's choice.

I had really been reluctant to let her domme again, when Nora came to me asking if Sandy could help her domme Sarah. Only Sarah not only consenting but seeming enthusiastic made me relent.

After her performance as my domme, again, I had to  admit she is good at it, with her cruelty curbed and her empathy activated. She is a natural at it, just as I am at subbing, when I consent and my limits are respected. 

My eyes drift to Nora, she'd removed The neck brace and flashing red nose from Border Bunny, and is ågently hydrating and reassuring the bitchsuited girl with a big, cold bottle of water. Slowly but surely my friends were knocking that demon left over from years of abuse out of her, and teaching her to domme properly. We shouldn't have pushed her so hard into a leadership role she wasn't ready for. I'd just presumed that since she never hurt Sarah, she was safe to have other subs. When she started seriously abusing Mary for little real reason, I should have removed Mary from her care, even if it risked the whole production.

Oh well, I'd paid for my mistakes as a leader. It was nice to relax into and actually enjoy my new role as a sub, letting my Sweetie and Constance run things for awhile. Bubblebutt's voice broke in ""Okay girls, change of plans. We're going to do the Jingle Slut skits now. Mistress Sandy will take you to the set, Mistress Jasmine and Alpha Sara will help you out of the suits.""

The Jingle Slut Skits were fan service videos with all four of us in lighter outfits then the slavesuits. Green and red fishnet half body stockings that ran up to our waists and left nothing really covered. Snowflake choker necklaces, stocking caps, and nothing else. I reflected it was a nice break for Bubblebutt, Smelly Cunt and I. And poor Layla must be really happy to get out of the bitchsuit.

Speaking of which, Bubblebutt tells  her  ""Layla, dear. I know you're under a lot of strain in the bitchsuit. If you want to be excused and rest, I talked to our dommes. After you're out of the bitchsuit, Mistress Lara will take you to Mistress Constance's suite so you can recover. They assure me it's no trouble dear."" 

The Marine Girl gamely replies ""No need, Alpha Cindy. I'm fine. Get me out of this thing so I can support my teamates."" Bubble Butt says ""Thank you for being a Team Player, Slave Border Bunny."" Nora pats her approvingly.

My approval of Nora's behavior plummets as I feel the buzz of the suit unlocking so I can move again. She looks sneakily around to make sure Constance and Sandy aren't looking. Then she puts Border Bunny's neck brace back on, and tethers her to a bolt on the deck with a dog collar and leash. What becomes too much is  when she puts the red lighted nose back on the poor creature and sets it to blink. It is obviously irritating Layla's eyes, but there is  not a thing she can do about it Nora just giggles at the poor Mexican girl.
I walk up behind them and muster my Boss Bitch voice. ""Nora Jameson."" I say sternly. She jumps and looks back at me guiltily. She knows she messed up. She quickly shuts off the nose light and takes it off Layla. ""Uh, I was just funning her a little, Miss Connor. You're ok, aren't you, honey buns?"" She makes a show of petting Border Bunny's head soothingly. The long suffering Marine girl still looks mad. But she gamely states ""I'm ok, no harm done, Miss Connor, Mistress Nora."" I turn and walk to follow my sister to the Jingle Slut set. Being submissive seems to be better for me, but nice to know I can still put an erring girl in check with my Boss voice.

Layla's perspective Jingle Slut set

The set is set up as a big bed that all three of the Slaves Of Eros Betas sleep in together for the skit. We'd all changed into our Christmas half body stockings with little jingle bells around the waist and our stocking caps. The skit starts with all the three of us lined up by the bed, Cindy telling us to get some rest for our studio Christmas Party performance tomorrow. She walks back and forth in front of our bare titted girl formation, slapping a crop in her hand, wearing the same outfit we are. She warns us that any horseplay will be severely punished.  We dutifully say in unison ""Yes, Alpha Cindy.""

We pretend to snuggle into bed together and sleep. As soon as we're sure Alpha Cindy is gone we start pillow fighting. We're told to improvise the fight, but the fans expect a lot of girlish giggling and jiggling. Vivian is built similarly to me, so we can exchange some solid pillow blows without hurting each other. Sheila is strong fit, but the smallest of us, both Vivian and I realize we could knock her over with a solid strike. We position Sheila slightly back and between us on the bed, giving the camera a full frontal of her breasts, while Viv and I face each other to give a good side boob view to our fans. We do most of the fighting, with Sheila lightly hitting both of us to look like she's participating. It's so absurd that Sheila and I exchange looks and don't have to fake giggling. Even Viv cracks a nice smile, she's normally so stone faced and serious. This is the first time I'm actually enjoying this undercover slave gig.

Viv and I knock each other's stocking caps off several times. Sheila is a good sport, retrieving them for us. She knows we're trying to keep from hurting her because she's the most petite, and can see it's a sensible precaution. Then Alpha Cindy comes in and yells ""You naughty girls! I tell you to get some rest, and you have a pillow fight, what do you have to say for yourselves!"" It's total improv, but Sheila pipes up with ""Uh, Alpha Cindy, we're fetish band slaves, we're supposed to be naughty."" I can't suppress a chuckle, even Viv tries to hold back laughter. It is good to see Sheila getting her smart assness back.

""Shut up, you little smart ass! The three of you kneel facing the bed in a row, I'm going to crop your adorable little butts cherry red"" that's my cue to move forward and knock the crop out of Alpha Cindy's hand with a pillow swing. The other two girls act like they're hesitating, then we all pile on Cindy.

We force her face down on the floor, I straddle her back, pinning her arms with my knees. I lock both hands under her chin and pull her head up in a Camel clutch. Vivian pins her legs when she tries to kick her heels back at me. Sheila picks up the pillow and whacks her big sexy MILF butt a few times. Then I hear the elder Connor sister exclaim. ""Forget the pillow, I'm going to crop her ass!""

Just then we hear Nora yell ""What are you doing to your Alpha, you bad, bad girls!"" We look up to see Nora glaring at us, flanked to the left by Sarah, and the right by Jasmine. They're wearing thigh high domme black domme boots, black short skirts, grey military blouses and peaked caps. They look no nonsense with their crops in two handed grips in front of them. Still our rebellious group of slaves glares back in defiance at the trio of dommes.

Nora says ""We have a special visitor, just for you girls. But I don't think you deserve to see him now."" Just then a shrill girly voice pipes in ""Not so fast, Mistress Nora, Daddy is a big fan of the girls, he came all the way from the North Pole just to see them!"" Please Mistresses, make an exception, this once?"" That voice sounds like...Sandy?

The junior Connor sister comes skipping in the room wearing a skimpy elf costume. Pointed green slippers, candy cane striped stockings, a green skirt that flips up as she skips, showing she's going commando. She wears a red midriff bearing top, a stupid clown smile grease painted on her face. Topped off with a stocking cap similar to ours.

I look at my two fellow slaves, who look as shocked as I feel. No suprise we weren't told everything. But glancing back at our dommes, they look taken aback, as well. Were they not told, either?

Finally Jasmine speaks, her genuine animosity towards Sandy ooozing out. ""Who the fuck are you supposed to be, bitch?"" She snaps. Sandy laughs off Jasmine's obvious hostility. ""Mistress Jasmine, you silly, I'm Sandy the Sexy Elf!""
Then she turns to face us. ""Girls, do you know who your special visitor is?""

Vivian and I have gotten off of Cindy, and Sheila has helped her up. She is brushing off the older Vietnamese girl, asking if anything hurt, and checking her for bruises. Good old softie Sheila, always looking out for others. Anyway we did know this question was coming, if not from whom. And Alpha Cindy had drilled us on how we were supposed to react. Our, eyes get big, and we start bouncing up and down on our feet so our breasts jiggle. We exclaim ""SANTA!"" in unison, in our most high pitched, excited voices.

""That's right, girls! Daddy-I mean Santa, loves that you're so naughty, that's why he's a fan! Mistresses, he really hopes you'll stay on his nice list and let him see them.""

Nora, obviously the dommes' leader, for this little skit, makes a show of calling her subordinate dommes into a whispering huddle. This seems scripted and planned. After a few moments, they break the huddle, and Nora says ""Oh, alright. If it's that important to Santa, he can see them. We're still going to punish the insouciant little bitches later."" Another scripted Dommes versus Subs glare off ensues.

Sandy chirps ""Great! Daddeee...they say you can come visit the girls now!"" Then she giggles at us ""He's so excited to finally meet his favorite girl band!"" When Santa comes in we're in for another shock. It takes a moment to recognize him under the fake beard...but it's Dave! What...The...Actual...Fuck?

""Ho, Ho, Ho girls, Merry Christmas! I've got goodies for four very special, very pretty girls!"" He tosses each of the four of us a stuffed stocking with our first names stitched on them in green lettering. A quick glance shows they contain candy, nuts,and some expensive lady's soaps and shampoos.

Sarah and Jasmine bring in a red chair and Dave-Santa sits down. We were expecting this, we were reassured we wouldn't be expected to have sex with ""Santa"", just sit in his lap and exchange comic dialogue.

Alpha Cindy discretely collects our stockings and hands them to Sarah, who breaks character to assure us we'll get them back after the shoot.

Vivian goes first, and she's supposed to pull a dumb blonde act. She was told she didn't have to if she didn't want to, which made Jasmine and Katie look mad. Tough girls, our turf, our rules. But Viv decided to be a good sport and play along.

Vivian sits on his lap and says ""Santa?"" in a high, ditzy voice. He replies ""Yes, Sweetheart?"" She says ""Does Christmas fall on a Friday this year?"" He looks a little bewildered. ""No sweetie, a Wedensday."" She goes on obliviously ""If it falls on a Friday, I hope it's not the 13th."" He looks really befuddled. ""Dear, is there something I can do for you?"" Now Viv looks serious. In her normal voice she says ""My family hasn't heard from me in awhile, could you let them know I'm safe and not being forced to do what I do now?"" Now Dave looks gravely serious. ""Sure, young lady, let me know who you want contacted and I'll make it happen."" She leans forward to whisper in his ear. He nods, and they share a sincere hug before she gets off his lap.

Sheila is next. He gets a smug smirk as she settles on his lap and puts an arm around her waist. She leans forward to whisper in his ear. I can bet with Sheila it's something along the lines of, ""Dave you prick, you're enjoying this too much."" His smirk gets bigger and he winks at her. ""And what would you like, young lady?"" He asks her.

She looks at Nora. ""Mistress Nora to shave her pubic hair better, it gets stuck in my teeth when she makes me go down on her."" Nora flushes and looks down, as we all, dommes and subs, share a laugh at her expense. Sarah claps her Mistress on the shoulder and smilingly tells her Sheila does have a point. No secret Sarah and Nora dive each others muffs a lot, so she'd know.

Sheila quickly gets off his lap, though he gets in a quick smack on her fishnet clad ass that makes her look annoyed. My turn. I settle on Dave's lap, he puts an arm around my waist, I can feel a rock hard object in his pants poking my bottom. ""Gee Dave, is that a pistol you're packing, or are you just happy to see me?"" He gives me his signature wink. ""Come now, young lady, you love sexy women as much as I do, can you blame me?"" When he puts it that way, he has a point, I can't really blame him. I wouldn't mind a scantily clad Sheila or Viv on my lap personally, I just don't have a boner to give me away.

""And what would you like, young lady?"" No need to think hard about that. ""Get me out of that stupid bitchsuit, at least when the band is performing."" Dave's look gets serious. ""The Christmas Party is the last time you'll have to perform in it. Your slavesuit will be here the day after Christmas, you'll wear that whenever you girls entertain. The fans actually like you as the band mascot. But I don't care, you deserve better than that, sweetheart."" He gives me a squeeze with the arm around my waist, meant to be friendly, not sexual. I remember why, for all his faults, us girls are loyal to this misogynist prick. He genuinely cares about our well being.

I place a hand on his chest, and whisper a sincere thank you. ""No, problem for my lovely young Marine."" Before I hop off his lap, I warn him ""Slap my butt and I break your hand, buster. Even if you are the big boss man."" His eyes twinkle with amusement but he doesn't give my ass the smack he gave Sheila's as I push off.

Then Dave gestures to Cindy. ""Don't be shy pretty young lady, come sit on Santa's lap.""
Cindy blushes and seems kind of demure, though pleased to be called a ""Pretty young lady."" She reluctantly comes forward and gets on his lap. He pats her reassuringly on the back as she whispers something in his ear. He nods gravely again and pats her back as she quickly hops off his lap. 

Sarah comes forward and gently touches Sheila's arm. ""No big concern, but the nurse wants to give you a brief check up when she saw the chart of your vitals in the suit. The video is wrapping up, so now is a good time."" Sheila looks baffled, but one good thing about Nora's Tutelage is she is quicker to obey without arguing when one of us is in charge of her. Sarah had brought her robe, she helps her into it, then gently leads her out to the studio sickbay. Sarah scoops up Sheila's stocking from a table she put them on as she passes.

""As you see these naughty girls still got their visit from Santa. But there's still one naughty girl who wants something from Santa. Me!"" Sandy's declaration has us slaves baffled, though Nora and Jasmine smirk at her knowingly. Dave gets up from the chair and gently leads Sandy to the bed. He lays back and unzips himself, Sandy hikes up her skirt, straddles Dave, and expertly guides him into her. Oh My--! Dave and Sandy were actually going to fuck on camera? I thought nothing could suprise me in this business...but this? No wonder they made an excuse and had her best friend take Sheila off the set. Sheila got twisted up if she saw Sandy and Dave holding hands-this would make her flip!

I felt a light touch on my left shoulder and saw Nora holding up a pair of her homemade padded ziptie handcuffs. ""Help me tie her hands behind her back. She knows, it's part of the script.We domme her while she fucks Master Henson."" I look at her kind of dubiously, I am still pissed at how she giggled about irritating me with that stupid light up nose when I was stuck in the bitchsuit. I wasn't sure I wanted to do anything with her at the moment.

She read my look and pleaded. ""Please Layla, I'm sorry about the Rudolph Nose. You'll have fun once we get into it. Pleeaaaze?"" Now she seems like that sweet, good kid I couldn't say no to. I nod and she looks really pleased. I move to the right of the couple on the bed , Nora to the left.

Sandy has her hands braced on ""Santa's"" Red Clad upper thighs, head back moaning and gasping. She doesn't resist at all when I grab her right, Nora her left, slip her wrists through the padded cuffs and tighten them. Nora slaps her bare ass below where her skirt is hiked up. ""You dirty little elf! If you're going to be a little slut, at least be good at it! Pump harder."" Another smack. Sandy moans loudly and buvks harder on her man.

I clap a hand over her mouth and her eyes drift  to me with an adorable suprised squeal. ""Don't look at me, whore! Show me how you suck dick, Sandy Suck Slut!"" I holler. I stick my right index finger in her mouth, she closes her eyes and starts sucking eagerly, like it is a real dick. She makes the cutest mmmm-hmmm sounds, no doubt imagining her mouth around a big dick.

Nora said, ""Thats hot, but I'm going to smack her butt. Might want to take your finger out of her mouth so you don't get bitten."" Sandy seems reluctant to let my finger go, but the adorable cry of shock when Nora slaps her ass is worth it. Nora slaps her left ass cheek, I slap her right, while we berate her as a slutty little elf not worthy to fuck Santa.

Nora yells ""Line up for a whack girls. Mistress Jasmine first, Alpha Cindy second, Slave Smelly Cunt last."" Our remaining ""co-stars"" line up dutifully to smack Sandy Suck Slut's sexy ass. Each smack makes her squeal louder. Viv gives  her a hard wallop, and her head tilts up to the ceiling with a loud ""Ooooh, oooooh, aaaaah!"" She is climaxing. If I judge Daves breathing right, he is, too.

I was suprised at how calmly Dave said ""Roll her off, ladies."" I helped Nora do just that with Sandy, sitting her on the edge of the bed as Dave zipped up. Sandy tries to stand, and looks irritated when Nora forces her to sit with by placing her hands on Sandy's shoulders. 

I comment ""You know Sheila's going to flip when he sees you banging Sandy on video."" I told Dave. ""We thought that would be easier to deal with then if she had been in the room."" I imagined the chaos that would ensue once their intent became clear, and had to agree. He checked his phone. ""Ah, Sheila's check up is finished, Lara and Sarah are helping her unpack her stocking in the Ready Room. You ladies are joining them, you're all off the rest of the day. Jasmine, Nora, Sandy fetch the ladies the sweats I brought in for them. Make sure they don't forget their stockings and escort them to the Ready Room. Free rest of the day, girls. If you want to be escorted to Constance's quarters to sleep, that's fine, Layla. We have guest quarters available if you want to sleep as well, Cindy and Vivian. But I do hope you'll socialize in the Ready Room, you can request movies and I'll have the kitchen fix you all a good holiday meal."" He pulled off his beard and kisses the sitting, cuffed Sandy on the forehead. ""I'll be down to check up on you girls later, so try to keep the fun PG-13, we've done enough porn for one day."" Sandy gives him her usual sappy, in love look as he walks out.

Then she tries  to stand again as she says ""Nora, get these cuffs off me. Jasmine, get the sweats and pass them out. Girls, Get dressed, grab your stockings, and follow us down to the Ready Room."" Nora casually shoves Sandy back into a sitting position on the bed. She says ""You know, Miss Bossy Girl, I like you tied up and submissive. Maybe I'll keep you that way, for awhile.""

She looks like she is fixing to jump up and headbutt Nora. I knew Sandy was a dirty fighter in high school, and Nora, by her own admission, had never been in a real f ight in her life. Even with her hands tied, she could probably injure an unwary Nora. Time to nip this in the bud.

""Quit screwing around, Nora. You know Dave is going to be mad if you domme his sweetie without permission, and we know you don't have it. Free her hands and lets head downstairs."" Nora looks about to say something haughty to rebuff me, looks at my face, and thinks better of it. She asks Jasmine for a boxcutter as Viv and I help Sandy stand up. Once Nora cuts her hands free we massage circulation back into her arms. The three dommes give us sweats and patiently waited for us to get out of our body stockings. When we are dressed, Jasmine hands each of us our stockings, then we trudge beside our Mistresses to join Lara, Sarah and Sheila.

The last couple of years the Kent farm had been a place of peace and tranquility. Clark had learned the importance of this haven. It was where he had spent his childhood, and now it was where he had chosen to build his family with Lana. Jonathan and Martha bought the house Lana grew up in, right next door. Their close presence was much appreciated by Lana and Clark. Now too old to work on the farm, but happy to be so close to their grandchildren, Jonathan and Martha were frequent visitors at the Kent farm.

Married for ten years, Clark and Lana had two children—Julian, their energetic and curious 8-year-old son, and Emily, their beautiful and playfull 4-year-old daughter. Both of them Have dark brown, almost black hair, and a striking resemblance with their parents. Julian looks like what an 8 year old Clark would've looked like, but with hazel eyes like his mother. Emily already is a stunning little girl with her hair in a ponytail most of the time. She has bright blue eyes and Lana's smile. Their lives were filled with love, laughter, and the constant reminder that no matter the challenges, they had each other. Everything was just....right.


÷


It was a crisp December morning on the Kent farm, with the sun just beginning to rise over the horizon, painting the sky in warm oranges and pinks. Because of snowy weather the past couple of days, the farm was looking even more christmassy. Everything was covered with a thick carpet of snow. Clark, dressed in a plaid shirt and faded jeans, stood on the porch, his hands wrapped around a steaming cup of coffee. He was watching the world wake up, savoring the peacefulness of Christmas eve morning.

The farm was decorated in its usual understated style — a few lights strung up around the barn and the house, a modest wreath on the front door, and a snow-covered tree just outside. He could hear Emily around the corner, she was very eager this morning to go outside and play in the fresh snow. Clark smiled to himself, breathing in the cold air.

His reverie was interrupted by the unmistakable sound of laughter behind him. He turned to see Lana standing in the doorway, wrapped in a cozy red scarf and her favorite oversized sweater.

“Careful, Clark,” she teased, “If you stay out here too long, you’ll freeze into a Clark-shaped popsicle.""

Clark chuckled and stepped inside, giving her a tender kiss on the lips while pulling her gently towards him. “Morning, beautiful. Everything’s ready for the big day?”

Lana grinned. “You know me, everything’s in place. Except for one thing.” She raised an eyebrow playfully.

Clark looked at her, confused. “What’s that?”

“Emily’s convinced that Santa is going to drop by the house and have dinner with us tonight,"" Lana said with a smirk. “She’s already left a plate of cookies on the kitchen counter… and a glass of milk… and a carrot for the reindeer.”

Clark raised his hands in mock surrender. “I swear, I didn’t put her up to it.”

He glanced over at the staircase just as he heard the familiar sound of stomping feet. A moment later, Julian came running down the stairs, still wearing his pajamas. His wavy hair was a bit wild, and his face was full of excitement.

“Dad! Dad! You won’t believe it!” Julian said breathlessly, practically vibrating with energy.
“Santa’s sleigh is coming tonight! I saw it in the sky last night, and I swear I saw reindeer!”

Clark blinked, wondering if his son had inherited his imagination or his powers. “You sure about that?”

Julian nodded seriously. “Yes! I saw it through my telescope! And then I heard reindeer hooves on the roof, and I knew it was Santa! He’s coming, Dad!”

Lana raised an eyebrow. “Uh-huh. Did you also happen to see a sleigh parked in the barn?”

Julian shook his head. “No… but maybe he just made it invisible like you sometimes do, Dad!”

Clark froze. He wasn’t sure if he was more impressed by his imagination or concerned that his secret was going to be discovered by his son in a very unexpected way. Did he saw him superspeeding? He couldn't yet trust the children with his secret. They might brag about it to a teacher or to their friends. He knew that, when they got old enough, he would eventually tell them.

Before he could even respond to his son, a high-pitched voice came from outside. “Mom! Dad! I made a snowman outside, and it’s taller than me! It has a scarf, and a hat, and a carrot nose just like the one i got for the reindeer! You should come and see it!”

Clark and Lana both turned to see their 4-year-old daughter, Emily, standing in the doorway. She was holding her teddy bear, her cheeks rosy from the cold, and her brown hair was tied up in a messy ponytail. They followed Emily outside to look at the snowman.

It was a sad little pile of snow with one eye looking upward, the other one downward and the carrot on a rather questionable location.

“Santa will love your snowman.” Lana said with a smile. Trying not to laugh too hard while looking at Clark.

“Yay!” Emily squealed and then promptly ran back inside the house.

Lana and Clark shared a look, their hearts swelling with love for their children. It was hard to believe that their little family had grown so much. They had their share of challenges, of course, but moments like these — the simple, everyday joys of being together — made it all worth it.

“Want to get started on breakfast?” Lana asked, pulling Clark out of his thoughts.

“Sure,” Clark replied.

As they both walked back to the house they couldn't help but cast a smile at eachother.


÷


Later that day Clark, dressed in a festive red sweater, was standing over the stove, stirring a pot of mashed potatoes. Cooking was something he picked up recently and really enjoyed doing. Luckily he had already improved his skills. More than once the family was forced to take out food when one of Clark's ""experiments"" had gone wrong.

Lana, meanwhile, was in the livingroom carefully arranging ornaments on the tree with Emily perched on her hip, chattering about how ""Santa would be so proud of our tree"" and whether or not Rudolph would be able to find their farm, considering it was ""so far out in the middle of nowhere."" 

In the distance, Jonathan and Martha were finishing up their own preparations for the holiday. They were going to spend christmas eve with Clark and Lana. Jonathan had insisted on making his famous apple cider—he’d gotten the recipe from his grandmother, and Martha had quickly backed him up on his insistence. After all, it was a Christmas eve tradition.

""Everything looks perfect,"" Lana said as she walked back into the kitchen, still holding Emily. ""I can’t believe how quickly the kids have grown"" she said while she looked at her daughter ""Emily's already four and Julian's nearly nine!""

Clark grinned as he added a dollop of butter to the mashed potatoes. ""Yeah, it seems like just yesterday we were chasing after them when they could barely walk. Now Emily is out there building snowmen like she's some kind of Arctic architect.""

Lana bursted into laughter. ""I love this time of year. It's so... magical. It reminds me of when we were kids. You know, the Kent farm was always full of life. I always enjoyed being here.""

Clark's eyes softened, and he set the spoon down. ""I love it too. I’m just glad we get to do it together, with the kids, and—"" He stopped,...

The doorbell rang.

""That’s odd,"" Lana said. She put down Emily and walked to the door answer it. ""It's way too early for your parents to be here""

Opening the door, she was greeted by the sight of Oliver Queen—dressed in a full Santa Claus costume, complete with a big white beard and a bag of wrapped gifts slung over his shoulder.

""Oliver? What on earth are you doing?"" Lana asked, a mixture of surprise and amusement in her voice.

Oliver grinned broadly. ""Ho ho ho, Merry Christmas!"" he bellowed, and then promptly sneezed as the cold air hit him. ""Uh, yeah... We were driving by and thought, 'Hey, what’s more Christmasy than surprising my favorite Smallville family with some gifts and holiday cheer?'""

Behind him, Chloe stepped out of the car, chuckling. ""Well, he tried to resist the impulse, but honestly, once he put on that suit,... You know him... he kind of became an honorary elf.""

Lana looked over at Clark, who had wandered over to the door, scratching the back of his head. He raised an eyebrow. ""Oliver, really? Santa Claus? You couldn’t have just called ahead?""

Oliver shrugged, his smile unwavering. ""Why call ahead when you can make a grand entrance?""

Emily, who had been standing behind her mom, peeked her head around Lana’s legs and gasped. ""Santa?! I knew you would come! See mom, i told you so"" she said with a smirk.

""How did she know?"" Lana asked herself.

Oliver immediately crouched down to her level, his deep voice taking on a friendly, booming quality. ""Ho ho ho! Well, well, little lady. Have you been good this year?""

Emily nodded eagerly, her ponytail bouncing with every movement. ""I have! I’ve been really good! I even helped Mom bake cookies for you!""

Oliver glanced at Lana. ""You’ve been baking cookies? But I didn’t smell any out there.""

Lana shot him a wink. ""Well, I may have hidden a few for later.""

Chloe stepped forward, shaking her head with her typical smile. ""Well, we couldn’t just show up empty-handed, could we? We’ve got gifts for the little ones.""

""Thank you!"" Julian shouted excitedly, who came running towards the surprise guests. He tugged on Oliver’s coat. ""Are there presents for me too, Santa? I saw you last night through my telescope, you were going really fast!""

Oliver grinned. ""Of course! Every good boy gets a present from Santa."" He rummaged through the sack, pulling out two brightly wrapped gifts and handing them to the kids. ""One for Julian, and one for Emily. But, and this is important, you have to make sure to leave cookies out for Santa later. Or else, I might end up giving you... socks.""

Emily gasped in mock horror. ""Not socks!""

Lana laughed. ""I think we can make room for some cookies, and you could even stay for dinner if you like"" She glanced at Clark, who was now leaning in the doorway with an amused expression. ""Well, it looks like we’ve got quite the surprise visitor tonight. Come in, both of you.""

Oliver grinned and walked into the house, Chloe following close behind. ""We didn’t want to miss out on a Christmas Eve in Smallville. And we figured you guys could use a some extra holiday vibes.""

Lana closed the door behind them and they all moved into the living room, where the Christmas tree stood proudly in the corner. The fire crackled in the fireplace, casting a warm glow over the room. Martha and Jonathan had just finished up next door and were heading over, carrying enough cider to keep the party going for days.


÷


The evening proceeded with the usual holiday charm. The kids were practically bouncing off the walls as they tore into their gifts, their excitement filling the room. Clark and Lana exchanged fond glances, watching their children revel in the moment.

""I swear, I’ve never seen Julian so happy,"" Lana said, while she sat herself down on Clark's lap.

""He’s a good kid,"" Clark agreed. ""And Emily’s got the energy of a thousand suns.""

""Like father, like daughter,"" Lana teased, leaning into him.

""The turkey!"" Clark yelled all of a sudden, his voice filled with panic.

Lana looked over at him, a bit confused. ""What about the turkey?""

""The turkey!"" Clark repeated. He jumped up. Lana almost losing her balance, but just managed to stay on het feet.

""I was supposed to check it an hour ago, and now—"" He said while running hastly into the kitchen.

Everyone in the room stopped talking. The festive mood came to a screeching halt. They all waited for Clark to give notice. The silence lasted way too long. After some stumbling around in the kitchen, he finally came out, carrying a huge turkey in a roasting pan.

""It's perfect!"" He said with a big Clark-smile on his face. ""I set a timer for the oven, but i forgot i did so.""

""Dinner's ready!"" Lana said, and as she got up so did everybody else.


÷ 


The Kent family and their long time friends gathered around the large wooden table. The warm glow of candles casting a soft light over the shiny cutlery. At the head of the table Clark was carving the turkey like a true masterchef. Julian and Emily giggled while being served mashed potatoes by Lana. Jonathan and Martha were beaming with pride, and Chloe and Oliver shared smiles and stories. The aroma of the turkey hung in the air as everyone dug in. The warmth and love of friends and family filled the room, on that cozy Christmas evening in Smallville.


Happy holidays everybody!!  
Hope you enjoyed it!

Hello all you happy people!

I posted this on another sub and someone suggested I put it here as well. 

I will start by saying, I am a wheelchair user.  Even though I am confined to a chair when I leave my apt, I treasure what little independence I have and strive to do as much as I can on my own. 

This morning, being smack dab in between a snowstorm and Christmas , I had to venture out for a few last minute things. We had a blizzard on Saturday so I don't think I have to say how very much our sidewalks suck right now even though  I know the crews are doing their best to clear things up.  Between snowbanks blocking the entrances, huge pools of ice covering the whole sidewalk in places, and piles of slush, its a fun filled  navigation nightmare lol. So I was forced to give up and use the roads and try and stick to the bike lanes. Trust me, if I could have stayed home I would have! 

So, there I  was, making my way down the road . Trust me, I  am easy to spot lol. I was doing my thing, and some random bitch decided to lean out her car window and scream at me, asking if I were fucking crazy. Like bitch, I'm just trying to get home without dying, I don't need you piling on with your ignorance of the situation. Maybe try and look atound and notice whats happening before you scream at a rando in a wheelchair. Merry fucking Christmas to you too, Karen!
