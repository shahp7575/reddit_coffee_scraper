1jqjf7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Moccamaster/comments/1jqjf7f/filters_cd_grande015t/,Filters CD Grande-015T,"Hello fellow coffee lovers!

I am about to run out of my Moccamaster branded filters. Wondering if anyone has suggestions on alternative filters that are available for this particular brewer?

I've seen some older posts about Kalita (can't find anywhere online with 27 in stock), as well as reading that Filtropa manufactures the Moccamaster branded filters. When I have attempted to search Filtropa for this size I cannot find them. Has anyone created a spreadsheet or list of which filters fit which machines and where they can be found?

I prefer not to pay $86 for eBay Kalita 27 filters because they appear out of stock everywhere! I'm looking to maximize my cost per filter without sacrificing quality of coffee... 

Help is appreciated! ",1,1743689345.0,Moccamaster,0,1.0,False
1jqjevd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqjevd,Long post. I’m new and need advice. Shocker.,". I’m having a hard time creating an additional package not because I can’t, but I don’t want to. It would seem that if I take anything out of what I do currently than the service would be less. I have a mindset of high expectations, it’s just the way that I am so for me to have to create multiple packages with multiple pricing skipping out on things seems slack. On top of  going to these people‘s houses pulling out my waiter Slip and remember who wanted the steak who wanted a cheeseburger and who wanted surf and turf sounds like an aggravation. But I’m finding I’m spending between five and six hours doing an interior and exterior clean vehicles even on sedans that have never had it before or it’s been a a long amount of time. Some of these vehicles have had pet hair in them so it takes longer to try to get all of it out which Ive talked about in my previous post. 

My pricing although competitive and adjusted for my experience and time on my website I have alloted for these vehicles seems not realistic now that I’ve done a couple because I get there and it seems clean ir average but because I’m hitting every nook and cranny and door jam and everywhere in between, it just takes so long! but everyone is extremely satisfied  LOL i’ve not even been able to offer anything much more because I don’t have things like an extractor, I just got a steamer, but I haven’t used it just yet since I just got it, I can’t do waxes or ceramic or any of the fancy stuff yet this is just basic stuff and I know Its subjective about you don’t need this or you don’t need that but in theory I can’t do anything ““ fancy with stains and such so I worry, it’ll take even longer. I dont Want to do vehicles in 5 min and you can’t rush doing things the right way, but also time is money.

So my question for the group is, is it worth it to have multiple packages? Do you see anything on my list that should be an up charge?  and I’m going to assume I’m doing things the “right” way based on things I see here in other places that it just takes a significant amount of time because you’re “detailing”",1,1743689322.0,Detailing,0,1.0,False

Like it says in the title, I’m hoping to find people to talk to during the day. It can get quiet and lonesome, and I love getting to know new and interesting people!

By no means do you have to be Jewish, I just put that in there since I live in an area with few other Jews, so it’s nice to connect with other members of the tribe. Happy to talk to people who are curious about it too, but I am by no means an expert. 

I’m a nerd in general , so feel free to talk nerdy to me, but my interests are broad and I can get into anything anyone else is passionate about. Science, philosophy, creative writing, gaming, working out, photography, cooking, F1 - these are all on the table to name just a few. 

I’m the kind of guy that savours his morning coffee, likes to do the crossword or wordle between sips, and enjoys those quiet moments. It would be nice to share those moments with another person. 

I am a fan of playful banter, shameless flirting and being an all around degenerate, but that’s not the main goal of this post. I am open to seeing where things go, but let’s take it slow, okay?

Interested in making friends with anyone, and open to more depending on how we vibe. Tell me how you like your coffee (or tea), or the last meal you made that you were proud of! Feel free to use chats or messages. Hope to hear from some of you soon!

I’m not gonna give you a ten paragraph breakdown about the meta, what to do, what not to do, or my general observations. None of it is gonna be much different to the other posts in that vein; if you want something in-depth, those resources are already there.

Instead, my advice is simple - you play better when you’re relaxed and having a bit of fun with it. The self-destructive nature of continuing to load a comp game whilst on a losing streak, in the hope your luck will turn, is gonna hurt you far more than bad teammates or boring metas will. At some point on the grind, i went on a 9(!) game losing streak. But i kept loading in. Out of frustration and stubbornness mostly, but I realised at some point that I was just throwing. My confidence was hit, and it was a spiral that I could have avoided. The stress of another loss will be on your mind, and you will play worse as a result.

The next day, every time I found myself getting frustrated, or had lost two in a row, I’d make a coffee, listen to some music, and then when I came back, I would load not in to Comp, but Supremacy or Iron Banner. I would get used to the feeling of winning again. And I would keep doing that until I was back in a relaxed, confident mindset before finally loading back into Comp. Some days, I wouldn’t load into it at all if I felt I wasn’t able to maintain a relaxed and confident mood whilst playing it.

After that, the points kept stacking, until I got it. You gain nothing by repeatedly beating your head against a wall. Relax, breathe, get your confidence back, and only then do you go again.",2,1743689011.0,CrucibleGuidebook,0,1.0,False

1jqj69g,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jqj69g/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/,"My coworker and I were looking for the storage closet, but got a staircase instead (Part 1)","I don’t think I’ve told anyone this story actually. My partner has been pushing me to now that we're trying to find these people, but I thought I'd only have to relive this in my dreams. I hope none of you ever find one of the doors, for everyone's sake.



I was 22. The fast-food life wasn't the way I had imagined I’d spend my time on this Earth, but there I was on the way back to the golden arches after the sixth 7-1 am shift that pay period. My apron hadn’t been washed and I was ready to throw in the towel- though that was the same thing I thought the night before and the day before that. I couldn’t have quit even if I’d wanted to. It was my only income, and I had rent to pay.



I’d always thought that the best parts of the job were the drives in and out. Not because I didn’t want to be there, which I didn’t, but because on the way in I’d usually catch a glimpse of the sunset. The yellow and red sign was an eyesore against the moody rainbow that made up most evenings, but it was fitting.



The way back home was always nice too, but more so because there were no people on the road, and that meant I could drive faster than 55. We were a little out of the way from any real towns, so it wasn’t like anyone would notice or care anyway. I hadn’t gotten pulled over up until then at least.



Once I had made it to my destination I finally parked, gathered my things, and went in, smacked by the smell of cooking oil and salt. The place was where I’d always imagined diets and clean eating came to die, not where I’d be spending my 20s. Regardless of how I felt though, people wanted their burgers, and I was only there to flip them.



“Adrian?” A voice piped up from behind the register. My partner for the night. “Hey! No rush, but get your apron on and come out, there’s gonna be some changes to the shift tonight.”



I flattened my hand in a salute as I walked past her.



My coworker, Catherine, was the same age as me. Somehow, she’d climbed the ranks in a short time and had recently been promoted to overnight shift lead. The woman must’ve worked more hours than anyone in this place, and she pulled a lot of extra weight, but she was basically guaranteed to never get a managerial role. Despite that though, she’d always managed to make people look forward to coming in, myself included. 



She was 5’5” max and had a mess of dirty blonde hair that was always tied up and back into a bun, probably for food safety reasons. She was well-liked. Whoever worked while she was around normally had nothing but nice things to say. However, when there were bad days, they were bad. When she got angry with us, she always had a cold stare. One that read ‘do better’ without her so much as opening her mouth. She wasn’t afraid to put her foot down and let whoever was around know she’d been disappointed. Luckily, I haven’t been one of the people she’d done that to, and I planned on keeping it that way for as long as I could. 



At the time I was super into her, though I hadn’t mustered up the courage to ask her out yet. I’d been working on it. She had a kind of air about her that made her unapproachable- to me. We’d hung out together a few times before, with other people we worked with. At that point, I’d thought my attempts at flirting had been getting through to her, but I never really had mustered up the chest hair to get it done.



The salute was all I could manage. 



I made my way to the break room, taking in a breath of old fry oil and mildew. There were a few lockers and chairs next to a table that adorned the back corner of the space. It wasn’t very large, but neither was the team who used it. We’d been about 10 people max, not counting those who were being paid a salary. Administration, representatives, and the like.



It took all of 5 minutes to shove my belongings into an empty locker and throw on my apron. “Cathy?” I called as I walked out. There was no one in the restaurant at this point, so it wasn’t like anyone would mind hearing whatever she needed to tell me. “What’d you need?”



“Don’t forget to punch in.” Her voice fell flat. I had.



“Shit, let me do that quick.”



“Please do,” she called after me “you’ll be my favorite!”



From the punch box I couldn’t help but let out a laugh. It hadn’t sounded like she was joking. Part of me suddenly felt a little proud for coming into such good fortune.



I made my way back over with a smile. She really knew how to make a guy giddy. “So, what’s up?”



With her attention on the register, she answered. “Gary, the new hire. You remember him?” 



I wracked my brain. Gary? “Yeah… yeah I remember him.”



I did not.



Catherine finally looked up at me. It’d been a look that reminded me of one my parents would use when they knew I was lying. They gave it to me hoping I’d fess up, but I was never very good at coming clean, as it appeared Cathy was newly learning. She sighed. “Well, he called in this afternoon to let us know that he would be quitting.”



“Damn, really? How long has he even been here?” At the time I didn’t blame the guy, but that was pretty low. He should’ve at least handed in a 2-week notice or something.



“This would’ve been his second shift I think.”



I took note: Gary was an asshole. “So why did I need to know that?”



I seemed to catch her off guard with that question as she didn’t answer me right away. Her gaze became soft, she pressed a finger to her lips, and it was over for me. I’d probably been supposed to help her think of the point, but I’d already wandered far beyond the arches. My thoughts raced; she was looking right at me. I caught her eyes, those pools of brown and green seemed to dance together in a way that made my chest light. Man, thinking on it now, I was a poet thinking of all the things I could say to her in that moment.



“Right...” she stammered, throwing a hand to her head that immediately reversed the spell her eyes had cast. The same hand was then thrown up above her head, and she sported a newfound look of remembrance. “Right! It’s just going to be us until 1. So, because Gary was a dick and didn’t show, we’re going to have to pull some extra weight.”



I groaned, which seemed to make Cathy smile. “Oh no! Stuck here alone with you? How will I ever survive?”



“Shut up and get to the grill please, I think I just heard the headset beep.” She shoved me playfully. There hadn’t been any beep if my memory serves me, but it did seem like my humor had rubbed off on her.  As she turned her attention back to our register and counting the till I went into the kitchen.



With only two people in the store, it isn’t hard to imagine that the night would be a drag. However, for whatever reason this night dragged on so unbelievably long that Catherine and I were almost forced to talk to each other out of sheer boredom. The once soothing sound of dirty, dripping oil was now as oppressive as bombshells. I thought we were surely in for the longest 8-hour shift ever recorded. There weren’t many customers either, which was always a given with the night shift. I had made 5 or 6 meals max by the time 3 hours had dripped away. I just wanted to flip something.



To kill time, I tried to strike up another conversation as I scraped the grill. I figured that if I got her talking about something interesting or important it would start a conversation that would last us to at least midnight.



“So,” I started “got any plans this weekend? Isn't it Memorial Day Weekend or something?”



“I was invited to Dylan’s again, but I’m not sure I’ll show. Were you going?”



“Seriously? No, I wasn't even invited.""



I heard a laugh. ""Well yeah, when you get so drunk you pass out in someone's flower bed it makes sense that you weren't invited again.""



""Everyone makes mistakes. Whatever, screw that. You aren't going anyway so who else would I bother?""



""I guess no one.""



There was silence as I recalled and scrubbed the memory of waking up to a bunch of angry party-goers and an even angrier mom. ""So, Hanging out with family then?”



“What? No.”



“What are you doing then?”



Her gaze didn’t leave the register as she counted the till for what felt like the thousandth time. However, after my comment, she stopped. When she spoke again, her voice dripped with strict caution. “Why?”



This caught me by surprise. “Well, I just…” It was my moment. I hadn’t expected this to be when or how I asked her, but it was the chance I was being given. “I was wondering if you’d have time to go out for some coffee or something.”



When she didn’t immediately reply I panicked. “But I understand if you’ll be busy. I know you work like every day and… yeah.”



I gave up and was embarrassed by the sound of laughter. I felt my cheeks warm up. As if she could read my mind, she answered. “I’m sorry,” she turned to me, and I saw a smile had grown from her lips. “I don’t mean to sound like I’m laughing at you- I’m not.”



I breathed a sigh, feeling as if I could melt at her feet. Her eyes searched me as I tried to find the right next words. “So... coffee?”



“Just us?""



I nodded, saying anything else here could be detrimental to the outcome.



""This weekend?""



Another nod. 



She seemed to think on it, still scanning my person, and pursed her lips. “Maybe, if I can and make it work with my shifts.”



It wasn’t a no, and I felt at that moment like I could flip 700 patties at once. Euphoria didn’t begin to cover the feeling that washed over me. I welcomed it, happy with this outcome.



“Oh actually,” her attention had turned to another area of the store “there’s something we have to do before I forget. You remember where the supply closet is right?”



“Yeah, but I’m not usually the one who goes in there.”



“Unfortunately, we both will be now that we’re the only people and Gary quit before doing the job for me. We gotta more cleaner for the floor. I don’t think anyone’s mopped today and it’s disgusting back here.”



I didn’t say anything, but I didn’t think anyone had mopped in at least a few weeks. Catherine did a lot of things; that was not typically one of those things. It was surprising she just noticed then, and I began to wonder how upset she’d be when the mop inevitably revealed the weeks of built-up dirt and grease. Thank God it wasn’t supposed to be my job either. I was safe from whatever lecture I figured would surely follow. I wish, more than anything, that dirt was the most alarming thing about that night.



“Alright,” she clasped her hands together almost excitedly, which I found funny “let’s get it moving then, I’ll turn the closed sign on for a little while. No one’s coming anyway.”



She’d been right, the people in our area at the time weren’t prone to coming in the late-night hours, but our regional manager had decided we’d be a 24-hour store regardless. Any sales were good sales I guessed, even if there weren’t too many. It was 10 pm, we’d probably get things situated before someone accidentally came through the drive-thru and realized the sign was on.



The supply closet was next to the break room down the same hall I’d taken when I got in. Letting Catherine get ahead of me, I followed her down to the small door. She fished out a ring of keys and sighed.



“Something wrong?” I asked, though something in my gut told me I already knew.



“Nah, just fine,” there was jingling as she continued “I wanted these keys labeled, but it looks like no one fucking did it.”



“Oh.”



“Yeah, well when no one can figure out what key unlocks the employee bathroom I’m sure that’ll change.”



I turned my head gingerly. Those were the kinds of things that went on at our location. We barely were in the green with sales, and no one was prone to taking time to do extra work. Everyone was keen on doing what was outlined when they were being trained and nothing more. We were constantly hard-pressed to find anyone who would do things they weren’t getting bonus money to do. No one, other than probably Catherine, was going to take the time and label the keys knowing it wasn’t going to get them any extra cash.



Before I knew it the door lock had clicked open, and Catherine let out a less irritated huff. “There we go. I’ll have to get this key remade but at least the door is open for now.”



“What’s wrong with the key?”



Spinning around, Catherine greeted me with the key she'd used to get the door unlocked. It was green and brown, with a rougher texture than the rest of the ones on the hoop. It had seemed as though someone left it around and waited for it to look like an antique before using it in the store. Why hadn’t they cleaned it ever or made a newer, nicer copy? Probably because the people there were lazy. I shook my head of the thought and grabbed past Catherine, landing on the door handle. I remember how cold it’d been. It caused me to pause, uneasy, but I shook my head clear of the feeling easily. I should have listened to my gut.



Upon opening the door, I was met with something I’d never seen in the storage closet before.



There was a staircase leading down.



“That’s a lot of remodeling. I’m surprised I didn’t notice this before.” I joked, nudging Catherine, but when she didn’t say a word, I glanced over to find her stunned to silence. She was stiff. “What’s wrong?”



“I just… this… the closet isn’t supposed to be like this.”



After a moment, I began laughing. I figured she knew I didn’t go in here often and was now trying to pull one over on me. I was honestly a little hurt by this. Surely I seemed smarter than that.



“That was really funny, but seriously, when did the guys add this in?”



She didn’t laugh with me as she stared down the stairs, so I nudged her in a way that hopefully read as ‘Cool joke! You don’t have to keep up the bit!’. “Guess I’ll just have to ask them when they- “



“They didn’t!” Her voice cracked, my breath caught and I continued my fit.



“I was just in here a few days ago, this can’t be new."" I heard her say eventually. ""They would’ve told me.”



Now I was getting confused. I cocked my head, laughter dying. I gathered eventually that we must’ve both been out of the loop with whatever renovations were being done here, so I tried to offer her solace.



“Once we grab the cleaner or whatever we can lock the door and ask admin tomorrow. Sound good?” She didn't reply, just nodded, keeping her eyes on the door. I wasn't sure what else to do to break her from the trance, so I turned my head too, gazing down into the dim light. There was nothing to fix my sight on, and the longer the silence went on, the longer I found myself making up crazy ideas for what could be down there.  Sure, it was probably just a dingy basement, but I thought it would be way cooler as some secret lab or drug cellar.



“Want me to go down first?” I found myself asking after a brief time. I wasn't ever one to care about getting back to my work, but we weren't going to be able to just stand around all night staring into nothing.



Catherine spun to face me, grabbing my hand. Her grip was firm enough to not come loose as I pulled back. “You want to go down? I have no idea if it’s even safe or finished. I can’t believe they didn’t tell me they were adding this in! What if there’s asbestos? I heard you can fuck up your lungs if you breathe in that stuff. Did we even need this?”



“Cathy.” I took a deep breath, stopping her rambling. “Everything is gonna be fine. We just gotta deal with this for now. If it makes you feel better, I’ll walk down and let you know if it’s finished yet- okay? No need for you to go down there if there’s raw shit floating around.”



As if my words had brought her anxiety down, she nodded and barely mustered up a smile. Letting go of my hand, we stepped back from one another.



“I’m sorry,” she put a hand up, gesturing to me as the other went to cover her eyes “I don’t know why I freaked out so bad. I think the doubles are catching up to me. It'd be nuts for the guys to put this in and just not tell anyone. I probably missed a memo or something.” I nodded. Taking a step toward the stairs, I took note of the poor job the owners had done.



They went down at least 15 feet, which felt wholly unnecessary for a fast food joint in the middle of nowhere, but I wasn’t paying for it so why did I care? At the landing the hall made a sharp left, obscuring my vision of the rest of the basement, which wasn’t great to begin with as the only light sources seemed to be oil lamps starting at around 5 feet in. I turned to Cathy for a moment, but once I saw her face I turned back and started walking down. She'd been staring down again, past me.",2,1743688764.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

I have been struggling with severe reflux, stomach pain, nausea since January. Testing I have had done so far. CT scan, Ultra Sound, Barium Flora. Results show gallstones and a slightly enlarged liver with 2 hemanhionas. Liver enzymes are normal. My PHP has me following up with a surgeon next week to discuss removal. I also have an appointment with GI specialist toward the end of the month. Other symptoms I have noticed but am only now thinking it
May be related are severe headaches, blurred vision at times and fatigue. I am literally down to a diet of oatmeal and toast...can't have much else. Not doing coffee, not doing alcohol. 

I want to make sure I am going through the process ""correctly"" it seems strange to me that I am seeing a surgeon to discuss removal before seeing GI. Should an upper scope be done first? Also, I keep seeing things about a HIDA scan. I have not had this done. Should I be asking about this?

I am apprehensive about having it removed and heard a lot of negative things, but I seriously can't live like this. Depression is sinking in. 

Would welcome any feedback.

by Preston Dennett

Face-to-face contact with a humanoid ET – it’s one of the most astonishing experiences a person can have. And it’s occurring to a huge number of people. It’s been happening across the planet for a very long time. While our governments are now admitting that UFOs are real, they still refuse to talk about humanoids. The question is why? Is it because these kinds of encounters represent the forefront of UFO research and have much to teach us about this subject? This video presents ten incredible cases of face-to-face contact with humanoids. These include multi-witness cases with supporting evidence. The time for truth is now!

A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE. One summer morning in 1948, Ernst-August R. was minding his sheep in a rural area of Hemer, Germany. Suddenly his sheep scattered as a large saucer-shaped craft landed next to him. Ernst reached out and touched it. He was immediately shocked and passed out. Upon awakening, he was surrounded by strange humanoids. They spoke briefly then returned to their craft, which took off, leaving strange landing traces in the field.

A VERY LOUD UFO. One afternoon in July of 1960, railway worker Georges Godbout and his two co-employees were maintaining the tracks of the Canadian National Railroad near Chapais, Quebec, Canada. Suddenly a strange craft appeared over the tracks. It stopped and a humanoid wearing a green bodysuit came out. He started to look around, but seeing the witnesses, promptly returned into the craft. The UFO flew off with such a loud noise that it made the witnesses physically sick.

SPRAYED BY A UFO. On the afternoon of September 30, 1971, Anssi Hakala (age 11) was bicycling to his home in rural Marttila, Finland after visiting a friend. Suddenly a tall, thin, green-skinned humanoid appeared, levitating above his head. Anssi panicked and biked away. The being disappeared into a craft, which then began to pace Anssi on his bike, spraying him with a strange unidentified liquid.

THE LAUGHING ALIENS. At 5:30 pm on September 27, 1973, Antoine X (a mechanic) was out picking edible mushrooms not far from his home in Bedarrides, France. Movement caught his eyes and he observed what he thought were two small children. But they wore fully-body, beige jumpsuits, had very fine features and looked identical. When Antoine called out to them, they laughed and fled into the brush. Moments later, a metallic craft rose up and darted away.

UFO AT A YOUTH CAMP. At 9:30 pm on February 3, 1977, a group of kids from a youth camp at Seven-Mile-Beach in Tasmania, Australia spotted a classic flying saucer hovering at low elevation. It was covered with lights and had several portholes, and through one of the portholes, the children saw a strange humanoid with an oversized head looking down at them.

UFO LANDS AT SCHOOL FOR THE DEAF. At 6:30 pm, Frank Sverre Mandte and Johnny Myrr (both age 11 and deaf) were approaching the Alm’s School near Honefoss, Norway, when they noticed a glowing object at low elevation by the nearby treeline. As they watched, it glided overhead, stopped, and then landed a short distance away. Both boys saw the figure of a humanoid looking down at them. The object took off, leaving behind undeniable landing traces.

ALIENS INSPECT FARMHOUSE. Just before 10pm on August 31, 1978, just as a power-outage struck the area of their home in La Dulce, Argentina, Manuel and Leonor Arias observed an oval craft with portholes hovering near their farm. It then ejected two very short figures with glowing red eyes who glided above the ground, came onto their property, and began to inspect their farm. They stayed for an hour. It was one of more than 20 encounters in the area around that time.

CHASED BY EXTRATERRESTRIALS. At 7:40 pm on September 21, 1978, an anonymous boy was walking through a construction site by his home in Cosenza, Italy when everything around him lit up like daylight. Looking around, he saw a strange craft landed on a nearby hill. A weird humanoid stood on top of it. Suddenly he saw four humanoids bounding towards him. He fainted and when he awoke, he was surrounded by the humanoids, each dressed in jumpsuits and helmets. He tried to fight them, fainted again, and when he awoke, they were gone.

AN ALIEN IN THE YARD. At 10:00 pm on the evening of November 24, 1988, Rune Asplund was drinking coffee in the kitchen his home in Daviken, Sweden when he observed a strange-looking figure just a few feet from his house, in his yard. The figure stood in a strange posture with its arms outstretched and its legs spread widely. It wore an unusual, shiny, metallic jumpsuit. Going outside to get a closer look, he saw the figure disappear into thin air. Rune later learned that a police officer saw a UFO the same night, which caused his cruiser to mysteriously stall. Rune also learned that a year earlier, his neighbor saw a strange, short humanoid, which disappeared the same way.

PLEASE TELL ME I’M NOT CRAZY. It was 1:30 am one night in the summer of 1999 when a fourteen-year-old girl heard a deafening screeching noise right outside the window of her second-story bedroom of her home in Clarksburg, Massachusetts. Looking outside, she saw a strange three-foot-tall being with gray skin, a hairless head and black eyes. Her sister and mother also heard the scream, rushed into the bedroom, and saw it too. The creature remained for fifteen minutes before finally leaving. But it would soon return.

These ten incredible humanoid encounters show how very strange face-to-face contact can be. And these ten accounts represent just a small portion of the true number of encounters. So many cases. So many types of humanoids. So much evidence! The time for skepticism is now over. We are being visited by aliens.

1jqizdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mirena/comments/1jqizdk/postremoval_experience_positive/,Post-Removal Experience (Positive!),"I've had my Mirena out for 2 weeks so far. No crash yet, and I'm in high hopes that I won't get one, but we shall see. I had it in for 2.5 years, but I was having some bad side effects that gradually got worse. In January, it got to the point where I was not feeling very healthy. I couldn't lose weight, I couldn't stomach water (I had 2 coffees and 1 coke zero per day), I only wanted candy (I had 2 snacks and 1 meal per day), I didn't want sex at all, hugging was very blah, and I felt tired and down all the time. Like, VERY down. I noticed a pattern that whenever I got a period (rarely), I would feel okay for a couple of days. So I figured I'm better off getting regular periods.

My doctor sent out a referral for removal. It took well over a month and I still heard nothing back. At this point, I was just losing it because I wanted it out. I was in distress over my side effects, and just wanted myself back. So I removed it myself, and luckily it went very well. I do not recommend that since a lot can go wrong, I was just really not mentally okay with how long it was taking, and I couldn't get through to other places. :( I was shaking and crying afterwards because I was so happy it was out.

The day after removal, physical touch started feeling euphoric, my libido came back (but I decided to wait a few days), the brain fog was gone, and I was peeing A LOT (bye water weight!).

3 days after removal, I lost 3lbs of water weight and the bloating was all gone. My appetite came back and I didn't have aversions to any food/drink. I had a few pimples show up and a 3-day light period (I had very intense/unexplained anxiety in the middle of the night, then in the morning my period started).   
  
I'm still holding up nicely today! I'm extremely energized and took up running again. I've had sex everyday for 2 weeks and my partners can barely keep up lol. I lost 5lbs total so far, and I have 20lbs more to lose to get to my pre-IUD weight. This is what my energy/activity levels were like before my IUD, so I'm hoping they stay this way.",2,1743688269.0,Mirena,0,1.0,False

I recorded audio to listen to later and now I’m listening to it and I didn’t hear it at first but now that I’ve turned up the volume I’m faintly hearing it. The music stopped when I left the coffee shop, but then I smelled gas on the way home- I feel like all of the things I’m hearing and smelling MIGHT be real but might also not be.

Anyways do you think the music was a hallucination?

[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jgruzz/the_ships_cat_chapter_1/) | [Previous ](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1joxbvs/the_ships_cat_chapter_4/)| Next

*The Eventide* was decelerating toward its destination, its crew preparing for the imminent flurry of activity. With just a quick unload of medical equipment and industrial components, they'd be turning around and heading back to the system's main trading station as soon as the job was done. Melanie had told everyone they'd be moving on to a new system just as soon as there was a contract worth taking; something not too risky and not too far - a few jumps at most.

Katie was wandering slowly around *The Eventide*, hoping to find Gordon. There weren't a lot of places to check given the size of the ship, but moving around the spaces took time and he had a frustrating habit of being in the loudest compartments, forcing her to rely solely on her eyes to find him. 

She'd only learned a little about him over the last few weeks, and he seemed to be cagey about some things. She'd tried helping him out with a couple of maintenance tasks but found it hard to hold a conversation around the louder machinery, and being the engineer on board meant he was up and down at all hours, usually sleeping or in his cabin in between. 

She got the impression that secretly, he might feel a little isolated, even if he didn't show it. He didn't talk much about people, preferring to talk about work instead, or telling stories about engineering and maintenance mishaps. He liked to assign personalities to inanimate objects as well, which Katie thought was fun and silly - a trait she hadn't expected to be so common in humans. It'd been hard to strike a balance between getting to know him a little deeper and not pressing him too much. 

Fortunately, she encountered him on his way back to his cabin, looking like he'd just wrapped up some last-minute job before arrival. He didn't seem to be in a hurry and she wouldn't have to shout - this was perfect. He hadn't noticed her yet, his mouth moving silently as he read his pad.

""Gordon!"" she beamed a delighted smile at him.

He almost jumped, and there was a brief moment before he held his chest, shaking his head. ""Always sneaking up on me, aren't you,"" he said, playfully tapping her on the head with his pad.

Katie smiled inwardly, congratulating herself on her keen instincts. He wasn't shy about flirting, when he wasn't completely distracted by his work.

""I think you're just going deaf from listening to machines 'complaining' all day."" She teased. She was careful not to stand too close to him, maybe just a little closer than usual, looking up at him with her amber eyes.

He shook his head and chuckled. ""Nope, I'm not biting. What can I do for you?"" he smiled.

She gave him her best pout before returning to a gentle smile, leaning against his cabin doorway. ""Do you have any plans this evening, once we're 'turned around'?"" She looked at him with anticipation. 

He raised an eyebrow, sliding the pad into his pocket before joining her in a casual lean, giving her his full attention. ""Honestly...no. Should be a quick stop so once everything's checked over after departure, probably an early night after a long day."" He smiled.

She may have bounced with happiness, just a tiny bit. The amusement twinkled in his eyes. 

""Great! How would you feel, about me...spending some time with you this evening?"" She raised one of her own eyebrows this time. She didn't need to wait for an answer. His face had gone slightly redder, and his breaths were a little deeper as he glanced not-so-subtly at her body. She waited anyway. 

Gordon seemed to hesitate for a moment, looking thoughtfully away. Katie wasn't sure of the reason, but took a guess.

""*To clarify*, I would like to spend some time bonding with you. If that becomes *physical*, then you should know that a romantic relationship is not a possible outcome. I hope that's not disappointing?""

He watched her face before looking away again. His face didn't drop, as she might have expected. He was considering her offer seriously, taking the time to think about what she was saying. It could be hard to tell when Gordon was lying, but his honesty was clear this time. 

""Yeah. I understand."" He nodded, finally. ""No - genuinely - that sounds good, and I could use the company."" He smiled an unexpectedly heartfelt smile. 

She was a little surprised. She'd expected an outright rejection or immediate agreement, not a thoughtful consideration. Warmed by his reaction, Katie smiled back and nodded. ""Good. I'll see you later, then."" She felt a little lighter as she touched his arm and turned to leave, heading back towards her own cabin.

Her bonding instincts had been gnawing away at her recently, and the human customs surrounding intimacy had been trickier to navigate than she'd initially thought. It was a huge relief to know she'd be able to address that issue soon, and a bonus that she might've broken down a wall with Gordon as well. 

She cheerfully greeted Melanie, who was walking past on her way to the bridge.

\*\*\*

Scott was in the pilot's seat for the approach, thumbs twiddling in a way that meant he was trying not to impatiently tap his feet.

Melanie handed him his coffee as she walked into the cockpit. ""Still no clearance?"" She offered the mug, eyebrows raised.

He shook his head. ""Nope."" he replied, taking a grateful sip. They both knew it didn't take this long, but neither needed to say it out loud. 

She frowned, bringing up the comms console and flicking through the screens, looking for any relevant notifications. Stations like this rarely had enough traffic for a queue. Most of it was to the planet surface - small, automated shuttles launched into orbit to deliver refined materials, coasting back down with supplies. 

""New security measures,"" he stated flatly. He paused to listen to his earpiece as station traffic finally approved the approach. He gave Melanie a quick thumbs up and deftly operated the controls, his practiced hands coaxing the ship gracefully towards the compact little station.

Melanie found nothing useful in the comms notifications. She rested a hand on his shoulder. ""Data sync when we arrive, please. Let's find out what we missed."" She left him to work, her own checklist already forming in her mind. 

He nodded without looking away, the small dock growing steadily larger as the ship drifted in. He made sure everything was by the book, staying well within the docking path, slow and steady. Something told him he shouldn't be ruffling any feathers today. Less than five minutes later, *The Eventide* was snugly occupying one of the two small docks designated for public use. Once he'd wrapped up his checks, he quickly requested a data update from the station's computer and hurried to join Melanie in the mess.

When he arrived everyone was already there, watching the latest news report on the small screen on the wall.



*""...station authorities are still assessing the full extent of the damage following yesterday's devastating bombing of a trading station around Orellia-2. Casualty figures remain unconfirmed, but reports so far estimate well over a hundred fatalities, with many more injured or unaccounted for.""*

*""While no group has claimed responsibility, an internal security briefing - leaked earlier today - mentions messaging found on a private terminal near the blast site. The language reportedly echoes ideological slogans common to several self-determinist factions, though officials have cautioned against drawing conclusions before investigations are complete.""*

*""Political analyst Meret Janso noted that ‘the rhetoric itself is not new - but the tone has shifted. What was once fringe political discourse has begun to normalise in some systems, especially where economic stress is high or interspecies governance has struggled to keep pace with expansion.’”*

*""The Provenance Movement issued a brief statement this morning condemning the attack, while reaffirming their platform of self-determination, cultural preservation, and economic independence. They strongly denied any affiliation with extremist groups.""*

*""Jump point authorities have implemented increased security protocols across several sectors, and multiple guilds have issued caution advisories to independent operators. Delays are expected for vessels flagged as multi-species or operating under cooperative charters.""*

*""This marks the third major security incident in as many months, though analysts disagree on whether the events are coordinated or merely symptomatic of deeper unrest.""*

*""More on this story as it develops. For now, officials ask all travellers to remain patient during elevated screening and to report any suspicious activity to the nearest security representative.""*



The crew's reactions were varied. Katie covered her mouth in horror, the sadness evident on her face. Melanie had a grim expression, her arm around Katie's shoulder. Luke was shaking his head silently. Gordon was sitting on the edge of a table, mouth halfway open, his face having lost most of its colour. 

""I had no idea...that, uh, even other races do that kind of thing, huh."" Gordon shook his head, looking at the floor sullenly.

Melanie nodded. ""...not just a human thing."" She agreed, grimacing in thought. ""We'll have to be careful today.""

""Buddy system. Nobody goes anywhere alone. We won't be here long, and hopefully it'll blow over by the time we move on to the next system."" Luke agreed. ""I'll help Mel and Kat unload. You two handle the rest, alright?

Scott sighed and nodded, walking over to Gordon. ""Aye. It's a sad thing. But the galaxy's like that sometimes."" He patted Gordon heavily on the back, as the poor guy got shakily to his feet. ""C'mon fella, let's check off the walkaround and get her ready ta go."" 

\*\*\*

Luke and Melanie stood on the rear ramp of *The Eventide*, watching the two Baskans approach. 

It had been a brief, but wholly unpleasant stop. It happened sometimes, in particularly quiet corners. Occasional mutterings about 'unwelcome outsiders' and deeply suspicious looks from the workers had most of the crew a little unsettled. Gordon's interaction with the turnaround crew had been particularly abrasive, ending in one of them referring to Gordon as some kind of alien sewer-dwelling crab. Scott had to run it through the translator three times to figure out whether he should be offended or not. His hysterical laughter when he deciphered it seemed to earn some points among the turnaround crew.

Still, it was hard to shake the feeling that they were unwelcome. Luke eyed the larger Baskan warily, keenly aware of the sidearm strapped to the lumbering creature's waist. The large bag on its back made it less threatening, but not by much.

""That must be...her?"" Melanie guessed, squinting.

He double-checked the contract on his pad. Definitely just one. Melanie cleared her throat as they reached the bottom of the ramp.

""Hello! Can we help you at all?"" Melanie had an uncharacteristically friendly tone to her voice, contrasting the obvious sidearm on her hip. The change from her usual demeanour made Luke smile inwardly. She was playing it smart - don't reveal anything, let them speak first. 

The smaller of the pair wasn't fazed; It smiled, in fact. Luke assumed it was used to this kind of exchange. 

""Greetings! My name is Tzlvexeirn Trh'tegghott. My father has contracted your services for transport to the trading station in this system.""

Melanie blinked at the name. ""Tizzle...vex...airn...?"" She looked to Luke for help.

Luke nodded. ""Do you have any identification, please?"" He continued eying the larger Baskan warily, who was looking at him with equal suspicion. 

She held out her credentials, and he scanned them with his pad. A soft beep confirmed the match.

Luke nodded, smiling. ""Thank you. You're in the right place; but the contract is for one passenger?""

Tzlvexeirn gestured to the larger Baskan, who handed the bag to her. ""This is my nephew Grzhakkenth, he is just... escorting me here.""

Grzhakkenth emitted a low growl as he first looked over the ship, and then Luke and Melanie. ""I do not like entrusting your safe passage to these...aliens."" He stated bluntly, ignoring them.

""I trust the trading guild, and the trading guild trust them."" She replied with equal bluntness. ""You may call me Tiz if you prefer,"" She smiled another toothy grin at Luke and Melanie, ""I am aware humans struggle with our names."" She giggled, and then raised a hand to cover her mouth, embarrassed.

She *giggled*? Baskans had one of two laughs - chuckle or hearty belly laugh. A small ""Hah"" or explosive ""HAH!"". Those were their standard options. Melanie stole a quick sideways glance, but Luke's expression gave nothing away. She reached out to take one of Tiz's bags, deliberately brushing the awkwardness aside.

""Welcome! I'll get you settled. I think you'll fit right in!""

She took Tiz and her bags up the ramp, leaving Luke to watch Grzhakkenth lumber back to the station with a series of heavy thuds.

""I'm sorry - I didn't catch your second name?"" Melanie said as she carried her big bag towards the spare cabin.

""I did not throw it!"" Tiz chuckled. ""It is Trh'tegghott. You may know it by the family trading name, Teggot.""

Melanie's brow furrowed, placing the bag carefully inside the door of the cabin. ""Teggot. Teggot-""

""-Teggot Minerals, yes"" Tiz helpedfully finished as she squeezed past to look around the cabin. ""This will be...fine. Thank you.""

Teggot Minerals. Not a galactic powerhouse, but it did operate a dozen or so mining and refining stations in the surrounding systems. Melanie had probably seen the name a hundred times over the past year on various contracts. It was strange to think of a corporation being owned and operated by a family; she tended to think of them as just boring, grey entities with suits and shareholders. 

""Huh. Heading on to your next job?"" She inquired, lingering at the doorway.

""No..."" Tiz frowned slightly, sighing as she patted the bunk, testing it before she sat down. ""My father believes I should be somewhere safer, given recent...events. I am his only child. He is...overprotective."" 

""Ah."" Melanie nodded in understanding. Best to leave it there, she thought, collecting herself. ""I'll be checking in before we depart, just to make sure everything's safely stowed, but please - make yourself at home. Just don't wander too far aft or into the cockpit. I'll give you a full briefing when I come back.""

""Understood. Thank you again."" Tiz replied, with another toothy smile.

Melanie smiled politely and turned away, leaving Tiz to prod curiously at the cabin's display screen. 

At any given time, there were always unfortunate events taking place somewhere in the galaxy. Wars, skirmishes, small rebellions, attacks like the one they'd seen on the newscast; it wasn't new. Most happened in some far-off place, distant and unconnected by name, culture or familiarity. It was a little different when it happened just a few jumps away. She idly wondered if people far away were looking at this event with the same, disconnected lack of concern that she'd shown in the past. 

This one felt a little too close though, and she was keen to find the contract that would get them far away from this area of space. She shook it off and headed back to work. The sooner they were gone, the better. ",3,1743687474.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1jqinsd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GenZ/comments/1jqinsd/it_really_is_because_of_that_damn_phone/,It really is because of that damn phone,"I don't care how much I sound like a Gen X mom in this post. It IS that damn phone.

Modern teenagers spend [more than 7 hours a day](https://explodingtopics.com/blog/screen-time-for-teens) on screens. If you do the math, you'll find that [the average 18 year old will spend 93% of the free time in their life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TMPXK9tw5U) in front of a screen. Of course, pretty much no one *wants* to spend 93% of their free time on a screen, but these things are designed to be addictive. Social media companies have teams of the smartest neuroscientists in the world dedicated to keeping you addicted to YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, Snapchat, Reddit, and whatever else you like to include. Since our lawmakers are too incompetent to protect their citizens from these things, it's up to you to snatch back control over your time.

The effects from spending hours a day on your phone are strong and well documented. Studies have consistently shown for years that high screen time is [strongly correlated with increased anxiety, depression, loneliness, and all sorts of other issues](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10353947/). It's appalling that social media platforms can be used by *children* (or anyone else, honestly) when the implications of these platforms are known to be horrible. Social media for minors is completely unjust - it's setting up a fight between the willpower of a 15 year old, and a supercomputer designed by the smartest people on earth to keep you addicted. Who is going to win that fight? On average, for seven hours a day, the supercomputer wins.

Social media is also known for sending people down political pipelines that dump people on the extremes of both sides, and polarization is now higher than its been in decades, which makes sense when you consider your feed is specifically tailored to you. Remember the killing of the health insurance company leader, and how pretty much everyone online seemed to support it? Turns out, only [17% of Americans view that event favorably](https://www.axios.com/2024/12/17/united-healthcare-ceo-killing-poll). Extrapolate this example to other political issues and you get an idea of why we're so divided and why we're so shocked when our candidates don't win or our ideas prevail in the real world.

There's a reason why [more successful people spend less time on a screen](https://www.commonsensemedia.org/sites/default/files/research/report/2022-infographic-8-18-census-web-final-release_0.pdf) \- high income earners are consistently the least affected by phones and social media. I've met only one person under 18 who has their own business, and I've also only met one person under 18 who chooses to use a burner phone instead of a smartphone. Guess what? They're the same person. Coincidence? I think NOT!

Also, I need to rant about how much people my age use their phones in public. It's genuinely sad. I take a couple classes for dual enrollment credit at a local technical college, and no one even talks to each other. Everyone's just on their phones all. The. Time. In my English class (which may have problems, but is still very fun and interesting considering it's English), half the class is openly on their phones for the entire lecture.

I've tried to talk to my classmates, but usually whenever I do, they give a one sentence response and then go back to scrolling on their phone. Like, really? This is the loneliest generation ever, so you'd think that people would welcome friendly interaction, especially since *I'm* doing the hardest move of starting the conversation, but nope. If I'm missing some key detail in these situations, feel free to tell me in the comments because I have no idea (and no, I am not ugly or dressed weird, you can rule that reason out).

""Well maybe they just don't want to talk"" Sure, people don't have to talk to me, that's fine. But then I should see this trend with older adults, and I haven't seen that. I've yet to be in a place where people over 35 behave this way.

Just please, for the love of God, put your phone away in public unless you're actively making plans or doing something important. Even if you don't talk to anyone, and even if you just sit there, it's still so much better than being in front of a screen. Try it, at least once. Start a conversation with the old man in front of you on the train. Read a book if you're bored in class. Study the bulletin for nearby events while standing in line for coffee. You'll rediscover the world beyond your screen.

""But what if I have social anxiety?"" Research suggests your phone is to blame for social anxiety in the first place. I'm not here to tell you exactly what will work for curing your social anxiety, but you know what *won't* work? Scrolling on your phone to avoid making eye contact with the person in front of you. Seriously, do *anything* else.

""But I don't have energy for anything besides using my phone when I get home from school/work!"" You don't even need to have energy to do better things than scrolling TikTok. Literally sitting still and staring at a wall would be better for you than TikTok, Reddit, YouTube Shorts, or whatever you scroll on. At least a wall won't feed you misinformation. With any luck, you'll get bored of staring at the wall and be forced to do something interesting like go outside.

""You have almost 100K Reddit karma, aren't you kind of a hypocrite?"" Yes, I am. We all are. I used to waste a pathetic amount of time on this platform, and even though I cut my time down considerably, I still have a big problem with screen time. I'm as much a victim of these tech companies as you are. I just hope to shed some light on what your phone and computer are doing to you.

If just one person quits Reddit, TikTok, YouTube, or just stops using their phone because of this post, I have done my job well. And if you want to be that one person, go, do it. Stop reading and start doing.

TLDR: Sorry, but that's not available here. If it would kill you to read the post, then you need to read it more than anyone else.

1jqin9q,https://i.redd.it/h3il3xumgmse1.jpeg,[Agave Review #28] Balsamal (Verdor) Claro,"With the same bottle and label, but a different-colored lettering and without barrel aging, Balsamal Claro is Balsamal's unaged offering and that is sold as Verdor in the states. I tried the original Puro about three years ago, one of their first products, in a different bottle and much more artisanal. I'm sure the current product follows artisanal processes, but it looks and is a bit more expensive.

This Balsamal Claro comes with new investors, which have given it a new bottle, labels and international distribution were truly needed to adapt to modern times. Balsamal Claro is a 100% cocui trelease agave product, distilled by master cocuyero Cristóbal Sánchez and bottled at 40% alcohol.

Made by: Cristóbal Sánchez  
Name of the Agave (Cocuy): Claro  
Brand: Balsamal  
Origin: Venezuela  
Age: None  
Price: $40

**Nose:** The nose is strong with aromas that include perfumed, floral notes, but also very herbaceous, with hints of sarrapia and white pepper. It doesn't present many other aromas, but rather these develop, producing distinct nuances closely related to them.

**Palate:** On the palate, it's quite straightforward, but also has some interesting additional notes. It has the typical herbaceous flavor of cocuy, but with notes of green pepper, which after a while begin to include flavors of cardamom and finally green coffee, just like before roasting. 

**Retrohale/Finish:** A bit of that cardamom and a sweet note.

**Rating:** 8.5 on the t8ke 

**Conclusion:** It's interesting because the flavors in Blasamal Claro aren't typical, but of course, they're flavors achieved thanks to the raw materials, the distillation, and the hand of the master cocuyero. I also loved having tried the reposado before the blanco, because you can feel the evolution of some of those flavors I'm experiencing here, and that green coffee note in the Claro feels like roasted coffee in the reposado. This Claro is undoubtedly one of the reasons why I'll always like the white cocuy more.

She had a ton of helpful advice, but officially diagnosed me with rosacea. She specifically recommended an ongoing laser treatment that I’m open to, however, with my job and education I am having to constantly present and speak in front of large groups. She said that the laser can cause temporary bruising, but looking at my schedule I’m publicly presenting or having important meetings until… August?

So, I’m fair/blonde/light eyed, but my face is straight up *red* if I’m not wearing foundation, which I don’t like to do. What are some topical things for the redness I can use with 0.05 tret every other night? I don’t use much else but lots of moisturizing (Aveeno positively radiant and LaRoche Posay… something I can’t remember) since I started tret 1.5 months ago.

A few other things if anyone has some experience: I have a mole that I hate and throws off my facial balance. Derm said she can easily shave that, but for some reason that gives me the willies (I can get over it), but keep in mind I’m in the public eye *a lot* and am wondering if anyone else has had this done. She said this wouldn’t be the kind where they stitch it, just a topical treatment where I’d need a bandaid. If you had something similar done, how long until it wasn’t super obvious? Any tips?

Forehead/11s Botox was definitely recommended, which I do want at some point. So basically, I have super red skin, prone to peri derm which I’ve adjusted teeth brushing and face washing but still seems to occur, considering cosmetic mole removal, lasers for rosacea, have dark circles more pronounced with my complexion, scant but some deeper cheek scarring from teen acne, and have heavy lines in my forehead I’m going to treat but otherwise some lines are cropping up elsewhere (I won’t Botox them yet). What would you recommend adding? I’m also open to diet recommendations. I stopped alcohol entirely about 2 months ago, which I’ve heard impacts rosacea.

Just bought my first house and curious about anyone's thoughts to make our small kitchen/dining combo function well. There's really limited square footage and a walkway on either side of the galley layout (smaller than I really realized when I initially toured it) - and sitting down to eat is important to us, and we love cooking often. We also make coffee daily using a grinder and pourover which has typically lived on the table space in our current apt with a more roomy kitchen. Even things like a blender feel hard to know where to place. We also have a dog and cat as well and typically have water/food bowls in here. We don't have a mudroom at the side door or anything either. We do have a very large partially finished basement (extra bedroom upstairs as well - just fyi so y'all get the overall picture lol).
As you can maybe see in the photos the food pantry is just to the left of the counter space (the side with the sink on it) - super narrow but fairly deep so we can make it work. Kinda crazy how little storage there is but i know I have a solid amount of cabinet space. We were thinking about having some shallow floating shelves in the little ""dining nook"" but really don't want that area to feel too cramped either. There are only two of us so we only really need two table chairs for daily use but i was hoping i could have people over to eat at some point in time which is feeling less possible in this space.
Any tips or suggestions on utilizing this space well would be greatly appreciated, or some support for small kitchen/dining living lol. I will say too that this kitchen is ugly imo and we want to make aesthetic updates without gutting the whole thing (think refacing cabinets and redoing backsplash/counter at max - but that's for the future).

So, I take my little pink pill and wait.

I have chronic migraines, and I really wanted to avoid taking a triptan today!

First thing I notice: it seems to *reduce* that lingering migraine a bit. At the very least, it’s not making it worse. Yay. Then, vaguely, it feels like I can *see* better. Weird.

I have my coffee (when I say “a coffee,” I mean I fill up my French press every morning just for myself). And now—I swear—I can SEE BETTER. Colors look clearer, the light seems brighter. It’s like my vision is *faster*. Not spinning or anything, just… faster. It’s such a hard feeling to explain!

There is this girl that works in the same building I do but it is a big one and our work isn't related. I passed in her team's office once and we talked a little bit in a group and then I saw her in the hallway and talked to her about something for a few minutes.

Since then she became my crush basically and after being in vaction for a week, on sunday I decided to go and update her about that topic  we talked about. Sadly I got cold feet and did not ask her out then. Reallizing my mistake I went to her office multiple times through the week to just ask her to grab coffee sometime but she wasn't there each time.

Decided to maybe get her number from acquaintance but he had a busy day and couldnt really talk so I decided to send an instagram follow. She has around 50 followers and 0 posts so I think there is also a chance she might be inactive. Around 16 hours have passed and she did not approved it yet.

Considering whether to just wait until next week or ask that acquaintance again (just over messages).

What do you guys think?

TLDR; I have a crush on a girl at work(just same building not same job), tried to ask her out but missed the chance. She’s been absent when I looked for her, so sent an Instagram request, but she hasn’t accepted after 16 hours.

1jqid6f,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jqid6f,Layout/organization ideas for super compact eat-in kitchen with no dining room?,"Hi all! Just bought my first house and curious about anyone’s thoughts to make our small kitchen/dining combo function well. There’s really limited square footage and a walkway on either side of the galley layout (smaller than I really realized when I initially toured it) – and sitting down to eat is important to us, and we love cooking often. We also make coffee daily using a grinder and pourover which has typically lived on the table space in our current apt with a more roomy kitchen. Even things like a blender feel hard to know where to place. We also have a dog and cat as well and typically have water/food bowls in here. We don’t have a mudroom at the side door or anything either. We do have a very large partially finished basement (extra bedroom upstairs as well – just fyi so y’all get the overall picture lol).

As you can maybe see in the photos the food pantry is just to the left of the counter space (the side with the sink on it) – super narrow but fairly deep so we can make it work. Kinda crazy how little storage there is but i know I have a solid amount of cabinet space. We were thinking about having some shallow floating shelves in the little “dining nook” but really don’t want that area to feel too cramped either. There are only two of us so we only really need two table chairs for daily use but i was hoping i could have people over to eat at some point in time which is feeling less possible in this space.

Any tips or suggestions on utilizing this space well would be greatly appreciated, or some support for small kitchen/dining living lol. I will say too that this kitchen is ugly imo and we want to make aesthetic updates without gutting the whole thing (think refacing cabinets and redoing backsplash/counter at max - but that’s for the future).

1jqictd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndianWomen/comments/1jqictd/confused_about_my_friendshipmixed_signals_or_just/,Confused About My Friendship—Mixed Signals or Just Overthinking?,"Hey everyone, sorry for the long read! I (25M) have a really close friend (26F), and we’ve known each other since 2015, but became really close around 2018. By close, I mean sharing everything—she asks for my opinion before posting anything on Instagram. We also had access to each other's accounts at one point.

She was in a long-term relationship until 2022, then dated another guy for two years, and recently had a brief three-month relationship. Before getting involved with the most recent guy, she even casually asked if I thought it was a good decision. Meanwhile, I’ve had a few talking stages, but nothing serious like what she’s had.

I was out of the country from 2021 until early 2025, but we stayed in touch constantly. Since I got back in January, we’ve been hanging out—coffee, food, random meetups. Lately, since her breakup, we’ve been seeing each other even more, with her initiating plans, including an upcoming fancy dinner (her idea). Just the other day, she joked about how we both have terrible luck in relationships and are probably going to die alone.

The idea of dating each other never seriously crossed our minds before. I was away for four years, and though I may leave again next year, the chances are slim. Meanwhile, she’s starting to settle into the mindset of an arranged marriage because, according to her, “that’s what everyone’s doing these days.”

Now, here’s where things got weird. Yesterday, she was taking an overnight bus for work and was feeling down. When I asked why, she said it was the first time in eight years that no one told her, “Message me when you reach.” I had messaged her before she left, but not that specific phrase because I planned to chat with her during the trip. I explained that, but she said it’s different when it comes from me versus her boyfriends. That honestly stung.

I told her I understood why she might feel disappointed not hearing it from a long-term boyfriend, but she’s known me much longer than her three-month ex, so why does my concern mean less? When I asked her if she would have been happier if I’d said it as her boyfriend, she just brushed it off with, “Leave it, I don’t want to date anymore anyway.”

Now, I’m confused. I’ve always felt there was at least some unspoken attraction between us, and lately, there have been subtle hints—especially since she asked for my thoughts before breaking up with her recent ex. But this whole situation makes me wonder if I’m in some weird version of the friendzone or if she actually has feelings for me.

I’m upset that, no matter how long we’ve known each other, my efforts and wishes will always be secondary to whatever boyfriend she has—even if it’s someone she just started dating. I don’t know if I’m overthinking this or if there’s something more to it. Should I just brush it off and keep things as they are, or take some distance to avoid getting caught up in this dynamic?

TL;DR: Been close friends with a woman (26F) for years, stayed in touch even while abroad. Since returning, we’ve hung out more, especially after her breakup. She seemed upset that I didn’t check in on her like her exes did, making me feel like my concern always comes second to whoever she’s dating. Not sure if I’m overthinking or if there’s more to it—should I just move on from this dynamic?

I'm looking to buy a used espresso machine and need some advice on which one to choose. I've narrowed it down to three options, all in good condition and within the same price range:

1. **ECM Mechanika IV** (no PID, not slim, vibratory pump), 3-4 years old - **Comes with Pascale I-MINI TIMER grinder.**
2. **Bezzera BZ10** (wooden knobs, no PID), 3-4 years old - **Comes with Bezzera BB005 MN grinder.**
3. **Lelit Mara X** (not sure about the model, possibly new)

I typically make 1-3 cups a day, with about half of them being milk-based drinks like lattes and cappuccinos. I like the narrower design of the BZ10 and Mara X, but I'm okay with the ECM as well.

I'm looking for a machine that can handle daily use and produce great espresso and milk-based drinks. Any insights or personal experiences with these machines would be greatly appreciated!

Before you pack your bags, let’s break down the **cost of living in Dubai**, the best **budget-friendly places to stay**, and how to **manage expenses while job hunting**.

# 1. Dubai Visit Visa Cost & Renewal Fees

To explore job opportunities, you’ll need a **Dubai visit visa**. The cost depends on the duration:

✔ **60-day visit visa** – Suitable for short job hunts.  
✔ **90-day visit visa** – Popular among job seekers.  
✔ **120-day visit visa** – Ideal for extended job searches.

If you don’t land a job within the visa period, you must **renew your visa or exit and re-enter**. Plan for renewal fees and potential travel costs.

# 2. Best Affordable Areas to Stay in Dubai

Accommodation is **the biggest expense in Dubai**. Renting a private apartment can be costly, so **shared accommodation and bed spaces** are better options for job seekers.

# Top Budget-Friendly Areas:

🏠 **International City** – Affordable studios & shared flats.  
🏠 **Al Nahda** – Well-connected, lower rents.  
🏠 **Deira** – Great for expats, cheap living costs.

**Cost of Shared Housing in Dubai:**

* **Bed space in shared apartments**: AED 800 – AED 1,500/month
* **Studio apartment**: AED 2,500 – AED 4,000/month
* **One-bedroom apartment**: AED 4,000 – AED 6,000/month

If you’re on a tight budget, opt for **sharing a room with other job seekers** to cut rental costs.

# 3. Daily Expenses: Food, Transport & Utility Costs

💰 **Grocery & Food Costs**  
Cooking at home is the best way to save money. On average:  
✔ Groceries (per month): **AED 700 – AED 1,200**  
✔ Dining out (budget-friendly restaurants): **AED 15 – AED 40 per meal**  
✔ Fast food meal: **AED 25 – AED 35**

🚆 **Transportation Costs in Dubai**  
Public transport is **efficient and affordable**. Options include:  
✔ **Dubai Metro & Bus Pass** – AED 300/month (best for daily commuters)  
✔ **Taxis & Ride-Sharing (Uber, Careem)** – Expensive for regular use  
✔ **Car Rentals** – AED 1,500+ per month (not recommended for job seekers)

💡 **Utility Bills & Internet Costs**  
✔ Electricity, water & cooling – AED **500 – 1,000/month**  
✔ Internet – AED **300 – 500/month**  
✔ Mobile data – AED **100 – 200/month**

# 4. Hidden Costs Job Seekers Often Forget

📄 **CV Printing & Job Applications** – AED 50-100 per month  
☕ **Networking & Coffee Meetups** – AED 300-500 per month  
💳 **Visa Renewal or Exit Costs** – AED 1,000-2,500 if required

# 5. Smart Money-Saving Tips for Dubai Job Seekers

✅ **Choose shared accommodation** – Reduces rent by 50-70%  
✅ **Use public transport** – Monthly metro pass saves money  
✅ **Cook at home** – Avoid expensive dining  
✅ **Avoid unnecessary spending** – Focus on essentials  
✅ **Apply for jobs online** – Reduces printing & travel costs

# 6. Is Dubai Worth Moving to for Job Seekers?

Dubai offers **high-paying jobs, tax-free salaries, and a booming job market**. However, the cost of living can be challenging without financial planning. If you **budget wisely and secure a job within your visa period**, Dubai can be the perfect place to build your career.

Just yesterday, I stepped outside for what I thought would be a quick breeze, but it turned into a full-blown sneeze-fest!

1. **Daily Antihistamines**: I started taking them every morning like my daily coffee ritual. It really helps!
2. **Air Purifiers**: Investing in one for my bedroom has been a game-changer. I wake up feeling less like a stuffed-up marshmallow.
3. **Sunglasses**: Not just a fashion statement, they keep pollen from flying straight into my eyes! Who knew I’d look so cool while staying allergy-free? 😎
4. **Ditching the Shoes**: I made it a habit of leaving my shoes at the door to prevent bringing in allergens.

**A funny thing happened last week**: I thought it would be genius to go for a stroll in the park—right into the heart of pollen city! It turns out, that’s not the best idea if you want to breathe normally. 😂

**Setup and Initial Use:** Setting‌ up the Baby Brezza Formula Pro Mini is relatively ‍straightforward. ​The included *baby brezza mini instructions* ⁢are generally clear,even though some users may find the initial calibration process slightly confusing. Ensure you consult the⁤ manufacturer's website for the‍ correct *baby brezza mini settings* applicable to your specific‌ formula⁢ brand. Getting this right is crucial‍ for accurate dispensing and⁢ optimal formula consistency.

**Performance:** Once calibrated, the machine dispenses formula quickly and efficiently. ​The mixing is generally good, with minimal⁢ clumping observed. The warming function works well, delivering bottles at the desired temperature ​consistently. ⁢The bottle size setting allows for dispensing ‍anywhere between 2-10⁣ ounces. For ‌slightly taller‍ bottles, a ⁤bottle stand can be purcahsed separately.

**Cleaning:** Maintaining‌ proper hygiene ‌is paramount when preparing infant formula. The *baby brezza mini cleaning* process requires regular disassembly⁢ and cleaning of various components, including the powder container, water​ tank, mixing funnel, and dispensing ‍nozzle. ⁣While not overly complex, consistent‍ cleaning is essential to⁢ prevent bacterial growth and ensure the machine⁣ operates effectively.

## Why Choose the‍ Mini Over the Original? Understanding the Differences

A common question among parents is *baby brezza mini vs⁤ original*: Which model is​ right for me? The ‍primary ‍difference lies in size and capacity.

The Advanced, on the ‌other hand, is better suited for larger families or those who prefer to prepare formula less‍ frequently. Both ​machines ⁣offer the same core functionality: automated formula mixing and⁣ dispensing.

Name: -

Villain name: - 
(I am not sure if I should insert names here at all)


Age: 21


Birthday: 6/5 


Quirk: ""Norse Support""


Description: If the user of this quirk writes down or carves a Nordic rune into something it becomes a source of power based on the meaning of the rune. 


Reidho: Speed boost 


Ansuz: Resilience 


Uruz: physical strength booster.


-And so on.


Downsides: Only three runes at the time can stay active, a dune gets inactive after getting destroyed or after new runes get made.
Runes need to be touched to work and after touching the effect of a rune only stays active for about a minute.
""OC"" himself can't use his own runes to strengthen himself so it's support only.
""OC"" needs to know the meaning of runes and therefore has to learn ""runes"" to be able to use them.


Backstory: ""OC"" was born in Germany and pretty much from a early age on got dragged around by his mother all over Germany, pulling him away from his father. As the years passed and bad boyfriend after bad boyfriend came and went ""OC"" developed a introverted, silent type personality.
One of his mother's boyfriends was a real criminal, everything seemed fine at first but things quickly spiralt down so ""OC"" had to get the cops involved. 
After a few problems he then had with his mother he decided to run away with his girlfriend in the age of 17 , the police didn't even bother to stop him.
He was bothered by nightmares and feelings of guilt and decided to run away to his dream country ""Japan"" to start a new life. He went there without learning the language or informing himself properly and quickly made a few mistakes to many with the wrong people. A fresh group from the underground called the S.A.S brothers took him in. Since the leaders are from England he can at least communicate with them in english even with his strong Dialekt, occasionally they teach him a bit Japanese.
In the underground he takes on the role of ""emergency security support"" meaning if the underground is in danger he will enhance the powers of the underground people without having to fight directly himself. He didn't like the thought of becoming a criminal but somehow this life, this freedom, the loyalty amongst each other, he likes it.


Weaknesses: 


Sensitive to outside factors and stress wich causes migraines.
Tends to push himself to hard.
Often does not speak up if he has problems. 
Trys to solve his problems alone because he doesn't want to be a burden to others.
The wrist of his dominant hand is stiffened do to an broken arm injury that never healed properly.


Strengths:
Calm minded.
Kind hearted. 
Often is the voice of reason.


Fears:
Fear of loss and failure.
Fear to never be enough.
Fear of changes.


Personality: big brother persona (sarcastic dick but will help if you have problems) 
Silent listener.
Calm, kind and sarcastic.


Favorite foods:


Meal: selfmade Napoli.


Drink: can't decide between cola, tonic water and coffee.


Snacks: sour gummy worms.


Hobbys: cooks himself and experiments with food, plays video games, writes down ideas.",0,1743685503.0,BNHA_OC_Characters,3,0.33,False

In comparison, 2024 was a lot quieter of a year. Christopher spent the early part of the year writing some additional scenes and drawing a new world map for the Deluxe edition of Murtagh, which eventually released in October, and with it he did another short round of touring and three long fan interviews. Between those two events he worked a lot on his screenwriting skills, interspersed a bit by attending the occasional convention or online event. And at the end of the year he launched a kickstarter and did a reddit AMA to help promote it.

The bigger of these sources have already had dedicated reddit compilation posts about, and so will not be repeated here. (See the links in the comment under this post.) But there's still some smaller sources that I haven't yet touched. This series of four reddit posts will therefore cover the period between May 1st and December 31st 2024, using seventeen different sources (interviews, panels, podcasts, fan letters, etc), as well as Christopher's social media from the time period. All quotes are followed by a numbered source, which can be referenced in a comment under this post.

This post will cover **Future Works and Adaptations**. The next post will cover In-Universe questions and Inspirations.

And that’s just the reality of it, but I would love to have something out next year.* [5]

> *As far as any future projects, well I got to actually write them and then I can talk about them. But hopefully that'll be fairly soon.* [4]

> **In Brisingr, the memory that Saphira shows Eragon mentions that Aren is still there on Brom's right hand. However, he had already given that ring in Teirm to the messenger to take to the Varden.**  
> *It’s been fixed in upcoming reprints. :D* [R]

> **""The elf Arya carried the egg ... And in this manner, five-and-twenty years passed.""**

**Illustrated Edition Eldest**

> *The illustrated edition of Eldest, the second book in The Inheritance Cycle, should come out next year. We don't have an exact date for that yet, but if you follow my social media we'll announce that. I've been reviewing illustrations for that at the moment. The Illustrated Edition of Eragon sold so well we're doing the next one, and hopefully we'll get to do the whole series.* [4]

> *We are working on the illustrated edition of the second book, Eldest, which should be out next year. I am already looking at the sketches and drawings for that edition. It is going to be as beautiful as the first one.* [13]

> **Really hoping it drops next year...**  
> *It, uh ... got pushed to '26. Sorry. There were so many illustrations (and revisions), that Random House couldn't make it work for release in '25. We should have some other cool stuff out for you, though.* [T]

**Murtagh 2**

> *With Murtagh, I have reached the point now where I have to start to actually deliver answers and payoffs, and I want to assure anyone watching answers and payoffs are now coming. All the groundwork is in place.* [4]

> *""Ithring"" would be a good name for a book. Hmm. Imagine a series where each book is named after one of the swords of the Inheritance Cycle. That could be cool.* [T]

> *There's still a couple of things I wish I had done with Thorn in the book that didn't quite work out but that maybe is for a future story.* [6]

> **How dare you with the second half of the book?**  
> *Guess you need a sequel, then!* [T]

> **We need a Stronghammer book after Murtagh.**  
> *Both. Both. Both. Both is good.* [T]

> *I have many more books in this world that I want to write and Murtagh is the first of that sequence, so to speak. But a lot of that just depends on time and energy.* [12]

> **Are you going to give us more stories within Alagaësia?**  
> *Certainly, and Murtagh is the first of many steps on this path. You will notice that there are some questions left unanswered in this book, and those lead directly to the next one I want to write. So we will see a lot more of Murtagh, Eragon, and all the other characters.* [13]

> *Murtagh was something that I originally envisioned as a complete standalone novel. A one off from Murtagh's point of view to address his point of view and his story that still needed resolving from the Inheritance Cycle. Having written that book now and had lots of time to think about the implications of that book, I realized it is not a standalone. It is the first half of a duology. So my next book in the World of Eragon will be another book from Murtagh's point of view. And I do have a title for this book. But I'm not going to reveal it here. It is going to finish his storyline. There's one very specific thing that still needs to be resolved with Murtagh. As well as addressing a number of the questions that were left unanswered at the end of Murtagh. You are going to see on the page, in person, in the flesh so to speak, Uvek and Roran. Uvek, Roran, and Murtagh are going to have to deal with a very difficult situation. Murtagh has dealt with a lot of difficult situations, and he's in a better place now, although not perfect. And I envision this book as a much more focused adventure story, while still dealing with some deep themes as well. If I say any more than that, I think I'm gonna regret it. So that's my teaser for the upcoming book: the sequel to Murtagh. Now I have to go write it. I hope you enjoy it once it comes out.* [16]

> *Here's the basic premise. As you may recall, Uvek and Murtagh are now blood brothers. So the book starts with Murtagh receiving a message from Uvek asking for his help. And of course, Murtagh is a man of honor, and he goes to help. As does Thorn. As for what happens after that? For that, you're gonna have to read the book.* [16]

> *Eragon WILL be in this book.* [R]

> *I just released a teaser on social media teasing to all my fans, teasing and actually giving a little bit of a preview of the setup for the next book in the World of Eragon. I'm excited for writing that.* [17]

> **I’m so excited for Murtagh 2. That said, I don’t know how I feel about concluding Azlagûr’s storyline in just 2 books. It seems too few.**  
> *It will not be concluded in just 2 books.* [R]

**Tales 2**

> **Is there room in your creative life for writing that doesn't have a contract attached to it?**  
> *I'll tell you a secret, don't tell anyone else. I'm actually not under contract for anything basically. Actually there's one small contract I have with random house, but it almost doesn't count. Don't tell Random House that. But I hate writing to contract. I did it for 10 years. I'm not in a position where I need to do it.* [4]

> **There’s this growing genre of fantasy fiction right now, cozy fantasy, where you have a fantasy world, but the characters are just sitting around in the coffee shop drinking coffee and talking about life. Would you consider writing something in either the World of Eragon or Fractalverse which has a similar cozy vibe to it?**  
> *Maybe… but I tend to like stories about exceptional events, epic stories. Fractal Noise is kind of the biggest divergence from what I normally write. When I do Tales from Alagaësia vol. 2, there might be some more of the type of story you’re talking about, but the stories that have always appealed to me as an audience has always been epic stories, big stories. And that’s what I’m drawn to writing.* [5]


**Children's Books**

> *Sometimes I do things for fun, like last week I wrote a children's book in iambic pentameter. I don't know if it'll ever get published. It's with my agent right now. I just said ""Why not, I'll write this."" I've been reading so many books to my kids, that I was like ""You know what, I've got an idea, I'm just gonna sit down and do this."" Rhyming iambic pentameter, no less.*  
> **Is this the baby Saphira book?**  
> *No it's not actually, it's a new one that's been bouncing around my head and I just knocked it out. The baby Saphira is still in the docket, I just have got to sort of clear my schedule with these scripts that got dumped on me in the past few months.* [4]

**Brom**

> **Have you thought about writing a prequel about [Galbatorix's] insurrection?**  
> *Oh yes. It would be from Brom's point of view and would tell his story. It's all plotted out. I just have to write the darn thing.* [6]

> **Do you have any plans for maybe a prequel book about Glaedr and Oromis?**  
> *No, no, of course not. The prequel book is about Brom.* [10]

**Book Six**

> *The reason I didn't want to jump too far into the future of my timeline [for Murtagh] is because then I would have gone past the point where they have that personal journey. There are other stories that I plan to tell in this world, and I didn't want to run into them.* [13]

**Eragon/Arya**

> **Will there be another book where Eragon is the main character?**  
> *Yes.* [R]

> *I think that when writing Eragon again, I'll be looking for his own growth. That's something that will happen, because he's now in a leadership position and he has to do adult things in a way that he hasn't had to do before, in terms of managing bureaucracy and people and teaching. And he'll mature in many ways as a result of that. But of course, the thing is that he's already an adult by the end of Inheritance. He just lacks experience. And that will be interesting to write, too.* [13]

> **Will you be writing from Arya’s perspective whenever you write the next book?**  
> *No, not in the next book, but I have a book planned that’s about 50% her point of view. So I just got to get there.* [5]

**Star Sapphire**

> *Oh . . . I just solved a major worldbuilding problem in #Elëa that's been bothering me for DECADES. Oh yeah. Inconsistency ironed out and awesomeness achieved (for an upcoming story)!!!! Hint: it involves a certain star sapphire . . .* [T]

**TTRPG**

> **If you do go the TTRPG route Christopher, try and build it using D&D 3.5e as a base and use a psionics-esque magic system with a spell points/mana system instead of spell slots.**  
> *Nah. We have a completely custom engine for the TTRPG. Has nothing to do with DnD. And looks like we may have just found a publisher for it. Fun times.* [R]

> *At some point, when I have the time (ha!), I'm going to sit down and name EVERYTHING on the map. I have a lot of the names already, but putting them all in is going to be a massive, MASSIVE task.* [T]

> *I've filled out the lore for the whole world. In fact, over the next year or so, one of my projects is to sit down and actually write in all the names on the map. There are a LOT.* [R]

**Fractalverse**

> *From here on out, I would be very happy alternating between Fractalverse and World of Eragon, just bouncing between the two of them. And I'm doing a lot in the Fractalverse that just is not apparent to the readers, and I'm doing a lot in the World of Eragon that is not apparent to readers either.* [4] 

> **What do you think your next literary projects will be?**  
> *I'm really excited about the prospect of writing another Fractalverse book and then returning to the world of Eragon. My goal is to alternate between both universes for the rest of my life. I'm looking forward to writing more fiction again.* [13]

> *I am planning on writing more Fractalverse books, and that may be what I do next.* [16]

> *I'm also excited for writing more books in my science fiction universe.* [17]

> **I’m ready for a ten book space EPIC. Every page of To Sleep was unexpected and riveting, and I need a thousand more years of this please.**  
> *Seven, not ten. lol.* [T]

> *[To Sleep] was incredibly painful because the size of the book is massive. And so I would edit 400 pages and I'm like, ""I'm not even halfway through the book. I just finished a book. I'm not halfway through the book."" Which is why future books will be split in two or shorter, hopefully.* [10]

**To Sleep Sequel**

> *I got to knock out the sequel to To Sleep.* [4]

> *The Fractalverse includes the real world. If I want to go write a Tom Clancy style thriller tomorrow I could and put it in the Fractalverse.* [4]

> *There is a sequel to To Sleep in a of Stars that I want to write.* [6]

> **Are you going to work on a sequel for To Sleep in a Sea of Stars?**  
> *Yes, sequel is planned. I just have to write the darned thing!* [R]

**Patterns of Meaning**

> *I decided to consolidate all of my lore into a single document. It's, uh ... at a 150 pgs and rapidly expanding.*  
> *My, uh, lore document is now ... 221 pgs and growing. Sigh. Maybe I should start calling this a book. (And no, it's not for publication.)*  
> **WHY???**  
> *Because it spoils EVERYTHING.*  
> **Uhm, are Eagle and Ainsley to blame for distracting you from writing the next book?**  
> *Let's just say that our conversations were the catalyst I needed to write down all the various worldbuilding thoughts/plans/ideas I've had scattered across a dozen different notebooks over the past twenty years. That and trying to explain a few of these ideas to my publicist while touring for the Deluxe Edition of Murtagh. I wanted to have one cohesive document to show him.*  
> **The Chrismarillion**  
> *Lol. Not quite. I titled the document: ""Patterns of Meaning"" Make of that what you will. :D* [T]

**Standalones**

> **Do you still get to write just for the joy of telling a story even if it's just for you?**  
> *Always. I wouldn't do it otherwise. Do I want to write things outside of the Fractalverse and World of Eragon? Sure, and I probably will at some point. But I love both of those settings. I created them with love and to get to play in them is not a constraint. The stories I want to tell in both those worlds are the stories I truly care about.* [4]

**Ghostwriters**

> **Would you be open to ever in the future opening up the World of Eragon or Fractalverse for other writers to come in and write?**  
> *I’ve considered it. I did look at it one point, especially when I was trying to figure out if I could get Murtagh out the door when I wanted to get it out. The problem is I, for good or for ill, have a specific writing style which doesn’t necessarily read like any other author at the moment. It may be something I do down the road, but at the moment I’m still at a stage in my career where I’m just continuing to build the world and building the story of both the Fractalverse and the World of Eragon. That’s something I want to maintain control over.* [5]

**Future Editions and Merch**

> **Would we ever get the entire Inheritance Cycle in the same style [as the Murtagh Deluxe]?**  
> *Probably not exactly like this. We did deluxe editions of all of the other books back in the day. This continuing in that tradition.* [T]

> *Working on an amazing deluxe edition of To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, but it's pretty far out.* [T]

> *This statue is hopefully only the beginning of the all the cool stuff that Wraithmarked and I have planned, but we are thrilled that this is where we've chosen to start.* [14]

> *If there ever are more figures or statues of Saphira or Eragon it will likely be licensed merch that I'm not in control of and that I'm not producing. Which doesn't mean it won't be good, it just will be produced in a different fashion.* [Y]

> **I really wish you'd release the STLs for the figures, I'd rather print my own than have the injected plastic.**  
> *I'd love to, but the rights situation with Disney means I can't.* [T]

> **There no reason they couldn't also include a set of STL files for those with 3d printers.**  
> *It would violate the rights agreement I have with Disney if we offered the STL files for general distribution.* [R]

> **What would it take to get a World of Eragon Magic the Gathering set?**  
> *I own all publishing rights, but in this case, would probably need Disney to give the okay. Not even sure how to go about making it happen. If Wizards of the Coast was interested, I'd certainly be interested as well. And yes, the point about the IC not being as large of an IP as they normally work with is a fair point. Might change if the Disney show happens, though. (And to be fair, Murtagh has spent seven months on the NY Times list, so the fandom is alive and well).* [R]

> *Btw, as of yet, my team and I haven't been able to find a manufacturer/company who can make us an Elëa globe. If anyone has any ideas, feel free to let me know.* [T]

> *I should do an HD map of Palencar Valley.* [T]

> **Please no NFT.**  
> *Never.* [T]

**Owlcrate Editions**

> **We had a number of conversations and one of them was that we would really like to do an edition of Eragon. It's a special edition I don't think in a way that anyone else has done it before. We put together artists that we thought that you would love and presented them to you. And I art directed a cover and a back cover that I just felt on a soul level was just ""Eragon"". It was a fan service for everyone who has ever loved dragons and your work.**  
> *Well, I'll just say you nailed it. The fan service landed. I love it, but I'm biased. I love all of my covers. I've been lucky to have some really iconic and striking covers over the years. But for all of that, none of them have really captured the dragon Saphira the way I've imagined her. This comes real close. I just love it. And I love the quote on the back as well, and of course the art throughout the book. I think people are going to just absolutely love this. The stenciled edges. This is just a pretty, pretty, pretty book.*  
> **I can't wait to work with you on the rest of the Inheritance series, because we're going to continue doing that.** [8]



# Adaptations

> *Disney Plus is in the process of hopefully launching a big budget television adaptation of Eragon, which I am executive producing and cowriting. And I'm also doing the same for a television adaptation of To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, and between that, books, and children, I don't know what sleep is.* [7]

**News**

> **Is there any new news on the Disney Plus series?**  
> *There should be a major announcement coming soon, but it's out of my control as to when exactly that announcement happens, because corporations.* [4] 

> *We shall see. Exciting stuff going on, though. I'm having to switch into full flower-sniffer mode again (not that I ever really stopped). ... Can't say, but hope to have big news in the next week or so. Exciting stuff. ... Still in the works. Things are hopping, folks. I am EXCITED. ... 👍🐉🔥🏰‼️* [T]

> *Your patience will be rewarded. 😎* [T]

> *Things are happening. A LOT of things.* [T]

> *Things are happening and hopefully we will actually have a decision in the next couple of months whether or not the first season actually gets greenlit or not. And if it gets greenlit, the news will be everywhere. So that's where we're at.* [10]

> *There have been quite a few things happening behind the scenes, and I wish I could talk about them, but if I do, Disney's gonna come yelling at me, and you don't wanna anger the Mouse House, as they say. But the show is continuing to be in development. It's very exciting at the moment and I hope to have something more to say about it in the near future.*  [11]

> *I'm knee-deep in it, and it's been a great fun experience so far.* [12]

> **""For Christmas I want a Dragon!"" ""Be realistic"" ""I want news about the Eragon show"" ""What color do you want your dragon?""**  
> *Lol. I actually sent this to the folks I'm working with over at Disney.* [T]

> *The series is moving forward. We hope to hear soon whether or not the first season will be approved. So that's been encouraging.* [13]

> *That's the way it is with Hollywood. It's easy to run around excited and say, oh, this is happening or that is happening, but sometimes it doesn't happen or it falls through. And the conversations you have with other creatives and professionals in the entertainment industry, whether it's publishing or Hollywood, kind of need to be confidential unless everyone is happy to have it out in public. And that's again, because things change, or you just say things in confidence and or in private with someone and trust that it will remain private. So these things don't really get talked about until it's actually happening and everyone's on board and it's like, okay, now we can have a press release, now we can have interviews, now we can build everyone's excitement up. And hopefully we're getting pretty close there with Eragon.* [11]

> **I wasn't aware that To Sleep in a Sea of Stars was being adapted.**  
> *Yeah, it's currently under development with a paired up production company. The first company is Made Up Stories, the other one's called Snoot Entertainment. And we've been going around for a little while, really getting the right form for what we think is gonna be a television adaptation of To Sleep in the Sea of Stars. We just had some super exciting news on that front. But again, I can't say anything about it, which is incredibly frustrating. But again, hopefully in the near future.* [11]

> *Just turned in revisions on scripts for To Sleep as well, so that's exciting.* [T]


**Screenwriting**

> *I have been working quite a lot on scripts this past month and a half or so. A lot actually. If anyone wants to draw some inferences from that they can. I think I did almost 30 pages in the last three days. ... So I've been working really really hard on that. And getting there. And getting there.* [4]

> *I cannot tell you what's been going on behind the scenes, aside from to tell you the fact that I have personally written four scripts this year, which is why there isn't a new book this year.* [10]

> *I was hoping to write another book this year, but I have actually had all of my time chewed up by the deluxe edition of Murtagh, which comes out October 15th. I've done quite a bit of content for that. And then I've been working on scripts this year. Scripts for Eragon, scripts for To Sleep in a Sea of Stars, couple of side projects that I've got going as well. I've been learning how to be a good screenwriter and it's been a fun, fun experience.* [11]

> *It's funny, writing scripts takes a lot of time, just like writing books.* [12]

> *I've written a number of television episodes at this point, or versions of various episodes, and I've always hit my length, I'm not running long, which is good. So I've adapted fairly well to the length requirements, especially given that I did a version of a film script for Eragon back in like 2003 or 2004 [2002]. I think it was like 270 [213] pages or something, so I've gotten better at the length.* [4]

> **What have you learned from your foray into screenwriting?**  
> *I think the biggest thing I've learned is just a little more flexibility in terms of how to depict information, how to convey those visuals, and also trying to be a little more concise, because scripts are essentially outlines, all things considered. No one really cares about the quality of that prose a whole lot, so the descriptions are fairly bare bones. What needs to be as good as possible ultimately is the structure and then the dialogue, because the dialogue will be spoken by the actors or some version of it. Now conversely, I have seen novels written by screenwriters who've gone the opposite direction, and sometimes they run into the problem where their novels feel very bare bones because they're so used to stripping things down. So trying to balance it both ways.* [4]

> *Outlining is actually how I approach screenwriting and it's serving me very well at the moment because I'm working on a couple of scripts that are pretty intense.* [4]

> **Have you learned things from screenwriting that then affect your novel writing brain, or are there tools from novel writing that you've brought into screenwriting? How do they differ but how are they the same?**  
> *I think television is probably more novelistic than film just because there's more space and time to tell the stories over the over multiple episodes. I think one of the things is that film and television perhaps feels a bit more free to hop around visually, which is something that could be confusing to a reader. It's something writers used to do a little bit more of when the omniscient point of view was more popular. I have a deluxe edition of Murtagh, and I wrote some additional scenes for it. The stuff I wrote actually uses some of the techniques that I've been using in the scripts I've been working with, so I'll be curious how people respond to that. It's a little bit more of the if a character is looking at something then sometimes you do a little flashback, inspired by the thing that the character's looking at. I think it works well, albeit it's not something I've done in the Inheritance Cycle before, but again it fit what I was trying to do.* [4]

**Changes**

> **What does it mean to you to be so involved this time?**  
> *For me, the main reason for being involved, and what I hope to achieve by being involved, is to try to capture the essence of the story. There's no way to adapt a book into a movie or a TV series without making a lot of changes. It's a necessity. Even if I had all the money and all the skill in the world, there's no way I could just take Eragon and film it page by page. No one who would watch that. So changes have to be made. But with my involvement, I want to make sure that the core essence of the story is preserved, because people enjoy it for the characters and the events they experience and the meaning those events have, along with what the characters take away from them. So preserving that is important. It's also the hardest thing to do, because successfully conveying a certain feeling or emotion to your audience is incredibly difficult with something as subjective as art. That's why ideas are easy to convey, but emotions are hard. And that's what I really hope to preserve: the characters and the emotions.* [13]

> *You have to make adaptations to go from book to television. I think the biggest difference is that in a book you can jump into someone's mind, and you can experience their feelings that way. With television or film you have to find ways to show that, which necessitates certain changes, but all of that to serve the same story and the characters in the world.* [12]

**Episodes**

> **Have they find out how many episodes there are going to be or have they chosen the directors?**  
> *No comment.* [11]

**Animation**

> **Have you ever considered doing it through animation instead of doing it with live-action?**  
> *In many cases, we the creators don't actually have a lot of say in the type of adaptation. If Disney or another studio has optioned or bought the rights to that property, it's really their choice as to how they're going to adapt it. In the case of Eragon, Disney wants a live action adaptation. Which to be fair, is also what I want, but I love animation. It could certainly be done beautifully in animation. I have no reservations there. But it's not my choice ultimately. Because they're the ones who have to cut the checks and spend the ridiculous amount of money to put dragons on screen. So if they want to do that I'm happy.* [7]

**Cameos**

> **Would you like to do a cameo in any adaptation of yours?**  
> *So the funny thing is I was supposed to have a cameo in the film that wasn't made, but I ended up having to be on tour for my second book at the time. I asked for and they agreed that they were going to fly me out to Budapest where they were filming, and I was going to have a cameo in the last big battle in the film. I was going to be dressed up as an Urgal, as the shortest Urgal ever, and I was going to get my head chopped off on-screen by Eragon, which absolutely delighted me. But the thing is, in the books the Urgals have horns, and if the film that wasn't made had actually been true to the book I would have had horns on my head, but instead they didn't have horns, so no. Maybe one of these days. If the television show gets off the ground, yes, you will get to see Christopher Paolini get murdered on screen. I guarantee it.* [7]

> **Were you ever on set? Did you give any recommendations to actors?**  
> *No, no. I mean, they did offer to give me a cameo in the film. They were filming over in Budapest, but I was touring for Eldest at the time. And to get over to Europe and then back with everything that was going on was just going to be too physically hard.* [11]


**The Movie**

> **How did that movie even come to be?**  
> *As Random House was preparing Eragon for publication, it actually had a lot of behind the scenes buzz that I didn't know about, and the book got shopped around in Hollywood, and we heard that Fox was interested in the book, and I was on my first book tour for Random House when they made a formal monetary offer for the book. In retrospect, part of me wishes I had waited longer for someone else to step in with the book. But the other thing is, although the film is not a great adaptation, it fueled the fan base in a way that perhaps wouldn't have happened otherwise. And in any case, my family and I were not in a financial position to be able to just walk away from that kind of money back then. So I don't feel bad about accepting the offer.* [11]

> **Did you have any say in it? Did you have a big part in it? Or were you kind of like Rick Riordan and the Percy Jackson movie and you just didn't have a say?**  
> *Well, I'll tell you a behind the scenes tidbit: a lot of the people who worked on the original Percy Jackson movies worked on Eragon. It was the same studio. Rick and I had a very similar experience. I was not really involved in the process of the film. I got to have a couple of calls with the screenwriter who was a lovely gentleman by the name of Peter Buchman. His first draft was actually quite close to the book. And then through notes from the studio and other people, it ended up evolving into the form that people are now familiar with. But again, I really had no involvement with the film, they didn't reach out to me and I really had no idea that it was actually even happening until they were just about to go into production.* [11] 

> *The one author I've met who I think is the happiest with his adaptation is Brian Selznick, who did Hugo Cabret. The book is filled with drawings that the author also produced. I asked him about that and he said ""Oh yes, Martin Scorsese just used those as storyboards and just shot those images."" He was so happy with the adaptation. He was like, ""It's perfect. It's my book!"". I'm like, ""I'm so happy for you.""* [7]

> *You wouldn't notice any dwarves or elves in the film, even though of course dwarves and elves play a major role in The Inheritance Cycle, and yet there are actors credited as dwarves and at least one elf, the elf Arya, in the movie. The reason for that is basically they got scared by Lord of the Rings. Return of the King had just come out when they started work on Eragon, and so they got scared of dwarves and elves. I wrote this long message to them and said, ""look when someone reads fantasy, assuming they're choosing to read high fantasy that has dwarves and elves and dragons, they want to actually read about those things. All of the different authors who play in this genre, we treat elves and dwarves and dragons and other creatures like there are shared ideas of what those creatures are. You can certainly deviate and create your own version of that and people do that. But if you have creatures that are called elves, there's certain things that we kind of think of as an elf, and I was very much playing in that sort of expected space with my elves and my dwarves. So I said you're going to lose your audience. You're going to anger them or disappoint them by not living up to those tropes if you will. There are unique elements to my elves and dwarves, but if you don't even acknowledge them as elves and dwarves you can't explore those unique elements because it's tied to the nature of that species.* [4]

> **Is there anything that you would take from the adaptation that didn't exist, be it the cast, be it whatever?**  
> *The actors were good. And the special effects hold up pretty well, because the director was a special effects supervisor at ILM and so had some experience with that, if not the other elements of good storytelling. And filmmaking. So I think the casting probably was some of the strongest bits of the film that doesn't exist.* [7]

**Casting**

> *RIP #DonaldSutherland Always enjoyed watching his performances. Hard to believe he was never nominated for an Academy Award.*  
> **He would have made an amazing Jeod... May he rest in peace.**  
> *YES! (or Sloan, depending what mood he was in).* [T]

> *The actors were good. But they were also cast in the wrong roles. Jeremy Irons would have been a great Durza, for example.* [7]

> **Sir Christopher Lee would have been a perfect Brom, had he lived to see the show's creation. Alas, it was not to be.**  
> *He would have been an even better Galbatorix. Imagine THAT voice convincing you that everything you believe is a lie. (Alternatively ... Glaedr!)* [T]

> **Liam Cunningham as Brom?**  
> *Now that's a good idea.* [R]

1jqhuit,https://www.reddit.com/r/VirginVoyages/comments/1jqhuit/can_anybody_explain_the_benefit_of_a_drink/,Can Anybody Explain The Benefit of a Drink Package vs. Bar Tab?,"I get that there's been a whole lot of discourse here regarding Bar Tab vs. Drink Package. I understand they may continue to offer Bar Tab (and bonuses) alongside the Drink Package (or they'll just revert to drink packages only).

But doing a simple math comparison of the bar tab vs. the $95/day packages for a four day cruise:

$95/day \* 2 people = $760

$750 Bar Tab + $175 bonus = $925 in drinks.

So in order to break even with the drink package, you need to each drink $115 per day. An example of you breaking even might look like.

3 Beers @ $9 = $27

5 Cocktails @ $13 = $65

2 Glasses of Wine @ $10 = $20

Specialty Coffee @ $6 = $6

On a four day cruise, you have a half day on first day and will likely spend some time off the ship at port (where aside from Bimini no drinks are available), it seems darn near irresponsible to have 10 drinks a day, every day. Especially when both people in a room have different drinking habits.

The Bar Tab allowed for flexibility. If Virgin is making drinks for guests (like myself) who only want a few drinks a day and also for people who need 10 drinks a day to break even, they're not likely to make them the same way as they are currently. We cruised for the first time in January and it would be a deal breaker if they permanently adopted drink packages. I didn't experience folks getting absolutely blitzed / long bar lines. And the drinks all tasted decently strong.

Just my two cents! We loved our cruise and are (rightfully) concerned at this change and what else is going to change.",9,1743685321.0,VirginVoyages,17,0.76,False

1jqhthu,https://www.reddit.com/r/seducingwomen/comments/1jqhthu/stop_being_a_secondary_character_in_your_own_life/,"Stop being a secondary character in your own life, and become the hero of your life's story!","Hi, David here!

We often perform the role of secondary characters in our own lives, doing little to impact or direct the overall plot. In some cases, we even play the part of the villain by self-sabotaging ourselves. If this sounds like you, then it’s time to recast yourself as the hero of your own life.

The hero’s journey always contains struggle. Without a struggle to overcome, you can’t even be a hero. Be glad that having something to struggle over gives you this opportunity instead of complaining about it.

There are heroic choices constantly being presented to you. Think of how a hero would act when faced by them.

Would a hero introduce himself to a cute girl sitting at a coffee shop, or choose to say nothing and have the opportunity forever slip away?

Would a hero hide his true beliefs and desires, or unapologetically let them be known?

Would a hero work to get better, or instantly give up at the first sign of defeat?

Be a catalyst for things occurring. Organize events. Be the one that asks others to join you in doing something. And if no one else wants to join an activity, be brave enough to still do it by yourself.

Don’t wait for someone or something else to save you. Do your own bit of saving.

Hard to explain bur basically just what you'd expect it to be, typical 15$ clone level ig.

Suits: never smelled tuxedo but to me suits smells like a level above the typical clone, i can see it worn daily with clean elegant style and it would seem like it's a proper 150$ designer or whatever, what I like about it is you'd be sure to be different from the blue/fresh guys and yet achieve smelling clean which is really fucking good, not obsessed with it but it gets a blind buy approval cuz it can't go wrong.

Royal blend vintage: now this one was supposed to be my new go to, royal blend the og is just a 10/10 it is top 3 in my collection so naturally I thought this would go as hard, BUT it turns out that I'm not that big of a boozy fan, from notes I imagined it to smell like a hint of liquor and focuses more on devana blended with sweetness but that's not the case, the initial whif was straight up liquor, pure dark liquor that gets you drunk, I need to wait out on it and wear it and test it's ground first but I'm 100% sure this is NOT BLIND BUY SAFE what so ever, it is unique and very different from all the shit I own  or smelled, which is what I intended when I got it, but I'm pretty skeptical that it would appeal to alot of people, I imagine it to be more like a niche pick where you know people probably won't like it but they'd see it's uniqueness, more like a daring fragrance rather than appealing, but once again I could be wrong as I imagined spectre wraith to be somewhat a daring fragrance but turns out it's just appealing to people just not the way you'd imagine, more like a respected mature type of thing, SW also smelled like play dough first I got it now it's coffee candy with splash of whiskey so  I'll give vintage the benefit of the doubt until it macerated for 2 weeks ig.


Rifaqaat: now this is the bomb of those 4, I've heard about it alot before but I never really smelled ysl perfumes other than freshness so I didn't have an image of how good this might be, just people praising babycat, and I found it for like 18$ so I said fuck it we ball, turns out this is just mad good, this one is definitely mass appealing soft sweet with a hint of darkness in a way that yes it's cozy yes it's soft and warm but at the same time it gives that I'm in for the buisness type of scent, from what I know and what fragrances appeal to women I know I guarantee this shit is going to be a bomb for attraction, it's in-between the category of fragrances that I received most of my warm weather compliments so I know imma be wearing this out,it is a blind buy safe for that price range but make sure you look like the fragrance not just smell like it, it gives you that responsible sirious man that can be a playboy but you'll never know, if that's what you want then this is what you need.

1jqhqdc,https://www.reddit.com/r/TradingAnalytics/comments/1jqhqdc/navigating_trumps_market/,Navigating Trump's Market,"Trading in the current market influenced by Trump's policies can be challenging and volatile. Here are some insights and strategies from Redditors on how to navigate this turbulent environment:

# Market Volatility and Strategies

* **Market Manipulation Concerns**: Some traders believe that Trump's actions and announcements can manipulate the market, leading to unexpected volatility. One Redditor mentioned, [""Wait for the weekly market crash, buy something, wait until the wild announcement on truth social makes everything pump again, sell, the next day everything collapses after that unnatural rise the previous day, repeat ad infinitum""](https://www.reddit.com/r/swingtrading/comments/1j2lgsh/comment/mft665p/).
* **Avoiding Overtrading**: Another trader advised, [""Risk Management. Few trades a day. Target. Short-term trading. No long term in this moment we are in. Else, u will lose a lot. Risk Management is the number one key. Don't over trade. And don't also be greedy.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jgc9s3/comment/miy5v3e/).

# Impact of Tariffs

* **Sector-Specific Effects**: Trump's tariffs have had a significant impact on various sectors. For instance, [""Will impact everything. Every raw material, from iron ore to rubber, silica, coffee, rare earths, wood, cocoa just went up in price by 20%.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/1johy3a/comment/mkrxbdm/).
* **Consumer Prices and Demand**: There are concerns that tariffs will lead to higher consumer prices and lower demand. ""Will it lead to lower consumer demand in an already weak US consumer?"".

# Psychological and Behavioral Aspects

* **Mental Resilience**: New traders are advised to focus on fundamentals and risk management to avoid being swayed by market noise. [""What I'd advise you to do is focus more on fundamentals. Go through news, know how a currency's economy is doing, know how the geopolitical tensions are affecting safe haven inflows, watch equities, commodity prices and stocks; be keen on rumours, things like BoJ rate hike expectations, US Recession fears etc.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jgc9s3/comment/miy3g7g/).
* **Avoiding Emotional Trading**: One trader shared, [""The markets may have been tricky to navigate these last weeks if you’re a beginner. Don’t be to hard on yourself and learn. See where price reacts on HTFS and backtest and take notes.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/Forex/comments/1jgc9s3/comment/mixzqgy/).

# Community Insights

* **Skepticism and Criticism**: Many Redditors are skeptical about the long-term benefits of Trump's policies. [""Trump honestly believes that the money taken in as tax revenue from the tariffs is somehow extracted from the other country. This isn't true, the money comes from US citizens, but he is too senile to grasp that.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/centrist/comments/1j4j3dl/comment/mg91ghn/).
* **Historical Context**: Some users draw parallels with past economic policies, [""I guess most people on here are too young to remember when manufacturers, concerned about profits, outsourced or moved all of their manufacturing off-shore to cut costs.""](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/1jppeip/comment/ml16to6/).",1,1743685030.0,TradingAnalytics,1,1.0,False

This is going to be stupid and yes it’s going to be long and It’s probably not going to make much sense because I’m unloading in a way but my boyfriend is destroying me slowly. It sounds ridiculous but it’s the only way I can put it. 

I’m not sure what it is. I really don’t know. I think it’s because I’m not naturally beautiful, or that I don’t have big tits or fat ass. I’m really just blatantly average. I’m just a girl with my heart on my sleeve, a girl who loves a man that makes me continually feel like the ugly girl in highschool who’s chasing the guy that gives his attention to all the prettier girls. I genuinely can’t remember the last time this man has said he loves me. The last time he has given me a compliment in ANY sense - appearance, cooking, etc - but when he likes an actress or singer or coworker or neighbour or pretty much any other woman that is not me, he has no problem being the nicest funniest guy on the planet. No problem giving compliments then. 

And god, don’t get me wrong. I don’t really fucking need a compliment everyday to feel happy in my relationship. That isn’t what this is about and God knows I’ve made due for the past 10 years without any, but it’s everything else together that just makes it worse. 

My boyfriend and I live together. We have four dogs. I do literally everything around the house while still going to work everyday. Everything. Dishes, cooking, laundry, cleaning, taking out the garbage, shovelling snow, paying the bills and buying the groceries. I ask this man for one thing, maybe take out the garbage for me? Nah. He’d rather sit on his phone in bed in the morning, looking at porn. Who cares that this one little thing would make my girlfriend’s life easier? (so disgustingly unattractive)

I’m so fucking frustrated and just so fucking sad. My bf will watch these reels of girls packing their man’s lunches and he’ll send them to me as if I HAVENT BEEN DOING THAT FOR 10 YEARS 😭 The comments are always full of men singing praises for the women and wishing they had their own. Calling it marriage material and yet I’m still ringless LOL. I go above and fucking beyond for this man, because holy fuck all I want to do is care for him and my love language is acts of service just because to me it’s always about the little things that really speak volumes towards how much you love someone. How much effort you’re willing to put into loving them fully. 

And this is the part where i start sobbing because Im so fucking broken if he even started my car (to warm up given we live in a freezer state) in the morning I’d be over the moon. Me? It’s 7am and Im making him coffee and breakfast bringing it up to him in bed i’m packing his lunch im starting his car im cleaning the snow off I’m taking out prep for dinner im running to the store if needed etc etc etc. 

As I get older I just want to nurture. Idk. I want to take care of this man I want to be his sanctuary, I want him to feel like anything he needs he’s got it, but this dude does absolutely nothing to deserve it and it’s heartbreaking for me to say that. He tells me he goes to work for us but sorry man, that isn’t an excuse for slacking off in your relationship. That’s just a lazy way of saying you don’t actually give a fuck about me or how I feel. Which became glaringly apparent when on my birthday in Feb, this man did and said nothing to me other than a birthday snapchat filter. 

I don’t get it. I shouldn’t have to beg my boyfriend to tell me he loves me when i do fucking everything for him 😭 He tells me I should be his peace when I’m nagging, but fucking christ can you take a look around for five fucking minutes? You are giving me zero fucking reason to feel safe here, to feel loved here, to feel wanted here, to feel cared for here, to feel ANYTHING that doesn’t resemble a fucking abused pet. Neglected. 

I’ve always been independent. Always been the type to just do everything myself because It’s that sick sad part of me that’s quietly desperate for validation and appreciation. I had a shitty upbringing. Absent father. This feels a lot like chasing that acceptance from my father that never came, but on a scale so much worse, and truly I am just so devastated. I just feel that inner child breaking a little more every day. 

Anyways, sorry you had to read that. I’m a sad pathetic woman right now and just needed somewhere to unload it. ",4,1743684988.0,offmychest,1,1.0,False

1jqhlfr,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1jqhlfr/am_i_overreacting/,Am I Overreacting?,"I'm coming up on 2 years of living with one of my friends. We work together (but don't really see each other at work), and occasionally hang out outside of work. She bought a house about 2 years ago and was looking for a roommate. I was finally making enough money to move out of my parents' house, but couldn't afford to live on my own. I thought this would be a great deal as she wouldn't charge pet rent for my dog, and we'd be living in a house with a yard for our dogs. However, I should have taken the state of the previous apartment she lived in as a warning. 

I grew up with a clean freak mother so I prefer having a clean house. While I'm not as OCD as my mother and I let my bedroom get a little messy sometimes on busy weeks, I do think it is important that shared spaces (living room, kitchen, etc.) are kept clean out of respect to everyone else living there. 

So long story short, my roommate has zero respect when it comes to keeping the communal spaces clean. The kitchen constantly has trash sitting around - empty dog food cans sit on the counter for days, aluminum foil she puts in the toaster oven sits on the counter with crumbs on it for days, parchment paper with crumbs on it for days, empty soda cans, and trash. The trash can is 3 steps away. The counters never get wiped down when she cooks and gets crumbs all over. She lets pans with crusted on food sit in the kitchen for days before cleaning them (sometimes they're my pans!) The thing that bothers me the most - the CLUTTER EVERYWHERE. You can't see the surface of our kitchen table because it's filled with all her clutter/trash. Can't see the surface of the coffee table in the living room because it's full of clutter/trash. Any time she's at home, all she does is sit on MY couch and watch TV. She has plenty of time to wash her dishes and clean up her mess/throw things in the trash. And I won't even get into about how she wants to keep the AC on 80 degrees in the summer. 

I was extremely bothered to learn that the other day at work, she went up to my coworkers and complained that I had a CLEAN pot sitting on the drying rack for 2 days, and she was NOT going to put it away. Meanwhile, one of her pans has been sitting in the kitchen with crusted on eggs for five days, a pot has been sitting on the counter with crusted on food for 6 days, there's empty dog food cans, clutter, empty soda cans, and trash everywhere. But my ONE CLEAN pan was such a burden to her that she went and complained about me to my coworkers???? Are you serious???? 

I feel like it's difficult to talk to her about her mess because she owns the house. But also, I pay good money to live there and it's just disrespectful at this point to make me live in her clutter. I love to cook but I hate cooking in this kitchen because it's always a mess. I can't even use the living room because all the clutter around me gives me anxiety. I can't even invite friends over to the house because I'm so embarrassed and idk how she isn't embarrassed of herself.

1jqhl96,https://i.redd.it/oer3ysho9mse1.jpeg,Help with blood work,"Hi all, I’m 33(M) only on carnivore for 6 weeks. I was diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis a couple of years ago and recently diagnosed with Crohn’s disease. I didn’t want to go down the medication route straight away so I said I’d give this ago. Since staring the diet I feel great, little to no joint pain and my bowl movements have improved significantly after the initial two week bedding in period. 

I’ve been pretty strict, I have reintroduced one coffee in the morning, more so to up my fat intake by adding butter to it. I’m primarily eating ground beef and rib eyes. I’ve had a some eggs, bacon, chicken wings and fish as well. 

My wife is supportive but she did ask to get my bloods checked. I know 6 weeks is probably too soon but is there anything I should be concerned about? The units are different to what I’ve seen elsewhere in the forum so any help would be greatly appreciated. 

Thanks

To maintain both style and functionality, prioritize key pieces that serve multiple purposes. For example, in a small living room, a sectional sofa with hidden storage or a coffee table that doubles as a bench can optimize utility without cluttering the area.

Maintaining an open layout is essential—ensure there’s enough space for smooth movement to avoid creating an obstacle course. Stick to a minimalist approach by choosing a few statement pieces that define the room’s aesthetic rather than filling every corner with décor. Light-colored furniture and mirrors can also enhance the perception of space, making a room feel airy and open.

At **Design Science**, we specialize in crafting interiors that balance comfort and spaciousness. Our expert space planning ensures that every piece is placed thoughtfully, making your home feel both stylish and breathable, free from unnecessary clutter.",1,1743684502.0,designscienceinterior,0,1.0,False

I check my phone again. 8:48 AM. I look up at a digital billboard—it still says 8:46 AM.

The glitch is getting worse.

**9:30 AM**

At work, everything is too perfect. Every keyboard clack is rhythmic. Every conversation blends into the background. The fluorescent lights don’t even flicker anymore.

It’s trying to convince me nothing is wrong.

I sit down at my desk, trying to act natural. But the moment I touch my keyboard, my screen flickers.

For a second, I see a blank email draft open on my monitor. The cursor blinks in the subject line- sender \[202200668\].

Then it’s gone. Replaced with my normal inbox.

My hands tighten into fists.

It’s erasing him.

Before I can react, my coworker—David—turns to me with a smile.

“Hey,” he says, voice too light. “You’re looking a little stressed. You okay?”

I stare at him. David never talks to me.

Never.

“Yeah,” I say slowly. “Just tired.”

He nods, his smile not quite right. “You should get some rest. You work too hard.”

I don’t answer.

His smile lingers a second too long.

Then he turns back to his screen like nothing happened.

I don’t move. I barely breathe.

""shit...It’s watching me"".

I sighed.

Lunchtime. The office empties out as people head downstairs. I stay at my desk, pretending to work. My fingers hover over the keyboard, my mind racing.

202200668 fought back. He tried everything. But he gave up after a week.

I won’t.

I reach for my phone to check my notes—

Static.

A low, droning noise fills the office. My ears ring. My vision blurs.

I grip the edge of my desk, trying to steady myself. The sound is inside my head.

Then, faintly—beneath the static—

A voice.

Not from any direction. Not from the speakers. Inside my skull.



ＳĪ̶̡͖̻̪̘̦̜͖̒͑̄̍͆͛̈́̚͝Ṫ̵̞̩͎̯̖̬͎̹̝̊̐̏͑͛͗̍̚͘̚ ̷̪̻̻̘͇̜̹̏̊̅̀̾̎̎̏̿̈́̕͜Ṡ̷̡̤͕̦͖̲͊̄̔͋͐̄̑͘̚͜͜T̸̜̘̪͕̜̻̻̼̜͎͌̿̔̏̍̽̀̚̚͠Ȉ̵̺̳͚̯̞̓̍̊̑̋̈́̎̍͒L̷̡̰̹̲̥̩̝̉̒̊̽̄͒̏̋̃̄̿͜L̸̡̻̼̪̲͇̈́̈́̎͊̿̽͗̀̅͝.̴̰̙͙̝̖̬̒͛̈́̓͆̇̎̇͋͠



I snap up, heart hammering.

The static stops.

The office is normal again.

People are talking. Phones are ringing.

But my hands are ice cold.

 

**Later in the afternoon…**

 

I reach the coffee shop window—the same one from this morning.

My hands tremble as I take a slow breath, preparing myself.

I have to look.

I stare into the glass, letting the reflection settle.

The city behind me is perfect. The cars move in flawless synchronization, the pedestrians glide past without hesitation. Nothing is out of place.

But beyond it—past the reflection—

I see the house.

The gray horizon.

And this time, he’s not sitting.

He’s running.

My stomach lurches.

202200668, the man who once sat in defiance for an eternity, is unstill now.... he is moving again.

His body moves with a frantic, desperate energy—sprinting toward the endless horizon, his breaths ragged, his arms pumping. He is trying to escape.

I watch, frozen, as he keeps running, keeps trying.

But I already know how this ends.

He won’t make it. He never did.

Eventually, he will stop.

He will sit.

And he will wait for eternity.

Thinking for a moment my throat tightens. This isn’t just a glitch—this is something worse.

“This…. is the past.”

The reflection is showing me what happened before he gave up.

The moment that led him to become part of the stillness.

I spin around—but the city is normal. No house. No empty void. Just the bright, noisy streets, full of people who don’t know they aren’t real.

I look back at the reflection—

He’s still there. Still running.

My breath catches. I am watching history repeat itself.

And I realize something terrifying.

If I don’t break the cycle—one day, someone else will be watching me.

\-----------

I can’t move.

I watch the reflection as he keeps running. His movements are frantic, desperate—but his face… his body… they don’t show any signs of exhaustion.

No gasping. No slowing down.

Because he can’t feel tired.

The realization sends a chill up my spine.

His arms pump, his legs move, his body performs the actions of struggle. But there’s no cost. No burning lungs, no aching muscles. Just motion.

Motion without meaning.

I know how this ends.

At some point, he will stop. Not because he’s exhausted—because he realizes it doesn’t matter.

And then he will sit.

And once he sits, he will never move again.

I feel sick.

I’m not watching a man fight for his life. I’m watching the exact moment he realizes he never had a chance.

The system wants me to see this.

But why?

I scan the reflection, trying to focus—not on him, but on everything else.

There has to be something.

A flaw. A crack. A mistake.

How did he fail?

My fingers tighten into fists. I stare at the pattern of his running. The way he moves. The way he chooses his direction.

And then…

I see it.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



Instinct. The most human response. When we escape, we run away.

But what if that’s the trap?

What if this place.... this purgatory.... is designed to absorb forward motion?

What if the only way out isn’t to run away—but to move in a way it doesn’t expect?

A sharp breath shudders through me.

The purgatory thrives on patterns. Routine. Repetition. Even rebellion is something it has prepared for.

The previous MC fought—but he fought the way it expected him to.

And that’s why he failed.

I look down at my shaking hands.

If I want to break out…

I have to be unpredictable.

This week has been terrible. I have either eaten at maintenance or gone over. 

SO dog had passed away and I spent 2 days with her at her family’s house. So between work and cooking food it wasn’t much of an option. I picked up food for their family, and then the day the dog was put down I took my SO and her dad out to dinner. 

Both of those days just had me not really check my calories too much. I was at and it over maintenance. 

Additionally, just yesterday I worked a double shift. 7 am to 1am. Awful, and the only thing I could do as I was tired was have something to munch on. Luckily it wasn’t super unhealthy. Beef jerky. But I was over my maintenance by at least 1,000 calories. Miserable day at work.

And now this morning I’m getting my usual coffee and breakfast that I get myself. I won’t be over with this. But I can probably eat a healthy dinner and be okay. Issue is I work tonight again until 2 am. 

Not at work now, but I am up early because my body is just used to being up at this time. Doesn’t care how long I worked yesterday. So another long day.

So I got fired from a job in January after three weeks of training and this is like the fourth time I've been fired right when training ends because I needed more time than I was given. I attribute this to my many learning disabilities. I've also quit quite a few jobs while manic, which I didn't realize was why I was doing it until I was diagnosed about two months ago with Bipolar2. I have also avoided certain jobs because of chronic pain and hypermobility in my joints so my options have always been limited as far as potential jobs go.

As of right now, I'm not looking for work and I'm not in school. I was in community college for a couple weeks but had to drop out for the second time because I couldn't comprehend any of my classes. I felt really stupid for this, but that's not the point. I live with my mom, rent free, so I realize how priviledged I am in that but I've been struggling my whole life with these issues and I'll be 35 next month. I'm tired of having to rely on my mom for shit I should be able to take care of myself. 

I'm in the process of getting on the right med for my bipolar and the PA that handles my med management suggests getting a new evaluation for all of my learning disabilities and any that may have been missed when I was in middle school be put on hold until my bipolar is under control, because while I've always known that I had ADHD, among other things, that could have been the focus issues with Bipolar doing the talking.

My point: I don't know how to explain my situation to people because I'm embarassed by it. When a new friend asks to meet for coffee I don't know how to politely decline without revealing that I can't afford a $4 coffee because I'm completely broke because I'm too dumb to hold a job. (I'm sorry if this wording seems harsh but it's genuinely how I feel about myself right now, not about learning disabilities and mental health disorders in general.) I feel like when I try to explain I just sound like a freeloader. Any insight is appreciated. Thanks.",3,1743684012.0,disability,2,1.0,False

As the hummingbirds start their migration north, I want to give a heads up on attaching a nectar feeder to your cam feeders. I did this last year hoping to capture a hummingbird on video. To my dismay, I found out that raccoons  also love nectar. One night I had a raccoon visit the and nearly destroyed it, chewing the antenna clean off  and all the wires to the external solar panel. 

I ended up just putting a single hummingbird feeder off my deck on a hook. I was able to enjoy visits from hummingbirds all summer, just sitting there in the morning having my coffee. I still brought it in every night, only put in small amounts of nectar for the day and cleaned and replaced nectar maybe every couple days. 

I live in upstate New York and the migration of the hummingbirds will start showing up towards the end of the month here. I was able to replace the antenna and fix and shield all wires. The raccoon luckily didn’t damaged the camera or perch. I know we all have spent a good amount of money on these camera feeder’s only to be destroyed.

Itinerary in Korea

5 Days in Seoul, 2 days in Busan, and 2 days on Jeju Island

1. In Seoul we dd two tours, both were great. A [Small Group City Tour](https://www.viator.com/tours/Seoul/Travel-for-foodies-Seoul-Highlight-Tour/d973-42053P12) and a [DMZ Tour](https://www.viator.com/tours/Seoul/DMZ-Peace-Finder-Private-Tour-North-Korea-Invasion-Route-and-Suspension-Bridge/d973-47013P20). Of our three week trip, our days in Seoul were out favorite and these tours were two of our favorite experiences. Seoul when we went was not full tourist at all and experience the culture was easy.
2. Busan was amazing. So beautiful! We went to all the normal sites, but a highlight for us was hiking at the Oryukdo. We love hiking and being active and that was a great way to end out time in Busan.
3. JeJu island was beautiful. We rented a taxi for the day, which was reasonable, and if we had not I am not sure how we would have seen the island at all. We could not do much at the beach because of weather and everything was spread out from where we stayed at Seogwipo-si. We were also there just before other tourist would be there, which oddly made the experience a little off. Not sure how to explain that. I had my best drink of the trip near our hotel at the great coffee shop [Bunker House](https://g.co/kgs/vWbijNe) which is on a beautiful rocky beach.

Things I Learned:

1. Take an external battery. I was skeptical about this but E-sims kill your battery and when you are using your maps all day--it is a lot!
2. There is a coffee shop every ten feet, just espresso stuff but the Americano's were consistently great and I am very snobby about coffee--I was worried about this before we left.
3. Transit system is unbelievable and easy--You have to use NAVAR Maps especially for walking instructions where Google Maps is useless
4. We don't eat fast food, but Mcdonalds, Burger King, and KFC are worshipped here and their locations are immaculate.
5. There are ZERO trashcans anywhere. I was walking around with an empty coffee cup for hours I think multiple times. It becomes clear that people do not walk and eat/drink which is actually refreshing.
6. National Geographic, Panam, and Discovery CLOTHING everywhere--they LOVE brands.
7. Gotcha Shops (Claw Machines) were initially really fun
8. TONS of smoking
9. No fruit, obviously some strawberries, but really very little fruit compared to what we are used to eating
10. SWEETS everywhere--getting a hearty breakfast is impossible.
11. Language was never a problem. Easier in Korea than Japan. 

My whole family agrees that Seoul was our favorite city of the seven we visited and Busan was top three. We all enjoyed South Korea more than Japan and I did not expect that.",43,1743683712.0,koreatravel,22,0.88,False

Lightly touching this cable turned the screen back on.  This fixed the issue for a few days and then the screen gave out and the wire touching no longer fixed it.

We’re a high paced coffee shop in the city and these technical issues hurt our sales tremendously.

UA was not an option, Izuku buried his head in the pillows, he gave it a shot, hero, support, general, everything, but, no quirkless allowed, of course... He was told they would expand for quirkless people this year, but it seems it would be after the school year started, since the entrance exams rejected him outright.

Inko walked into her son's room as she laid a paper on his desk and a kiss at the back of his head. ""Chin up darling... It's not the end of the world. Trust your mom when she says she knows a good school you can try out!"" Izuku turned his head, seeing the seal of Shiketsu on the paper. He of course knew of Shiketsu, many consider it second best, but what separates it, is that it actually does allow quirkless people to join, the hero and support exams are already done, so he can't do that, but due to a leak in a building, the general exam was delayed, and izuku had a chance.

Izuku nervously entered the exam hall, even though many consider Shiketsu second best, there was no doubt the facilites were anything to scoff at, the exams were of course hard, but Izuku just did it and hoped for the best.

Days later, he got accepted, the apartment might as well have been flooded with all the tears, Inko couldn't be anything but happy, seeing his son don the black and gold.

The first day of Shiketsu was a simple orientation, and he was amazed, he constantly asked question after question, until the owl quirked teacher shyly asked him to stop, while some of the students shot him dirty looks. 

The first  week has been heaven, sure, not many friends, but hey no bullying! People don't really care about the quirkless kid, so he was just left alone! It wasn't until he was called to the principal's office that his heart sank.

He walked in,  the woman who sat in the grand office chair was a bit old, perhaps in her early or mid 50s, with short  and professional blue hair in a suit, she sat a little hunched as her short form leered over the desk at Izuku. Izuku stood firm as he bowed. 

""Principal Matsuda""

The principal nodded, ""Good to see that you are polite Midoriya, coffee?""

Izuku accepts as he sat down, a mug of coffee in his hands. ""Ma'am, may I ask what is wrong?""

Matsuda shook her head. ""No, dear, you haven't done anything wrong, tell me, do you know what happened at UA recently?""

Izuku's heart ached a little as he nodded. ""Yeah... They recently allowed quirkless people to join...."" He sighed as he looked off with a gaze to the sun.""

""And to my knowledge, you applied to UA before correct?"" 

Izuku nodded again. ""Yes ma'am, o-of course I chose Shiketsu in the end because it's bette-

""No, no, I'm not delusional dear, they didn't take any quirkless students and we did.""

Izuku's words got stuck in his mouth. before quietly whispering. ""I-I still think this place is better...""

Matsuda smiled. ""Glad you think that little one. I heard you wanted to be a hero correct?""

Izuku nodded. ""Yeah, underground, spotlight, I don't care, I had a dream but it's gone."" He bitterly laughed.

""What would you do to have a shot at being a hero?""

""Anything.""

""Even illegal things?""

""W-Well no!"" Izuku stammered. ""I won't kill-""

Matsuda chuckled. ""Of course not, I'm just playing Midoriya, but I want to offer you a spot in the hero course, as long if you accept what I need you to do.""

Izuku leaned in closer. ""What is it ma'am?""

""I need a spy.""

Matsuda explained. ""You know, the UA and Shiketsu rivalry right? Well, it gets really personal Midoriya. Do you know why?""

Izuku shook his head. ""No Ma'am.""

""UA and Shiketsu weren't always the titans of the education field you know? We were also once small and insignificant schools. But we both clawed our way up eventually, and I came into the position as principal same time as Nezu, and then, we received big news, there was a new plot of land, large, close to shops and public transport and prime for a school. There was a bid for it, but to my surprise, Nezu won the bid, even though we had roughly the same bid, the auction ruled it his. I thought it was just bad luck, but it wasn't until, that same auction and the company who managed it shut down and it's ceo was arrested for bribery, it was shocking news, so many politicians went down, but I went through the records, to see on the exact date, of the bid, UA had made a 50 million USD contribution to the company, securing the bid.""

Matsuda pulled out a piece of paper, and Izuku was familar with the scandal and his jaw dropped in bold red letters, UA, 50000000, and the company's name at the date of the bid.

""I confronted that rat, and he denied everything, while looking smug all the way, he knew damn well what he did and Shiketsu was forced to rot in that rural nowhere area, until we won a future bid, and now the only thing we can compete on is the image, and the quality, but since All Might is an alumni, and he just got hired, people only care about them. I want that to change, will you help me?""

Izuku scracthed his head, ""I'm not sure how I can?""

Matsuda pulled out a newspaper article. with ""UA STUDENT EXPELLED"" 

""The context behind that, after a bit of sleuthing in the HSPC, is a student, both because they deemed him ill equipped after an exam, and apparently, some sexual harrassment accusations, got kicked out, and someone from the general course got moved up, some kid with a mind quirk, I'm not sure, but, most importantly, there is a spot open for the general course, and I want you to apply for it.""

Izuku looked at her with a puzzled look. ""W-Wait, but I'm still a Shiketsu student?""

Matsuda nodded. ""That can be striked or hid from the record, you will still technically be one of us, but I need someone on the inside, and I think you are the best candidate.""

Izuku rubbed his forehead. ""I-I'm sorry but why me, and what you need me to do exactly? Am I going to die-""

""No, don't speak like that dear, no danger will come to you, but what I need you to do is help me with that damn collaboration program the HPSC is pushing. It contains stuff like joint training sessions. competitions yada yada, but this is the best opportunity, to show that Shiketsu can be better than UA, and I need intel, things on the student's quirks, what they're being taught, and what can we do to counteract that, the highlight of course being the sports festival, but this whole year will be important.""

Izuku nodded, becoming more interested, anything to be a hero.

""As for why I deem you to be suitable, is you are very good and very intelligent, your quirk studies homework speaks for itself, not many schools provide it, not even UA does it, and yet, you managed to figure out my quirk.""

""I have?""

""That homework with the theoretical woman with a blue pixel quirk? You thought it was a pocket dimension where I store items, and you were right! Not many people can claim that... I have full faith, that if you passed the entrance exam this well, you can ace UA's, not to mention, one other thing...""

Matsuda became a little awkward as she continued. ""You do know that just the beginning of last week, UA has announced it will take quirkless students going forward?""

""Well, A) It would look very good for PR,  B) No offense to you Midoriya... But you are a bit invisible...""

Izuku laughed, well aware of the scenario, the students didn't bully him, but they weren't pals with him either, one time, the class monitor was doing a roll call and he missed him, not to mention, all those years of fudging his grades, and being meek, trained him to be a bit invisible.

""You will be trained, for free, the same regiment the hero students go through, courtesy of  our hero course teachers, but you are needed to stay late at Shiketsu after going to UA, to catch up with our curriculum. It is going to be a lot of work, will you take it?""

Izuku looked at the ground, he would be lying if he said he didn't hold a grudge against UA, but to have a chance at being a hero, it would be worth it.

  
Scene 1.

Nariko one of the hero course  teachers looked at the small screen with the rest of the staff around the laptop.

""Alright Midoriya, I'm looking at your POV camera now, remember what Onimaru taught you ok.""

Izuku nodded. ""Yes sir, I'm approaching the storage right now."" Izuku slid on the gloves as he grabbed a lockpick from his pocket,  he picked open the storage room before hearing something from Nariko again. 

""Wait, someone else used the backdoor we made in the system...."" A loud  alarm pierced his ears, Izuku turned to the window to see the large gate disintegrated? He put his ear to the floor to hear loud running footsteps and yelling, he knows what happened, the alarm was supposed to be an intruder alarm, probably because of the reporters, no big deal.

""Remain calm Midoriya.""

Izuku slowly pushed open the door, just to see a man in a hoodie, with a short tuft of blue hair poking out, Izuku hid behind a shelf as he peered over at him, and realized that man was also printing out the exact things he needed, and downloading things into a USB, why? Not his business but still he has done him a favor, Izuku pulled out a metal pole from his shirt, and pressed a button as it extends into a metal bat with a taser on the end of it, he thrusts it into the man, tazing him, beofre bashing his head after. knocking him unconcious and taking the files and transfering the files to his USB stick and leave. Izuku quickly left after that, no one would suspect him given the stranger in the storage room.

At night, Izuku went back to Shiketsu, and entered the teacher's office, the staff look at him expectantly.

""Ok, quick housekeeping, I got bullied today."" The teachers were about to say something before Izuku held a finger up, and pulled out some paper. ""Some kids want me to do their homework for them, and... this is the work they've been doing, is it harder than Shiketsu?""

Taiki grabbed the paper and read it over. ""Yeah...Their questions are a little behind... Good to know...""

""We really need to get you therapy Midoriya..."" Ryujin said concerningly, Izuku shook his head. ""i know teacher, but, hey those years didn't go to waste at least, honed my ""acting"" skills."" Izuku tried to stay positive but teachers could tell the pain.

Matsuda stood up. ""Well, I'll get one of our robots to do the homework, what about the upcoming joint practice?""

Izuku slammed the paper down. ""We are doing it in the USJ.""

""The USJ?""

""Yeah, The Unforseen Simulation Joint. Basically a large facility that simulates natrual disasters, the whole training? Is just the hero students duking it out, one act as villains, one act as heroes there are hostages, simple.""

Matsuda slammed her table. ""RAT LIED TO ME!""

""It's bad principal, but this would make you feel better, I think he has told you that the competition would be randomly drawn,  in battles of 2v2, but he rigged it, the USB has a wheel app, that has predetermined odds! It determines what the teams are, where they fight, like in the earthquake section, or the landslide section or the fire section.""

The teachers all looked at the documents seething. ""Now, we do have one advantage, they don't know our quirks. But we know theirs.""

Izuku opened another file, pictures of students and their information, and quirks. ""It even has some of their weaknesses! Like, uh... Momo Yaoyorozu, weakness, indecisive, unconfident, with a creation quirk, just bombard her with stuff, overwhelm her and that would be enough I believe.""

Nariko and Ryujin nodded. ""Hm... I think that-"" Matsuda raised her hand, ""Wait, let him talk. You have a gameplan right Midoriya?""

""Yes ma'am, now in case of group A, I think we struck gold, with Miyamoto, in the earthquake section, he has an earthbending quirk, so that's simple, use him to stablizie the ground, then, Haru, with literal cannons on her arms, will act as the main offensive weapon, against Yaoyorozu, keep the pressure on and she can crack, and her team mate? Bakugo? Look, uncooperative, and selfish, he is a hot head, I think Miyamoto using his ""Earth's Embrace"" trap move, would be the go to move, and bait Bakugo into the trap.""

Matsuda looked to the teachers nodded like a proud mother. ""Continue Midoriya. You have the floor for the night.""

""Thank you Ma'am, now, the USB does have some tape of the students, let's watch."" For the first time in his life, he felt useful, appreciated.

Nariko leaned his head to Ryujin, ""I see an underground hero in him...""

""Hey he could go limelight, you never know!""

Scene 2:

Nezu's fist cracked the tea cup in his hand as he threw it across the room as the last group of UA students walk out in shame. ""3-17!!! HOW ON EARTH DID CLASS 1A GO 2-8!  CLASS 1B WENT 1-9!  AND ALL THOSE 3 WINS CAME FROM THEM COMPLETING SAVING OR PROTECTING THE HOSTAGES! NOT IN COMBAT! HOW DID WE FUMBLE!""

Eraserhead and Vlad King looked to the ground. ""Sorry sir, we will do better next time."" The two teachers were shivering at this point, he expected some losses, but 3-17 was a bit much.

""NOT TO MENTION, THEY LOOKED PREPARED! THEY PREDICTED EVERY MOVE THE STUDENTS MADE! HOW!""

Nezu turned around to see the teachers have already escaped,

""COWARDS!""

Scene 3:

""A damn prodigy...."" Matsuda muttered as he looked at the masterpiece in front of her, a tape of Izuku training how to fight under Nariko and Ryujin, him kicking sandbags, karate chopping wood and doing yoga. Before Izuku burst in.

""PRINCIPAL MATSUDA!"" Izuku yelled as he rushed in.

""Yes my dear! What's wrong!"" Izuku huffed as he sat down on the chair, ""I found out what the new joint sports festival competitions would be.""

Matsuda looked through the files, nodded. ""Good we will adjust the regiment to make our students better at these things-""

""No, there's something more important."" Izuku continued as he pulled some photos out,""So you know me, quiet, insignificant, and I found this.""

Izuku pressed his phone. A recording, of Endeavour berating his son, Matsuda looked at it like he just found  the fountain of youth. 

""An alumni of UA being an abuser and being part of a quirk marriage!"" Matsuda lied back in her chair.

""Principal?""

""J-Just let me thank you, and God for this opportunity...""",15,1743683453.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,3,0.94,False

I have the morning and part of the afternoon off. I’ve been a bit lonely these days and just want some company today. I’m hoping to find a female around my age who may be feeling the same. 

I’d love to go out for coffee, we can even get breakfast if you’d like. We can talk, judgment free about anything! Or we can sit in some sort of silence without feeling awkward or pressured to talk at all. Seriously. This next part is important. If you can host, (which i know is a lot to ask for, but unfortunately I cannot because of my room mate situation) I’d love to go back to your place and cuddle…. We can even skip coffee and breakfast all together and just go straight to cuddling. Whether it’s on the couch or in bed I just want that bit of intimacy and feeling of being safe i guess. We can go as far as kissing if you’d like to, but I’m not really looking for anything beyond that. I just want share a comfortable and close moment with a stranger in hopes of feeling a bit better and hopefully making you feel the same too:) I apologize if i’ve sounded so pathetic. 
If you’re the rare person that might need this today too, i hope to hear from you:) I posted the locations i’m willing to travel to but if you’re farther, we can talk and see if it works depending on how far. besides that We can talk more details then too.

like every dream, like every day.  
I sip my coffee, dark and deep,  
and ponder life—what do we keep?

A cog within the grand machine,  
replaceable, unseen.  
No mark remains when I am gone,  
just whispers lost in time’s cold dawn.

Perhaps my children, strong and bright,  
will carry forth my flickering light.  
Yet they, too, will fade to dust,  
like all before, like all of us.

Then grandchildren—yes, build for them!  
Shape their world, light their flame.  
But time’s cruel hands will claim them too,  
as history swallows all we do.

The weight is heavy, thoughts unkind,  
a futile chase, a weary mind.  
Yet in my hands, this warmth I feel—  
a cup of coffee, rich and real.

The future’s mist, the past is set,  
but in this moment, I forget.  
No need to chase eternity,  
but live this breath, and let it be.

Not for a legacy, not for a name,  
not for a world that forgets the same—  
but for the joy within this cup,  
for now, for me, and that’s enough.
