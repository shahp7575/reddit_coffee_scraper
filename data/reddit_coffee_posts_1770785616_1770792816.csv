1r1q80y,https://www.reddit.com/r/WEEDS/comments/1r1q80y/do_you_hear_and_see/,Do you Hear and See?,"Do you Blepete? I apologize I am barely learning Greek as a long 12 yr accountant! But do you see or hear spiritually? When I was doing some reading recently, I had what I believe a personal Revelation with the Lord. I have several of these over the past several years as I’ve worked to blot out the noise of life and seek the Lord. As an executive in the professional world, I’m often using leadership techniques in listening to people and seeing visual facts to ascertain with a high degree of confidence the skill to manage and manage well. I’ve seen myself somewhat as a visionary in this aspect as if often seek past the day to day issues, to plan and make sure we are on track from a strategy standpoint, which I really enjoy. I’m seasoned in the hard work thru businesses and am constantly using my listening skills. Do they know their task? Are they performing something and only doing a task cause they got trained? Or do they critically think thru the roll and have deep understanding on issues, or how their task are impacting others around them. So, it’s important to lead with care but also know who’s capable of what, and in today’s crazy HR environment it’smore important than ever to listen.

In the same way I think I’ve begun to learn to listen for the Lord. A few years back I began removing the constant “noise” in my life how we constantly go from news cycle to news cycle, sports season to season, to different trends, social media, and dooms scrolling, leading, personal work life and climbing the America corporate ladder, and asking myself how can I ever hear from the Lord if I never listen for him. I can barely process what the daily life is throwing at me 85-100 emails a day on work, waking daily to urgent international needs, and trying to lead a large young family, and trying to keep up with everything! It was too much! But I just kept asking the Lord, how can we even hear you w all this going on? Is this the cycle of meaning?  In late 2023 I was listening to Make Space by Bethel and began to ponder what does it mean to make space for the Lord? And began a journey of seeking after the Lord with pure joy to mentally remove the things that were distracting my heart from truly seeing His beauty and grace and Mercy and most of all Love. It was a deep period of living through my weaknesses of substance use, laziness at times, feeling overwhelmed, under satisfied not meeting goals, anxiousness, times of lust, anger. But it was a year in 2024 I set it as my goal to seek the Holy Spirit and learn to hear his voice.

I began the year with a month long fast from substance abuse (weed and alcohol), just to really understand my mental capacity, as I actually believe in moderation of daily substance use, can be beneficial in as Paul stated we all things are lawful to us. I was meditating thru John 15 and what it truly means to be connected to the vine. I began to seek after some pastors preaching on the Holy Spirit, as while I love the church I currently serve for providing stability in our families faith while I live a bit of an adventurous life. But, it’s the same constant preaching and I ask questions important to me and since I’m open about my use, there is not respect.

However, as I truly began meditating and that month the Lord woke me up at 430am daily and took me back to a time in life where I had some of those daily habits and was teaching me that through grace and discipline in those periods to listen for him. During that time I wrestled about my idols of sports, work, substance use , and began to gain more confidence in seeking after Him and listening to what others say who are seeking the Spirit are honestly crying out with so much unity! There is a wave of refreshing spirit filled music that is truly focused on being in the presence of the Lord and as Stephen proclaims don’t  you see him standing there in heaven! That year I wrestled with what does it mean to really step out on the water and radically seek after the Lord thru work trials, busyness, but hold constant to Jesus thru fears of losing my job, spouse, home, and more it brought beautiful moments of meditation in seeking after Jesus in the midst of the storm. if you watch the chosen at one point you see Peter get out of the boat and firmly walks towards Jesus. He begins to sink looking at the storms and waves ( anemon/ wind of the 4 corners, maybe he was even aware of some of the depths of the ancients of deep!!!) but it’s a beautiful image of him holding on to Jesus, our one and mighty-full savior!

-2026. This might be edited to allow more thought if discussion continues (as a Christian who uses substances as a tool, but open to periods of prolonged fasting for further personal and spiritual evaluation). Many more moments of personal reflection while using and while fasting.. I got a brief period in between jobs to fast again, and see if there would be any opportunities to go on my own, but I clearly still had learning to do!

But ended the year feeling a bit failed and off course when I started a new executive roll at a company that needed lots of mental attention. While  trying to coach people up to speed in modernize 20 yr old business practices. Back to long nights, emails at 2am, coffee, and staying alert on companies failing to notice industry trends. I felt I overcame a lot of fear and became even more focused on seeking the Lord . And as further time came in 2025 I noticed 2024 for me was a year of learning to give up the personal things of my heart. I started the year very close to the Lord, and meditation on being connected to the vine and living water, while also going thru prolonged periods of frustration of not being around people who can see the filth we engage in on a daily basis. I went into 2025 and got rid of all social media as a personal offering to the Lord in recognition of so much time wasted and even further began meditating on passages. I’ll go into personal reflections on this later. But really began to grow in trusting in the promises of the Lord  so much deeper and his Presence and some of the powers of the spirit revealed! It’s funny, we sing we want a fresh wind of the Holy Spirit, but so many forget how far they are for the fears and doubts every day life brings. The faith is hard, and the systems we live in seem endless. But the spirit is coming and is very powerful! And we all have constantly hurt the Spirit, in our daily lives and the things we let in. But the goal is to get close to Jesus. If you want to follow Him and continue to learn we really need the basics of full surrender. There are so many songs out there preparing hearts even in the mainstream with the King of hearts tours and many song centered around our posture of everything at the feet of Jesus and laying our burdens on Him and recognizing his presence and peace throughout our daily lives. Across the nations are suffering but the wave of the Spirit is close and we need our hearts fully surrender to the King of Hearts our Lord and Savior, the great high Priest. Jesus Christ. Amen.

Learning to battle through prayer, meditations worshipping and teaching in the spirit, I have begun to properly view him in the room! Our great high priest has an offering of love, peace, wisdom, mercy, and the depths of knowledge. I do not fear where He is leading because the Spirit is leading and senses His closeness. But that means holding loosely the things I have. There was another vision I had in on bringing your offerings before the Lord. Imagine at the day of repentance. Are you prepared to present your families as the tribes of Isreal did in the book of Joshua? I don’t believe I am. 3 of my 4 children are saved but one is still young and developing his pre-teen thoughts! But on a more sense of where our hearts are at, we will bring idols. His message is burning in my heart for our hearts to be fully His is ever more as they face the impurities we faced as a generation. We have been a wicked generation, born from a corrupt generation, but there is still time for repentance. There is opportunity for all to open up to Jesus and seek His presence now! Listening to obsessions by Mercy culture right now. I don’t have full wisdom on everything and I am not perfect but I write w the integrity of a trusted finance executive w a heart for building up others and seeking the spirit. But there is significant evil amidst us and the Lord is near.

Listen to House of Prayer by Mitch Wong. But the goal was to write about Blepete. I was reading Matthew 24, and Matthew writes Take Heed. It is cool how in the Greek you can take notice of words and as new testament Christian’s we should be able to memorize patterns in words used. But luckily we have great apps like Biblehub where you can read the Greek next to the original, and go deeper looking at the meaning of the words and then their corresponding where used! It was very interesting to see that word was often used thought the gospels in Matt 13 & and mark 8 where he warned them in the same fashion when they were just complaining about bread. Just ponder on Jesus! There’s so much more to come! The rest is here, His Presence is coming and come to worship. Listening to here I am now. But think about that! He used that same warning to warn us on the bread as he warned of the signs to come. It’s time to center on him let your worship be a shield and warrior over your home and begin to love on Jesus and the Holy Spirit, it is time to invite Him into your homes and let him cure you from the inside out. There are seasons of pruning and gathering and we’re calling those in! Doesn’t matter who you are what you done! His gates are open and His Spirit has full power of you to change your entire life for His Good. Jew, American Christian, Mormon, catholic , non believer,  Islam, there is room the king of the universe. I pray I might visit some of my friends in Isreal! Stay safe!

1r1q7lg,https://www.reddit.com/r/cycling/comments/1r1q7lg/cycling_and_a_smart_trainer_training_and_getting/,Cycling and a smart trainer : training and getting back in shape after years away,"Hello everyone,

Sorry for the long message,  I’m not entirely sure where I want to go with this post, but I felt like sharing something about my favorite sport, my return to road cycling after several years away, and the start of a weight loss and getting back in shape journey. If you find this too long there is a TL;DR at the end ! 

Last weekend, my girlfriend really wanted us to go on a coffee date to work on our 2026 mood boards (yeah, a bit cheesy, I know). On my side of the table, I was looking at smart trainers, and that’s what eventually pushed me to make the purchase. I spent some time shopping around before choosing one. A few years ago, from what I remember, there weren’t nearly as many options. I’m honestly really happy and excited about it. I managed to find a 20% coupon through a company in my city, which made the decision even easier. I ended up going with a JetBlack Victory with a Zwift Cog. (Saved 200$ off the trainer and the smart block)

I discovered road cycling about a decade ago, when I was a young adult. Back then, I wasn’t really athletic, but I was in shape, early twenties, young and awkwardly slim, somewhat like a meerkat. I immediately fell in love with it. At first, I rode slowly and distances felt hard, but over time I learned how to push myself, listen to my body, manage my energy, and fuel properly for rides. I loved the calm of looking straight ahead, thinking about nothing, climbing and descending hills, and slowly increasing distance. Cycling also gave me something concrete to see, my legs getting stronger, my muscles developing, my body slowly changing. At my peak, the longest ride I ever did in a single day was 180 km.

Then one day, my bike got stolen. I was lucky enough to find it online, but parts were missing and it never really felt the same. After that, every time I tried to get back into cycling, something got in the way. During theatre school and throughout the pandemic, a series of harder life events piled up, including grief, depression, and anxiety. When I finished school, I slowly stopped moving as much and became more sedentary.

I haven’t been as active for years now. I tried going to the gym, but it only lasted about three months. I found it draining and the environment just wasn’t for me. Two years ago, I even bought a road bike to motivate myself to start again, but it was hard to face how much I couldn’t perform like I used to. These days, I get out of breath more easily, have less energy, and I’m less flexible. Over the holidays, I weighed myself and realized I was about 25 pounds away from being too heavy for my bike.

After realizing how far I’d drifted from where I used to be, I really want to get back into it for good, before it’s too late. I’m genuinely excited. I bought a smart trainer last week. And just to be clear, I’m doing okay. This feels more like a healthy reset than anything else.

I’m not expecting to lose 50-60 pounds overnight, but I think this is the best gift I could have given myself this year. I’ll be able to train from the comfort of my home, go on zwift, slowly prepare for my first real cycling season in years, use my bike more for commuting, and relearn how to ride longer distances. I know this will have a positive impact on my mood, my energy, and my overall health.

If any of you feel like sharing your experiences training on a smart trainer, thoughts on weight loss, getting back into shape, or stories from people who’ve been through something similar, I’d really love to read you. It would honestly just make me even more excited to get back on the bike.

And over the next few months, I’d be happy to share how things are going.

Take care ! 

TL;DR :

Getting back into road cycling after several years away. Life, mental health, and the pandemic got in the way, I became more sedentary, gained weight, and drifted from the sport I loved. I just bought a smart trainer as a way to reset, get back in shape, and slowly return to cycling.

1r1q5xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/parkingguides/comments/1r1q5xi/parking_tips_for_wmot_finally_friday_at_3rd_and/,Parking tips for WMOT Finally Friday at 3rd and Lindsley (Nashville 02/13),"  
hey everyone, heading to see the garrett boys, garrett hendricks, and lauren lucas for the wmot finally friday show on 02/13? figured i would share some parking info since that area of nashville gets pretty wild around noon on a friday.  
  
check out Prked first if you want to skip the stress of circling the block. you can basically rent someones driveway or a private garage spot right next to 3rd and lindsley through the app. it is way cheaper than the official paid lots and you can skip the traffic mess since you are just a short walk away.  
  
the venue actually has its own parking lot right in front and to the side, but honestly it is way too small for the crowd that usually shows up for these lunch sets. if you are not there at least 45 minutes early on 02/13 you probably will not get a spot in that main lot. street parking is an option along lindsley ave and 3rd ave south, but you really have to watch the signs because nashville parking enforcement is super aggressive about meters and tow zones near the neighboring shops. there are some paid surface lots further down on 4th ave south and near the city winery area but they can be a bit of a hike and get pricey for just an hour or two. there is also a gravel lot directly across from the venue that sometimes allows paid parking, but it fills up just as fast as the main lot.  
  
traffic around 3rd and lindsley gets really congested around noon because of the local lunch rush mixed with commuters heading downtown. if the main lot is full when you arrive, avoid the temptation to park at the goodyear tire shop or the rolling mill hill apartment complexes because they are known for towing people almost immediately. also be careful with the area near crema coffee because they keep those spots strictly for their own customers and will check. your best strategy for the 02/13 show is to either get there way before noon to snag a spot at the venue or just use Prked so you have a guaranteed space waiting for you nearby without the headache. hope this helps and you guys have a blast at the show.",1,1770792210.0,parkingguides,0,1.0,False
1r1q1pn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1r1q1pn/claude_deep_research_give_me_empty_research_report/,Claude Deep Research give me empty Research Report,"I use Opus 4.6 to create a comprehensive research prompt below

    # Module 1 — Section A: Survey of Classification Systems & Unified Taxonomy Framework
    
    ## Execution Instructions
    
    - **Model**: Claude (claude-opus-4-6) or ChatGPT Deep Research
    - **Token budget**: This section targets ~60k output tokens. Stop and summarize if approaching limits.
    - **Primary lens**: Tea (all six types + puer). Reference wine, coffee, perfumery as secondary comparisons.
    - **Cultural focus**: Chinese, Japanese, and broader Asian sensory vocabulary first; Western systems as cross-reference.
    - **Depth**: Breadth-first — establish the full landscape before going deep. This section builds the scaffolding for Sections B and C.
    - **Citations**: Lightweight — reference by system name and creator (e.g., ""Noble's Wine Aroma Wheel, 1984""). No full bibliographic entries needed.
    - **Chemical data**: Optional. Include compound names where they clarify a point; skip IUPAC, thresholds, and volatility data (covered in Section B).
    
    ---
    
    ## Objective
    
    Survey all major existing flavor and aroma classification systems, compare them, identify gaps, and propose a unified 3-level taxonomy (Family → Sub-family → Descriptor) that works across food, beverage, and fragrance — with tea as the primary organizing context.
    
    **Guiding principle**: A Chinese tea master, a Japanese sommelier, a Thai chef, and a perfumer should all find their descriptors represented in this taxonomy.
    
    ---
    
    ## Part 1: Survey of Existing Classification Systems
    
    ### 1.1 Systems to Survey
    
    For each system, document in a table:
    
    | Field | What to capture |
    |-------|----------------|
    | System name | Full name |
    | Creator / Org | Who made it, when |
    | Domain | What it was designed for |
    | Structure | Levels of hierarchy, number of categories at each level |
    | Strengths | What it covers well |
    | Gaps | What it misses — especially tea-relevant aromas |
    | Adoption | How widely used in its field |
    
    **Systems (10 total):**
    
    1. **Wine Aroma Wheel** — Ann C. Noble, UC Davis, 1984
    2. **SCA Coffee Taster's Flavor Wheel** — SCA & WCR, 2016 revision
    3. **Beer Flavor Wheel** — Meilgaard et al., 1979
    4. **Tea Flavor Wheels** — Survey the most-used ones (Chinese tea research, Taiwanese oolong descriptors, Japanese green tea vocabulary). Identify which are most adopted.
    5. **Fragrance Wheel** — Michael Edwards
    6. **Sensory Spectrum / Descriptive Analysis** — Gail Civille, Spectrum method
    7. **Foodpairing Aroma Profiles** — Bernard Lahousse / Foodpairing
    8. **Flavornet Database** — Terry Acree, Cornell
    9. **LRI & Odour Databases** — GC-MS odour databases
    10. **The Good Scents Company** — Online chemistry/perfumery reference
    
    ### 1.2 Asian Sensory Vocabularies
    
    This subsection has no equivalent in Western surveys and is critical for this project.
    
    **Research and document:**
    
    | Language/Tradition | What to capture |
    |-------------------|----------------|
    | **Chinese tea vocabulary (茶香)** | Standard aroma categories used in Chinese tea evaluation (审评). Include terms like 清香, 花香, 果香, 蜜香, 陈香, 火香, etc. How are these organized? Are there official standards (GB/T)? |
    | **Japanese tea vocabulary** | Descriptors for sencha, gyokuro, matcha, hojicha. Terms like 旨味 (umami), 渋味 (astringency), 青臭い (grassy), 火香 (roasted). How does Japanese tea evaluation structure differ from Chinese? |
    | **Japanese sake vocabulary** | Flavor wheels or structured vocabularies for sake — relevant because of overlap with fermentation and umami descriptors |
    | **Korean tea and fermented food vocabulary** | Any structured sensory vocabularies for Korean teas or fermented foods (kimchi, doenjang, gochujang) |
    | **Southeast Asian aromatic vocabulary** | Thai, Vietnamese, Indonesian terms for aromatics — lemongrass, galangal, pandan, etc. How are these categorized locally vs in Western systems? |
    
    **Key question**: Where do Asian sensory vocabularies have categories that don't map cleanly onto Western flavor wheels? Document these gaps explicitly — they represent descriptors our unified taxonomy must include.
    
    ### 1.3 Cross-System Comparison
    
    Answer these questions with evidence from the survey:
    
    1. **Universal categories**: Which aroma families appear in every system regardless of domain? List them.
    2. **Domain-specific categories**: Which descriptors only appear in one domain? (e.g., ""barnyard"" in wine, ""陈香/aged aroma"" in puer tea)
    3. **Terminology conflicts**: Same word, different meaning across systems. Document at least 10 examples. (e.g., ""fruity"" in wine vs coffee vs tea)
    4. **Asian-Western gaps**: Descriptors common in Asian evaluation that have no Western equivalent, and vice versa.
    5. **Structural differences**: Do Asian systems organize aromas differently than Western hierarchical wheels? (e.g., by processing method rather than by sensory category?)
    6. **Perception vs chemistry**: Does any system organize by chemical class rather than perceived similarity? What are the tradeoffs?
    7. **Unified attempts**: Has anyone proposed a cross-domain unified taxonomy before? Survey any existing attempts (academic or commercial).
    
    ### 1.4 Cognitive Science of Aroma Categorization
    
    Brief survey (1-2 pages equivalent):
    
    - How do humans naturally group aromas? By similarity? By source? By hedonic value?
    - Does language shape aroma categorization? (Relevant: Jahai and Maniq peoples have much richer aroma vocabularies than English speakers — research this)
    - Expert vs novice categorization differences
    - Implications for taxonomy design: should we follow perceptual clusters or chemical logic?
    
    ---
    
    ## Part 2: Proposed Unified Taxonomy
    
    ### 2.1 Design Principles
    
    The taxonomy must satisfy these constraints:
    
    1. **3 levels**: Family → Sub-family → Specific Descriptor
    2. **Tea-first**: Every family must include tea-relevant descriptors and examples
    3. **Cross-domain**: Works for food, beverage, and fragrance
    4. **Bilingual anchors**: Key terms provided in English + Chinese (+ Japanese where distinct)
    5. **Perception-based**: Organized by how things smell/taste, not by chemistry
    6. **Extensible**: New descriptors can be added without restructuring
    
    ### 2.2 The 17 Aroma Families — Overview Table
    
    Present the complete taxonomy as a single reference table. For each family:

    |-------|---------|
    | Family name | English |
    | Chinese term | Simplified Chinese equivalent |
    | Japanese term | Where distinct from Chinese |
    | Number of sub-families | Count |
    | Sub-family names | Listed |
    | Tea relevance | Which tea types most commonly exhibit this family (e.g., ""Floral → high-oxidation oolong, jasmine-scented"") |
    | Cross-domain note | Where this family also appears (wine, coffee, perfumery, cuisine) |
    
    **The 17 Families:**
    
    1. Fruity (果香)
    2. Floral (花香)
    3. Herbal (草本香)
    4. Spice (香料香)
    5. Roasted/Toasted (烘焙香/焦香)
    6. Nutty (坚果香)
    7. Earthy (土壤香/陈香)
    8. Woody (木质香)
    9. Green/Vegetal (青草香/植物香)
    10. Marine/Oceanic (海洋香)
    11. Dairy (乳香)
    12. Sweet Aroma (甜香)
    13. Savory/Umami (鲜味香)
    14. Sulfurous (硫化物香)
    15. Chemical/Off-notes (化学异味)
    16. Fermented (发酵香)
    17. Animal (动物香)
    
    ### 2.3 Sub-family Listing
    
    For each of the 17 families, list all sub-families with:
    
    - Sub-family name (English + Chinese/Japanese)
    - 3-5 example descriptors
    - Primary tea type association (if any)
    - 1-2 key compounds (name only, no detailed data — that's Section B)
    
    **Format as a nested list or indented table. Keep it scannable.**
    
    ### 2.4 Taxonomy Boundary Decisions
    
    Document and justify decisions about ambiguous cases:
    
    - Where does ""herbal"" end and ""green/vegetal"" begin?
    - Is ""smoky"" under Roasted or a separate family?
    - Does ""mineral"" belong under Earthy or is it a mouthfeel, not an aroma?
    - Where do fermentation aromas overlap with earthy, animal, and chemical?
    - How to handle aromas that shift families at different concentrations (e.g., indole: floral at low, fecal at high)?
    
    ### 2.5 Tea Processing → Aroma Family Map
    
    Unique to this taxonomy — map tea processing steps to aroma families they generate:
    
    | Processing Step | Aroma Families Activated | Key Transformations |
    |----------------|------------------------|-------------------|
    | Withering (萎凋) | Floral, fruity | Enzymatic oxidation begins, C6 aldehydes → alcohols |
    | Kill-green (杀青) | Green/vegetal, roasted | Enzyme deactivation, Maillard initiation |
    | Rolling (揉捻) | Green, herbal | Cell rupture, juice release |
    | Oxidation (氧化) | Floral, fruity, sweet | Catechin → theaflavin → thearubigin |
    | Roasting (烘焙) | Roasted, nutty, sweet, caramel | Maillard reaction, caramelization |
    | Pile fermentation (渥堆) | Earthy, fermented, animal | Microbial metabolism |
    | Aging (陈化) | Woody, earthy, animal, sweet | Slow oxidation, microbial action |
    | Scenting (窨制) | Floral (jasmine, osmanthus, etc.) | Volatile absorption |

1r1q1bn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinkingfitness/comments/1r1q1bn/day_2_update/,day 2 update,"Hopefully it is ok to keep posting my updates here but if not I can move to another place too or come back after it has been a while. Maybe my next update will be after a week instead so I don’t clog this…I guess, in some way, this is almost a motivation in itself to share and also digest via my own written words how my body is changing from being a daily wine bottle a day drinker to now taking back control. 

I know it is only 2 days under my belt but I am so committed now and it is almost a thrill to understand and process my body changing for the better. 

Last night after day 1, I slept through the night and woke up fresh. The morning was fine and got through lunch (2 egg healthy omelette with one tortilla) which is where in the past I would start to deviate with some mental excuse that europeans drank with lunch so I could too. Instead, I took time making a slow pour over coffee after my meal (my 2nd cup of the day which I never do). I savored that taste and it got me through. 

By evening, my cravings were there and actually stronger than yesterday but that’s all I let them be and was resilient. 

Ate a slightly less healthy meal of fried rice and tom yum soup but hit a total of 1500 calories for the day. My treat instead of my normal glass…glasses of wine was frozen blueberries which I shared with my toddler. 

I know this is fitness group but just another thing I appreciated from today was - in past, I always had a glass of red wine in my hand when my toddler came to me in evenings. I work a stressful job and it was my reward after brutal day of meetings. Today, I didn’t have any worry a wine glass was going to get knocked over and instead, I just had my toddler running around and we played and read all night and it was amazing. I am there for him already but this just felt different without wine being knocked over as the worry. 

Mentally, I feel incredible and strong and confident. I am ready for tomorrow and thrilled with this focus to regain myself and my mind and body. Surprisingly no headaches or anything bad yet. My body is still bloated but hoping with also eating healthier, it will start to materialize in better way by next week. 

I didn’t get in as much fitness today as it was cold and stormy and nanny cancelled but that is next. I am most focused on regaining my flexibility first, mental resilience, and then move towards finding time to get in the next level of physical discipline. I have never meditated or anything in the past but somehow this feels the closest to doing something like that. Like I am teaching into a part of myself that I had muted and dulled. 

Only day 2 but progressing. 

My goal weight is to get back to 130 from 147. Hoping even the initial water bloat will help either puffiness and looks even as it takes longer to get the pounds off. 

Anyways, if you read all this thank you. I so appreciate this supportive and encouraging community and the motivation seeing others succeed. ",5,1770791753.0,stopdrinkingfitness,2,0.86,False

 61 days without cannabis edibles and ciggerates and other substances. 
I was using very low doses of alprazolam in between.

Then the relapse happened. And honestly I couldn't enjoy cannabis edibles and ciggerate .


Second time 
31 days without smoking cigarettes but still was using cannabis edibles in between.

Then the relapse happened and again couldn't enjoy this substance abuse or the relief that this substances gave to me.

Third time 
It's the present scenario.
12 days sober , no ciggerate and cannabis or alprazolam or pregablin just managing with  Tea , coffee and L theanine.

I don't quite know the right questions to ask...

But, what should be my total roast time?

I'm thinking a little over 3 minutes in drying... is this correct?

What are minimum and max times in maillard?

In development, I'm not trying to do anything fancy, just a well balanced medium roast. If I can do that, then I do have some beans for a light roast, as so many like. So... I'm just watching the beans, and dropping when it feels right. Something like under 2 minutes, maybe 1:40.

Thanks for any comments.

don't want that at all we want to make

7:02

sure that we get enough time within the

7:04

brown phase to be able to allow these

7:07

reactions to take place and then the

7:09

caramelization

7:11

is going to be taking place then and

7:13

through development we don't want to

7:15

rush it but we don't want to extend it

7:17

we don't want to extend the browning

7:18

phase too long either because then we

7:21

start to mute these reactions and also

7:23

the carmelization if we

7:26

go too long in development then we get

7:29

past the point of maximum sweetness and

7:31

we start to mute or that sweetness that

7:35

caramelization that's taken place

7:38

starts to go in towards bitter notes and

7:40

so we don't want to do that either so

7:42

the length of time that we spend in

7:44

these two phases is really important and

7:47

is going to have great impact on the end

7:49

cup and the sweetness in the cup

7:52

this is a really important point because

7:55

that's why understanding the three

7:57

phases of roasting coffee is so

7:59

important because we have this total

8:00

roast time that we're dealing with let's

8:02

just say you're on an air roaster and

8:04

your total roast time is seven minutes

8:07

you're going to want to have

8:09

a certain amount of that percentage of

8:11

that time be devoted towards the

8:14

browning phase and then first crack hits

8:16

and then a certain amount of time that's

8:18

going to be devoted towards the

8:20

development phase before you drop the

8:22

coffee so understanding the timing of

8:25

all that is really going to be helpful

8:27

and you'll be surprised if you start to

8:30

move some of those times around how much

8:33

time you're spending in those phases

8:36

you'll find that you can have the same

8:38

coffee with a different result based on

8:41

how much time

8:42

you're devoting towards each of those

8:45

phases it's really interesting and again

8:47

rob huss's book that's what he

8:49

experiments with he goes through and he

8:51

makes subtle changes in temperature over

8:54

time

8:55

and it does impact the flavor notes of

8:58

the coffee where you'll have something

9:00

that might taste like a real bright

9:02

tangerine

9:04

but then with a couple of changes a

9:06

little more time extended in the middle

9:08

phase all of a sudden you start to get

9:10

these darker notes like a bergamot type

9:12

of an orange

9:13

that will

9:15

it's all in the same coffee with just

9:17

because you've extended the time of the

9:20

middle face

9:21

by 30 seconds or 15 seconds it can have

9:24

a great impact

9:26

it's also going to help us with

9:27

consistency too once we start to figure

9:29

out our times and our temperatures and

9:31

how to apply that towards these

# Tucup Shakur

Raised on the wrong side of the cupboard, Tucup Shakur, ( 2CP as he likes to be called ) is a teacup gone bad. Once a lovely vessel for fine, hot beverages now he's resorted to a life of crime and debauchery.

Born in the forgotten back shelf of Granny's China Cabinet, Tucup never knew the soft life of Sunday tea service. While the fine china sipped Earl Grey with the upper crust, Tucup and his crew got the dregs - stale Lipton bags and lukewarm tap water.

The day Granny's grandson used him as a ashtray was the day something cracked inside him. Not just his rim - his whole worldview shattered.

He rolled deep with the Ceramic Cartel, moving hot leaf through the underground cupboard network. Oolong, Darjeeling, that premium Pu-erh - if it steeped, Tucup could flip it.

He's got beef with the Coffee Cups (bougie espresso types), respect from the Mugs (working class, real ones), and the Saucers still owe him from that job in '09. That gold chain? Melted down from Granny's antique spoon collection.

The grill? Sterling silver tea strainer, custom fitted. ""2CP"" tattooed on his handle stands for ""Two Cups or Die"" - his crew's motto. They ride or dry together.a

SONG LYRICS

\[INTRO\] Yeah… back shelf bastard… forgotten china… They threw me Lipton dregs while the bougie cups got Earl Grey… I cracked… but I came back meaner. Ceramic Cartel, Cuppa!. 2CP or die. Let’s pour up.

\[VERSE 1\] Born dusty, back corner, cabinet felon (uh) Granny china princess, I’m the porcelain felon (facts) Never seen sugar cubes, just stale bag remnants (nah) While fine bone sipped proper, I got the punishment (damn) Grandson flicked ash in me, thought I’d fold quick (what?) Cracked my lip bloody, but that made a cold bitch (ice) Now I’m trappin’ heavy leaf, Oolong in the vacuum packs (brr) Fat bricks of Pu-erh, got the whole shelf taxed (taxed!) Gold links drippin’, melted Granny’s heirloom spoon (bling) Turned her tea-time treasure to my neck cartoon (ha) Silver needle grill, shinin’ when I speak (glist) Coffee mugs mad as fuck, but they too weak (pussies)

\[CHORUS\] 2CP, that’s the only set I bang (gang gang) Two Cups or Die tatted on the handle, no slang (tatted up) Steeped in pain, porcelain still holdin’ flame (flame) From back-shelf gutter to runnin’ this whole game (boss) 2CP, scream it when the cupboard shake (2CP!) Two Cups or Die, we don’t negotiate (never) Porcelain scars, but the hustle don’t break (never) Cup life forever, Cuppa — we don’t fade

\[VERSE 2\] Saucers still duckin’ me from that ’09 lick (pay up) Teabags on the tile, chalk outline shit (bodies) Every chip a battle scar, every crack a stripe (tats) Tossed in the trash, climbed out the same night (rose) Espresso clowns flexin’ with they little double shots (fake) We pour triple steeped, leave your whole block hot (leanin’) Silver Needle hittin’, got me sippin’ slow-mo (lean) Head rush from the head stash, now I’m movin’ like woah (woah) Mugs show love, them real workin’ class soldiers (solid) We was flippin’ Darjeeling while y’all was posin’ (ha) Granny forgot my name, I’m a ghost in her will (gone) But I built a tea empire off the shit that she spilled (built it)

\[BRIDGE – slow, 2cp melancholy, steam rising\] They see the chains now and ask how I survived… A teacup full of rage with nowhere to hide… Every scald was torture, every pour was a fight… Turned broken china into gangsta life tonight…

\[VERSE 3 – hard, aggressive, gun-cocking energy\] Talk on the Cartel? Get your rim split (crack!) Steam comin’ off the block, that’s the clip (brrt) Used bags on the floor where the casualties sit (R.I.P.) Pu-erh bricks so heavy, need a forklift (heavy) Still rock the same chips, still the same cup (same) Just added more ice, still don’t give a fuck (never) Graffiti on the cupboard door: “2CP own this” (facts) Ceramic Cartel worldwide — we don’t miss (gang) Leanin’ off that Silver Needle, double cup sippin’ (lean) Oolong in the Pyrex, watch the profit triple (whip it) They tried to rinse me out the game, leave me in suds (nah) Came back dirty, now the whole shelf in blood (splash)

I’ve just started week 3 of my new cal deficit and workout routine. cal deficit at 1200 or less is my goal. 

first week, lost 6lbs. amazing! was super happy. I knew after MANY failed weight loss attempts that I’d need to eventually change things up, but I didn’t expect the first month?? 

I do 5 days/week at the gym, cardio and abs 3 days, and lightweight workouts with cardio 2 days. 

I eat 2 meals a day plus protein shake. sometimes I have a snack (an apple with natural peanut butter or 70% dark chocolate, or an orange, I recently made 3 ingredient cookies that have only 20cal in them each so I’ll eat one when I have a sugar craving).

my first meal is almost always 1egg, and a little bit of egg whites, scrambled, sometimes I add cheese. Usually I have mustard on top (yes it’s weird, yes I love it, plus it’s 0 cal).

my second meal, I’m almost ALWAYS at the mercy of my bfs mother, who makes dinner. I’ve been able to modify them to the point I’m having less than 30g of carbs and I always add some veggies with a little bit of hot sauce (franks red hot, 0cal) to make them more interesting to eat.

I drink around 2L of water everyday. I have green tea while at work instead of coffee, and nothing else.

I weighed myself yesterday (the end of my second week) and i gained a pound (EXACTLY 1). 

I try to be positive, maybe it’s bloat? I don’t know. 

I weigh myself AGAIN this morning. I’m up to my current weight (up 0.8lbs).

I’m so frustrated. what the HELL am I doing wrong? I don’t understand. I haven’t even had a ""cheat day"" or ""cheat meal"" to treat myself. I’ve essentially cut out all processed sugars and 95% of carbs. 

I’m already at the point where I want to give up. 

WHY am I not seeing results? I don’t understand. I see NO physical changes on my body, so I can’t even reassure myself that way. 

This is it. I just wanted to be below 200 for a vacation coming up in mid march. that was my ""big"" short term goal, which I THOUGHT was completely realistic to lose 15lbs in 1.5 months.

so the whole ""need coffee to function but it makes me anxious"" thing has been my life for years. tried mushroom coffee thinking maybe that's the answer

picked up ryze from target and used it for like 2 months. felt... fine? convinced myself it was working but honestly looking back it was probably placebo. eventually actually read the label and it's all ""proprietary blend"" with no actual amounts listed. did some googling and apparently most of these brands are pixie dusted to hell

ended up finding lucid which actually lists every dose on the label. like you can see exactly how much lion's mane you're getting. costs more but whatever at this point

about a month in now and the focus is noticeably different. no jittery feeling, the afternoon crash is basically gone. idk if it's the transparency or what but something's actually working

anyone else notice a difference when they switched to brands that list doses?",10,1770790316.0,Supplements,11,0.83,False

They are not transparent about when pay periods are and CONSISTENTLY do not pay us on time. Our pay periods are biweekly on the first and third wednesday of the month, then we are supposed to be paid on the following friday (I had to figure this out myself by calculating my hours for the pay when i finally received it).

I have only been paid on the friday of the pay period ONE time since I started working there in november. I have to text my manager (the owner’s 20 year old daughter) 2-3 times about it to finally receive my direct deposit, which is often between 2-5 business days late. She said they were working on fixing this issue, and that the CPA just doesn’t submit payroll on time (???). We also do not receive paystubs. I work directly with the owner 95% of the time and when I try to ask him about it he just tells me to talk to his daughter and that he doesn’t know anything about pay periods… there is also a slight language barrier which does not help.

I really like this job, it is easy, my boss provides lunch for me, my coworkers and customers are nice, I like my boss, and the pay is decent WHEN I FINALLY GET IT. I am also the only employee who actually works hard and is capable of running the store without the owner there (because the turnover is extremely high… because paychecks are never on time!).

I think I need to tell them that I will be finding another job if this issue isn’t resolved, but I feel bad doing that because they will honestly be pretty screwed when I leave. Most of the employees were college kids who went back to school, and the other employees quit or want to quit because they don’t get the hours they want. We literally have 4 consistent regularly scheduled employees who are not the owner’s children (who only work when they absolutely have to). I really shouldn’t care this much about a job paying me 11$ an hour, but I just feel bad because I also think the business is kinda struggling. I am looking for a new job, but it is really difficult to find one that is willing to accommodate a college student. Any advice would be appreciated!",2,1770790301.0,work,2,1.0,False

With hot water and oatmilk the difference is noticeable as well. This is a very good cup of coffee.

The loss of a beloved pet leaves a space that never truly feels empty. Pets are woven into daily routines, quiet moments, and unconditional companionship. During grief, the most meaningful [Condolence Gifts For Pet Loss](https://petperennials.com/) are those that don’t fade with time but instead remain present—offering comfort long after the initial wave of sympathy has passed.

At Pet Perennials, memorial gifts are carefully crafted to become a part of daily life. These gifts are not meant to be momentary expressions of sympathy; they are a constant reminder of love, connection, and memory that eases the pain of grief through daily presence.

# Keepsakes That Bring Comfort Into Everyday Moments

Daily-use memorials are among the most comforting Condolence Gifts For Pet Loss because they integrate remembrance into normal life rather than isolating it.

The Rainbow Bridge Memory Mug is a perfect example. With original artwork wrapping around the mug and the comforting message, “Someone over the rainbow is thinking of you,” it offers quiet reassurance during morning coffee or evening tea. Its durable ceramic design, microwave safety, and dishwasher convenience allow it to be used regularly, making remembrance part of everyday routine rather than something tucked away.

Similarly, the Celtic Knot Pawprint Keychain provides daily comfort through portability. Featuring a pawprint intertwined with a Celtic trinity knot, it symbolizes an everlasting bond. With the option to hand-stamp a pet’s name on the back, this keepsake offers a deeply personal form of [Pet Sympathy](https://petperennials.com/), allowing pet parents to carry their companion’s memory wherever they go.

# Memorial Frames That Preserve Presence and Identity

Photo frames play a powerful role in long-term remembrance by preserving identity and visual connection. They are especially meaningful Condolence Gifts For Pet Loss because they anchor memory in familiar spaces.

The You Left Paw Prints On My Heart Memorial Frame features a heartfelt sentiment accented by silver paw prints, with an optional hand-stamped charm personalized with a pet’s name. Displayed on a shelf, desk, or wall, it quietly keeps memory present in daily surroundings.

The Forever In My Heart Pet Loss Frame adds another layer of intimacy with its wooden heart charm that can be personalized with a pet’s name. Designed to hold a cherished photo, this handcrafted frame blends seamlessly into home décor while offering a deeply personal expression of Pet Sympathy.

For those seeking an even more tangible connection, the Forever Loved Pet ID Tag Memorial Frame allows pet parents to display their pet’s actual ID tags alongside a photograph. These everyday items—once worn daily—become powerful reminders of presence, routine, and love.

# Gentle Sensory Comfort Through Light, Sound, and Ritual

Some of the most enduring Condolence Gifts For Pet Loss engage the senses, creating moments of calm through light, sound, and ritual.

Memorial candles such as the Healing Hearts Memorial Candle and Butterfly Blessings Keepsake Candle offer both emotional comfort and lasting keepsakes. Hand-poured with natural soy wax and infused with calming lavender and chamomile essential oils, these candles provide a soothing ritual. As the candle burns, a hidden keepsake—either a heart-shaped Feng Shui stone or a butterfly keychain—emerges, remaining long after the flame is gone. This blend of ritual and permanence is a gentle form of Pet Sympathy that continues beyond the moment of gifting.

Memorial wind chimes for dogs and cats offer another form of sensory remembrance. Crafted from durable pewter and designed with angel wings, their soft, melodic tones provide comfort each time the wind passes through. With engravable sails and optional hand-stamped pet names, these chimes transform outdoor spaces into places of reflection and peace.

# Living and Visual Memorials That Remain Year After Year

Living memorials and light-based keepsakes provide lasting comfort by returning year after year.

The Pet Perennials Memorial Garden Kits for dogs, cats, and horses enable families to create wildflower gardens using personalized seed wafers made from the included materials. With 16 pet-friendly perennial wildflower varieties, these gardens will bloom every year, symbolizing transformation from sorrow to renewal. For families who prefer, a small portion of their pet’s cremated remains can be incorporated into the seed wafers, making this a highly personalized memorial that is grounded in nature.

Visual memorial gifts such as Crystal Rainbow Suncatchers, Stained Glass Dog on Moon and Cat on Moon Memorial Suncatchers, and the Memorial Pawprint and Angel Wings Glass Ornament turn sunlight into color and warmth. These beautiful objects can be placed in windows, gardens, or special areas and serve as a constant visual reminder of love—a lasting form of Condolence Gifts For Pet Loss that does not fade with time.

Recently, I had to move back in with my parents due to a bad living situation with roommates. My parents were amazing and helped me move on the spot. When I got back, I spent the rest of the day and the following day at my parents home. We continued to move my things after that.

Two days in, after I got their help, I got them dinner, coffee and thanked them. I think I argued with my mom once over a disagreement. A few hours after we finished moving my things, I left the house to spend the night with my partner.

My mom is upset at me. Since I spent a few days there, and then spent all evening at work today, she’s saying I’m not spending time at home, especially after they helped me. She says I’m being inconsiderate. I want to give this the benefit of the doubt, but I can’t think of a reason why I had to stay the night in order to have been considerate- I thought I thanked them and everything was fine?

My mom associates lack of proximity with some negative feelings. I feel like the bad guy, but I stood up for myself and said, I disagree, I don’t think I was being inconsiderate. I think I was too argumentative, I should have not taken the bait and just let the emotions be negative, but I wanted to fix it by talking about it, I wanted to feel vindicated that I don’t do anything wrong by “finishing” our disagreement.

Other than dragging out the verbal conflict, does what I did sound bad? I don’t know what to do next.

can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

Spoiler alert: it barely ever came. And when it did? Gone by lunchtime.

After falling into this trap way too many times, I got obsessed with figuring out why some people just... do things. No drama, no waiting for inspiration, just consistent action. Turns out the answer isn't motivation at all. It's habit stacking, and it's backed by actual neuroscience and behavioural psychology research that changed how I think about productivity entirely.

Here's what I learned from digging through books, podcasts, research papers, and basically every credible source I could find on behaviour change. This stuff actually works.

1. Attach new habits to existing ones, don't start from scratch

Your brain LOVES patterns. It's literally wired for them. Instead of trying to build a brand new habit from nothing, piggyback on something you already do automatically. James Clear talks about this extensively in Atomic Habits (the guy studied habit formation for years, and this book is legitimately one of the best things I've ever read on behaviour change).

The formula is stupid simple: After I \[existing habit\], I will \[new habit\]. Like ""After I pour my morning coffee, I will write three sentences in my journal."" Your brain already has the neural pathway for coffee, so you're just extending it rather than building new infrastructure.

The book also breaks down how habits are the compound interest of self-improvement, which honestly made me reconsider everything. It's a Wall Street Journal bestseller for good reason.

2. Make it so easy you'd feel dumb NOT doing it

BJ Fogg's research at Stanford found that motivation is unreliable garbage (my words, not his). What matters is making the behaviour tiny. Like absurdly tiny. Want to meditate? Start with THREE breaths. Want to read more? One page. Want to work out? Put on gym clothes.

I use an app called Finch for this exact reason. It gamifies tiny daily habits by letting you care for a little bird companion. Sounds ridiculous, but it genuinely works because it breaks everything down into micro actions that feel manageable even on terrible days.

The resistance to starting is always worse than actually doing the thing. Once you're in motion, continuing is way easier.

3. Design your environment so the right choice is the easiest

Your willpower is finite. Stop relying on it. Instead, structure your space so the desired behaviour is the path of least resistance. Put your workout clothes on your bed the night before. Delete social media from your phone. Keep a book on your pillow.

Nir Eyal talks about this in Indistractable, where he discusses how environmental design trumps willpower every single time. He's a behavioural design expert who's worked with major tech companies, and the book dives into how to control your attention in a world designed to steal it. Actually insightful stuff about becoming indistractable in our hyperconnected world.

4. Stack multiple habits into a ritual

Instead of thinking about individual habits, create a sequence that flows. Morning routine example: wake up, drink water, do five pushups, make coffee, read for ten minutes while drinking it, and shower. Each action triggers the next, and eventually your brain just autopilots through the whole thing.

Hal Elrod's The Miracle Morning is built entirely around this concept. He developed this system after a devastating car accident, and it completely transformed his recovery. The book outlines six practices (he calls them SAVERS) that stack together into a morning routine. It's sold millions of copies, and honestly, the stacking framework alone makes it worth reading.

If you want to go deeper but don't have the energy to read through all these books, there's an AI learning app called[ BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450) that turns book summaries, expert talks, and research into personalised audio content. You can set a specific goal like ""build better morning habits as someone who struggles with consistency"", and it generates a structured learning plan pulling from resources on habit formation.

You can adjust the depth, too, from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples. The voice customisation is surprisingly helpful during commutes or workouts. It also has a virtual coach you can ask questions to mid-session, which makes connecting different habit concepts way easier.

5. Track completions, not perfection

Get a habit tracking app or literally just mark an X on a calendar. The visual progress creates momentum. Missing one day isn't failure, it's just data. Missing two days is when you need to investigate what went wrong and adjust.

I mentioned[ Finch](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/finch-self-care-pet/id1528595748) earlier but for pure tracking, even a basic streak counter works. The point isn't perfection, it's consistency over time. Research shows that people who track their habits are significantly more likely to maintain them.

6. Understand the actual habit loop

Charles Duhigg's The Power of Habit breaks down the neuroscience behind habit formation, the cue, routine, and reward cycle. He's a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, and this book is packed with fascinating case studies about how habits work in individuals, organisations, and societies.

Once you understand that habits are just your brain trying to conserve energy by automating repeated behaviours, you can hijack the system. Identify the cue (time, location, emotion, people, preceding action), execute the routine, and ensure there's a reward (even a small mental one like ""I'm the kind of person who does this"").

7. Identity-based habits beat outcome-based ones

Don't say ""I want to run a marathon."" Say ""I'm a runner."" The shift sounds minor, but it's huge. You're not trying to achieve something external; you're becoming someone who does that thing. Runners run. Writers write. Healthy people make healthy choices.

This reframe eliminates the motivation question because you're just acting in alignment with who you are. When your identity shifts, the behaviours follow naturally.

The trap most people fall into is thinking they need motivation to change. You don't. You need systems that make the change inevitable. You need environment design, habit stacking, and identity shifts that remove willpower from the equation entirely.

Motivation is a feeling, and feelings are unreliable. Habits are automatic, and automaticity is how you actually change your life. Once you stop waiting to feel like doing something and just build the systems that make it happen regardless, everything gets easier.

Your brain is incredibly adaptive. It will literally rewire itself based on repeated behaviours. So stop fighting against your biology and start using it. Make the desired action the path of least resistance, stack it onto existing patterns, and track your progress.

The people who seem naturally disciplined aren't more motivated than you. They just built better systems that don't require motivation in the first place.",0,1770789497.0,TheIronCouncil,0,0.5,False

Raised on the wrong side of the cupboard, Tucup Shakur, ( 2CP as he likes to be called ) is a teacup gone bad. Once a lovely vessel for fine, hot beverages now he's resorted to a life of crime and debauchery.

Born in the forgotten back shelf of Granny's China Cabinet, Tucup never knew the soft life of Sunday tea service. While the fine china sipped Earl Grey with the upper crust, Tucup and his crew got the dregs - stale Lipton bags and lukewarm tap water.

The day Granny's grandson used him as a ashtray was the day something cracked inside him. Not just his rim - his whole worldview shattered.

He rolled deep with the Ceramic Cartel, moving hot leaf through the underground cupboard network. Oolong, Darjeeling, that premium Pu-erh - if it steeped, Tucup could flip it.

He's got beef with the Coffee Cups (bougie espresso types), respect from the Mugs (working class, real ones), and the Saucers still owe him from that job in '09. That gold chain? Melted down from Granny's antique spoon collection.

The grill? Sterling silver tea strainer, custom fitted. ""2CP"" tattooed on his handle stands for ""Two Cups or Die"" - his crew's motto. They ride or dry together.a

Second, spaced repetition. I review material for like 10–15 minutes every few days instead of cramming the night before. My stress levels dropped big time.

Third, I study in 45-minute blocks and then take a real break (no scrolling). Quick walk, water, stretch.

Fourth, I write summaries by hand. Typing is faster, but writing helps me remember more.

Turns out, most of us are financially screwed not because we're lazy or dumb, but because our brains are literally wired against wealth accumulation.

Spent way too much time digging through behavioral economics research, podcasts from actual millionaires (not the fake guru types), and books written by people who study this stuff for a living. What I found was wild. Your relationship with money is basically formed by age 7, and most of us inherited broke mentalities from well-meaning parents who were also struggling. Society doesn't help either, constantly pushing consumption while demonizing wealth. But here's the thing: you can rewire this crap.

**stop treating money like it's evil or scarce**

Biggest mindfuck most people deal with is this weird guilt around wanting money. We've been fed this narrative that rich people are inherently bad or that wanting wealth makes you shallow. Pure BS. Money is just a tool. It amplifies who you already are. If you're generous when broke, you'll be generous when rich. If you're an asshole when broke, money just makes you a richer asshole.

Scarcity mindset is the real killer though. When you think ""I can't afford this"" your brain literally stops problem solving. Instead, flip it to ""how can I afford this?"" Completely different neurological response. Your brain actually starts working on solutions instead of shutting down.

**track every dollar like your life depends on it**

Sounds boring as hell but this is where the actual brainwashing starts. Get an app like YNAB (You Need A Budget) or even just a basic spreadsheet. The act of tracking forces awareness. Most people hemorrhage money on subscriptions they forgot about, daily coffees that add up to $150/month, impulse purchases that feel small but compound into thousands yearly.

When you see where money actually goes, you stop being a financial zombie. It's uncomfortable at first because you realize how much you're pissing away. But that discomfort is necessary. Can't fix what you won't face.

**automate the boring stuff so you can't self sabotage**

Set up automatic transfers to savings the day you get paid. Doesn't matter if it's $20 or $200, just make it automatic. Most people fail at saving because they rely on willpower at the end of the month when there's nothing left. Willpower is a finite resource. Automation removes the decision entirely.

Same with investing. Open a Roth IRA or whatever investment account makes sense for your situation. Set it to auto-pull money regularly. Time in the market beats timing the market every single time. Compound interest is actual magic but only if you start.

**consume content that normalizes wealth instead of poverty**

This sounds superficial but it works. Unfollow accounts that glorify struggle culture or make being broke seem noble. Follow people who talk about money intelligently. Not the lambo-flexing dropshipping douchebags, but people who actually built wealth through boring, sustainable methods.

Podcast rec: ""ChooseFI"" breaks down financial independence concepts without the usual condescending tone. Hosts are former middle class guys who figured out how to optimize their way to wealth. They interview everyone from teachers who retired early to real estate investors to entrepreneurs. Makes wealth feel accessible instead of reserved for trust fund kids.

BeFreed is another solid option if you want something more personalized. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia alums that pulls from research papers, expert interviews, and books on wealth psychology to create custom audio content based on your specific financial goals. You can set the depth anywhere from a quick 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with detailed examples and context.

What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan feature. You tell it what you're struggling with financially, maybe it's scarcity mindset or imposter syndrome around earning more, and it builds a structured plan pulling from vetted sources. The virtual coach Freedia can recommend relevant content as you progress. Plus you can customize the voice, some people like the smoky, confident tone for money mindset work. Helps turn commute time or gym sessions into actual learning instead of doomscrolling.

**read ""The Psychology of Money"" by Morgan Housel**

This book genuinely changed how I think about wealth. Housel is a partner at a venture capital firm and former Wall Street Journal columnist, but he writes like a normal human. The book won basically every finance book award in 2020 and it deserves the hype.

It's not about getting rich quick or some complicated investment strategy. It's about understanding that doing well with money has little to do with intelligence and everything to do with behavior. One chapter talks about how a janitor who never earned more than $11/hour died with $8 million because he just consistently saved and invested. Meanwhile, high earning executives go broke because they can't control spending.

Best part is Housel doesn't judge anyone's financial decisions. He just explains the psychological patterns that lead to wealth or poverty. Made me realize that most of my money problems were emotional, not mathematical. Insanely good read that feels more like philosophy than finance.

**reframe how you see ""expensive"" purchases**

Instead of looking at price tags, calculate cost per use. $200 boots you'll wear for 5 years equals $40/year. $50 boots you replace annually equals more expensive long term. Wealthy people understand this instinctively. Broke people often make decisions that keep them broke because they can only afford the cheap option that breaks.

Also, stop trying to look rich. That's what keeps people poor. Actual wealthy people often drive older cars and live below their means. They're optimizing for net worth, not appearance. Social media makes this hard because everyone's faking prosperity, but their credit card statements tell a different story.

**treat income like a variable you control**

Most people accept their salary as fixed and try to budget around it. Flip that. Assume you can always increase income and make that the priority. Side hustles, freelancing, asking for raises, switching jobs every few years (this is how you actually increase salary significantly), learning high income skills.

The book ""I Will Teach You to Be Rich"" by Ramit Sethi covers this mindset extensively. Sethi is a Stanford grad who built a personal finance empire by being refreshingly honest about money. The title sounds scammy but the content is legit. He talks about focusing on big wins (negotiating salary, reducing major expenses) instead of obsessing over $3 lattes. Also has scripts for negotiating raises that actually work.

**surround yourself with people who have healthier money relationships**

If everyone around you is broke and comfortable staying that way, you'll unconsciously adopt those patterns. Not saying ditch your friends, but expand your circle to include people who are building wealth or at least trying to. Their habits will rub off on you.

Wealth building is honestly boring and repetitive. There's no secret. Spend less than you earn, invest the difference consistently, increase your income aggressively, avoid debt on depreciating assets, be patient for decades. That's it. But our brains crave novelty and quick wins, which is why most people fail.

The ""brainwashing"" is really just repetition until new patterns become automatic. Your current money habits took years to form. New ones won't stick overnight. But if you consistently expose yourself to better information and make small improvements, eventually you'll look back and realize your entire relationship with money transformed.

And yeah, luck and privilege play roles. Some people start with advantages. But that's not an excuse to give up. Plenty of first generation wealth builders came from nothing. The difference was they refused to accept their starting point as their ending point.",2,1770788977.0,MomentumOne,1,1.0,False

When was the last time you made something together instead of just going out to eat?

Not dinner.

Not drinks.

Not another “nice place, good food” evening that blurs into the rest.

I’ve been noticing something interesting — couples today spend time together, but rarely create together.

This Valentine’s, I’m hosting a small texture art session in Indiranagar.

Not a workshop in the traditional sense. More like a low-pressure, calm space where couples sit side by side, work with textures, colours, silence, conversation… and leave with a canvas they made together.

No art background needed.

No awkward instructions.

Just hands, materials, soft music, coffee, and time.

Some couples talk while they work.

Some stay quiet.

Some laugh at how messy it gets.

All of them leave with something that feels… real.

I’m keeping it intentionally small because I don’t want it to feel commercial or crowded.

1r1p5sa,https://www.reddit.com/r/youngentrepreneur/comments/1r1p5sa/why_youre_losing_sales_how_to_fix_it/,Why you're losing sales (+ how to fix it),"Hey everyone,

I run 2 businesses and I've spent the last few weeks creating a simple guide called ""The Quick Sales Boost Guide"" and it's already helping people get significantly more sales.

Here's the problem I was trying to solve: Most business owners lose sales because they don't have a system. They respond too slow. They never follow up. They have no social proof.

So I created a guide that fixes all three with actual templates you can use TODAY.

What's Inside:

Response template (copy/paste for every lead) 

\- increases conversions 20-30% immediately

3-step follow-up sequence (Days 1, 4, 7) 

\- recovers 15-20% of ""maybes""

Social proof checklist - get testimonials + reviews fast

30-day action plan - week-by-week what to do

Quick reference guide - all templates ready to use

Real Results:

If you implement even 50% of this for 30 days:

20-30% more conversions from same leads

15-20% recovery rate on leads that said ""maybe""

10-15% more inquiries (from social proof)

30-50% total sales boost

Who it's for:

Service providers (face painting, events, coaching, consulting), freelancers, digital product creators, basically anyone getting leads but struggling to convert them.

I'm selling it for $7 (literally costs less than a coffee) because I wanted to make it accessible to everyone. And there's a 30-day money-back guarantee - if you implement it and don't see improvement, full refund.

It took me 3 hours to create, but the strategies inside are what I've used across multiple businesses and what my clients have tested and proven.

If you want to try it:

Okay so in first chapter Tim is at a coffee shop when someone that looks like a young Bruce (Peter) walks in Peter looks around the store like Bruce would not even realizing he's doing it and noticed Tim watching him. (This is all I remember of this scene.)

Next scene I remember is Peter is at the Library and Barbara noticed Peter sitting in a seat that sees everything after walking inside and checking for all of the exits subconsciously and he's sitting down at the computer Peter taps his finger in the same rhythm that Bruce does. (All I remember of this scene.)

Next scene Peter get's he's kidnapped and meets Damain who noticed who he is right away and starts to question him, they arrive at this place and it's like a lab of some kind anyways him and Peter make their way deeper and find this lab that has all this stuff and Damian says something that causes Peter to say well I'm your friend, (sorry if this is jumping around I'm trying to put it in order the best way I remember.) But anyways Dick (Nightwing) asks Damian where he's at and he says We are heading deeper into the lavatory? And Bruce has no idea about Peter and at this point from what I can remember Jason, Tim, Barbara, and Dick and also now Damian only know about Peter so Bruce is wondering who Damain is talking about while his kids try to make sure he doesn't meet Peter, anyways cutting a bunch as I forgot a lot of it to where Damian and Peter are waiting for Bruce and Batman shows up and asks if they're okay and Peter lists of his injuries like a soldier.

""What changed?"" he asked. ""Everything,"" I said.

""So, what about our dream?""

""Gone.""

""The plans we made?""

""Halfway done.""

""The jungle we called home?""

""Crossed.""

""Good… And what about love?""

""Lost.""

""Well, something didn't change at all,"" he laughed it off.

He told me to show him around, I took him to my place; nothing but ruins.

""What happened here?"" he asked.

I didn't say a word, for I knew it's where our sorrow will confluence.

""At least you moved out,"" he said with a smile, unaware of all the things I've done, so vile.

""What are those scars?"" he asked. ""The cost of growing up, I guess,"" I replied. ""This... isn't how we promised to meet at all,"" he sighed.

He walked into my kitchen, found instant noodles and expired pills.

""Is this dinner?"" ""Sometimes,"" I said, ""most times we forget to eat.""

He then picked up the guitar in my room, old and dusted, the strings rusting, just as I am, each note sounding like a warning.

He checked my desk and found my journal, full of unfinished poems, the coffee stains, and sachet from each morning.

He picked up a picture of mine when I was him, when my eyes used to shine.

""Your smile has faded, eyes are dull,"" he said, comparing the picture to me, scorning. He just stood there in silence, as if he were mourning.

He asked, ""Is this the right time to crush maple?"" ""Yes, you're just in time,"" I said, ""our last April.""

I offered to take him out for a coffee, the same one he used to love.

We sat on the same place where we once planned to meet, with a brighter version of me, not this gloomy man he was forced to greet.

He sipped his coffee in silence. Couldn't blame him, can I? As he just saw his own death through mine.

And if it wasn't already enough, after everything of his that I've effed (f’ed), I dared to light up a cigarette. And as I did, he left.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

My mom always said a child’s soul was like raw iron, something that had to be hammered again and again on an anvil before it could take shape.

Unfortunately, I was that piece of raw iron.

From the time I was five, I wasn’t allowed to smile when I was happy because that meant I was getting carried away.

I wasn’t allowed to cry when I was bullied because, according to them, suffering was a test God gave me and I was supposed to endure it.

When I scored an A-, my parents only asked, “An A-minus? Since when do we settle for less than perfection?”

Whenever relatives praised me for being hardworking, my parents cut them off in public. “She’s faking it. She does nothing at home. Don’t let her fool you.”

Little by little, I learned to bury every emotion and turn myself into the obedient masterpiece they wanted.

When I turned nineteen, my aunt Marie secretly slipped me an envelope stuffed with cash. “You’re grown now. You should learn to manage your own money.”

For the first time in my life, I didn’t hand the money over to my parents.

That night, my dad pried open my cabinet lock right in front of me with a screwdriver.

He held the envelope, his eyes filled with triumph, as if he had finally confirmed his suspicions. “I knew something was off. You’ve learned to steal from us.”

My mom took the envelope full of cash and posted it in the family group chat.

\[Mercy hid money from her parents. This money is blood money. It is a rot in our house. We’ll divide it among everyone as her apology.\]

I stared at my phone as the screen filled with “thank you” messages and praises about how strict my parents were.

I smiled. I didn’t know it would be the last time I smiled in that house.

“Smile? You still have the nerve to smile?”

My father’s hand was a blur, a sudden crack of thunder that left the world tilting on its axis.

I didn’t feel the pain right away, only a sharp ringing in my ears. I stared at the phone lying on the coffee table.

Messages kept popping up in the family group chat.

\[Your family is really strict. Kids shouldn’t have money. They’ll turn bad if they do.\]

\[Mercy looks honest, but she sure is sneaky.\]

The screen was full of cheerful banter. They were thrilled, talking excitedly about dividing the money.

“Do you see this, Mercy? Open your eyes and look!”

My mom shoved the phone into my face.

“Everyone is laughing at you! Hiding money like some criminal. Did Marie give you this? She was testing you!”

Spit flew from her lips as her voice rose higher.

“If we hadn’t found it, were you planning to use this money to buy drugs? To do something shameful?”

My cheek burned, half my face numb, as I slumped against the wall.

“Mom…” My voice rasped like sandpaper. “Marie said it was for my college expenses. I thought… maybe I wouldn’t need to ask you for money anymore.”

“Bullshit!” My dad kicked over the little stool, unbuckled his belt, and snapped it hard through the air. “What makes a girl with rotten morals think she deserves to go to college?”

His chest heaved. “If you’re already hiding money from your parents, what’s next? Robbery? Arson? Are you planning to come back and kill us someday?”

I flinched instinctively and shielded my head with my arms.

“Vernon, not the face.” My mom stepped back to give him room. “We’re visiting relatives tomorrow. If her face is bruised, how are we supposed to explain it?”

“I know,” my dad said, and brought the belt down across my body.

The metal buckle slammed into my back with a dull thud. I didn’t make a sound.

I stared up at the crystal chandelier on the ceiling. The cold white light felt like an interrogation lamp, exposing every corner of this house, leaving nowhere to hide.

When my dad finally grew tired, he tossed the belt onto the sofa and pointed at my face.

“You know you were wrong?”

I slowly lifted my head. Sweat and oil shone across his face, his eyes glowing with the satisfaction of release.

“I was wrong,” I said mechanically.

“What were you wrong about?”

“I shouldn’t have hidden the money. I shouldn’t have been selfish…” I paused, then whispered, “I shouldn’t… be alive.”

My mom looked pleased, like she’d heard the answer she wanted. She nudged my leg with her foot.

“Go write a self-criticism. Twenty thousand words. Explain where the money came from and why you hid it. Post it in the family group and apologize to the elders.”

“If your wording isn’t sophisticated enough, no dinner for you.”

I held my phone, its glow shining over the bruises on my hand.

A new message appeared. It was from Marie.

\[Vernon, Beulah, what are you doing? I gave that money to her.\]

A second later, two notifications popped up.

\[Group owner “Beulah Collins” has enabled lockdown mode.\]

\[“Marie” was removed from the group chat.\]

My mom gave a cold laugh and slipped her phone away. “Marie always acts like some saint. We should see less of her. I don’t want her corrupting you.”

Silence settled over the living room. My parents went to eat, their silverware clinking happily. I lay on the cold floor, staring at the message showing she had been kicked out of the group.

Something inside me shattered completely. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a long time before I typed.

\[Dad, Mom, I don’t want the money anymore. I don’t want my life either.\]

My thumb lingered over the send button. In the kitchen, they chatted and laughed.

“The pasta turned out pretty good.”

“Are tomorrow’s Christmas gifts ready?”

Why? Why did they get to live comfortably while I died?

I erased the message. Then I typed a new one in the group, attaching the self-criticism they demanded.

\[Dad and Mom are right. It was my fault. Please take the money and buy yourselves a little something. Wishing everyone a merry Christmas.\]",3,1770787594.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,2,1.0,False
1r1orgg,https://www.reddit.com/r/LowDoseNaltrexone/comments/1r1orgg/i_need_advice/,I need advice,"I’ve been taking LDN at 0.5 mg for two months now for pots, mcas, chronic fatigue syndrome all those things. Just before I started I had got to the best point I had since I got sick, I was able to go out semi often and even make some of my own meals. I started it and it immediately set me back years mentally emotionally and physically health wise but continued to push through since many ppl have said it’s worth the wait. I’ve been basically bed bound for two months with brain fog and horrible fatigue and anxiety. So I am two days coming off of it and I absolutely have withdrawals. I know it’s debated heavily but if ppl have withdrawal from coffee and sugar then I’m sure I can from a immune system altering medication.

I feel more awake but also throwing up and bad GI issues. It used to help with my bloating but after a month it got worse. I have no idea what my body is doing, it’s lowered my appetite but made me gain weight.

I don’t know if I should wait it out or try and start taking it again. I don’t want to wait and have to restart the two months “progress” I made on ldn letting it accumulate and my body try and get used to it. But it genuinely has ruined a lot for me.

I’ve tried montelukast and I had a severe allergic reaction with hives etc, I feel lost and tired. I made progress and it feels like it’s gone. I need to know if others have experienced this or anything similar and what they did. Or if it will go back to normal or if ldn has made a permanent change to my body.

1r1oran,https://www.reddit.com/r/Qatar_Meet_Friends/comments/1r1oran/searching_after_ultimate_truth/,searching after ultimate truth,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

“I was wrong,” I said mechanically.

“What were you wrong about?”

“I shouldn’t have hidden the money. I shouldn’t have been selfish…” I paused, then whispered, “I shouldn’t… be alive.”

My mom looked pleased, like she’d heard the answer she wanted. She nudged my leg with her foot.

“Go write a self-criticism. Twenty thousand words. Explain where the money came from and why you hid it. Post it in the family group and apologize to the elders.”

“If your wording isn’t sophisticated enough, no dinner for you.”

I held my phone, its glow shining over the bruises on my hand.

A new message appeared. It was from Marie.

\[Vernon, Beulah, what are you doing? I gave that money to her.\]

A second later, two notifications popped up.

\[Group owner “Beulah Collins” has enabled lockdown mode.\]

\[“Marie” was removed from the group chat.\]

My mom gave a cold laugh and slipped her phone away. “Marie always acts like some saint. We should see less of her. I don’t want her corrupting you.”

Silence settled over the living room. My parents went to eat, their silverware clinking happily. I lay on the cold floor, staring at the message showing she had been kicked out of the group.

Something inside me shattered completely. My fingers hovered over the keyboard for a long time before I typed.

\[Dad, Mom, I don’t want the money anymore. I don’t want my life either.\]

My thumb lingered over the send button. In the kitchen, they chatted and laughed.

“The pasta turned out pretty good.”

“Are tomorrow’s Christmas gifts ready?”

Why? Why did they get to live comfortably while I died?

I erased the message. Then I typed a new one in the group, attaching the self-criticism they demanded.

\[Dad and Mom are right. It was my fault. Please take the money and buy yourselves a little something. Wishing everyone a merry Christmas.\]",1,1770787536.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

Chapter 1 

In pharmacology, everyone knew Damian Holmes, Margaret Blythe’s husband. In seven years of marriage, he’d come home only once, and that was on their wedding night. 

People said he poured every waking minute into research, that even his wife needed an appointment to see him. 

When Margaret was in a car crash and rushed into emergency surgery, he stayed in his meeting and let every call go unanswered. 

When she was mugged and left badly hurt, he didn’t offer a single word of comfort. One call from the lab, and he walked out. 

For his birthday, she booked time with him a month ahead. The day came, and she waited outside the research center from morning until night, rain soaking her through. He never showed up. 

Eventually, she realized Damian had a heart of stone. Nothing she did could reach him. 

By their seventh year of marriage, Margaret’s mother, Alma Blythe, was gravely ill. 

All Alma wanted was to see Damian one last time. Margaret went to the research center to find him, only to learn he’d transferred out two years 

ago. 

“Prof. Holmes’s wife had a rough labor two years ago,” the staff member said. “He dropped a classified project in the middle of the night and rushed to the hospital. The delivery took hours. After that, he didn’t want her handling a newborn alone, so he quit the project and asked for a transfer.”

Margaret froze in place. Since when had she ever given birth? 

If that woman was Damian’s wife, then what did that make Margaret? 

“Oh, the girls here adore Prof. Holmes” another staff member chimed in. “They’re always going on about how sweet he is. Sure, he’s a workaholic, but he puts his family first. 

“You probably don’t know this, but he gave up ten years of research just to get that transfer.” 

Margaret’s mind went blank, and a cold shiver ran down her spine. 

Were they really talking about the same Damian she knew? 

She had never been pregnant. Damian had never once come home to check on her. How could he possibly abandon the work he loved more than anything for her? 

She remembered the fury he’d unleashed when she accidentally spilled coffee on his laptop, nearly wiping out his data. And now they were saying he’d given it all up for “family” 

If Damian had left the job two years ago, then where had he been all this time? 

A heavy, nameless dread settled in Margaret’s chest. 

She didn’t know how she made it back to the hospital. Staring at her mother, whose breaths were growing weaker by the minute, she dialed Damian’s number with trembling fingers. 

As expected, he didn’t pick up. 

In seven years, she could count on one hand the times he ever had. 

Later, she handled Alma’s funeral arrangements in a haze, barely seeing straight through the tears**,**

Her mind kept circling back to what Damian’s former colleagues had said. Still, she found herself trying to justify him. Maybe there had been research he couldn’t step away from. 

Or something he’d never found a way to tell her. 

That fragile hope didn’t survive the call from her best friend, Betsy Palmer. 

“Maggie, listen, I think I just saw Damian at the hospital. He was in pediatrics with a woman. I took a picture. Just take a look, okay?” 

Margaret opened the photo, and her breath caught. 

Curled in Damian’s arms was Evelyn Blackwell, the same girl Margaret had supported all the way through college. 

When she reached the hospital, she saw the man she had longed for, loved for seven years, holding Evelyn close, comforting her. 

Evelyn’s eyes were red and puffy from crying. 

Damian leaned down and kissed her tears away. “Hey, don’t cry. Jasper’s got a little fever. He’ll be fine. It kills me seeing you like this.” 

A sudden buzzing filled Margaret’s ears, and the world felt off–kilter. 

She had never seen him look at anyone with that kind of devotion. 

Evelyn wiped her eyes and looked up. “Dami, I saw Maggie’s post earlier. Her mom passed away. Are you really not going to see her? I can stay here with Jasper.” 

He brushed the corner of her eye with his thumb and shook his head, voice low. “I can’t leave you two. She’ll manage on her own.” 

His words rooted Margaret in place.

For years, she’d told herself Damian was just distant, a man who kept everyone at arm’s length. 

To survive his absence, she convinced herself he loved her, just not the way he loved his work. 

But in this moment, that illusion shattered. Damian wasn’t cold by nature. He simply didn’t love Margaret. 

And Evelyn mattered more than his work. 

A child’s cry rose from the emergency room. Evelyn was trying to soothe their two–year–old son, Jasper Holmes, but he wouldn’t stop. “How about Daddy gives you a horsey ride?” she said softly. 

The hallway was crowded. Damian hesitated for a beat, then his face melted into a loving smile. He actually dropped to his knees right there. 

“Come on,” he said, warm and easy. “Climb on and hold tight.” 

Jasper’s crying turned to giggles. He grabbed Damian’s collar and yelled, “Go, Daddy! Go!” 

Margaret stared, dazed. The warmth of that little family hit her like a punch. Every laugh from Jasper cut her deeper. 

Her usually aloof, self–contained husband was now crawling in circles on the floor with the child he’d had outside their marriage on his back, oblivious to the stares around them. 

The room fell silent. 

Margaret blinked fast, forcing the tears back. As Damian drew closer, she turned away and slipped into a corner 

Memories came flooding back, and she clapped a hand over her mouth. 

Margaret first saw Damian at a family gathering.

By then, his name was already everywhere, hailed as a national treasure in pharmaceutical research. 

One look had been enough for her to fall completely. So when the Holmes family suggested she marry Damian, she agreed immediately. 

Alma had tried to warn her. “Damian only cares about his research. Marrying him isn’t a good idea.” 

But Margaret had been naïve. She had believed that loving him enough would make him see her. 

And what had she gotten for it? 

Seven years of marriage, and Damian had come home only once. 

On their wedding night, when she tried to hold him, he pushed her away. “Stop, I’m not into it.” 

Meanwhile, he’d been sneaking around with the college girl she’d sponsored, and they’d even had a child together. 

Everything Margaret had poured into this marriage had turned into a joke. 

She wiped her tears, walked out of the hospital, and sent that photo to her divorce lawyer. 

“Is this enough to make sure my husband walks away with nothing?” she asked. ",1,1770787422.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Her mind kept circling back to what Damian’s former colleagues had said. Still, she found herself trying to justify him. Maybe there had been research he couldn’t step away from. 

Or something he’d never found a way to tell her. 

That fragile hope didn’t survive the call from her best friend, Betsy Palmer. 

“Maggie, listen, I think I just saw Damian at the hospital. He was in pediatrics with a woman. I took a picture. Just take a look, okay?” 

Margaret opened the photo, and her breath caught. 

Curled in Damian’s arms was Evelyn Blackwell, the same girl Margaret had supported all the way through college. 

When she reached the hospital, she saw the man she had longed for, loved for seven years, holding Evelyn close, comforting her. 

Evelyn’s eyes were red and puffy from crying. 

Damian leaned down and kissed her tears away. “Hey, don’t cry. Jasper’s got a little fever. He’ll be fine. It kills me seeing you like this.” 

A sudden buzzing filled Margaret’s ears, and the world felt off–kilter. 

She had never seen him look at anyone with that kind of devotion. 

Evelyn wiped her eyes and looked up. “Dami, I saw Maggie’s post earlier. Her mom passed away. Are you really not going to see her? I can stay here with Jasper.” 

He brushed the corner of her eye with his thumb and shook his head, voice low. “I can’t leave you two. She’ll manage on her own.” 

His words rooted Margaret in place.

For years, she’d told herself Damian was just distant, a man who kept everyone at arm’s length. 

To survive his absence, she convinced herself he loved her, just not the way he loved his work. 

But in this moment, that illusion shattered. Damian wasn’t cold by nature. He simply didn’t love Margaret. 

And Evelyn mattered more than his work. 

A child’s cry rose from the emergency room. Evelyn was trying to soothe their two–year–old son, Jasper Holmes, but he wouldn’t stop. “How about Daddy gives you a horsey ride?” she said softly. 

The hallway was crowded. Damian hesitated for a beat, then his face melted into a loving smile. He actually dropped to his knees right there. 

“Come on,” he said, warm and easy. “Climb on and hold tight.” 

Jasper’s crying turned to giggles. He grabbed Damian’s collar and yelled, “Go, Daddy! Go!” 

Margaret stared, dazed. The warmth of that little family hit her like a punch. Every laugh from Jasper cut her deeper. 

Her usually aloof, self–contained husband was now crawling in circles on the floor with the child he’d had outside their marriage on his back, oblivious to the stares around them. 

The room fell silent. 

Margaret blinked fast, forcing the tears back. As Damian drew closer, she turned away and slipped into a corner 

Memories came flooding back, and she clapped a hand over her mouth. 

Margaret first saw Damian at a family gathering.

By then, his name was already everywhere, hailed as a national treasure in pharmaceutical research. 

One look had been enough for her to fall completely. So when the Holmes family suggested she marry Damian, she agreed immediately. 

Alma had tried to warn her. “Damian only cares about his research. Marrying him isn’t a good idea.” 

But Margaret had been naïve. She had believed that loving him enough would make him see her. 

And what had she gotten for it? 

Seven years of marriage, and Damian had come home only once. 

On their wedding night, when she tried to hold him, he pushed her away. “Stop, I’m not into it.” 

Meanwhile, he’d been sneaking around with the college girl she’d sponsored, and they’d even had a child together. 

Everything Margaret had poured into this marriage had turned into a joke. 

She wiped her tears, walked out of the hospital, and sent that photo to her divorce lawyer. 

“Is this enough to make sure my husband walks away with nothing?” she asked. ",0,1770787372.0,Novelnews,1,0.5,False

I’m not telling people irl unless i have to.  I’ve been trying to get back to an extended fast this year..  I did several 36 in January and do IF regularly;  I’ve never had progress like a straight fast .  I did a five day I think mid 2024.  It was my longest one to date at around 120 hours.  My thought process is -  how much time I have spent just worrying about this one little thing.  I’m tired of dealing with this -  I’m ready to pour my time and energy into other aspects of my life.  Seek my purpose .  Honestly if I could just fast to goal weight-  or at least until I’m out of obesity category -why not?  Our ancestors went without food for long periods of time.  I have plenty of excess to ‘feed’ myself.   Taking it one day at a time?   Disclaimer-  this is liquid fast at this point.  I’m having coffee with a bit of creamer.  So far just water on this one.  Call it a dirty fast.. or not a real fast.   I’ve read scores of posts here.  Open ended.   36  is easy from 24..,5,1770787351.0,fasting,0,1.0,False

“The Revolution Cannot be Limited by Fear”



Chapter 1



For nearly a decade now I have been loyal to the party; loyal to the revolution; and above all else, loyal to the will of the people. What I have found is that sometimes these loyalties contradict, and when they do, people die.

Simply recalling the events I experienced in order to write them here brings me great mental anguish, and an anxiety I have found can only be quelled by my samogon, though the relief is always fleeting, it is fortunately easy enough to make and, for that matter, make a profit from.

The date was the 27th of June, 1926. I remember it as clearly as the day my son was born, the weight just as heavy, only the joy I felt was replaced by a raw fear that I have not felt before and that I have not felt since. I may not be of a sober mind writing this, but even with a clouded consciousness, the screams of my comrades remain as clear as a marching tune in my mind. The old phrase, “Drink is cheaper than sleep” rings deeply true, my friends.

The day began as most others did. Quietly. Rays of sun softly washing over my eyes, gently waking me from my sleep. I stared at the concrete ceiling for a moment. A view I had seen hundreds of times before. And everything was normal. The familiar smell of old laundry, cigarettes, and city smog filled my nose as a noticeable breeze began to seep in and cover my body in a layer of cold industrial air. Sitting up in bed I moved the partially open curtain all the way open to reveal the view my soul had memorized. The Volga river snaking through the developing cityscape, old Tsarist architecture being absorbed into the modernity of socialism. People walking, riding horses and occasionally driving cars or trucks and riding trams, all appearing unbothered and busy with the intricacies of their individual lives. The sky was clear, with the exception of a flock of birds that appeared to be heading West. For a moment I looked at my nightstand and saw an all too familiar photograph of my son and late wife. A photo from before the revolution. So much hope for a future together, shattered in such a cruel way. By the time she had passed, the relationship with my son, Nikolai, had reached its breaking point. Now we rarely speak. He moved on to Leningrad, got himself a scholarship to the Leningrad Polytechnical Institute. I’m proud of him. I cannot fault him for leaving, if I were him I would have too.

 I got out of bed and began my usual process of waking up, changing into my uniform, then to complete the ritual, making my morning cup of coffee. I finished my cup and placed the mug on the counter next to my sink. My leather briefcase was sitting on my kitchen table and I opened it, double checking I had all the documents requested by my intelligence supervisor at the OGPU. I had forgotten some documents pertaining to surveillance of local port workers that had some allegedly Trotskyist leanings. It had slipped my mind because I had left it in my nightstand after adding some annotations to the data before going to sleep, I went to retrieve it. As I did I took another longing look at the photo on my nightstand, ambivalent about the current moment, yearning for a time gone by, but cautiously optimistic about the road ahead. Interrupting my quick moment of reflection, the newly installed telephone in my house began to ring. For a moment I hesitated, staring at the ringing box in the kitchen. *Who could be calling at this hour? Must be important*, I thought. I picked up the phone and put the receiver to my ear. 

“Hello Comrade Shovtin.” A thick gravely voice with an Uzbek accent came through the receiver.

“Who is this?” I asked.

“An old friend.” The voice conceded. “Your presence is requested at the Barrikady Works, Solyanka Sector. A vehicle will be dispatched to retrieve you.”

Then without another word, the line went dead.

I slowly put the handset back on the cradle, and as I did an anxious pit began to form in my stomach. I quickly gathered my things, grabbed my hat and organized my briefcase, finally ready to leave. I stood in the doorway, taking one last look into my humble apartment. It almost felt like it matched my gaze, an invisible presence stalking me from the corners of the room as I stepped away.

Chapter 2



Standing outside the concrete apartment building now, I looked on at the gray, utilitarian walls, the indistinguishable repetitiveness hypnotizing in the way that it gripped me. The crisp morning air slithered its way through my overcoat and the distinct smell of moist river air was omnipresent and sharp. It pulled my attention away from the building I had seen so many times before, one of the many constructed for other relatively unimportant party officials and OGPU officers. *At least I could say I was important enough to have a phone*, I thought. A man in a suit jacket with a scarf draped around his neck and a flat cap was busily rushing by and lightly bumped me. He apologized quickly under his breath, not even looking up to meet my gaze as he passed by. At the time, I paid it no mind. It seemed inconsequential. Just like everything else that morning. 

After a few moments of watching passersby and admiring the proletarian architecture an AMO-F-15 lorry with a canvas cover slowly rolled into view, making sure to give time to the unconcerned pedestrians to move around the car, shuffling around it like a human stream going in both directions. I made eye contact with the driver as he pulled up for a moment, a weathered looking man with a scruffy beard who had an apathetic expression, as he pulled over next to the curb and the truck came to a shuddering halt, he nodded his head in the direction of the back. A silent understanding. I made my way to the back of the truck, lifted up the tarp cover and saw two other men. I had not seen these men before, but I assumed they were in my line of work, so I extended casual greetings and sat down, holding my briefcase in my lap timidly.

Despite the discomfort of being in the back of a truck on mostly dirt roads, the anxious pit in my stomach had faded. Being out of my home with all the memories it holds within was a relief regardless. I saw occasional flashes of the outside world when the tarp was lifted by the wind. Concrete and brick buildings standing tall, looming on both sides like two giants in an eternal slumber, with telephone poles sticking out like stakes through the heart of the earth. The apparent cityscape slowly faded into countryside, but the moist air from the Volga river still sat heavy in my lungs. I tipped down my OGPU cap and dozed off. I knew it to be a long ride, longer still before I would feel the nostalgic melancholy of my own apartment again. 

Sleep and the dreams that followed offered little relief. I was standing in a field. Wheat grain stretching as far as I could see in every direction. There was a weight in my right hand. I looked down, and I was grasping a familiar Mosin rifle. The cold steel and wood numbing the bare skin on my palm. I lifted my head. There was a small wooden hut a few meters in front of me. I heard a voice coming from inside. A woman’s voice. My stomach immediately began churning. I walked to the door, and slowly opened it. I knew this place. A woman, mumbling Ukrainian to herself, stood in the kitchen, fumbling with cookware. I looked upon her. I had a job to be done. I closed the door. Then in a swift motion I lifted my rifle and shot the woman in the chest. There was no gunshot, and she made no noise as she fell. All I heard was my own heartbeat. She appeared to die within seconds. Her empty eyes looked upon me. Beneath a rug next to the kitchen's main counter, was a plank, cut, with a hinge and lock placed onto it. After clearing off the obstructing rug I used the butt of my rifle to smash in the small plank of wood. I peered inside of the hole and it revealed to me what I knew to be there. Grain. The blood of the woman dripped onto the grain, the crimson water tainting the contraband.



Chapter 3



I jolted back into consciousness. As I did I was met with the soft glow of a lantern, and light flooding over stern faces with empty eyes avoiding my tired gaze. 

“How long was I out?” I mumbled, rubbing my eyes; my cheeks were wet with tears.

“Six hours, on or about,” said the man sitting next to me, having pulled out his pocket watch to check the time. I groaned quietly, drying my cheeks with the top of my hands and then stretching out my limbs the best I could in the cramped truck bed. The smell of the Volga river held strong, still staining the air with its presence, its familiarity soothing. Another scent joined it now. The smell of a freshly lit cigarette, presumably from the driver. A nostalgic smell that immediately grabbed my focus. 

“Does anyone have a papirosy they could spare?” I asked. 

Without a word, the man sitting across from me reached into his jacket pocket and pulled out a small worn, silver tin. He opened it, almost ritualistically, pulled out a simple cigarette, thin paper rolled into a tube filled with tobacco. He held it out to me, holding it by the mouthpiece. I grabbed it with two fingers and put it between my lips. He grabbed a cigarette of his own and put it to his lips. He flipped out a small book of matches, drew one out, and struck it against the heel of his boot. He held it up to my cigarette, then his own, cupping the flame in his hands to protect it from the wind occasionally rushing through the canopy. The scent of freshly lit tobacco was comforting. I lightly inhaled. The taste of cheap tobacco sat like dirt on my tongue. A metallic taste began to coat the inside of my mouth as I exhaled. This was not something I was familiar with. I guessed it was just old tobacco. With hindsight, I no longer think it was just old tobacco.

All three of us lurched towards the cabin as the truck came to a screeching prolonged halt. The sound of the brakes squeaking sounded wrong. I cannot explain how, just that it did. Through the crack in the tarp, concrete and metal surfaces were visible. Light was spilling in from outside, the stagnant smoke glowing in the rays with an oily unnatural tint. The sound of boots interrupted my thoughts, the soles clapping against the ground with every step. A man pulled back the tarp, the light rushing in and filling the covered bed, making me recoil for an instant. When my eyes adjusted, I was met with a gaze I had not seen in a long time.

“Comrade Shovtin.” A familiar gravely Uzbek voice spoke. “It’s been some time my friend.”

“Colonel Nazarov.” I replied. “It’s good to see you”

He nodded and watched as I hopped down from the truck bed. When I was eye to eye with him I gave a formal salute that he returned. 

“You can leave your briefcase here. You will return.” He said, face blank as stone. I placed my briefcase inside of the truck, where the 3 other men still sat. He began walking towards the door from which he entered. I followed. As I did, I noticed a feeling inside of my chest I was not familiar with. The anxiety I know so well, tainted with a strange undertone of emotion I cannot meaningfully put into words. I chose to keep to myself and continue after the Colonel. He led me down a long concrete corridor interrupted by metal light fixtures. As we walked I felt trapped in my thoughts, like my will was no longer my own, I felt as if I had become a spectator to my own consciousness. Forgive me if my recollection of events from this point onwards becomes — shaky. By the time we reached the end of the hallway the pit in my stomach had returned with an intensity I have not ever felt. Nazarov put his hand on the doorknob, before turning it, he looked at the wall next to us for a moment. 

“What you will see behind this door,” he paused, “will be unlike anything you have ever seen before. It may change you, it has changed many others.”

His gaze met mine, doing my best to remain stoic and restrained, I spoke. 

“I’m ready.”

He turned the doorknob and opened the door.



Chapter 4



Inside of the room I was met with only a single man. Kneeling. With a bag over his head. He was in prison garb and had his hands restrained in front of him. The only prominent features of the room were a single ceiling light, a drain beneath the man and a steel door with no visible way to open it from our side. Nazarov looked over his shoulder to me. 

“You will see things you do not understand.”

Time seemed to stretch as the Colonel turned towards me, he then drew his Nagant pistol, put the barrel against the man's head, and pulled the trigger. As the shot rang out I closed my eyes. I have seen executions before. It does not please me to admit that I have carried out executions before. I am not one who treats the taking of a human life lightly. But I understand that ideology is a dangerous thing. I ended the lives of many men, class enemies, for the good of the collective. This — this was not that. At least I do not hold that belief. My ears were ringing painfully, it felt as if my skull was going to split from the intensity. I slowly opened my eyes. Blood splattered in a bizarrely symmetrical pattern on the wall, it had the same oily tinge as the smoke in the truck had. The man had collapsed. Almost immediately he began seizing. I could hear a shallow, rattling gurgle. Another shot rang out. I closed my eyes once again and the ringing became even more unbearable. I leaned against the wall behind me. When I opened my eyes again the man was silent. Blood poured through the bag like milk through cheesecloth, forming a growing pool beneath the man's head. The blood began seeping into the drain and the pungent smell of gunpowder and smoke filled the room. Nazarov stepped over the man’s now limp corpse to the door. He knocked, and when he stopped the knocking continued as if someone were mimicking it on the other side. The stone faced man stepped back from the door and it opened. 



Chapter 5



Two guards quietly entered the room. A similar apathetic look painted on their faces, wearing unmarked OGPU uniforms. But as I watched their faces, the edges began to waver, as if being viewed through warped glass. Behind them was another impossibly long looking hallway. They carried a stretcher with them into the room and laid it parallel to the corpse. They rolled him onto the stretcher using their boots. Seemingly indifferent to the fact this was a living man only moments ago. Everything felt wrong, but I stayed silent as they lifted the still leaking corpse and left from where they came. 

If only for a moment, I felt stuck in place, as if my feet had become tree stumps rooted into the earth. Nazarov began to follow the soldiers, but stopped. He looked to me. I stared at the drain, watching the blood pour in. From beneath the drain I heard a deep, rhythmic gulping noise. 

“Come,” Nazarov commanded, ""there is still much to see.”

I looked up to meet his gaze. His features were shifting unnaturally. What I knew was his plain olive uniform, patterned with small geometric shapes that slid and expanded as my eyes adjusted.

Nazarov turned away and began walking after the soldiers. I followed. My thoughts became loud. Every minor emotion felt like tragedy or ecstasy. Walking through the hallway now, a damp smell was present, like that of a greenhouse during the heat of summer. I felt as if I had been swallowed by some concrete giant, and I was now being digested more and more with each step I took. 

After what felt like miles of walking, another door was present. The colonel stood in front of the two soldiers, hand resting on the handle. I stood behind them and watched. Sweat began to form on my brow. The smell of stagnant water, concrete and rust was almost overwhelming by then. I could not read Nazarov’s expression by this point. A dread filled the entirety of my chest, a dread so heavy my breathing became shaky. He pushed down on the door handle and at last, I learned why we were here.



Chapter 6



The door opened, grinding against the floor with a loud echoing screech. I winced slightly, ears still ringing from the gunshots. I nearly gagged as the odor of the Volga river once again filled my lungs as the warm air rushed into the hallway. It smelled vile, as if corrupted by the building itself. 

The room was the size of a warehouse, crossed by large metal catwalks and massive light fixtures hanging from the metal ceiling, heavy steel doors lining the walls. I was led a little more than halfway through the room to a metal railing. On the other side of the railing was a sinkhole. It took up about half of the floor going wall to wall. It looked as deep as multiple standing men and at the bottom there was a black pool. Water streaming in from unseen sources on the walls. Pipes jutted out of the walls, a continuous black stream pouring from them. The smell was overwhelming. The scent hit my nostrils like that of a corpse decaying in a stagnant pond in the heat of summer.

“What is this?” I asked in a broken whisper, trying to steady my voice.

“You will see.” the ever-stoic Colonel answered.

Nazarov looked to the men still carrying the remains of the man on the stretcher. He nodded. As I tried to read their faces with little success, they moved towards the railing and dumped the man. The liquid did not splash when he hit the surface of the pool. There was not so much as a noise. I watched on, wonder and fear fighting within my gut. What I can only describe as the vision of a great project, never seen before, was impressed into my mind. Unfinished work that required form. Work that required hands. A greater purpose, I selfishly imagined.

I looked to the Colonel and he looked back at me. I do not know how long he had been staring, but his gaze did not waver. All I could see was his cold gray-blue eyes staring through a blur of shifting faces that reminded me of people I had seen before: My son, my comrade Sozevskay, who saved my life during the Revolution, the man I had bumped into earlier. But the eyes remained unchanged. I looked back to the void in the floor, which looked as if it was filled with constantly shifting patterns and colors that seemed impossible. 

Another heavy steel door screeched open, echoing almost colorfully. I looked behind me and there, a man stood, wearing the all too familiar unmarked OGPU fatigues, his face as indecipherable and impossibly altered as the others. The man held a clipboard under his right arm and a mug in his other hand. The room he emerged from was dimly lit, and appeared to be another hallway. Though he spoke plainly, his words sounded distant and began to make little sense. He spoke. 

“He looks better than the others,” the blur of textures that made up his face looked to the Colonel, then to me, “this could be promising.”

When I looked back, the outlines had formed what I can only describe as a machine. It was not complete, and still shifting as my eyes adjusted, never still in one spot. I knew what must be done. As I looked into the void that stored its secrets within my mind, I watched as a thin film slowly began to climb the crater for about a meter. Over the course of a few minutes I became mesmerized as forms began to emerge from the film. Small bumps, rings, and pillars. Beautiful in the way it seemingly transformed itself with nothing but its sheer unseen will. 

“What you are seeing,” the man spoke from over my shoulder, clearly through my confusion, “will change history.” 

I felt like I needed to sit down. My mind was so overwhelmed with information and emotion. And how was I supposed to know where reality began and these visions stopped? I could not. 

“Why?” I managed to say in a shaking barely audible voice. 

“We could only hope to understand,” the man replied back. ""There is a limit to what we can grasp. Come. The work has only begun.” The man beckoned me forth. 

I looked to Nazarov. His cold steely glare still pierced through the haze of distortion. Through it I saw the face I knew. His face. He nodded his head in the direction of the man. I took one last look at the pool and the form emerging from it. It felt almost suggestive. Drawing me forth with subtle feelings of a primordial, ancient origin. The forms of many outcroppings began to take more mature shapes. The rings large and flat, bumps and pillars stretching outwards with tips that spread open like umbrellas made of slime. The awe I felt was matched by a gut wrenching fear that filled my entire being. I wondered how much of this I was truly seeing. I looked back to the mug-holding man after a moment of being stuck in thoughts that were as loud as artillery. I followed him through the hall, curiosity and fear making my breathing shaky. 



Chapter 7



	I was led into a room with an examination table. The man stood next to it and gestured at it with his clipboard. I walked to the table and sat. 

“It has occurred to me that we have not had a moment to properly introduce ourselves.” The man spoke.

I stared, silently.

“I am Doctor Mikhail Voronin, at your service.” The man said with a dramatic bow. I studied his face. Though the features continued to shift, it looked familiar but I could not place where I had seen it before. 

“What was that?” I asked, steadying my voice as I did. 

“Truthfully,” the man said in a much flatter cadence, “we are unsure.” 

I said nothing. My eyes failed to read any discernible emotion on his face. He continued. 

“It grows. But not as plants grow,” he paused, turning around and stepping to the side to reveal a small vault with a simple handle. 

“It consumes. But not as animals consume,” he put his hand on the handle and pushed down onto it, opening the small door in a rehearsed fashion.

“And thinks. But not like humans think.” 

 From within the vault the doctor drew out a tray. The tray held a slime covered organic plate. It was about the width of a piece of bread. It was dark. Like a piece of the night sky fallen and captured. Dotted with small specks of matter and tinged with the oily film I was beginning to become accustomed to. He placed the tray to my right. I moved slightly in the opposite direction, unsure if it posed a danger to me.

“Observe if you wish, I will return shortly.” 

I looked at him hoping he would read the concern on my face but I stayed silent. The door screeched as he opened it. He walked through and looked back to me. Then wordlessly, he pulled the heavy door shut. For a moment, my eyes remained glued to the door. My pulse quickened, not from panic, but with restless vibrations that radiated throughout my body. I turned my head towards the umbrella-shaped void. As I stared I felt as if the act of looking was reciprocal. Then the ambient hum of the industrial labyrinth began to take on a familiar, if disjointed, tune. Whispering followed. It matched the beat of the hum. As the hum grew louder the energy radiating from within my limbs synchronized with that which came from without. My leg shot up, an unprovoked reaction to an invisible hammer. For a moment, my mind felt as blank as freshly polished quartz. I could not recall an involuntary reflex so intense, if I had ever had one at all. My stomach began churning with a deep, irrational paranoia. Thoughts began creeping into my mind. 

Old memories of the trenches. Artillery crashing like thunder and the screams of mutilated boys. Dolochetsky dying in my arms, shock glazing his eyes as his life drained from his shrapnel wound. His last words: “Do not falter, for Summer will come bearing the most beautiful gifts man could imagine. We will reap the fruits of our harvest.” the last few words echoing as loud as the explosions that were filling my ears only a moment ago.

A new borscht recipe a comrade spoke with me about the week prior, he insisted that the beets must be sliced thin enough for light to pass through, and the cabbage must dissolve before consumption. “Trust me it is exquisite, you must get it right or it will be the same as any other.”

The face of the man who bumped me that morning. I had seen half of his face, if that. I was not sure which half. It was mirrored in a bizarre, inhuman way.

When we were running just one branch, kaya pa i-adjust manually per shift. Pero nung dumami na staff, dun na nag-start mag-iba-iba yung lasa kahit same recipe sheet.

What surprisingly helped us wasn’t changing espresso, but standardizing syrups for core flavors (Vanilla, Caramel, Hazelnut). We switched to a locally available brand (TOP Creamery) mainly because mas consistent yung sweetness density and hindi overpowering sa espresso. Less “matamis masyado today” feedback.

Still tweaking pa rin, of course. Pero malaking tulong sa workflow — less recalibration sa syrup side, more focus sa espresso dial-in.

Curious lang:  
Sa inyo, gaano ka-big factor ang syrup brand sa final cup quality? Or do you prefer house-made for better control?

1r1oe7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1r1oe7w/aitah_calling_my_bf_immature/,AITAH calling my bf immature?,"**Hi, had to make a burner account for this.**

**I (29F) and my bf, 31M, who I will call Mike,** have been together for 6 and a half years. We moved into this nice apartment, which we been in together for around 2 years

I never had any problems with Mike at all before. He is smart, has a blue-collar job (welder and used to be a mechanic), he's strong, and overall has enough wits to know right from wrong, as we already have boundaries in our relationship.

But around 2 weeks ago i felt as if he started testing how much shit I would take from him. One night, I asked him if he could make me oatmeal and tea because my period cramps were killing me. He seemed slightly annoyed and agreed. At the moment, i didnt really think much about it and ignored the attitude because I could imagine if he had a hard day at work, but like.. it was his off day. anyways he came back with the oatmeal, but it was like REALLY REALLY runny as if he just dumped the water bottle in and threw it in the microwave (it was instant oatmeal, so it diluted the flavor by 80%), being desperate i just ate it and drank the tea. He asked me if I liked it, and I just said yes since I have a problem with people pleasing, but I noticed the slight smirk on his face.

I probably should have said something, but I didn't want to irritate him. We went to bed that night and had no issue, but the next morning, when I got up before him and went to make breakfast i kid you not, he left the mess behind. tea box out of the cabinet, which was still open, the empty oatmeal packet, and sugar on the counter, along with the fucking milk. I felt annoyed but just thought maybe he was tired so i cleaned it up and ate my breakfast, after a while he finally woke up and made his coffee so i politely said ""hey next time could you maybe clean the kitchen after you make food, you left a mess last night"" he went quiet for a second and scoffed before saying ""it isnt that serious, plus you cleaned it up. do i ask you to wash the cars after you drive it to the hiking trail and go on your little jogs?"" i looked so fucking confused because this has NOTHING to do with anything so i just nodded and said ""no but i just asked if you could put stuff back when done"" he just said ""alright""

Fast forward a few days, and I noticed whenever I would ask him to do something for me, small. he would let out a breathy sigh and get up slightly dramatic, like a fucking child, but would do such a poor job. For example; i ask him to fold the laundry, he folds it sloppily. I ask him to cook dinner, and he adds a shit ton of salt or no seasoning at all. All of this led me not ask him to do certain things after. but im confused why all of a sudden. He NEVER once did this before until the whole kitchen incident where I had let it slide off my back easily. its been **2 weeks** of this bullshit, and I'm getting annoyed. Keep in mind I usually do all the house chores, and his only ""chore"" is to just walk the dog or make dinner, which is very, very rare. **I rarely ask for favors and when I do they're small favors.**

This morning, he did the same low-effort bullshit again. I was unloading the dishwasher and asked him if he could put the dishes away in the cabinet while I passed them to him, he sucks his teeth, but complied. I kid you not, as I'm passing him the dishes i hear a plate shatter, so I turn around, clearly confused, just to see this man with his phone in one hand and what was supposed to be the plate on the floor. I finally snapped and said, ""When are you gonna start doing shit the right way and stop being so damn immature? I'm tired of feeling like I'm looking after a child.""

he gets all defensive and said it was my fault for passing the plates so fast, (even though I was going at a slow pace.) We got into an argument and have since been silent, not talking to each other for the past 2 days. He is still leaving a mess around, but I'm not cleaning it since it's not mine. I kept to myself, but now I'm starting to question if I was in the wrong for asking him favors, I mean, hell its not like im asking him to paint me the Mona Lisa, just small help here and there.

AITAH? and what should I do?

edit: he would mention people like andrew tate in convos before he started being immature, so I'm gonna watch a few ""red pill"" since you guys mentioned the term or just ask him if that's what he has been getting into to see if this could have been the cause.

A little about me:

I am someone who loves to read and write, I don’t do it often but I’m trying to make it more of a habit. A current read of mine is Kiss the Villain by Rina Kent. I like watching anime (currently rewatching My Hero Academia), playing video games, knitting, crocheting, and lastly, baking.

I’m a cat owner and coffee lover, this past summer was just me trying different coffee places within my area with my friends. My cat’s name is Minx, she’s about to be 2 at the end of this month.

I am also a huge FNAF, TADC, and Poppy Playtimes fan so if you wanna talk about that I am all ears. I love talking about lore. If anyone would let me, I’d probably make a power point about it 😭.

Anyway, I’ll leave it here, but if anything I have said above peaks your interest, leave me a dm🤍 Yall have a good night!

Edit: I say this with so much love but if you are going to DM me, please put your age. ",0,1770786341.0,r4r,1,0.25,False

Me and my boyfriend haven’t had sex often lately. Only once a week when i come over to his place on my day off. Before we have sex every other day or so. Lately i notice his sex drive significantly decreased. I went to his place last night as usual but we didn’t have sex (i went to bed before him cuz i couldn’t wait as i got sleepy and he took too long to come to bed). He told me it’s because he’s busy and has a lot of things going on as he’s trying to get his coffee shop ready to open next week. He does masturbate tho. So it made me think does he not enjoy our sex? Or he’s cheating? But i can’t find a time where he can go out and cheat cuz we do have dinner together daily. It really confuses me cuz whenever we had sex, he seemed like he loved it and couldn’t control his orgasm. Can anyone give me an advice? Do you think he’s just no longer enjoy and looking forward to our sex?

I run a few professional communities on Slack and I've been trying to figure out the best way to help members find and connect with each other. Right now it's mostly organic as people find each other in channels. Sometimes I manually intro people when I know there's a good fit.

The random coffee chat thing is fine but it feels like a coin flip whether the match is actually relevant. Has anyone implemented this successfully? How was your experience with it?

I (42F) have been married to my spouse (42M) for 14 years, let's call him Ken. We have 2 boys (12 and 5) and we are both very supportive of each others goals.This year Ken felt it was time to take steps towards his career of choice. His transition involves him stepping down from his managerial role and no more overtime. I picked up an extra day with my job to help maintain our income. He's now closer to home and has more time to spend with family and focus on his career path. These were his reasons for stepping down.The downside... I've noticed that he has been slacking on the family/household duties. Ken works 4-5 days per week, and usually gets home around 3pm, so that gives him about 3.5 hours to take care of things before I get home. Over the last 2 weeks I come home and the kids haven't done their chores or homework (they're just sitting in front of the TV), dinner isn't started yet, no baths taken, the house is a mess, etc. yet he's usually sitting at the dinner table elbows deep in a project for his career. I spend about 20-30 minutes to decompress after work, then jump right in to pick up the slack. This means we aren't eating dinner until 8 - 9pm, then we're rushing the kids to bed around 10pm or later. I clean up after dinner, prep his coffee for the morning, make sure he has clothes ready for work, etc. I do all of this without complaint. I have mentioned several times that he should try to finish his ""work day"" by the time the kids get home so we all can focus on our household chores and get the kids to bed on time for school the next day. Tonight, I told him I was, ""trying to find a way to tell him something without being offensive"". He told me to, ""just spit it out,"" so I told him that we need to find a way to have dinner ready before 8pm. Which he took as me 'pointing out his failures,' and blew up.  Today's excuse: his feet were really hurting him so he had to take time to soak them. He decided to use that time to also post items up on his Etsy shop.Then he had to put up a post before 8pm, so that stopped him from helping me out with dinner (a dinner he said he wanted to make today). He then went on a rant about how I don't ""really"" support him with his career. He then tells me he wants me to share all of his social media posts every day. He's said this before, and although that's 3 posts per day I usually share posts about once or twice per month. I told him, ""so basically your asking me to duplicate your page on my profile like a hostile takeover,"" is the exact words I used. I explained to him that I thought his request was unreasonable. He said that's besides the point, because that's what a supportive spouse would do. I feel that he's infringing on the tiny slice of individuality I get as a married heterosexual woman. So I come to Reddit with the question: Am I the asshole for not allowing my husband to take over my social media account?",14,1770786101.0,AmItheAsshole,20,0.89,False

1r1o9tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1r1o9tj/the_scale_is_my_arch_nemesis/,The scale is my arch nemesis.,"Hello!! I am currently struggling with my weight and trying to shed a few pounds. I feel my weight as of recently has been for the most part consistent, but on days where I eat a little more it will fluctuate but will go back to my original weight.

I am 5’4, 125. Just a few months ago, I was 140 and was able to get as low as 116 and was steady at 120. I was very happy being at that weight and liked where I was at. But now being that I’m 125, but scale goes up more than down and I’m growing frustrated. If anyone can give me advice or tell me where I can improve?

As soon as I noticed 125 on the scale, I started doing cardio. It’s been about 1 month and a half. So new year. Holidays got to me. I do 4-5 days, 10,000 steps. On a lazy day I’ll do 8,000. Then I incorporated once a week Pilates (so far has been a month).

I only eat out once a week. The rest of the week I cook at home. I don’t eat very clean but I do eat healthier meals as I do like to watch what I eat. I drink lots of water. I did JUST turn 34, so not sure if getting older has a factor. But honestly don’t want to think it’s that. I eat lots of tuna, eggs, chicken. Nothing too clean but try my best to stick to healthier options. I try not to drink my calories either.

On a regular day, I’ll have oatmeal with banana, scoop of peanut butter, and granola and coffee for breakfast. I don’t eat at work, just snack like nuts, fruits or beef stick. Then at home I’ll have a big dinner so I won’t snack. I’ll walk another 30 mins after dinner sometimes. My job doesn’t require much walking and is a sedentary position so that’s why walk during my days.

Once in a blue moon I weighed 200 so I know I should be proud of where I’m at, but because of my history with weight is why I’m paranoid. Any advice on what I’m doing wrong? I’m feeling very discouraged..",1,1770786089.0,Advice,12,1.0,False

I have a normally sweet, empathetic, and wonderful 4.5 year old. Today, he did something really out of character, and I am seeking guidance on an appropriate punishment.

  
When we got home from school today, I put on some music so the boys (4.5 and 23mo) could dance. I check in with my wife and we start prepping for dinner. Within 3 minutes, I see my oldest grab my youngest by the shirt and throw him to the ground - hard and far. The youngest bashed his eyebrow on the coffee table, and blood was everywhere. It was a deep gash that required a visit to urgent care and stitches. 

My oldest immediately knew he did something serious.  I was stern with him right away, then gave my attention to the youngest to take care of the wound. Oldest was crying from the shock of it all and genuinely said ""I'm so sorry"" through tears over an over again. He continued to cry and was wound up for the entire time it took to stop the bleeding and calm my youngest down.

Once things had settled and my oldest had stopped crying, I asked him calmly why he threw his brother to the ground. He said that the youngest was reaching to press a button (bluetooth, input, etc.) that would turn off the stereo and he wanted to dance. I just said ""Ok"" and took the youngest to get stitches, but ever since I've been thinking about how to handle this with him. By the time I got back, my wife was wrapping up bedtime and we all came in to say goodnight quickly. 

My intuition says that he's old enough and emotionally mature enough to handle a conversation about this. He understands this is well beyond an accident, and what he did was further than a gentle push or box out to protect a button. But I can also see that this is just typical brother behavior and if the coffee table had been a beanbag, it would have been in bounds. 

We've been into TMNT lately - nearly through season 3 of the 2012 iteration. Yes it's a little too old for him, but he doesn't get scared, and I enjoy helping him digest the relationship stuff at bedtime.  I am strongly considering taking it away if its subconsciously making his first instinct violence like this. 

The youngest will  have a scar across his eyebrow (honestly like Jason Momoa, so we will lean into that!) his whole life, so oldest will have to see that and remember his actions every day. Other than that, what is the course of action here? Talk is mandatory, but what - if any - punishment goes with it?
