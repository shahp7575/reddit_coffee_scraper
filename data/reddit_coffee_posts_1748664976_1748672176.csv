I found such bad coffees several times. And it’s always to do with oxidised coffee that felt unpleasant and stale out of the bag, despite these coffees costing almost 1000-1200 for a 250 grams bag.

The grease-stained menu in front of him seemed as uninterested in his decisions as the waitress who had just shoved a plate of pancakes in his direction. He didn’t care. He wasn’t here for the food—he was here for the deal.

He glanced up when the bell over the door jingled. A woman entered, one whose leather jacket and aviator sunglasses screamed ""Don’t mess with me."" But it wasn’t the attitude that caught his attention—it was the fact that she was walking straight toward him with a briefcase, her every step purposeful, her lips curled into a small but noticeable grin.

""Jake Parker,"" she said in a voice that sounded like it had been dipped in honey and set on fire. ""We need to talk.""

Jake gave a half-smile. ""I’m guessing you’re the Tooth Fairy? Or do I need to get a second opinion?""

""One and the same,"" she replied smoothly, sliding into the booth across from him without waiting for an invitation. ""Though I’m not in the mood for small talk. You have a debt that needs settling.""

Jake leaned forward, one elbow on the table. ""Yeah, that’s what I figured. Last time I checked, the agreement was clear: you take my molar, I get twenty bucks. Simple transaction, no funny business.""

The Tooth Fairy grinned, and it was the sort of grin that promised trouble. ""And you’re a man who likes a simple transaction. But the times have changed, Parker. The tooth economy is in flux. Cash is… inconvenient these days. I’m not in the business of leaving coins under pillows anymore.""

""Right, I’m sure it’s because of inflation or something."" Jake snorted. ""So what’s the deal now? You here to offer me a coupon for free dental work?""

""Better,"" she said, snapping open her briefcase to reveal several neatly stacked pieces of parchment, each one topped with a shiny seal. ""I’m offering you a choice. You can take an asset or a wish. No more pennies, no more nickels. We’re playing in the big leagues now.""

Jake raised an eyebrow. ""Asset? What, you mean like stocks? Real estate? Please tell me you're not offering me some tooth fairy-themed version of Monopoly.""

The Tooth Fairy leaned back in her seat, crossing her arms with a knowing smile. ""Not quite. Think bigger. You could have shares in a company that… let’s say, specializes in personal dental care—you know, the kind that doesn’t just deal with teeth but the entire ‘health’ of a person. Or,"" she continued, ""I could offer you a wish. Just one. And that wish could be anything, as long as it doesn’t break the laws of nature. Or, you know, cause an existential crisis.""

Jake’s eyes lit up. ""A wish? Well, now we're talking. But I’ve been around the block enough times to know that there’s always a catch. What’s the fine print?""

The Tooth Fairy’s grin grew wider. ""No fine print, Parker. Just one little stipulation: the wish is a one-time deal. You can’t wish for infinite wishes. That’s been done before, and it never ends well for anyone involved.""

""Sounds like I need to get creative,"" Jake said, tapping his chin thoughtfully. ""I’ve got a few ideas, but I think I’ll go with something practical. I’m tired of airport security. I can’t stand getting pulled out of the line just because the TSA agent decided my shoes look suspicious. So, I’ll take the wish. I want the ability to breeze through airport security without ever being stopped for a pat-down or a scan. A lifetime pass. Is that possible?""

The Tooth Fairy’s eyes twinkled. ""A lifetime pass through TSA, huh? Bold choice. I could’ve sworn you were going to ask for a money tree or, I don’t know, a genie in a bottle. But this? Practical. I like it.""

Jake’s grin matched hers. ""I figure, why deal with the hassle when I can just skip it entirely? No more feeling like a criminal every time I fly.""

The Tooth Fairy sighed dramatically. ""Alright, deal. You’ll get your wish. But remember, every gift comes with a little… complication.""

Jake nodded, unfazed. ""Yeah, I’ve learned that the hard way. What’s the catch?""

""Simple,"" she said, flipping the briefcase closed and standing up to leave. ""You’ll breeze through airport security with no problem. But don’t expect the same treatment when it comes to people. You’ll find that your personal relationships are… well, more scrutinized than ever.""

Jake blinked. ""Wait, what? I’ll be able to skip TSA but not, you know, awkward dinner parties? That sounds like a raw deal.""

The Tooth Fairy smirked. ""Oh, it’s not that bad. But you’ll find that people start questioning your motivations more often. It’s a small price to pay for easy travel.""

Before he could protest, she was gone, the bell jingling as she left the diner.

Jake sat back in his booth, arms folded, as he watched the Tooth Fairy vanish into the street. He wasn’t quite sure what to make of her—she had a way of making everything sound like an international conspiracy wrapped in glitter and teeth—but he figured it would be fine. After all, a lifetime of easy travel? That was worth a little scrutiny in his personal life, right?

Just as he was about to take another sip of his coffee, the door opened again, and in stepped Helina.

Helina was Jake’s oldest friend, though “friend” might have been a stretch considering how often she ended up dragging him out of trouble. She was smart, practical, and—most importantly—she knew how to keep her cool when things got weird, which, as Jake had learned, was no small feat.

She marched straight to the booth without a word, dropped into the seat across from him, and fixed him with a raised eyebrow. ""I can’t believe you're still in one piece. Who was that woman, and why do I have the distinct impression she’s not here to sell you insurance?""

Jake chuckled, leaning back. ""Oh, that was just the Tooth Fairy. No big deal. She owed me some money, and we worked out a deal. A wish, actually.""

Helina narrowed her eyes, folding her arms across her chest. ""A wish? Seriously? You went with that? You didn’t think for one second that there might be strings attached?""

Jake shrugged, unfazed. ""I asked for something practical. TSA-free travel. No more getting pulled out of line for some agent who’s decided I look like I’m smuggling something. Seems like a fair trade.""

Helina’s gaze softened, but only for a second. Then she let out a deep sigh. ""Jake, I don’t even know why I bother sometimes. You’re taking wishes from a supernatural creature who clearly has no idea what personal boundaries are. What happens when you start getting weird looks from your family because you’re not getting patted down at the airport?""

""I figure I’ll just tell them I’m on a special diet,"" Jake said, his lips twitching into a smirk.

Helina shook her head. ""You never learn, do you? Alright, well, I guess it’s too late now. What else did she offer? Stocks in some shady company? Free orthodontic work?""

Jake chuckled. ""Nope. She offered me assets, but I passed. Not into the whole ‘tooth real estate’ thing. I went for the wish. And I’m sticking with it.""

Helina leaned back in her seat, her arms still crossed. ""Well, good luck with that. Just remember: the world doesn’t work on a one-size-fits-all model. If you want an easy ride through life, someone always expects payment later. And that someone is probably the Tooth Fairy.""

Jake smiled lazily. ""Yeah, yeah. I know. But for now, I’ll take my wish. Let the world figure out what to do with me.""

Helina rolled her eyes. ""I’m just glad I’m not the one who has to pick up the pieces after your wish inevitably blows up in your face.""

The Aftermath

The next day, Jake Parker found himself at the airport, breezing through the security line with a smug grin plastered on his face. He barely noticed the stunned looks from the TSA agents as he passed through the metal detectors with no hassle, no questions, and no second glances. It was as if he was invisible to the system, like some kind of VIP pass holder who didn’t even need to show a badge.

But as he walked through the terminal, heading toward his gate, he noticed something odd. People around him were suddenly giving him very strange, very scrutinizing looks. A woman gave him an overly friendly smile before walking away in a hurry. A man in a business suit seemed to look him up and down as though he had just found a fly in his soup.

Jake frowned. ""Huh. Helina was right.""

As he sat down in the terminal, he pulled out his phone, only to see a string of messages from family and friends asking if everything was okay. His social media was flooded with confused comments, people asking why he wasn’t getting stopped at security. Some were joking, others were suspicious.",1,1748671669.0,fantasy_books,0,1.0,False

I (25M, quiet and sensitive) have been working with a coworker who is around my age for about 3–4 years now. We joined the company at the same time and have always worked well together – professionally and with mutual trust – but our relationship has stayed purely work-related and formal.

Lately, though, I’ve started to feel a desire to get to know him outside of work too – mainly because I can really imagine becoming friends with him. I’m not looking for a relationship, at least not primarily – I’m open to it if something were to develop naturally in the future, but that’s not the goal. What I truly want is a real, honest friendship.

What draws me to him is not just how well we work together, but also how he reacts to certain situations. For example, when others tease him playfully, he tends to go very quiet – it comes across as sensitive to me, like there’s a side of him people don’t really see. That’s what makes him interesting to me as a person.

We recently followed each other on Instagram – he followed back right away. Since then, I’ve noticed that he suddenly started using emojis in our Teams chats – something he never did before. That might seem minor or irrelevant to others, but I tend to notice and feel small shifts like that quite deeply.

From what I’ve gathered about him: he’s into soccer, likes to party, travels a lot, and seems to enjoy video games. But personally, we’ve never talked about anything outside of work – it’s always remained purely professional.

Earlier this week, I tried to casually ask him out for coffee, but it didn’t work out due to work stuff. Some friends of mine suggest I should just send him a lighthearted message on Instagram – maybe a funny meme as an opener. Others think I should talk to him directly at the office and ask if he wants to grab lunch sometime. And then there are more cautious voices – some people mention that he might have a girlfriend, based on office gossip.

One thing that keeps me thinking: since we followed each other on Instagram, he seems a bit different – subtle but noticeable. He uses emojis in chats now, and he’s also slightly more helpful and responsive than he used to be. Maybe it’s nothing – but as someone who’s pretty sensitive, I tend to notice even small changes.

A close friend of mine, who’s also gay, advised me to be direct before I overthink and get stuck in speculation. He went through something similar once and now says he regrets not recognizing the signs or making a move. He also said: “Just because someone has a girlfriend doesn’t mean he’s fully figured out his own orientation – sometimes people are just under social pressure.”

But I don’t want to assume anything or build up expectations. I just want to find out – in an honest, respectful way – whether I could get to know him better as a person, after all these years of working side by side. If it turns into something more someday, fine – but what I really want is a genuine personal connection.

I’m not someone with a big friend group. I have maybe 2–5 close friends – some I’ve known for over a decade, others I met through gaming or social media. I struggle to make new connections, but I deeply crave real, meaningful relationships – especially in everyday life.


My questions for you: 
• How would you approach someone you’ve only had a professional relationship with so far? 

• Would it be okay to casually message him on Instagram (e.g., start with a meme or something like: “Hey, random question – do you game? I think I overheard you mention something in the office once… or was that [Colleague X]? 😅”)? 

•  Or would it be better to ask him in person at the office to grab lunch, without making it too heavy? 

• How do you personally deal with uncertainty when trying to connect with someone – especially if you’re more reserved? 

• And how do you even tell if someone likes you in a friendly (or possibly more) way? • One last thing: I often feel like he waits for me to make the first move before he responds. Why might that be?


Thanks for reading – I’d really appreciate honest thoughts, especially from people who are also on the more careful and sensitive side.",1,1748671236.0,askgaybros,1,1.0,False

So i met this girl in my uni cafeteria and how i met her was that i was buying my everyday coffee and i felt a tap on my shoulder and it was the most beautiful girl i have ever seen and she told me she liked my hair and that she loved my curls and at first i was like oh ok thx but then i kinda realized that she was flirting so i said the same thing back and we got off instantly, we were both fans of one piece and we both asked for each others IG at the same time and it was a cute moment. So fast forward a bit we started talking everyday and watching one piece together and going on dates and it was beautiful, it was like the first time i felt really loved and not being used. I did some things woth her that where my first like for example she was the first person ever that i ever bought flowers for and she was the fisrt that i ever introduced to my mom and things where beautiful. So fast forwaard one day she was at my house and she was asleep and i was just touhcing her hair like very gently and well she got mad because she didnt like physical contact (she had told me beforehamd that she didnt like being toched that much but things like that she like passed it) and i was like ok sorry but then after that things just went downhill, she wasnt the same and she even told me she liked a girl and i was like ok damn why you telling me that we are supposed to be in something. So one day she told me that she thought about it and she didnt want a relationship with me and i was like ok but i dont want to stay friends because it hurst still. So 3 days later she started talking to me again and she is my soft spot and she was going through something and i just wanted her to be okay so thats why i talked to her still but the thing is she started callign me things like ""baby"" ""honey"" things like that again and i was very confused and sometiems she told me that she wanted to say something but didnt because it would be the best for both of us and things like that but at the time like 2 weeks later after we broke up she started seeing somebody else and like two weeks later she broke up with him and guess who the first person she told was, me, but i stayed there tellign her that she didnt deserve beeing treated like she did and she was ""worth the earth the sun and the moon"" and things like that and we started talking even more after that and then she dropped a bomb that she liked somebody and safe to say i got pretty sad but accepted it. She started seeing him and got into a relationship with him and it is safe to say that i suffered everytime she mentioned it or she posted a video with him and i just imagined and still imagine what wouldve happened between me and her if things went diffently. So back to the story, every time they got into an argument or something i was the one she looked for comfort and there i was  listening to her and comforting her and i even went to her house just to spend time with her and we went on drives and she would tell me everything and i would just listen to her and it got to a point that she even blovked me because her bf told her and we didnt talk that much except when something bad happened and she went looking for me and i would commfort her again and again and that went on for like a year. So recently they broke up and i was there again comforting her again and we started going out more to like drink coffee or to study and things like that and recently she has been like talking to some people and idk i just feel like my heart is being crushed every time she tells me she sees someone cute or that she went out with someone and idk how to feel honeslty. I feel like at this point it is maybe my fault for not letting go and still holding on to the slim chance that i will get her to like me. I dont see myself with no one else honestly and i think that she is the loml but im just not hers.

So yeah thats my story and i just wanted to get this out of my chest and i hope she doesnt see this and recognizes something ahah. thanks to anyone that read the whole thing ",1,1748671099.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

Heartbroken, he begs her to believe him just once, but she walks away.Now, as Kenneth prepares to leave the country, Adeline’s world starts to crack.Chapter 1 DivorceKenneth Guzman's wife cheated on him.Today was their wedding anniversary, but Adeline Hatfield was off spending the night with her old flame.Just as Kenneth got up to dump the cold food on the table, he heard someone entering the password at the door.He froze.Adeline came in with a shopping bag, her face etched with tiredness. A gust of biting wind blew in as she entered.She glanced up at Kenneth, put the bag down by the entrance, and said, ""Happy birthday. Sorry for coming back so late. Got some work to do. Try this. See if it fits.""Then she walked straight into the bedroom before Kenneth could approach her.After standing at the door for a long time, Kenneth finally walked over to the bag. Seeing the label, he couldn't help but sneer. It was a high-end Shuecian custom brand with only one domestic store.Sounded like Adeline had put some effort into his birthday, right?But he never wore this brand. He didn't even need to take the clothes out. Just by looking at the color, he knew who it was meant for.After quietly standing there for a good while, he looked down and murmured a thank-you but left the bag right where it was.Adeline didn't notice the cold food on the table or bother to ask if Kenneth had eaten. While she was walking to the bathroom, her phone rang, and that familiar ringtone got on Kenneth's nerves.""Brennen? I'm home. What's up?""Kenneth felt every ounce of strength drained from his body, leaving him exhausted.He and Adeline had been married for five years, but they had hardly spent any time together. She was always off at conferences or just gave him the cold shoulder.Just then, there came a knock at the door. Kenneth got up to open it and saw his mother-in-law, Carolina Hatfield.""Carolina,"" he softly greeted her as he moved aside to let her in. ""Adeline's back. She's in the shower. I'll make you some coffee.""Carolina caught sight of the untouched dishes on the table, and she couldn't help feeling sorry for Kenneth.She took his arm and sat him down on the sofa, asking, ""Kenneth, about my suggestion, have you decided on it?""The wind howled outside, snow tapping against the windows. Inside, it was warm, but Kenneth's hands were icy.Seeing the exhaustion in his eyes, Carolina felt like crying.""I... I'll do what you asked,"" Kenneth replied.Carolina nodded. ""Back then, we kinda took advantage of you. But we can still make things right."" Her gaze drifted toward the bedroom, where water ran steadily. Then she added in a whisper, ""After the divorce, both you and Adeline can get back on the right path. It's my fault. I never should have agreed to this marriage.""Their marriage was basically a deal.Back then, Adeline was still in college. She was hopelessly in love with Brennen Everett, even willing to give up her status as the family heiress just to elope with him.But on their way, they got into a multiple pile-up.Kenneth's mom was also a victim of that accident. Kenneth happened to be nearby, so he rushed there to help. After pulling his mom out of the car, he also rescued Adeline, who was stuck.Brennen had been pulled out of the car even before Kenneth got to Adeline, so Kenneth never saw him.Later, he heard Brennen's family caught him and sent him overseas that very night.And that was the last time the two lovebirds ever saw each other.Then came Adeline's sudden proposal, catching Kenneth off guard.After that car accident, Kenneth's mom got really sick, with lots of organs failing. He spent a ton of money on her, but she wasn't getting better.The Hatfields, grateful for his help, stepped in. They moved his mom to a private hospital, got her all the fancy equipment, and brought in the best doctors they could find. They did everything they could to save his mom and even covered all the costs.On the day Adeline brought up marriage, Kenneth's mom suffered another massive hemorrhage. He didn't want to ask the Hatfield family for help, so he used up all his scholarship money to pay the bills. But it still wasn't enough.Just then, someone reached out from behind him, holding a card between two fingers. ""Use this,"" she said.He turned around and saw Adeline.She looked radiant, way better than when he had pulled her from the wreck. He stared at her for a few seconds, then looked down and whispered, ""Thanks. I'll pay you back.""""No need.""After Kenneth paid the bill, Adeline stayed with him and waited outside the operating room for four hours until his mom was finally out of danger.""Kenneth Guzman, a top student in the School of Business at Entomont University. Your dad cheated and ran off with all the money, and your frail mom got in a car crash."" Adeline rattled off Kenneth's life story like she was reciting a script.The next second, her eyes got red. She grabbed Kenneth's cold, trembling hand and added with a determined look, like she was making a big gamble.""Do you want to marry me?""It was an out-there question. But after Kenneth saw the tears in her eyes and thought about the Hatfields' help, he realized this was some kind of deal, and he didn't have the right to say no from the beginning.It wasn't until later on that he found out Brennen had gotten engaged to some other rich girl the same day Adeline proposed.Looking back, Kenneth felt pretty okay with it all.""Carolina, no, Mrs. Hatfield, I said from the start, I'll pay the money back. Marrying Adeline was my decision. No one forced me. You don't need to feel bad about it.""Over the past few years, Adeline's parents had been nice to Kenneth. They knew Adeline was still into Brennen, so they had always gone out of their way to be good to Kenneth. They could tell he was a smart man.But half a year ago, Brennen returned from abroad.To everyone's surprise, the first thing he did was to get back in touch with Adeline. Since then, she had been coming home late, even staying out all night sometimes. The only thing she told Kenneth, who was waiting at home, was that she had to work overtime.It was such a lame excuse, but she didn't even bother to come up with a better one.""Here's 500 thousand dollars. I've arranged a school for you abroad. I know that not being able to pursue a master's degree has been bothering you. Go ahead and continue your studies. Hudson and I will support you.""By the time Adeline came out, Carolina had already left.Kenneth didn't touch the card. After cleaning up the table, he got into bed.""Did my mom come over?"" Adeline asked.Kenneth was all groggy and about to drift off, so he grunted in response.Adeline snorted, ""Stop taking money from her. Everyone at home thinks I'm mistreating you.""Something thudded next to his pillow. He didn't know what it was until he woke up the next morning—it was a card.As he picked it up, he remembered what Adeline had said last night before he fell asleep.""Don't always stay cooped up at home. You've got no place to spend the money. Go out and visit your mom's grave more often. I'm too busy. Buy something and go see her yourself.""So Kenneth did.He squatted in front of the tombstone in silence for a long time.Then he wiped the dust off the stone and stared at the smile on his mom's photo.After placing the card on the step, he finally spoke up, ""Mom, Adeline is busy as always, so it's just me again. But she's always been generous.""The tombstone surely wouldn't respond. And the wind seemed to hold a quiet sorrow.Kenneth continued, ""I think I want a divorce.""Chapter 2 SignatureKenneth quietly bowed his head, like something had slipped from his eyes. Only the tombstone seemed to hear his whisper, ""If only I hadn't gotten married.""On his way back, he stopped by the law firm to pick up the divorce papers he had prepared a while ago. He had been ready ever since he first brought it up with Carolina.He figured that since Adeline didn't have any feelings for him, it was better to split up sooner. That way, he wouldn't get in the way of her making up with Brennen.Kenneth didn't have many things in the house. It was like he had known this day would come from the start, so he didn't leave any personal stuff around. After packing for the whole afternoon, he only had a small suitcase.If it weren't for the five years he had lived there, he'd think he was on a business trip.That night, Adeline got home early, which was unexpected. She opened the door, but instead of the usual warm, cozy feeling and Kenneth cooking in the kitchen, it was eerily quiet. It gave her the creeps, and she automatically took out her phone to call Kenneth.Meanwhile, in the School of Medicine at Entomont University, Kenneth's old mentor, Marco Riley, was shocked by how much he had changed.Just five years of marriage had turned a once bright and energetic young man into someone who looked down and stuck. This was his best student, the genius he always believed in!Back in the day, before Kenneth even graduated from the School of Medicine, he had offers from top universities abroad with full scholarships and job offers from prestigious hospitals.Everyone thought he would pick the best path for himself, but instead, he got married.And it didn't work out.""Kenneth, how could you..."" Marco was heartbroken. The old man, his hands all wrinkly with age, grabbed Kenneth's arm. ""If you're unhappy, you should change your path. Do you have any idea how many people are waiting for you to get back to the operating table?""Kenneth was the only medical student who could join top surgeons in the operating room before even fully graduating. His surgical skills were amazing—accurate, precise, and flawless. No one in the industry could find fault with him.He smiled and gently patted Marco's hand. ""I'm getting a divorce soon. I came today to ask you to let me be a student again. I'll handle all the paperwork in no time.""Marco's eyes lit up.""Really?""""Yeah."" Kenneth felt a sense of relief. ""Five years is enough. From now on, we'll go our separate ways. I'll sign the divorce papers tonight. About that study-abroad spot at the School of Medicine in Ancerora you mentioned before the New Year, is there still a chance for me?""""Yes, of course."" Marco quickly rummaged through his things and found the application form Kenneth had left behind. ""Look, I've signed it. Just need your signature.""It was clear that he still had Kenneth in mind.Kenneth got out of the office when his phone rang. He pulled it out and saw it was Adeline.He couldn't remember the last time they talked. When he called to see if she was home for dinner, it was always her secretary who picked up.""Where are you?"" There was a shuffling sound, like she was taking off her coat.After a pause, he said, ""The school. My mentor wants to talk to me.""Adeline frowned. ""You've been out of school for so long. What's there to talk about? Come home now.""""Okay."" Kenneth's voice was steady as always, and Adeline didn't pick up on anything unusual. But deep down, he was kind of hoping for something.His suitcase was ready in the living room, waiting for Adeline to see it.Kenneth opened the door with his fingerprint, and the house was quiet. He glanced at the suitcase in the corner of the sofa. It was still there, untouched.What was he even waiting for?""Okay, I'm coming right now. Don't worry.""Adeline's hair was still damp from a shower, and she looked pretty anxious. Normally, Kenneth would tell her to dry her hair before going out, or even do it for her if she was too bothered.But today, he just took out the divorce papers.He was still standing at the door, not even having time to change his shoes.He knew without a doubt it was Brennen on the phone.Adeline hung up and called her secretary. ""Go pick up Brennen and his daughter Janessa. Janessa has a fever. Take them to the hospital. I'm heading over.""She walked right up to Kenneth, but it was like she didn't see him at all and went straight past him.Kenneth couldn't take it anymore and directly handed her the divorce papers. ""Sign it.""Adeline finally looked up at him, her eyes narrowing. ""You... Janessa is sick. I gotta go check on her.""""Yeah, it's cool."" Kenneth nodded. ""Once we're divorced, you'll be free to take care of Mr. Everett and his kid.""""Come on, I'm in a hurry,"" Adeline said, holding her phone in one hand and slipping on her coat with the other. Seeing that Kenneth still hadn't moved, she got annoyed and yanked the pen and papers from his hand, signing her name quickly.She looked impatient. ""You're only excited when it's about money.""Kenneth was shocked. He didn't look up until the papers were taken back.""Adeline, do you even know what you're signing?""""Isn't it an adoption agreement?"" Adeline replied, sounding grumpy. ""We never had kids, and my mom has been pushing us to adopt for a while now. Let's get it over with. And let me tell you, I don't have time for this.""Adoption?It did sound familiar, but Kenneth felt that given their relationship, a kid in their home wouldn't be happy, so he refused.Adeline's phone rang like crazy. For a second, Kenneth wanted to grab it from her and chuck it out the window. He wanted to yell at her, ""You don't care about me at all! Weren't you the one who said we'd be happy together?!""They had been happy once.It was about a year after they got married. Brennen had settled down abroad, and Adeline realized there was no hope left, so she decided to try to make a good life with Kenneth.Those were rare happy days for Kenneth. He went to class during the day and cooked when he got home at night. The same hands that performed life-or-death surgeries were now cooking for Adeline.""Did Brennen treat you well?"" Kenneth suddenly asked. ""I mean, back then.""Adeline didn't stop. She glanced back at him from the doorway, her eyes cold and menacing. ""Don't make trouble for no reason.""""Adeline, I...""Before he could finish, the door slammed shut. He stood there for a few seconds and then let out a bitter laugh. What was he even expecting?He knew very well how obsessed Adeline was with Brennen.So, what was the point of talking?Anyway, he already had the divorce papers in hand.He clenched the papers, walked over to the sofa, and grabbed the suitcase that had been sitting there for a day. He took one last look around the house where he had lived for five years. Even though he had never felt truly at home here, he still felt that wherever he and Adeline were together was a home, especially after his mom passed away.He was curious when Adeline would notice he was gone.The one she didn't love left, and the one she loved moved right in.Would it be Brennen?Chapter 3 One Last ChanceKenneth got to the hotel, unpacked his stuff, and fell into bed, sleeping like a log.The thick curtains kept out the sunset, and he woke up naturally when it got dark. When he opened his eyes and saw the unfamiliar room, he felt a bit off for a moment.He got up, took a quick shower, and turned on his laptop to deal with his study abroad stuff. Marco had sent him the email of a mentor in Ancerora and told him to reach out early.He knew some basic Anceroran language, but he'd need to study it properly to live there.So, he used the money on his card to sign up for a language class and checked his bank balance.He hadn't taken any money from Carolina or Adeline. The only money in his bank account was from his old scholarship. His mom's medical bills in her later years were all paid by the Hatfield family, and he still had a bit of his scholarship left.He knew he'd have to pay them back someday, so he needed to figure out how to make some money.Kenneth opened his blog, which he hadn't looked at in ages. There were a few essays he had posted. Back in school, everyone knew he could really write. Lots of classmates even asked him to pen love letters on their behalf. He also used to write blogs. Even after charging from the second post, many people still paid to read.He was surprised to find a decent amount of money in the blog's backend. He withdrew it all.After searching around for a while, he finally found his phone under the bed. It must have fallen there when he fell asleep. He pressed a few buttons, but the screen didn't light up.He found the charger and turned the phone on.The moment it reconnected, a flood of messages and missed calls popped up. He thought it might be Marco reaching out about his study abroad plans, but when he opened it, he saw it was from Adeline.Adeline: ""Janessa has a fever and wants some oatmeal. Can you make some?""""Where are you? Why aren't you home?""""Where did you put the oatmeal? What has gotten into you? Janessa is sick, and you're still acting out? Get home now!""\*\*\*Kenneth read the messages for a few seconds and thought it was ridiculous. Janessa was Brennen's daughter, not his. Why should he be worried?Besides, the house belonged to Adeline. It was her home. After living there for five years, she didn't even know where the oatmeal was kept. How absurd.Since he had decided to divorce her, it was better not to get involved too much. So, he didn't reply.But Adeline wasn't going to let him go.Just as he was about to put down his phone, it rang. When he answered, Adeline's sister, Brielle Hatfield, started scolding him.""Why are you so heartless? Janessa is sick, and you don't care. Adeline told you to come back and cook! The whole family is waiting for you!""Kenneth frowned. ""Who's waiting for me?""""Adeline, Brennen, Janessa, and me. We're all waiting. Hurry up and come back. Janessa wants braised beef. The ones from outside aren't healthy. You need to make it.""What a pushy tone! Kenneth was so ticked off that he almost laughed.He sat up straight. ""First, Janessa isn't my kid, so I don't have to take care of her. Second, if you guys want to wait, go ahead, but I'm not going back. And lastly, speaking as a doctor, a sick kid shouldn't eat braised beef. It's hard to digest.""Brielle was taken aback. Could Kenneth talk this much in one go?""Is that Kenneth? Let me talk to him for a bit.""Brielle, looking annoyed, handed the phone to Brennen.""Hello, Kenneth. We haven't met yet, but I still want to apologize for coming to your place without your permission. Janessa is sick and being difficult. If you mind, I'll leave right now with her. We can't have you skipping out on family because of us.""This put Kenneth in a tough spot, making it seem like he was being unreasonable if he didn't go back.His mouth was dry, and he instinctively licked his lips. Over the years, he had gotten used to pleasing Adeline, and he wasn't naturally good at arguing. For a moment, he didn't know how to respond, but he knew he wasn't going back.""Mr. Everett, we haven't met because you were taken away when I saved Adeline back then. Anyway, it's not important, and we don't necessarily need to meet.""Brielle yelled, ""What do you mean it's his home?! This is my sister's house! She can invite whomever she wants! Who does he think he is to boss around?!""""Bree,"" Adeline, standing nearby, called out unhappily. ""Shut up.""Brielle still wouldn't back down. ""Am I wrong? You bought the house. What does he have to do with it? He's just a money-grabbing opportunist!""She had always been biased against Kenneth, and it got worse after he married Adeline. She liked Brennen and thought he had taken Brennen's place.Carolina had explained many times that Brennen was already married abroad, but she wouldn't listen.Kenneth didn't feel like putting up with Brielle's nonsense. ""Yeah, she's right. It's not my home.""With that, he hung up and turned his phone on silent.Brielle and Brennen stared at the phone, stunned.""Kenneth actually hung up on me! Does he even want to come back here?"" Brielle was fuming.Adeline, though, felt a bit scared. She didn't know why, but she felt like she had missed something important today.She had called Kenneth back in the afternoon, thinking she'd make up for forgetting his birthday and take him out for a meal. She didn't expect things to go so wrong.But after years of being in a high position, she had gotten spoiled. She couldn't bring herself to swallow her pride and make up with Kenneth.Kenneth's phone screen flickered with a new message.He picked it up and took a look.Adeline: ""Get your butt back here! If you don't get back now, I'm changing your fingerprint and password. You'll never get back in!""It was quite a harsh threat. Kenneth shook his head.They had signed the divorce papers. If she wanted to cut him off, let her.He texted back: ""Okay.""Adeline was so mad that she called him right away, but he didn't pick up.Kenneth's mood for writing his blog was totally ruined. He sat in front of his laptop, not moving for a long time. He couldn't figure out how his life had turned out this way.If he hadn't married Adeline back then, he might be a famous doctor now, showing off his skills and charm in the operating room.The room was pretty dark, with only the soft glow from the laptop screen lighting up Kenneth's face a little bit.He was good-looking. Ever since junior high, whenever he went to a new school, he'd have many girls after him.But he was all about his studies. He didn't want to waste his talent and never paid attention to anyone's crush on him until he met Adeline.She wasn't the prettiest girl he had ever seen, but her tears hit him right in the heart.They were hot.And they made him feel so bad that he couldn't say no.It was a vicious cycle. If he didn't get married, his mom wouldn't get treated and might die even sooner.He couldn't break free.Luckily, this cycle only lasted five years. He had reached the end and could start over.His love for Adeline had been destroyed day by day in despair. All that was left was regret.He regretted not being able to win Adeline's love and even felt a pang of jealousy towards Brennen.The phone lit up again.Adeline: ""I'm giving you one last chance. Where are you? I'll come get you.""Kenneth was confused. He thought, ""Why pick me up? To go back and watch her be all lovey-dovey with Brennen?""Chapter 4 ExplanationKenneth found it strange.Given Adeline's usual attitude, whenever Brennen was around, she'd completely ignore him.It was quite unusual that she had messaged him repeatedly today. In her mind, if he still wanted to salvage their marriage, he should take the hint and make an effort.But Kenneth no longer cared what she thought.So, he didn't reply to her message, put his phone on silent, and set it aside. He wasn't going back to that house, and he didn't mind if she deleted his fingerprint.He thought that was all she would do. If he didn't go back, she wouldn't mind. With Brennen around, he was the center of her attention.But in the middle of the night, the door suddenly opened.Kenneth, half-asleep, jolted awake, and the room light flicked on in an instant.Under the bright light, he saw Adeline's face, tinged with anger, at the doorway. For a second, he was so disoriented that he didn't know where he was.Even at home, they had been sleeping in separate rooms for a long time.Adeline often came home late, saying it was to avoid disturbing his sleep. But in reality, ever since Brennen came back, she had been staying faithful to him. Kenneth understood this and didn't care too much, letting her do as she wished.""What are you..."" He nervously pulled the blanket up a bit higher.Adeline curled her lips into a slight smile. The high-quality coat she wore made her figure look even more attractive. Her eyes still held anger and a hint of weariness, but they couldn't hide her beauty.Five years of marriage seemed to have only softened Kenneth, while Adeline remained unchanged.""Look at you, you've learned to run away from home now."" Adeline took off her coat and walked over to Kenneth. She stood by the bed, looking down at him. After a moment, she pinched his cheek.""After all these years at home, you've learned the tricks of crying, making a scene, and threatening suicide. Kenneth, are you serious or not?""Kenneth didn't expect Adeline to come over to yell at him.His eyes widened in shock, and he scrunched up his forehead, waving away Adeline's hand.Nobody likes being woken up in the middle of the night, especially with someone being so rude. Plus, the divorce was already happening, so he didn't need to humor Adeline anymore.""So, why did you come?"" Kenneth looked up at Adeline. ""What, did Mr. Everett leave?""When he said that, Adeline's expression changed a little, and he got it right away.""As soon as I left, Mr. Everett moved in. With him around, I don't know why you'd come here to look for trouble.""After five years of marriage, this was the first time Kenneth had spoken to Adeline in such a sarcastic tone. She was a bit surprised, but thinking that Brennen had moved into the house, it made sense that Kenneth would be upset. So, she tried to be patient and coax him a bit.""Why are you making such a fuss? I told you, Brennen and Janessa don't have a place to stay right now. We've got plenty of rooms in our house. They're not sleeping in the master bedroom, so they won't bother you.""""Adeline, you haven't forgotten that you signed the papers that day, have you?"" Kenneth asked tentatively.Adeline nodded. ""Of course not. I even agreed to adopt a kid. So why are you still angry? I asked you to go back and look after Janessa so you could get a feel for what it was like to take care of a kid. After all, we're gonna have a kid of our own.""Kenneth fell silent.So that was why Adeline had signed the papers so readily that day, without even looking at the details. She had thought the whole time that they were for adoption.Seeing her confident look, Kenneth couldn't help but sneer. To avoid any more trouble, he didn't remind her that the papers were actually for a divorce.""Let's go home."" Adeline tugged at the blanket.But Kenneth said, ""Go back by yourself. Brielle said it's your house and has nothing to do with me. I know when to stay out of the way. Besides, it's better for Mr. Everett to take care of his own kid. If Janessa gets hurt here, I can't afford that.""""Kenneth!"" Adeline's patience was gone, and she shouted.Kenneth raised an eyebrow and pointed to the next room. ""If you wanna shout, do it back home. You can yell at Mr. Everett and his kid all you want. But this is a hotel. It's not right to disturb other people's sleep.""It was past midnight. Adeline had come in with a chill and left with her anger. Kenneth let out a long breath and lay back down.The room fell back into darkness, and he stared at the ceiling.No wonder Adeline had signed so readily without even mocking him or reading the details. If he had known, he would have slipped in a few extra properties.Thinking of this, he couldn't help but chuckle. He didn't want anything from Adeline.After he left her, he could get back to a normal life. He was confident that with his abilities, he'd be fine.Kenneth thought he could smoothly go to Ancerora to get used to life there, but his passport had a last-minute issue.He sighed. If that was how things were meant to be, then he'd have to stay a few more days.In the president's office of the Hatfield Group.Adeline was staring out the window, lost in thought.Kenneth still refused to go home.Last night, since he didn't come back to cook, she had to order some takeout food for Janessa. By the time Brielle left, she had tracked down Kenneth's location and was about to go find him.Brennen chipped in, ""Mr. Guzman must be upset, right? How about I go with you?""""What about Janessa?""""She has taken her medicine and is asleep. She'll be fine. Let me go with you and explain things."" Brennen sounded sincere.""Mr. Guzman is overthinking it. We're just friends. Why is he still upset? He doesn't think I'm some homewrecker, does he?""To Adeline, these words felt a bit off.Brennen's attempt to keep her there seemed different somehow.Chapter 5 DramaAfter thinking it through, Adeline decided that it wasn't a good idea to bring Brennen along.""Never mind, I'll go by myself. Kenneth has a rather quirky personality and might say something that upsets you. Go get some sleep. You gotta take Janessa to the hospital for an IV tomorrow. Don't be late.""Without giving Brennen a chance to change her mind, Adeline grabbed her car keys and headed out.Brennen stood in the living room for a long time, then turned and looked around the entire room. Finally, he quietly pushed open the door to the bedroom that Adeline and Kenneth had shared.He could tell Adeline didn't like Kenneth at all.He had noticed right away that there were no men's toiletries in the bathroom, but Adeline hadn't seemed to notice.In a way, it was for the best. It saved a lot of trouble.Kenneth's passport had problems, and he ran around for days but still couldn't get it sorted, so he missed the first batch of exchange study opportunities. He was seething with anger, knowing Adeline was behind all this, trying to force him to show up.But for the sake of a smooth divorce, he kept quiet.The language class started, and Kenneth spent his days either in class or interning at the hospital.When Marco heard that he hadn't been able to go abroad as planned, he suggested waiting for the second batch of classes. In the meantime, a hospital that had been eyeing Kenneth for a while reached out. With Marco's help, he got a job for the first time in five years.He moved to a different hotel. But he knew that if Adeline wanted to find him, she could track him down no matter where he went.Kenneth was busy with work and classes this week. It was hectic but also fulfilling. He felt energetic and alive again.He had thought he wouldn't run into Brennen until the divorce was finalized, but then Brennen showed up at the hospital where he was interning, with Janessa in tow.""Are you Mr. Guzman?""Kenneth, fresh off the operating table in his white coat, was heading to his office when he heard the voice and turned his head.Brennen smiled at him. ""Nice to meet you, I'm Brennen Everett.""He had the same voice as over the phone, and he had the kind of looks Adeline would go for. No wonder she couldn't forget him after all these years.Kenneth looked around for Adeline but caught Brielle's annoyed stare instead.""What are you doing here? Did you follow us?"" Brielle snorted. She knew Kenneth wouldn't leave home like that. After all that drama, he was still chasing after Adeline.Kenneth looked away, nodded at Brennen, and walked off.Brennen, though, didn't seem willing to let him go just yet. He stepped forward and blocked his way.""Mr. Guzman, let's talk,"" he said with a fake smile that made Kenneth uncomfortable.What was there to talk about between him, some guy who just got back to the country and was like a crush from the past, and Kenneth, who had already divorced and wasn't exactly the favorite in his marriage?Kenneth frowned. ""I've got work to do.""Before Brennen could even respond, Brielle, who was standing nearby, impatiently cut in, ""Brennen is being nice to you. Don't be ungrateful!""The noise started to draw a crowd.If the security guards got involved, Kenneth's reputation would take a hit.He sighed, ""What do you wanna say?""Brennen smiled and didn't say a word. He pointed towards the fire escape.In there, the exit sign was hanging crookedly, and the floor under it was covered with cigarette butts.""Did you move out already?""Brennen nudged a cigarette butt with his toe, dragging a long black trail of ash on the ground.By saying ""move out,"" he was acting like he owned Adeline's place.Kenneth sneered, his gaze fixed on Brennen. ""You know everything. Why are you here to embarrass me?""Brennen kept quiet for a moment. He sucked in his cheeks, like he was thinking hard. Then he finally said, ""You're not trying to play hard to get, are you? I mean, pretending to be distant to make Adeline keep thinking about you.""Kenneth didn't think it would work out like this.No wonder Adeline had had Brennen on her mind all these years.Kenneth smiled bitterly. ""I'm gonna divorce Adeline soon. Honestly, I was supposed to be out of the country by now. If it weren't for...""He had made up his mind to leave. So why, deep down, did he still kinda hope that Adeline would stop him?She was swamped with work, and Brennen and Janessa had been around her these days.""What am I even thinking?"" Kenneth thought, shaking his head with a wry smile.""Yeah, right. Like you'd let go of someone like Adeline,"" Brennen said, like he had heard the most ridiculous thing ever, his voice full of disbelief.""So to you, Adeline is just someone you can take advantage of?""Guess her judgment isn't so great after all.""With that, Kenneth reached for the fire escape door and pushed it open, about to leave.Brennen let out a few sinister laughs, then suddenly pulled out a fruit knife from behind his back and slashed at his own arm.""Kenneth, you want a divorce, right? Let me help you.""Kenneth turned around to grab Brennen's hand, but it was too late.The sharp knife cut through Brennen's tailored suit, leaving a long, bloody gash on his upper left arm.Blood started dripping down.Brennen's face turned pale.Kenneth had never hated being a doctor as much as he did right then.He hurried towards the door, yelling, ""There's a patient! Get him to the surgery ward now!""Brielle was waiting outside the fire escape. She grabbed Kenneth when she heard him. ""What did you do?""Kenneth kept walking, but Brielle yanked his arm hard again. ""Tell me, what did you do?""He shook off her hand, annoyed. ""If you're worried about your sweetheart, get to the fire escape now.""He had been suspicious for a while. He always felt that Brielle was way too into Brennen.A spoiled girl like her actually tagged along with Brennen to the hospital. In a normal family, it might be a sister looking out for her brother-in-law, but this was Brielle, who always got whatever she wanted.She treated Brennen differently than she did other people.Her feelings for him were too plain to see.As expected, Brielle's eyes widened as if she had been caught in a lie, and she stared at Kenneth.After a few seconds, she seemed to wake up from it and sprinted towards the fire escape.Adeline got to the hospital pretty fast, like she ditched everything at work the second she got Brielle's call.Brennen's cut wasn't that bad. Even if he tried to hurt himself, his body wouldn't let him do too much damage. He just nicked a blood vessel.But that was enough to tick off Adeline.So when she burst into the office, fuming mad, Kenneth wasn't the least bit surprised.""Did you cut Brennen with a knife?""Kenneth gave a bitter laugh. ""Is that what you think I am?""Adeline snapped back, ""Isn't it? You've been jealous of him this whole time.""To her, Kenneth did all these things lately because he was jealous of Brennen.""He cut himself.""""Do you really expect me to believe that? Is Brennen nuts? Would he hurt himself to frame you? Do you even deserve that?""The last few words left Kenneth breathless. He looked at Adeline, stubborn and sincere. ""He's trying to set me up. Adeline, why can't you believe me this one time?""Just this once.If Adeline believed him, then these five years wouldn't feel like they were for nothing.But every time he hoped for something from Adeline, it seemed to fall through.""Hope he's okay,"" Adeline said, then turned and left the office.Her high heels clicked sharply against the floor.Kenneth slumped down into his chair, feeling drained.She didn't even close the door for him.In the treatment room, Adeline grabbed a chair and sat next to Brennen.The cut was long but not very deep.Brennen looked pale. ""Adeline, did I do something to make Mr. Guzman mad?""Adeline shook her head. She couldn't stop thinking about the look on Kenneth's face.From what she knew about him, he didn't seem like the type to do something like that.Maybe she did get it wrong.Brennen didn't get the answer he wanted and went on, ""If I'm in the way here, I can take Janessa and stay in a hotel.""Janessa was still running a fever.With all the fuss Kenneth had been making these past few days, the poor kid couldn't even rest and get better.Today's mess was too much.Adeline thought maybe she had been too soft on Kenneth before.She said, ""No, you stay here. You didn't do anything wrong. Kenneth hurt you. I'll make sure he apologizes to you in person.""Brennen nodded, and a faint smile flickered at the corner of his mouth.Just then, Brielle barged in. ""Adeline, you're finally here!""Kenneth actually dared to hurt Brennen! Aren't you gonna do something about it?""But once his passport is ready, he'll be gone for good!""Hearing this, Adeline abruptly stood up and demanded, ""Where's he going?""Brielle was startled, blinking her eyes in confusion. ""He's going abroad. Didn't you know?""",1,1748670885.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1kzpvvx,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1kzpvvx/25m_i_want_to_get_to_know_my_coworker_25m_better/,[25M] I want to get to know my coworker [25M] better – friendship or maybe something more?,"Hi everyone,

I (25M, quiet and sensitive) have been working with a coworker who is around my age for about 3–4 years now. We joined the company at the same time and have always worked well together – professionally and with mutual trust – but our relationship has stayed purely work-related and formal.

Lately, though, I’ve started to feel a desire to get to know him outside of work too – mainly because I can really imagine becoming friends with him. I’m not looking for a relationship, at least not primarily – I’m open to it if something were to develop naturally in the future, but that’s not the goal. What I truly want is a real, honest friendship.

What draws me to him is not just how well we work together, but also how he reacts to certain situations. For example, when others tease him playfully, he tends to go very quiet – it comes across as sensitive to me, like there’s a side of him people don’t really see. That’s what makes him interesting to me as a person.

We recently followed each other on Instagram – he followed back right away. Since then, I’ve noticed that he suddenly started using emojis in our Teams chats – something he never did before. That might seem minor or irrelevant to others, but I tend to notice and feel small shifts like that quite deeply.

From what I’ve gathered about him: he’s into soccer, likes to party, travels a lot, and seems to enjoy video games. But personally, we’ve never talked about anything outside of work – it’s always remained purely professional.

Earlier this week, I tried to casually ask him out for coffee, but it didn’t work out due to work stuff. Some friends of mine suggest I should just send him a lighthearted message on Instagram – maybe a funny meme as an opener. Others think I should talk to him directly at the office and ask if he wants to grab lunch sometime. And then there are more cautious voices – some people mention that he might have a girlfriend, based on office gossip.

One thing that keeps me thinking: since we followed each other on Instagram, he seems a bit different – subtle but noticeable. He uses emojis in chats now, and he’s also slightly more helpful and responsive than he used to be. Maybe it’s nothing – but as someone who’s pretty sensitive, I tend to notice even small changes.

A close friend of mine, who’s also gay, advised me to be direct before I overthink and get stuck in speculation. He went through something similar once and now says he regrets not recognizing the signs or making a move. He also said: “Just because someone has a girlfriend doesn’t mean he’s fully figured out his own orientation – sometimes people are just under social pressure.”

But I don’t want to assume anything or build up expectations. I just want to find out – in an honest, respectful way – whether I could get to know him better as a person, after all these years of working side by side. If it turns into something more someday, fine – but what I really want is a genuine personal connection.

I’m not someone with a big friend group. I have maybe 2–5 close friends – some I’ve known for over a decade, others I met through gaming or social media. I struggle to make new connections, but I deeply crave real, meaningful relationships – especially in everyday life.

⸻

My questions for you: 
• How would you approach someone you’ve only had a professional relationship with so far? 
• Would it be okay to casually message him on Instagram (e.g., start with a meme or something like: “Hey, random question – do you game? I think I overheard you mention something in the office once… or was that [Colleague X]? 😅”)? 
•  Or would it be better to ask him in person at the office to grab lunch, without making it too heavy? 
• How do you personally deal with uncertainty when trying to connect with someone – especially if you’re more reserved? 
• And how do you even tell if someone likes you in a friendly (or possibly more) way? 
• One last thing: I often feel like he waits for me to make the first move before he responds. Why might that be?

This enables⁤ blazing-fast data transfer speeds​ of up to ⁤40Gbps,​ making ⁣it ideal for transferring large‌ files, editing high-resolution videos, or connecting multiple‍ high-bandwidth devices simultaneously. Moreover, ⁤it allows for daisy-chaining of Thunderbolt devices,⁤ simplifying your setup and‌ reducing cable clutter. Proper ‌adapters take‍ full ⁣advantage of the bandwidth available on Apple Silicon Macs.

**Wide Range of Ports:**

A⁣ versatile USB adapter should offer a variety of ports to ​accommodate diffrent device‌ types. Look for adapters ​that include USB-A ports (USB⁣ 3.0 or higher for fast data transfer), USB-C‌ ports (for newer devices and charging), HDMI ports (for connecting to external displays), Ethernet ports (for stable wired internet connections), ‌and ​SD/MicroSD card readers (for photographers and videographers). The best ones even add audio⁤ jacks⁤ (3.5mm) for versatility.

**Power Delivery (PD)‍ Support:**

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a 20 ft shipping container home can be an exciting and rewarding project. With innovative ideas and practical tips, you can transform a humble shipping container into a cozy living space. Whether you are a seasoned DIYer or just starting, there are endless possibilities to make every square foot count. Below, discover some creative concepts to help you bring your vision to life.

### Maximizing Space Efficiently

Efficient use of space is crucial in a 20 ft shipping container home. Here are several strategies to make the most of your limited square footage:

- **Multi-functional furniture:** Use furniture that serves more than one purpose. For example, a sofa bed provides seating during the day and transforms into a sleeping space at night.
- **Vertical storage:** Make use of wall space by installing shelves. This keeps the floor clear and maximizes usable areas for showcasing decor or storing items.
- **Open floor plan:** Avoid unnecessary walls. An open layout creates an illusion of more space and allows easy movement.
 
### Choosing the Right Layout

The layout of your shipping container home significantly impacts functionality and comfort. Consider these layout ideas:

- **Living area:** Position your living space at the entrance to create a welcoming environment. This area can benefit from ample natural light, so consider large windows or slide-out doors.
- **Kitchen:** A compact kitchen design with essential appliances can save space. Place the sink and stovetop side by side and use creative storage solutions, like hanging pots and pans.
- **Bathroom:** In a container home, it’s common to have a small bathroom. Opt for a corner shower to maximize available space and use light colors to make the area feel bigger.
 
### Natural Light

Natural light can transform a small space. Here are some effective ways to incorporate it:

- **Large windows:** Install floor-to-ceiling windows to create a sense of openness. Consider using double-glazed windows for better insulation.
- **Skylights:** Skylights are an excellent addition to bring in natural light, especially in spaces that may not have enough wall space for windows.
- **Glass doors:** If your design allows, replace a solid wall with sliding glass doors that open to a patio or deck.
 
### Emphasizing Sustainability

A 20 ft shipping container home can also be eco-friendly. Here are some practical ways to make your home green:

- **Insulation:** Proper insulation helps maintain temperature. Consider using recycled materials for insulation, such as cellulose or sheep's wool.
- **Solar panels:** Installing solar panels can reduce energy costs and your carbon footprint. They can provide the primary energy source for heating, lighting, and appliances.
- **Water collection systems:** Use a rainwater harvesting system to collect rainwater for irrigation or non-potable uses in your home.
 
### Creating an Outdoor Space

Don’t forget about the outdoor area! Your shipping container home should have a seamless connection to the outdoors. Here are some ideas:

- **Decking:** Build a deck that extends from your living area for relaxation and entertainment. It’s perfect for enjoying coffee in the morning or hosting evening gatherings.
- **Garden:** Whether it’s flowers, vegetables, or herb garden, creative landscaping can beautify the area around your container, making it feel more like home.
- **Seating area:** Add outdoor furniture to create a cozy spot for reading, dining, or socializing. Use weather-resistant materials for durability.
 
Your 20 ft shipping container home can blend functionality, sustainability, and style. By carefully planning your layout and incorporating creative design elements, you can create a tiny home with a big impact. Embrace the journey, explore your options, and enjoy your unique living space!

The Environmental Impact of Tiny Homes: How a 20 Ft Shipping Container Makes a Difference
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In recent years, tiny homes have surged in popularity, and one of the most innovative solutions in this movement is the 20 ft shipping container home. These compact living spaces not only serve as affordable housing options but also bring significant environmental benefits. Adopting a smaller footprint can lead to a huge positive impact on the planet, particularly through sustainable practices and reduced waste.

One of the most significant advantages of using a 20 ft shipping container as a home is the recycling aspect. Shipping containers are often discarded after their initial use, leading to an abundance of steel structures that could be repurposed. By converting these containers into living spaces, you're not only giving them a new life but also reducing the need for new building materials. This practice lowers the carbon footprint associated with construction, as the production of new materials often contributes to greenhouse gas emissions.

Choosing a tiny home, particularly a shipping container home, also encourages a minimalist lifestyle. With limited space, residents must prioritize their belongings and live with less. This mindset not only connects you to your possessions but also fosters a more sustainable approach to consumption. By reducing clutter and focusing on what truly matters, you contribute to a culture that values simplicity and reduces waste.

The energy efficiency of a 20 ft shipping container home further enhances its environmental performance. These homes can be designed with sustainability in mind, incorporating features such as:

- **Solar panels:** Utilizing solar energy can significantly reduce reliance on fossil fuels.
- **Energy-efficient appliances:** Choosing ENERGY STAR certified appliances conserves energy and reduces utility bills.
- **Proper insulation:** Well-insulated homes maintain temperature more effectively, lowering heating and cooling needs.
- **Rainwater harvesting systems:** This setup allows you to collect and reuse water, which supports conservation efforts.

Moreover, the small size of a shipping container home naturally limits the amount of energy consumed. Smaller living spaces require less heating and cooling, leading to reduced energy bills and less environmental impact. By emphasizing efficiency, you contribute to a sustainable lifestyle without compromising comfort.

Another way in which a 20 ft shipping container home makes a difference is through their potential for greater land efficiency. Tiny homes can be situated in urban infill areas or on smaller lots, allowing for more dense housing options. This approach helps reduce urban sprawl and preserves natural landscapes. Living in a well-designed tiny home allows you to enjoy the benefits of urban living while minimizing the ecological footprint associated with larger homes and suburban development.

Accessories like community gardens and shared spaces can often accompany these homes, promoting a sense of community and shared responsibility towards the environment. Living in close quarters fosters relationships with neighbors, encouraging communal efforts in sustainability. Gardens not only produce food but also improve air quality and support local wildlife.

The adaptability of shipping container homes is another remarkable feature. They can be modified to fit various locations and climates, making them an appealing choice for eco-friendly living. From homes in urban settings to off-grid retreats, these containers can be tailored to fit your needs while maintaining a commitment to sustainability.

Understanding the environmental benefits of tiny homes, particularly 20 ft shipping container homes, fosters a growing movement leaders are taking note of worldwide. Not only do they present smart living solutions, but they also align with global goals to combat climate change and promote sustainable living practices. Whether you're interested in reducing your own ecological footprint or looking for innovative housing solutions, shipping container homes serve as a vital tool in addressing environmental challenges.

Ultimately, opting for a 20 ft shipping container home can significantly contribute to a greener future. With their emphasis on recycling, energy efficiency, and sustainable living, these homes not only provide essential housing solutions but also inspire a shift towards a more environmentally conscious society. By making intentional choices about where we live and how we use resources, we can all make a big impact, one tiny home at a time.

### Conclusion

Creating a 20 Ft shipping container home embodies both creativity and sustainability. As you design your tiny living space, consider integrating innovative solutions that maximize functionality without sacrificing comfort. From versatile furniture design to energy-efficient appliances, every detail can enhance your lifestyle while maintaining a minimal footprint.

Embracing a shipping container home not only fulfills the dream of affordable housing but also contributes positively to the environment. By repurposing shipping containers, you’re participating in a clever recycling process that reduces waste and lessens the demand for traditional building materials. This eco-friendly choice minimizes your carbon footprint and aligns with a more sustainable way of living.

With society increasingly shifting toward more eco-conscious lifestyles, the 20 Ft shipping container home stands out as a practical solution for individuals looking to make a big impact in a small space. It invites creativity, promotes sustainable living, and offers an affordable pathway to homeownership that resonates with those seeking freedom from traditional housing constraints.

Embracing this unique approach to home design not only transforms your living environment but also inspires others to consider the benefits of tiny homes. A 20 Ft shipping container can serve as a model for a sustainable lifestyle that prioritizes simplicity, efficiency, and ingenuity. Ultimately, whether you’re considering a tiny home for yourself or simply exploring the possibilities, the journey toward minimalist living in a 20 Ft shipping container opens up a world of opportunity while honoring our planet.",1,1748670160.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

Me, a perpetual bookworm in my third year of computer science, was sitting at my usual table by the window where the Wi-Fi signal was strongest. That day, I was rereading my notes for the hundredth time before an exam when she walked in—tall, with chestnut hair cascading to her shoulders, wearing an oversized sweater that was clearly a size too big. She was carrying a stack of clinical psychology books and accidentally bumped into my coffee cup.  

""Oh my God, I'm so sorry!"" Her voice trembled as if she were about to cry, even though not a drop had spilled.  

""It's fine,"" I smiled.  

She introduced herself—Sarah. We started talking, and it turned out she was studying psychology, dreamed of working with children, loved old movies, and, just like me, despised avocado (which felt like fate). We talked until the library closed, and then she suggested going to a café around the corner—the one with blue chairs and perpetually burnt croissants.  

That’s how our relationship began.  

The first two years were perfect. She knew how to calm me down before exams, remembered that I liked double olives on my pizza, and always laughed at my stupid programmer jokes. We rented a tiny apartment overlooking the park where they sold waffles with strawberry jam on Sundays. I thought I’d found the person I wanted to spend the rest of my life with.  

When I proposed, she burst into tears and said ""yes"" so quickly, as if afraid I’d change my mind. The wedding was small—just close friends and family. Her mother, a stern woman with an ever-present string of pearls around her neck, seemed a little tense, but I chalked it up to nerves.  

And then the strangeness began.  

At first, it was little things. Like her phone. She used to leave it lying around, but suddenly, she started carrying it everywhere—even into the shower. One evening, as she was cooking dinner, a message popped up on the screen: *""Don’t forget about tomorrow. LOVE YOU ❤️ - M.""*  

""Who’s that?"" I asked.  

""Oh, it’s just Mike, my coworker,"" she laughed, but her fingers clenched the phone so tightly her knuckles turned white. ""He signs all his messages like that—just being silly.""  

I wanted to believe her. But something clicked in my head.  

Then came the strange expenses. Sarah had always been frugal, but suddenly, she started buying expensive gifts ""for her mom""—jewelry, a designer handbag. Once, I accidentally saw a receipt—it had a man’s name on it. *Michael R.*  

""It’s a mistake,"" she said when I showed her the receipt. ""The cashier must’ve mixed it up.""  

But the doubts kept growing.  

I began noticing other things. Like how every other Saturday, she’d ""visit a friend in the next town over."" I offered to drive her, but she refused: ""Don’t bother, I’ll take a taxi."" One day, I secretly checked her ride history—the taxi had been booked to a neighborhood where her ""friend"" supposedly lived, but in reality, it was an upscale residential complex.  

Then, one terrible evening, when she left for her ""friend’s place"" again, I couldn’t take it anymore. I got in my car and followed the route I’d memorized from her trip history.  

What I saw shattered my heart.  

She was walking out of the building with a man—tall, wearing glasses, carrying the very same bag she’d supposedly bought ""for her mom."" And beside them was a little girl—about five years old, with the same chestnut hair as Sarah’s.  

I sat in the car, and the world around me collapsed.  

Later, after hiring a private investigator, I learned the whole truth.  

Michael was her real husband. They’d married a year before we even met. The little girl was their daughter. And me? I was the ""backup.""  

Turns out, Sarah had been living a double life. With me—when Michael was away on ""business trips"" (which, by the way, were often just days spent... with me). The money I thought we were saving for our future went toward their mortgage. Even our ""beloved"" anniversary trip to Paris... was a redo of their honeymoon.  

And the worst part? Her mother knew.  

When I confronted her, shaking with rage, she coldly said:  

""You have to understand—Sarah was just... afraid of being alone.""  

Now I’m sitting in our (well, her) apartment, drinking cheap whiskey and wondering: How could I have missed it? Why didn’t I check sooner?  

And most importantly: What do I do now?",0,1748669956.0,stories,1,0.5,False

Já achei em Brasília e na gringa. Existe algo assim em SP?","Desde que provei alguns cafés lavados, de torra clara, africanos e colombianos de torrefações gringas (Sey, La Cabra etc.), fiquei apaixonado por cafés de perfil brilhante, mais ácidos, suculentos, com menos corpo, aromas florais e frescos - quase como chá.

No Brasil, o único lugar onde encontrei algo nesse estilo foi no Acervo (torrefação e cafeteria excepcional, de Brasília). 

Se em Brasília já existe essa experiência, espera-se que São Paulo teria pelo menos uma porção de opções equivalentes… mas, até agora, nenhum café que visitei em SP chegou perto. Para mim, o Acervo está anos-luz à frente de qualquer outro café que já provei no Brasil.

**É possível encontrar cafés assim em São Paulo?**

*Abaixo, compartilho as melhores experiências que tive em São Paulo e que poderiam se aproximar desse estilo :*

- Coffee Lab: Meu favorito há mais de 10 anos. Gosto da complexidade e elegância dos grãos e da preferência da casa pelo Espírito Santo (região favorita da Raposeiras e minha também). Ainda assim, sinto que tudo vai muito pro caramelo e doce, encobrindo a acidez, o frescor, as notas florais/frutadas e a sensação de estar tomando um chá que procuro.

- Pato Rei: Visitei recentemente. Achei promissor à primeira vista, mas o foco da casa está nos fermentados (que não me agradam tanto). Provei dois coados: um ótimo (dark honey), outro péssimo (fermentado). Atualmente, oferecem 3 cafés gringos ultra premium por R$147 a xícara (!), mas apenas para consumir lá. O barista chegou a dizer que “detestam cafés lavados”, então talvez não seja o lugar certo pra mim 😂

- Sensory Café: visitei recentemente. Tomei apenas um Geisha anunciado como floral, mas o perfil puxava para especiarias (cardamomo, pimenta rosa etc). As outras opções disponíveis não chamaram atenção. Talvez mereça uma segunda chance?

- Um Coffee: muitas opções de grãos, alguns bem interessantes, mas nunca encontrei lá o perfil que procuro.

- Fora da Lei : Visitei 2 vezes no ano passado. Boa impressão geral e ponto positivo por ter grãos africanos (pelo menos tinha quando fui), o que é raro no Brasil. Pode ser uma boa opção, mas ainda não encontrei lá nada que me deixasse empolgado como o Acervo. Alguém conhece melhor? Devo testar mais vezes?

- EAP Café: Nova cafeteria do dono do Empório Alto de Pinheiros (bar de cervejas artesanais que frequento há 10+ anos). É o único lugar em SP onde vi mais de uma opção de cafés gringos e a carta de grãos é a maior que já vi por aqui. Mesmo assim, o que provei ainda não me impactou como os do Acervo. Preciso visitar mais vezes.

*Cafeterias que ainda quero conhecer:*
- Joana Cafés (indicação do u/paulo-urbonas aqui no sub)
- Por Um Punhado de Dólares
- Bogo Café
- Little Coffee Shop
- Catarina Coffee
- Koa Cafés
- Over Coffee Roasters

Se você também busca cafés brilhantes, lavados, florais e com torra clara, ou conhece lugares que entregam essa experiência em São Paulo, adoraria saber.

This guide helps you discover the best 5x7 rugs available⁤ at T.J.

##​ Key Features ⁣Analysis

Scouring the aisles of T.J. Maxx ⁣or⁣ browsing their online selection can be overwhelming. To help you make an ⁣informed ⁢decision, let's delve‍ into the key ‌features​ to look for in‌ a 5x7 rug.

**Material Composition:**​ Understanding the rug's material is​ crucial for ⁣determining its durability,maintenance,and overall feel.

Most T.J. Maxx rugs are made from synthetic materials ⁢like polypropylene, polyester, or ⁢a blend of⁣ both. Natural fibers‌ like wool,cotton,and jute are⁤ also ‌sometimes⁤ available,though usually at a higher ⁤price point. Consider your lifestyle and traffic levels; synthetic fibers are⁤ generally stain-resistant and easier to clean, while natural fibers offer a more luxurious ⁢feel‍ and can be more durable long-term‌ if properly​ cared for.

**Pile Height:** the rug's pile height affects its comfort,⁢ appearance, and ⁢practicality.

A low pile (less then ⁤0.5 inches) is ideal for high-traffic areas,as it's easier ⁤to clean and less likely to trap dirt. Medium pile (0.5 to 1 inch) ⁤offers‍ a good balance of comfort and durability. High⁢ pile⁢ or shag rugs (over‌ 1 inch)‍ are ‍the softest and most luxurious⁤ but can be ‍more challenging​ to clean and maintain.**Construction Type:**⁣ How the rug is made impacts its durability​ and appearance.

Common construction types include machine-made,hand-tufted,and hand-knotted. Machine-made rugs ⁣are​ the most affordable and readily available at‌ T.J.⁢ Maxx. Hand-tufted rugs offer a ‌higher level of craftsmanship, while hand-knotted rugs are ‍the most expensive and durable option, though​ less ​commonly found at T.J.Maxx. Check ‍the⁢ rug label for‍ construction details.

**Pattern and Design:** The rug's‍ pattern and design‍ should‌ complement your existing decor.

T.J. Maxx⁣ offers a ⁤wide ⁣variety of styles, from traditional Persian and bohemian to⁢ modern geometric⁣ and abstract⁢ designs. Consider ‍the colors, ‌patterns, and overall aesthetic ‍of your room when selecting a rug. A bold‌ pattern ⁤can add personality to ​a neutral⁣ space, ⁢while⁢ a subtle ‍design can create a more​ calming​ atmosphere.

**Backing ⁣Material:**‍ The backing⁣ material ⁢affects the rug's stability and can prevent slippage.

Look for rugs with a sturdy backing made of jute, cotton, or a synthetic material. A rug pad is ‍highly recommended, regardless of the backing, to⁢ provide extra cushioning, prevent the​ rug ‍from slipping, and protect your flooring.

Key features to ‍consider:

*‌ Material Composition (Synthetic vs. Natural)
* Pile Height (Low, Medium, high)
* Construction‌ Type (Machine-made, Hand-tufted)
* Pattern and Design⁤ (Traditional, ⁤Modern, Bohemian)
* Backing ⁤Material (Jute,⁢ Cotton, ⁤Synthetic)

This is especially vital in high-traffic ⁤areas like hallways ‌and living​ rooms. By placing a rug under furniture, you can also ⁣prevent it from scratching or marking‌ your floors.

**Noise Reduction:** Rugs ‍absorb sound, reducing echoes and ‌noise ​levels in your home. This is​ notably beneficial⁤ in apartments‍ or‍ homes with hard floors.The thicker the rug and ⁢the ⁢higher the ‍pile, the more effective ​it will be‍ at‌ dampening sound.

**Defining⁢ Spaces:** Use ⁣a ⁣5x7 rug to visually define⁢ different areas within a larger room.

Guadalupe’s husband said.She didn’t fight it—her heart had shattered long ago.She signed the papers and walked away.But love? That was something she’d never believe in again.Until another man saw her worth, breaking into her guarded heart.""You have no idea—she’s full of surprises.""Her ex scoffed. ""My ex-wife? Impossible. She was a disaster.""The man let out a cold smile. ""The real disaster is you. She’s mine now.""Chapter 1 He SignedDesmond Harrison was cheating on her.Guadalupe Melton stood outside the CEO's office, frozen in place, still reeling from the dirty secret she had just uncovered.Her black high heels seemed to blend into the black-veined marble floor.After what felt like an eternity, she knocked on the door.""Come in."" A deep male voice rang out.Clutching the files, Guadalupe opened the door with her other hand and forced a smile.She strolled over to his side and asked, ""Are you busy? I got a few files needing your signature right away.""Though she asked so, she had placed the files in front of him and even flipped to the pages where he needed to sign.Desmond had just gotten back from a business trip to Thuoria that morning.Right after he got off the plane, he headed to the office. There was a stack of files on his desk, fatigue etched on his face. So he signed without even looking at the files Guadalupe handed him.""Thanks,"" Guadalupe said.Then she put away the files he had signed and asked as usual, despite knowing his answer, ""Are you coming home for dinner tonight?""""I've got something to do. Don't wait up,"" he answered without looking up.""Alright. I'll get out of your hair now.""She nodded and turned around, her smile turning into a sneer.As she walked by the attached lounge in the office, she heard faint sounds from inside, like a kitten or a puppy jumping off the bed.Her gaze flicked to the coffee table, only to see several packs of snacks and a half-empty cup of hot chocolate. And there was a toppled pink high heel on the floor...She realized something instantly, her heart sinking to the bottom.Then she came back to her office.It felt as if the way back to her office had exhausted her. As she sat down, she let out a sigh.Then she pulled out a file from those Desmond had just signed—a divorce agreement.She flipped to the last page, her fingers tracing over his signature as a bitter smile tugged at her lips. Meanwhile, memories flooded her mind...Back then, when Desmond said he wanted to marry her, he looked so firm and affectionate. Desmond's mom Elyse Garza, however, scoffed and told her not to get carried away, as no man would stick to one woman forever. Guadalupe insisted that Desmond was different.But she was terribly wrong.He thought he hid his affair well, enjoying the thrill of it all. In fact, he took his mistress together with him on this business trip.He even brought her back here.Guadalupe withdrew her finger, took a photo of Desmond's signature on the divorce agreement, and sent it to Elyse with two words, ""He signed.""One week ago, they had struck a deal.Elyse asked her to initiate the divorce and not to tell the others about her secret marriage with Desmond, and she requested 150 million dollars from Elyse as compensation.A month later, Desmond would be a total stranger to her.A knocking snapped Guadalupe back to reality.She put away the divorce agreement and said, ""Come in.""It was Desmond's assistant, Harold Osborne.""Ms. Melton, Mr. Harrison asked me to give you this."" Harold placed a dark green velvet box in front of her.She opened it and saw a set of expensive diamond jewelry inside. Instantly, a photo flashed across her mind. A short-haired girl in a bathrobe had a diamond necklace in her hand, her eyes hazy. Behind her, the light was dim, and the bed was messy. Her chest was covered with hickeys, indicating wild sex.Guadalupe felt sick.""Thanks, Harold.""She looked up at him, her gaze as sharp as a blade.Harold couldn't help but shiver.""Mr. Harrison picked them for you. It's unique,"" he instinctively added.Too bad Desmond's heart wasn't as exclusive.And she didn't want a cheater.She smiled, ""Oh, is that so? How touching. He managed to buy me a gift when he's so swamped?""Harold thought, ""Something is off. Could it be that she has already known about Mr. Harrison and Ms. Graham...""He broke out in a cold sweat and strode out of her office.Guadalupe looked at the jewelry on her desk with disdain, like it had germs on it. Then she took out her phone, took a photo of them, and sent it to a second-hand luxury dealer.She texted him, ""Sell this set of jewelry for me. And donate the money to FCIDD.""The dealer was puzzled upon seeing her text.\*\*\*At 5 p.m., Guadalupe went to the parking lot.She was about to open her car door when she caught sight of another vehicle across from hers.It had already started, and through the car window, she saw Desmond in the back seat as well as that short-haired girl sitting next to him. The woman had a round, cute face, brimming with exuberance.""Mr. Harrison!""Harold was so frightened that he slammed on the brakes.Through the air and the glass, Guadalupe and Desmond locked eyes.Chapter 2 Satisfy My NeedsDesmond's eyes were deep.And Guadalupe's eyes were devoid of any emotion.The atmosphere in the parking lot was oppressive to the extreme.Looking at Guadalupe, Belinda Graham didn't distance herself from Desmond at all. Instead, she became even more presumptuous; she even wrapped her arm around his neck and leaned to his ear, whispering something.Guadalupe's eyes were stung by the scene.She averted her gaze, got into her car, and drove away, not glancing in their direction again.No longer after she arrived home, the sound of a car came from downstairs.As she stood in front of the glass cabinet in the cloakroom, taking off her necklace, Desmond stood behind her. His body was tall and beefy, and she felt his powerful aura at once.He propped his hands against the cabinet, leaned closer to her, and looked at her face. ""Are you upset?""She put away the necklace unhurriedly and said flatly, not looking at him even once, ""I'm so upset that I wanna murder someone. You better watch out.""Remaining silent for a while, he said, ""The Graham family wants to develop the Project 'Polaris' together with us. I've been in contact with Caleb lately. He's the family's eldest son. Ms. Graham is his sister.""She said sarcastically, ""Oh, so he won't work with you unless you're together with her?""He was rendered speechless for a few seconds before he said, sounding angry, ""Guadalupe, I'm explaining to you. Stop throwing shade at me.""""You don't need to explain."" Finally, she tilted her head to look at him, her gaze so icy and pure that he felt as if she could see through him. ""Desmond, if you're fed up with being with me and want a new hostess for this family, I can step down.""Desmond pulled a long face at once. ""What did you say?""She sighed, ""I mean, we can get a divorce.""Then she pushed him away.As she was about to walk away, he forcibly pulled her back, pinched her chin, and warned her, ""Don't even think about it.""She remained silent.She thought about it and even did it.She no longer wanted him.Desmond stayed until late at night. After receiving a call, he left. Guadalupe clearly heard a delicate female voice on the other end of the line, and it seemed the woman was crying.The next morning, Guadalupe's divorce lawyer and friend sent her a screenshot of Belinda's latest update. In the photo were two hands, one big and one small, making a heart shape on the mountaintop in the early hours of the morning. The caption read, ""We feel each other's heartbeat in the tender sunrise.""Guadalupe recognized right away that the big hand was Desmond's.She sat in situ, holding the glass of water for a long, long time.As she put it down, a crisp sound rang out. She felt as if a piece of her heart had been stripped away.For the next several days, Desmond never came home.They only met at the company's meetings. He sat in the main seat, and she sat on one side of the table together with other higher-ups. They barely had any eye contact.And she never came upstairs to see him.When she had some free time, she'd browse and view houses as well as get rid of the gifts Desmond had given her, including the first-anniversary gift, birthday gifts, Valentine's Day gifts, and wedding gifts... She even sold her wedding ring.Since she no longer wanted to be with him, anything related to their relationship meant nothing to her.At night, the owner of Rhodax Group, Ciara Orozco, invited her to hang out at a club.It was almost 11 p.m., and she wanted to say no at first. Yet, after she divorced Desmond and left Zenith Group, she'd need connections to start up her own business, so she eventually agreed.She saw Ciara the moment she entered the club.""Ciara, I could have gone up myself. You don't have to wait for me here at all,"" she said.Ciara linked arms with her enthusiastically and entered the elevator together with her. ""I was worried you'd get lost. You've never been here before, right?""Indeed, it was the first time she had been here.After they went upstairs, Ciara led her into a big private room with a big screen in the middle, dividing the private room into two halves.Upon entering, Guadalupe noticed quite a lot of people on the other side of the screen. But instead of taking her to them, Ciara led her to the side where there was only one woman.Guadalupe felt that the woman looked somehow familiar; it seemed she was the girlfriend of one of Desmond's buddies. The woman recognized Guadalupe, too. Though noticing the uneasy look on Guadalupe's face, she still smiled at Guadalupe.After Guadalupe took off her coat and sat down, Ciara walked out of the room.Guadalupe picked up a beverage and took a sip. The chatter of those people on the other side of the screen reached her ears; to her surprise, she heard her name.""Hey, has anyone realized Desmond no longer takes Guadalupe when hanging out with us?""""Is that surprising? Ms. Graham is so young and cute. He never goes anywhere without her; he dotes on her so much.""""Finally. After all these years, Desmond has changed his taste.""""Guadalupe is pretty indeed, but they've been together for eight years already. I bet he's sick of her.""""She's such a fool. It turns out those years being with him are just a waste of her time. What do you say I make a pass at her? Gee, I've been coveting her slender waist for years.""Their voices were filled with ridicule.Guadalupe's gaze turned icy.She recognized two people's voices; they were Desmond's friends who were always friendly towards her.The woman sitting next to Guadalupe was so awkward that she didn't dare to look at Guadalupe. Seeing that Guadalupe stood up, she figured Guadalupe was going to leave.However, Guadalupe cleared her throat, picked up the glass, and walked toward the other side of the screen. She then leaned against the screen and said leisurely, joining their conversation, ""Guys, that's not fair, is it? Desmond was a virgin before he was with me. Don't you think I've used him to satisfy my physical needs without paying him a penny for eight years?""The room immediately fell deadly silent.Everyone on the couch gawked at her.As she said this, two slender men happened to walk into the room.They looked at her and then shifted their gazes to those men behind her, totally dumbfounded.Chapter 3 Have FunDesmond stood behind Guadalupe, his expression icy.Noticing those people's gazes, Guadalupe turned around.Then she saw Desmond.She glanced at him and turned around to look at Belinda sitting on the couch. When she first showed up, Belinda crossed her legs, twirling her hair around her finger, looking smug.But the grin on Belinda's face was gone. Now, she looked so sullen as if she wanted to strangle Guadalupe on the spot.Guadalupe realized Belinda and Desmond were hanging out with their friends here. Judging from their conversation, it had happened more than once. It turned out the two had already made their appearances in public as a couple; they didn't bother to hide their affair at all.Desmond walked over to her.At the same time, those people came back to their senses.""Guadalupe, sorry. We were just blabbering. None of that was true.""""Guadalupe, there's nothing going on between Desmond and Ms. Graham.""""Guadalupe, don't take our words seriously.""Desmond grabbed Guadalupe's wrist and was about to drag her out.In the next second, she splashed the beverage on his face.Immediately, the room fell deadly silent again.Everyone felt a chill running down their spine; they had no idea Guadalupe was this bold.She broke the silence, saying softly with a smile, ""Continue to have fun with your darling, Desmond. I'll get out of your hair.""Then she lowered her head, trying to break free from his grip.Desmond's expression darkened to the utmost; he picked her up, carried her onto his shoulder, and walked outside.The people in the room were all slack-jawed.Then went to the hallway, and Guadalupe was struggling hard on Desmond's back.The elevator happened to arrive at this floor.As he walked into the elevator and turned around, she saw a pair of black leather shoes of fine quality. As she looked up, a pair of long legs wrapped in black suit trousers as well as a pair of fair hands came into view. Each finger was slender, with distinct knuckles.The quiet atmosphere was tinged with embarrassment.As Desmond stepped out of the elevator, she couldn't help but look up, only to meet a pair of sharp, deep, and charming eyes.Feeling awkward, she lowered her head while covering her face.Desmond dragged Guadalupe out of the club.He tossed her into the back seat of the car and sat next to her.Feeling dizzy, Guadalupe climbed up. She had been hung upside down for so long; coupled with being tossed into the car by him, she felt she was getting a concussion.Desmond took some wet tissues from the glove box to wipe his face.Guadalupe keenly noticed something that looked like a condom behind the tissue box when he questioned her, ""Why are you here? To catch me in the act?""She opened the car door to get out.Being in here sickened her.""Guadalupe!"" Irritated, Desmond grabbed her back. ""Where are you going? Cut it out! My patience is wearing thin.""Her breathing was a bit rapid as she pinched her palm. ""I wanna go home.""Desmond asked Harold, who was standing at the club entrance, to drive.On the way, neither Desmond nor Guadalupe said anything. She sat far away from him, her face pale, seemingly as if she might throw up at any second.Once they arrived, she got out of the car right away.It wasn't until she gulped down a whole glass of ice water in the kitchen that she finally felt better.As she walked out, she saw Desmond sitting in the living room. She walked over and sat down, too.After a long time of suffocating silence, Desmond spoke first, ""I was there to discuss a project. You rushed there and made a scene, which embarrasses me a lot. You've made a tit of yourself and are no different from a shrew. Haven't you realized that?""""Is that all you wanna say to me?"" she asked calmly.He continued, ""If you want things between us to work, stop being paranoid. I don't have time for your ridiculous suspicions.""She nodded. ""Noted. Anything else?""He frowned. After a few seconds, he said, ""Guadalupe, do you know how annoying you are right now?""She stood up, smiling while thinking, ""You won't feel annoyed soon.""She went upstairs.Her smile irritated Desmond even more. He sat in the living room for a while and went upstairs back to the bedroom, only to find she had already slept.He took a shower and lay down beside her.In the darkness, she had her back facing him. She moved further to the side of the bed, making sure her body wouldn't touch his no matter what.He hugged her from behind and forcibly pulled her into his arms, his movements tinged with fury.He was tall and beefy, and since he had exerted a bit of force, she couldn't move at all.She spent the night stiffly.In the morning, she made breakfast only for herself.Desmond came downstairs and saw her sitting in the dining room eating alone. He was about to head to the door, but then he turned around, walked to her, leaned to her ear, and coaxed her, his tone soft, ""Let's go out on the boat this weekend. Just the two of us.""While drinking milk, Guadalupe nodded nonchalantly.On Friday, he stood her up again, saying he had to fly to Crowham.She wasn't surprised; in fact, she didn't feel a thing.Maybe it hadn't occurred to him. The truth was, it had been ages since they last ate together or even spent some time together. He said divorce was out of the question, but he had already treated her as someone not important at all. If she disappeared one day, she seriously doubted if he'd care.On the weekend, she took her books from the bookshelf, put them in the suitcase, and took them to her new home.Just as she was placing her books, Elyse called her, which was a rare thing.She picked up and said politely, ""Hello, Madam Harrison.""Elyse snorted haughtily and then said, ""Come back. We should put what we discussed before in writing.""She asked, ""Is that really necessary?""Elyse said, ""If I say so.""""Fine. I'll go back this afternoon,"" she answered.Yet, Elyse wasn't satisfied. ""Come back at noon.""""Fine,"" she agreed, figuring that she didn't have anything else to do anyway.On the other end of the line, Elyse was standing on the second floor, looking at Desmond taking a walk with Belinda in the garden happily.Elyse was determined to let Guadalupe know Belinda was the one for Desmond; they were a perfect match.Chapter 4 Not AnymoreGuadalupe arrived at the Harrison's manor at around 11:40 a.m.The housekeeper was very surprised to see her.He knew they were expecting another guest, but little did he know it was Guadalupe. Thinking that Desmond and Belinda were in the living room right now, he felt his back covered in a cold sweat.Other than Desmond and Guadalupe's parents, only trusted subordinates such as Harold and the housekeeper knew Guadalupe and Desmond were married.""This way, Mrs. Harrison,"" the housekeeper said.He had no choice but to follow Elyse's instructions and lead the way for Guadalupe.Before they entered the living room, a sweet, coquettish voice rang out. ""I won again. Des, you deliberately let me win, didn't you?""Guadalupe stopped in her tracks.Her mind went blank for a second, but she soon figured out what was going on.Letting out a sneer, she walked inside.As she had planned on moving her books, she didn't wear any makeup today, and she dressed casually. She was wearing a loose white T-shirt and jeans, her long hair tied up loosely with a hairband.Yet, she still was strikingly beautiful with her fair skin and rosy lips, and the few wisps of hair that fell by her ears added a touch of allure to her beauty.Desmond was in the living room. Upon seeing her, he was stunned. ""Why are you...""""Elyse asked me to come here."" She looked calm, her eyes tinged with sarcasm. ""Weren't you supposed to be in Crowham? Even magicians couldn't pull this off.""Desmond said nothing, a trace of guilt flashing across his eyes.Belinda, who was sitting on the couch, walked over to Guadalupe and extended her hand provocatively. ""Hello there. I'm Belinda.""Guadalupe didn't even glance at her as if she hadn't existed at all.Just then, Elyse walked in.She glanced at Guadalupe and then held Belinda's hand, smiling kindly while saying, ""Are you happy today, Linda? Feel free to think of this place as your own home.""Then she introduced Guadalupe to Belinda, ""This is Ms. Melton, the manager of Zenith Group. I asked her to be here for business.""Everyone knew Guadalupe was with Desmond, but Elyse introduced her merely as the company's employee. Her implication was clear; she didn't want Guadalupe to be part of the family at all. Meanwhile, she was hinting to Belinda that Guadalupe didn't stand in the way at all. The Graham family and the Harrison family could perfectly be united by marriage.Belinda raised her face proudly. ""She's just a company's employee? I see.""Ignoring Elyse and Belinda, Guadalupe started at Desmond quietly.She wanted to know what his reaction would be.He remained looking indifferent all this time, showing no intention of speaking up for her at all.Didn't he know Elyse and Belinda were giving Guadalupe a hard time? He knew, of course. He simply didn't care how embarrassed she was.""Madam Harrison, you wanted to discuss business with me, didn't you? How about we discuss it here?"" She turned to look at Elyse.Elyse said, ""That can wait. We'll talk about it some other day. Since you're here, why don't you eat with us?""""I'll pass. I've got something to do."" Guadalupe turned to leave.Elyse snapped, ""I'm your elder, and I said, stay and eat with us. What's that attitude? You've got no manners at all.""Guadalupe turned back and stared at Elyse for a while, her gaze cold. ""OK. I'll stay and eat with you. Don't regret this.""She then walked over and chose a single seat.Belinda sat next to Desmond matter-of-factly and wrapped her arms around his arm. ""Des, let's continue to play chess.""Yet, Desmond pulled out his arm and looked at Guadalupe.""Ms. Melton, do you know how to play chess?"" Belinda looked at Guadalupe.Guadalupe glanced at the chess made of excellent material on the coffee table. At first glance, she could tell they were playing Five in a Row, which was practically child's play, but Desmond actually lost to Belinda.It turned out Desmond still knew exactly how to please a woman; it was just she wasn't the woman he wanted to please anymore.She looked up at Desmond, sneering coldly, ""Yeah. Ms. Graham, do you wanna play?""Desmond seemed a bit annoyed. He looked at Guadalupe, warning her with his eyes.Meanwhile, Belinda reset the board confidently. ""Ms. Melton, take your pick. Do you want black or white?""Guadalupe took the white pieces. ""You may have a head start with the black pieces.""Feeling being looked down upon, Belinda gritted her teeth and made the first move.As they played, Elyse noticed that Belinda had been playing methodically, while Guadalupe's moves made no sense at all. She favored Belinda to begin with, so she didn't bother to observe the board. Instead, she turned to Desmond, saying to him with her eyes, ""See? Belinda is the true well-bred daughter of a prestigious family.""Desmond, however, had no reaction at all.Soon, both Belinda and Guadalupe had made several moves. Every time Belinda felt that she was about to win, Guadalupe always managed to stop her, and she couldn't help but feel a bit irritated. She told herself it was OK; after all, Guadalupe hadn't won either. At worst, it would be a draw.She snorted deep down, finding it humiliating to reach a draw with Guadalupe.""Your turn,"" Guadalupe said.Belinda had already placed three pieces in an unnoticed corner. One more piece, and she'd win.She pretended to be calm and placed a piece. Then she looked at Guadalupe, worried that Guadalupe would stop her again. To her relief, Guadalupe placed her piece somewhere else. Seeing this, she got carried away and shouted, ""I won!""Elyse immediately applauded, happy for her.Yet, in the next second, Guadalupe started to pick up the pieces one by one slowly.Only then did Elyse and Belinda see Guadalupe's pieces had formed a row of five.Their faces turned pale at once.Chapter 5 She Feels FamiliarGuadalupe picked up the remaining two pieces.Five in a Row was a one-win game, but Belinda wasn't willing to admit defeat. To save face, she said unreasonably, ""You won first, but I've got five pieces. I won, too.""She put another piece next to her pieces which had forced a row of four after saying this.Guadalupe was rendered speechless. She looked at Belinda for a few seconds as if looking at a fool and then said, ""According to you, I can continue, too, right?""Then she placed another piece on the board and formed another row of five.In the following minute, she took almost all the pieces on the board and made sure Belinda couldn't get another piece at all.Belinda's expression changed. She insisted on having another round.They played again and again.Guadalupe either played with her unhurriedly while savoring the victory or played with accuracy and ruthlessness and won her very soon, humiliating her to the utmost.Belinda was so frustrated and furious that she cried.""Enough.""Desmond took Guadalupe's box of pieces, his expression chillingly icy.He took Belinda's side, and she threw herself into his arms while crying pitifully as if Guadalupe had bullied her.Desmond comforted her softly while Elyse echoed, too. Then Elyse turned to Guadalupe and scolded her harshly, ""It's just Five in a Row. Do you have to be so serious? You're from a mediocre family and have never seen the world indeed. You're so petty. All you know is fighting for attention.""Her voice gradually faded away in Guadalupe's ears.Guadalupe looked at Desmond, feeling that his face was like a faded photo. He used to be so dazzling, yet now, she could barely recognize him anymore.She thought, ""Forget it.""Only twenty days left. I shouldn't care.""He can do whatever he wants.""She tossed the pieces in her hand onto the board in a devil-may-care manner and stood up to leave, looking lazy and indifferent.A few drops of blood fell onto the board. After she walked out, she realized her fingers were cold. Only then did she know she had clenched her fist so hard that her nails had been dug into her palm, and blood was oozing out.""Guadalupe!"" Desmond called her name, his voice tinged with a trace of concern.He wanted to stand up to chase after her, but Belinda wrapped her arms around his waist and cried even harder.Guadalupe left the Harrison's manor.On her way back, her phone rang non-stop. It was Desmond, and she blocked his number.Then she texted Elyse, ""250 million dollars. A penny less, and I'll make sure you pay the price.""Elyse almost had a heart attack when she saw the message.\*\*\*Guadalupe drove on.Before she realized it, the sky had become gloomy, and it started to rain, which somehow diverted her attention.Suddenly, a flash of yellow light darted. A yellow motorcycle whooshed around and cut in front of her. Startled, she hit the brakes.In the next second, a huge bang rang out.Given the great impact, she hit her head on the steering wheel hard.A sharp pain started from the corner of her forehead and spread to her entire body.She looked up, and everything seemed blurred and red.Taking out a tissue, she wiped off the blood that blurred her vision.She had been rear-ended, and the yellow motorcycle that came out of nowhere had already vanished.Suddenly, someone knocked on the car door.She rolled down the window.Outside the car stood a man in his forties, wearing glasses with a black umbrella in his hand. He seemed gentle and elegant, and he said apologetically, ""I'm sorry, Ma'am. I rear-ended you, and I'll take full responsibility. And ... there are some urgent matters my employer needs to attend to right now. Could we exchange our numbers? I'll reach out to you later. You can draw up a list of compensation. We will pay for everything.""""Just leave it to the police.""Already in a sour mood, Guadalupe was startled twice, and she felt so frustrated that she wanted to scream.She opened the car door, got out, and walked to the back of the car. Seeing that her car's rear was already dented because of the Bentley behind, she frowned, took photos, and called the police.Looking at her, the man felt it'd be inappropriate to stop her, so he came back to the car and reported, ""Mr. Hodge, she insists on having the police handle it. What do you...""The rain grew heavier.The windshield wipers cleared the rainwater from the glass, and it was soon blurred again. Ezequiel Hodge leaned against the car door lazily, looking at Guadalupe, who was on the phone while covering her forehead with one hand. She looked dejected, and the white shirt on her had already been soaked by the rain. Rainwater fell on her thick eyelashes, and as they trembled, it fell onto her rosy lips...""Mr. Hodge?"" Miguel Walton called his name again.Ezequiel lowered his gaze and checked the time on his watch. ""Gilbert Dalton is on his way. I'll leave with him. You can stay here and handle it.""Gilbert Dalton was Ezequiel's assistant. ""OK, Mr. Hodge,"" Miguel said, nodding.Guadalupe went back to her car.Soon, the police arrived, followed by a silver Maybach.The police car and the Maybach almost stopped at the same time.She got out of the car.Meanwhile, the people from the Bentley stepped out, too.Besides the driver, another man got out. He looked tall, slender, aloof, and noble. He had pale skin, but it wasn't the sickly type. Noticing her gaze, he glanced at her, his eyes deep and charming, his gaze sharp and almost intimidating.Somehow, she felt familiar.""Give it to her.""Ezequiel gave the suit jacket draping over his arm to Miguel and then sat in the Maybach, not glancing at her again.Then Miguel trotted up to Guadalupe with the suit jacket and said, ""Ma'am, your shirt is wet. Put this on.""Guadalupe looked down, only to see her white shirt pressed against her body, revealing the bra beneath.Embarrassed, she took the suit jacket and put it on. ""Thank you.""While Miguel talked to the police, the Maybach slowly started and drove off into the rain. Guadalupe only got to catch a glimpse of Ezequiel's striking profile.His suit jacket was still warm with his body temperature, and a faint woody fragrance dispelled the chill from the rain.The police soon handled the situation and concluded the incident. Both Miguel and Guadalupe had no objections, and he offered to take her to the hospital for the wound on her head.She turned him down politely. By now, she had already calmed down. Thinking back to her overreaction, she apologized to him, saying she was in a foul mood, and it wasn't their problem. She said, ""I'll send the suit jacket to you by courier after I have it dry-cleaned.""Miguel didn't say no; he nodded, though he knew Ezequiel well enough to know Ezequiel probably wouldn't want it anyway.Guadalupe went to the hospital alone.Desmond couldn't reach her no matter what. Looking at the heavy rain, he had a bad feeling.Just then, he got the news that she had a car accident.Chapter 6 What a Narcissist!Guadalupe sat in the treatment room while her wound was being treated.Suddenly, the door was pushed open, and a handsome man stormed in with a murderous look, which startled the doctor.She glanced back at him and said to the doctor, ""It's fine. He's my ... boss.""Desmond heard her words.Feeling annoyed somehow, he walked over, asking the doctor, ""Is it serious?""The doctor replied, ""No. It's just a superficial wound.""Not bothering to know their relationship, the doctor dealt with Guadalupe's wound and prescribed her some topical medication.She thanked him and walked out.Desmond followed closely behind her, paying for the treatment and taking the medicine eagerly as if he were a great husband.Guadalupe didn't bother to stop him.After getting out of the hospital, she took out her phone, wanting to order a ride. Seeing this, Desmond grabbed her phone away, wrapped an arm around her shoulders, and forcibly took her to the parking lot. He opened the door to the passenger seat, shoved her into the car, and then got in himself from the other side of the car.He slammed the car door shut, instantly cutting off the sounds outside.The atmosphere inside the car was oppressive.""You blocked my number and tried to top yourself just to punish me?"" He turned to look at her, looking angry and impatient as if he had had enough of it.Guadalupe felt speechless for a moment.Then she looked back at him and couldn't help but burst into laughter at the sight of his sullen face.She wasn't in a great mood, but his words amused her.He cheated on her, and she tried to punish him by killing herself?He was the biggest narcissist she had ever seen.""Chill. That's not gonna happen. Give me my phone."" She wanted to get her phone back from his hand.But he moved his hand away. ""I admit that I lied to you, but you shouldn't have given Belinda a hard time. She ended up crying. Don't you feel guilty at all? She's pampered and sometimes says and does things willfully. Why couldn't you be the bigger person?""Listening to the words he used to describe Belinda, Guadalupe could tell how much he doted on Belinda.She thought, ""Desmond, I can barely recognize you anymore.""After a long time of silence, she said, her voice filled with powerlessness since she was completely disheartened, ""I won't give her a hard time from now on, and I won't stand in the way of the two of you. But you should keep her in control. Make sure she doesn't mess with me.""""She's like my sister. It's not what you think."" Desmond frowned.""Yeah, right."" She had to try very hard not to throw the proof onto his face to expose him. ""I was being impulsive and thought too much. OK? Congratulations on having a new sister.""He fell silent.""Drive."" She felt a chill to the core, so she wrapped herself more tightly in the suit jacket. The tip of her nose brushed against the collar, and she smelt that warm, woody scent again.It wasn't until now that Desmond noticed the high-quality light-gray men's suit she was wearing. Clearly, it was a privately customized piece. ""Whose suit is this?""She turned to look outside the window and said sarcastically, ""My new brother.""Desmond felt speechless for a second.Then he forcibly pulled off the jacket and tossed it outside the window, looking sullen.Both stunned and pissed off, she wanted to get out of the car to pick it up; she promised to give it back.Seeing this, Desmond was even more annoyed. He yanked her back, leaned over, and kissed her lips with great force.She bit her lip tightly.Noticing her resistance, he pinched her chin and forced his tongue in her mouth, not allowing her to say no.After he was done, he leaned back in his seat, though she could still feel his heavy breath on her face. ""Don't try to upset me using this way. At least consider other people's lives.""Guadalupe said nothing.She felt utterly speechless.In the end, she didn't get to pick up the suit.What should she do? It seemed she couldn't keep her promise.\*\*\*After the incident, Guadalupe caught a cold and developed a fever that very night.Desmond stayed by her side, making soup and feeding it to her, giving her the illusion that maybe he still had feelings for her.At midnight, she still had a fever. Drifting in and out of unconsciousness, she felt uncomfortable.Suddenly, Desmond's phone on the bedside table buzzed.She propped up and looked at the phone at the same time Desmond did; it was 12:35 a.m.The name on the screen was ""Bel"".What an intimate way to address Belinda.The night was quiet, which made the buzz particularly piercing. The phone buzzed on the bedside table, striking the nerves of the two at the same time.Chapter 7 Useless TrashGuadalupe remained silent.Meanwhile, Desmond tried to look calm, but the uneasiness in his eyes was more than obvious.His phone kept buzzing. Belinda either called him or invited him for a video chat, but he didn't answer. In the end, she started to text him ceaselessly and blatantly.The atmosphere in the room grew intense.""Aren't you gonna do something?"" Guadalupe said mockingly.Only then did Desmond pick up his phone. Not even glancing at the screen, he turned it off and then put it back on the bedside table.Then he felt her forehead. ""Still a bit hot. It's fine; go to sleep. I'll keep an eye on you.""She lay down and closed her eyes.After an hour, she breathed evenly; it seemed she was asleep.Then Desmond picked up his phone, turning it on while walking to the balcony. After reading the messages, he made a call. ""Is she OK? Don't worry. I'll be right back...""He lowered his voice while saying. After walking back to the room, he picked up his jacket and left.Behind him, Guadalupe opened her eyes in silence.She had been awake throughout this whole time.In fact, she had no idea what she was hoping. Once a man changed and fell in love with another woman, he'd be no different from a spoiled fruit that only rotted further.At 4:30 a.m., Desmond came back.Seeing that Guadalupe was still asleep, he looked relieved. Then he felt her forehead again and found that it wasn't burning anymore.",1,1748669289.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1kzpgyf,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1kzpgyf/my_cousin_is_deceiving_a_guy_online/,My cousin is deceiving a guy online,"Hey everyone. If this story rings a bell, it’s probably because I shared it before under a different account. I ended up deleting that one, but I’m back to tell it properly this time.

My cousin, let’s call her Tahmina, is a 24-year-old Afghan woman raised in the U.S., though you wouldn’t really know it from the way she’s been brought up. Before anyone rushes to judge her for how she balances culture, faith, and freedom, just know this isn’t about criticism. Our families can be deeply confusing, even to those of us who grew up inside them.

Tahmina’s life is painfully restricted. She’s not allowed to have friends outside the family. Her parents won’t buy her a car, so they shuttle her to and from work like she’s still in high school. She’s banned from using social media, though she secretly runs an Instagram account. It’s one of her few windows to the outside world.

And yet, somehow, she's expected to be the star at every wedding. At big, mixed-gender Afghan weddings, her mom encourages her to perform solo dances, sometimes for 10 to 15 minutes at a time. These aren’t shy, subtle routines. They’re dramatic and often provocative. It’s one of those contradictions that just doesn’t make sense. She can’t grab lunch with a friend, but it’s fine to dance in front of 300 strangers.

Now that our generation of cousins, most of us between 19 and 28, is getting married one by one, the pressure on Tahmina is at an all-time high. The last cousin got engaged in a traditional arrangement, and since then, her mom has been relentless. She tells Tahmina she needs to find someone now before she becomes ""expired.”

But even as they demand that she find a husband, they sabotage her ability to do so. Her parents insist he must be Afghan, no exceptions, even though many of us have married non-Afghan Muslims without any issue. But for her, the rules are different. They won’t introduce her to anyone, won’t allow her on dating apps, and shut down any idea that might actually help her meet someone. Then they ridicule her as if it’s her fault she’s still single.

Tahmina and her parents are also extremely traditional in other ways, including how they approach health. That might sound quirky until you realize how serious it gets. Tahmina has a grapefruit-sized goiter growing in her neck. I wish I were exaggerating, but I’m not. Her solution is holistic oil rubs, vegan detoxes, and YouTube advice. Meanwhile, medical professionals in our family have pulled her aside gently and begged her to get checked. They’ve told her with care and concern, please seek real treatment before it gets worse. But she always lashes out, saying she won’t poison her body with medications or support the pharmaceutical industry.

It’s frustrating and heartbreaking because she’s 24 but emotionally still very much a child. It’s like watching someone try to carry the weight of adult choices without the tools, preparation, or support.

And now, here’s where the story gets even more complicated.

She’s in love. With an Indian guy she met online. He lives in Germany and he’s kind, sweet, and respectful. From what she tells me, they talk constantly. They’ve video-called, he’s seen her photos, and now he’s planning to fly to the U.S. with his mother to meet her in person. He is serious about proposing.

There’s just one problem. He doesn’t know about the goiter.

She wears scarves and turtlenecks during their video calls and always keeps the angle just right. When we were sitting at a coffee shop recently, she told me everything about how excited she is and how she believes he is the one. I asked her gently if he had asked about her throat.

She looked me dead in the eyes and said, “He doesn’t know about it.”

I pressed her. I told her this wasn’t just a small omission, it was deception. He’s coming with the intention of proposing, and he doesn’t know something this big. Her response was a full-on monologue about how she deserves to be loved for who she is and how looks aren’t everything. She said she’s finally found someone who accepts her. Then she added, “The doctor on YouTube guaranteed this will go down in three months with oil.”

I was stunned. I don’t even know how to contact this guy. I don’t have his Instagram or number or anything. But I can already see the heartbreak coming. Not because she doesn’t deserve love. She absolutely does. But because she’s walking into something with a fragile heart and a reality she refuses to face. And if it falls apart, which it very likely will, I don’t know if she’ll bounce back. She’s been so beaten down by her parents and so emotionally stunted that I honestly worry what kind of damage this could do.

It’s like watching someone board a plane with no parachute, completely convinced they can fly.

I rarely take the B line and was blessed with the brand new train from 7th Metro to Vermont/Sunset. It was beautiful to see and made me so excited about the future of transit here. Everyone behaved and there was a good mix of people.

She’s never been the spotlight type. She doesn’t dress for red carpets, doesn’t post curated stories, and doesn’t belong in the glossy world of headlines and flashing cameras. She’s the girl behind the scenes—the one who brings him coffee when he’s locked in the studio for 18 hours, the one who slips love notes into his bags before he flies across the world, the one who stays silent when the tabloids pair him with someone else again. She’s known him long before the world did, before the fame and the tours and the ego. And somewhere along the way, she fell in love with him, not the celebrity, but the boy he used to be when no one else was watching.

But somewhere along the way, she became invisible.

The story begins on her birthday, just a regular Tuesday to him. She doesn’t expect much, never has. Just a few hours. Maybe a walk. Maybe a movie night on the couch like they used to do before his phone never stopped buzzing. She doesn’t say it outright. She never demands. She just smiles, soft-spoken as ever, and suggests, “Maybe when you're done at the studio… we could just do something. Anything, really.” But he brushes her off, distracted, already halfway out the door.

She doesn’t cry. Not right away. She just sits in the quiet, one hand pressed over her belly—a new secret, just barely beginning to show. A life growing inside her. His child. And yet she wonders if he’ll even notice when she’s gone. Because she’s not angry. Just tired. Tired of being a second thought in a life she never asked to compete with. Tired of giving everything and receiving almost nothing in return.

\----

I’m looking for someone to write the role of the celebrity in this emotional, gut-wrenching, slow-burn story about love, neglect, and the quiet kind of heartbreak that comes from being forgotten. Your character could be a musician, actor, influencer or whatever feels right. The key is that he’s lost in his world, unaware of how much he’s hurting the only person who’s never wanted anything from him but love.

This story will be driven by vulnerability, emotional tension, slow-burn revelations, and the haunting ache of unspoken truths. I’m open to building a world together like past memories, public drama, media pressure, and the weight of what they once had.

Noida, India: 13th May 2025 – The second day of the 9th Global Fashion and Design Week Noida 2025, held at the iconic Marwah Studios, emerged as a vibrant celebration of creativity, culture, and couture, confidently carrying forward the festival’s global spirit. The day witnessed extraordinary enthusiasm from designers, students, and international dignitaries, reinforcing Noida’s position as a rising hub of fashion education and cultural dialogue.



Dr. Sandeep Marwah, Festival President and Chancellor of AAFT University, addressed the gathering with passion and conviction, stating, “Fashion and Design is the need of the day. It transcends borders and impacts every sector — from lifestyle to innovation, from identity to industry. Every individual, every nation needs fashion to reflect their spirit.”



The event was honored by the gracious presence of H.E. Juan Antonio March Pujol, Ambassador of Spain to India, who attended as the Chief Guest. In his powerful address, he appreciated the cultural depth and creative ingenuity of the students, underlining the role of such platforms in strengthening people-to-people ties between nations.



Adding dynamism to the day were esteemed industry professionals and jury members including: Rimjhim Jaggi, Director, Sassafras, Zenia Malhotra, Jury Member & Head Designer, IDI Design,Vaishali, Renowned Architect & Jury Member, Doodle Studio. Anil Kumar Dev Renowned business man.



A unique global fashion journey was witnessed on the runway, as students of AAFT School of Fashion & Design showcased garments inspired by various countries: Tunisia was portrayed in smart casuals by Shipriya., Egypt’s traditional essence was captured beautifully by AAFT Raipur students. Mongolia’s nomadic soul was reflected in casual wear by Riyu. Georgia inspired Pujita to craft elegant fusion wear. Malaysia’s rich heritage was translated into ethnic garments by Nivedita. Spain inspired Arshia and Jigisha to design vibrant fusion ensembles. Bosnia & Herzegovina’s contemporary youth culture was depicted as street wear by Palak and Sadika. Chad’s cultural expressions were transformed into innovative fusion wear by Riya.



One of the highlights of the day was the launch of an exclusive coffee table book titled “Crimson Void”, authored by Rashika Bhagat, a promising student from AAFT School of Fashion Communication. The book is a visual narrative exploring emotional abstraction through the lens of fashion, art, and media, garnering much admiration from the audience.



With thought-provoking designs, cross-cultural creativity, and an infusion of international collaborations, the second day of the 9th Global Fashion and Design Week left an indelible mark on the fashion landscape. The festival continues to serve as a catalyst for talent, dialogue, and design excellence under the visionary leadership of Dr. Sandeep Marwah and the creative force of AAFT.

**Accolade East offers a rich community with frequent events and hangouts planned by the complex.

1kzp5rw,https://v.redd.it/fnpi06f6w14f1,For my Dodger fans I know we won… but when is enough finally enough with Miguel Dumbass Rojas?,"Look, I’m usually patient with our guys. I’ve stood by Muncy, Pages, even Conforto. But what Rojas did tonight? Just flat-out idiotic. Selfish. Zero situational awareness. You’ve got the best player alive—Shohei Ohtani—on deck with two bombs already, bases loaded, crowd buzzing… and you swing into an inning-killing double play??

Like bro, you’re a certified DP machine. Even if you weren’t, know the damn moment. Let Shohei come up and do what Shohei does. The fans wanted it. The team needed it. Hell, even some Yankee fans deep down probably wanted to witness that. Instead, Rojas plays hero ball and kills the vibe.

And we’re still giving him ABs like he’s some key piece of this team. Why? We already DFA’d CT3 and Barnes—both of whom actually did things for this org. Taylor gave us elite versatility and clutch postseason moments. Barnes caught a title run. Rojas? He’s done none of that. And now he’s actively blocking guys like Kiley or Freeland from getting a shot. Even if Freeland’s not ready, give him a cup of coffee. Let us see.

I don’t get the blind loyalty to this guy. Especially after that Jazz Chisholm drama—dude’s rubbed me the wrong way ever since. And I know what people will say: “But he’s a great clubhouse guy.”

Bro… we’ve got enough of those. Shohei, Mookie, Freddie, Kersh, Max, Doc—how many leaders does one clubhouse need?? If any of them don’t consider themselves leaders, they better start. You’re getting superstar checks? Act like one on and off the field.

I know this sounds like a rant (it is), and yeah—we won. But we all want to chase history. Regular season wins, back-to-back chips, legendary runs. Keeping Miguel Dumbass in the mix is not how you do it. At some point, enough is enough.",0,1748668141.0,mlb,32,0.18,False

1kzozyo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzozyo,Thank you Coffee Stain - You may have saved my life...,"I got Satisfactory on a whim because I was having the worst panic response I've ever felt in my life and could not shake it 

(Believe it or not, it was all over a date that went poorly. It irrevocably shook me to my core - to the point that it felt like I was going to die for days on end. Could not catch my breath, could not calm down - Could not think beyond what was right in front of me)  
  
I have to admit that when I put it in my cart, I thought this would be like everything else I've been picking up the last few years - Outside of Slay the Spire, I can't really play more than 10 hours of anything without growing bored or frustrated. But I picked it up and played, I think, for 5 hours straight the first evening. No clue what I was doing, of course, but it was the first time I had felt calm in days - I could think and catch my breath. 

I think the planet felt safe - Everything here that could hurt me, I could defend myself from. It didn't matter if I built something wrong or poorly, I could fix it and adapt and learn without someone peeking over my shoulder. Without even the voice in my head criticizing me for not being good enough. 

The game didn't always make sense to me (Going back to play now, knowing what I know, would be a lot different - namely not waiting until phase 4 to begin hunting hard drives...) but it felt like I could be curious for the first time in a long time. That I could begin to move confidently again because making mistakes wouldn't get me hurt here.

That was nearly 6 months ago - I've been playing often. It's felt meditative and, when I felt myself going to that dark place, even on the planet, I could listen to audiobooks on attachment and trauma and anxiety - I've since started therapy and yoga and joined a bouldering gym (Up to V5 in just 6 months!) and I feel a sense of contentment that I don't think I would have found if I didn't have a space to start exploring confidently. I'm probably going on SSRIs next week, we'll see what my psychiatrist says. But I don't think I'd be here without Coffee Stain and this game.

I know it's not everyone's cup a tea - but the community here has been an incredible support system to me when I really needed one. They think like me, and feel like me - They struggle and cry and quit and feel sad and they're proud and they're curious and complicated and silly. This subreddit on top of some really incredible youtubers, like Xaos, ValhallanPickle and OrbitalPotato and more have made me feel like I'm not alone on some very lonely evenings. Hell, I even have been enjoying the math and figuring out ratios and balancing.  I hate that it's over - I'm not sure when, or if, I'll play it again (Ironic to beat this just before 1.1 comes out) - It's not that I'm leaving this place behind but it's more like I finally move forward. This is something tangible I can close on my life to say 'You did it - you finished this chapter' - Instead of running away from pain, I can now begin to walk towards joy.

[Patricia Bovin - 22 years old - Died April 24, 1969](https://www.londonpolice.ca/en/about/unsolved-murders.aspx#)  
Patricia Bovin was a single mother who lived in the upper apartment of 790 King St, London Ontario with her sons. On Thursday, April 24, 1969, at approximately 4:00pm, someone attended Patricia's home and discovered that she was dead. The London Police Force was called and several officers responded.

Our investigation found that the cause of Patricia's death was homicide after suffering several stab wounds.

If you have any information about this murder please call us.

[Patricia Bovin's home was located on the north side of King St just west of Rectory St in London, Ontario.](https://preview.redd.it/8ff70y8ys14f1.jpg?width=753&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5a085932037d33045e8f7d82645f0a06af727457)

1kzot02,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1kzot02/my_babys_first_birthday_was_a_disaster_i_dont/,My baby’s first birthday was a disaster I don’t know what to think,"This happened a while ago but I’m still deeply hurt and I want to know if this has happened to anyone else and how they handled it. 

Context, I had a cryptic pregnancy, didn’t know I was pregnant till I was labor. Still traumatized but trying to focus on being a good mom lol. So I never got a baby shower or maternity photos. I dont know the joy of being pregnant and planning for a baby/family. 

My family was less than supportive. It’s too much to get into but 6mo after having my baby I went no contact with my family. (Really all I did was stop asking for help and they never checked on me, they didn’t know I was no contact for a while)

2 months before her first birthday I called my dad and said I would like to invite them to her party and reconcile. I told him this party was going to be huge because I never got a baby shower and I had been saving up ever since I realized I wasn’t getting one. He seemed on board. I reached out to mine and my husband’s close family and relatives and I told them an invite will be sent out soon and to save the date.  

Everyone acted excited and I was feeling confident. There was an issue with the invites tho and I take the blame for that. They didn’t get sent out till a month before the party and a few of them were getting sent back to me so while everyone had the date in advance, I was scrambling to send out e-vites and practically begging for RSVPs. Most responded yes and some just said “thanks for the invite.” I’m autistic I don’t know if that means yes or no. Either way I had a yes on 68 people and planned accordingly. I had 50 gift bags for the kids and I bought I think 3 or 4 platters of jimmy johns subs. I baked a ton of treats and my MIL (bless her) worked her ass off to make a shit ton of her famous coffee. 

The theme was “chapter one” and I bought 48 blank hard cover books with all the markers and stickers you can imagine for everyone to decorate. Her party was in late winter early spring so i couldn’t do anything out doors. I also had a few other activities for the adults to do; A time capsule where they could write a note to her to open when she’s 18, an adorable slide show on both the TVs, children’s books that they could read with their kids as well as an assortment of toys for all ages. 

So the morning of my husband runs to town to pick up the sandwiches and I’m setting up as best as I can. A few things have already gone wrong but of course that’s gonna happen. My family showed up a few minutes early which was nice but they were all dressed in sweats and pajamas. I understand my teen sisters dressing that way but I had a photographer coming and my family knew that. And what’s worse is my family is literally known in my home town for being well dressed. For some reason they let my dad be in charge of buying gifts off the registry? My mom told it like it was a funny story he went to target right before coming to the party and bought what I wanted, but he didn’t buy it from the registry. So I ended up having doubles of 4 gifts. then they had my youngest sister wrap the gifts in the car. In Christmas wrapping paper. Christmas was long over. 

So I’m pretending to keep it chill in my beautiful dress while telling the photographer that I hope we can still make it work even tho no one is dressed up but me and my baby. 

Then the texts start rolling in right as the party is starting and I’m trying to get the music going and my husband is late with the food and it’s lunch time. Text after text saying “sorry we’re sick so we Can’t come anymore” mostly from my sister in laws. 4 people that rsvpd yes didn’t show up no call or text. But also from my side of the family, people that live farther away said they didn’t realize the party was out of town when they responded yes. 

So we ended up having about 35 people show up, when I planned for 70. My daughter got no gifts from my husbands side of the family except my MIL handmade a gorgeous dress. The two women from my husbands side that did show up left after about 30 minutes. I actually got more people from my old job show up, say hi, and bring a neatly wrapped gift. 

I’m not asking for much I don’t think. People in my family have had way bigger parties where everyone dressed up and brought a gift. I personally think it’s because they don’t respect me. Everyone is nice to my face but when I need support or god forbid to be celebrated for keeping a child, I didn’t know I was having, alive for a whole year..no one cares. 

Anyone else plan a party and no one came? Should I just take the L? Should I even bother planning a 2 yr party? At least I had coffee treats and sandwiches to drown in the next day I guess.

I recently had some time away to do some intensive therapy. On the way I stopped off at the Pick a Brick wall and grabbed a few boxes with nothing particular in mind - it was a much a comfort thing to have something familiar with me. On the first day I took great delight in sorting the bricks into paper coffee cups. 

Anyway, I had been planning to create a timeline off my life in Excel for ages based on Tim Urban’s visualisation of weeks (waitbutwhy.com). I did that, but it didn’t really help. Then I spotted all the headlight bricks and decided to build a Lego version. 

The columns are months, rows are years since my birth. Colours are different houses and places I have lived. Just starting to map significant events on there like starting schools/jobs/kids etc. 

I found it really useful to see this physically, particularly how compressed adult life is, and seeing how multiple life events happened at once. 

People on my course seemed to like it - it is very fragile but now I am home I will reinforce it. There are many better ways to build it, but I was working with the pieces I had!

1kzolj2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzolj2,[REVIEW] Cabana Restaurant in Mactan – Instagrammable but underwhelming in flavor and portions,"
Restaurant Name: Cebu Cabana Grill & Seafood Restaurant
Location: The Mark Resort & Spa Punta Engano St., Lapu-lapu, Cebu
Picture: (See attached food + ambiance photos)

⸻

My Experience:

Checked out Cabana Restaurant recently because of its coastal charm and scenic seaside view. No doubt — this place is a vibe. White interiors, ocean breeze, and a gorgeous poolside view that makes you feel like you’re on vacation even if you’re just out for lunch.

But while the ambiance was a solid 10/10, the food unfortunately didn’t live up to the price tags.

PROS:
	•	Beautiful resort-like ambiance with open-air seating and a relaxing sea view
	•	Food presentation is IG-worthy (that mango rose on the salad? Chef’s kiss 👌)
	•	Polite staff overall (except one… see below)

CONS:
	•	Cabana Mango Salad (₱450): Small serving for the price. Looks pretty, but felt more decorative than satisfying.
	•	Triple Formaggio Scallops (₱425): I expected creamy, cheesy richness… but it came out dry and lacking flavor.
	•	Mango Salsa Rock Lobster (₱1550): Flavor was good, tropical salsa paired well—but two small lobsters cut into four didn’t justify the hefty price.
	•	Pork Tomahawk (₱1450): Big plate, generous cut. But the meat was bland without the gravy. Needed more seasoning.
	•	One waitress looked like she didn’t want to be there. When I asked something, she just left mid-convo. Not the best impression.

⸻

Would I go back?
Maybe for coffee, a cocktail, or to chill and enjoy the view—but not specifically for a full meal again unless they rework their portions and flavors. It’s a place to enjoy the setting, not necessarily the food (yet).

⸻

My Rating (out of 5):
	•	Food: ⭐️⭐️
	•	Service: ⭐️⭐️⭐️
	•	Price: ⭐️⭐️
	•	Location: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️
	•	Willingness to come back: ⭐️⭐️",9,1748666156.0,CebuRestaurantReviews,0,1.0,False

I'm fairly sure I don’t remember the details of the process anymore, besides the huge fear of potentially getting bacteria in my mead, which was overblown. Last time, I removed it a bit too quickly (4 months) under pressure. I won’t be doing that again, I'm going to let it sit from 6 months to a year. I'm looking for a semi-sweet melomel recipe without doing something like backsweetening, and hopefully, the recipe guides me every step of the way. I still have the last bottled mead remaining from my first mead. It’s been sitting there, and it does have a decent bit of sediment in it at the bottom. I tasted it, it’s not ruined or anything, but it doesn’t feel special. It tastes like any other not-sweet wine I’ve had. Still fun to drink, I must admit... I am not a person of subtlety and don’t quite understand subtle and complex flavors that people claim to have when they drink alcohol or bitter coffee (though I do enjoy how alcohol feels or when it is mixed in cocktails). So, I’m hoping I can discover those flavors even within sweet meads or melomels. I would appreciate some guidance and thank you for reading.",2,1748665734.0,mead,0,1.0,False

Anyway, it was one of those genuinely fun moments that just brightened my day a little... anyone else had a fun or silly encounter like that lately? 😊",9,1748665519.0,chemistryClicks,0,1.0,False
1kzoc7n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthygamergg/comments/1kzoc7n/three_years_is_what_it_took_i_must_let_her_go_or/,"Three years is what it took, I must let her go, or the cycle repeats.","Hi all, I (21M) am going through the most emotional pain and heartache I've ever felt in my life yet. I've fallen in love and have, just now, ""broken up"" with a girl I've given all of my understanding, love and empathy to. I'm writing this post, not to point blame, not to demonise her, not to understand further or to ""fix"" her, but to find greater understanding within myself, because I feel literally insane. My mind and heart has shattered into a million pieces, and I don't even know what's real anymore. I will keep this as unbiased as possible, and give depth and perspective into both sides, with quotes both of us said.

  
**About me:** My utmost important values are empathy, kindness, and understanding. No matter who you are or where you come from, I find peace and purpose in understanding others without judgment and learning from others' perspectives. That is perhaps why I've attracted and are attracted to others who are polar opposites to me. I used to be emotionally dependent on others, with huge FOMO and external validation, but I'm doing better. I've had a monumental shift in self-confidence and self-love in the past few years. I feel emotions in its entirety, the good and the bad, and I'm not afraid of vulnerability. I am anxious-attached, wanting to change to secure-attached.

  
**About her:** This is my opinion on her after the three years. This does not reflect her full character, and I want you to form your own perspectives from her quotes and thoughts I will share below. To me, she is a beautifully enigmatic person. Mysterious, with an aura around her that's incalculable, even if you tried to logically untie her being. Mutual friends have called her things; a ""psychopath"", ""cold."" People told me ""don't get too close to her"", and that ""she's dangerous."" She herself has said these things to me too, along with ""I'm intoxicating"", and ""I hurt people because they can leave"", and ""run away now while you still can."" She described herself as a narcissist, self-centered and self-serving. I would describe her as career-oriented, autonomous, and high-functioning. 100% logic, no in-betweens. She ""hates emotions"" and ""hates human beings.""

Very well, let's begin, shall we? **All places and names will be changed, along with minor details, while keeping the main point intact, to protect our identities and boundaries.**

**April 2022 - December 2022 (18 years old):** I met Anna at a music society event in King's College London, she was an exchange student from across the pond in New York University. We talked very little at first, but we hit things off when she invited me to her place for a friend's birthday. The very first night I met her, she talked about her past and traumas (which I won't get into). Whereas others felt it was dark and emotionally shut down, she was laughing about it, all while drinking whiskey. I inquired about it, I was curious, and I wanted to understand her. And she obliged.

>""I thought you're special because you seem pure? But impure at the same time. You understand emotions and that means you also know the worst of people, and yet you still love them and rely on them. You're torturing yourself, you know?""

She left shortly after, back to NYC. She said ""goodbye"", but I promised her ""see you later."" That was the last time I saw her physically, in real life. We got closer since then. We played ping pong, sang karaoke, discussed everything from Nietzsche's philosophy to anime. We got intimate, regularly flirting, and talked NSFW topics. She's highly intelligent, and I started to ""decode her language.""

>""We'll be drinking everyday until the day I die. I miss you.""  
""I'm really intoxicated right now, fuck my life, I'll call you for sure later, just wait for me in bed.""  
""I say 'fuck you' to you a lot, since it means that I actually care when you bring yourself down. If it was someone I was actually angry with, I wouldn't even bother. So my 'fuck you' actually means 'I love you.'""

**January 2023 - September 2023 (19 years old):** I confessed my feelings. I had fallen deeply in love. She told me she'd think about it. **We never put a label on it.** But I waited, and soon I was codependent because of my insecurities. I texted her everyday, wanted her to say 'I love you' to me, and thought futures with her. And enough was enough. She stopped texting me and disappeared.

>""Don't question me by asking if I miss you or not. I wouldn't have said it if I didn't mean it.""  
""You can cry and let your emotions run wild. But you must know it's selfish. It's unbalanced. One person is showing sensitivity while the other is not.""  
""Don't keep on saying 'I love you' and 'I miss you.' If you really love, then show action. Words don't mean anything.""  
""If you want to leave, please do, I'm sorry.""

Months passed with no contact and I spiralled. I ditched my love language of words of affirmation and self-improved. Read Mark Manson and other self-help books. And when I was ready, I texted her again. I told her that I avoided my responsibility for handling my emotions, and that I really wanted to repair what's been broken. ""It's not because I feel like shit, and talking with you will make me feel better. It's not because I want you to help me find solace, it's not because I'm angry with you. It's because you have genuinely been one of the best people who I've ever met."" **She told me before this that she didn't hate me either, and that she sees me as a brother, to even a blood-related extent, and always wants the best for me.** And she replied. And we hit it off again. 

**October 2023 - March 2024 (20 years old):** We got closer again, and she was understanding me too. She started saying ""I love you"" more naturally, without needing me to ask for it. And it was a lot of ""I love you's"" and ""I miss you's"". We played games, watched anime online, and continued on. **She called me her soulmate, someone who understands her really well, and someone who she'll still keep by her side until the day we die, regardless of how bad the times are. She said I was the closest person who'd ever gotten to her heart. She told me I changed her, I admitted she changed me. We ""left imprints"" on each other.** And then she had a brave idea. I was graduating, and so she said stuff to me.

>""Why don't you come to New York City? The work opportunities are better here than in London. We can go drink, you can meet my friends if you want. You can live with me too if you'd like.""

And it clicked. I would move to NYC. But I knew I had to be cautious. I didn't want to repeat my codependency mistake from last time she disappeared. She made that clear, and I respected that. I would move to NYC, not just for her, but for my own personal goals. I've always wanted to live abroad, and I had other friends there too. It made so much sense. I wanted to respect her, and that meant I didn't need her by my side at all times, I wasn't needy like I was before. No need to say 'I love you's' when she doesn't want to. No need for texts everyday, or daily wake up calls. She told me she'd disappear again, cuz' work is getting busy. She was making money, and that's fair. And so she disappeared. And I committed to NYC.

**April 2024 - March 2025 (21 years old):** I'd miss her during this disappearance. But I had to stay strong, at least that's what I thought. I was preparing myself for my future, so I went to the gym, read more books, and financially prepared myself for NYC. So many pivotal moments happened that I wished I could call her about. I graduated, my childhood dog died, I visited her ethnic hometown, but I left it be. She was still seeing my life through my IG stories after all. She was still there. And after months of no contact, she broke it.

>""I don't know if what I'm doing now is right, because I feel like finding you may hurt you. Not saying I'm mostly the one expressing my tiredness, while not being capable to listen to your part makes me feel like shit.""  
""But I do miss talking with you. I think I could only say now, that you have a great time and a better life around you!""

And I felt happy. I didn't grovel and cry at the sight of one text message. I smiled with sincerity. I took a deep breath, and was ready for the new chapter. I was going to see her in NYC. All would be well.

**April 2025 - May 2025:** I arrived at NYC, and found work relatively quickly. She helped me find my footing when I arrived, calling me about where I lived, where I could find jobs, etc. but she made it clear she'd be busy again. So the first two months in NYC were money-making mode. I locked in, and made it clear to myself that somewhere within this year, I'd be with her drinking and doing stuff again. Good things come to those who wait. And finally last week, she called me. But it was a call I wasn't prepared for.

>""I don't feel that way about you anymore. I don't feel romance or sexual attraction to you now.""  
*What? Why are you telling me this now?*  
""Because at the time, even I didn't know that I was feeling those feelings. And afterwards, I was busy.""  
*So you had romantic and sexual attraction to me before? When I was 19 or 20?*  
""Yes, but not now. It took me a year to get over those emotions, the entire year of 2024.""  
*So what are we now then? You told me before we were soulmates, and that I'm a brother to you. You also wanted to be my teacher, you want to teach me forex and investing.*  
*""*We are still all of those things, I believe. Just not romantically or sexually. But yeah, we're soulmates, siblings, teacher/student, close friends, everything.""

I cried and I grieved. I had been building something towards a future I would have with her in NYC. But it was alright, I just had to recalibrate. That's what my logic told me. It's still good to have her as a friend then, she'd still teach me the things she'd told me I'd teach, and we'd still hangout. In fact, she asked to meet me again, so I'll meet her soon. All I had to do was grieve and forget about the romantic aspect, but it's alright, I just had to recalibrate myself. And I was willing to move forward non-romantically.

**29 May 2025 (2 days ago):** I met her physically again. After 1,000 days of distance, I hugged her as tightly as ever. And her being her, she was nonchalant. Aloof. Just a simple, ""Hey, it's been a while. Do you wanna go grab coffee?"" As if the past three years of love, pain, and everything in between hadn't happened to us. I couldn't care less, I was with her. I smiled happily, so let's get some fuckin' coffee! I told myself to live in the moment, and there I was with her. We talked skincare, business, wine, all sorts of everything! It was so damn beautiful. It wasn't the past, it was a new chapter. I was here in the present, and I was ready to move forward. I hugged her again as we parted ways that evening.

**30 May 2025 (Yesterday):** I was happy, but I left unfulfilled. It was a voice in my head that screamed. You need to set your boundaries. You need to be clear and honest with her. She's busy, and she will be busy again. So you need to prepare yourself again. She dropped a big bombshell by telling you she wasn't romantically invested only when you arrived in NYC. You've understood her for the past three years, and the least you could do to support her now and always, is to continue being her friend. It'll all be okay, you've grieved the romantic life you imagined. So I sent a long text message to clear things up.

>*""I've grieved and reflected over what we were and what we are now. I'm not bitter at you, and I don't resent you. I know it's been hard for you too. But I do want to know how I fit into your life now, with the present Anna. We've shifted, and that's okay, but I do feel led on. You told me that we'd do so many things in NYC together. Again, I don't mind this change, but I do need to protect myself from the pain of repeating this again. You hurt me last time we called because it was so sudden that you don't romantically like me anymore. So please help me understand, what does 'us' mean to you in the long-term? What would your ideal relationship with me look like? I'm not at all asking for romantic or sexual hope that you'd change, or promises I can cling onto. I don't want to place expectations on you either, we already had a whole thing about unconditional love that we argued over. You have to do what you do, and that's okay. But so I can prepare, when you say you want to meet me again, is it once a week? Monthly? Yearly? Or dependent on your mood and schedule? When you do have free time, would you want to hangout more often, or fill in the time with busyness and more work? And if you don't have an answer then don't answer. I still love you with all the warmth in my heart, and I want the best for you.""*

And she replied.

>""I made it clear these past few times, and hope I can clear it up one more time. We forever would only be maximum close friends. We love and support each other as close friends. Nothing more than that. Although you always mention how you don't place expectations on me, your words and actions have said otherwise. You placed expectations for 'us' rather than confronting the reality. It shouldn't be my responsibility to take in any position that only one side is interested in. I wanted to give you advice and teaching because I see you as a friend I take dearly. I want to see you succeed in life. It's only because you want and see something more, that's why you're unfulfilled. I don't understand how you think of maintaining unconditional love, when you expect someone that has already moved on to take in your 'unconditional' suffering just because you were romantically invested, and you don't consider your own self-awareness or responsibility. I am happy you came to NYC and all the memories we had, but you cannot expect anyone to grant any promise about anything that you want, that's really naive. Before you want people to understand how they caused pain in your life, please also understand that it's only you who gets to decide the weight of others in your heart, and that's your responsibilty. So don't always tell and make people accept the burden when you haven't thought about how they would feel afterwards. I hope you truly think about what you are doing is really considerate for others, it's basic respect. Even if you have warm, pure and energetic love like a dog, and dogs still will love a person without boundaries, you shouldn't ask why that person doesn't like dogs to respect them. Please don't send these messages if you want to just spam your feelings without considering your words or taking me for granted. I still have my life, and I find it disrespectful when you always put me in a position to take care of your emotions. Just fucking focus on yourself and your future. Don't always put all your time on thinking about someone, you're literally putting yourself below someone else. I already said it clear that many times, if you can't see it through, then we cannot be friends anymore, as it's literally making you stagnant in life. You already know my character, if I wasn't close with you, I would've blocked you long ago.""

**Moving Forward:** And just like that, she's gone again. Disappeared. Like a whisper in the wind. I don't know anymore. I didn't even want to be lovers again. I wasn't emotionally dependent on her, I just wanted some clarity and honesty. After this message, I broke completely. I don't know what is real, and my mind is all over the place. I couldn't sleep at night, and had to take sleeping pills. I know there are two paths I can take now. And one is to spiral like I did many times before, into alcoholism, depression or even worse. **But I cannot do that. I must not do that. I must let her go.** I'll grieve what we were, whatever the fuck it was at this point (friends, soulmates, whatever) but I've already buried all the photos, memories, texts, gifts, and everything in a folder to be remembered but never to be opened again. **Please just tell me your thoughts. I can't trust myself and my emotions at this moment. I'm going insane.**",1,1748665248.0,Healthygamergg,3,0.67,False

1kzobf8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1kzobf8/my_friends_mom_keeps_buying_me_things_and_i_feel/,My friends mom keeps buying me things and I feel bad,"Backstory: I(20F) have a friend, Sam (M,Forever 20) who commited 7 months ago. Him and I were friends (on and off) for around 9 years. I met his mom a few times in middle school as she volunteered to help our class frequently and Sam and I had nearly identical schedules for 3 years until we went to separate high schools. We were mostly online friends, we talked for hours a day for years but only met up a few times (3-4 times over the last 6 years). We both think he had autism and some sort of aspd/npd, and he was a pretty heavy opiate user. I’m diagnosed with bpd. It was a very turbulent friendship, but I absolutely loved him to death and he was very aware of that. It was strictly platonic. I wanted to meet his family, but never pressed it and the fact that we didn’t hang out much meant it wasn’t really weird that I hadn’t. He told me that his mother did not like me because he shit talked me to her and that I’m not allowed in their house. Last October he took his life. He’s attempted in the past (and I always called the cops on him when he did) and so he staged an argument a few days before so that I wouldn’t reach out. That destroyed me. I found out that he passed in a very casual text from a friend (I wasn’t close with his family and we went to separate colleges- but one of my friends is close friends with his moms friend). She texted me “hey, they found Sam’s body last night btw.”  
 
I was absolutely destroyed- obviously. But a few days later that friend reached out to me and told me that Sam’s mom wanted me to have her contact. Alright. I texted her, and we talked a bit and I brought over dinner for her family. We talked for a bit, and she actually did not hate me- and in fact was told that I hated her!! She was so excited to meet me as apparently I was “the only girl Sam ever talked about” and that he discussed me regularly with her. 
 
We set up a coffee date a few weeks later. He was open about his mental health with me, but apparently had never made a singular comment to anyone else about it. Ever. I talked to her and apparently was able to give her some closure. I let her read some of our messages and she told me it really helped. In his note he said some pretty cryptic things and I was the only one who knew what a lot of it meant. She was very thankful for that. I also have a tattoo (that I got post-death) of a quote he said to me regularly (“love u bestie foreva eva”) with his signature. 
 
I reached out and called her pretty regularly to check in on her. We hang out about once a month or so. She REFUSES to let me pay for ANYTHING- so I let her choose what we do and where we go and choose cheap options. She always pressures me to get nicer stuff though, and I can tell it makes her happy so I do. My mom thinks that I’m kinda like the “daughter she never had” (she had a daughter but she passed in childbirth) and I agree- it gives her a sense of normalcy i suppose since she spoiled Sam rotten- I think she just appreciates having that dynamic? I’m not sure. I haven’t asked and I’m not going to. 
 
She took me to bath and body works once and picked out a bunch of stuff for me. She said she was so happy because she loves doing girly things and doesn’t really have anyone to do it with. Pretty much everything we do is girly in some capacity, but I do really enjoy that so I do not mind. 
 
Today she picked me up and we went to Dunkin’. She placed her purse on the table and I did as well. Im visiting home for a day or so so that I can pick up some stuff as I just signed a lease at an apartment 800 miles away. My purse is one I bought for like $5 at goodwill and was originally from Khols and is years old. She pointed at it and told me “I’m not going to let you walk around DC with that thing!” And immediately stood up and told me that we were going to go to TJ maxx. 
 
We got to TJ maxx and spent a while looking at purses. She was so excited and really thoughtfully looked at them. We found one I liked and I took my wallet out and put it in the purse to see if it would fit well, and she saw the wallet (it’s checkerboard denim with fringes, literally the ugliest wallet ive ever seen haha, i got it for $0.45 at Walmart) and told me I needed a new one as well. She noted my shoes (broken crocs) and told me we were replacing that, too. I tried to refuse but she would not let down. I made sure I thanked her over and over. She told me she was happy to do girly things with someone. 
 
We left the store and went back to her car and she handed me a Trader Joe’s Bag (one of the cute ones that’s trending online right now) and said she found it and thought of me. There was a card inside and she told me to open it later. 
 
I opened it when I got home and she put $100 in there and wrote a kind note. I feel so bad 😭😭 I feel like I’m taking advantage of a grieving lady. I don’t know. She’s so sweet and I love hanging out with and talking to her so much. I just don’t want to take advantage of her kindness. ",2,1748665177.0,Vent,2,1.0,False
1kzoa63,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kzoa63,Will I bring eggs home with me? Please help.,"The wealthy elderly woman I care for has roaches.  I’m in the house/kitchen 5 hours a day, cooking and doing meal prep.  

Complaining about these speedy beetles that I see dart back into the darkness of one kitchen cabinet (where food is stored) when I open the door, running up the side of her kitchen cabinet. I’m paranoid about bugs so she might not have indicated the urgency. It’s been 5 months now. 

Her pest control guy came in 3 months ago, found some dead on the floor and assumed he’d seen, identified them & was treating. 

Last week I caught a live one & was able to ID. Now I see adults 10 feet away from the cabinet, all the way across the L shaped countertop, near the kerug coffee machine. 

I’m wiping down these U shaped countertops with paper towels & disinfectant & finding “pepper” on countertops, especially near the sink. 

Then found out her pest guy said he hadn’t seen any bugs in that cabinet. 

He’ll be there tomorrow: I bagged 7 big and small roaches each in a snack sized ziplock . Placed all of them in a gallon ziplock & duct taped it to the inside of the cabinet so he can also see the  “pepper” (feces & eggs) all along the bottom of the cabinet. The last photo I held my phone parallel to the floor. Poor quality, but I think you can still see it. 

Found a live one and finally ID’d. 
Now I’m battling adults on the countertop where the kerug coffee maker is located. 
Found babies crawling out of the cabinet & now tiny babies on the countertop.  

I’m terrified I’ll bring an egg home.
