The DF64 for espresso, bc it has a nice balance of body and clarity as well (there's a orea behind the V60).

It was my first week in college, and I was already lost‚Äîliterally. I had no idea where the damn lecture hall was when she appeared out of nowhere, balancing a coffee in one hand and a half-open book in the other.

""Freshman?"" she asked, smirking.

I nodded.

She pointed down the hallway. ""Take a left, second door. Try not to look so confused.""

I was about to thank her, but she was already walking away.

After that, I kept running into her‚Äîat the library, in the canteen, once even in the pouring rain when she handed me her extra umbrella without a word. She never told me her name, and I never asked. It was easier to pretend we had all the time in the world.

Then, one day, she was just‚Ä¶ gone. I asked around, but no one seemed to know her. No one even remembered seeing her.

Maybe she transferred. Maybe she dropped out. Maybe she never existed at all.Maybe I'm the nothing.

All I know is, I never saw her again.

I can't believe that I am here with Lolita! We are in front of the main entrance waiting for Mr. Marathon Man to do the intermediate running before school. Coach gave Julie a visitors ID for the month which lets her come into the building, drop off her stuff, and shower off the sweat after running. Coach also gave her permission to use her office to get some of her work done because the College Library doesn't open up for a couple of more hours.

Lolita was shocked when I pulled out my accordion on the ferry and played away. Of course, she knew I was doing this but watching it seemed so natural and surreal. And I collected about $20 that goes into the instrument fund for the ACS middle schoolers.

Night the Fam had so much fun listening to Lolita's stories about her 2 months on the road. I had forgotten how funny she is when she does her impersonations! She had us rolling on the floor!

Lolita absolutely hates hotel breakfast she has every day and the coffee they make there. She ate our food truck's ""New York bacon/eggs/cheese on a roll"" and black coffee like it was the greatest culinary achievement in life!",1,1741004035.0,LoHeidiLita,0,1.0,False

They 
haven't lived in the same city for over 5 years now, and keep in contact via text. Last year, he told me he was talking to her about going to Vietnam together for three months. This ended up not happening, but what made me worry about this was he had previously mentioned that they both were interested in one another during high school. Granted, that's a long time ago but it made me feel worried that they wanted to go away for so long together. He had previously told me that he wanted to do that trip with me, and any time we have tried to plan a holiday together, he has dragged his feet a bit, although we usually make it happen in the end. He says that he isn't interested in her and it's not like that, but I can't help but feel insecure about it. He wants to meet her this weekend for coffee and asked me if I'm okay with it, and honestly I'm not but I don't want to be insecure and controlling. We also had a bit of a rocky start to the relationship, with him seeing another girl secretly before we were official. We have talked about this a lot and he has been good since, but it's really hard to let go of the insecurity that it left with me as I will always know that he was or is capable of lying to me. He really has been truly honest and open with me since then however. Any advice would be great.",1,1741004023.0,relationshipproblems,1,1.0,False
1j2hauf,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1j2hauf/me_20m_and_this_girl_20f_have_been_talking_for/,"Me (20M) and this girl (20F) have been talking for about a month but I‚Äôm scared to ruin it, what‚Äôs the next step?","Okay, this is kinda a long one so strap in but I do need some advice please ! I (20M) have been talking to, texting, flirting and hanging out with this girl (20F) and when I tell you we have hit it off I mean home run. She‚Äôs funny, beautiful, smart, her vibe and overall personality is just electric. I‚Äôve known of this girl for a few months as she is my (19F) cousins best friend. But we never really talked until about mid January where things sparked and just continued to grow and grow. Before the question is asked, yes my cousin is okay everything going on with me and her friend. 

Here is where things get tricky this girl was in a relationship that lasted about a year up until the end of January. However, I made it very clear to her that I wouldn‚Äôt lay a finger on her while she was in this relationship. No hand holding no kissing no NOTHING. I barley complimented her, out of respect for that relationship. Now Ik I might look like the bad guy here but her and my cousin attest to the fact that the relationship has ended on her end at least 6 months back. She was over it she was just waiting for a fight so she could leave. Again I know this is kind of dangerous waters and may seem crazy. 

After she left him we started texting a little more here and there and that was the snowball that started to roll. We got to know each other more and more everyday that passed, and we learned that we not only want similar things out of life but also like the same things, foods, jokes, music, we are literally 2 peas in a pod. Constantly flirting and making remarks with each other. We went to SixFlags as a group a week into February where everything was like usual we joked flirted but and the end of the night when I went to drop her off before heading home we talked for about half an hour about how we both felt about each other and made it clear to each other we are in the same page but neither of us want to rush into anything . However we did kiss for the first time that night. I smiled the entire way home and felt something different in me. Things kept heating up a little more from there from late night conversations to a couple make out sessions with one in particular ending with her on my lap. I‚Äôll take this time to make it clear we have not slept with each other which I have no issue with, I‚Äôm not the type of person that depends on that. However it was infinitely clear that we both wanted each other, things continued amazing however about a week ago we hung out went out for breakfast and she mentioned wanting to buy my mom (42F) flowers since I was taking her coffee to her job. Everything went well my mom loved her. When asked about her I refer to her as my friend and she refers to me as her friend again in part to us wanting to take things slow. Especially on her end since she‚Äôs fresh out of a relationship, she doesn‚Äôt want to deal with the rebound comments or look bad to her family. She wants this to be something fresh and healthy for both of us which we agree on . However after that day we had breakfast we had a conversation about slowing down the physical aspects, the kissing and everything else that was happening. I‚Äôm incredibly respectful of that so I agreed and took that step back. We still talk everyday and call every day, flirt and we saw each other a few days ago and even have a plan to get lunch this Wednesday. I‚Äôm just worried that she wanted to slow down everything because she‚Äôs losing interest, I asked her and she said no that‚Äôs not it and that she does still want me and wants to be with me.. she came with me about a week ago now to a family dinner as well and met my sister and stepdad and aunt and uncle. And every I agrees, there is a chemistry between us both and you can see we want each other and everyone loves her. But again, i still refer to her as my friend and she refers to me the same. What‚Äôs the best course of action from here especially with her saying she wanted to slow down physically a few weeks ago?

I totally didn't understand this person until now. So whoever wrote that I will say that there is something going on with the coffee here. Metro Manila to be exact. I didn't get the same symptoms as them but similarly severe.

In my home country I drink coffee regularly and have a strong stomach that processes a range of foods really well. Vietnamese coffee has been the strongest so far. Please don't be worried but If I want to sleep - I will fall asleep to any caffeinated drink. My stomach does not give a flying f. It will just digest it. Staying awake is a choice at this point but drinking caffeine does tend to help when I want to stay awake.

I've had palpitations before but rarely get them. Maybe once in my life.

I ordered a coffee from a nice coffee shop here together with a neighbor. We both experienced strange symptoms the hours following.

The feeling that I had was just an empty weightless feeling. My brain is telling me it's palpitations but they're like psychological palpitations not physical. It's also as if my brain has separated from my body. A mixture of feelings that are mostly direction-less. Like hungry but not really. Sleepy but not really.

They experienced severe palpitations and body aches. I'm feeling slightly better now after a few hours. Similar to my neighbor - I also don't get coffee from coffee shops. I make it at home and never experience any symptoms like this.

I have a feeling it's a local supplier/batch. I'm not saying it's all intentional. But there's something definitely going on. Maybe some new GMO coffee beans?",2,1741003740.0,Philippines_Expats,0,1.0,False

# ***So time is yet now, right here to vote***

*Here are the 5 choices for the month of March!* 

| Title - BTS Connection | Description |
|:-|:-|
| [The Courage to be Disliked by Ichiro Kishimi and Fumitake Koga (2013)](https://www.amazon.com/Courage-Be-Disliked-Phenomenon-Happiness/dp/1668065967) - Yoongi was seen reading this in ITS Season 2 | The Courage to Be Disliked unfolds as a dialogue between a philosopher and a young man, who, over the course of five enriching conversations, realizes that each of us is in control of our life‚Äôs direction, independent of past burdens and expectations of others.| 
| [The Sound Between the Notes by Barbara Probst (2021)](https://www.amazon.com/Sound-Between-Notes-Novel/dp/1647420121) - Recommendation from the book club | Susannah‚Äôs career as a pianist has been on hold for nearly sixteen years, ever since her son was born. An adoptee who‚Äôs never forgiven her birth mother for not putting her first, Susannah vowed to put her own child first, no matter what. And she did. But now, suddenly, she has a chance to vault into that elite tier of ‚Äúchosen‚Äù musicians. There‚Äôs just one problem: somewhere along the way, she lost the power and the magic that used to be hers at the keyboard.|
| [Hurricane Season by Fernanda Melchor (2017)](https://www.amazon.com/Hurricane-Season-Fernanda-Melchor/dp/0811230732) - Recommendation from the book club | The Witch is dead. And the discovery of her corpse has the whole village investigating the murder. As the novel unfolds in a dazzling linguistic torrent, with each unreliable narrator lingering on new details, new acts of depravity or brutality, Melchor extracts some tiny shred of humanity from these characters‚Äïinners whom most people would write off as irredeemable‚Äïforming a lasting portrait of a damned Mexican village.|
| [Before the Coffee Gets Cold by Toshikazu Kawaguchi  (2015)](https://www.amazon.com/Before-Coffee-Gets-Cold/dp/1432899015) - Recommendation from the book club | In a small back alley of Tokyo, there is a caf√© that has been serving carefully brewed coffee for more than one hundred years. Local legend says that this shop offers something else besides coffee‚Äîthe chance to travel back in time. Over the course of one summer, four customers visit the caf√© in the hopes of making that journey. But time travel isn‚Äôt so simple, and there are rules that must be followed. Most importantly, the trip can last only as long as it takes for the coffee to get cold.|
| [The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho (1988)](https://www.amazon.com/Alchemist-Paulo-Coelho/dp/0062315005) - Yoongi once recommended this to ARMY on the BTS fancafe | Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different‚Äîand far more satisfying‚Äîthan he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.|

# A+ Content for a Professional Amazon Look

# Develop a Compelling‚ÄÇBrand Story

Remember‚ÄÇthat customers only buy from trustworthy brands, and a good¬†[brand story](https://amzonestep.com/blog/why-your-amazon-brand-story-matters-more-than-your-product-specs/)¬†can help you differ from the competitors. Using the A+ Content ‚ÄúBrand Story‚Äù‚ÄÇmodule, retailers can communicate their journey, values and mission, creating increases in credibility and emotional connections with shoppers.

# Why It Matters

A¬†[brand story](https://amzonestep.com/blog/why-is-amazons-brand-story-significant-for-your-brand/)¬†establishes trust and makes your brand feel more relatable. If potential customers are clear on‚ÄÇthe vision for your products, they‚Äôre more likely to select your brand than a competitor‚Äôs.

# How to Do It Right

* Begin with‚ÄÇyour mission: Tell us why you started your brand.
* Highlight important milestones: Demonstrate brand achievements‚ÄÇand awards.
* Include genuine images: Share photos from behind the scenes or a‚ÄÇteam introduction.
* Make it short and sweet: Use a few short paragraphs‚Äîaudience-focused, not‚ÄÇyou-focused.

# Example

For example, a sustainable skincare brand that sells‚ÄÇorganic face serums could use A+ Content to provide details about its eco-friendly mission. The of writing off their use of recyclable packaging, a timeline of their journey, and an image of their founder‚ÄÇexplaining why she decided to create clean beauty products.

Telling a story, customers can identify with can create brand loyalty and‚ÄÇlead to conversion. In a world where shoppers are more inclined to support¬†[Amazon FBA brands](https://amzonestep.com/blog/what-amazon-resources-empower-amazon-fba-brands/)¬†they connect with, the Brand Story module is an‚ÄÇinvaluable asset to A+ Content.

# Why Use High Quality Lifestyle Images¬†

Good quality¬†**listing images**¬†are so‚ÄÇimportant to purchase decisions. Whereas product images on‚ÄÇa white background are usual,¬†[lifestyle images](https://amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-the-balance-of-infographics-and-lifestyle-images-in-2024/)¬†that demonstrate real-world usage give customers a sense of how it may fit into their everyday life.

# Why It Matters

Lifestyle images provide context, size and function of‚ÄÇa product, and an emotional connection. Amazon shoppers are more likely to purchase from listings‚ÄÇthat use relatable use-case scenarios.

# How to Do It Right:

* Use some great examples:‚ÄÇShow the product in action.
* Diversity of backgrounds: Pick settings similar to your‚ÄÇaudience.
* Keep high resolution: Clear and professional-looking‚ÄÇimages

Visually highlight the key benefits: Rather than using heavy text to explain product value,‚ÄÇallow¬†**listing images**¬†to do the talking.

# Example

For example, an¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller of yoga mats may include lifestyle images of a person‚ÄÇpracticing on the mat in a studio or at home. Instead of just showing the rolled-up mat, the images can showcase a couple of yoga postures, non-slip grip,‚ÄÇand the comfortable thickness.

Including lifestyle images adds a 3D shopping experience that helps shoppers visualize the product‚ÄÇin their lives. This can result‚ÄÇin increased likelihood of engagement and conversion rates.

# Use Infographics to Highlight Its Key Features¬†

There are also¬†[Amazon infographics](https://amzonestep.com/blog/amazon-infographics/)¬†that get your‚ÄÇproduct benefits across quickly. They pair graphics with short‚ÄÇtext, which make information easier to digest.

# Why It Matters

In‚ÄÇfact, most shoppers don‚Äôt read¬†[product descriptions](https://techcrunch.com/2023/09/13/amazon-debuts-generative-ai-tools-that-helps-sellers-write-product-descriptions/). Just make sure you choose to‚ÄÇhighlight the most important product aspects in an easy and understandable format.

# How to Do It Right

* New design with simple icons and graphics: Show features through visual‚ÄÇrepresentations rather than text only
* Text should be short and‚ÄÇimpactful: Not lengthy descriptions.
* Avoid overusing color contrast: Color contrast is a great way to emphasize certain points‚ÄÇbut pick moments to use it strategically so as not to confuse the viewer.
* So zero in on the headline benefits: things that are most important to‚ÄÇcustomers.

# Example

For‚ÄÇexample, a noise-canceling headphones seller might use an infographic to explain:

* Battery life:‚ÄÇ‚Äú40 hours on a single charge‚Äù followed by an icon of a battery.
* Sound quality: ‚ÄúPremium HD audio,‚Äù with a‚ÄÇspeaker icon
* Bluetooth range:‚ÄÇ‚ÄúSeamless connectivity up to 30 feet‚Äù along with a Wi-Fi signal icon.

Infographics serve as a visual aid‚ÄÇto condense and communicate information clearly. Bringing it‚ÄÇto a more customer-level engagement and higher conversions

# Describes A Comparison Table To Highlight Your Advantages¬†

A comparison chart lets you showcase your product‚Äôs‚ÄÇbenefits over the competition in a straightforward, side-by-side comparison. That helps customers easily see why your‚ÄÇproduct is better.

# Why It Matters

When consumers are‚ÄÇshopping, they often explore many products before they buy. A well-laid-out comparison chart can save them time, and this‚ÄÇcan also sway the decision in your favor.

# How to Do It Right

* Select comparison factors that‚ÄÇmake sense: Decide on the elements that can set your product apart.
* Design with clarity: The less clutter,‚ÄÇthe easier it is to read the information.
* Show your strengths: Always keep your product distinct in the‚ÄÇchart.
* Price vs general market standards ‚Äî no mentioning competitor‚ÄÇproduct names to comply with Amazon policies

A laptop¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller can create a chart:

|**Battery Life**|12 hours|
|**Display**|4K Ultra HD|
|**Weight**|Lightweight (2.5 lbs)|

# Leverage Customer Testimonials and Reviews

Reviews are critical in building trust, and displaying positive testimonials in A+ Content can add further substance to‚ÄÇthe reviews and influence buying decisions. Customers don‚Äôt really trust retailers when they say their products are good, and the social proof factor works in their favor here, especially buying brands‚ÄÇon Earth.¬†

# How to Use Customer Testimonials Effectively

¬†Sellers should not only include them in their product descriptions, but they should also keep in mind to highlight the specific benefits a customer gained from the‚ÄÇproduct according to a review; use reviews from verified buyers for credibility, and present them in a readable way, with¬†**listing images**¬†where possible, print.¬†

* A fitness equipment brand can showcase a testimonial of a customer who lost weight using their treadmill, along with some before and after‚ÄÇimages. Using Positive Reviews‚ÄÇin¬†[A+ Content](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-resolve-a-content-upload-issues-on-amazon-fba/)¬†helps gain more trust from short priced buyers.

# Use‚ÄÇCTA (Call-to-action) Elements

A strong call‚ÄÇto action (CTA) emphasizes what you want the customer to do next, whether that is purchase, sign up for updates, or discover more about the product. Many buyers need some direction before‚ÄÇcompleting a purchase, and a good CTA can change the game.¬†

* In this regard,¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers should make sure that their CTA is action-oriented, with words like ‚ÄúBuy Now,‚Äù ‚ÄúUpgrade Your Experience,‚Äù or ‚ÄúLimited-Time Offer,‚Äù‚ÄÇand that they are placed within the content for the most impact, and mention urgency when possible.¬†
* For instance, an electronics seller might use a‚ÄÇCTA such as ‚ÄúOrder Today and Get Free Shipping‚Äù to motivate customers to buy right away. Effective‚ÄÇCall To Action (CTA) drives better conversion and sales performance.

# Test‚ÄÇYour A+ Content with an A/B Test

Even top A+ Content will likely require some‚ÄÇtweaks to reach peak performance. A/B testing (split testing) is a method where¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers may‚ÄÇuse to compare multiple versions of their content to see which performs better.

¬†Sellers can test various¬†**listing images**, text and layouts to‚ÄÇdetermine what optimizes for higher conversions.¬†

* For sustainable A/B testing, sellers need to modify a single factor at a time, use Amazon‚Äôs ‚ÄúManage Your Experiments‚Äù tool to create A/B‚ÄÇtests if eligible, analyze results relative to engagement and conversion rates, and add any successful elements for the long term.¬†

Such as a skincare brand that tests two versions of A+ Content ‚Äî one featuring‚ÄÇan infographic showcasing top ingredients and the other featuring a before-after comp. If the before-and-after performs better, the Amazon FBA seller can use that as the‚ÄÇfinal product.¬†

The real customer data from A/B testing allows sellers to refine and enhance their listings to engage their targeted audience more effectively and ultimately stimulate‚ÄÇhigher sales.

# Remove Irrelevant Keywords

# Identify Non-Converting Keywords

These keywords‚ÄÇare search terms that generate clicks to an¬†[Amazon listing](https://amzonestep.com/blog/essential-steps-for-amazon-sellers-after-launching-an-amazon-listing/)¬†but result in no purchases. While‚ÄÇthese keywords can get views, if they don‚Äôt convert viewers into buyers, they damage the overall performance of the listing.¬†

To find these‚ÄÇtypes of keywords,¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers can pull Amazon‚Äôs Search Term Report in Seller Central. This report shows you the keywords‚ÄÇpulling in clicks but not purchases.¬†

This means that either there is no intent between these two groups, in which case the target audience is inappropriately defined, or the keyword is not applicable to a huge proportion‚ÄÇof the target audience.

* For instance, let‚Äôs say a seller was‚ÄÇselling luxury leather handbags. If their product is being shown to budget-conscious shoppers without the keyword ‚Äúcheap handbags,‚Äù which filters out the budgeted shoppers, their product is still getting exposure but at the cost of extra ad money spent in vain on‚ÄÇthese shoppers who will never buy an expensive bag.¬†

Other customers will click on the listing, but see the‚ÄÇprice and move on, which can hurt conversion rates. To remedy this, the seller‚ÄÇshould delete ‚Äúcheap‚Äù from its backend search terms and instead optimize for words like ‚Äúgenuine leather handbags‚Äù or ‚Äúdesigner handbag for women.‚Äù

This includes sellers cutting‚ÄÇout ineffective keywords. Both ensure higher conversion and‚ÄÇhigher listing ranking on amazon. A product with a‚ÄÇhigh conversion rate tells Amazon‚Äôs algorithm that it is a relevant and valuable product, and therefore stands a better chance of getting higher placements in search results.

¬†To continue attracting the right customers, sellers need to frequently monitor keyword performance and remove non performing terms to‚ÄÇkeep their listing well optimized.

# Avoid Generic Terms That Lack Buying Intent

Generic‚ÄÇkeywords might get you traffic, but not serious buyers. Searches for ‚Äúbest shoes‚Äù or ‚Äúgood‚ÄÇlaptop‚Äù are too generic and lack the intent of actual buyers. Shoppers looking for those types of terms are often‚ÄÇin the research phase of the buying journey, not necessarily ready to buy.¬†

To boost sales,¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers need to optimize these vague keywords‚ÄÇwith more targeted, high-intent phrases.

* For instance, a seller wants to sell gaming laptops might specify instead of using couch words like ‚Äúgood laptop,‚Äù they might use product-related, purchase intent keywords such as ‚Äúhigh-performance‚ÄÇgaming laptop‚Äù or ‚Äúlaptop with RTX graphics card.‚Äù These‚ÄÇphrases appeal to buyers who are already aware of their needs, making them the conversion-catalyst step.

Most of all, Amazon‚Äôs search algorithm favors listings that‚ÄÇmatch a customer‚Äôs intent to buy.¬†

* For example, if an¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller uses generic keywords they may have their listing display in search‚ÄÇresults for unrelated questions which results in less engagement and fewer sales.) Moreover, popular keywords are‚ÄÇalso highly competitive and smaller sellers will often find it difficult to compete with established brands.

Instead of going after generic keywords, sellers‚ÄÇshould conduct keyword research to identify terms that mirror customer intent. Amazon FBA sellers can fine-tune keyword strategy based on intent-based search terms to improve their relevant listing and‚ÄÇattract the target ready-to-purchase customers for sales.

# Eliminate Keywords Which Mislead the Customer About the Product

Using ambiguous language in Amazon product descriptions will result in the wrong buyers getting interested which produces higher rates of returns as well as bad reviews that decrease page position.¬†

Each keyword in your¬†[Amazon listing](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-small-amazon-listing-tweaks-can-lead-to-big-sales/)¬†should precisely depict the product‚Äôs characteristics as well as technical details. The use of incorrect terms by¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers attracts faulty customers who end up unsatisfied with their purchase when reality differs from expectations.

* When a wired gaming mouse includes the search term ‚Äúwireless‚Äù in its listing it will appear in results for wireless mouse queries. Customers who seek a wireless option will likely click the listing for a Bluetooth-enabled product.¬†

Customers will usually provide poor feedback or choose item return or non-purchase after they discover the product uses wires. The user experience deteriorates while the algorithm receives signals that indicate the listing does not match the search terms.

Sellers should conduct consistent keyword checks and remove terms which fail to accurately represent their products. Sellers need to concentrate on showing their products‚Äô real specifications rather than attempting to reach broad consumer groups.¬†

Sellers who use proper keywords in an authentic way establish customer loyalty and boost sales because their targeted customer base effectively discovers appropriate products.

# Eliminate Outdated or Seasonal Keywords

Seasonal keywords function excellently during targeted periods yet destroy visibility after seasons conclude. The market value of keywords tagged to event-specific listings decreases when such events finish.¬†

* For example holiday items like ‚ÄúChristmas gift for kids‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlack Friday deals‚Äù put specific keywords into disuse. Product listings that contain obsolete search terms will receive lower search rankings from Amazon‚Äôs system because they attract customers who are no longer interested.

During cold months sellers of winter coats market their products using the keyword ‚Äúbest winter jackets for extreme cold‚Äù. When season transitions take place the total number of customers searching for winter jackets declines.¬†

The visibility of a listing declines when¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers neglect to update their key phrases which impacts its ability to attract suitable traffic. The sellers should shift their search phrases toward ‚Äúlightweight spring jackets‚Äù and ‚Äúwindproof jackets for spring‚Äù which better match contemporary consumer interests.

Physical store success depends on continuous monitoring of market trends followed by keyword adjustments. By analyzing data from search volume tools such as Google Trends and Amazon the seller can spot declining popular seasonal keywords and make needed updates in their listings.

¬†Strategic updates to keywords help maintain product usability so it attracts customers throughout the entire year.

# Eliminate Irrelevant Brand Names

Listing keywords that include competitor brand names may seem‚ÄÇlike a way to bring in more traffic, but it may have the opposite effect. Amazon‚Äôs guidelines restrict¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers from including another brand name in their own backend search‚ÄÇterms ‚Äî list abuse on this count could see listings suppressed or penalized.¬†

* For example, if a seller is selling generic wireless earbuds, having words like ‚ÄúApple AirPods‚Äù or ‚ÄúBose headphones‚Äù in the backend keywords may help bring shoppers who are looking for those brands.¬†

When customers receive these products and see they‚ÄÇare not Apple or Bose products, they may feel tricked and post a review. This damages the listing‚Äôs credibility‚ÄÇand also raises returns.

* Sellers should emphasise what sets their products apart instead of competitor names. If the earbuds come with features like noise cancellation or long battery life, keywords such as ‚Äúnoise-canceling wireless earbuds,‚Äù and ‚Äúlong-lasting Bluetooth earbuds‚Äù will‚ÄÇdraw the right audience without any confusion.¬†

Transparency is key in both ensuring compliance with Amazon‚Äôs policies and maintaining trust‚ÄÇand satisfaction with your customers.

# Remove Unnecessary Synonyms and Repetitive Keywords

[Amazon‚Äôs A9 algorithm](https://amzonestep.com/blog/how-to-feed-amazon-a9-algorithm-during-product-launch/)¬†automatically takes different‚ÄÇversions of keywords into account, so there is no need to build out 100 synonyms for keywords or repeat keywords excessively. Stuffing backend search terms‚ÄÇwith similar words occupies precious real estate that could be used for more relevant keywords.

* So for instance, a seller listing a ‚Äúwaterproof hiking backpack‚Äù doesn‚Äôt have to add all of those‚ÄÇvariations like ‚Äúhiking backpack waterproof,‚Äù ‚Äúwaterproof backpack for hiking,‚Äù and ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs All About a backpack hiking waterproof.‚Äù Amazon already knows‚ÄÇthese are related terms.

¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers will need to leverage other relevant keywords, such as ‚Äúlightweight‚ÄÇtrekking backpack‚Äù or ‚Äúdurable outdoor backpack,‚Äù to increase their opportunities.

But on the other side, if your listing‚ÄÇis repetitive, it is too spammy. Instead of repeating ‚Äúbest laptop for students,‚Äù sellers should‚ÄÇuse alternatives, including ‚Äúaffordable student laptop‚Äù or ‚Äúlightweight college laptop.‚Äù The‚ÄÇwell-planned and clean keyword strategy follows an optimized approach for making the listing visible without disturbing the user flow.

# Eliminate Poorly Performing PPC Keywords

[Amazon Pay-Per-Click (PPC](https://amzonestep.com/blog/mastering-amazon-ppc-strategies-for-maximizing-your-advertising-roi/))‚ÄÇcampaigns help you understand keyword performance ‚Äî as in, which keywords convert sales and which do not. PPC performance reports should be checked regularly,‚ÄÇand poorly performing keywords should be removed from listings.¬†

If these keywords see a lot of clicks but fail to result in sales, they can sour both organic rankings and‚ÄÇadvertising ROI.

* For example, if a¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller places‚ÄÇan advertisement for ‚ÄúBluetooth speakers in $30‚Äù that receives a very high click-through-rate, but not conversion, then obviously the expectation for the product does not match customer expectation.¬†
* Targeting this keyword creates wasted spend, and minimizes profitability‚ÄÇon the whole. Instead, more effective search keywords for the seller to use might include phrases like ‚Äúcompact wireless speakers ‚Äù or ‚Äúbudget-friendly Bluetooth speakers‚Äù which better reflect what customers‚ÄÇare searching for.

This can significantly enhance their sales performance as removing low-performing PPC keywords and concentrating on high-converting terms can‚ÄÇimprove the efficiency of paid campaigns and boost organic search ranking.

Some keywords‚ÄÇare strictly prohibited by Amazon guidelines. While creating their content, sellers must ensure‚ÄÇnot to use restricted terms like false claims, medical benefits, prohibited product descriptions, etc.

* For example, a seller of supplements may not use‚ÄÇwords such as ‚Äúcures arthritis‚Äù or ‚Äúguaranteed weight loss‚Äù because Amazon allows medical claims only with F.D.A. approval. Gen-y does not allow the use‚ÄÇof promotional language in listings, so words like ‚Äúfree shipping‚Äù or ‚Äúbest price‚Äù should not be part of backend search terms, either.

# Optimize for Amazon SEO Algorithm Updates

# Focus on High-Intent Keywords

Amazon algorithms A9 and A10 position listings which match specified buyer intent criteria because these terms indicate readiness to make purchases. Sellers achieve better visibility and conversion rates through their efforts on high-intent keyword selection.¬†

The consumer seeking ‚Äúbest waterproof Bluetooth speakers for beach use‚Äù requires a particular product which must provide both durability and portability features.¬†

* The use of search keywords such as ‚Äúwaterproof Bluetooth speakers for beach‚Äù strengthens the probability that buyers will discover the product while searching for purchasing options at the beach.
* Through the use of special search tools¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers can select appropriate long-tail keywords that match their targeted customers‚Äô precise search needs. Products should use specific descriptions such as ‚Äúbest portable waterproof Bluetooth speaker for travel‚Äù instead of generic terms ‚ÄúBluetooth speaker.‚Äù

A natural readable flow throughout the listing must be maintained at all times. The use of excessive repeating keywords through keyword stuffing destroys both the readability along with the customer‚Äôs overall experience between seller and buyer.¬†

Refining your product list to meet search engine requirements must not overshadow creating a valuable experience for prospective buyers so you need to strike a careful measure. Targeting high-intent essential terms helps sellers find suitable audience matches and improves both product visibility and conversion chances.

# Prioritize Backend Keywords for Better Indexing

The search engine of Amazon uses Backend keywords as secret terms which make products searchable. The algorithm relies on these secret keywords which the product page does not reveal to find matching search queries.¬†

The strategic use of backend keywords enables massive visibility growth though sellers need to implement them properly.

Amazon supports 250 backend search terms yet¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers should prevent duplicate keywords from title content as well as bullet points and product description content. Including ‚Äúwireless headphones‚Äù within the product title makes further inclusion of this phrase in backend keywords unnecessary.¬†

* A seller should focus on putting related terms and variations within backend search terms. A product such as Bluetooth headphones requires backend keywords including ‚Äúnoise-canceling Bluetooth earphones,‚Äù ‚Äúover-ear wireless headphones,‚Äù and ‚Äúwireless stereo headphones for working out‚Äù to maximize search query coverage.
* Sellers commonly make the error of including excessive irrelevant keywords within their search term backend. The use of terms such as ‚Äúbest‚Äù or ‚Äúcheap‚Äù typically proves useless because they conflict with Amazon‚Äôs system guidelines and trigger algorithmic detection.¬†

The search system on Amazon identifies equivalent words and phrases therefore Amazon FBA sellers do not need to use the same term repeatedly to rank their products. Each backend search term should include different specific phrases which will expand the potential for appearing in additional search results.

Exploring an appropriate set of backend keywords allows sellers to boost their product discovery levels while following Amazon‚Äôs platform regulations. The improved indexing ability lets sellers get ranked for multiple relevant search inquiries.

# Optimize Product Titles with a Balance of Keywords and Readability

[Amazon listings](https://amzonestep.com/blog/ultimate-guide-to-a-b-testing-your-amazon-listings/)¬†receive their main performance boost from the product title which stands as a crucial element in their rankings. The combination of targeted keywords with text that customers can easily understand produces superior rankings and click-through rates (CTR) in an efficient title.¬†

Both appropriate keywords and simple readable customer-engaging content need to exist in one title. Amazon provides limited character count for titles yet¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers should maximize their word choice in this space. The optimal title for a wireless vacuum cleaner should appear as follows:

**‚ÄúXYZ Cordless Vacuum Cleaner ‚Äì 22 Kpa Suction Power, Lightweight, 2-in-1 for Home & Car Use‚Äù**

* The product title sneaks in essential keywords ‚Äúcordless vacuum cleaner‚Äù plus ‚Äúsuction power‚Äù and ‚Äúlightweight‚Äù yet adds useful information about being ‚Äú2-in-1 for home & car use‚Äù to attract prospective customers.¬†

The title combines customer-oriented problem areas with essential features to create both visibility and product value communication.

Repeated use of keywords should be avoided in title content because it leads to clumsy and unappealing texts.¬†

The addition of excessive repeated words like ‚Äúbest vacuum cleaner‚Äù and ‚Äúpowerful vacuum cleaner‚Äù within the title does not enhance search rankings since it generates confusion in both readability and comprehension. Place vital keywords and product characteristics into the text in a natural way.¬†

# Engaging and Emphasizing the Bullet‚ÄÇPoints for Optimization

The‚ÄÇBullet Points ‚Äì This section of an Amazon listing is an opportunity to get in the features and benefits of a product, so this is an area to focus strongly on optimization.

¬†Not only is this a crucial aspect of Amazon‚Äôs ranking algorithm, but the bullet points are also directly visible to customers, so they must be keyword-optimized as well‚ÄÇas persuasive.

When forming bullet points a good practice is to‚ÄÇoptimize them one by one concentrating from the beginning on the points that initially come to the head of product selling.¬†

Some of these can be size, color,‚ÄÇdurability, material, end use, etc. For instance, selling a‚ÄÇwaterproof backpack, bullet points should immediately communicate what makes that product special:

* Waterproof ‚Äì Completely waterproof with sealed zippers to keep‚ÄÇyour things safe in any climate
* It holds a 15‚Äù laptop and‚ÄÇhas lots of compartments to keep you organized.
* Durable Materials ‚Äì Constructed from‚ÄÇheavy-duty, abrasion-resistant fabric for durability.

You can also include relevant keywords in the bullet points that‚ÄÇhelp the algorithm understand what the product is and match it to customer searches.

* The keywords ‚Äúwaterproof design‚Äù and ‚Äúheavy-duty fabric,‚Äù for example,‚ÄÇmight be associated with high-intent searches such as ‚Äúwaterproof backpack for hiking.‚Äù

# Improve Your‚ÄÇProduct Descriptions with Long-Tail Keywords

As a result, Amazon‚Äôs search algorithm is‚ÄÇskewed heavily towards long-tail keywords, with more specific customer intent.

* And while broad keywords like ‚Äúcoffee maker‚Äù might generate general traffic, long-tail keywords like ‚Äúbest coffee maker for small kitchens‚Äù or ‚Äúeasy-to-use single-serve coffee maker‚Äù can help sellers bring in more qualified traffic and increase‚ÄÇconversions.

Long-tail keywords are usually less competitive which makes it a better chance for new or‚ÄÇniche products to appear on top of the search results. Sellers can now target more niche searches with many relevant long-tail phrases‚ÄÇscattered throughout their product description and not compete with larger, more established listings.

* A¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†seller selling a smart thermostat, though, can use long-tail keywords such as ‚Äúenergy-efficient‚ÄÇsmart thermostat for large homes,‚Äù ‚ÄúWi-Fi capable smart thermostat for Alexa‚Äù and ‚Äúprogrammable thermostat with voice control.‚Äù¬†

These phrases appeal to different kinds of customers, whether they want energy-saving features, compatibility with‚ÄÇsmart devices or straightforward programming. But do‚ÄÇmake sure not to go overboard with stuffing¬†[Amazon keywords](https://amzonestep.com/blog/5-things-you-need-to-know-to-master-amazon-keywords/).¬†

# Get More Customer‚ÄÇReviews and Keep Ratings High

Customer‚ÄÇreviews are one of Amazon‚Äôs most important ranking algorithm factors. The more positive reviews a product has, the higher it is likely to rank in search results, as‚ÄÇpositive reviews are indicators of trust and quality.

¬†Vendors need to keep gathering more reviews while maintaining high ratings‚ÄÇin order to improve the ranking.

* Fortunately there are‚ÄÇa number of techniques that will help you request reviews without running afoul of Amazon‚Äôs rules. One way to go is to utilize Amazon‚Äôs Request a Review button, which sends customers a standardized email asking‚ÄÇfor feedback on their order.

¬†Sellers can also request a review in their follow-up‚ÄÇemails in a friendly way. For example, once a product has been delivered,‚ÄÇyou might say something as simple as:

* ‚ÄúWe Hope you‚Äôre enjoying your new product! We appreciate reviews to help us improve and serve‚ÄÇbetter.‚Äù

That would be Amazon Vine, where trusted reviewers can obtain free products in exchange for honest‚ÄÇreviews ‚Äì just another method to garner some reviews. Positive reviews enhance the‚ÄÇreputation of the product, which not only raises rankings but also builds trust in potential customers.

Keeping high ratings‚ÄÇis also essential. If you have a negative review,‚ÄÇdo something about it and try to resolve your customer‚Äôs problem. Handling negative feedback professionally demonstrates to potential buyers that the seller is considerate regarding consumer complaints,‚ÄÇimproving both reviews and conversion rates.

# Optimize For‚ÄÇMobile Search And Voice Search

Mobile is where the brand is: Over 60% of Amazon shoppers shop and‚ÄÇbuy on mobile. Optimizing for mobile search correlates to increased visibility and conversion, making this one‚ÄÇof the most important aspects of optimizing listings.¬†

MOBILE FRIENDLY: Listings must render quickly and use crisp, high resolution listing images with short‚ÄÇbullet points and descriptions.

Ease of navigation and readability are‚ÄÇkey here, especially for mobile users, as they are frequently on the road. This includes making bullet points scannable and making‚ÄÇsure that the most compelling features (and evidence) are front loaded.¬†

Most mobile users want fast access to‚ÄÇinformation, so don‚Äôt use extended paragraphs that could overwhelm or confuse potential buyers.

* Amazon‚Äôs Alexa is also popularizing another major trending‚ÄÇtopic: voice search. With the increasing usage of voice‚ÄÇcommands for customers to search products, it becomes crucial to optimize for voice search. Voice queries‚ÄÇare often more conversational, so you‚Äôd want to focus on natural language.¬†

However, instead of targeting ‚Äúblender‚Äù, a voice search keyword might be ‚ÄúWhat is the best blender‚ÄÇfor smoothies?‚Äù

For voicing search optimization, encompass vocals that are: nearest for how‚ÄÇpersons speak. This strategy increases visibility in voice-activated queries, so you want your product to show up when someone asks Alexa for‚ÄÇrecommendations.

# Improve Click-Through Rates (CTR) with Compelling Images and Pricing Strategies

Click-through rate‚ÄÇ(CTR) is an important factor in the Amazon ranking algorithm. Search algorithms favor items with a high‚ÄÇclick-through rates (CTR). Sellers must improve the¬†[Amazon CTR](https://amzonestep.com/blog/what-factors-are-influencing-your-amazon-ctr/)¬†by working out high-quality listing images and attractive pricing ways.

An image is the first aspect your‚ÄÇcustomer gets to see while scrolling through a search result. Engagement for‚ÄÇa listing with high-resolution listing images showing the product from different angles are much higher.¬†

* For instance, if selling a coffee maker, include photos of‚ÄÇthe product in action, close-ups of its most important features, and lifestyle shots that help customers visualize the item in their own kitchens.

Another key‚ÄÇconsideration is price. If you can make the price and/or offer (bundling products for a discount, etc.) more competitive, this will help improve CTR rates by encouraging potential buyers to click‚ÄÇon your listing.

* Promotions, such as limited-time discounts, can‚ÄÇalso be used by¬†**Amazon FBA**¬†sellers to create an urgency among customers. For instance, ‚ÄúSave 20% for a limited time‚Äù can stimulate visitors to click‚ÄÇto buy. If you stay on top‚ÄÇof competitor prices, you can regularly adjust your price based on this.

This means one can send a positive signal to Amazon‚Äôs‚ÄÇalgorithm to rank their product higher for better visibility to drive sales.

# Keep Track of Performance‚ÄÇand Adjust to Algorithm Changes

Amazon algorithm‚ÄÇlike A9 and A10 is constantly evolving so sellers must stay updated with changes. Sellers need to adapt their strategies when search ranking factors change, so regularly monitoring performance allows them to do just‚ÄÇthat.

There are multiple tools to measure listing performance, such as‚ÄÇAmazon Seller Central, Brand Analytics, and third-party tools.

They help sellers measure keyword ranks, conversion rates,‚ÄÇand overall listing health. You can analyze keywords and check if there is any product feature or feature that is still‚ÄÇunable to bring on traffic.

# Try Buy One, Get One (BOGO) Promotions for Amazon Listings

One of the simple yet powerful approaches‚ÄÇwhen it comes to promotion is a Buy One Get One (BOGO) promotion that works well to increase Amazon sales and drive customer actions.¬†

This is a super great offer for both a typical first time‚ÄÇbuyer and every repeat customer, where one is getting some free offer on a purchase if the product qualifies the offer.

¬†If done correctly, BOGO promotions can help you gain better product exposure, acquire a higher customer base to purchase‚ÄÇyour product and help you attain greater sales ‚Äî an indispensable weapon for the Amazon seller.

# The‚ÄÇEffectiveness of BOGO Promotions on Amazon

Deals are in an Amazon shopper‚Äôs DNA, and while BOGO makes sense functionally, it‚ÄÇalso plays into the instinct to make a beeline for the deal that provides immediate value.¬†

The idea of getting something extra for free or at a discount and completing the purchase resonates well with‚ÄÇshoppers. That sense of extra value often leads‚ÄÇclients to make larger purchases than they originally intended.

The competition on Amazon is fierce and if you can add a BOGO that‚ÄÇmight set your product apart from the competition. This is a deadline-oriented way of selling‚ÄÇthat can increase the conversion of visitors to buyers.¬†

Buy One, Get One Free ‚Äî This model appeals especially to the compatible consumer, who wants to get the most out of the‚ÄÇcheckout process.¬†

* For example, if a shopper was only planning on buying one product,‚ÄÇbut sees that they can receive a second, free of charge, they are more likely to make the purchase.

Additionally, BOGO‚ÄÇoffers can increase Average Order Value (AOV) and encourage repeat purchases. And if shoppers are able to find the exact item they were looking for,‚ÄÇthey may even feel more fulfilled by their purchase, leading to positive¬†[product reviews](https://amzonestep.com/blog/7-ways-to-provide-product-reviews-on-amazon/), and greater customer retention.

# How to Set Up a BOGO Promotion on Amazon

Setting up‚ÄÇa BOGO on Amazon is a simple and straightforward process via Amazon Seller Central. So, here is a guideline about‚ÄÇhow to go-about implementing it.

* Log into Seller Central, Click on‚ÄÇPromotions Tab:
* Navigate to the Advertising tab in Seller‚ÄÇCentral
* From the drop-down choose promotions and click on‚ÄÇcreate new promotion.

# Select the BOGO Offer Type

Click on the appropriate ‚ÄúBuy one, Get one‚Äù promo‚ÄÇtype There are different types of promotions with amazon, so please go ahead and choose the one that suits‚ÄÇyour needs.

# Define Promotion Criteria

Configure the products that‚ÄÇyou want to offer with this BOGO promotion. Choose the promotional Buy One Get‚ÄÇOne type (e.g., a second item free or a second item at a given percentage discount), and supply any exclusions or limitations. You can simply apply it on selected‚ÄÇcolors or sizes of a particular item ‚Äî say, a BOGO.

# Set the Promotional Dates

Pick your promotion date range‚ÄÇfor start and end dates.¬† In the case of BOGO deals, the absence of a time frame makes it difficult for the consumers to realize the urgency and act swiftly, well, a definite timeline‚ÄÇrectifies that.

¬†It may make sense to latch the promotion to a big shopping event, such as Prime Day,¬†[Black Friday](https://amzonestep.com/blog/whats-the-secret-to-winning-the-amazon-black-friday-battle/)¬†or Cyber Monday when traffic is‚ÄÇup.

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


#### **1. Airports, Laminar - What We Call Home EP [Selfreleased]**  
*Recommended if you like: Mazare, SadBois, Blink 182*  

Remember back in November 2024, when [I demanded](https://redd.it/1goqvqp/) more collaborative Laminarsterpieces from extremely underrated British producer **Laminar** and Australian Pop-Punk-EDM multi-talent **Airports**? Well, look what I apparently just manifested! While I won't go back into Kian ""Laminar"" Kasler's backstory, since you can already read all about him [in our previous feature](https://redd.it/10dd0dc/), I think that still leave us with...

**1.1. Airports**  

SYD down, Air-pour yourself some tea, it's storytime.

**1.1.1. Northie From Down Southie**  

While his father, a succesful Country/Rock'n'Roll musician in his own right, certainly instilled a certain love of music into him, young Aaron Lee North's tastes quickly deviated from this starting point when he discovered, and subsequently fell in love with Michael Jackson's music. From there on out, he knew he too wanted to call the stage his home and started playing Bass, Guitar, and even a bit of Drums in various bands, from Blink-182 cover bands to wholly original creations, before starting to dip his feet into the wild world of Hip-Hop. _That_ lead him to turntablism and DJing in general, eventually driving him into the warm arms of electronic music. Equipped with a set of decks that his parents bought him, he started learning how to DJ, until even that became too easy and he started learning how to create his own tunes as well. 

At 18, he started challenging his Christian upbringing by surrounding himself with all sorts of sins, and even defied his inherently emo nature a bit, by starting to play out electronic dance music in clubs, festivals, and, well, Christian events as **Northie**. By 2009, even the internet got a taste of the madness, with the release of his first Electro House EP, _Moppets_. Even though he was mostly exploring the EDM spheres with his productions, you could still hear the Pop Punk and Emo love shine through, whether on the production, through his vocals or through tongue-in-check track titles like _""I Met You On Omegle""_. While things were going rather well for him, with _Open Mixmag_ praising him to high heavens and multiple placements on TV, from MTV to even Big Brother, to the point that even _Ed Solo_ and _Drumsound & Bassline Smith_ were seeking out his talents for remixes, the urge to perform in a band eventually took a hold of him again. 

**1.1.2. Prepaaron for Leeft-off**  

To satisfy the cravings, Aaron sat down with his mate Nathan ""Mossy"" Moss and formed the band duo **Airports**! Things weren't necessarily straight-up Pop-Punk though, the electronic influences and styles were still always very present, especially on the early 2013 demos like _Stellar_ or _Hurricane_. For a while, both projects ran concurrently, as Airports was just supposed to be side project, but eventually, the project was turned into a solo venture and took over his musical career entirely. Sure, he was also still occasionally featuring as a vocalist, like on _Avenir_'s _Dreamers_, but from his 2016 debut EP _Human Things_ on, Aaron would start showing the world what kind of Sad Trap, Bouncy Bangers, Future Bass, and catchy Pop hybrids he was capable of concocting. 

Over the years, while battling a genetic life-changing blood disease mind you, he wouldn't just build up a rather incredible (Air)portfolio of emotionally gripping, deeply personal, dance-music-infused tunes, he would also work with the likes of _OWV_, _Rocket Girls 101_, J-Pop star _Arashi_ and many more, and take part in award-winning projects for big boi brands like Coca-Cola. Through his work on Arashi's _One Love Reborn_, he's even become a multi-platinum producer! Plus, he's started the _ The Human Things_ Podcast with his good friend and early supporter _Bryce Campbell_, on which they detail the various struggles Aaron has faced across his entire life - which is how I've got quite a few of these infos by the way (many thanks!)! 

**1.1.3. Aaround The World**  

Going through his discography, you can certainly feel a shift towards full-blown Pop Punk in the last couple of years, with even more focus on Aaron's wonderful storytelling, songwriting and singing, while still incorporating influences from the wider world of electronic music. For instance, his excellent 2022 EP _For My Youth_, while rather poppy, still had those moments of Trap-y breakdowns, and his _Everything We Know_ five-tracker from earlier this year even incorporates genres like Breakbeat or switches vibes entirely like on _BLOODRUSH_, but my favourite had got to be his 2023 secret Laminar collaboration and full-blown DnB hybrid, _NEED U HERE_. This variety didn't just lead to him finally performing in the UK late last year, radio stations like _George FM_, _ZM_, _Triple J_, _Kiss FM_, and _BBC Radio 1_ also fell in love with him, with _Kerrang! Radio_'s Alex Baker calling his music _""impossibly good""_. Now, he returns to the D and the B, with a brand new EP, once again featuring the only **Laminar** on production duties. 

**1.2. What We Call Home EP**  

While I wouldn't have minded a quicker turnaround for this new **What We Call Home** four-tracker, the absolute _stunner_ that is the opening title track made all the wait so damn worth it. I could _bathe_ in these massive explosions of pure euphoria in the buildup. While already amazing, things only _really_ get going once Aaron jumps on the incredibly uplifting self-rediscovery vocals, and with a swift chant, we are thrown into a gorgeous mix of beautiful guitar strumming, powerful drums and exhilerating synths - I _love_ this so much. Follow-up **The Afterglow** takes this raw, incredibly catchy Pop Punk aesthetic full of super hype guitars and live drum action, and seamlessly blends it with leads made up futuristically fluttery synth quivers, and more electronic tropes like the brief pull-back before bringing the drop back in with its full force. 

Switching from bubblegum synths to fuck-off Emo Punk energy, **Fade Away** not only brings in a darker atmosphere and heavier guitar work, this third stop's drop also unleashes massively destructive, roaring waves of bass and extra high-energy, extra hectic, extra break-y drums, leaving only devastation in its wake. After this outburst, closer **Won't Sleep** sees Aaron turns inwards for his most introspective performance yet, with the production turning up the Pop Punk factor twentyfold once these darkest reflective thoughts come to light, by launching a whole-out guitar-based Dancefloor avalanche that will get you screamin' _and_ skankin'.

**1.3. Conclusion**  

At times dazzlingly beautiful, at times emotionally and sonically in-your-face, but always _the_ perfect symbiosis of Pop Punk and DnB. I love all of this so much.

#### **2. Various Artists - Nomos I üíé [SubCulture Recordings]**  
*Recommended if you like: The Dutch Underground*  

Just in time for the colourful _Carnaval_ celebrations, let's take a look at some perhaps less flashy, but all the more bright talents from the Netherlands' underground. Compiled by the wonderful people at **SubCulture Recordings**, and in contrast to their more experimental _Physis_ EPs, the new **Nomos** various artistry series aims to showcase the most uniquely fine-tuned atmospheric work that the Dutch _Hidden Gems‚Ñ¢Ô∏è_ have to offer, while still providing plenty of joy for the Dancefloor. Let's take a look!

**2.1. Seven-Headed - Schim**

First up, we've got Groningen-based young'un Matthijs Van Kouteren, better known as **Seven-Headed**, once again providing the goods. We've already [discussed this enigmatic figure's origin story a few months back](https://redd.it/1dnbnf7/), so I'll just cut to the status-less chase: **Schim** entrances anyone who dares to listen with an atmosphere so heavily reverberating in our skulls and vocals so creepily whispering that you begin to forget your surroundings, until we _wake up_ to the even deeper, even darker sonics rearing their seven heads in an even more cavernous environment, bound to the rhythm of smoothly flowing breaks. Schimpressive work!

**2.2. Yannons, Kragar - Move To The South**

We continue with two more Groningen-based talents, **Yannons** and **Kragar**! 

Even at a very early age, Yannick **Yannons** Onstenk had already been infatuated with all sorts of groove-focused music, from J Dilla hip-hop beats to Mall Grab techno, so when his mate's older brother took them to _""this cool party with weird music""_, i.e. one of _Noisia_'s local _Machtig_ events, it only made sense he'd fall in love with the weirdly rhythmic world of (drum and) bass music showcased at the infamous night. Around 2013, his friends and him grew weary of DJing to a non-existant crowd, so they went ahead and found a small club they could play their hearts out at, which soon after turned into a full-blown event series, called **Bassface**! While growing the brand to the staple of the Groningen scene that it is today, with their recent events even being hosted at the legendary _Simplon_, Yannick also sought to elevate his artistry further, and started creating his own groovy music. 

From 2021 on, these deeply rumbling machinations of his started appearing on _Transparent Audio_, on which he quickly became a vital part of their roster, but over the years we would also see him represent on the likes of _Ekou_, _Engage_, _Midas Touch_, and _MO7_, not just tearing up the Dutch scene but also making his UK debut last year, and collaborating with other talents like _Koax_, _Geostatic_, _Dava_, _Spektiv_, _Bluejay_, and, well...

... **Krager**! Remember when I said Yannick and his mates started Bassface in the previous paragraph? Tim de Vries, aka Krager, is one of those friends! That's basically all I know about him as well, so let's just jump into their newest collaborative effort, **Move to the South**. Wave after wave, the duo unleashes the eventually all-encompassing basses onto us, while a sharp drum loop pushes us forward, the massive kicks thump their heart out and the spacious atmospheric sonics put us into a haze, forming a truly moody as hell vibe and a half!

**2.3. Vaces - Wazig**  

We stay in Groningen, or at least its general area, with Ruben Vaatstra, better known as **Vaces**! Not only has Ruben seen a lot of success in the DJing department, from his first place win in the _Kunstbende Young Creators Festival_'s DJ category to various sets for _Bass Embassy_ supporting names like _Trinist_, the production of the 20-year-old talent is arguably even more impressive. Across various bootlegs of anyone from _Lana Del Ray_ to _Fred Again.._, Ruben's Vaces project has explored Trance, Gabber, Techno, UK Garage, and, luckily, Drum and Bass, and together with Rutger van Lieshout he even started the very lovely **Bloumme** alias last year, but his finest solo work so far has got to be his self-released _Faced_ EP from last year. No wonder SubCulture snatched him up for his label debut on here! Said debut, **Wazig**, wastes little time, throwing us right into continously rolling, hazy vibes full of snippy bits chiming in and bass occasionally peaking through, with beautiful melodies and some truly tasty textured basses joining in later on. Sick!

**2.4. Lian Feldd - Mana**  

Lastly, we jump on over to the world's most lovely city, Utrecht, to take a look at what Julian van Ginkel, perhaps better known as **Lian Feldd**, has been cooking up! After getting his start into production in the worlds of Hip-Hop as **Julyan** in 2018, Julian started drifting through tons of different electronic genres under his _Lian Feldd_ alias, before eventually settling on DnB in the early 2020s. What started with bootlegs of _Sikdope_, _Julien Fade_ and the _Kahoot_ theme, eventually lead to him finding his footings on both legendary Dutch liquid forge _Fokuz_ and Nymfo's very own, still very fresh _Love For Low Frequencies_ imprint. Often in cahoots with fellow Dutchie talent _TER3NCE_, he slowly but surely built up an incredibly solid discography, with more bootlegs for _Belle Delphine_, _Taylor Swift_, and _C418_ sprinkled on top, and even started performing at big shows like _In:Fokuz_ and _Blackout_'s shows in Utrecht. Of course, his contribution to the EP, **Mana**, also pulls in influences from all sorts of different corners, taking us on a tranquil journey of the most suave sounding synths I've heard in a _while_, while also gently navigating through a whole plethora of different drums. So, so good.

**2.5. Conclusion**  

Vibes upon vibes, each darker and more mysterious than the last, from some of The Netherlands' most exciting new talents!

The eternal showdown of 8GB vs. 16GB RAM is the heavyweight champ of questions I‚Äôve seen floating around‚Äîseriously, it‚Äôs asked more often than ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs the coffee?‚Äù in a Monday morning meeting.

What follows is my personal blend of opinion, nerdy research, and hands-on experience‚Äîthink of it as a tech testimonial from yours truly. I‚Äôve tangoed with an M1 8/256GB, twirled with an M2 16/256GB, and waltzed with an M3 24/512GB. I‚Äôm not here to throw shade or catch flak; I‚Äôm just your friendly neighborhood geek trying to steer you toward the perfect MacBook match.

Not everyone‚Äôs an amateur tech wizard like me‚ÄîI mean, I build Windows gaming PCs in my spare time for kicks and giggles while keeping my finger on the pulse of the latest tech buzz. So, let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre not ready to drop $800+ on a shiny new MacBook, and after some savvy sleuthing, you spot a sweet deal on an M1 or M2 with 8/512GB. Tempting, right?

First, let‚Äôs demystify this ‚Äúswap‚Äù business‚Äîfancy term, simple concept. It‚Äôs like a backstage pass for your operating system: when your RAM‚Äôs tapped out, swap lets macOS borrow some SSD space to keep the show running smoothly‚Äîno crashes, no meltdowns. Think of it as your Mac‚Äôs secret superpower.

Now, let‚Äôs compare apples to‚Ä¶ well, SSDs. Take a budget-friendly Crucial P3 Plus (500GB)‚Äîit‚Äôs the closest cousin to a Mac‚Äôs internal SSD I could find. Crucial slaps a 150 TBW rating on it. TBW? That‚Äôs ‚ÄúTerabytes Written,‚Äù or how much data the SSD can handle before it waves the white flag. Time for some napkin math!

150TB = 150,000GB. Say you‚Äôre the average Mac user, upgrading every 5 years (that‚Äôs roughly 1,800 days). Divide 150,000GB by 1,800, and you‚Äôre writing 83GB *daily* to wear that SSD out. For an 8/256GB model, it‚Äôs more like 42GB a day. Are you, the average Joe or Jane, hammering your swap with 83GB every single day? Psh, not unless you‚Äôre secretly rendering Pixar movies on the sly!

Picture this: You‚Äôre a photography student with a passion for video editing and Photoshop, but your wallet‚Äôs on a diet. The MacBook Air M1, M2, or M3? Not the problem‚Äîheck, even the M1‚Äôs got enough muscle to flex through those tasks like a champ. The real question is resolution. Tight budget? An 8/512GB MacBook Air will breeze through 1080p video like it‚Äôs Sunday brunch. But if you‚Äôre diving into 4K territory, you‚Äôll want at least 16GB of RAM to keep things silky smooth. Storage woes? The 256GB models are the bargain bin darlings, and a speedy 1TB external SSD is yours for just $70-90. Boom, problem solved!

Hope I‚Äôve cleared the RAM fog for you! Got more questions? Hit me up‚ÄîI‚Äôm Fabio, your tech-talkin‚Äô pal, ready to assist.

1j2h1sx,https://www.reddit.com/r/Kafka/comments/1j2h1sx/joe_k_part_14/,Joe K - Part 14,"As if the zephyrs, the CCTV cameras and the black helicopters weren't enough to worry about, K now had to contend with a powerful organisation secretly controlling Britannia through an intricate network of leveraged influence. Could this have been the invisible hand behind his arrest? He knew that was a question he would never find the answer to, but there was another question that he had to find an answer to - what the hell was he going to say to Womble? When he let himself into North Block, he saw Katie and Robbie disappearing around the first bend on the stairwell. They must have gone somewhere on the way home from school because Robbie was trailing behind with his Scooby Doo bag over his shoulder when he waved at K, who smiled back with an uncharacteristic lack of enthusiasm. It was possible that Katie hadn't seen him at all, but it was probable that she was only pretending not to have. He slowly walked up the stairs, waiting for the sound of their front door shutting behind them.

Inside his flat, he took a couple of leaping pills and lay down on the couch. Why did he have to go and take that story to Broker? Why did he have to go and meet Womble in the first place? It seemed that every step he'd taken since his arrest had brought him deeper into a world of shit magnitudes beyond the one he'd spent his entire life avoiding. There was no chance of persuading Womble of the veracity of Broker's claims and there was no chance of getting him to drop the whole vigilante vengeance thing, with or without K's help, unless he could be. So, what the hell was he going to say to Womble? Regretting that he hadn't asked Broker's advice at the time, he remembered that the journalist *had* given him some and, although not directly relevant, it might unburden his load enough to give him the capacity to deal with the Womble question. It took him a while to find the phone number he'd written down after his mother's funeral among all the other pieces of paper discarded in the bottom drawer in the kitchen, and even longer to work up the courage to phone his brother, but at least it was long enough for him to decide which part of his story sounded the least crazy - it was the part where he thought he was going crazy. ""Ben?... It's Joe... your brother... is it a bad time?""

""No, I'm a little surprised but I'm glad you phoned. I think I'm going crazy.""

""*You're*...?""

""I think I'm being followed.""

""*You're*...? ... Ben?... Ben!""

""Sorry, I thought I heard a noise.""

""Why would anyone be following you?""

""Because they think I'm a traitor.""

""Traitor? To who?""

""To 'our people', Joey. I went on an anti-apartheid protest in New York a few weeks back and since then...""

""Wait, anti-apartheid?""

""What would you call it?""

""That's not what I meant. It's just, you know... dad.""

""What about dad?""

""Well, maybe you're paranoid because of what happened to dad.""

""Oh my god, you still believe that story? Dad wasn't killed by fascists on an anti-apartheid protest - he never went on the protest. He went to London to fuck some woman and was murdered by her jealous husband.""

""Dad?""

""Yes, dad, he was at it all the time on his window cleaning rounds. Mum was getting ready to file for divorce when it happened.""

""But... she never said anything.""

""That's because the socialists thought he was a fucking hero and it suited us to let them think that. Mum was getting handouts off the idiots for years - how do you think I could afford to emigrate? We never told you at the time because you worshipped the old man and she didn't want to break your heart.""

""I didn't worship him, he was never there... and now I know why."" It was his mother that K had worshipped. Growing up in a place where nobody read books for pleasure, she had always assumed that his solitary habits would lead somewhere, and for her sake he'd wished they had, if only to give her some comfort at the end of her life. The thought that she might have felt so guilty for lying about his dad that she took it all the way to her deathbed with her was what really broke his heart.

""So what do you think?"" said Ben.

""I think you should have told me.""

""Not that, who cares about that, it was years ago, what about now? I don't know if I'm being followed or I'm losing my mind - you have no idea what that's like, Joey. So, what did you phone me about?""

""Just... to see how you are.""

""Well, now you know. I gotta go, I need to take this call.""

""Alright, you take of yourself, Ben."" The line went dead half way through and K put the phone down. ""Well, that helped.""

Back to his own problem, K decided, not for the first time in his life, that the best thing to do, coincidently, was the least stressful to himself - nothing. He'd let Womble assume that plan B was going ahead in the hope that he would realise the danger of plan A before he discovered otherwise. He had no real proof that the Titorelli Close story was true, anyway. The doubts raised by Broker in the Culo Nero may have been buried by his subsequent revelation, but that didn't make their reasoning any less valid - it *could* all be some elaborate setup by a crazy cop bent on revenge against the man who'd ruined his life. But K's instincts were telling him otherwise. Instincts? Since when did he have instincts?

At least for as long as it took that special K edition of *The Afterglow* to come and go, he decided to stay in his flat and screen his calls. With a pencil and pad, he took a quick inventory of the fridge and food cupboards, working out how long he could survive. Just five or six days, unless he started over-indulging takeaways and his latest bank statement suggested that wasn't a good idea without going back to work, which would defeat the whole point of the exercise. He settled on five days without any human contact, including delivery drivers. He lasted less than ten minutes. If the knock on his door hadn't been as faint as it was persistent he might have ignored it.

""Hi Robbie, what is it?""

""Please, can you come and see mum?"" he said. He took K's hand, lead him to the open door of his flat and pointed inside.

""Katie?"" said K, tentatively entering and hearing Robbie shutting the door behind them.

""Joe?"" said Katie from the kitchen, drawing him in. She was chopping up vegetables in a Radiohead t-shirt. ""I didn't hear the door.""

""Robbie came to fetch me, is everything alright?""

""I'm fine... Robbie?""

""You need to say sorry to Joe and he needs to forgive you,"" he said, drawing long questioning eyes from both, more to avoid the embarrassment of meeting each others, than a genuine request for elaboration, but Robbie took it at face value. ""Today in school we learnt about apple-juicing and forgiving and..."" The tension created by the adults had drained his confidence.

""Have you learnt about interfering in other people's business, yet? or is that next week's lesson?"" gently reprimanded Katie, but when her son lowered his eyes like he'd done something wrong, she realised the mistake of unloading her own uneasiness onto him and quickly decided to clear the air. ""I'm sorry, honey,"" she said, slightly confusing things for Robbie by 'apple-juicing' to him instead of to K. ""Maybe Joe's still not ready to forgive me yet. Sometimes, these things take time."" Maybe Joe doesn't know what you're talking about, thought K. Maybe Joe thought it was him who owed you an apology.

""Mr Rose said you should always listen, and if you're not ready to forgive, you should explain why, but Joe didn't listen.""

""I'm sorry about this,"" said Katie, confusing things even more for Robbie by 'apple-juicing' for him instead of for herself, and causing him to shy away from K. ""It was when we passed on the stairs and you... still seemed angry at me.""

""I'm not angry at you,"" said K, thinking it was about time he took control of this obvious misunderstanding and found out the cause of it. He turned to Robbie. ""I'm not angry at your mum, and I'm *definitely* not angry at you - you're absolutely right and I promise to listen to your mum's apology and either forgive her or explain why I can't. Mr Rose sounds like a good teacher.""

""He's great,"" said Robbie, happy to see that his bold move appeared to be paying off at last. ""At the end of the lesson, all the white boys said sorry to everyone else for being white boys.""

""Really?"" said Katie. ""How do feel about that, honey?""

""It was fun, they all forgave us and the whole gang cheered apart from Harry, who doesn't like saying 'sorry'. He told me after that he's going to ask his mum and dad if he can be a girl so he doesn't have to.""

""Hmm... Say, why don't you go and play for a bit, give me and Joe some privacy? there's something I need to say to him."" She winked and he skipped off to his room and closed the door, clearly pleased with himself for getting the two of them together. ""Bloody hell! He thinks he's in gang of white boys - looks like I'm gonna have to have a word with Mr Rose. Anyway, I guess I owe you an apology, don't I?""

""I don't know, I've got no idea what you two have been talking about since I got here.""

""Then why have you been ignoring me?""

""I haven't, I thought you were ignoring me?""

""Why would I be ignoring you?""

""I... thought I might have said something to upset you.""

""Whatever it was, I'm sure it wasn't that bad - I would have told you otherwise, you know me... Maybe you ought to sit down.""

""Maybe I don't want to hear this.""

""Maybe I ought to get Robbie back in here to remind you about 'apple-juicing'... Just hear me out, that's all I ask."" He gave her what he hoped was a reassuring, encouraging smile. ""Let me just finish cutting up this veg and put some pasta on."" She offered him a seat on the couch, next to a volume of her Kurt Vonnegut anthology.

K was staring, longingly, at a drawing of a gravestone with the epitaph - *Everything Was Beautiful, and Nothing Hurt*, when she joined him on the couch. ""I'm reading *God Bless You, Mr Rosewater* to Robbie - he likes it.""

""That doesn't surprise me, he's a smart kid. What do they say? - 'the apple-juice never falls far from the squeeze', is that it?...""

""Ha, it's all my dad's influence really. Now, he *is* a great teacher. He says - 'always answer a question with a question', and - 'show, don't tell' and - 'don't tell them *what* to think, teach them *how* to think'. He was reading Vonnegut to me when I was Robbie's age and, when my mum died years later, *Slaughterhouse Five* really helped me to process it."" The conversation had taken an unexpected turn and K felt the need to back away.

""Is Rosewater the one whose wife's leaving him and he tells her he loves her and she says, 'You love everyone, what makes me so special?'?""

""Yeah... Maybe that's why Jesus never got married... Why did you never get married?""

""Well, it's not because I love everyone, I assure you. You know, you're the third person to ask me that question, lately - after a policeman and a doctor - and I'm beginning to think it's a pointless question to ask.""

""So I'm unoriginal *and* pointless?""

""That's not what I meant. Have you ever heard of the anthropic cosmological principle?""

""Did they play the jazz stage at Glastonbury this year?""

""It's a fancy name for a simple idea, a Vonnegutesque response to the question - why are we here? It says that it's pointless to ask why the conditions for intelligent life exist in the universe, because if they didn't, we wouldn't be here to ask.""

""So, what your saying is... it's pointless to ask why you've never got married, because if you had, you would be? See, the problem with that is the *why* \- she's not the same *why* as your cosmic anthropological *why*. You gotta be careful what you do with a *why* 'cause she's always putting on airs. She's a stuck up little bitch, but really she's just a *how come* in a designer dress. That means you never know what you're getting with a w*hy* \- she can carry too much baggage or not enough, she can be cosmological or completely illogical.""

""I think I'm becoming completely illogical. It must be the leaping pills the doctor gave me.""

""*Leaping* pills? What do they do?""

""Help me... leap.""

""Can I have one? I seem to be having a bit of trouble leaping into this confession.""

""I'm having a bit of trouble letting you... go on.""

""OK, but you've got to understand that I *am* very sorry, and I feel really bad about this, but I didn't do it on purpose and, I promise, I didn't know what he was gonna do. I didn't even tell him your name, I don't know how he found out...""

""Wait, who?""

""Abe.""

""Abe?""

""Abel Broker.""

""Broker? - how do you know Broker?""

""From the club, he brings in cash machines and pays the girls for information about them.""

""Cash machines?""

""Rich guys with lots of money to spend, often thousands of pounds.""

""For *information*?"" said K, struggling to get a grip on all *this* information.

""No, *Abe*... *Broker* pays us for information... about the cash machines. What they did and said in their private dances, any propositions they made, any unusual requests, what their kinks and dirty little secrets are - anything he can embellish to get a story out of, basically. You'd be surprised what guys say when their guards are down, and it's not all sexual. I had a professor of economics bragging about a tax avoidance scheme he promised to get me into if I...""

""Wait, are you saying he paid you for information about me?""

""No! It was just idle chit chat while we were hanging out at the bar. It was quiet night.""

""When was this?""

""The night you and me last spoke.""

""The night you came to see me after you saw me getting arrested?""

""It wasn't like that, Joe, I promise. How was I to know he'd be interested in you, you're hardly a cash machine. It was a normal conversation over a drink, about all sorts of stuff, and I just happened to mention my neighbour who'd been arrested that morning. He must have found out your name from someone at the housing office, or the police, or I guess he could've just asked someone at the block - that bloody German woman's always gossiping...""

""Wait, this was before I'd met him,"" said K, finally starting to realise what Katie was trying to tell him, so fixated had he been on her role in all this. ""Two nights before he'd offered to help me with my case when I turned up to clean his house. He must have phoned up Clean Knows and specifically requested me. That's insane, why would he do that?""

""There must be something in it for him, there always is. What's he been doing?""

""Introducing me to some people that might help my case."" K didn't feel like being more specific, even the thought of Stone made his stomach turn, and as for mentioning all that stuff in the park, where do you start? Besides, he was really starting to bond with Broker and, in spite of Katie's strange revelation, his mind was determined to find some way to cut him some slack. ""He must have wanted to surprise you by doing a favour for your friend, and, when he found all that stuff about me on the internet, figured there might be a little story in it, too."" It was an interpretation that K thought explained all the facts and didn't leave him feeling too uncomfortable, but Katie wasn't going to let him get away with it.

""There *was* no stuff about you on the internet, babes, it was all fake. He used an app on his phone to create it with AI-generated *users* posting fake messages based on the typical shit you see in real online forums. He only did it to get you trust him, it's what he does. He becomes whoever people want him to be, even changing the artwork in his house, just to get what he wants out of them. You remember his drug addict butty from university? He's told that story hundreds of times and the only detail that ever changes is the sister's tattoo.""

""His name wasn't Joe?""

""His name wasn't anything, Broker created him out of thin air, it's all bullshit.""

""And the whistleblower?""

""What whistleblower? He never told me that one.""

""Quincy Duarte.""

""Bloody hell, that's obviously a fake name. He must be getting to the point where he wants to get caught. That's what happens with these bloody sociopaths after they lose all sense of their own identity in an increasingly convoluted web of lies. That's probably why he started opening up to me - some desperate cry for help.""

""Why you?""

""...Alright, I admit it, we were lovers. But I dumped him when I found out what he'd done to you... well, that was most it anyway. The final straw came the following weekend when he brought this little wannabe gangster creep to the club. It was comical at first, watching him posing and manspreading and trying to look cool drinking a vodka and tonic through a straw. We were pissing ourselves laughing - only behind his back, of course. To his face, professional standards were maintained, even with him acting like he was in a rap video, throwing fivers around like they were hundred dollar bills, and not spending any real money, mind you, not one private dance. Then, after two hours of this shit, I had the misfortune to walk past him on my way for a cigarette and the fucker trumps me.""

""Trumps you?""

""Grabs me by the pussy.""

""Shit... Well, I know a good lawyer if you need one - well a lawyer, anyway.""

""Now, what have I told you about knights in shining armour? Sword or briefcase, they can all do one, I'll fight my own battles.""

""So what did you do?""

""Punched the perv in the bollocks, of course. And what does Broker do? starts apologising to the little creep for *my* behaviour. So I dumped him there and then and I haven't seen him since. My shifts have been cancelled and I suspect he's behind that. Unfortunately for me, he brings a lot of money to the club. You couldn't get me job with Clean Knows could you?""

""I didn't think you liked cleaning.""

""I don't, but I'm gonna need a job soon and about the only thing I can do, apart from shaking my arse, is cleaning and cooking - shit, the pasta.""

The food unspoiled and on schedule, Katie knocked on Robbie's door, poked her head in and asked him if they could have a guest for dinner. ""I'd better check,"" she said to her son, then walked back over to K. ""He said it's alright as long as you've forgiven me."" For the first time since they'd known each other, it was K who initiated the hug. The couch was moved and they sat cross-legged on the floor, eating bowls of vegetable pasta. There was plenty to go around, if only because Katie's claims to be able to clean *and* cook were a bit of an exaggeration. She had baked some very nice Welsh cakes, though, and K had two with his coffee.

After dinner, Robbie washed the dishes and K wiped - with quality control instructions that proved unnecessary - while the boy taught him the etymologies of the different pasta shapes. Then he asked K why everyone likes his mum calling them ""babes"", but when he said it to a girl in the lunch queue she got really upset and called him ""Miss Organist."" Handing the salt cellar to K, so he could put it in the overhead cupboard, Robbie was minded to tell him about Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian independence movement. When the kitchen was clean, they all played at being robots, mother and son in their home-made costumes and K improvising with a metal colander, cheese grater and kitchen tongs. When Robbie's batteries ran out, Katie put him to bed and they put the couch back. ""Are we alright then, babes?"" she said.

""We're more than alright,"" he said, with the exhausted joy written on his red face. ""At least I am. It's been a long time since I've done anything..."" It was so long, he couldn't remember the word for it.

""Silly?""

""Yeah...silly.""

""Ludwig Wittgenstein said, 'If people didn't sometimes do silly things, nothing intelligent would ever get done.""

""Wittgenstein was a beery swine.""

""He knew what he was talking about then.""

""*He* might have, but I tried one of his books once and I didn't have clue what he was talking about... I suppose I'd better go...""

""Yeah, you'd better go... grab us a couple of Wittgenstein's, and I'll make us a spliff - it's your turn to pick the film."" He chose *True Romance*. Of course he did.",1,1741003080.0,Kafka,0,1.0,False

My dad‚Äîstubborn, independent, and convinced he didn‚Äôt need ‚Äúone of those alert things‚Äù‚Äîhad collapsed in his kitchen. Alone.

The scariest part? If he hadn‚Äôt finally given in and started using a medical alert system, I don‚Äôt know if he‚Äôd still be here.

# The Day Everything Changed

He had been against the idea for years. ""I'm fine,"" he‚Äôd always say. ""I don't need a babysitter."" But after his doctor warned him about his rising blood pressure and the risk of sudden falls, I convinced him to try one ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù

That ‚Äújust in case‚Äù moment came faster than we expected.

That morning, he was making coffee when dizziness hit him like a wave. Before he knew it, he was on the floor, unable to move. His phone was on the counter‚Äîcompletely out of reach. But he pressed the emergency button on his alert device.

Within seconds, an operator responded. They stayed on the line with him, assessed the situation, and dispatched an ambulance. By the time the paramedics arrived, he was barely conscious.

# Why This Matters

It turned out he had suffered a transient ischemic attack (a mini-stroke). Doctors said that getting help quickly made all the difference. If he had been alone for even an hour, the outcome could have been devastating.

I used to think these devices were just another unnecessary gadget. Now, I see them for what they really are‚Äîlifelines. If you have aging parents, please don‚Äôt wait for a wake-up call like I did.

1j2gwog,https://v.redd.it/64otbs2cqgme1,"Experimenting with different baskets. Recommendations, suggestions welcomed","Hi everyone. I bought a used flair 58 2023 edition 3 months ago, it included both low flow and high flow baskets, and a couple extras like a normcore puck screen, 3 part blind shaker (which I rarely use, I only do WDT and use the dosing ring for the basket), and the basket in the video, which is for 20g.

I haven't had any issues with the stock baskets, I started with the Low Flow for some more developed roasts, but now I'm primarily using the High Flow as I tend to get more medium/medium-light roasts. For the first time in my espresso journey I could perceive more flavors other than just ""espresso"". However I'm still experimenting and I'm not hitting the most consistent shots. Sometimes I get varying ammounts of time duration for the same settings, sometimes my shots are a bit bitter with shorter pulls, sometimes my shots are a bit sour at longer pulls, etc.
I'm not really fussing about it too much because I still enjoy it and experimenting is part of the fun of it. However I still think I need a bit of guidance, especially as I tend to want more extraction and such. 

This shot in particular was ok, nothing really new or mindblowing with the different basket, but then again it was my last 20g from a month old bag of beans I bought from a trip to Brasil.

Some people tend to argue grinding coarser for a better extraction with a longer ratio, but most High Extraction basket discussion tends to aim for a finer grind. I know the first step in brewing good coffee is to first get good beans, still I get puzzled sometimes with the ammount of information and how it varies from recipe and espresso style (i.e turbo shots).

This is the reply by Araku Coffee India:

Thank you for the comprehensive review. We appreciate the time and detail you‚Äôve put into it. We always enjoy interacting with people who take their coffee very seriously. At ARAKU, we focus on bringing out the natural character of our beans, which means you might notice variations in color‚Äîthis isn‚Äôt inconsistency, but a reflection of our organic, single-origin approach. Since we pre-blend before roasting, every batch is crafted to highlight the unique flavors of our terroir without masking them. And this is how the individual processes convert into the final cup. On packaging, we hear you! While our current design prioritizes freshness, we‚Äôre working on a more sustainable solution for refills. In the meantime, our reusable tins make great storage and can be upcycled in many ways. ARAKU is built on more than just certifications‚Äîit‚Äôs a farmer-led movement that‚Äôs globally recognised for fair trade and regenerative farming. Having said that, certifications help us bridge the gap between smallholder farmers and international markets, thus ensuring sustainable profits for our farmer families. We know there‚Äôs always room to improve, and fresh perspectives help us introspect and stay on track. Thanks for sharing your thoughts, and we hope you keep exploring our coffees!

Not shy but Reserved. Will rarely talk to others on his own. He is nice and gemuine but not used to sharing things about himself. Often prefers to be by himself rather than with others. But who knows? Maybe someone at CBH will be able to break through his shell.


***

#Trivia

* His father forced him to go to Camp Half Blood at 17 after meeting a new girlfriend and wanting to start a new life without his 'unusal distractions'. 

* Loves animals a lot but they never seem to like him much, except for the cat at one of the libraries in his city. Finley often finds himself missing that cat.

* His favourite music artist is Hozier.

* His best friend and only friend is Sunny, a guy he met ing primary school. Sunny felt hurt because Finley left for camp so suddenly without saying anything before. 


***

#History: 

Finley was used to being alone. His father was barely home as his lawfirm kept him busy. The nannies his father hired to watch him barely provided any emotional support for him, as most of them didn't stay with the family long. So Finley learnt to be fine by himself. In school, he preferred to be by himself and lose himself in his daydreams rather than making friends. A boy in his class named Sunny kept persisting on getting to know him. He got hurt pretty severely in a monster attack once, which made Finley even more hesitant towards letting others close. He pretty much only ever had his little sister and Sunny.

He found out about camp half blood at 17 when his father found a new girlfriend and decided Finley didn't fit into the family he was trying to start. Finley didn't want to leave but he didn't have any choice in the matter as his father forced him to.




#Present Day:

Finley thought being the son of literal tragedy fit his situation quite well. He usually liked flying. Buisness class wasn't so bad and something about being above the clouds provided a magical scope for the imagination. Now was different, though. Because the hurt on Sunny's face from yesterday wasn't just one of Finley's daydreams. And neither was the frustration in his best friend's voice or the fight they were in now. This certainly felt like tragedy. 

Finley couldn't wait to get out of his seat as soon as the plane landed. He rushed off the plane as if fresh air would be able to erase the memories of yesteday. It couldn't. At least the rest of the day would be able to distract him.

The driver had eyes everywhere. It was slightly unnerving to sit in the backseat of a car when you don't know if the driver could turn into some demigod-eating monster any second. Finley watched the landscape pass by as they drove to Camp Half Blood. It was just another place that would disappoint Finley, he was sure of that. Because besides Sunny and Anika, everything felt like a disappointment. Maybe that made this a little better because thag meant this camp wouldn't be any worse than anything else.

What Finley hadn't expected was seeing actual greek warriors fighting and riding on pegasai and satyrs working in strawberry fields. He didn't know what he expected but certainly not this. The driver showed him to a cabin and where his bunk was and then left him to his own devices after assuring him someone would come to show him around soon.  Finley decided he may aswell wait outside the stuffy cabin and sat on its frontsteps, looking lost, instead.

If you love stylish yet pragmatic furniture, here‚Äôs a trend you will definitely want to keep an eye on: we are talking about multi-functional side tables. These aren‚Äôt just your average, static pieces for [placing coffee cups](https://f31.sg/product-category/living-room/living-room-1/coffee-table-singapore/) or books, but they are modern additions that can transform spaces with their versatility, storage solutions, and creative designs.

¬†

Whether you live in a spacious home or a compact city apartment, a multi-functional **side table in Singapore** can be a true game-changer. Wondering why these small but mighty tables are rising in popularity and why you should consider adding one (or two) to your space? Here you go!

¬†

# #1 Space-Saving Magic for Modern Homes

With more and more people moving towards minimalist and functional designs, furniture that serves multiple purposes is in high demand. Multi-functional side tables offer storage and mobility, which makes them ideal for compact living spaces, especially in cities like Singapore, where every square foot counts.

¬†

Your sleek side table can double as a bookshelf and nightstand all in one. Now, isn‚Äôt that smart furniture at its finest? However, if you are short on space, look for nesting or stackable side tables that can be expanded when needed and tucked away when not in use.

¬†

# #2 More than Just a Table- A Statement Piece

Gone are the days when side tables were purely functional. Today‚Äôs designs make them quite aesthetically pleasing focal points in any room. From sculptural metal bases to wood-and-marble combos, multi-functional side tables can bring character and personality to your space.

¬†

For instance, if you are looking for a chic, modern touch, try a marble-topped side table with built-in storage compartments. Or if you prefer a cosy, Scandinavian vibe, you can opt for a wooden side table with hidden drawers to keep clutter out of sight.

¬†

You can also pair your side table with a statement lamp, a small indoor plant, or a stack of books, and you can get an effortlessly stylish look.

¬†

# #3 Versatility: From Living Room to Bedroom and Beyond

One of the biggest perks of multi-functional side tables is how easily they adapt to different spaces. You can use them in the living room as a snack tray, remote holder, or even a laptop stand when working from home. In the bedroom, you can use it as a [stylish nightstand with drawers](https://f31.sg/the-undeniable-advantages-of-having-a-bedside-table-in-your-bedroom/), and there you can keep the essentials within reach. On the other hand, a foldable side table can serve as an extra surface when needed and disappear when you aren‚Äôt using it.

¬†

# #4 Budget-Friendly and Long-Lasting

Unlike bulky furniture, side tables are an affordable way to refresh your space without breaking the bank. Plus, since they are multi-functional, you get more value for your money. Many high-quality side tables are made from durable materials like solid wood, metal, and tempered glass, ensuring they last for years. So, whether you are investing in a sleek, high-end design or a budget-friendly piece, you‚Äôre making a smart, long-term purchase.

This surge in adoption marks a surprising step towards mainstream acceptance, even amidst some pretty murky regulatory waters. Talk about resilience! üåè‚ú®

From China to Vietnam, South Korea, Thailand, and India, merchants are stepping up to accept Pi Coin. Can you imagine paying for your morning coffee or even a shiny new car with a crypto token? Yes, please! In China, BYD Auto Service Co. is making headlines by allowing full payments in Pi. It's an incredible breakthrough, with pioneers snapping up cars at a fixed Global Consensus Value. Who knew Pi could drive such excitement!

Meanwhile, cozy cafes in Vietnam are letting you pay for your breakfast sets with Pi, proving that this token is not just for the heavy hitters. And over in South Korea, some clinics are now letting patients use Pi for up to 50% of their payments. Talk about making beauty accessible! üíÑüíï

However, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. China and Vietnam have issued warnings about Pi, raising questions about its legitimacy. Risks could be involved, and who wants to gamble with hard-earned cash, right? Keep your eyes peeled, beautiful people!

Amid these challenges, the community's push for Pi is irresistible and seems to be gaining momentum. As the alternative peer-to-peer payment method grows globally, it might just shake things up in the crypto universe. üí∏üî•

Keep your eyes on those charts as Pi's price dances up and down, currently trading at $1.6525. Let's see whether it can get its groove back.

I‚Äôm a store manager at a big coffee company, 22 weeks pregnant, been back for 5 months but worked here before for over 2 years. Since announcing my pregnancy, I‚Äôve had zero support from senior management.

Biggest issue has been a supervisor with a history of being difficult. Last week they stormed off shift, shouted and swore at my assistant manager (ASM), caused a scene in front of customers. My regional manager (RM) saw it, rolled their eyes, and walked away. Later, they listed every staff member and said ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre not the issue‚Äù ‚Äî basically implying I am.

RM also ran after the supervisor to check on them, but didn‚Äôt check on my ASM who was verbally abused and body-shamed. When they finally spoke to them, just said ‚ÄúWhat the fuck happened there?‚Äù no concern for their wellbeing.

My area manager (AM) told me to document everything and email them + RM. I did, detailed dates, times, what happened. Got no reply. When ASM asked RM about it, they said they only read the first line and dismissed it as ‚Äúbullshit.‚Äù

Now I‚Äôm working 6 days a week, going over my 44-hour contract, while other pregnant employees have been given reduced hours or accommodations. I‚Äôve raised concerns, been ignored.

HR told my ASM ‚Äúeverything has been handled correctly‚Äù even though I have emails, call logs, and messages proving I‚Äôve asked for help and been brushed off.

Also, salary review came back with no increase even though my temp maternity cover (a trainee ASM with no experience) is getting the same ¬£31k salary as me, and will get an increase. Company made record profits but they blamed ‚Äúeconomic climate.‚Äù

Feels like my RM/AM are trying to push me out. I‚Äôm still on probation and worried they‚Äôll fail me to cover their own backs since they‚Äôre both also on probation. Haven‚Äôt raised a grievance yet because I don‚Äôt want to make things worse but feel stuck.

Can they actually fail my probation when I have so much evidence I‚Äôm being treated unfairly? Would HR even help or just put a target on my back? Also if I ask my midwife to reduce my hours, how does that work?",0,1740999906.0,LegalAdviceUK,6,0.5,False

She blocked him, but he made a new account and she added him back. As time went on, she would tell me ‚Äúhey, he texted me‚Äù. In response, I let it slide because I trust her. We were in a good spot in the relationship and I respected her. It wasn‚Äôt my favorite thing, but I have to pick my battles. She only brought this up twice until a couple days ago. She called me and asked ‚Äúwould you care if him and I hung out?

When I did text her, she purposely ignored me. I later found out that she texted him ‚Äúwyddd?‚Äù And called while I was studying and while he was in town. It really hurt, and she says they never hung out, which I believe, but my trust is almost gone. It felt like she asked to cheat on me in some way which was so odd.

https://preview.redd.it/7ejtqwythgme1.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb5d59ef30466d182a0976ccdad1a5747f5b61f

Hyderabad, with its dynamic mix of history, culture, and modernity, is an ideal city to explore on two wheels. Renting a bike gives you the freedom to navigate through the bustling city streets, discover hidden gems, and enjoy the open road without the constraints of a car or public transport. Whether you‚Äôre a local or a tourist, renting a bike in Hyderabad can make your travel experience far more enjoyable. But to truly make the most of your ride, it‚Äôs important to know the best times of year to rent a bike in Hyderabad.

In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through the ideal times to rent a bike in Hyderabad, considering factors like weather, local festivals, and peak tourism seasons. By understanding the best times to rent, you can plan your bike adventures for a smooth and enjoyable experience.

**1. Winter (November to February)**

**Why Winter is the Best Time to Rent a Bike in Hyderabad?**

Hyderabad experiences a relatively mild and pleasant winter season, making it one of the best times of the year to rent a bike and explore the city. The temperature during this time ranges from 15¬∞C to 30¬∞C (59¬∞F to 86¬∞F), offering comfortable conditions for both short rides and long road trips. The cool breeze and clear skies make winter perfect for sightseeing, whether you‚Äôre visiting the historic Charminar or taking a leisurely ride around Hussain Sagar Lake.

**Benefits of Renting a Bike in Winter:**

* **Pleasant Weather:** The weather is neither too hot nor too cold, making it ideal for outdoor activities like biking.
* **Clear Skies:** Winter months generally have clear skies and less humidity, making it easier to plan outdoor adventures.
* **Perfect for Weekend Getaways:** The cooler weather makes it perfect for bike trips to nearby destinations like Ananthagiri Hills or Nagarjuna Sagar.

**What to Do During Winter:**

* **Visit the Historical Monuments:** Take a bike ride to explore famous landmarks such as Golconda Fort, Qutb Shahi Tombs, and Chowmohalla Palace.
* **Take a Ride Around Necklace Road:** Enjoy the fresh air as you ride along Necklace Road, a popular spot for biking and enjoying the sunset.
* **Weekend Trips:** With the cool weather, this is also the best time for weekend getaways to nearby attractions like Pochampally Village or Nandi Hills.

**2. Monsoon (June to September)**

**Is it a Good Idea to Rent a Bike During Monsoon?**

While the monsoon season brings heavy rainfall to Hyderabad, it‚Äôs not the most ideal time to rent a bike if you‚Äôre looking for comfort and convenience. However, for those who enjoy the refreshing rain and the cool atmosphere, monsoon can offer a unique biking experience. The city‚Äôs landscape becomes lush and green during the monsoon, and some people enjoy riding through the rain as part of the adventure.

**Considerations for Renting a Bike in Monsoon:**

* **Rain and Wet Conditions:** The frequent downpours can make roads slippery and challenging for biking. It‚Äôs essential to ensure that the bike you rent has good tires and functional brakes.
* **Flooded Roads:** Some roads and routes may be prone to flooding during heavy rainfall, so it‚Äôs important to check the weather and avoid areas that may not be safe to navigate on a bike.
* **Limited Visibility:** The rain can reduce visibility, so extra caution is needed when riding.

**What to Do During Monsoon:**

* **Ride Around Lush Greenery:** Hyderabad‚Äôs parks, lakes, and surrounding landscapes come alive during the monsoon. Ride through places like Durgam Cheruvu or KBR National Park, where the rain enhances the beauty of nature.
* **Explore the City‚Äôs Cafes:** A bike ride through the rain might lead you to cozy caf√©s and quiet spots, where you can enjoy a warm cup of tea or coffee while waiting for the rain to pass.

**3. Summer (March to May)**

**Summer in Hyderabad: A Challenging Time for Biking**

Hyderabad can get unbearably hot during the summer months, with temperatures often rising above 40¬∞C (104¬∞F). While summer is not the most comfortable time for bike rentals, it does offer the advantage of fewer tourists and less crowded tourist spots. For those who still wish to rent a bike in summer, early mornings and late evenings are the best times to avoid the scorching heat of the midday sun.

**Challenges of Renting a Bike in Summer:**

* **Intense Heat:** The sweltering heat can make long rides uncomfortable and tiring.
* **Sun Exposure:** Prolonged exposure to the sun can lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion, so it‚Äôs important to stay hydrated and protect yourself from the sun.
* **Limited Daylight Hours for Comfortable Rides:** During the peak afternoon heat, it‚Äôs best to avoid long trips or bike rides.

**What to Do During Summer:**

* **Morning or Evening Rides:** Start your bike ride early in the morning or late in the evening, when temperatures are more bearable.
* **Ride to Cooler Spots:** Explore places like Hussain Sagar Lake or the Shilparamam cultural village, where the surroundings are cooler.
* **Avoid Midday Rides:** Plan your trips around cooler times of the day to ensure your comfort and safety.

**4. Festivals and Special Events**

**Best Times to Rent a Bike During Festivals**

Hyderabad is a city of vibrant festivals, and these celebrations offer a great opportunity to rent a bike and explore the city in a unique way. The streets come alive with lights, decorations, and local culture, and biking around during this time can be an exciting experience. The major festivals include:

* **Bonalu (July-August):** A colorful festival celebrated at the Ujjaini Mahankali Temple, Bonalu involves processions, rituals, and music. Biking through the city during this time gives you the chance to witness the festival‚Äôs vibrant atmosphere.
* **Diwali (October-November):** Diwali is celebrated with grand lights, decorations, and festivities throughout the city. A bike ride through the city during Diwali can be magical, as you witness the streets lit up with beautiful lights and decorations.
* **Sankranti (January):** Sankranti is one of the most important festivals in Hyderabad, celebrated with kite flying, bonfires, and traditional celebrations. Renting a bike during this time allows you to participate in the cultural events and explore the lively streets.

**Benefits of Renting a Bike During Festivals:**

* **Witness the Festivities:** Festivals are a perfect time to rent a bike and ride around the city to experience Hyderabad‚Äôs cultural richness and celebrations.
* **Avoid Traffic and Parking Issues:** During festivals, finding a parking spot can be difficult. A bike gives you the flexibility to navigate through crowded areas and easily find parking.
* **Unique Festival Views:** Biking during festivals lets you explore the city in a way that cars and other transport options can‚Äôt offer. You can stop at key spots to capture the essence of the festivities.

**5. Off-Peak Seasons (October to March)**

**Why Off-Peak is Great for Renting a Bike**

The off-peak season, particularly between October and March, is one of the best times to rent a bike in Hyderabad. The weather is mild, and there are fewer tourists compared to the summer and monsoon months. The city is not overly crowded, and you can enjoy a relaxed ride through the city and its outskirts.

**Advantages of Renting a Bike in Off-Peak Season:**

* **Clear Weather:** With comfortable temperatures, it‚Äôs ideal for long rides without the worries of excessive heat or rain.
* **Less Crowded Tourist Spots:** You can visit popular tourist attractions without dealing with large crowds.
* **More Bike Availability:** With fewer tourists, you‚Äôll find that bike rentals are more readily available during this time.

**What to Do During the Off-Peak Season:**

* **Explore Lesser-Known Attractions:** Visit hidden gems like Pochampally Village, Keesaragutta, or Taramati Baradari without the crowds.
* **Enjoy Peaceful Rides:** The off-peak season offers quiet roads and less traffic, making it perfect for long, uninterrupted bike rides.

**Conclusion**

The best time to [rent a bike in Hyderabad](https://www.boongg.com/bike-rent-hyderabad/miyapur) depends on your preferences, comfort levels, and the type of experience you‚Äôre looking for. For most riders, winter (November to February) offers the most pleasant conditions, with cool weather and clear skies perfect for sightseeing.

We ended up talking‚Äîabout books, old songs, and how the city feels different when it rains. It was easy, effortless, like we had met before in another life.

# 1. How Coffee Affects the Brain

Coffee contains caffeine, a natural stimulant that affects the central nervous system. When consumed, caffeine blocks adenosine, a neurotransmitter responsible for making you feel tired. As a result, caffeine increases the levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, enhancing alertness, concentration, and overall brain function.

# 2. Boosts Memory and Learning Ability

Studies show that caffeine can improve both short-term and long-term memory. It enhances the brain‚Äôs ability to store and recall information, making it an excellent drink for students and professionals who need to retain information efficiently.

# 3. Enhances Focus and Concentration

One of the most remarkable benefits of coffee is its potential to protect the brain from age-related diseases such as:

* **Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease** ‚Äì Research suggests that regular coffee consumption may reduce the risk of Alzheimer‚Äôs by up to 65%.
* **Parkinson‚Äôs Disease** ‚Äì Studies indicate that caffeine helps lower the risk of Parkinson‚Äôs disease and may even slow its progression.

Coffee stimulates brain function, which can lead to enhanced creativity and better problem-solving skills. Many artists, writers, and innovators rely on coffee to spark new ideas and improve cognitive flexibility.

The thing had very strong taste, little texture but not excessively watery. They did not seem to be using unordinary porte-filters. Any clues ?

Since then wifi wouldn't stay connected but if I did a power cycle it would connect momentarily and upload my custom recipes fine. The Aiden is never connected when I pull up the app after the machine is left alone and it goes into sleep mode. I've tried setting it up on both 2.4ghz only (IoT) and 2.4ghz/5ghz networks, made no difference. 

Aside from that I've been very happy with the single brew performance using recipes I did manage to get on the brewer. 

Today the brewer began to exhibit odd behaviour. I tried cold brew and used the batch basket for the first time. Had 110g of coffee grounds in and had to setup a custom concentrate recipe on the brewer itself because it wouldn't load up the recipe from the app as it did before. It's the first time I observe the screen on the brewer blacking out for a few seconds when using the scroll wheel. It would reappear shortly but it almost seemed like it was thinking then ran out of memory. 

I didn't think much of it and went ahead with my 3 hour cold brew and shortly after the initial 60 sec bloom it just stopped and went back to the main menu. No error message, nothing. 110g of coffee wasted. I tried it again just to see if it was a once off glitch and it did the exact same thing again. 

Only thing I can think of is if the brew chamber got too full because I ground coarser, but I didn't get an error message which means I have no way of telling how to avoid it in the future.

I was initially super happy with how it tasted, having 1-2 sometimes even 3 cups of coffee per day. I used the original pods from Nespresso. Then suddenly at around December the coffee the machine was making started tasting foul. Like actually undrinkable (a chemical taste I don't know how else to describe it) - I would make coffee, have two sips and dump it in the sink. 

Here is everything I tried to fix it:

Tried other Nespresso original pods (thought I had a bad batch) - no luck

Descaled the machine with descaling solution - no luck

Cleaned the machine with a water cycle - no luck

Called Nespresso for troubleshooting. Was told that I was not using the correct cup size (espresso versus lungo) which was supposedly the reason for the bad taste. I tried the espresso on video call with the assistant- was totally fine (I was surprised). However, the next day I used the correct sizing and the coffee tasted awful again. 

Then I thought that the lungo compartment must be contaminated with something. So I tried only making espresso coffees - the awful taste was still there. 

The only option left is to try to Cafenu cleaning pods. But after so much trial and error. I don't even know if it's worth a shot. I am also upset about this because I bought my mom the exact same coffee machine for Christmas (before mine had awful taste) and I don't want the same thing to happen to hers. I know for a fact that there is something wrong with my machine because I can taste a considerable difference in the coffee her machine makes vs mine. 

  
Would appreciate any suggestions!

Longtime lurker in this sub, my fiance (30F) and I (28F) have been engaged since last May and we're in the depths of planning our May 2026 wedding. We've been loving the process, but there are some differing traditions/expectations as to what a wedding looks like and I would love to get some outside opinions, especially as our wedding is in the UK (Edinburgh).

1. Initially I thought 3pm was a good start time but my partner says that will seem really late in the day for a lot of British guests, we've settled on 2pm but this feels early to me! (schedule likely 2pm arrivals; 2:30 ceremony start; 3pm cocktail hour and canape reception (we go take photos); 4:30 call to the dining room; 5pm meal begins with speeches between courses (starter, main, cheese and port); 7pm back to the other space for coffee, tea, and cake while the dining room gets flipped for dancing; 7:45 first dance, father/daughter dance; 8pm party till midnight with a big snack and dessert table rolled out at 10pm)
2. My parents were appalled at the lack of open bar option, so have offered to put a card behind the bar. Its considered really rude and stingy to invite people to an event in Canada and not ""properly host them"" (ie. full meals, drinks, etc) so its standard back home, but will this be seen as extravagant or over the top here? Only one UK wedding we've been to had an open bar and it was a fancy London affair.
3. I've always imagined a father daughter dance, and have really looked forward to it the last few years living so far from my family, but I've never seen anyone do one here - will it be a strange thing to have?
4. Bands were always something seen as an expensive extra that I've only seen at the fanciest Canadian wedding, but almost every UK wedding we've been to has had a band! I was just planning on making some spotify playlists (ceremony, reception, dinner, dancing) and going from there but will people not enjoy themselves or think its weird?
5. Having our bridal parties stand either side of us during the ceremony? I always pictured having my brother and sister, as well as my three closest friends standing up there with me but I've noticed this never happens at UK weddings (or at least the ones I've been to!)
6. Not having any evening guests - again, I was always taught that excluding anyone from any part of the wedding created a ""second class"" guest tier and was incredibly rude. However, this has confused some members of my partners family because evening guests are so common here.
7. Then lots of details which I thought were standard but are reading ""formal"" or old fashioned amongst friends here: paper invitations, gift registry (mostly honeymoon cash fund, but some older relatives insisted on a list of physical gifts as well), organising discounts with hotels, a formal dress code, cake cutting, getting ready photos, having the invitations read ""together with their parents (our names) invite you to celebrate their wedding day"", things like that!

Really looking for any thoughts or things that raise a red flag for you! Mostly I just want everyone to have an amazing time and come celebrate with us, and I want them to feel taken care of and not have to worry about a thing.

(Just for context, I've lived here for 5 years and have been to both Canadian and British weddings, however my mom wrote and published wedding planning and budgeting books and I'm trying to shake the 80's/90's wedding decorum rules that were drilled into me from a young age haha)",1,1740998276.0,UKweddings,3,1.0,False

I‚Äôm not much of a coffee drinker, but I‚Äôd had to pee something fierce, and ducked in to find a line of three guys in front of the only restroom. ‚ÄúFuck,‚Äù I muttered, rocking on my heels. A curly haired girl in glasses watched me from behind her macbook. 

‚ÄúWow, looks like you need to go pretty bad, huh?‚Äù She closed her eyes and one by one, the line broke up as they left the shop, some walking, some running. 

‚ÄúWhat the?‚Äù One of the guys had even dropped his backpack. 

‚ÄúLucky you, I guess. You have to go, so go.‚Äù She returned to her laptop. 

‚ÄúOh thank Jesus,‚Äù After I went in and unleashed my torrent of piss, I went back out to find her. ‚ÄúWhat happened back there?‚Äù


‚ÄúPink polo heard his car alarm. Fauxhawk saw an old lady fall down. Blue backpack there saw a velociraptor.‚Äù She pointed at the two guys who‚Äôd come back looking all confused, and the guy‚Äôs backpack. 


‚ÄúA velociraptor?‚Äù 


‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the dinosaur from Jurassic-‚Äù

‚ÄúI know what a velociraptor is, why‚Äôd he see it?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause you looked way too cute to be that miserable, and because anything is infinitely more entertaining than memorizing the Krebs cycle.‚Äù She closed her macbook and looked at me. My neck got hot. 


‚ÄúWell shit, I don‚Äôt know how you did that, but can I get you a coffee or something? That was pretty cool.‚Äù 

That day, I learned that her name was Stella, what a macchiato was, that she could do weird shit, and she was cool as fuck. She‚Äôd close her eyes, think about something, and anyone she was near would see it. 

I offered her a ride to her dorm, which, in hindsight, sounded creepy, but she had superpowers, so I figured she could handle herself. On the way back, she made a slow driver think a cop was pulling them over, and we enjoyed the big ol open road ahead of us. I pulled over to the side of the hill by her dorm and we sat looking over the city. 

‚ÄúSo it‚Äôs almost midnight. Could you make the sun rise? I mean, make me think the sun‚Äôs rising?‚Äù I tore open a box of natty and handed her a can. 

‚ÄúEasily. And more. But I won‚Äôt.‚Äù She cracked the can, chugged it, and reached for another one. I just about fell in love with her right then and there. 

‚ÄúLook, your powers are yours. I‚Äôm not saying you hafta use them in a way. But I mean, you‚Äôre pretty awesome. And you‚Äôre hanging with me. So, not to toot my own horn, but my guess is you might like me. Why not show off a little? It‚Äôs not like they‚Äôre a secret.‚Äù We sat real quiet for a while, except for me slurping my beer. 

‚ÄúWhat, and you‚Äôd just sit here all mesmerized while I stare off into the darkness?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI dunno, beats us both sitting in the dark of my car drinking warm beer. Don‚Äôt you get tired of, like, everything?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not getting tired of you anytime soon.‚Äù She leaned over and we smooched. Okay it was more like a little peck. She kissed me. On the cheek. It was nice. I took her back. 

Anyway, that was the first day I met Stella, so you can see why I got her number after, and hung out loads, and asked her to be my girlfriend. And it was great, I‚Äôd pick her up in between shifts and take her downtown and she‚Äôd buy like ten frozen pizzas so she‚Äôd have something to eat between classes. I‚Äôd crash at her place and wash down one of the pizzas with a couple beers. She liked horror movies, and I got her a Ghostface mask for her birthday which tickled her pink. 

And then her mom answered one of those spam calls and emptied her bank account, and the money dried up for her to keep going to college, so she dropped out. And to add more shit onto the shit pile, she didn‚Äôt exactly approve of me, something about ‚Äúhaving no future‚Äù. I mean she was probably right, but it still hurt, and besides, we liked each other. So I didn‚Äôt see Stella for a few weeks, which sucked, until I got a text asking me to go to a hotel room. 

Shit, I never drove over so fast, I must‚Äôve broken like fifteen traffic laws. It was a fancy place in the middle of town, which was a little surprising, given her lack of money. They had a guy standing there in front of the front door, a guy standing there in front of the bathroom, a guy standing there in front of some random wooden box they just propped up in the hallway. Lots of guys standing around. Anyway, I got over to her room, which was a really nice one, and after an intense makeout session and some fun, it was time for the worst conversation of my life. 

‚ÄúSo you‚Äôre probably wondering.‚Äù Damn, she looked so pretty when she was hiding something. Or maybe I just hadn‚Äôt seen her in so long. 

‚ÄúThe fancy hotel? Your momma?‚Äù I reached over and touched her shoulder, but she shrank back.

‚ÄúYeah. She‚Äôs‚Ä¶ happy.‚Äù She looked a little worried. 

‚ÄúDid you?‚Äù 


‚ÄúShe thinks everything is going great, and she‚Äôs part of this big happy loving family. She thinks I went back to college, and that I‚Äôll graduate with honors in a few months.‚Äù She smiled while she said this but her voice shook like she was about to cry. 

‚ÄúAh. What happens then?‚Äù 


‚ÄúI‚Äôm still figuring that out.‚Äù 


‚ÄúHow long can your illusions even last, anyway?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI‚Äôm still figuring that out.‚Äù 


‚ÄúHow‚Äôd you get this hotel room?‚Äù 

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not mine. The guy who‚Äôs room this is was a real creep who thinks the FBI are after him.‚Äù She started picking at the skin on her fingernails. 

‚ÄúSo he ran?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶ in the closet.‚Äù My heart pounded in my chest. 

‚ÄúShit. So he was spying on us?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo, he thought his life was over, so he killed himself.‚Äù She squeezed me tight and cried into my shoulder. 

‚ÄúStella, what the fuck?‚Äù I pushed her away and headed for the closet. ‚ÄúYou killed someone? Did you kill your mom too?‚Äù 


She stopped crying. Now she sounded mad. ‚ÄúWhat? Everything I said to you has been the truth.‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt tell me you killed someone until I got here, until after we fucked. That doesn‚Äôt sound entirely truthful to me.‚Äù It was my turn to be mad. ‚ÄúStella, this is really bad.‚Äù 

She slid towards me. I slid back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to check the closet, maybe he just ate pills or something, maybe we can save him.‚Äù 

She grabbed my hand. ‚ÄúJacob, I was going to ask you to run away with me. I had it all planned out. But you- you just pushed me away, and now you‚Äôre arguing with me when I needed you the most!‚Äù 

I slid off the bed and swatted her hand away, making a beeline for the closet door. She shouted at my back. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to slip into a perfect paradise. You won‚Äôt want for anything anymore. You can leave your boring pizza delivery job behind. You can leave me behind. Go ahead, enjoy your fake world!‚Äù 

‚ÄúStella, we can fix this, just let me help!‚Äù I threw open the door. And the entire room melted into sand. I was alone, on a beach at sunrise by a resort, like you see in the movie posters. 

‚ÄúGoodbye, Jacob. I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù 

Long story short, the hotel was even nicer than the one in the real world. It had every food I could ever want, cooked perfectly. I‚Äôd spend my days walking down the beach, exploring this weird new world full of beautiful people, delicious food, and breathtaking sunrises. It was paradise, and then I woke up in a psych ward ten years later. The last week has been a blur, what the doctors are calling a medical miracle. I‚Äôve been picking up the pieces of my life and after considering the options, Stella, if you‚Äôre still out there, I just woke up from paradise. I have the same phone number.

But here‚Äôs the thing‚Äîwithout a good battery, that hero is benched. 

Whether you‚Äôre running a gym, office, or community center, knowing how to keep your AED‚Äôs battery in tip-top shape isn‚Äôt just smart‚Äîit‚Äôs life-saving. Let‚Äôs break it down in plain talk, no jargon. 

Plus, we‚Äôll show you why **BuyAEDIndia** is the go-to for keeping your AED rescue-ready.

# Which Defibtech AED Do You Have? Here‚Äôs the Battery Lowdown

Defibtech makes AEDs that are tough and user-friendly, but each model needs the right battery. Here‚Äôs your no-nonsense guide:

1. **Lifeline AED (DCF-100)** :
   * **Battery Options** :
      * **DBP-1400** : Lasts 5 years if unused. Good for low-traffic spots (think small offices).
      * **DBP-2800** : A 7-year powerhouse for busy places (gyms, malls, schools).
2. **Lifeline AUTO** :
   * Uses the same batteries as the Lifeline AED. Easy peasy!

**Heads-Up** : Mixing batteries is like using a toaster in a bathtub‚Äîbad news. Always match the battery to your AED model.

# How Long Do These Batteries Actually Last?

Batteries don‚Äôt last forever, even if your AED sits unused. Here‚Äôs the scoop:

* **Standby Time** :
   * **5-Year Battery (DBP-1400)** : Up to 5 years if it‚Äôs just chilling. But if the AED starts beeping? Swap it ASAP.
   * **7-Year Battery (DBP-2800)** : A marathon runner‚Äî7 years of standby life. Perfect for places where emergencies are rare but critical.
* **Shock Power** :
   * **DBP-1400** : 125 shocks or 8 hours of monitoring.
   * **DBP-2800** : 300 shocks or 16 hours of runtime.
* **Battery Killers** :
   * Heat, humidity, and rough handling. Store your AED in a cool, dry spot‚Äî*not* a car trunk or leaky basement.

**Pro Tip** : Batteries don‚Äôt care if you ‚Äúnever use them.‚Äù They degrade over time. Replace them by the expiration date‚Äîno excuses.

# Replacing the Battery: Easier Than Making Coffee

Changing a Defibtech battery is so simple, you‚Äôll wonder why you ever stressed about it:

1. **Step 1** : Flip the AED on its side. Press the battery release button (it‚Äôs like ejecting a DVD, but way more important).
2. **Step 2** : Pop out the old battery. Slide in the new one until it clicks.
3. **Step 3** : The AED will beep or light up green. Done!

**Don‚Äôt Be That Person** : Tossing old batteries in the trash? Recycle them instead. BuyAEDIndia can hook you up with eco-friendly disposal.

# Keep Your AED Ready: Do These Things!

An AED isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúset it and forget it‚Äù gadget. Stay sharp with these habits:

1. **Monthly Check-Ins** :
   * Defibtech AEDs self-test daily, but you should eyeball the status light. Green = good. Red or beeping = replace the battery NOW.
2. **Expiration Dates Matter** :
   * Write the battery‚Äôs expiry date on your calendar. Set a reminder 6 months early to order a new one.
3. **Swap Pads Too** :
   * Electrode pads expire every 2‚Äì5 years. Replace them with the battery‚Äîbecause dead pads = no rescue.
4. **Avoid Sketchy Deals** :
   * Cheapo batteries from random websites might fail when lives are on the line. Stick with **BuyAEDIndia** for the real deal.

# Why BuyAEDIndia is Your Defibtech BFF

When you need Defibtech batteries in India, **BuyAEDIndia** has your back:

* **Legit Products** : They sell **DBP-1400** and **DBP-2800** batteries‚Äîno fakes, no guesswork.
* **Fast Shipping** : No waiting weeks for shipments from Timbuktu. They deliver across India pronto.
* **Expert Help** : Got questions? Their team guides you on everything from installation to recycling.

**Bonus** : They offer **battery-and-pad bundles** to save you cash. Smart, right?

# The Stupidest Way to Save Money: Cheap Batteries

Sure, a $10 battery on eBay looks tempting. But here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs a disaster waiting to happen:

* **Fake Batteries Fail** : They might not deliver enough juice to restart a heart.
* **Legal Trouble** : Non-certified batteries could violate safety laws. Imagine explaining *that* to a lawyer.

**Real-Life Horror Story** : A customer collapses in your store. You grab the AED, but the cheap battery dies mid-analysis. That‚Äôs a life lost over saving a few bucks.

# Your Game Plan: Stay Ready, Save Lives

1. **Check Your AED Today** : Look at the battery‚Äôs expiration date. If it‚Äôs close, order a replacement from **BuyAEDIndia** *now* .
2. **Train Your Team** : Make sure everyone knows how to swap batteries and pads.
3. **Monthly Checks** : Add it to your routine‚Äîlike watering plants, but way more urgent.

Your Defibtech AED is a lifeline. Treat its battery like the VIP it is.

I am still struggling with optimizing trade routes. I am on the verge of entering the late game (only DLC1 enabled for now, just for context) and have following scenario as an example and I guess your advice will help me adjust in similar situations.

Coffee and rum are two goods that are notoriously know to be well-sought from differnent inhabitants.

So I have a whole island dedicated to coffee production and want to distribute coffee to 4 other inhabited islands in the new world, crown falls and my main island in the old world. I have high production and storage at the production island, but still struggle to distribute coffee to every inhabited world.

What I am doing right now is: I have a circle route (A) that constantly circles all 5 islands in the old world (about 5-6 ships in the fleet) and keep a constant supply on the most common goods like Tortillas, Ponchos, Baked Bananas as well as coffee. This circle works kinda okay.

Now I have another big distribution route (B) that only takes coffee (6 slots in cargo steam ship) first to Crown Falls and then surplus to my main island in the Old World.

Problems I face: when fleet B arrives to the production island it drains much supply (up to the minimum supply of about 200) from the storage. Something like 5x6x50 tons. The supply at the production island still varies, depending on when other ships arrive.

Also need to supply the Arctic soon with coffee‚Ä¶ Also have the same problem with other goods as rum and to a smaller extent glasses, sewing mashines, canned goods, fur coats and so on.

What would be better? Having 1-3 ship for every consumption island. Put fleets A and B together to one big circle that cycles every island in every region? Any other suggestions? Keep fleets dedicated to one good (6 slots of coffee, 6 slots of rum and so on) or have ships with different goods on the same cycle?",1,1740997770.0,anno1800,0,1.0,False

Auto drivers here don‚Äôt use meters‚Äîthey use *astrology* to calculate fares. *""Sir, Mars is in retrograde, so ‚Çπ800 to Besant Nagar.""*

The meme game here is like a *Vijay TV rerun*:  
- **Template 1:** Rajinikanth walking away from an explosion.  
  *Caption:* ‚ÄúTN politicians leaving accountability debates.‚Äù

### **5. ‚ÄúCulture‚Äù = Conspiracy Theories + Coffee**  
One post: *""Appreciating Bharatanatyam‚Äôs grace.""*  
Next post: *""Why RRR is a Brahminical propaganda tool.""*  
Comments section: A PhD thesis on how *Pushpa* disrespects Tamil Nadu‚Äôs *agri-cultural heritage*. Meanwhile, someone‚Äôs flexing their *""100% pure Tamil""* baby names list (*‚ÄúI named my child Sangamithra, not Sanskritized Sangeeta!‚Äù*).

### **6. Mods: The Supreme Court of Sambar**  
The mods here run the sub like a *filter coffee dictator*:  
- *Criticize Dravidianism?* **Banned.**  
- *Call Chennai heat ‚Äúmanageable‚Äù?* **Banned.**  
- *Post a meme comparing Stalin to Thanos?* **Pin it to the top.**  
Their rules are as consistent as *Chennai‚Äôs metro timing*‚Äîmythical.

### **Final Burn:**  
r/TamilNadu is like a *theppa kutti paniyaram*‚Äîcrispy outside, chaotic inside, and 90% hot air. But hey, where else can you watch someone quote *Silappathikaram* to own a sanghi, then pivot to arguing about *Anirudh‚Äôs DJ mix vs. AR Rahman‚Äôs legacy*? Never change, da. You‚Äôre the *Ultra Pro Max* of regional subs. üî•

1j2fnux,https://www.reddit.com/r/hygiene/comments/1j2fnux/female_body_scent_that_i_cant_detect_occurs_only/,Female body scent that I can't detect occurs only at work.,"I'm a 19-year-old woman with a solid hygiene routine‚ÄîI brush my teeth twice daily, shower twice a day, and change out of sweaty clothes right after work. I work in a small coffee shop, and my coworkers occasionally comment that it smells bad when I‚Äôm around, describing it as a fishy odor. I‚Äôve been tested for infections, but everything came back normal.

I deal with anxiety-induced sweating and use Drysol, but even with it on, I sometimes notice a fart-like smell filling the room within 15 minutes. I can‚Äôt tell if it‚Äôs me or the bathroom, which had a busted pipe (since fixed) but still smells off. I suspect it‚Äôs anxiety-related odor, but I‚Äôm desperate for solutions for both armpit and intimate area hygiene. My family says I don‚Äôt smell when I come home, so I‚Äôm at a loss. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",36,1740997451.0,hygiene,55,0.94,False
