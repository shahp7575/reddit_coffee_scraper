1fvmx5f,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Frosty_Incident666/comments/1fvmx5f/oc_why_doe_jyx/,[OC] Why Doe [jyx],"Jane Doe, whose parents had the unfortunate surname of ""Doe"" and an even more unfortunate sense of humor, woke up in what appeared to be unfamiliar quarters. Her head was hurting, a result of a minor concussion. Looking around she noticed a somewhat nice table, albeit far outdated from the more modern fashions of interior design, with some food on it. A card had been placed next to it, upright, as well as some drinks. 

""Dear Mrs. Doe"" she read, ""we really didn't want it to turn out like this. But alas, s\*\*\* happens. You have experienced a minor concussion while one of ours was carrying you away from the research facility on Terra. Luckily the recent chaos with the machines and all came in quite handy in this ~~kidnapping~~ acquisition operation. Rest assured, we meant and mean you no harm. Your particular set of skills in xenogenetics is required for something we're trying to accomplish. We *would* have asked you nicely, but you know how things are on Terra. We're not exactly welcome there. Please strengthen yourself with these refreshments. Unlike hotels in Terra, these are completely complimentary. We didn't know what you liked, so we just had our guy create a small selection for you. We're looking forward to working with you! -S"".

Her head still pounding she muttered ""What the fuck?"". Her last memories where that the security forces of her outpost being were overwhelmed, not by machines but by something entirely different. She counted seventeen different species amongst the attackers, only some of which were human. Particularly, a man in a pink armored suit stood out, who swiftly grabbed her. Then everything went dark. She could've sworn she had seen this exact suit somewhere before, but she couldn't figure out where. Her gaze wandered around the room, towards a camera installed in one of the corners.

""What the fuck? Who are you people?"" she screamed at it. She tried to open the door the room. 

""I'm sorry, I can't let you do that"" a calm, robotic voice came over the speakers, ""but rest assured, you are safe here. There's some medicine in the first drawer in that cabinet. Your ... employers would have rather let you die than fall into our hands. Your lucky our boy shielded you from that blast, although he couldn't avoid you getting hurt. Again, we're truly sorry for that"". 

Jane was scared. Never in her life had she experienced anything like this and never in her life had she seen any actual violent conflict of this magnitude. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

""Was that really necessary?"" Rakke asked, ""Maybe she would've gone with us peacefully if we had just asked Tythor to ask her?""

""It was"" Süpö replied in a grim tone, ""Tythors out of commission for the time being. Has to tend to his business and all. Inspections coming up too. And he's trying to buy some kind of computer? Plus...she's been working in an underground facility on Terra. No idea on what. They wouldn't have let her go, even if she wanted to.""

""How did you know that? He said he wanted to keep it a surprise until he revealed it to the ship. There are some who are betting on which system he'll be using. Personally I think he'll go for *Essixs Software Dimension*"".

""Of course you do"" Süpö replied, yellow as can be, ""I know because I told him where to look. Well, not him directly. I sent a message to John, claiming to be somebody from the Theseus, which wasn't a lie. He just didn't know it was me"". 

""I thought you hated him? He said he had 20 missed calls from you, when you were so pissed about him bringing disorder to the ship?""

""Appearances"" Süpö admitted, ""I do kind of like him, for a Rakhar, all the banter aside. You'll never tell him this, you hear me? That's an order!""

""Loud and clear, Kapt'an. But your reasons are beyond me"". 

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Another voice came through the speaker. ""I'm the kabdain of this ship"" it spoke, ""and would like to welcome you onboard. Again, it *was* unfortunate that things turned out this way. Their resistance was stronger than we anticipated"". 

""What ship?"" Jane asked, still weary, still afraid.

""That I cannot tell you. Yet. It's all for a good purpose. What we *need* is your particular set of skills. Your output matches our requirements. Anyways, help yourself to some refreshments. They're from the best place in the Galaxy. Fresh too! Don't worry, they aren't poisoned or anything. If we wanted you dead, *you'd already be-*""

""Way to go, father. Now she's ain't gonna have any appetite"" she heard over the intercom, a voice she faintly recognized. It was the guy who grabbed her. His voice sounded a lot softer when he wasn't barking orders.

""Really, son? She'll get around eventually. We're being sincere after all...we need her. The Squishies ain't coming back with our level of understanding. We need an expert. Wait shit is that thing still on? Fuck. So anyways, Mrs. Doe, we'll give you some privacy. See it as a sign of our trust. Oh and please don't try to escape. We're in space. And that room ... well it's on the outer hull. Wouldn't want you to become a human soup floating in space, now would we?"". The indicator on the camera turned off. She didn't trust them, so she put a blanket over the camera, sat down and cried.

Some time later, she heard a knock on the door. Taking whatever blunt instrument she could find - in this case, a table lamp - she hid behind the door. 

""I'm Tay"" she heard a muffled voice through the door, ""they asked me to check in on you. Now before you do anything rash, I just want to say - *before coming in* - please don't do anything rash. I wasn't involved in the raid. Furthermore...even if you managed to overpower me, which I don't really think is all that unlikely to be honest, you're on a ship in space. There is nowhere to go. They'd find you eventually. So let's just try to make this least awkward for the both of us. *Release all restrictions on Room 67-H*"". Jane heard the locking mechanism of the door. ""There's a button next to the door, try pressing that. If that doesn't work, I'll go get a crowbar. Sometimes the doors to this room jam. Old ship, you know?""

The door did indeed open, although it was an exercise in patience and sounded like it was about to break down. A man of somewhat taller stature than the man who grabbed her was revealed. Obviously civilian, considering his clothing was more fashionable than most workwear was. They were, however, a bit strange, made from a material and with patterns unfamiliar to Jane. 

""Again, I'm Tay. Pleasure to make your acquaintance"", the man introduced himself again. He looked at the table lamp she was holding with an iron grasp, ready to strike at any given second. ""Please, that would really not be necessary"" he said in a calm manner. For some reason, he seemed trustworthy. Like he'd never hurt a fly in his life. She did notice a small pink firearm on his belt, but he didn't seem like he intended to use it, or had ever used it. 

""Pleasure"" she responded dryly, ""so can you tell me what all this is about?"". She was still grasping the lamp.

""I'm sorry. I don't really understand it either. They just want to *bring something back.* That's all they told me. It seems important to them. Despite what you may have experienced, they *aren't* bad people"" Tay explained, ""I'm sure the Kapt'an will fill you in"".

Having no choice she decided to drop the lamp, which promptly broke from the impact. 

""Shame, the previous inhabitant of this place really liked this lamp"" Tay sighed. 

""And where is this previous owner now?"" Jane inquired.

""In the wall, of course"" Tay answered. That ""in the wall"" had a different meaning for people who had no knowledge of the fleet-ship did not cross his mind at all. 

""*In the wall? You're telling me you have people living in your walls*?"" 

""Oh that came out wrong. Where to begin? Although we *do technically* have people living in our walls"" Tay remarked, his hand rubbing his chin, ""although not humans"". He thought of the Dusts, some of which found that the electrical system of the Fleet-Ship was an appropriate, even luxurious place to live in. 

The researcher didn't seem to know what to make of this information. 

""Anyways, it's paramount you protect that brain of yours. They gave you emergency medical attention as soon as we had your in our care. Whoever worked with you really didn't want you here. Not that it matters anyways"" Tay pointed towards the sustenance she didn't dare to touch. ""It's safe"" he said, eating some of it, ""Tythor really does have the best produce"". 

""Tythor?"" Jane asked, ""I've heard some of our delivery guys talk about such a person. They really seem to like him. Don't know who that is supposed to be, however. I've spent most of my time underground. Wasn't allowed to go outside. Contract and all. NDAs. You know the drill, probably"".

""I don't. I only do housework at home. Tythors a good friend of mine, really. And of my husbands. Of my entire family, really."" Tay replied. 

""Husband? Family?"" Jane inquired. 

""Yeah, my husband Rakke. And his wife, Roxxa. And our children. Our daughter and my husbands ... child? Neither male nor female, really"" Tay answered. The woman raised an eyebrow. ""So you're one of *those*? How old are those children?"" Tay started counting. ""And what about the other child? The fluid one?"".

""That's a bit more complicated. Technically, as old as time itself. I mean that one is from another father...well technically it's it's own father...I'm not making any sense, am I?"" Tay replied slightly embarrassed trying to explain the situation. ""You'll come to understand when you meet them"" he finally muttered. The woman looked at him like he was insane.

""And what are their names?"" Jane continued her investigation. 

""Well Rakkes...child...is called Essix. And for out daughter, she doesn't have a name yet. Hasn't come of age yet. I just call her *Lil' Rox.""* Tay answered. ""Man the Kapt'an was pissed when he found about it. Luckily he didn't follow through on his threat to keep Rakke grounded until our daughter was an adult."".

""You are some strange people"" Jane answered, drinking what they had offered her. It was some kind of lemonade.

""Kapt'an wanted to gift you a bottle of booze, but the doctors said no"" Tay admitted, ""shame. I hear it's really good. Anyways, you feeling well enough to meet the Kapt'an?""

""I'd rather not, but what choice do I have? Let's get it behind us"" Jane replied.

Tay lead her away from the room, checking a small device on his arm. The hallways of the ship were not laid out in any particular manner, as if the ship had grown organically over time. 

""What's with the gun?"" Jane eventually asked as they were walking along the corridors. 

""Oh this old thing? It's a gift from my husband. Never really used it. Don't really see the appeal in these things. He has a knack for them tho. Figures. He survived the Grrkrk invasion when he was a child, after all. Doesn't go anywhere without one really"" Tay explained, ""he's a bit weird in this regard. Demands I wear it all times"". 

Sometimes they had to cross somebodies private quarters to advance on their way to the bridge, the inhabitants being humans, aliens or humans and aliens. As a xenogeneticist she found this type of diversity delightful. 

""So does your husband hate them? The Grrkrk?"" she attempted some small talk.

""Not really. I mean his sibling is a Grrkrk. Funny enough his Grrkrk sibling, who doesn't talk too much usually, ended up as some kind of leader for the Grrkrk. Despite trying to kill my husbands father on multiple occasions"".

""And his father being?"" Jane was intrigued. It was obvious that this man had lost his marbles. 

""Why, his father is a Jyx. Adopted him. Nice one, most of the time. Well unless he's not. Say what you will about the Jyx, but they are loyal"" Tay answered truthfully. 

""So you're telling me. Your husband, who is the adopted son of a Jyx and who also adopted a Grrkrk, despite the ... relations ... between the two species, had an extra-marital affair with some alien and thus fathered the same alien? And you, another woman and him have a child together?"" Jane summarized sarcastically.

""Yes. That's almost exactly what I'm telling you"" Tay confirmed, ""Ah, the bridge. I hate these floor plans..."" 

\_\_\_\_\_\_

The bridge was not what Jane had expected at all. For all the organization, efficiency and discipline these people had displayed when grabbing her, they were the exact opposite. She made out a man in a pink suit, speaking to some sort of machine. Of course she did what had to be done: She went up to the man in the pink suit and slapped him.

""Should've kept the helmet on. It's true what they say: A helmet makes everything nicer!"" somebody with a Teu'th accent laughed at the pink-suited man. He did not retaliate.

""Honestly I deserved that one"" the man said instead. 

""Not the worst thing you've done, to be honest"" something holding a teacup and cookies said. It was neither human or really alien.

""No, that would've been you"" the man in pink said in a teasing manner.

""Allow me to introduce you. This machine here, well that's the Kapt'an. The man in pink here is Rakke, my husband, and also Kapt'an. And that one over there, whose appearance may depend on your perception of it, is Essix. A cosmic sentience. And my husbands child"" Tay introduced them, ""everyone, this is Jane Doe. Xenogeneticist. Hopefully she won't be too apprehensive about helping you all out, despite the circumstances. She did not appreciate the way you invited her to this ship"". 

""It's a pleasure to be finally meeting you. I am truly sorry about all this. But we've had no other choice. I'm Süpö. Kapt'an of the Theseus fleet-ship. Now you've been probably asking yourself why we went through all this trouble"" Süpö explained. She didn't seem to know who Süpö was, which was a refreshing change of pace.

""The thought had crossed my mind. Elaborate"" Jane demanded.

""Well you see, we've been in space for a looooooooooooooong time. And when we started our journey, our rather, our ancestors, well your ancestors really, there was an alien race that helped them out. Sadly however, they ended up dying out. Something about being out-competed or something? Before they went into extinction they made sure that they gave us as much information on them as they could. We had believed that information to be lost. Recently we've come across something that would help us fulfill an old promise. We'd like you too look over that information, given your expertise"" Süpö started.

""An alien race?"" Jane asked befuddled, ""one that hasn't existed for a long time?""

""Yes"" Süpö replied ""many on this ship grew up with tales of them. They were quite fond of said race. Some of us carry genetic markers that can be traced back to them. Apparently they did something in order to survive? Anyways. We have a vial of material collected from them"".

""And how old is this sample material you have?"" the researcher asked.

""Give or take one thousand years, plus/minus a couple hundred. Bear in mind their tech was very different from ours. It's worth giving a shot"" somebody on the bridge chimed in. 

""And that race was?""

""We just called them *Squishies*. Three-fingered, blueish, breathed in a different atmosphere?"" another person gave some context, ""I doubt they appear in your records. If they do, probably in the archives of some corporation that doesn't want that information public"".

""And what exactly do you want to accomplish with all that information?"" Jane asked intrigued. She hadn't expected this. No, she wouldn't have been surprised if an alien government tried to stop her research, given it's nature, but this? They didn't have any interest in her other research at all. 

""We want to bring them back. We've promised them that much, and we intend to keep that promise"" Süpö replied. 

""I mean...it sounds near impossible really but I'll be happy to take a peak"" Jane said after some thought, ""I'd need a lab though. I don't think the facilities here would be enough?""

""We're working on that, but we need your input. You know with what you work best, after all. By the way, when is the last time you have seen some sunlight?"" Rakke asked, his face still red from slapping he got earlier.

""Loooong time"" the woman replied, ""we had artificial stuff, but it doesn't come close to the real thing"".

""Well then. Prepare for landing."" Süpö commanded, being the order being echoed by Rakke.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""This is where you'll be living, given you accept. Don't mind the guards, they're there for your protection should anybody be dumb enough to try to kidnap you back. Or liquidate you, which is more likely"" Rakke said, which resulted in a prompt slap from Tay, who decided to take over the task of introducing their new guest to FUSS.

""Anyways, these houses are built in the traditional way. Not the same as on Terra. I hope you don't mind"" he carried on. 

""You're saying I get an entire house to myself?"" Jane asked, ""An entire house?"". She couldn't believe it. The quarters in her lab back on Terra weren't bad, they were quite luxurious in fact. But she never had any privacy. ""Where are the bugs?""

""Bugs? I hope there aren't any. They're annoying"" Tay answered confused, ""buzzing around and all that"". 

""No, the listening devices?"" she tried to clarify?

""What, you think we'd spy on you? The only reason we had a camera in your room on the ship was so we could make sure you were alright. You did suffer a concussion after all. We don't do that here. Privacy and all?"" Tay answered slightly unnerved.

""And you're telling me this entire two-story house is mine?"". She still couldn't believe it.

""Yes. It may not have all the amenities as on Terra, but it's a fine house. They would've asked you to design and furnish it yourself, but alas, that wasn't really possible, now was it?"".

""An entire house?"". 

""Yes? I told you already?"".

""To myself?"".

""Yes. Anyways, that's where you will live. Where you will work is somewhere else. Shall we take a tour or would you prefer some rest? Get acquainted with the locals?""

They went to a group of people gathered around a strange clay structure. It turned out they were making coffee and some food, welcoming the woman warmly. 

\_\_\_\_\_\_

""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-"" the General screamed, ""FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU-"". The soldiers in the complex were very unnerved at his outburst. 

""Does this mean they declared war on us?"" somebody finally gathered to courage to ask. 

""This facility isn't on the books"" the General replied, ""in the grand scheme of things, nothing happened. I just hope to whatever is out there that she doesn't break. Nobody outside should know of this. Nobody....FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUU....""",1,1728002649.0,u_Frosty_Incident666,0,1.0,False

1fvmu0k,https://www.reddit.com/r/acidreflux/comments/1fvmu0k/doctors_have_given_me_silent_reflux_from_bad/,Doctors have given me silent reflux from bad medication and medication for reflux makes reflux worse. ,"So ages ago, I used to have an immune disorder.

I went to the doctors, and they gave me a bunch of meds that made me really sick and never cured my immune disorder.

I eventually said, ""Hey, your medication is messing me up,"" and then they said something about realizing they made a mistake and potentially did something to the bacteria in my stomach. I'm not too sure, but I ended up having reflux occasionally.

It's been a couple of years, and I went to a doctor, and he gave me some antacids. They didn't seem to work; only they made me not be able to swallow.

So I went and saw a specialist and paid like $1.5k, and he shoved a camera down my throat and said, ""Yep, you have silent reflux.""

He gave me a bunch of meds again that made me not be able to swallow. I couldn't friggin' swallow, and again I was feeling like ass.

I thought this guy sucks ass, and I paid $1.5k for nothing. Then he said maybe cutting out your tonsils will help.

I am a singer and was like, ""Nah, lol.""

I stopped taking meds and went on a no meat, no sugar, no dairy diet for like six weeks.

Didn't do much.

I can't take antacids because they give me dysphagia (can't swallow food and don't want to drink water).

Every now and then, I drink a large gulp of water and feel the acid in my esophagus burning to the point where I fall to the ground—that's how painful it is. Then it will only happen like maybe once or twice a week.

Not sure what to do since doctors suck, and I still have this problem.

I don't drink alcohol; I eat healthy, I play sports, I'm fit, and I don't indulge or binge eat junk food ever.

Occasionally, I eat chocolate—like occasionally. I do drink coffee, and even when I stopped coffee, I still had reflux.

So, I don't know, man. I do notice certain foods do make it obviously worse—like if I haven't eaten for a long time and I smack a huge plate of curry in my belly, I'm like, ""Yo, I can kinda feel it."" But I don't get heartburn; I just kinda know there's more acid than usual.

Don't know what to do.

1fvmo5g,https://www.reddit.com/r/myamazonreviews/comments/1fvmo5g/guide_how_to_choose_the_best_countertop_ice_maker/,Guide: How to Choose the Best Countertop Ice Maker for Your Needs,"If you're considering buying a countertop ice maker, it’s essential to know exactly what to look for. 

With so many models available, it's easy to get lost in the features, pros, and cons. 

Here's a practical guide to help you choose the best ice maker for your home, based on what really matters.

# 1. Understand Your Ice Needs

Before diving into specific brands or models, think about how much ice you actually need. Are you hosting large parties or simply looking to fill your glass of iced coffee every morning? Ice makers vary in capacity, typically producing between 25-50 pounds of ice per day. Choose a machine that aligns with your daily or event-based needs.

**Quick Tip:** If you frequently entertain guests or love hosting parties, aim for a higher-capacity model that produces at least 40 pounds of ice daily.

# 2. Types of Ice: Nugget, Cube, or Bullet?

Not all ice is created equal! There are several different types of ice that machines can produce, and your preference should dictate the type of machine you buy.

* **Nugget Ice:** Soft, chewable ice that’s great for cocktails, smoothies, or iced coffee.
* **Cube Ice:** Standard cubes, ideal for keeping drinks cold for a long time.
* **Bullet Ice:** Small, rounded pieces of ice, commonly found in budget-friendly machines.

Think about how you'll be using the ice. Nugget ice is popular for its texture, but if you just want basic ice cubes, a simpler machine will do the job.

# 3. Noise Level: How Loud is Too Loud?

Ice makers can be surprisingly noisy. While some machines quietly hum in the background, others produce more noticeable sounds — especially when they’re making ice. This can be a dealbreaker if you plan to keep the machine in a small or quiet space, like an apartment or office.

**Quick Tip:** If you're noise-sensitive, look for models with reviews that mention quiet operation, or plan to place the ice maker in a less frequented area of your home.

# 4. Size and Portability

Countertop ice makers come in a variety of sizes, and it's important to choose one that fits your available space. Measure your counter before purchasing to ensure the machine won't take up too much room or crowd other appliances. Also, consider portability — smaller machines are easier to move around for events or outdoor gatherings.

# 5. Speed of Ice Production

How quickly do you need ice? Some machines take 20-30 minutes to produce the first batch, while others can deliver ice in as little as 6-8 minutes. If you're in a hurry or entertain frequently, opt for a faster machine to avoid waiting for your ice to freeze.

**Quick Tip:** Machines that produce smaller amounts of ice quicker are perfect for individuals or smaller families, while larger households may need a machine that produces more ice over time.

# 6. Storage Capacity and Refilling

Once the ice is made, where does it go? Most machines come with a storage bin, but capacities vary widely. If you use a lot of ice at once, opt for a machine with a larger storage bin. Remember, most countertop ice makers are not freezers, so the ice will melt over time unless it's used or transferred to a freezer.

**Quick Tip:** For convenience, look for a machine with a storage bin that holds at least 2-3 pounds of ice at a time, and make sure it’s easy to refill the water tank when needed.

# 7. Maintenance and Cleaning

Ice makers require regular cleaning to prevent mold, limescale buildup, or bad odors. Some models have a self-cleaning function, which makes maintenance easier. However, for others, you'll need to clean the machine manually every few weeks.

**Quick Tip:** Opt for machines with a self-cleaning feature if you want to minimize maintenance. Otherwise, make sure you clean your machine regularly using a descaling solution or vinegar to keep the ice fresh and the machine running smoothly.

# 8. Water Source: Refillable Tank or Direct Line?

Most countertop ice makers come with a refillable water tank, but a few higher-end models can connect directly to a water line for continuous ice production. If you prefer a hassle-free experience and have the necessary setup, consider a machine that supports a direct water line.

# 9. Price vs. Features

More expensive doesn’t always mean better. Look at the features that matter to you. Do you need a machine with a large capacity, or is a faster, quieter machine more important? Establish a balance between price and functionality. Sometimes a budget-friendly model with fewer features is all you need for daily use.

# 10. Read User Reviews Carefully

Lastly, always read customer reviews before purchasing. Look for feedback on noise, durability, ease of use, and ice quality. Reviews are often the most honest source of information and will give you a clearer picture of the machine’s long-term performance.

# Conclusion:

Choosing the right countertop ice maker is all about matching your needs with the machine's capabilities. 

Whether you're after the perfect nugget ice for cocktails or need a workhorse for large events, prioritize key features like capacity, noise level, and ease of maintenance to find the best fit. With these considerations in mind, you'll be well on your way to enjoying perfectly chilled drinks all year round.",1,1728001900.0,myamazonreviews,0,1.0,False

It promised to churn out nugget-shaped ice — the kind that's perfect for cocktails and cold drinks — but after using it for several months, I have a few reservations. 

With a 3.5-star rating on Amazon and mixed reviews, I should have managed my expectations from the start.

# First Impressions:

When I unboxed it, I was impressed by the sleek stainless steel design and the easy-to-use touch screen. It looked like a solid addition to my kitchen, and the compact size made it fit perfectly on my countertop. But that's where the positive first impressions ended.

# My Experience Using It:

After filling the water tank, I hit the 'ICE' button and waited for the machine to do its magic. Here's what happened over the following days:

1. **Ice Quality:** The nugget ice it produces is good — soft and chewable, just as advertised. But it took much longer to get a full batch than I expected, and you need to refill it frequently.
2. **Noise Level:** This is where things started to go downhill. The machine is **incredibly loud**. It makes a constant humming sound, but what really bothered me was the loud squealing noise every time it made ice. I could hear it from rooms away, and it became a real nuisance.
3. **Durability Issues:** Within a few months, I noticed water leaking from the back. Not only did it damage my counter, but it also required constant monitoring and cleanup. And it wasn’t just a fluke — many other users on Amazon reported the same problem.
4. **Customer Service:** When I reached out to the company to address the leakage issue, they responded once asking for pictures and then went silent. It’s frustrating to invest this much money in a product only to have it break down so soon and then get ignored by customer service.

# The Good:

* **Ice Quality:** When it works, the ice is perfect for cocktails, iced coffee, and cooling drinks.
* **Compact Size:** It’s small enough to fit on most countertops without taking up too much space.
* **Touch Screen:** The intuitive touch controls make it easy to operate.

# The Bad:

* **Very Noisy:** The loud squealing noise is almost unbearable if you're in the same room. You might want to place it far from your main living space.
* **Water Leakage:** After just a few months, it started leaking, and based on other reviews, it’s not an isolated incident.
* **Slow Ice Production:** It doesn’t make ice fast enough to keep up with frequent use, especially if you’re hosting guests.
* **Customer Support:** I received no helpful follow-up from the manufacturer after my complaint.

# Final Thoughts:

For the price, I expected more from [this machine. ](https://lvnta.com/lv_fZHerUooKgloPbQhdn?url=https%3A%2F%2Famazon.com%2Fdp%2FB0977DWMP4)

While it does make soft, chewable ice, the noise, durability issues, and poor customer service make it hard to recommend. 

If you’re looking for a countertop ice maker, there are better options on the market that won’t frustrate you after a few months of use.",1,1728001838.0,myamazonreviews,0,1.0,False

1fvmn2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChildfreeIndia/comments/1fvmn2m/weekly_thread_for_childfree_indians_seeking/,Weekly Thread for Childfree Indians Seeking Friendships,"Hi, CFI!

Welcome to our Weekly Friendship Thread, where childfree Indians can connect and build friendships. Whether you're looking for friends in your city or online, this is the place to be!

# A Few Things to Note:

1. **No CF4CF**: 'CFI Friendships' threads are for those seeking only platonic friends, either IRL or online. This is not the place to seek romantic interests; for that, you can create CF4CF posts on Sundays instead. If you spot any lovebirds in the wrong nest, feel free to give us a heads-up! 
2. **Stay Safe!** Use common sense and caution when talking to any stranger online.
3. **DM Etiquette:** By commenting here, you agree to be open to DMs from those seeking CFI friends (strictly platonic, unless you also post a CF4CF). Unsolicited dating or creepy messages will lead to a ban and a report to Reddit admins.
4. **Share About Yourself:** Help others get to know you better. Share your age, hobbies, city, gender (though our TwoX comrades might want to be cautious due to unsolicited attention). 
5. **Posting Flexibility:** Feel free to create posts outside of this thread to seek childfree Indian friends - use our new post flair 'CFI Friendships'. The CF4CF rules don’t apply to friendship seekers, so you can post any day, in any format, as long as you follow the other rules of CFI (see the sidebar for rules).
6. **City-Based Groups:** There are various city-based CF groups (none affiliated with this subreddit) on Telegram, Discord, WhatsApp, or Facebook. Give those a try too!
7. **Meetups:** We encourage you to join or host a city-wide CF meetup if you can.
8. **CFI Reddit Chat:** Connect more organically in [CFI's only official chat channel](https://chat.reddit.com/room/!QjYaQOe1QEW4oYdhE8OxMg%3Areddit.com)—already home to over 1,700 members! Struggling to join? Shoot a DM to any mod.

Examples:

> ""Hey CFI, It's Keanu here (yes, the one and only), dodging diapers like I dodge bullets in The Matrix. Living in Mumbai these days and looking for pals to ride motorcycles with or discuss philosophy over coffee. Drop a DM if you're into low-key hangouts and high-key debates!""   
>  
> ""Greetings, CFI! Bruce here from Gotham. By night, I fight crime; by day, I'm just your average billionaire. Into tech, martial arts, and nocturnal expeditions. Seeking fellow night owls who appreciate justice, complex gadgets, and the occasional brooding on rooftops. If you're up for discussing philosophy or the ethics of vigilante justice over coffee, let's connect over DM.""   
>  
>""Hello CFI! It's Vidya Balan here, loving life and breaking stereotypes one role at a time. I'm all about deep conversations and meaningful connections, but for now, I'm keeping things virtual. Not quite ready for in-person meetups—think of it as the interval before the big finale.   If you're into thoughtful chats and connecting from the comfort of your own space, let's link up over DM!""

1fvmn10,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1fvmn10/starting_tomorrow_are_you_me/,"Starting tomorrow, are you me?","Doctor has agreed to give me a trial of Ritalin.

I guess what I'm looking for here is if anyone's story matches mine, to get an idea of what are the kinds of effects/likelihood of success.

I'm in my forties. Been overweight most of my life, but not obese. Moderate binge eater all my life.

Looking for anyone who had anxiety and/or high blood pressure before they started treatment and their experience. 

Biggest ADHD problems (apparently I have them all): 

- Terrible short term memory 
- Have always hated sitting for long periods of time, and get anxiety from it (church as a kid, work meetings). I *hate* it
- I interrupt people regularly. I get a thought in my head, and then start being spastic trying to find a spot to interject in a conversation. 
- All my high octane jobs in the past came with notable coffee or red bull addiction
- Terrible emotional regulation. Go from zero to catastrophizing at breakneck speed. If too many people are talking loudly, I get annoyed then pissed. Overreact constantly.
- Wife says I am incapable of ""doing nothing"". It makes me uncomfortable and feel lazy

If I could sum up the biggest problem: 

My brain has always gone ""too fast"". I overthink absolutely everything. If I'm driving, I find myself scrutinizing the behaviour of everyone around me.  ""I bet this guy coming up fast behind me is going to cut into the inside lane then cut off that white Subaru"" and so on. I. Hate. It.

Pretty sure it's super ADHD, and I'm sure the treatment is going to help, but nervous about getting anxiety/panic attacks, or blood pressure skyrocketing. On the other hand I wonder if the ADHD has been the blood pressure/anxiety problem the whole time (since my early 20s).

I could use some psyching up for starting tomorrow, if your story is mine.

I’m 40 years old, I’ve been suffering from chronic acid reflux for 5 years, and I’m experiencing symptoms of hormonal imbalance. Yayyy!!!!

I recently decided to do everything I can to age healthily and get rid of my digestive issues. In addition to nutritional changes, I’ve decided to quit caffeine and… alcohol.

I don’t see myself as having an addiction, but it’s  definitely a bad habit. I drink often, sometimes 6-8 days in a row but in small amounts. I can go up to 4 drinks on special occasions but I don't like the feeling of being drunk. It’s often a way to relax after long days at work . I frequently take breaks from drinking for 2 to 8 weeks, but I’d like to quit for good because even in moderation, it’s unhealthy.

Just like quitting coffee, fast food, and dairy, I feel it’s going to be tough to stop drinking alcohol, especially with my active social life. I know I’m capable, but I need tools to help maintain my efforts, as I tend to easily give up on my attempts.

I need tips and your encouragement, which I’ll read over and over during my journey! 🥲🫶

Thank you.

Me and my family were being stalked and hunted by a werewolf. It was so vivid to the point it felt like it was real so as you can imagine I was extremely relieved when I awoke from it...but that relief wouldn't last long. 

Later that day I told my mom about the dream because she was in it with me. Both of us were being hunted by this werewolf. Well my mom got real creeped out when I told her about it and when I asked why she informed me that it was a full moon that night 🤨 it sent shivers down my spine and gave me goosebumps right when she told me and still does to this day when I think about it. 

Another odd thing is that I can still vividly remember this dream like it was yesterday which is not normal for me at all, I always forget my previous nights dreams by the time I've had my first cup of coffee if I even remember them at all. Yet I can pretty much play the entirety of the werewolf dream in my head like a movie to this day 🤔

I know that in Slavic and Phillipino folklore, vampires can attack you in your dreams. And the C.I.A. has done experiments on dreaming and REM sleep and hypothesize that our consciousness is transported to a different dimension/plane of existence during the REM cycle. 

Any insights, info, theories on what it could possibly mean would be greatly appreciated!! And what are the odds of having a dream of being hunted by a werewolf during a full moon?? It would be weird enough but understandable if I had known it was going to be a full moon that night, but I had no idea until my mom told me the next day!!

 (//: I tend to say this a lot, I've noticed. I ""need things to be in my face"" honestly based off the simple fact I've noticed I tend to misinterpret things. I believe this statement was an attempt at clarifying that frustration - feeling left in the unknown of things.)


The annoying part is I want a text, or a letter, or something - I want an apology, I want truth, and I want to know I am valued. I think that's what these feelings all boiled down to. (//: 'Sup, Self-Worth? Still struggling today? Remember that point we made for ourselves yesterday. We need to remember and remind ourselves these notions, because there aren't always going to be people around who *will*.)


It's going to be hard, but easier than I believe to trudge though this.. 

(//: Is this toxic positivity? Or is it a grasp at faith? I think a little bit of both.)

----

*Human, I hope you're okay.*

(//:  - Once again, a better idea to sink this here than to reach out.)


--- I think my brother is back in town. Dude still doesn't know I don't drink coffee. It's going to take everything inside me to not lose my temper.

(//: - this won't be resolved anytime soon. Still mad, told him I am still mad, and that I will talk to him eventually when I cool down.)


--- *fuck*. (//: - an exclamation!)


09:59 - Human, I need you. I really, really need you. (//: - Do I, though? I know I miss him. But I don't *need* them.)



--- 13:25

-My brother stopped by, then asked if I was mad at him and told him yes. It took a lot for me to not just start shouting. Lunch was forever away. Yeah man, I'm pretty pissed.

 (//:- still am.)

-What my buddy told me this morning before we opened still is bouncing around my brain. Sometimes I just wanna be like, *""Do you respect me? Do you even want to be my friend or like, have me in your life..?""* (//:- once again, those itchy gremlin fingers seeking validation..)

Ugh, I swear I've rolled my eyes so hard my eyeballs feel tight. 


(//:- It is an uncomfortable and yucky sound *AND* feeling.)


Something says to keep an open mind in the back of my head, but goodness I want to just clock then little voice. All I've done is *try* to keep an open mind and be patient.. all based off of what someone told me once.

 (//:- I've been both working on accepting that little virtue in myself of patience.. it has been a struggle at times, others not a bother in the slightest. The thing out of this here that I *need* to work on is not remembering all the little things. Or remembering offhand comments. It can basically be an earworm, a ruminating thought. I like to hold people to their word, just as I imagine they hold me to their own. My issue is I tend to hold the same expectations for others that I have for myself.)


There better be the best explanation I have ever heard..but let's be real with myself and that gremlin inside my head - I doubt one will come, and instead, I'll have to try and figure this out, by myself, without being able to talk to anyone that knows who I am, let alone that.. that.. *jerkface.*

 (//:- this is literally just that sad little fear of loneliness making itself heard. And once again, feeling as though my words don't have worth. Notice how I censor myself? That is due to the simple fact that as much as I *want* to call him rude, cruel names, I don't believe any of them. It's like Your Momma Jokes. I *love* them, but unless I know your mother is a terrible person, I feel real bad saying them. The same for name calling when I feel it is unwarranted. It's needless and rude. Though, sometimes it feels really nice being able to verbalize it. Think of the sensation each cuss word, each insult evoke when you say it with feeling. See how each one feels.
You really aren't always calling that person an *asshole*. Sometimes what you're really doing is releasing that burst of negativity from yourself. It sure as shit needn't stay trapped inside. The same line of thought of saying ""Fuck"" while in pain. It does something to the brain, endorphins.)


I swear, I'm the answer for some joke everyone knows but no one has bothered to tell me. I wish I could go home and just take a nap. I *know* I should be getting more stuff done around the house, but I can take a day off from it, I need to, Im killing myself.. I need to share the good things with the world and sit with them. I'm too frustrated from feeling unheard and disrespected and I don't like this sensation, whatsoever.


(//:- this is simply the fear of the unknown when you boil down to the seeds of this one. They're all different shapes, but it's all just *fear*.)


Stupid, dumb heart and and brain and soul. Dumb things holding hope for magic and care; I stupidly thought we were getting to this place.. and hey, same thing happened over and over with C..and then.. well.. 

(//:- this is a fear of repeating patterns and mistakes. And this is the *justbefore* when the soul acknowledges we've learned from them, we don't need to follow the same course. Yes, the jumps may have moved, and the barbedwire might be at different levels, but this is something we can navigate easier and easier with each try.
But have we ever simply just chosen *not* to do the course? I think it's reasonable to expect whomever turns out to be **my** *Human* to instead find me wandering around outside of this metaphorical place and go ziplining instead.

I don't need to do this sort of thing, ever again. I only crawled through that mud and put myself through Hell because I didn't value myself. Didn't love myself.

I thought I had to show people how much I could.. What I would, how far.. y'know? Always back to that ""if I do enough, then am I worth loving?"", when the reality is that I always *was*. We don't need to pour ourselves into people who don't want what we have to offer-we effectively only manage to waterboard then in the long run.)



Maybe it's best to take the heartbreak as it is now, pretend this fellow doesn't exist anymore, delete him from my phone, and just accept the fact this story never changes and that's why these stupid movies always do so well.

(//:- Is it heartbreak? Really? I think that's just sadness masquerading again as something more intense for attention. Truly an overdramatic reaction. 


*So what* if he has a girlfriend? This is either the same one, a different one, or one of many. I have no control over him, his actions, what he chooses to tell me.. but I can control *how* I react and feel about it. 

He wasn't mine to begin with, and at this rate, would I want him with everything? The gremlin inside, and most of me honestly still very much so says yes.

That's where rational brain comes in with the boundaries. That's where rational brain says ""No."" Not again. I am worth more than whatever the hell that was. 

It makes more sense now, looking back on things again. It's unfortunate that it does.


Ugh. *Fuck me..*

(//:- reign in the tempertantrum and go back to work.)
---


13:46- dammit..



*I feel so little and alone*

(//:-this is compounded by a feeling of helplessness, with a jagged edge of bitterness.)
----


15:16 -

I think I'm just upset in general over this farce. I was disrespected, lied to, and used and my work place is not somewhere I want to be right now.


I get why he wouldn't talk with me now. Instead of the truth, he'd rather see how far he could go with me without being honest...


...and I'm more sad than anything that I've lost someone special to me without having ever known them. Without having been given the chance. I've been honest and upfront since the very beginning, very clear. Or at least, I thought I was.


I met the person of my dreams, literally. A ghost who's face who has haunted me. I care in ways I don't think I have any right to anymore.


I hope the next time I see him, that he at least understands, and at least has the dignity to say goodbye to me, to my face. He was and is will be worth it to me, but I don't like who he is right now. His actions have shown me that I am not.


I will love his stupid ass regardless, and learn to accept the fact that perhaps no matter how bright and shiny and full of love that I am, sometimes it's just better to love knowing it won't be returned to myself... it's sucks, but perhaps it's a truth.


Tonight, I'll give myself some love and self-care. 


Here's to closing out this rolling storm.


Be safe, and take care *fool*


I'll *never* forgive you if something happens to you.



15:29

(//:- you can see where the real beginning of self-reflection starts; do I love him? Yes, but not in the way people tend to immediately jump to. It is an innocent love, and his presence makes me *happy*. Knowing he is alright makes my day better. Think of the childhood ability to love before you learned what trust really was. *Sort of like that*. 


I don't think I am ""in love"" with him, as I do not know him as a person. I could probably fall in love, as I am sure anyone could at anytime. It takes a lot to get to that point.
But I love him like I love my cat, like I love the color green, like the way I love clean fluffy socks, or six blankets on a chilly day sipping tea from my kitty cup.
It would be a lie to say I didn't have expectations. Though it would be *more* correct that I wanted to have not expectations. 

Overall, I am glad to have this person in my life, to have met them, to have gone through these unexpected challenges, and to have grown from them, and if I am correct, along side them. I hope to be comfortable in the knowledge that perhaps, they may be glad to have me in theirs, too, however it may not be as we like. On the other side of that coin, there are moments when I think it would be easier to severe the ties entirely entwine us, perhaps for both of us. I don't want that though, and I don't really know if that's my heart, or my soul that fight with my head and the data presented to me.


I think Rational Brain and Monkey Brain needed to Duke it out, and perhaps they always will - is it okay to have hope when you are attempting to make peace with the fact that hope is an illusion we tell ourselves? Can we look our mirror-reflection in the eyes and be okay with knowing that there is nothing and everything to know, that hope is just Schroedinger's Cat?


Fear of hope. Fear of losing hope. The desperation of clinging to hope. Anger at misplaced hope. Sadness at unrealized hope. Joy at hope having come through.


I think *hope* might just be a wish we're afraid to wish.


I'm glad looking back at this reflection that it honestly wasn't as too terrible or cringey as I thought it would have been. It did give rise to things I need to continue to work on, and has allowed me to keep some form of dignity in my personal life. It can be extremely uncomfortable and distressing to experience a torrent of uncontrollable-


Wait. *There it is*. Control.


The loss of it, the want of it, not having it.. control over my emotions. Control over my personal life. Control over my day to day interactions. Control over even my own thoughts and my own body. Wanting to have a say, being heard is wanting to have some Control over the outcome.


*I can't control the outcome.*


Monkey Brain is afraid of that, and even though Rational Brain is too, we're all working together to letting loose the chains that bind us.)",1,1728001424.0,trollshandwrites,0,1.0,False
1fvmgvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/idyll/comments/1fvmgvb/initial_thoughts/,Initial thoughts!,"Some initial thoughts!

Shopify didn’t update or track.
Box arrived a little battered and outer box opened up.
Inner box minor damage to corner.

The box:
Inside the box, there is a nice lay out, however I would like that protective material to be recycled or non plastic, and truly biodegradable.
For what is a relatively small base and pod unit. The box is large.
I could see better packing, likely reducing that by 1/3 size?.

The charger:
The charger is not a UK or EU plug type, so not worth having. It will be in land fill soon!
The cable seems fine? However, being white, doesn’t match the colours of the unit or the aesthetic of any other electrics I have. Perhaps white cable for white unit , black cable for black unit?
The unit doesn’t work with a ucb C charger like an iPhone charger , which I guess is 20w so I can understand maybe it needs higher watt levels.
So I got out the travel adaptor with usb c…
it doesn’t work in the usb c on this either.
However, it does work on the PD/QC option on the same unit.
The supplied charger / adapter unit , plugs in the travel adaptor and makes it work also.

So I would not take the supplied adaptor if I were to travel, and wouldn’t use it at home.

I think people should be aware that they need a PD/QC adaptor to use the unit.

General looks:
Its styling is getting very close to being a lovely addition.

The pod base:
The unit itself looks aesthetically nice.

The under neath of the wood, is chipped and marked and I would typically send that back as damaged.

The three silicone legs, are placed in a way that the unit tilts / tips backward when you place down the pod, meaning without the lid on, the pod and base will tilt and water will run the risk of spilling out over the back of the base, exactly where the usb c input is.

I like the small almost hidden nature of the green light, to see it is with power, but not in your face, or lighting the room.
I hate having large LED lights from all the units plugged in, which means all need turning off at the wall or unplugging before sleep, and also means unsuitable to charge during the night if battery operated .
The idea of white or blue light, makes me think it would also play an input on blue light exposure if used in the evenings, before using retainers.
Guess this is a preference thing, however some people are moving toward blue and white light avoidance in the evenings.

The base has points of water ingress risk.
Which I think when using an electrical item which requires water or liquid use, is not ideal. May limit the long term durability of the unit, and also is a little behind the current manufacture trends of water resistance and water proof units, allowing for bathroom use or kitchen use.
Making it something I wouldn’t leave in a bathroom or kitchen, for safety reason’s.

The pod:
The pod itself,
The paint is inconsistent on the bottom part , with paint over the intended area on one part and under the intended area on another part.
This is enough that I would typically return an item.

It is a little difficult to get the lid to begin to sit correctly.
Once screwed on, the lip sits a little off from the lower portion of the pod, like the lid is slightly misshaped, or sits funny due to the screw mechanism.

The lid is secure with the seal inside, which is likely a silicone seal. However, I don’t recall being told about that, so just make sure people know of it, as a silicone seal is still a plastic, and although more stable? Is still leaching chemicals.

The inside of the pod seems to have minor scratching already.
Also it needed a good clean on unboxing from small bits in the pod unit.

The pod is too heavy and large to carry, and certainly is if it had water in it, and I wouldn’t use it day to day.

I think the smoother corners, allow it to slip in pockets and bag pockets or a jacket easier, and without risk of the pod sharp corners, causing damage to other items or the pocket itself.
The idea of a sharper corner of the pod would in my opinion only work if was not used to take the pod out, and when only stainless steel colour .
If the painting / coating of the pod is at a sharper corner, I would anticipate is starting to wear off , or on delivery not be as consistent, on the sharper corners/edges.

The smoother rounder corners is slightly softer on the eye in the room, and blends in well with other designs often seen in a similar space.

The underneath of the pod, had some small scratches.
The glueing is inconsistent, spilling out of needed point at places, making the unit feel cheaper and sticky / tacky, and more plastic like. Almost sticky dirty.
Like I want to clean it off, as it feels off in the hand, or when transported. I would always be checking if it needs a clean before putting it away.

The pod sits on the base ok.
However if it were a larger / taller pod, I would worry it could slip off easily, damage, or spill contents on to other items.
This maybe an issue for the idea of using a coffee system or similar on top.

Use:
A bit difficult to fit the two retainers, bottoms and top in at the same time.
Likely needs a deeper water line, or wider?.
However, I am always a fan of less is better, and having it a smaller and more space efficient unit is always a good aim, so I am a little uncertain what to suggest.

I am able to make holes in half of the foil, not the whole foil, indicating insufficient spread of ultrasonic .
I can’t seem to see much cleaning occurring or achieved on a fairly cleanish pair of retainers, with only a few areas of light build up.
I would question if this was greatly effective currently. Or at least effective enough to wow me into purchasing this from a store etc.
Honestly if ordered from Amazon, I would look at the paint inconsistency, try using the device, see that I haven’t noted a large cleaning impact, and initiate a return.

I think with some small improvements it could be a useful piece of kit.",3,1728001297.0,idyll,3,1.0,False

Pray for me.

But I have a question. After Divine Liturgy, almost everyone goes downstairs into the parish hall to share a meal together, they sit and talk. Its a very great experience. After coffee hour, some of us go back upstairs and sit in the pews for catechism class. 

The two months I have been attending there has been one guy who does not go downstairs. He remains in the Church area, but he goes up and stands in front of the icon of Jesus on the iconostasis. He uses a rope and does this bowing thing, and he does it the entire time between the end of Divine Liturgy until catechism class, which is roughly 1.5 hours. Last Sunday I realized he was crying while doing it. I felt a little ashamed to ask him what he was doing. He's a very nice guy, in fact he gave me so many books when I first started attending the parish and keeps telling me if I need anything to let him know, but he doesn't talk a lot and I'm too awkward to just start up a conversation to ask ""why are you doing all of that and crying? What is it for.""

1fvmfci,https://www.reddit.com/r/cryptids/comments/1fvmfci/strange_creepy_full_moon_dream/,Strange & Creepy Full Moon Dream,"About a year ago I had a terrible nightmare. Me and my family were being stalked and hunted by a werewolf. It was so vivid to the point it felt like it was real so as you can imagine I was extremely relieved when I awoke from it...but that relief wouldn't last long. 

Later that day I told my mom about the dream because she was in it with me. Both of us were being hunted by this werewolf. Well my mom got real creeped out when I told her about it and when I asked why she informed me that it was a full moon that night 🤨 it sent shivers down my spine and gave me goosebumps right when she told me and still does to this day when I think about it. 

Another odd thing is that I can still vividly remember this dream like it was yesterday which is not normal for me at all, I always forget my previous nights dreams by the time I've had my first cup of coffee if I even remember them at all. Yet I can pretty much play the entirety of the werewolf dream in my head like a movie to this day 🤔

I know in Slavic and Phillipino folklore, vampires can attack you in your dreams. The C.I.A. has even done experiments with dreaming and believe that our consciousness is transported to a different dimension/plane of existence while we dream. 

Any thoughts, insights, info, theories on what it could possibly mean would be greatly appreciated!! And what are the odds of having a dream of being hunted by a werewolf during a full moon?? It would be weird enough but understandable if I had known it was going to be a full moon that night, but I had no idea until my mom told me the next day!! ",0,1728001172.0,cryptids,0,0.25,False

I’m I overreacting?,"I (F29) recently gave my husband (M30) (3year relationship 15 years long distance friends) a gift. We were in a department store because I was trying to find a birthday gift for his father (also my boss). I wanted it to be a decent gift because his family is wealthy (to put it that way), and they’re used to fancy things (I’m not in the same social status). So my husband helped me pick out some nice clothes for his father, and then he saw a nice jacket that he fell in love with, so I decided to buy it for him as a gift.

It was the first time I could buy something for him because we had just moved from a place where I couldn’t legally work (yes, I said it, and you thought it), and I wasn’t able to have any income for two years. Now we’re back in our country, and we both work in his family’s company. I bought him a $150 jacket, which is kind of a lot for me but normal for him, and he appreciated it.

But yesterday, he left it in a school building and didn’t realize it until he got to the office (where I was). What he did was just tell his brother to call his “friend” (who was at the building but he wasn't really a friend) to look for it, and that was it. He wore the jacket on like two occasions, and he didn’t even try to go back to the school to find it.

Later, I found out that he left the jacket in a relatively safe place, not some random spot where it could easily get lost. He knew where it was but didn’t want to go back for it out of laziness. His family has like four brand new cars, he could just pick his favorite one and go back, and he just let it go that easily.

I don’t care about the cost; I care about the fact that he didn’t even try to get it back. If he did really lost the jacket It wasn’t a long trip, and it was important to me because I finally had the chance to give him something he loved.

He was only like, “I’m very sad” (with a normal face and continuing his tasks happily). When I expressed my feelings, he said, “Did you want me to drive back? 😤😠” and then added, “I’ll go get some coffee, do you want some? 😒”, and we went away of uncomfortable conversations as always.

# Spirit Airlines Explores Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) is running out of fuel—financially speaking. After a failed merger with JetBlue, the budget carrier is exploring bankruptcy options, discussing a potential restructuring under Chapter 11 with bondholders. It’s not looking good for the airline that's been trying to find some altitude amid mounting losses.

Spirit is scrambling to figure out what to do with its $3.3 billion debt, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds coming due soon. CEO Ted Christie has been in talks with bondholders, but let’s be honest—the options are running out. After the JetBlue merger fell apart in January, leaving Spirit in financial limbo, the airline lost the chance to join forces and create the fifth-largest carrier in the US. Now, instead of coasting on JetBlue’s coattails, Spirit is left battling steep losses and shrinking operations.

With bankruptcy potentially looming, Spirit’s balance sheet is far from stable. Its operational footprint has been shrinking—Spirit plans to slash capacity by nearly 20% in Q4, and it just furloughed 186 pilots. Not to mention, Spirit’s credit card processor has set an October 21 deadline to refinance or extend its notes.

**A Rocky Ride**  
Spirit hasn't posted an annual profit since before COVID, and even as travel has rebounded, the low-cost carrier hasn't found its footing. Major airlines are getting better at matching Spirit's budget fares, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines grounded part of its fleet, making things even tougher.

Routes have been cut, costs are being slashed, but the competition keeps ramping up. The debt clock is ticking, and without a merger to fall back on, Spirit is flying solo through some pretty stormy skies.

With fewer routes, mounting debt, and an increasingly competitive market, Spirit Airlines needs more than just luck to keep soaring.

# OpenAI Raises $6.6 Billion at $157 Billion Valuation

Call OpenAI the Silicon Valley darling—this AI powerhouse just scored $6.6 billion in fresh funding, catapulting its valuation to a staggering $157 billion.

# Spirit Airlines Explores Bankruptcy

Spirit Airlines ($SAVE) is running out of fuel—financially speaking. After a failed merger with JetBlue, the budget carrier is exploring bankruptcy options, discussing a potential restructuring under Chapter 11 with bondholders. It’s not looking good for the airline that's been trying to find some altitude amid mounting losses.

Spirit is scrambling to figure out what to do with its $3.3 billion debt, including $1.1 billion of secured bonds coming due soon. CEO Ted Christie has been in talks with bondholders, but let’s be honest—the options are running out. After the JetBlue merger fell apart in January, leaving Spirit in financial limbo, the airline lost the chance to join forces and create the fifth-largest carrier in the US. Now, instead of coasting on JetBlue’s coattails, Spirit is left battling steep losses and shrinking operations.

With bankruptcy potentially looming, Spirit’s balance sheet is far from stable. Its operational footprint has been shrinking—Spirit plans to slash capacity by nearly 20% in Q4, and it just furloughed 186 pilots. Not to mention, Spirit’s credit card processor has set an October 21 deadline to refinance or extend its notes.

**A Rocky Ride**  
Spirit hasn't posted an annual profit since before COVID, and even as travel has rebounded, the low-cost carrier hasn't found its footing. Major airlines are getting better at matching Spirit's budget fares, and the recall of Pratt & Whitney engines grounded part of its fleet, making things even tougher.

Routes have been cut, costs are being slashed, but the competition keeps ramping up. The debt clock is ticking, and without a merger to fall back on, Spirit is flying solo through some pretty stormy skies.

With fewer routes, mounting debt, and an increasingly competitive market, Spirit Airlines needs more than just luck to keep soaring.

1fvmbvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1fvmbvn/swipe_right_for_destiny/,Swipe Right for Destiny,"The café was a cozy, dimly lit refuge from the bustle of the city outside, its warm amber lights casting soft shadows over the rustic wooden tables. The air smelled of freshly ground coffee and faint vanilla, with the low hum of conversations blending into the soft background jazz.

Jordan sat at a corner table, her dark hair pulled back into a loose, practical ponytail, revealing sharp, focused brown eyes that darted between her phone and the woman seated across from her. She wore a black leather jacket over a simple gray T-shirt, giving her a casual yet commanding presence.

Across from her, Melanie leaned back in her chair, her platinum blonde hair falling in soft waves over her shoulders, her lips curled into an amused smile. Dressed in a sleek burgundy coat and jeans, Melanie radiated confidence, her bright blue eyes reflecting a mix of curiosity and skepticism. The contrast between the two was stark—Jordan, all intensity and purpose, while Melanie seemed to embody an effortless cool, her fingers idly tracing the edge of her coffee cup as she waited for whatever explanation Jordan was about to offer.

“So, you don’t believe in vaccines, huh?” Jordan asked casually, stirring her coffee.

Melanie leaned forward. “Let’s just say I’m... cautious. Who knows what they’re putting in people these days? Nanotech? Tracking devices?”

Jordan chuckled, but it wasn’t her usual charming laugh. This was the kind of laugh you made when you’re about to drop a bomb.

“Well,” she started, leaning back in her chair and taking a deep breath. “Now, if not taking the vaccine is your thing, and you think I have a microchip... you’re right. I do.”

Melanie raised an eyebrow, but Jordan pressed on before she could interrupt.

“I was sent here from the year 2250 to stop a catastrophic event. And yeah, they implanted a microchip in me. Standard procedure for time operatives.”

Melanie’s eyes widened, but her smile didn’t fade. She still thought this woman was joking. “Time traveler, huh? That's a new one.”

Jordan leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a whisper. “This isn’t a joke. A disaster is coming, something that will wipe out a third of the population in less than a year. And I’m here to prevent it. The key to stopping it? My target. Someone I was sent to find and eliminate before they trigger the chain of events. And that’s where you come in.”

“Me?” she asked, amusement creeping into her tone.

“Not *you* exactly,” Jordan corrected. “But Tinder.”

Melanie’s amused expression didn’t change. “Oh, so you swipe left to save the world, and swipe right for destiny?”

Jordan gave a tight smile. “Something like that. I know it sounds ridiculous, and believe me, it wasn’t my first choice,” Jordan admitted with a wry grin. “But it turns out, in 2024, this is the only reliable way to find the target. They’re somewhere on that app, swiping through profiles, completely unaware of the future they’ll set into motion.”

Melanie leaned back, eyeing her thoughtfully. ""You're serious.""

Jordan nodded. ""Dead serious.""

""Okay, assuming any of this is real, why tell me?""

Jordan sighed. ""Because... you're the only match I've gotten in two weeks, and I was starting to think I'd never find my target. I wasn’t sure if you might be the one, or maybe connected to them. But now I’m thinking... maybe you can help.""

Melanie studied her for a long moment, her skepticism slowly giving way to curiosity. “Help? How?”

Jordan pulled out her phone, swiping through the Tinder app. “Help me find the target. Swipe through profiles, cross-reference details, see if anything seems off. They’re out there, and I can’t do this alone.”

For the first time in their conversation, Melanie's playful expression disappeared, replaced by a quiet seriousness. The familiar world outside the window—cars passing, people strolling—suddenly felt remote, insignificant, as she realized she might be part of something bigger than herself—bigger than she could have ever imagined.

“So,” Melanie said, leaning forward as she unlocked her phone, her voice now tinged with an urgency she couldn’t hide. “Who exactly are we looking for?”

Jordan met her eyes, the intensity in her gaze sharp and unwavering. “A face that doesn’t belong in this timeline.”

 

Melanie swiped through her Tinder feed, her heart pounding harder with each profile. What had begun as a lighthearted conversation had shifted into something far more serious, and the woman across from her—despite the absurdity of her claims—was surprisingly convincing. There was a certainty in her demeanor, a calm confidence that didn’t match the usual ramblings of a conspiracy theorist. Jordan’s sharp eyes darted between her phone and Melanie’s, the tension between them thickening with each passing second.

“So, what exactly happens if we don’t find this person?” Melanie asked, her finger hovering over another profile, more out of nervous curiosity than genuine interest.

Jordan sighed deeply, the weight of her mission pressing visibly on her shoulders as she leaned back in her chair. She gazed out the café window for a moment, watching the city’s bright lights flicker in the distance, then turned her attention back to Melanie.

""It’s not just about finding them, Mel,"" Jordan began, her voice lower now, almost as if she didn’t want the world to hear. ""If we don't stop them, it’s the end—global collapse. And I’m not talking about a pandemic like the ones you’ve read about or lived through. This is something worse, something engineered. A pathogen that adapts, evolves. It doesn’t just kill people—it *changes* the biosphere, corrupts it at the molecular level.""

Melanie’s brow furrowed, and she pulled her hand back from her phone. “What do you mean, ‘changes the biosphere’? Are we talking zombies or...?”

Jordan shook her head, a grim smile flickering at the edges of her lips. “No, no zombies. It’s not that kind of horror. The pathogen doesn’t just stop at human hosts. It spreads through animals, plants—anything biological. It warps ecosystems, turns rainforests into toxic wastelands, oceans into dead zones. Every living thing begins to break down, mutate. The air becomes poisonous, the water undrinkable, and within a decade, Earth is uninhabitable for humans. No escape. No refuge. Only chaos.”

Melanie felt a cold shiver crawl up her spine, the weight of what Jordan was saying settling like a stone in her chest. “But... how does it start? Who would even *want* to do something like that?”

Jordan’s gaze hardened. “That’s the thing—it's not about someone wanting it to happen. The person we’re looking for isn’t a villain in the traditional sense. They don’t know what they’re going to do. They’re just someone... ordinary. One decision, one small act, sets everything in motion. Maybe it’s signing the wrong contract, funding the wrong project, pressing the wrong button. Maybe it’s as simple as being in the wrong place at the wrong time. They don’t even know the disaster they’ll unleash. But that decision cascades, triggering the release of the pathogen.”

She leaned forward, her voice intense, pleading for Melanie to understand. “And that’s why I’m here. That’s why I was sent. The technology we use in the future—it can predict quantum signatures, map out the ripple effects of certain decisions. But even with all that, we don’t know who the target is yet. Their future is obscured. Someone or something is trying to mask them from me. It’s like trying to see through fog. The only thing we know for sure is that they’re on this app. Tinder. A random swipe could lead to the end of the world.”

Melanie’s fingers clenched around her phone, her skepticism slowly crumbling under the weight of Jordan’s urgency. “So... this person. They’re just out there, living their life, totally unaware?”

Jordan nodded grimly. “That’s right. They’re not evil, Mel. They don’t want to destroy the world. But that’s what makes it harder. They’re just like you and me—ordinary, flawed, unaware. They don’t know that what they’re about to do will bring about the collapse of civilization.”

Melanie swallowed hard. This all sounded like some sci-fi movie, but the look in Jordan's eyes was deadly serious. She'd never been one to buy into wild stories, but she had to admit—the way she spoke, the details she gave, it all seemed... real. And something inside her wanted to believe her.

""So,"" Melanie said, swiping through yet another profile. ""What do we do when we find them? How do we stop them?""

Jordan’s face tightened, and she paused before answering. ""They have to be eliminated. Before they can act.""

The weight of the word ""eliminate"" hung between them like a heavy fog. Melanie stared at her, trying to gauge her expression. There was no malice in her voice, but it was clear she wasn't joking.

""You mean... kill them?""

Jordan nodded solemnly. ""I won’t lie. This is a dark mission. But the fate of billions hangs in the balance. Once we find them, I’ll handle the rest.""

Melanie looked back down at her phone, her mind racing. Could she really help this woman find someone and… and be okay with what happened next? She had always been someone who valued life, who believed in finding peaceful solutions. But this was something else. This was survival on a global scale.

She swiped past a few more profiles, then paused on one. A man, probably in his mid-thirties, dark hair, green eyes, a smile that didn’t quite reach his eyes.

Jordan noticed her hesitation. ""Something about him?""

""I don’t know,"" Melanie said slowly. ""It's just... something feels off. His profile seems normal, but..."" She trailed off, unsure how to explain the sense of wrongness she felt.

Jordan leaned over, looking at the screen. ""Let me see.""

Melanie handed her the phone. Jordan scrutinized the man’s picture, her eyes narrowing. ""That’s him.""

Melanie’s stomach dropped. ""What? How do you know?""

Jordan didn’t take her eyes off the screen. ""I can feel it. There’s a subtle disruption in his profile. It’s like... an echo from the future. This is him.""

Melanie felt a surge of adrenaline. ""What now?""

Jordan’s expression hardened. ""Now, I match with him. I’ll arrange a meeting, and we’ll finish this.""

Without another word, Jordan swiped right. Almost instantly, the notification popped up: **It’s a match!**

“Whoa,” Melanie said, eyes wide. “That was fast.”

Jordan stood, her entire demeanor shifting from the casual café-goer to something far more intense. “They’ve been waiting for me.”

Melanie felt a jolt of alarm. “Wait, what do you mean? It’s a trap?”

Jordan stood up, grabbing her coat and heading for the door. “They know someone’s coming. They don’t know it’s me, but they’re prepared.”

Panic surged through Melanie as she hurried to her feet, following Jordan. ""Wait, what am I supposed to do?""

Jordan stopped and turned to face Melanie; her face softer now. ""You’ve done more than I could’ve hoped. I need you to stay safe. If anything happens to me, the timeline could unravel. Whatever you do, don’t interfere.""

""But—"" Melanie started, but Jordan was already gone, slipping out the door and into the night, her figure disappearing into the shadows.

Melanie stood there, frozen in place, her mind spinning. The whole thing felt like a fever dream. But before she could process what had just happened, her phone buzzed in her hand—another Tinder notification. She glanced down at the screen. The same man Jordan had swiped on had messaged her.

**“I’ve been waiting for you, too.”**

Me and my family were being stalked and hunted by a werewolf. It was so vivid to the point it felt like it was real so as you can imagine I was extremely relieved when I awoke from it...but that relief wouldn't last long. 

Later that day I told my mom about the dream because she was in it with me. Both of us were being hunted by this werewolf. Well my mom got real creeped out when I told her about it and when I asked why she informed me that it was a full moon that night 🤨 it sent shivers down my spine and gave me goosebumps right when she told me and still does to this day when I think about it. 

Another odd thing is that I can still vividly remember this dream like it was yesterday which is not normal for me at all, I always forget my previous nights dreams by the time I've had my first cup of coffee if I even remember them at all. Yet I can pretty much play the entirety of the werewolf dream in my head like a movie to this day 🤔

Any insights, info, theories on what it could possibly mean would be greatly appreciated!! And what are the odds of having a dream of being hunted by a werewolf during a full moon??

","I am currently considering going to school to become an occupational therapy assistant but I’m feeling really nervous. I used to work as a CNA and absolutely loved what I did. I then went to nursing school before dropping out because of my declining mental health. I have gone to a lot of therapy since then and am in a better place as far as depression goes but my anxiety has been pretty bad the past couple years. 

I work at a coffee shop now and can be a bit quiet and anxious with all the new people around everyday. But, I think part of the reason I stay that way is because it’s not something I care about. When I worked as a CNA or even a nanny that anxiety faded away over time because I loved and believed in what I was doing. I feel like those times in my life were the happiest and most myself I’ve ever felt in a job. I plan to keep taking medication and going to therapy to manage my anxiety..  

I think part of the thing that scares me is having so much responsibility and needing to talk with confidence. I’m always second guessing myself and making myself shrink/ feel small. It feels like I can’t take myself seriously. I have this idea that I’m not put together enough to be able to help with other people like that… especially since OT sometimes helps with social skills. I want to believe I can do more than I’m telling myself but I’m scared. I have a deep respect for myself and all I’ve been through but my self esteem is low. I think I have Autism and ADHD and I’m thinking I may get tested soon. I’m wondering if maybe knowing that about myself and then going to therapy with the full picture could help me understand myself better and gain some confidence. 

Anyone have a similar experience? Would you recommend healthcare? Anyone specifically work in OT? I’m struggling to figure out what I want to do because I feel like I need to feel passionate/ care deeply about it so I’ll be motivated to keep doing it.  I’ve also noticed that in the past, the more social I would get, the less scared I would become over time. I’ve just been stuck in this phase of bad social anxiety for a couple years now and have this fear I will always be this way. ",1,1728000777.0,AutismInWomen,0,1.0,False

1fvm964,https://www.reddit.com/r/wyldeflowers/comments/1fvm964/wyldeflowers_2dlc_concept/,Wyldeflowers 2/DLC (concept),"I have an idea for Wyldeflowers 2!!

You play the game as Jesse, a fully customizable character (hair, appearance, a few accessories like glasses or earrings or something, pronouns, etc.) 

The game starts in Jesse's room in Milk water, there are flashes of a nightmare that dipictes the magic of Ravenwood Hollow & Fairhaven. They wake startled from their dreams. cut to Jesse in an occult bookstore (either Juliette or Sebastian, or both works there!) in search of more information about Ravenwood Hollow and it's magic. The scene ends with Jesse realizing they are a ""Wyldeling"" as Ariel mentions in the game and learning about their Aunt/Cousin/Whatever, Tara from the booksellers.

Then much like Wyldeflowers, Jesse arrives in Fairhaven and stays with Tara on the farm to learn more about their heritage.

I see this taking place where our current beloved characters are older (except for Shelby!) and now we're playing Jesse as a Tara aged character. Juliette and Sebastian are grown/your age... Emi and Fin are older.

There are new romancable characters and as Jesse, you can date them all at the same time until deciding who to marry, if you marry anyone at all.

The overall concept is witchy discovery, dating drama, found family.  Which makes you decide you want to stay in Fairhaven and open a bookstore/coffee shop and find your own place (if Tara is married you rent out her partners old place!) to live.

Eventually you discover a portal to Ravenwood Hollow in your bookshop so you can travel there and meet the fae. Peri and Ariel look the same, Westley a silver fox! Lol

As for resource management - I'm thinking you help out on the farm some since Auntie Tara is older but you're also:

- buying trade from Kai for the cafe part of your bookstore so you can craft coffees, etc for the townfolk. 
- buying making wearable gifts for your dates (creating some drama!! Lol)
- going on new gloaming adventures 
- finding special books for the townfolk who shop in your bookstore 
- did I mention going on dates and drama! Haha.
- still making clothes with Violets patterns

https://preview.redd.it/kmpv112enmsd1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=989cc077ac318246a61f052e41212d97ee403d67

Let's face it, the image of the freelancer working from a quaint coffee shop, laptop open, and latte in hand is a bit cliché, isn't it? While the allure of working from anywhere is undeniable, the reality can be quite different. Distractions abound, Wi-Fi can be unreliable, and let's not even talk about the awkward scramble for a power outlet. Enter co-working spaces – a game-changer for freelancers seeking productivity, community, and a touch of professionalism.  

As someone who has navigated the freelance world for years, I've experienced the rollercoaster of working from home, cafes, and even park benches (desperate times!). But it wasn't until I discovered co-working spaces that I truly unlocked my productivity and overall work satisfaction. These vibrant hubs offer a unique blend of resources, networking opportunities, and a sense of community that can be a lifeline for the independent worker.  

# The Power of Place: How Co-Working Spaces Fuel Productivity

One of the biggest challenges freelancers face is creating a clear separation between work and personal life. When your home is your office, it's easy to get sidetracked by household chores, Netflix binges, or that ever-growing pile of laundry. Co-working spaces provide a dedicated environment designed for work, allowing you to focus and get things done. Think ergonomic chairs, high-speed internet, and printers that actually work – all without the distractions of your home environment.  

# Beyond the Desk: Networking and Collaboration in Co-Working Spaces

Co-working spaces are more than just fancy desks and strong coffee. They're vibrant communities of like-minded individuals from diverse backgrounds and industries. This creates fertile ground for networking, collaboration, and even friendships. Imagine bumping into a web developer while grabbing a coffee, or brainstorming ideas with a marketing guru over lunch. These serendipitous encounters can lead to new clients, partnerships, and a sense of camaraderie that can be invaluable for freelancers who often work solo.  

# More Than a Workspace: The Perks of Co-Working

Co-working spaces often go above and beyond to provide members with a range of benefits that enhance both their work and personal lives. From workshops and networking events to yoga classes and happy hours, there's always something happening to keep you engaged and connected. Many spaces also offer access to meeting rooms, podcasting studios, and other resources that can be a major boon for freelancers.  

# Finding Your Tribe: Choosing the Right Co-Working Space

With the rise of remote work, co-working spaces have popped up in cities and towns across the globe. Each space has its own unique vibe and caters to different needs and preferences. Some are geared towards tech startups, while others attract creative professionals or entrepreneurs. When choosing a co-working space, consider factors like location, community, amenities, and cost to find the perfect fit for your work style and personality.  

# Co-Working: A Catalyst for Freelance Success

In the ever-evolving world of freelancing, co-working spaces offer a compelling solution to the challenges of isolation, distraction, and lack of resources. By providing a dedicated workspace, fostering a sense of community, and offering a wealth of perks, these dynamic hubs empower freelancers to thrive both personally and professionally. So ditch the coffee shop and embrace the power of co-working – your freelance career will thank you for it.

1fvlzlh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Persona5/comments/1fvlzlh/are_there_any_tasteful_balance_mods_for_p5r/,Are there any tasteful balance mods for P5R?,"Hello everyone? Recently I started craving for new P5R playthrough, but this time I wanted to spice things up with modded playthrough that increases the game's difficulty. I'm not that well versed in P5R modding scene, all difficulty modes that I see are complete overhauls type of mods. 

They add hundreds of new personas, hundreds of new skills and heavily ramp up the difficulty drastically to accommodate new tools at your disposal. I don't enjoy those kind of mods, I think the best approach is tune down what we already have, with having HARD difficulty as the baseline.What am I looking for exactly:

1. Mod that heavily nerfs the money acquired in the latter half of the game. I think this is a most prominent balance problem in the game: with how versatile items are and how powerful C&J Special Treatment you can really bust loose from Okumura's Palace onward. The general levels of income + confidant abilities that give you bonus cash need to be nerfed, so if you need to acquire large sum of money you HAVE to spend couple of days grinding in mementos;

2. Mods that nerf the amount/availability of the items in the game. That's my second biggest complaint — items can be used by ANY member and can provide ANY type of effect or damage (with the exception of select Personas signature skills and third awakening skills). So any member can be a healer/buffer/damage dealer of the specific type to exploit weakness and baton pass. I don't think any items should be removed from the game, but chances to get any of them as a drop should be lowered, and the amount of medicine you can buy should be limited (for example, per week, like from vending machines), with maybe even slight price increases. 

With that change, I think it will require the player to fuse and carry personas mindfully, with understanding that you can't brute force any encounter with items. There is actually a store in Kichijoji that will buy your sooty armor and in exchange can sell you Dekunda/Dekaja items, but they're truly limited and once you buy the whole stock they won't respawn. That is a great design choice in my opinion.

On my first P5R playthrough I struggled against Madarame for couple of attempts, until I reloaded to the day prior and crafted couple of elemental damage items for his second phase. That helped greatly, and felt great too. But after that I stockpiled so much of them that even infamous Okumura Fight had nothing on me.

3. It could probably go under second point, but SP recovery should be somewhat nerfed too. With will seeds, cooked coffee and curry, baton pass buffs and some confidant abilities there should be enough room to clear all Palaces in the least amount of time if you don't throw skills around willy-nilly. Such accessories as SP adhesives should be removed completely.

4. Ryuji's Instakill. Just remove it from the game, there shouldn't be ANY ability that could allow you to grind ad infinitum, without having you spend a single point of resource ('cept the IRL time), even if it was 1 Yen / 1 Exp at a time.

5. That is the most straightforward and blunt change — bump required levels of Palace minions and bosses across the board. Just 1-3 levels should be fine, as Ann said, to give some oomph to it.

  
You could say that some of these changes can be self-imposed for a challenge run, e.g no items/no revives/no confidant run. But that would not sit right with me. As a humans, it's in our nature to always seek more ways to benefit ourself, and exploit the system for maximum gain. I would feel much better if I knew that I simply can't do the stuff the same way as on the regular playthrough and work from that standpoint.

  
I actually already used balancing mod in the past: [https://gamebanana.com/mods/408890](https://gamebanana.com/mods/408890) Full DLC Rework by MeovvCat. 

I just looked for a way to take DLC outfits without taking money/accessories/free DLC personas, but in addition to that it heavily nerfed DLC personas signature skills, to be far less overpowered. It allowed me to fuse and use them, without feeling guilty for steamrolling the game with Neo-Cadenza or Myriad Truths. That's a win-win for me,

  
So that was my take on game balancing, and I wonder if someone reached the same conclusions as I did and found the necessary mods to make it work. Thanks for reading! ",1,1727999882.0,Persona5,0,1.0,False

Just wondering what the benefits are with a Coffee Supreme subscription vs buying the same beans from the supermarket? 

Cost of the subscription + free shipping is about $15 compared to buying from the likes of Woolworths which is $9.79 member price.

This was a no brainier so I happily pulled the trigger. I received the package and was excited to set it up. After unboxing the machine and putting it on my counter, I noticed that there were only 5 options instead of the 7 that the picture on Amazon showed; no coffee or iced coffee options. I immediately checked the model number and it was ECAM29063SB, different than what I had ordered.

I started to do some research and found out that there are two variants of the Magnifica Evo. ECAM29084SB is the full-featured model while ECAM29063SB lacks the two coffee options and is sold mainly at Costco these days for cheaper. So I came up with two possible scenarios why this happened. 1) they used to sell ECAM29063SB at some point and had some old stock left over which an Amazon employee accidentally sent me instead without checking the model number, or 2) some clown bought the Costco model for cheaper and then one from Amazon, kept the full-featured one and returned the Costco version for a refund. Amazon mostly likely happily took it back and restocked it.

I called Amazon customer service, explained the situation but was told that these machines were non-returnable or exchangeable due to some dumb wattage regulation. I then asked for another option for resolution to which the Amazon rep said, ""Just call DeLonghi and they'll take care of you."" I debated on canceling my Prime membership right there and then but held off, hung up, and called DeLonghi customer care. The rep on the phone was patient and listened to my situation to which he then replied, ""yeah we've unfortunately heard this before with Amazon, they just don't care about inventory control."" The rep told me to send him pictures of the machine, box, and the Amazon listing and invoice and they would take care of me and swap it out for the right model.

So thankful that some manufacturers still take of the customer because Amazon has shown they just don't care about correcting a mistake on their end.",9,1727999509.0,superautomatic,5,1.0,False

I'm in the north, where even wearing a hijab is a great sin—you have to be fully covered! I'm 28, and I can’t even go sit outside my door. I can’t open the windows in my room upstairs because if there's a man outside, he would see me. I hate going outside to the mall or a coffee shop. It's just men wearing the trendiest outfits, and then there’s us—a black ocean around them. 

I can’t bring it up because I don’t want to ruin the mood, or I would get a reply that we can have it in heaven (I don’t believe in it). It got worse when I visited the capital, and one day, my sister and I tried not to wear hijab or niqab (with abaya underneath, of course). I felt alive for the first time. I was complimented a lot. I never knew I was pretty until this point. We literally didn’t do anything—just let our hair breathe for half a day.

I hate that at my age, a 7-year-old in another country has more experience than me. I don’t want my life to be empty; I want to try to live, but I can’t. Also, most of my friends and cousins my age are okay with arranged marriages, and I’m not. None of them are happy—they’re just servants. I don’t want to live like that. I can’t even get to know someone because I know for sure that if these men found out their sister was talking to a man, they would kill her or lock her up.

Even if I found someone different, the possibility of us breaking up on bad terms is scary because men here have the power to ruin your whole life. Just if someone knew I was talking to someone, everyone in my family would be affected by this scandal—that's how they keep women caged in.

Lots and lots of trauma dumping.

I've been struggling with poverty while most of my cousins had wealthy or a secure upbringing, including having both parents under the roof while my father was barely there until he left altogether. I am also a product of >! marital rape !< . I've always been fat and ugly - resembling my father instead of my gorgeous mother, my cousins were all skinny and gained weight after getting married/into relationships, so they don't have the same experience with eating disorders and poor self image as I do. They may be fat now, but I truly doubt they regret their animosity towards my looks. My cousins always told me that I tried too hard to be funny while I've made many, many guy friends because of it. I try not to pride myself too much in it but having someone pee themselves twice over a joke really made me happy in a weird way.

I always felt a little estranged from my grandmother because I'm pretty sure she hates my mother (middle child of eleven) whom she singled out as opposed to her ten other children and forced her to drop out of school at age 11. Now I've got this image of a geek in my family, studious, smart and obedient. My mother only cares about my education since she didn't receive one while I wanted to learn a trade instead. Now I'm a burnt out STEM major and might be dropping out of college after wasting thousands, plus six years of my life due to untreated mental illness.

My cousins also complained a lot about my aunts and uncles congratulating me on receiving better grades. I've even been told that my absence due to studying 24/7 (I was the first to graduate from high school) estranged me from my cousins a few years ago. I cried so much because if I don't hit the books, I won't have a father to pay my bills, driver's ed lessons and now I don't have cousins to hang out with. I've always been busy, I had my first job at 14 cleaning shelves at an office. I'd spent multiple summer breaks there while my cousins were on vacation. I even volunteered for a few years.

One time I mentioned that I was sexually harassed and I received doubt because who'd even assume somebody would want to touch me. I also don't have a lot of female friends. I adore my male friends, I truly do but sometimes I wish I could have a group of women to confide in and fit in. I heard about women's bodies producing oxytocin during girls hangouts and I haven't been the same since I've heard about it. Are my male friends not enough? Do I really need women like that? I even have lots of feminine gay friends, maybe that's okay, too.

Something that I really hate is that even my cousins ask me to take pictures of them together without me. My middle school to high school best friend even refused to follow me on Instagram due to my association meanwhile he hit me up after I went a little ""viral"" with some videos. I haven't been the same since. Even friends require me be beautiful. 

Regardless, everybody is living rent-free, married wealthy or had a trust fund and I asked for luck. Just one thing I don't have to work for or stress over and then I met him.

At first I had a crush on this tech support guy I met on campus who helped me recover some data. He was handsome, funny and exuded charisma. I couldn't stop thinking about him but then found out he stopped working at the tech support and I got a little sad but now it gets weird. I actually happened to be sitting next to his brother during a lecture. Now he is calm, not as brazen and playful but so caring and gentle. He's also an athlete which I admire. He made me write my phone number on his arm and I really felt like I was in a 90s coming of age movie. Guys and gals don't do that anymore. I'm a texter, not a hanging out type of person but no, he immediately invited me over for a coffee (I didn't want to eat in front of him due to my diet) and we've immediately clicked. There was no trauma bonding, no lovebombing, no negging, just a normal man confiding in me, wanting to hit the gym with me and talk to me about rock music, foreign cultures, health and values. He also has the most beautiful smile and I love that I can make him laugh. He makes me blush and he even took my first holding hands.

I forgot about his brother and I feel like I got so much more than I asked for but obviously I need to sabotage myself and turn him down after he tried so often to see me again. He's an honest and thoughtful man, so I assumed he'd meet me in person to break it off but instead we met up and he told me that he chooses to believe in me. We started meeting again and nobody in my vicinity knows about him or how happy he makes me.

No friends, not even online, I don't even talk about him anonymously - this is my first time. Nobody will know about him and if anything turns serious, I'll save my peace and be happy publicly.",1,1727999321.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

# My Ranking of Transparent Labs Protein Flavors

Here’s a breakdown of the top flavors from Transparent Labs, ranked from best to worst. 

Spoiler: Some of these might surprise you!

**Disclosure:** This article contains affiliate links. If you purchase through these links, we may earn a commission at no extra cost to you.

# 1. Dark Chocolate

* **Rating: 10/10**
* **Why It’s the Best:** Rich, indulgent, and perfect for dark chocolate lovers. It mixes smoothly in water or milk and shines when used in smoothies or baking.

# 2. French Vanilla

* **Rating: 9/10**
* **Why You’ll Love It:** Classic and versatile, this flavor mixes well with anything—water, milk, smoothies, or even oats. It’s smooth and sweet without being overpowering.

# 3. Mint Chocolate Chip

* **Rating: 8.5/10**
* **Why It’s Unique:** A refreshing twist on a classic. The mint flavor is just right and doesn’t overpower the chocolate. It’s perfect for anyone wanting something different from the usual chocolate or vanilla.

# 4. Strawberry Milkshake

* **Rating: 8/10**
* **Why It Stands Out:** The flavor is sweet and fruity, giving you that milkshake-like experience. However, it might be a little too sweet for some, especially when mixed with just water.

# 5. Chocolate Peanut Butter

* **Rating: 7.5/10**
* **Where It Falls Short:** While it excels in milk and smoothies, this one has a slight aftertaste when mixed with water. Best reserved for more flavorful blends like smoothies or shakes.

# 6. Mocha Latte

* **Rating: 7/10**
* **Why It’s for Coffee Lovers:** This one’s perfect for anyone who loves a strong coffee taste. It pairs well with almond milk, but the flavor can be a bit too intense when mixed with water alone.

# 7. Cinnamon French toast

* **Rating: 5/10**
* **Why You Should Be Cautious:** The overwhelming sweetness makes this flavor tough to drink, especially if you’re not a fan of syrup-heavy tastes. It’s decent in milk but not great in water.

# What You Should Know Before You Buy

Transparent Labs offers clean ingredients, and their grass-fed whey is sourced from hormone-free cows. No artificial sweeteners, fillers, or preservatives are used, making it a great option for anyone serious about clean nutrition.

But not all flavors are created equal. While Dark Chocolate and French Vanilla consistently deliver, flavors like Cinnamon French Toast can be too sweet for most people. If you're experimenting with flavors, stick to those highly rated ones unless you know your preferences lean toward sweeter options.

# The Best for Your Goals

Whether you’re bulking up, looking for a meal replacement, or need a versatile protein for post-workout recovery, choosing the right flavor matters. Here’s what I recommend based on your needs:

* **For Smoothies:** Dark Chocolate and Mint Chocolate Chip are excellent for blending into smoothies.
* **For Baking:** French Vanilla and Dark Chocolate work wonders in recipes.
* **For Shakes:** Mocha Latte and Chocolate Peanut Butter are great in milk-based shakes.

# Conclusion: Which Should You Pick?

If you’re investing in Transparent Labs protein, I’d recommend starting with Dark Chocolate or French Vanilla. They’re versatile, reliable, and will give you the most bang for your buck.

about three weeks ago I decided to start eating healthier in an effort to start losing weight again

(about 8 years ago I lost approximately 120 pounds through boxing and exercise, but since I didn't solve my problems with food I eventually gained it all back \[and likely then some\] when I stopped about 5 years ago)

I can't do any high intensity exercise like boxing due to an abdominal injury, so this time I'm trying to get my diet in line. My overall goal is health, but it'd also be nice to look a bit better than I do and feel more confident, even just for my own sake. 

I've been trying to figure out how many calories someone my size burns to develop some kind of baseline, but I feel like the numbers I'm getting from calculators are wrong and it's due to my high starting weight. 

When i put my info into a calorie calculator, I get told I can eat something like 3900 calories and maintain my weight. That just seems stupid high, no?

I've been fluctuating between 1500 and 1800 calories a day for the last two weeks and I  had one cheat day where I went up to 2500 calories and treated myself to some non-diet friendly (but still not ridiculous) foods (I ate a bagel and a donut). I definitely feel hungry and know I'm eating less than before, but it just seems unlikely that the deficit is THAT significant. 

I eat very little bread/simple carbs (one english muffin a day and up to two tortillas a couple times a week when I make wraps for dinner/lunch), no dairy or cheese, as few processed foods as possible, no UPF products, and my only sugar is in my morning coffee and my evening hot chocolate (my one daily treat). 

Should I be eating more to prevent myself from shocking my system of like, keeling over, or am I just being dramatic and I'm doing fine/should be cutting out more?

I work in account management and have been with my company for 5 years. I'm treated very well, any salary request I've made at my annuals have been granted, glowing feedback etc. Really, it's been swell. 

In January I approached my boss about wanting to move into a managerial role and asked if we could have an informal meeting/coffee date so I could pick her brain about qualifications and what she looks for in management. At this point, she's the manager of my department and has an assistant manager. She counters with a formal meeting, which we have where she says that she wants me for a position that they'll build for me. She'll start working on it right away. 

Long story short, she put the cart before the horse. Promised me the position several times, then said I'd have to ""interview"" and then I would have it. I'm going through the (very lengthy) interview process now. Had the interview last week, boss called me after to tell me I nailed it, and I've just been told I have a second interview next week, which means they definitely have other candidates that they are considering. 

Basically, my job is sweet but not getting this position sours the place for me if I don't get it, especially after literally being promised it by management. How would I trust her again? I know i need to articulate during this interview that I don't know if I'd be able to stay on there if I don't get the job. Or do I need to?

# The Truth About Transparent Labs Protein

When it comes to protein powders, flavor is just as important as nutritional value. After all, nobody wants to choke down a chalky, bland shake post-workout. Transparent Labs promises clean, natural ingredients, but how do their flavors really hold up?

I’ve tried all of their bestsellers, and here’s what I found—some flavors are absolute winners, while others, well, you might want to avoid.

# My Ranking of Transparent Labs Protein Flavors

Here’s my ranking of the most popular Transparent Labs protein flavors, from best to worst:

1. **Dark Chocolate**
   * **Overall Rating: 10/10**
   * Rich and indulgent. Perfect for dark chocolate lovers. It mixes well and works great in smoothies or baked goods.
2. **French Vanilla**
   * **Overall Rating: 9/10**
   * Sweet, creamy, and versatile. It’s a solid choice if you want something that mixes well with everything from water to almond milk.
3. **Mint Chocolate Chip**
   * **Overall Rating: 8.5/10**
   * Refreshing yet balanced. The mint flavor isn’t overwhelming and adds a nice twist to the usual chocolate routine.
4. **Strawberry Milkshake**
   * **Overall Rating: 8/10**
   * If you’re a fan of fruity shakes, this one’s for you. However, the flavor might be too sweet for some.
5. **Chocolate Peanut Butter**
   * **Overall Rating: 7.5/10**
   * Great in milk but has a strange aftertaste in water. Ideal for smoothies or as an oatmeal add-in.
6. **Mocha Latte**
   * **Overall Rating: 7/10**
   * Perfect for coffee lovers. The flavor is strong and works well in morning shakes, but it’s not the best with plain water.
7. **Milk Chocolate**
   * **Overall Rating: 6.5/10**
   * A classic, but the flavor is a bit weak compared to other brands.
8. **Cinnamon French Toast**
   * **Overall Rating: 5/10**
   * Way too sweet and syrupy. It’s tolerable in milk but overwhelming in water.

# Are Transparent Labs' Flavors Overhyped?

After testing all these flavors, here’s my take: 

While some flavors are excellent, others fall short. Dark Chocolate and French Vanilla stand out as reliable options, but others, like Cinnamon French Toast, are a disappointment unless you have a very specific taste preference.

If you're considering Transparent Labs, I’d recommend sticking with the safe bets, like Dark Chocolate and French Vanilla. And if you’re feeling adventurous, try the Mint Chocolate Chip.

# Why Transparent Labs Still Stands Out

Despite some of the hit-or-miss flavors, there’s one undeniable fact: Transparent Labs is one of the cleanest and most transparent protein brands on the market. 

Their commitment to using grass-fed, hormone-free cows for their whey protein is a huge plus.

Their proteins are also free from artificial sweeteners, food dyes, gluten, and unnecessary fillers, which means you’re getting a product that aligns with clean eating.

# My Recommendation

If you’re looking for a high-quality protein with mostly solid flavors, Transparent Labs is a great option. But before you make your purchase, consider my rankings to ensure you get the best experience possible.

Transparent Labs offers a variety of flavors, and I’ve personally tested each one to give you the best rundown of what to expect from their protein line.

# Why Transparent Labs Stands Out

[Transparent Labs' protein powders](https://transparentlabs.sjv.io/753eKg) are made with natural ingredients and free of artificial sweeteners, which is a huge plus for those of us focused on clean eating. With **28g of protein per serving** and **minimal carbs and fats**, it’s one of the leanest, most effective options out there.

Plus, with a variety of flavors to choose from, they offer something for everyone. 

Here’s my honest take on each flavor, and how they stack up.

[Watch the full ranking video here.](https://youtu.be/HGvKpqN4Rt4)

# My Testing Methodology

I made sure to test each flavor in several ways:

1. **Water Test:** Basic shake with water to get the pure taste.
2. **Milk Test:** To see how it holds up in a creamier base.
3. **Smoothie Test:** Blended with fruits and other ingredients to test mixability.
4. **Baking Test:** For those who like to bake with their protein.

# Flavor Rankings

1. **Dark Chocolate – 10/10** A rich, indulgent flavor that hits all the right notes, whether in water or milk. It's versatile and tastes great in smoothies and even baked goods.
2. **French Vanilla – 8.5/10** Smooth and classic, this one is perfect for mixing with fruits or oats. It’s a great choice for people who prefer a more subtle flavor profile.
3. **Strawberry Milkshake – 8.3/10** A fresh, fruity option that works surprisingly well in both shakes and baking. The flavor is strong but not overpowering.
4. **Milk Chocolate – 8.5/10** This is your classic chocolate flavor, perfect for those who want something familiar and reliable. It’s excellent in milk and holds up well in smoothies.
5. **Chocolate Peanut Butter – 7.5/10** While the flavor is good, it has an odd aftertaste in water. However, it shines in milk and smoothies, where the richness of the peanut butter comes through.
6. **Mocha Latte – 7/10** If you’re a coffee lover, you’ll enjoy this one. It’s great in milk but a bit too strong when mixed with water alone.
7. **Mint Chocolate Chip – 8/10** This one is a bit polarizing. If you like mint-flavored treats, you’ll enjoy this in both shakes and baked goods.
8. **Blueberry Pancakes – 7.5/10** This flavor is more for those who enjoy fruity protein powders. It works well in smoothies but can be a bit too sweet on its own.
9. **Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookie – 5/10** Unfortunately, this one falls flat. It’s not as flavorful as the others and has a strange aftertaste, especially in water.
10. **Cinnamon French Toast – 5/10** Overly sweet and not very versatile. The cinnamon flavor can be overpowering, and it doesn’t blend well with other ingredients.

# Honorable Mentions

**Peanut Butter (Discontinued)** – This was one of the best flavors they had, and if they bring it back, I highly recommend trying it!

# Beyond Protein: Transparent Labs' Other Products

Transparent Labs doesn’t just stop at protein powders. 

Their pre-workouts and recovery supplements also offer clean, high-quality ingredients. 

Whether you’re looking for a fat burner or a muscle builder, their product line provides a full spectrum of fitness support.

# Conclusion: Is Transparent Labs Protein Worth It?

Absolutely. 

Transparent Labs excels in offering great-tasting, clean protein powders that fit a variety of tastes. 

While some flavors are stronger than others, you’re bound to find one that fits your routine. 

Personally, **Dark Chocolate** and **French Vanilla** are my top recommendations, but there’s something here for everyone.

1fvlhlu,https://www.reddit.com/r/FODMAPS/comments/1fvlhlu/hi_new_here_and_a_bit_confused/,"Hi, new here and a bit confused","I was diagnosed last week as ""probably IBS"" and my PCP has ""recommended"" a FODMAP diet. A bit about me and relevant info on how I got here:

58yo male, type 2 diabetes and a cardiac issue brought on by low levels of potassium and magnesium. I have a history of lactose intolerance that I thought I had well managed by portion size. These are relevant due to how they influenced my diet and medications to date.

Cardiac: While searching in vain for an OTC potassium supplement, I attempted to increase my potassium intake with things like bananas and potatoes, the latter in the form of potato chips as a snack at work. Flavored chips like cheddar/sour cream and sour cream/onion. And some nuts including cashews, among others. Also, caffeine is a factor and I had to give up coffee. Too hard to find a decent whole-bean decaf so I just gave it up completely.

Diabetes: Well controlled with a combo of Synjardy and Trulicity.  Then Trulicity became scarce and my endocrinologist moved me to Ozempic, and shortly after that the problems started. I thought it was the new medication and stopped taking it after a month. Waited \~6 weeks for the symptoms to subside before my endo put me back on, at a much reduced dose and the symptoms came back. Stopped taking it again and this time the symptoms did not go away. So I made an appointment with my PCP.

While waiting for the appointment, I noticed that there was a difference between the frequency and severity of the symptoms depending on if I was off/at home or working in the office which led me to look at what's different and it came down to what I was eating during the day. PCP listened to all of that, and to my gut, and said ""Probably IBS, and probably had it for some time and the Ozempic only kicked it up"" (story of my life with DISH and thyroid tumor both found as a result of something else).

So here I am. He ""recommended"" a low FODMAP diet and this leads to my confusion.

I started looking into what is and isn't low FODMAP and I'm getting conflicting info. Some says hard cheeses are ok but soft isn't. Some say it's aged vs fresh/young with no regard to the texture, and on top of that some cheeses that are ""young/fresh"" are listed as OK but others aren't. Some places say tea is bad (with no distinction on what type of tea) and others make a distinction, and just before this diagnosis I bought a three month supply of loose-leaf Oolong because it has a lower caffeine load than regular black / Assam tea. And of the things the various sources agree on, it seems like a lot of the food items are things I enjoy a lot. I feel kinda lost here. On top of this, my work schedule sucks so things like pizza, take-out Chinese and select fast food joints are a regular (but not sole) part of my diet.",1,1727998411.0,FODMAPS,1,1.0,False

1fvlfs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SupplementZero/comments/1fvlfs0/my_experience_with_the_best_weight_loss/,My Experience with the Best Weight Loss Supplements for Women Over 40,"Hey ladies,

I wanted to share my weight loss journey as a 45 year old woman who's been battling the mid-life weight creep. 

I've tried a few popular supplements from Amazon and thought my experiences might help someone out there. 

**Garcinia Cambogia Extract**

I started with Garcinia Cambogia because it seemed to be everywhere. At first, I noticed my snacking habits improved because I wasn't reaching for chips as often. 

But over a month, the scale didn't budge much. I did have a few mild headaches, which I'm not sure were related. 

Some people experienced digestive issues, but I didn't experience that. It was okay, but not life changing for me.

**Apple Cider Vinegar Gummies**

I heard so much about ACV but couldn't stomach the liquid form, so gummies it was.

They tasted surprisingly good and helped with bloating. My digestion felt smoother, which was a nice perk. 

But in terms of weight loss, I didn't see much difference. Plus, I realized they're a bit sugary, which feels counterproductive. 

**Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA) Supplements**

I read that CLA can help with stubborn fat, so I decided to try it out. Over two months, I noticed my jeans were a tad looser around the waist. 

It wasn't a dramatic change, but progress is progress. Initially, I did have some minor stomach discomfort but it passed after a few days. 

Patience is key with this one because it works slowly but surely.

**Hydroxycut Hardcore Elite**

This one was intense! My energy levels skyrocketed and I had to remind myself to eat. 

I did notice some weight loss when I combined it with regular workouts but I felt quite jittery at times, and there were moments when my heart felt like it was racing. 

It made me a bit uneasy so I was really cautious with the dosage. 

**Green Coffee Bean Extract**

Let me tell you, my morning walks became power walks! I felt more energetic, which was great. 

The downside is that if I took it after noon, I'd be staring at the ceiling at midnight so that’s a lesson learned for me. 

Also, pairing it with my regular coffee made me a bit jittery. Overall, I still liked the subtle boost.

  


The **Green Coffee Bean Extract** was the winner for me. It gave me that extra energy boost without overwhelming me with side effects as long as I took it early in the day.

Take note that everyone's body reacts differently so what worked for me might not be the same for you. 

Also, it's important to pair any supplement with a balanced diet and exercise.

1fvlbz7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1fvlbz7/sleep_med_advice_needed/,Sleep med advice needed,"Hi all. I have been having sleep trouble for about 2 years. Issue is not insomnia, it is an inability to stay asleep and stay in deep sleep. I'm 54 years old and am still perimenopausal. I have an endocrinologist who does regular labs for my thyroid and also my hormones. She says my estrogen is high, so I am not ready for estrogen. I am, however on 200 mg of Progesterone. This past summer my endocrinologist put me on testosterone, and I LOVED it! My energy was better and I felt I was sleeping better, but my doctor reduced my dose, and now I'm back to not sleeping. I tried to talk to her about upping the testosterone again, but she wouldn't do it. Every night before bed, I take 2 Curcumasorb, 2 Cortisol Calm, 480 mg of Magnesium Glycinate, 3000 mg of Glycine and a CBD sleep aid. 

I believe my doctor suggested at one point that I could possibly do Trazodone, so I'm interested in learning about that or other options. I used to talk Lorazepam, but I understand it's not good to be on it long term, so I got off it. 

Also, I exercise most days,don't do coffee/caffeine, and cut off blue light an hour before bedtime. I also eat an early dinner with no snacks afterward, and try to keep a consistent bedtime. As said previously, falling asleep isn't the issue. Staying asleep/sleeping deeply is. 

Any thoughts for me on Trazodone? I'm currently taking Wellbutrin so I'm not sure if those Rxes would conflict. If you have ideas for any other medication that may be helpful, please let me know. ",2,1727997958.0,Menopause,2,1.0,False

In my 20s, it seemed so easy—friends from work, college, or social circles were always around. But now, most of my friends have either moved away, gotten married, or are busy with kids, and it’s been tough to maintain those connections.  
  
I’ve tried joining hobby groups and getting involved in activities, but it feels hard to form real connections at this stage of life. I miss having friends I can call up for a spontaneous coffee or hang out with on the weekend without having to schedule weeks in advance.  
  
I recently had a bit of extra cash from a lucky win, so I’m considering using it to sign up for a class or something similar where I might meet new people. But even then, it feels like everyone already has their established social circles, and it’s hard to break in.  
  
Has anyone else struggled with this? If you’ve found ways to make new friendships in your 30s, I’d love to hear what worked for you. Right now, I’m feeling a bit lost trying to navigate this phase of life.",45,1727997825.0,AskWomenOver30,12,0.96,False

Tomorrow I'm finally getting my camping stove. It has been so long since I have cooked anything. I'm getting all kinds of excited just thinking about it, the anticipation is killing me lol. 

I won't be able to cook anything until Saturday when I get my food stamps, but I'm already dreaming about the breakfast that I am going to fry up on Saturday morning oh yeah. 

I'm talking breakfast sausage, bacon, fried eggs (over easy), and some homemade potatoes O'Brien. 

 I know that I'm going to cook way too much for me to eat, so I think I'm just going to go to the park and find a couple random fellow homeless and share some of my glorious cooking. 

Thinking about it I probably better get a gallon of milk and a gallon of orange juice maybe some iced coffee (since I won't be able to brew real coffee for a while I only have one cast iron frying pan nothing to boil water with) to share too and I better pick up some paper cups tomorrow with the money I get from donating plasma.

I get visibly embarrassed telling customers how much their drinks cost. Today I had a woman get snippy with me because her caramel ribbon crunch came out to be over $7 with tax and she quite literally told me “it better be fixed by the next time she comes in or else there will be a problem” and the only thing I could do is chuckle and say okay to her and just be ungodly thankful I’m leaving. This company has harbored a clientele that is so incredibly entitled but at the same time i totally understand not wanting to pay that so it’s a lose lose situation. Perhaps I’d have more sympathy for the customers if this was a necessity but it’s not. It’s coffee. I’m just genuinely astonished at how dramatically this company fell off after I was hired. I was somehow making more money when the hiring wage was $10.15 than I do now when my wage is $17.60. I wish I could have stayed with the company longer. I was once so happy to have this job.

I drink a lot of milk - either in cereal, tea, coffee or a glass,  my dad and sis have it in tea or cereal, and mum have it in those and coffee.


Lately, the McCallum's Aldi milk we've been having has honestly been so weird - not tasting off per say. But generally, after 1-2 days of being open, a week from the Use by, it develops a foul smell that's very different from off milk smell, and the taste is even worse.

I honestly don't even know how to describe it.

But in their tea, coffee and cereal, the rest of my family have noticed it. We've tried other home brand milks from HB and Lidl and same result. We've switched to Graham's or Cravendale for now which don't have the issue, but it's not exactly affordable for our family.

Just want to see if anyone else has experienced this, and perhaps if not, go buy a McCallum's milk from Aldi Newton mearns and test it for us.

They are the sole provider for their household, make decent money ($200k+ / Year), with 4 Kids (youngest is 3), married 10 years, and live in an average sized household (1400 sq/ft). They should easily be able to afford their fixed expenses while still having money left over for savings, but due to their partner's repeated overspending habits they are constantly in debt. A lot of this spending are small, daily things that add up over the course of the month. Lots of clothing for their kids (that they don't need), eating out, coffees to go, trips they can't afford, and in general things they don't need (for example: my friend's spouse forced them to finance a brand new mini-van instead of purchasing used. Threatened divorce if they did not go brand new, meanwhile my friend drives a beat up car with over 200k km on it). My friend also is paying for their spouse's schooling, which they are about to graduate (and in theory be able to find a decent paying career after). My friend rarely spends money on them self (uses a 10 year old phone, doesn't have any hobbies because they can't spend money on them self without their partner getting mad). This partner is 100% uncooperative when it comes to budgeting and refuses to discuss the issue at all... any time budgeting is brought up there is an instant threat of ""I want a divorce"" or ""this is financial abuse""  and then they completely refuse to communicate. Recently my friend's spouse maxed our their own personal credit card ($10k+ in debt) and asked then my friend to start taking money out of their own personal line of credit to pay it off, but my friend refused and it instantly lead to the threat of divorce / never see your children / etc. Their partner refuses to see any counselors, financial advisers, or discuss the topic in any way, shape, or form. They are also extremely toxic towards my friend, constantly berate them (even in public), and as my friend put it ""they haven't done or said a single nice thing to me for years"". (I've seen this myself many times during social events). In the event of divorce, my friend's partner has repeatedly made it clear that they would go out of their way to ruin my friend as much as they can (so I would expect uncooperative divorce filings). I am trying to advise my friend to seek divorce immediately, but they want to stick it out for their children (fear of not getting joint custody) and for fear of being financially ruined for the rest of their life. 

  
My questions are: When it comes to divorce in Alberta, does a partners overspending and refusal to cooperate / fix marital issues affect any court rulings? Does any of this constitute emotional or spousal abuse and how would that affect any court rulings? Does any of this factor in or are divorce settlements simply ""you make XX, they make 0, you have 4 kids therefore you pay XX"". ",5,1727996715.0,legaladvicecanada,5,0.86,False

After 3 years SHIB has already removed HALF the total supply from existence and continues to BURN more on its own through ShibTorch.

1fvkst7,https://www.reddit.com/r/AdsRuinEverything/comments/1fvkst7/an_update_ads_just_keep_ruining_everything/,An update. Ads just keep ruining everything. ,"Hello everyone. Not updated the sub in a while. After the whole reddit fucking Apollo thing I did say was gonna pull back a bit. 

But the thing I want to say.. yep, ads just keep making things worse. I have a Xbox Gamepass sub. Recently I downgraded from the Premium level to the Standard level as I was not getting the full benefit of the premium service. And it turns out the Premium level was keeping the Microsoft Solitaire Collection ad free. Not just banners, full video unskippable ads that play between games. I liked to play it daily over my morning coffee, but now I don’t want to do that anymore… in fact i just want to delete the app all together. Don’t care about all the score levels I’ve accumulated. I just wanted to play some solitaire without someone wannabe influencer yelling at me about fucking Battle Clash or some shit. 

Also I was hoping for a backlash for the Amazon Prime adding ads thing. I was hoping it would lead to exodus of people unsubscribing that they would have had second thoughts, stop the ads, and issue a grovelling “you told us, we listened” email. But no, the majority didn’t care and the ads are here. I care though, and I now watch Prime content less because of it (on a yearly sub that I will not be fucking renewing), the OG Prime content have little to no ads on them. Amazon originals only seem to have pre rolls, while the Grand Tour finales special had no ads at all.. but none original content like “Batman: The Caped Crusader” have will have pre roll ads and mid roll block about halfway through. So it’s BS but it’s tolerable for now. But I now hear Amazon want to increase the amount ads in 2025. Fucking Hell, not only did the ads not drive people away, Amazon the pricks have seen it as a success and are now doubling down. Prime is becoming like the free version of YouTube… but you pay for it! Well fuck ‘em.. they don’t have enough content I care about to stick around. 

OK had to vent. Will try to post stuff like pics and videos on what the sub is about in future. But those that stuck around, Thank You. And Fuck Ads!

1fvkrwk,https://www.reddit.com/r/KeepWriting/comments/1fvkrwk/the_hooligan_returns/,The Hooligan Returns,"	 An old man sits in the desert sun as if basking in the glories of the world. He sits and he thinks as he sips his morning coffee.



	‘A hooligan’ he thought to himself. ‘And what could this mean’ he continued. 



	The soul of a man flows like a river displacing the dirt and sediment around it but what remains is the gold. But that gold comes with the echoing of the satanic laughter. A lingering feeling that is best felt not heard. 



	So what to do about the nature of the soul? The old man, the hooligan thought to himself. Before setting out on any sort of journey a man must reevaluate the nature of the beast to come. A journey set before a God on a throne. A journey that comes with the sacrifice of the self. A longing for a home is not present in this soul because a home was never known. 



	‘A hooligan has his fun but a God plays his games’ the old man thought to himself. ‘A hooligan plays his games too and all glory in the madness of it all’ the old man continued to think on the matter. 



	The old man was caught in his mind like lightning in a bottle on display for all to see. The captive audience, the many faces of the hooligan were caught in the trance that was the lightning in a bottle. 



	To think of this poor soul is to think of you or me. To be captive by his own insights is to be captivated by all that is, by all that is held sacred. 



	So the old man, the hooligan reborn, sought out a question, ‘What should this hooligan do for the days that approach? What should this old soul, this worn-down, beaten-down fragment of all that could be do with the remainder of his days? And with this question again the old man felt more than he heard, a satanic laughter. It was as if the ages themselves were laughing at this joke that was both man and God. 



	‘A hooligan is only out for a good time’ The satanic riddles began and with them the old man knew that he had played his game, but had been played by the keenest of minds. ‘And who is this hooligan? A newfound presence within the dark chasms of his soul. Is he the audience at this time? Or is he more of a friend in search of a good time?’ The old man thought to himself as if too apprehensive to approach that newfound friend. 



	‘What matters is the glories of this world and nothing more.’ He heard that satanic riddle start again. ‘But what does this have to do with the nature of my soul? There are a million questions to ask this. Are you God? It cannot be for your glory in the flesh rather than the heights of us mortals. Are you a fiend? If so am I in need of an exorcist?’ The old man sat back and waited. 



	It is never quite sure why an old soul clings to all that he knows. It is only sure that all he knows is the only thing worth clinging to. But this old soul was never left with a clear conscious. This old soul was left only with the wounds of his days. 



	‘Tell me hooligan, where do we go from here?’ The devilish fiend continued as if just glancing over the questions of the old man. And with this thought that came from something other than him the old man felt an apprehensive joy rising out of him. ‘I suppose I could say I want to have fun’ the old man responded. ‘If a good time is what you seek than all lies at your feet.’ came a response. 



	And so it was two in one came the pair hellbent on devouring all the glories that the world had to offer all the while knowing that the destruction of the flesh were the only glories worth chasing. 



	Deep within the old man knew he would be played. Deep within the old man knew that the hooligan within was the dominant one. Nevertheless that devilish soul could not help but to play along with the game of the God, for the old man knew within that he was a God. Unlike any other God that he had ever heard of but much like them in every way. 



	‘The mortals play a game but they are never the victors. The mortals never have their way. The only true path is the path that gives glory to the heavenly souls. Nevertheless, those bold souls who venture into that dark quiet solace of divinity, not to be shared with man, play the game as if they are the victors. But it is a fun one to play.’ The old man thought to himself never actually giving into his desire to run from the fiend. 



	I suppose you could say that this old man sitting in the desert is one that is worthy of the game. Or you could say that the Gods choose the most foolish of beasts to receive from them. Nevertheless, the game was set and the players were ready to give quite the show. And so it was that the show was set to go on and that old man who wore his deeds with the scars on his soul was all but ready to play his part. 



	The old man stood to his feet and decided that he had had enough of that black bitter coffee for the day. But where he was set to go was unknown. Again it is said that that old man had no home to speak of and that he never knew the comforts of a home. So I suppose it could also be said that the destination never quite mattered. 



	So the old man continued to question and continued to pester as a child does to the adult of his choosing. And it was that the old man decided to seek within the glories of the destruction of the flesh. 



	He knew this game all to well. For the scars on both his body and his soul were a testament to this fact. He may have no recollection of the glories found in the destruction of his flesh but he knew all to well that he would play the game according to the nature of the newfound fiend within. 

	‘All is not loss, young soul.’ came a softer more gentle voice that did not carry the weight of the satanic laughter. This particular God had a gentle touch. And again he heard it said ‘all is not loss, young soul.’ But as to who said the riddle was unbeknownst to that old man sitting in the desert. 



	‘I suppose I could seek that which is always found. I suppose the path before me is the path that has always stood before me. And I suppose that this connection with the devilish fiend may stretch back to my early days.’ the old man said to himself.



	Then came a sudden realization. As if some gold surfaced to someone just walking along a riverbed. ‘The soul is not what man has and it is not what man does but the soul is a slave to all that is divine, just, and true.’ the old man thought. This thought came as an anchor. This thought came bringing new life into the soul. 



	‘All is not loss, young soul’ the old man thought to himself. ‘All is not loss, young soul’ and with this thought, just a mimicry of what was spoken moments ago came the weight of conviction. But a conviction not set within the boundaries of time. For if all is not loss then there is more to gain. But all that is gained are the scars of his body and soul.

1fvkruo,https://i.redd.it/3ksrxgacgmsd1.jpeg,Just a little background on Jerry Stiller and Anne Meara,"Jerry Stiller on meeting Anne Meara: ""She seemed to sense I had no money, so she just ordered coffee. Then she took all the silverware. I picked up her check for ten cents and thought, 'This is a girl I'd like to hang out with.'
Meara met Stiller in 1953, and they married in 1955, after a two-year relationship. Until he suggested it, she had never thought of doing comedy. ""Jerry started us being a comedy team,"" she said. ""He always thought I would be a great comedy partner."" They joined the Chicago improvisational company The Compass Players (which later became The Second City), and after leaving, formed the comedy team of Stiller and Meara. In 1961, they were performing in nightclubs in New York, and by the following year were considered a ""national phenomenon,"" said the New York Times. 
Their often improvised comedy routines brought many of their relationship foibles to live audiences. Their skits focused on domestic themes, as did Nichols and May, another comedy team during that period from the Chicago Compass Players project. ""They were Nichols and May without the acid and with warmth,"" notes author Lawrence Epstein. They also added a new twist to their comedy act, he adds, by sometimes playing up the fact that Stiller was Jewish and Meara was Catholic. After Nichols and May broke up as a team in 1961, Stiller and Meara were the number-one couple comedy team by the late 1960s. And as Mike Nichols and Elaine May were not married, Stiller and Meara became the most famous married couple comedy team since Burns and Allen. 
Though Meara was born, baptized, and raised a Roman Catholic, she converted to Judaism six years after marrying Stiller. She took her conversion seriously and studied the Jewish faith in such depth that her Jewish-born husband quipped, ""Being married to Anne has made me more Jewish.""

All told they had “addictions” they needed to repent of…

Ive lost all trust in church approved therapists. They know better but still push the Mormon agenda. 

It wasn’t until i was a paramedic that i finally saw what addiction really is. The life destroying, brain damaging desperation of people literally falling apart from substances that controlled their life. 

Thankfully now, an “addiction” to Dr Pepper just sounds comical.

The week prior I avoided seeds, grains and anything containing them. I followed the low residue diet.

3 days prior I began consuming soft foods, such as pureed soups to ease digestion.

1 day prior I fasted and did not eat. I consumed only clear liquids, such as chicken broth, tea and coffee, black, and clear powerade active water.

I started prep the night before my colonoscopy by making the bathroom as cosy as possible. I started at 4:30pm and was finished before 9pm.

I moved a chair into the bathroom to lean on and placed a pillow ontop. I brought a soft blanket to put over my legs to keep warm and put on soft warm socks and a soft warm sweater.

I brought my phone charger in, incase I needed it. And brought my tablet in to watch a show I'd already chosen for when evacuation started. 

I used a potty training toilet seat to support my pelvic floor and reduce the load on my hemorrhoids. And it worked!!! I leaned over the chair instead of sitting upright to reduce the weight and I did not push. 

I mixed the first liter in cold tap water, had a tall glass to pour into. I chugged the first glass, leaving 3 more per litre. After chugging I chased with powerade active water to remove the salty taste. I'd then immediately pour the next glass so it visually looked less daunting. I continued to drink as much and as fast as I could without becoming nauseous. For the first liter, this was all 4 glasses in 45 minutes. For the second, it was a full glass, followed by half glasses every 5-10 minutes. I finished the 2 liters in 1.5 hours and continued to drink the powerade active water.

Evacuation started after the first hour, so I brought the mixture and powerade into the bathroom to get it done with in the least time possible. For me, it was less than 5 hours.

After the night prep was finished, I drank a couple cups of warm chicken broth and continued to drink the powerade active water throughout the night. 

I had split prep, so had to take another liter in the morning and did the same thing. 

I minimized the shakes and was overall pretty comfortable given the situation with my setup and distractions. 

My Boston bowel prep score was a 9. I only took the glycoprep 3 liter prep.

I hope this helps someone else out there.

Since I work so close to him I’ve seen it all, the good the bad, the ugly. I’ve seen him get upset, scream, and say things that aren’t very nice. I’ve also seen him sick, poop left in the toilet and dirty skid mark underwear left around. I see how terrible his eating habits are, he is overweight and primarily eats processed foods around me and makes tons of sugary cups of coffee when I’m there. He also just has bad habits, some of which are my biggest pet peeves. Time blindness for example. I genuinely don’t think he’s ever been on time once. He also has a cringey sense of humor and vocabulary that’s so bad it’s like nails against a chalkboard sometimes. I’ve also seen posts here giving scenarios to think about to gross yourself out by you LO on here.

None of it works, every flaw makes him more perfect in my eyes even though I know it shouldn’t. It doesn’t make any sense. I don’t work with him often at all anymore but it hasn’t gotten easier. I’ve gone on meds but I still cry almost every day about him, some days I cry for hours and hours on end. I really think the only thing that could help is getting rejected and I fantasize often about telling him how I feel. I wonder if he knew if he would feel bad for me, I want him to feel bad for me.

# Introduction

We all need dopamine in our lives. It’s the neurotransmitter that governs essential functions like movement, memory, motivation, behavior, attention, mood, and sleep. So much of what we do is influenced by this powerful chemical. It’s the driver behind our pursuit of pleasure and novelty—and the very substance that companies capitalize on to keep us hooked in the endless scroll of the internet.

In today’s digital-first world, we’re constantly nudged to chase online dopamine. Whether it’s the ping of a notification, a celebrity’s latest post, or a viral video shared among friends, the internet provides a constant stream of novelty, all designed to keep us engaged. We carry dopamine-triggering devices—our smartphones and laptops—because we’ve adapted to a convenience-driven lifestyle. What many don’t realize, though, is that this cycle is fueled by dopamine, the brain’s reward chemical. Over time, our dependence on these quick, fleeting dopamine hits takes a toll on our mental well-being, productivity, and overall happiness.

So, how do we break free from this cycle? The answer lies in discovering and engaging with offline dopamine—finding novelty and joy in the real world, beyond the confines of a screen. The good news is that dopamine isn’t confined to the digital realm. Some of the most fulfilling sources of dopamine come from offline activities that meaningfully engage our minds and bodies. The challenge is to retrain ourselves to pursue these experiences and leave the void of shallow dopamine behind.

Let’s dive into how we can tap into these offline sources and cultivate a deeper, more lasting sense of satisfaction in the world around us.

# Finding Novelty Offline

The beauty of offline dopamine is that it encourages us to slow down, be present, and find joy in the simple, often overlooked things around us. Unlike the constant barrage of quick hits we get online, offline dopamine provides a more natural, sustainable way to experience pleasure and fulfillment. It doesn’t demand endless stimulation or constant attention. Instead, it invites us to reconnect with ourselves and the world in meaningful ways.

Below, I’ll start with some low-friction activities that offer offline dopamine, then gradually move into more lifestyle-driven choices. The goal is to retrain our brains to prefer offline dopamine sources, allowing us to move away from the cycle of digital exploitation and towards a more balanced, enriching life.

# Low-Friction Offline Dopamine Hits

These are activities that require minimal effort but provide immediate satisfaction. They’re a great way to begin shifting your focus from the digital to the real world.

* Take a 10-minute walk without your phone: A brief outdoor stroll can stimulate dopamine and reset your brain. The sights, sounds, and smells of nature or urban environments offer gentle novelty, providing a calming dopamine source that can boost mood and well-being.1
* Listen to music mindfully: My friend Justin from Currentss introduced me to the idea of a listening party, which has completely changed how I engage with music. Instead of using music as background noise while multitasking, a listening party is about being attentive to the music. Take time to enjoy a full album, a few songs, or even just one track. Focus entirely on the melody, the lyrics, and the rhythm. This intentional listening allows for a deeper, more satisfying musical experience.
* Read a short book: Remember how rewarding it was to dive into a picture book as a child? That joy never really goes away. Reading offers a slower, more immersive experience than scrolling through social media, and it doesn’t have to be a lengthy novel. A simple five-minute session with a picture book or magazine provides just enough novelty to engage your brain and help it reset. It’s a low-effort way to gain offline dopamine while enjoying a moment of calm and focus.

# Moderate Engagement: Transitioning to More Involved Offline Dopamine

Once you’ve started with smaller steps, you can begin introducing activities that require a bit more time and effort but offer greater fulfillment. These help you build a more sustained relationship with offline novelty.

* Engage in Creative Hobbies: Whether it’s painting, writing, photography, cooking, or building LEGO sets, creative activities provide a steady release of dopamine. I’ve personally set aside time every Monday evening to build LEGO sets and follow the instructions. Unlike the instant but short-lived gratification you get from online content, creative hobbies require focus and patience, making the dopamine hit more rewarding and longer-lasting. The sense of accomplishment when you create something new or finish a project (Darth Vader will be done this upcoming week!) is deeply satisfying and can give you a sustained chemical boost.
* Work from a Coffee Shop/Park/Etc: Although you may still be connected to the internet for work purposes, the change in environment from the office to a third place like a coffee shop offers novelty that can enhance your experience. If your job doesn’t allow for a full day of working remotely, consider asking for a few hours every other week to work from a different location. The sensory stimulation—the smell of coffee, background conversations, and the bustling atmosphere—provides a fresh experience that can increase mood and productivity.
* Attend a local class: Learning something new in a structured environment is a powerful way to engage with offline dopamine and new people. Whether it’s picking up a new language, exploring woodworking, or learning to play an instrument, the process of developing a new skill brings long-lasting satisfaction. It’s an experience that not only boosts confidence but also contributes to a sense of personal growth and accomplishment. Check out your local community college, library, or community center to see what’s available around you.
* Meet Friends Face-to-Face: While the Internet offers convenience, in-person interactions provide a depth of connection that digital communication can't match. Face-to-face meetings with friends, family, or colleagues create richer, more meaningful experiences. The nuances of facial expressions, body language, and shared laughter contribute to a sense of connection that virtual interactions struggle to replicate. Consider scheduling regular in-person meetups: share a meal together, take a walk in nature, or engage in a shared hobby or activity.

# Lifestyle-Driven Offline Dopamine

Once you're comfortable with smaller changes, consider making larger, lifestyle-driven choices that further prioritize offline dopamine and create a more balanced, intentional life.

* Exercise with a Routine: While physical activity is well-known for its dopamine-releasing benefits, embedding it into a structured routine offers both mental and physical rewards. Instead of sporadic gym visits, create a consistent schedule—whether it's running every morning, attending yoga classes twice a week, or following a personalized workout plan. Committing to a routine turns exercise into a rewarding habit that builds over time, reinforcing positive behavior through consistent dopamine boosts.
* Implement Daily Planning and Reflection: Incorporating structured organizational patterns, such as daily planning and reflection, can lead to consistent offline dopamine rewards. Start your week with a simple planning routine. Take time to reflect on your achievements and areas for improvement. These powerful practices provide a sense of accomplishment and allow for more intentional living.
* Schedule Regular ""Dopamine Reset"" Days: Build digital detox days into your schedule—times when you deliberately disconnect from all screens and online activities. The longer you can make these days happen, the better it’ll be for your brain. These days can be dedicated to offline hobbies, socializing, or self-care without the interference of technology. Go for a hike or rest, just make sure to prioritize offline!

Over time, the novelty and richness of these offline activities can become a more sustainable and fulfilling source of dopamine than scrolling through your social media feed.

# Conclusion: Embrace Offline Dopamine Gradually

Breaking the digital dopamine cycle isn’t about going cold turkey—it’s about starting small and gradually incorporating offline activities that bring lasting joy and novelty into your life. By focusing first on low-effort dopamine hits and working your way up to more lifestyle-driven changes, you can retrain your brain to seek fulfillment from the world around you. Over time, you’ll find that these real-world experiences not only offer deeper satisfaction but also help you escape the superficial highs of constant online engagement. Life’s true richness comes from being present, connected, and engaged with the people and activities that bring meaning, not just scrolling through a screen.

Remember, dopamine isn’t exclusive to the digital world. There’s an abundance of offline experiences that offer the same dopamine rewards—whether through nature, creative hobbies, learning, or connecting with others face-to-face. These moments are not only achievable but essential for living a balanced and more intentional life.

The next time you feel the itch to grab your phone, take a moment to pause. Instead of reaching for the next quick digital hit, try scheduling just one offline activity this week—a walk in nature, a creative hobby, or a face-to-face meet-up with a friend. Notice how it feels. The more you explore offline novelty, the more you’ll discover that the real world offers a deeper, more fulfilling kind of dopamine—one that nourishes your mind and enriches your life in ways the internet simply can’t.

So I got it and got my free coffee and bagel bites :) on a different day, I asked my friend if they wanted to get Dunkin together and they said yes and I went first in the cashier and she said that I needed to buy something else. I was at first confused, but then she clarified I need to get something else to get the free medium drink. “Oh I’m not a new member, I’m just scanning for points” but the cashier said it’s still going to be free if I get something else and I just said I’ll take an order of hash browns to pay just $1.50. Then my friend goes to order and I was like let me just scan it to gain more points and I’ll pay for the order. They were hesitant at first but I told them the five bucks is literally not something they should mention, and I meant it too. They are such a good friend and deserve it. 

Fast forward to the next day, or today. They were giving out free five dollar Dunkin gift cards and person gave me two! 

I was so amazed at like what are the chances yk? Like it was a matter of a day. I had some cash on me and some some frat guys asking for a couple bucks to pie them and raise money for ovarian cancer and just gave them 5 and walked away bcs I know what that cancer does to people, it’s horrific. Then, I got a 10 dollar gift card from doing a survey later that hour! Like what! I’m telling you, give from your heart and your pockets will grow! Time to go on more coffee dates with people I love :)",3,1727995776.0,Pitt,2,0.57,False
