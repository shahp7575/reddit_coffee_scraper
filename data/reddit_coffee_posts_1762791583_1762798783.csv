I’m just putting this out there hoping to meet someone fun to chat with. I’m a guy who loves binge watching movies, but I also like getting outside, grabbing a coffee, or exploring new spots to see where the day takes me.

If you’re into good conversation, a few laughs, or even some lighthearted banter, send me a message. No pressure, just curious to see who’s out there and maybe make a new connection.

The case completely fried and one of the earbuds stopped working too. Since I use them for work calls constantly I just ordered a new pair for like $250 which honestly hurt even though I do have some money set aside for stuff like this. But still, didnt want to dip into that for something this stupid you know? I remembered seeing something about purchase protection when I got my chase freedom flex last year. Decided to look it up and turns out they cover accidental damage up to $500 for stuff you buy with the card. Filed a claim online with pictures of the fried case and receipt, and they approved it. Getting the full $250 back as a statement credit which is honestly amazing since I was NOT expecting that at all. The whole process took maybe 15 mins to file and they responded quick.

​For months, my room was just a big pile of things. It felt heavy, not just with clothes and papers, but with all the worry and tiredness I had ignored. I slept right next to these pile of clutter. The books I never opened, shirts I didn't fold, and trash that should have been in the garbage months ago. My room wasn't relaxing, instead it was a constant, silent reminder of everything I hadn't done. Just walking into the door meant accepting the mess, and every time I did, I felt a little heavier.

​Then all of a sudden, the switch flipped. I started cleaning, and it felt like digging through old history. I had to sort through weeks of forgotten things: old receipts, empty mugs with grime from the dried up residue of the coffee I drank, and the piling mess on top of my piano. It was a lot of hard work, a lot of bending and lifting and making difficult decisions about where things belonged.
​But every shelves I filled, and every shirt I folded, made the room breathe a little easier. It was a physical job, and as the floor slowly started to appear, the heavy feeling in the air began to lift. The worst part was over when the last big surface was clear and the garbage was out my room. 

​Finally, everything is clear. As if I heard my room took a deep breath of relief. The visual mess was gone. The floor is clean and it's good to see again the space that I hadn't seen in months, and despite my room being small, the light felt brighter and the air felt clean and sharp, like after a storm. This is the feeling of relief. It's the simple joy of having space to think and move.

​And now, the biggest hope settles in— that this feeling, this incredible peace, will stick around. I know life gets busy, and the clutter always tries to creep back in, but I really, truly wish that this time, my room will stay clean for more than just one good week. It's a fresh, clean page, and I'm going to try my best to keep it that way.",1,1762798309.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False

You’re asked if you have rewards for a haircut, you’re asked if you want to join when you tell the cashier no. 

It’s the same thing all over now. I’ve noticed that these days when I tell a cashier that I don’t have rewards, they don’t even ask and they pull up the screen to have you put your phone number in to join their program. They didn’t even ask if I wanted to join. I couldn’t even decline it from my end unless I cancel the entire checkout process. The cashier acted a bit annoyed when I did that, she points out that I canceled the order and they have to scan everything again. She asks me why I did that and I just calmly state “well I didn’t want to join the rewards program and I thought the red button would just decline the rewards program offer.” 

I’ve also had times where I would tell the cashier that I don’t have rewards, and when they ask if I want to join I’ll just give them a “No” and make sure my body language shows that I have zero interest in joining. Sometimes the cashier will try to sway my choice too with an “are you sure??” When I respond with “yes” they’ve pulled the “ooookay.” Like I’m missing out on something.

RateYourMusic is a website that enables its users to rate any music they like. Anyone can rate any given track on a scale from 0.5 to 5, and the average ratings are visible to all RYM subscribers. A very recently added feature of RateYourMusic is [the song charts](https://rateyourmusic.com/charts/top/song/all-time/), a freely customisable online resource for discovering the best-rated tracks in any genre or period of time, also providing similar charts for each individual artist.

Car Seat Headrest are a fan favourite over at RYM, nine songs of theirs making it to [RYM's Top 1,000 Highest-Rated Tracks of all time](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2XVc9E8tEkpBz7z8wZbMul?si=1452174b4b9446f9). Three albums by CSH, including both versions of Twin Fantasy, are ranked in the top 10 for their respective year of release, the 2018 Face to Face re-recording topping the annual chart and currently ranking #123. 

The chart features almost 40 songs rated higher than 4.3, which may well be a record of some sort (I'm sure The Beatles and Natural Snow Buildings fare better, though). There's no weight given to any of the tracks, so there's disproportionate representation for lesser-known tracks that may have been only voted on by the die-hard fans.

1otl4sw,https://www.reddit.com/r/rva_housing/comments/1otl4sw/new_to_richmond/,New to Richmond,"I'll be visiting this weekend to get an idea of different neighborhoods etc. but also looking for local advice. I like walkable neighborhoods. I want to be able to walk to a coffee shop, convenience store, bars, restaurants etc. on sidewalks and not feel like I'm either going to get hit by a car or attacked by a stranger. Based on that, I keep hearing about the Fan and Scott's Addition. This brings me to housing. (For reference budget is $2500/month, 2bed 1.5 bath minimum, cat friendly).

Scott's Addition: Seems to be all renovated industrial buildings/poor new constructions charging minimum $2500/month but with many reviews noting the poor quality of the contructions, paper thin walls etc. Also, on Google Maps, maybe the street view is outdated but the neighborhood looks depressing and...scary. I'm no stranger to urban living, but the street view of Scott's Addition made me feel depressed about moving to Richmond.

The Fan: Seems to be old buildings run by slum lords for a hefty price and no amenities.

I'm mainly looking for a place, that, as I said is walkable, but I'm also hoping to find community. So the big apartment complexes that do social events for their residents is appealing to me, but I'm having trouble finding one that doesn't have some deal-breaking reviews (homeless people sleeping in the hallways, paper thin walls, cockroaches, regular flooding, etc.). Any recommendations for good-quality apartment complexes in my budget? Is my budget unrealistic for what I'm looking for? I don't care about unnecessary amenities like pet spas, but I would like a functional gym and resident social activities, at a minimum. Are there different neighborhoods I should be looking at?

A pet ""accident."" A toddler's art project gone rogue. If you've ever had a rug, you know this feeling. Your heart sinks as you stare at the stain, knowing that beautiful (and expensive) floor covering is probably ruined.

Enter Ruggable. The brand that promised a revolution: a beautiful rug you can actually throw in the washing machine.

It sounds like magic, but it comes with a hefty price tag. So, the big question on everyone's mind is: **Are Ruggable rugs actually worth the money?**

After months of testing, deep-diving into user reviews, and talking to owners, I’m giving you the brutally honest breakdown. No fluff, just the facts you need to decide if a Ruggable is right for your home.

---

## First Off, What Exactly Is a Ruggable?

Let's get this straight. A Ruggable isn't one single item; it's a clever two-part system.

*   **The Rug Cover:** This is the pretty part. It's the decorative top layer with all the patterns and colors. It's made from a lightweight, stain-resistant material with a special ClingEffect™ grip.
*   **The Rug Pad:** This is the functional base layer. It’s a non-slip, cushioned pad that you lay down on the floor first. It provides comfort, safety, and is what the cover clings to.

You roll out the pad, smooth the cover on top, and voilà! You have a ""rug"" that looks seamless but can be taken apart in seconds. This two-part system is the secret to its washability.

## The ""Pros"" - Why People Are Obsessed with Ruggable

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=are%20Ruggable%20rugs%20worth%20it%3F)

Let's start with the good stuff. There's a reason this brand has a cult following.

### **1. It's Genuinely, Truly Washable**
This isn't just ""spot cleanable."" You can rip the cover off, stuff it in a standard home washing machine (a 7kg/15lb capacity or larger is recommended), and wash away a shocking number of stains. Red wine, coffee, mud, pet urine—you name it. For parents and pet owners, this benefit alone can be worth the price.

### **2. Incredible Convenience**
The lightweight cover is a dream to handle. It's easy to lift, fold, and carry to the laundry room. This is a massive contrast to struggling with a heavy, traditional rug. It also makes vacuuming and moving furniture a breeze.

### **3. Pet & Kid-Friendly Superpower**
Ruggable markets itself to this demographic for a reason. The rugs are:
*   **Stain-Resistant:** Liquids bead up on the surface initially, giving you time to blot.
*   **Hypoallergenic:** A regular wash removes dust, dander, and allergens that get trapped in traditional rugs.
*   **Durable (for messes):** You don't have to panic every time there's a spill. Peace of mind is a powerful thing.

### **4. Massive Design Selection**
From minimalist solids to boho chic and even artist collaborations, Ruggable has a design for nearly every taste. You can also swap out covers seasonally or whenever you get bored with your decor without buying a whole new rug system.

## The ""Cons"" - The Brutally Honest Downsides

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=are%20Ruggable%20rugs%20worth%20it%3F)

Okay, now for the part you *really* need to hear. Ruggable is not perfect.

### **1. The Price Point is High**
Let's be real: Ruggables are expensive. You're not just buying a rug; you're buying a system. A 5x7 rug can easily run you $200-$400, and larger sizes can climb into the thousands. For that price, you could buy a high-quality, traditional wool or cotton rug.

### **2. The Texture is... Different**
This is the most common complaint. If you're expecting a thick, plush, luxurious-feeling rug, you will be disappointed. Ruggable covers are thin. They feel more like a high-quality, durable blanket or a low-pile commercial carpet. Many describe it as ""flimsy"" or ""not cozy."" The pad adds some cushion, but it won't replicate the feel of a shag rug.

### **3. The Washing Process Isn't Always ""Magic""**
While washable, the process has its quirks:
*   **It's a Project:** You need a large, front-loading washer. Laundromats are an option, but that's a hassle.
*   **Drying:** You can put it in the dryer on low heat, but it can take multiple cycles. Air-drying is recommended but can take over 24 hours.

### **4. The Pad Can Slide**
While the non-slip pad is good, it's not foolproof. On very slick surfaces like polished hardwood or vinyl, some users find the whole system can still bunch up or slide, especially with active dogs or kids running around.

## So, Who Should Buy a Ruggable?

Ruggables are a fantastic investment for a specific type of person:

*   **The Pet Owner:** You are tired of your carpets smelling like your dog and your rugs looking like a map of old accidents. The ability to deep-clean on a whim is a game-changer.
*   **The Parent of Young Children:** Spills are not a possibility; they are a daily certainty. Ruggable saves your sanity.
*   **The Renter or Decorator:** You love changing your style frequently and want an easy way to swap out looks without breaking the bank or your back.
*   **The Allergy Sufferer:** Being able to regularly wash away dust mites and dander provides genuine health benefits.

## Who Should Probably Skip It?

Save your money if you are:

*   **The Luxury Seeker:** You prioritize a deep, plush, luxurious feel under your feet above all else. You want a rug that feels like an heirloom piece.
*   **The Strict Budget Shopper:** There are far cheaper rug options available if washability isn't your primary concern.
*   **Someone Without Easy Laundry Access:** If you have to trek to a laundromat every time the rug is dirty, the convenience factor is completely lost.

## The Final Verdict: Are Ruggable Rugs Worth It?

**Yes, but only if you're buying it for the right reason.**

You aren't paying for a luxury, high-end textile rug. You're paying for **unparalleled convenience and peace of mind.**

Think of it this way: a Ruggable is the ""performance athleisure"" of the rug world. It's not a formal suit, but it's perfect for your active, messy, everyday life.

If your main priority is a rug that can handle life's messes without stressing you out, then a Ruggable is 100% worth the investment. If your main priority is a specific tactile feeling or a traditional, luxurious aesthetic, you will likely be disappointed.

Choose your rug based on your lifestyle, not just on looks, and you'll make the right choice.

### **Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)**

**Q: Can you put a Ruggable in the dryer?**
**A:** Yes, on a low heat, tumble-dry setting. However, many users prefer to air-dry to prevent any potential shrinking and prolong the life of the cover.

**Q: Do Ruggables actually clean well in the wash?**
**A:** For the vast majority of organic stains and spills, they clean exceptionally well. For oil-based stains, you may need to pre-treat with a stain remover first.

**Q: How long do Ruggables last?**
**A:** The rug cover can last for years with proper washing. The non-slip pad tends to wear out faster (2-3 years) as its grip and cushioning degrade. Luckily, you can buy replacement pads without buying a whole new system.

**Q: Can you use a different rug pad with a Ruggable cover?**
**A:** It's not recommended. The cover is designed to work with Ruggable's proprietary ClingEffect™ pads. Using a different pad will likely result in the cover slipping and bunching up constantly.",1,1762798064.0,WashableRug,0,1.0,False
1otl3xk,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1otl3xk/found_out_my_local_library_has_private_study_pods/,Found out my local library has private study pods,"I've been struggling with focus while working from home for months. My apartment is tiny and my roommate is loud, plus I kept getting distracted by literally everything. Coffee shops were getting expensive and crowded. I randomly discovered that my public library has these small private study rooms that you can book for free. Like actual rooms with doors, decent wifi, and complete silence. I had no idea this existed.

Been using them for two weeks now and my productivity has honestly skyrocketed. I get more done in 3 hours there than I used to in an entire day at home. Plus I've had some money aside that now I can use for something else, that I was planning to spend it on coworking spaces since the situation was becoming unbearable. The booking system lets you reserve up to 2 hours at a time online. I usually book two sessions back to back with a 15 minute break to walk around.

Why this works for me:

\-Zero distractions (no kitchen to raid, no bed to tempt me)

\-Other people around actually being productive puts me in the right mindset

\-Having a ""commute"" even if it's just 10 minutes helps my brain switch modes

\-Free and quiet beats expensive and noisy

I know this might be obvious to some people but I genuinely never thought to check what services my library offered beyond books. Now I'm wondering what other productivity resources are hiding in plain sight around my city.",10,1762798046.0,productivity,0,1.0,False

I tried asking girls out a couple of times in middle school, didn't try in high school, and tried a few times on apps in college.

I still feel down sometimes, but it's not as bad as it was. So, if you're one of those people, and you're reading this, thank you.

Anyway, I have been going to this diner for almost two years. All the waitresses there were really cute, and I felt like they were way out of my league. Well, about three months ago, I started talking with one of the girls (which seemed impossible at the time, because I'm an extremely shy person). They were never super long conversations (1-2 min), so it took a while to get to know a bit about her. She's very sweet and bubbly, though I'm not sure if she's a Christian. (Not ideal, I know.)

I haven't asked a woman out in-person since middle school, and I guess I still haven't, technically, but I left a note for her, asking her out to coffee with my phone number. I know that might not seem like a huge step to some people, but it was for me. I agonized over whether or not to do it for days ahead of time, but I'm glad I did it. If nothing comes of it, oh well. At least I can say I tried, and I put myself out there. (Assuming she didn't throw the note out, thinking it was trash, lol.)",2,1762798012.0,ChristianDating,0,1.0,False

**\*Context:** because of the long distance, he booked a hotel.

Most people see coffee as just roasted beans, but those beans actually come from a *fruit*, the coffee cherry 🍒. Understanding what’s inside gives you a whole new appreciation for how complex and beautiful this plant really is.

Here’s a quick breakdown of the coffee cherry anatomy:

1. **Skin (Exocarp)** \- The thin outer layer, usually bright red or yellow when ripe. It’s slightly bitter and contains antioxidants.
2. **Pulp (Mesocarp)** \- The sweet, sticky part beneath the skin. It’s full of sugars and mucilage - that sticky layer that plays a big role during fermentation.
3. **Mucilage** \-This layer surrounds the beans and is packed with sugars that influence the flavor during processing (especially in honey and natural coffees).
4. **Parchment (Endocarp) -** A thin, papery shell that protects the beans. It’s what gives “parchment coffee” its name when beans are dried with this layer still on.
5. **Silverskin (Perisperm)** \- A delicate, silvery layer that clings to the beans. You might’ve seen it as the chaff that flakes off during roasting.
6. **Beans (Seeds)** \- Usually two per cherry, facing each other flat-side in. These are what we roast, grind, and brew. Sometimes, though, there’s only one seed - called a **peaberry**, which is rounder and often roasted separately.

Next time you sip your cup, remember, each “bean” went through layers of protection and transformation before it reached your mug. 

From fruit to roast, it’s a wild journey 🌱➡️🔥➡️☕

The fog-shrouded streets of Geneva in November 2025 carried a chill that seeped into Dr. Elara Voss’s bones as she hurried toward the Quantum Frontier Institute. The institute’s glass facade reflected the city’s twinkling lights like fractured timelines, a fitting metaphor for her work. Elara, in her mid-30s, moved with the purposeful stride of someone chasing ghosts. Her dark hair was pulled back in a practical ponytail, her face etched with lines from sleepless nights. Born in a serene Oregon coastal town, where her marine biologist father dissected sea creatures on weathered docks and her philosophy professor mother pondered existence under vast skies, Elara had always been drawn to the unseen threads of reality. At MIT, she’d met Marcus, her husband, an engineer whose warm smile and practical optimism balanced her theoretical flights. Their life together had been a harmony of blueprints and equations—until that fateful rainy evening in 2022. Distracted by a sudden insight into retrocausality, she’d glanced at her notes, missing the red light. The crash’s screeching metal and shattering glass still echoed in her nightmares, claiming Marcus and leaving her with a guilt that estranged her from her sister, Lena.
Lena, a passionate artist in Portland, had always lived in Elara’s intellectual shadow. Their childhood was filled with beachcombing adventures, but Lena’s creative spirit clashed with Elara’s logic. After the accident, Lena’s accusations—“You chose your damn theories over him!”—had severed their bond, leaving Elara isolated in Geneva, burying herself in QFI’s labs. There, she built the retro-entangler: a sleek array of quantum coils and holographic interfaces, designed to send “echoes”—subtle, probabilistic nudges backward in time. Grounded in string theory’s compactified dimensions, these echoes avoided paradoxes through self-consistency, verified by unaffectable luck events like sequences from quantum random number generators (QRNGs). No full rewrites, just gentle ripples, like whispers from a future self.
The first echo arrived on a crisp morning in the lab, where the air hummed with the low whine of lasers and carried the faint scent of ozone from heated circuits. Elara was adjusting the dials, her fingers steady despite the tremor of anticipation, when reality flickered—like a glitch in an old film reel. A vivid intuition washed over her: her postdoc colleague, Dr. Mira Chen, slipping on a spilled vial of iridescent chemical that pooled like liquid starlight on the tiled floor. Mira, a determined woman in her late 20s with a sharp mind honed from fleeing Hong Kong’s political turmoil, was mid-sentence about quantum optics, her voice animated and her black hair catching the fluorescent lights. Elara lunged forward, her hand grasping Mira’s arm just as the vial tipped. It shattered with a sharp crack, shards scattering like fallen stars under the harsh glow. Mira’s eyes widened in shock, her breath catching. “Elara? How did you know that was going to happen?” The QRNG verifier on Elara’s screen flashed triumphantly: a perfect match to tomorrow’s random draw. Heart pounding, Elara’s mind raced—a mix of exhilaration and dread. If the accident was prevented, what had prompted the warning in the first place?
Dr. Kai Rivera arrived moments later, his footsteps echoing down the sterile hallway. In his late 30s, with sharp features softened by a perpetual hint of a smile and a casual swagger from his Los Angeles upbringing—where immigrant parents ran a taqueria amid the ceaseless hum of city life—Kai had climbed academia’s ladder through sheer grit. Scholarships to UCLA and Princeton had sharpened his string theory expertise, and he’d navigated personal challenges, including coming out as gay in a conservative field. At QFI, he mentored young scientists from similar backgrounds, his dry wit a balm in tense experiments. “Impressive save,” he said, clapping Elara’s shoulder with a genuine grin that crinkled the corners of his eyes. “String theory’s self-consistency at work? The universe won’t let paradoxes stick.” Elara exhaled, relief flooding her, and explained the echo. Kai’s enthusiasm ignited; he pulled up a chair, his sleeves rolled up, and dove into the data.
Over the next few days, Kai became her steadfast collaborator, transforming the lab into a hive of activity. Surrounded by glowing screens that cast ethereal blue hues on their faces and tangled wires that snaked across the workbench like veins, he ran diagnostics with focused intensity. “Look here,” he said one evening as the sun dipped below the horizon, painting the room in twilight shadows. He pointed to a holographic display where wavering timelines danced like fireflies. “Your echoes are fuzzy—quantum noise from the extra dimensions bleeding through. If we calibrate the compactifications tighter, using my braneworld models, we can sharpen the signals. Make them more precise, less prone to that nagging backlash.” Elara watched, a spark of hope kindling, as Kai’s adjustments stabilized the loops. They tested small echoes: one prevented a minor equipment failure, the verifier glowing green like a beacon. Kai stayed late, brewing strong coffee that filled the air with its bitter aroma, sharing stories of his family’s struggles over steaming mugs. “This could change everything,” he mused, his voice laced with wonder. “Subtle nudges, no big paradoxes—just enough to tip the scales.” Elara smiled, feeling the weight of isolation lift for the first time since Marcus; Kai’s presence was a steady anchor in the swirling uncertainties of her research.
Yet, as the collaboration deepened, Kai found himself alone in the lab one quiet afternoon while Elara met with Mira about a side project. The device sat there, its coils humming softly, an invitation he couldn’t ignore. His mind wandered to his father’s heart attack years ago—a preventable tragedy if only they’d had the resources for better care. “Just a small test,” he whispered to himself, his pulse quickening. He programmed a minor echo: a nudge to his past self about a forgotten scholarship deadline, verified by a luck-based stock fluctuation he couldn’t influence. The air seemed to thicken as the device activated, a faint vibration traveling up his arms. Then, the reality shift hit—subtle, like a dream solidifying. A new memory bloomed: applying on time, easing his family’s burdens with that extra grant money. The rush was electric, a surge of euphoria that left him breathless, his hands trembling on the console. “Incredible,” he breathed, the taste of power lingering like a forbidden fruit. It hooked him instantly, a quiet addiction forming in the recesses of his mind. He rationalized it as harmless calibration, but the craving gnawed at him, promising more.
Weeks later, with the echoes now sharper thanks to Kai’s refinements, news of Elara’s progress reached Victor Hale, the enigmatic CEO of Nexus Dynamics. Victor, in his early 50s with a polished demeanor and steel-gray eyes that seemed to pierce through veils of time, hailed from London’s affluent banking circles. The overlooked second son, he’d been eclipsed by his charismatic brother, Elias. A teenage skiing accident—where an inexplicable “premonition” had averted a deadly avalanche, the snow crunching under his skis as panic gave way to salvation—ignited Victor’s fascination with time’s malleability. At Oxford, studying neuroscience amid the ancient spires and bustling quads, he and Elias had conceptualized retrocausality together. But Elias’s vision was tainted by greed: using echoes for personal luxuries, rigging markets to build destructive empires that could topple economies. Victor, foreseeing the broader peril in quiet nights of calculation, had sent a careful echo to expose Elias’s embezzlement of family funds. The revelation, unfolding in a storm of headlines and family tears, drove Elias to suicide—a haunting scar Victor bore like a necessary wound. Founding Nexus in the aftermath, Victor wielded echoes for a greater purpose: shaping a “good civilization” through precise nudges—averting ecological collapses with whispers to policymakers, accelerating sustainable tech by inspiring inventors, guiding humanity toward equity. Individual lives lost along the way? Mere ripples in the grand wave, though Elias’s memory lingered as a constant ache.
Victor entered Elara’s life unannounced, appearing at her office door one crisp morning with the faint scent of rain on his coat. Tall and composed in a tailored suit that whispered of old money, he extended a hand with a measured smile. “Dr. Voss, your work on retro-entangler echoes is revolutionary. The refinements—those braneworld calibrations—could elevate it further. May we discuss?” Intrigued and wary, Elara led him to the lounge, where rain drummed against the windows like insistent fingers, and the air held the cozy warmth of a fireplace crackling in the corner. Over steaming coffee that fogged the glass tabletop, Victor shared his philosophy with quiet intensity. “I’ve used similar tech at Nexus—careful shaping for global good. But your echoes, now so sharp… they could minimize quantum backlash even more.” Elara listened, her initial suspicion melting as he sketched diagrams on a napkin, his pen moving with precise strokes. “Combine my holographic boundary encodings from AdS/CFT duality with your loops. Echoes become targeted—nudge a policy here, avert a crisis there, all self-consistent, like threads in a vast tapestry.”
Their ideas meshed over subsequent meetings, each one building on the last. In the lab, Victor’s presence was commanding yet collaborative; he rolled up his sleeves, his fingers deft on the controls as they adjusted parameters side by side. “See? Sharper signals mean fewer unintended ripples,” he explained during one marathon session, as a test echo reconciled a minor lab dispute, its verifier glowing green and casting a soft light on their faces. Their relationship evolved beyond the professional—late dinners in Geneva’s cozy bistros, where candlelight danced on wine glasses and the murmur of other patrons provided a soothing backdrop. Victor opened up about Elias over a shared bottle of merlot, his voice low and reflective. “He was brilliant, my brother—full of fire. But his echoes would have doomed us all, sparking famines from greed-driven chaos. I pruned him for the species, though the cost… it lingers.” Elara shared her guilt over Marcus, the words tumbling out in the intimate glow: the rain-slicked road, the final touch of his hand. Victor listened, his steel eyes softening with rare empathy. “You’re not like him,” she said once, their hands brushing across the table. “You sacrifice for others, even if it hardens you.” Victor’s role as anti-hero crystallized: ruthless in his utilitarian vision, yet capable of quiet tenderness, his stoic facade cracking in moments of vulnerability. He became her confidant, a partner in the dance of echoes, their bond a blend of intellectual synergy and mutual healing that tempered his cold pragmatism with her lingering compassion.
With Kai still part of the team, they turned their sharpened echoes to bolder ambitions. One tense afternoon in the simulation chamber, holograms flickering like distant stars, the trio gathered to attempt ending a simmering war in a volatile region—a conflict that had claimed thousands, its roots in a politician’s inflammatory speech years prior. “We nudge the politician,” Victor proposed, his voice steady as he input coordinates. “A subtle echo to alter his words, promoting diplomacy instead. Verified by a luck-based diplomatic cable leak we can’t influence.” Kai nodded, his hands on the controls, while Elara monitored the loops, her brow furrowed in concentration.
The device activated with a deep hum, the air vibrating as the echo launched backward. At first, success seemed near—news feeds shifted subtly, headlines softening from “Escalation Imminent” to “Peace Talks Begin.” But then the backlash hit, harsh and unrelenting. Reality storms erupted: the chamber shook, timelines bleeding into one another like ink in water. Elara gasped as flashbacks assaulted her—alternate pasts where Elias stood beside Victor in the lab, his charismatic laugh echoing, only to fade like a ghost; Marcus appeared in a vision, alive and smiling at a dinner table, then vanished in a crash of light, his absence a fresh wound. Kai clutched his head, murmuring about his father’s revived presence turning to dust. Victor’s face paled, Elias’s suicide replaying in loops. “The echo’s too bold—paradoxes amplifying!” Elara cried over the chaos.
Desperation sparked a solution. “We send an echo to ourselves,” Kai suggested, his voice cutting through the storm. “A nudge back to this moment, correcting the calibration. It’s… personal, like fixing our own loop.” Elara hesitated—it mirrored Kai’s secret uses—but Victor nodded. “Do it. Self-consistency demands it.” They programmed the counter-echo: a whisper to their past selves about a minor adjustment, verified by a random lab sensor reading. The air stabilized as the nudge arrived—reality settling, the war’s end solidified without further backlash. The team exhaled, the chamber quieting, but Elara felt a twinge of unease. “We’re playing with fire,” she murmured. Victor squeezed her hand. “For the greater good.”
Inspired by the success—and the personal echo’s thrill—Kai retreated to his lab that night. The addiction roared back; if they could echo themselves, why not fix his own regrets? He sent a bolder nudge: retroactively averting his father’s death entirely, verified by a luck-based medical record. The shift hit hard—memories of a healthier family flooding in—but it cracked something deeper, his eyes glazing with obsession.
The turning point arrived when Elara discovered anomalies in the system’s logs—subtle discrepancies that pointed to unauthorized uses. In Kai’s private lab, a chaotic den of humming servers and tangled cables bathed in the harsh glow of a single desk lamp, she confronted him one stormy afternoon, rain lashing the windows outside. “Kai, what have you done?” she demanded, her voice trembling with betrayal, holding printouts that fluttered in her hand like accusing leaves. “These logs—personal echoes? For gain? I trusted you—our late nights, your refinements that made this possible!”
Kai froze at his console, his sharp features paling, a bead of sweat tracing his temple in the dim light. He stood slowly, his hands raised in a placating gesture, the scent of overheated electronics mingling with the tension in the air. “Elara, wait—listen. It was just small things, tests to understand the device better. I got carried away, yeah? The rush… it’s like nothing else. But I see now—it’s dangerous. I won’t do it again. Promise. We can fix this together, like before.” His voice softened, eyes meeting hers with feigned remorse, drawing on their shared history to calm her. Elara hesitated, the storm outside mirroring her inner turmoil, her shoulders slumping as exhaustion won. “You swear? No more secrets?” Kai nodded earnestly, pulling her into a brief, awkward hug that smelled of coffee and regret. “Swear. Let’s focus on the big picture—Victor’s vision, your heart. We’re a team.” She relented, the bond of their early collaboration holding, though a seed of doubt lingered like a faint echo.
Reassured, they rejoined Victor for the ambitious project: a major echo to nudge the 2019 pandemic response, sharpening early warnings to save millions. In the vast simulation chamber, holographic displays flickered like ethereal ghosts under high ceilings, the air charged with ozone and anticipation. Elara at the central console, her fingers dancing over controls; Victor nearby, his presence a steady pillar; Kai assisting with simulations, his demeanor subdued but eyes glinting with hidden intent. As the device whirred to life, targeting a whistleblower’s alert with precise, sharpened signals, reality began to bend—memories shifting like sand, the pandemic’s horrors softening in Elara’s mind: shorter lockdowns, faster vaccines, headlines of “Early Warning Saves Millions” flashing vividly. But a cost emerged—a key researcher’s “freak accident” in the new timeline, their imagined scream echoing faintly.
“It worked,” Victor whispered, his face paling under the blue holographic glow, a hand resting on Elara’s shoulder. “The species thrives… but that life—gone.”
Elara nodded, a knot in her throat. “We changed time as we know it. For the greater good?”
Kai, at his station, saw his chance amid the distraction. The addiction surged; he couldn’t resist. “One last nudge,” he murmured, overriding a subroutine for his own selfish echo—a massive retroactive windfall, verified by a luck-based market swing. The device protested with a low groan, but he pressed on.
Suddenly, the chamber trembled. “Echo storms” erupted—reality warping in violent waves, alternate memories clashing like thunder: pandemics raging unchecked in one vision, fortunes crumbling in another. Flashbacks intensified—Elias reappearing in vivid scenes, laughing with Victor at Oxford, then dissolving; Marcus materializing in Elara’s arms at a beach picnic, only to fade in a swirl of rain and regret. Alarms blared, red lights pulsing like heartbeats. “Kai, what did you do?” Elara shouted over the din, her voice raw as holographic timelines fractured around them.
Kai sneered amid the chaos, his facade crumbling. “Beyond myself? Like Victor sacrificing Elias? Hypocrites! This power—it’s mine now. One blast, and I rewrite it all for me!”
Victor stepped forward, voice calm yet edged with steel. “Elias had to go. His destruction would have echoed famine, war. One life for billions. Kai, you’re the same poison. Elara—prune him. Send the counter-echo. Species over self.”
Elara’s fingers trembled on the controls, sweat beading on her forehead, the metallic tang of fear sharp in her mouth. “Prune? He’s a person, Victor—not a variable! Mira’s life, Lena’s forgiveness—they matter. If we kill for the ‘greater good,’ what’s left of us?”
“Everything,” Victor urged, his hand steadying hers. “A world without regret’s chains. But choose now—the loop closes.”
Kai lunged toward his console, activating his override with a defiant roar. “Too late!”
The explosion erupted—a blinding flash that tore through the chamber, time folding backward in a vortex of light and deafening sound. Debris flew in reverse, echoes rippling like shattering waves across the room. Flames licked the air, then rewound in impossible loops, the blast’s effects cascading into yesterday, warping the lab’s very foundations. Elara shielded her eyes, glimpsing Kai’s silhouette amid the maelstrom—his form dissolving in one fractured instant, yet persisting in another shadow of possibility, flashbacks intertwining: Elias and Marcus flickering in and out, existing then disappearing in the chaos.
In the aftermath, Elara staggered out with Victor, the device scarred and smoking in her arms, the air thick with acrid smoke and unresolved tension. They collapsed in the lounge, rain still pattering outside, the city lights a blurred comfort. “Kai… is he gone?” Elara whispered, her voice hoarse, images of the explosion replaying—his scream cut short, or was it? Victor shook his head, his face drawn. “The storms obscure it. Perhaps pruned… or echoed away. We may never know.”
Years later, in a future timeline where echoes had woven a fragile peace, an older Elara sat with Victor in a sunlit study, their hands intertwined, the weight of choices etched in their eyes. The retro-entangler, refined further, hummed on the desk. “One minor correction,” future Elara murmured, programming a subtle nudge back to that fateful day—a whisper to temper Kai’s final lunge, ensuring the loop’s consistency without full erasure. The echo sent, reality shimmered faintly, a ripple smoothing the past’s jagged edges—flashbacks stabilizing, Elias and Marcus’s ghosts fading into what-ifs.
The story closed with ambiguity: In one vision, Kai’s ashes scattered amid the ruins; in another, he emerged scarred but alive, branching into shadows of redemption or ruin. Only then did a final echo whisper from the ether: “In many worlds, every choice branches—paradoxes dissolve in infinity, leaving us to wonder which path we walk.”
The loops closed, but the moral rift—and Kai’s fate—endured, echoing forever in the multiverse’s vast expanse.",1,1762797600.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

I think I’ve been unconsciously affirming that my SP is obsessed with me, and it’s scaring me. For days I’ve been affirming “SP talks to me every day” and “SP is in love with me,” but before that, I *was* affirming that he was obsessed with me. It scared me, so I changed it to “he’s in love with me.” But unconsciously, I’ve realized that the phrase “he’s obsessed” has been coming and going while I was affirming robotically (including the two above).

And today, my mind has been bombarding me nonstop with the idea that he’s obsessed with me and not in a “deeply in love” kind of way, but like a stalker. It even gave me anxiety to go out for a walk alone. My affirmations are still “he talks to me every day” and “he’s in love with me,” but I don’t understand how, just because I said “he’s obsessed with me” twice in a row, my mind keeps repeating that so strongly now.

I don’t want a stalker I know what that’s like, and it terrifies me. It also scares me that my SP knows where I live, knows everything, even what time I have my coffee. (I told him all that before, but now I see it with fear and zero romantic feeling.)

  
I keep repeating my affirmations in a loop  “He’s in love with me,” “He talks to me every day” but even so, my mind keeps adding “And he’s obsessed with you,” “He’s kind of obsessed.” I do it involuntarily; they’re like intrusive thoughts.",1,1762797337.0,manifestation_support,0,1.0,False
1otkrk1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskTeenAdvice/comments/1otkrk1/stuck_in_a_very_painful_position_m20_currently_in/,Stuck in a very painful position. M20 currently in 2nd yr of college,"This is a bit of a long story, spanning over a year so please bear with me. Let me first give a prelude to the case. There are four people involved in this; me, my gf, my classmate (MJ) and my roommate (dave). The names are just placeholders so i dont have to type as much.

When i first came to college, i started liking my classmate. I liked her for a while and told my friends and roommate abt this. Turns out she had a bf and they were in a LDR. I was considerably bummed out but accepted it none the less and thought i should move on from her. Me and my roommate went for ice cream the day i decided to move on. Some time later i got into a relationship with my gf who is mj's friend. So mj and one other friend of ours became my ""wingmen"". Me and my gf were really quick to jump into a relationship because we clicked instantly. At this point the fact that i liked mj hadnt left my mind but i was genuinely trying to get over it. As me and my gf got closer, our friend group developed; me, my gf, mj, one other friend and dave. We went out for coffee almost every evening. Also used to go on outings a lot as a group. Me and my gf had gotten physically intimate over the months. One day when we were all gonna go out for dinner, mj had visibly just cried and everyone was asking if she was okay. My gf later told me that she broke up with her bf. I felt a little relieved like i had held my breath for a long time and let go. I knew i was wrong to feel like this as i was committed to my gf. MJ was sad for a long time but she was slowly moving on. A month or so later, the guys went out drinking. Dave and i had a lot to drink but i puked so i had sobered up quiet a bit. Dave drunk texted my gf that he likes mj. He hadnt told anyone that except her. She told me after a while that he liked mj. I was indifferent to the fact and didnt speak to him abt it. Recently both of us got drunk and he asked me if he should do anything abt how he feels, i said its too soon for her and she hasnt recovered from her breakup yet and things would get a little awkward among the friend group. So we listened to some radiohead, said it is what it is and called it a night.

As of a week ago, my gf told me that she had something to tell me abt mj and dave. She told me that mj had started liking dave. I suddenly felt very hopeless, like this bleak feeling started to build in my stomach. My gf asked me if i was happy or excited to hear it. I tried a lot to hide the fact that i felt very down. I blamed it on our end semester exam coming up. Dave and mj started texting and everytime i see dave texting her on his bed my stomach churns and my limbs go limp. Whenever i am reminded of the fact that she likes him back i get so sad. I keep thinking of breaking up with my gf, but i know that its just a desperate attempt to prove to myself that i can do something abt this. My gf loves me a lot and i dont want to disappoint her. I keep thinking back on the time i spent with her and how all of it will just disappear in a second. I dont even know what reason i would give to her for breaking up with her because everything was going perfect in our relationship. MJ is the coolest and the most attractive person ive ever met and since my first sem i used to try to get her to think im cool and get her attention. I had just gotten past liking her and we are really good friends now.

I feel like im being crushed between two feelings. I know i have to endure pain but i cant look into my gfs eyes knowing that i yearn for someone else's love. Leaving her would be devastating for her.

I came here looking for some advice and also because i really needed to tell someone abt this but i feel like there's no one i can tell without being judged. The people closest to me, who i can go to with a problem are involved in this story. I feel defeated.",1,1762797323.0,AskTeenAdvice,1,1.0,False

1otkqav,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1otkqav/rubato_or_the_rum_barrel_drum/,"Rubato, or The Rum Barrel Drum","Bog Tower was a sour town. Even those who lived there said so; trapped between the warped floorboards and the decaying ceilings upon which black mold formed creeping amorphous tapestries. In every dialect, from French to German, Swahili to sign language, the consensus was the same. With the veritable melting pot of cultures converging within the province, most bulldog politicians would grin and call it a utopia. On paper, they would be correct. Despite what you read currently, however, Bog Tower existed far beyond the bounds of ink and page.

People who knew nothing else about Bog Tower knew about the rain. Since its founding, the town was plagued by thunderstorms. Severe and constant. As if something had decided the town should not exist. To combat the flooding, storm drains were installed along every cobbled street, constructed much wider and longer than regulation drains. 

While they initially served their purpose, the rain and flooding soon proved itself more powerful than anything man could craft. Soon, the drains fell to corrosion and buildup of filth and plaque. Once the drains were destroyed, the rain poured with twofold the power it had before. With no time to devise an alternative plan, citizens were forced to abandon the drains, build new homes and businesses upon the flooded ones, and treat the streets as canals. Treasured motorcars, carriages, and bicycles became canoes and wide fishing boats. Still, the rain did not stop, and the second layer of the town proved to be worryingly temporary.

So persisted the cycle of flooding and rebuilding that the current city of Bog Tower sat upon miles of drowned, decayed structures. Beneath the waters of the schoolhouse were the remains of pubs and lunatic asylums. The village church rested upon an old brothel. Even the town inn, The Liar’s Tongue, sat upon the charred remnants of the old orphanage (one of few buildings in Bog Tower’s history to meet the cruelly ironic fate of burning to a cinder before being submerged).  It was at this iteration of Bog Tower that the small skiff carrying Oswald Peng first split its murky waters. 
 
Peng arrived on one of the few nights when pounding rain did not upset the canals. A fog held its place, the air heavy with humidity thick as cobwebs. In the murky distance, two or three cloaked figures rowed similar skiffs along the twisting tributaries branching off the main canal. What awaited down those narrow alleys appeared to the layman as nothing but hollow darkness.

 Oswald’s leg bounced steadily against the bottom of the boat, sending dull knocks echoing against the sweating window panes and acid washed brick of the surrounding buildings. Cautiously peering over the edge of the boat, the monolithic ghosts of different Bog Towers were barely visible against the muted twilight.  The ferryman rowed his skiff ever closer to the inn, passing a lopsided clocktower with sagging stone gargoyles. An orange glow cast canine shadows across the stone face of a gargoyle Oswald had fixated on, and he pried his eyes towards its source.

In the distance, the lights of what appeared to be a boarding house emanated over the cold waters. On the ground level of the building (or at least the lowest level above water), A wide mouth lined with brick teeth yawned above the rickety dock. Against the smoggy sky the weathered building took on the visage of a giant corpse’s head. Oswald jumped as a piece of wood splashed to the surface, jostled free from some long-forgotten structure by the current. The bargeman chuckled, and Oswald joined him hesitantly. 

“Your stop, sir!” Oswald snatched up his brown leather briefcase before disembarking the skiff. 

“How much for the ride?” 

“The ride is free, sir. '' The bargeman smiled. Oswald nodded tacitly and returned his gaze to the jack-o-lantern glow of The Liar’s Tongue. The giant corpse’s mouth agape. Its splintering tongue stretched out under Oswald’s feet . He took two steps across the dock and stopped. Feeling his pockets frantically for the shape of his wire-rimmed bifocals, Oswald turned back towards the bargeman. “Wait!” he yelled.
 
But the boat and its lone crewmate had already vanished, swallowed by the dense curtain of mist. 

“Shit…” Oswald buttoned his threadbare blazer as he climbed the stairs to the inn. Above him on an upstairs window sill, a small handful of wildflowers wilted in pot soil saturated by rainwater.  

While he expected a break from the dense air outside, The air within the tavern offered little refuge. Twenty tables in total filled shallow alcoves along the tavern’s perimeter, spaced between iron torches. From each alcove wafted the sweet yet crisp scent of imported tobacco, which perfumed the air to its own (much drier)saturation. Oswald found the room comparable to an opium den he once visited in his early adulthood. Comparable... save for the patrons’ eyes. 

Behind thin scrims of parchmentine smoke, fully alert eyes followed Oswald to the bar like those of an Oracle Panther waiting to strike. Keeping his eyes affixed to the ebony wood and brass rivets of the bar, he gingerly sat himself on one of the aged stools.

 “Do you have any coffee?” Oswald muttered though he felt as though he was not consciously forming the words. The barmaid, a woman of about sixty, stared at him with steely blue eyes that shrank his heart like a raisin. 

“I know why you’re here.”

If there was anything Oswald had expected the stony barmaid to say, it certainly was not that. Once again Oswald’s mouth began attempting to conjure words, but his brain halted them in his throat. What escaped his lips was a dull croak. The barmaid placed the heavy glass stein she had been polishing on the bar with a staccato clunk. 

“Trust me, lad. We all come here for the same reason. There’s only one thing that’s always different.”

Placing two callused elbows beside the frosted glass mug, she leaned in to meet Oswald’s eyes once again, her head propped on her fists.

“So what is it you’re running from?”




Rain pattered on his office window, reflecting phantom droplets onto the stacks of papers surrounding his desk. Oswald paid no mind to them, as the one in front of him was his main focus. Everything he read made him grin wider. Uncapping his pen, he scribbled his signature next to the large X at the bottom.


“You’ll give yourself arthritis if you keep doing that, you know.”


Oswald turned around to see the barmaid, silhouetted by candlelight in the doorway of his rented room. He looked down and realized he’d been cracking his knuckles. Instead of responding, he chuckled lightly. 

“Here are some extra matches for the candle” She tossed Oswald a worn matchbook with two matches missing from it. Inscribed on the front cover was a sketch of the Bog Clock Tower. 

“Thank you,” Oswald said, placing it on the nightstand beside the bed. The barmaid bid Oswald goodnight and began pulling the creaking wooden door closed. 

“Don’t feel as though you have to tell me what you’ve run away from.” Her whisper was almost motherly, and Oswald felt his shoulders instinctively relax.

“ We all find out sooner or later.” And she was gone. 



Twixt the obelisks of moral thinking and beastly intentions, the Fates gathered by candlelight. Their cloaks fluttered against the wind, black as space and ominous as things to come. They placed a single thread between the three of them, clean and silken as a virgin’s skin. This thread had yet to see hardship or corruption and shone as brightly as the day it was conceived. With tongues laden with blisters and boils, lips cracked and blackened by centuries of speaking vile truths they chanted burning curses In accents seldom heard by human ears.
 


“Isss it awake?” A voice cooed, as if from a dream. 
Oswald’s eyes shot open, and for a moment he lay completely still, debating if he had in fact dreamed it. Light footsteps from the hallway caused Oswald to turn his head to the door of the room.

 “Ahhhhhh…”
 
The door creaked open slowly, and Oswald was greeted with the form of a boy, no more than 10 years old. As the child entered the room on feet that glowed like moonbeams, Oswald noticed the intricate crown perched on its head. Crafted from a mixture of sculpted metal and animal bone, a large teardrop emerald shone bright at its center. 
“So it isss awaaake.”

 Oswald found himself sitting up against the headboard in a feeble attempt to escape the ghostly figure. 

“Get away!” The ghost did not respond but instead sat down on Oswald's bed. 

“Whaaaat is itssss name?” the ghost’s milky eyes saw Oswald without looking at him. Shaking, he responded 

“O-Oswald.”

“Ahhhhhh…” The boy’s sigh sounded amused. 

“What is your name?” The ghost smiled at Oswald’s question 

“Don’t…knoooow” Oswald’s face dropped from frightened to confused. 

“You don’t know your own name?” 

“Don’t rememmmmber… know that it was given to me before the kingdom fell.” There was a long silence, and Oswald found that he could not make eye contact with the specter. He felt that if he were to look into its empty eyes, he might go mad with guilt. It finally broke the silence.
 “How many did you kill?” Oswald flinched at the question. 

“What do you mean?” 

“Mosssst who come here have come because they are killerssss…”

 “Well I am not one of them. '' The child tilted its head. Oswald swallowed deeply. This child’s blind eyes saw more than he ever hoped to give away.

 “Who did you kill?”  Oswald muttered, his voice devoid of any power. 

“ Killed my mmmmother when I was bornnnn… then killed my father once I was old enough to draw a sswordd…” Oswald and the ghost sat in silence for a while. Outside, a light rain had started pattering against the windows. Finally the ghost spoke. 

“Do you regrrret whhhat you’ve done?”

 “Why?” Oswald asked. 

“There is a way… To return.” Oswald’s eyes lit up. 

“What do you mean, ‘return’?”

The child rose and walked towards the door. Its glowing form began to fade.

 “Reverse the sands of time… undo your wrongs…” 

It was no more than a face hovering in the darkness. 

“Beat the drum…”


Oswald awoke with a start, though his preceding sleep was remarkably calm. Gathering himself and slowing his breathing, Oswald investigated each corner of the room, now lit in the overcast grey of what constituted daylight in Bog Tower. In the light emanating from the rain-drenched windows, no sign of a ghostly child could be found. A dream, then. Rising from the creaky bed and quickly dressing himself, he vaguely smelled something burning.


The motherly barmaid had disappeared from behind the bar, replaced with a stout, squirrely-looking man with a nose turned bright crimson by years of strong drink. Hoping to set himself down a similar path, Oswald sat on the same stool he had the previous night. 

“Anything I can fetch you, sir?” The man said, flashing a smile from a mouth of white, straight teeth.

 “A drink.”

“Any drink?”

 “Something to calm a troubled mind.” A moment passed, then a glass half full of clear liquid slid in front of Oswald, who swiftly emptied its fiery contents.

 “What is it that troubles you, my thirsty friend?” His glass was once again filled. 

“Nothing really, just… a bad dream.” 

The man said nothing, but his smile widened. “Those tend to be commonplace around here. After a while they all sort of…blend together.” 

As the liquor once again passed his lips, Oswald eyed the collection of artifacts hanging just above the walls of the bar, resting upon the dusty wooden lip which separated the stone bar walls from the dark rafters. the skull of an Oracle Panther gazed down at him, its full tusks poking over the edge of the shelf. An instrument that resembled a telescope sat beside it, with the extendable body replaced with a spotted brass globe, a gilded planet encircled by two rings. His gaze passed daggers, scrolls, bottles housing unnatural and indistinct masses.

 Oswald’s breath caught in his throat, and he felt his stomach sink like so many anchors that dropped every day along the Bog Tower canals. As thunder rumbled from outside the bar, he recognized the shape of a crown, constructed of animal bone and twisted metal, with a bright emerald at its center. Leaning against it.

Was a drum.

The virgin thread, now a sickly gray, was held taut between the aged claws of the Fates. In another of their talons, A pair of shears, rusted from eons of galactic weather and the dripping of liquid evil which seeped from their flesh like water through the boards of a sinking ship. Though they cut thousands of cords every earthly minute, they gained no small amount of pleasure from the thought of cutting this one. It was a thread of learned and deliberate evil. The shears closed on the string.

It did not split though

Something happened that even the omnipotent Fates could never foresee. As the witches watched in feral confusion, the thread began to expand, branching and creeping like the roots of some vast, unnatural tree. 


“The wood has never been identified,” the man with the white teeth said, tilting the drum to show off the barrel which made up its shell. “It originally came to us from a distant place.” 

“How distant?” 

“No one knows for sure. In fact, we don’t even know who delivered it. It had been stuck in among our other casks and no one paid any mind to it.” Oswald attempted to examine the drum. He wished he had his bifocals.

 “Here” the bartender handed him a small magnifying glass. “Take a closer look.”

As Oswald held the glass before the drum, he suddenly realized that the wood it was composed of was not nearly as dark as he had initially assumed. From a distance, the drum appeared to be fashioned from dark gray, ashen wood. Upon closer inspection, however, the wood was actually a yellowish-white, not unlike that of a birch tree. 

What gave the barrel drum its dark complexion were the vast and intricate carvings that lined it. Some extensive and gaudy, some simple and ritualistic, all measured only a centimeter or two thick. Even so, nearly every inch of the drum was covered in these esoteric glyphs. 

“Have you any idea what these markings mean?” Oswald asked. The man chuckled. 

“You overestimate my knowledge as a simple barman, my friend.” 

“Truly, it is a masterpiece” 

“That it is.” The bartender raised the drum over his shoulder and began to return it to its spot in the rafters. That was when the words of the phantom child rang loud against the back of his skull.

 “Beat the drum”

“Wait!” Oswald called out after the bartender, who turned with an expression that might have been delight. The air flexed as Oswald reached out and touched the drum.

The air was thin, and Oswald struggled to suck it into his heaving lungs. How could he have ever known it would come to this? He buried his head in his hands and slumped back against his office door. Outside that door, panicked yelling and muffled sobs. So many lost in an instant. And Oswald knew exactly why.

“Strike it hard, right here” The bartender pointed to the very center of the skin head of the drum. Oswald nodded. 

“Are you sure this will work?” The bartender said nothing, but stepped back, far away from Oswald and the ethereal drum. Oswald raised his hand. With the air once again swelling and vibrating around him, he struck. 

A dark sea engulfed him, thicker than water. No light penetrated this void, yet an electric blizzard of white bubbles and specks swirled around Oswald, an entire sky of shooting stars. The only sound, sharp and deafening, was the beating of the drum. What had started as a simple strike had evolved into an intricate cadence Oswald knew he was not capable of playing. He watched his hands strike down in a frenzy upon the barrel-drum’s head. Paradiddles, polyrhythms, crescendo, diminuendo, faster, faster, faster

Stop.

Oswald was breathing heavily, and raising a hand to his brow realized he was sweating. Flecks of light danced in the corners of his vision. He raised his head and realized exactly where the drum had brought him. He sat in a dark, yet strikingly clean corridor, which opened behind him into a sprawling office space. In front of him, light spilled from the window of one door. In stenciled gold letters upon this door:

Oswald Peng
Operations Director 
Driskol & Floute Mining Company 

He tried the knob and found it unlocked. Without hesitation, he gently pushed the door open.

Rain pattered on the office window, and the lamp attached to the ceiling fan cast yellow light onto the stacks of paper surrounding his desk. Oswald scanned the stacks, searching for one paper. The one. That very wretched document that had brought him to Bog Tower, to the Liar’s Tongue, to the drum. 

He spotted it. Sitting in the center of his desk, the bottom line clean and unsigned. Oswald let out a small, triumphant laugh, as he raised it to his eye level. With the liberating frenzy of tears, the document lay shredded on the deep green carpet. Oswald could finally breathe. He had liberated himself from his personal hell. He had stopped any accountability before it had the chance to start. He was safe. Now there would be no mine explosion. No flurry of lawsuits. No protest. No bankruptcy. No consequences. Relieved, Oswald sat down in his desk chair and took a moment to gaze out at the dark, stormy sky…

It hadn’t been nighttime when he signed the document. Why was it dark now? Why were his office lights on? Dread slowly closed Oswald’s throat once again. This wasn’t right. Somehow this cursed drum had sent him to a time and place in which he had never lived, and would never have lived. Whatever course of events he had just altered, it was not his own. Before Oswald knew it he was throwing open the office door he had thought was his, and running down the hallway back to the drum. Wrenching it up into his arms, he struck it once again.

Another flurry of rudiments cast into the engulfing void, and Oswald found himself once again running towards his office door. Inside, rain pattered against the windows, reflecting phantom droplets onto the piles of paper surrounding his desk. He had no time to take notice, however. Picking up the document from the correct desk, at the correct time, in the correct place, Oswald placed the document in his back pocket. Considering it was the same document, all he need do is place this fresh version in place of the torn one and all would be well. Confidently, he reached out to grab the drum. Oswald missed entirely, merely rapping his knuckles against the rim. He panicked as he watched the drum topple onto its side with a muffled boom.

Oswald and the drum stood in a pitch-black corridor. Reaching out, Oswald felt that the walls of this corridor were fashioned of stone. Beneath his feet he felt similar stone. This was not right. Oswald’s fingers moved from stone to thick fabric along the wall. A tapestry? Was this some sort of castle? A light came from under a door at one end of the hallway. Oswald snatched up the drum and prepared to hide, holding his breath. The door never opened. Instead, a feeble scream came from behind the door. The sound of metal hitting stone. A deep sound like a piece of furniture being knocked over. Another scream, cut off. Silence. Oswald gathered what little nerve he had left and frantically struck the drum.

 The morning sun peeked through his office windows. Not right either . Racking his brain, Oswald remembered that he had struck the drum precisely on its eastmost rim when he was sent to the first office. He breathed deeply and felt his hand strike precisely the same place in the exact same manner. 

The void gave way one final time, and Oswald placed the fresh document on his own desk for the last time. Finally well and fully relieved, he pulled open his office door.

The drum was gone.

At that exact moment, audible across multiple universes, causing the very Fates to shudder with a bastardization of fear, a growl like the implosion of a dwarf star. 

For you see, Oswald’s tampering with the very fate that had doomed him had awoken something no mortal man could face 

In the void, a massive shape stirred.

The wall of Oswald’s office building exploded, crumbling out into the emptiness of space.

Before Oswald, the form of a massive spectral dog appeared, shrouded by the trails of comets and as massive as three suns placed lengthwise. Oswald felt its eyes, nothing more than two piercingly bright stars, shining horrible beams of pale light through every inch of his body, gripping his brain like a child gripping a wet sponge. He nearly convulsed and fell on his knees before the ethereal hellhound. 

In his brain, words appeared as though written on a chalkboard, spoken without a voice.

“ You do not belong here.”

Oswald was paralyzed, no part of his body functioning anymore. His nerve endings burned like kerosene-soaked rope. 

No more words came to him, but looking into these creature’s eyes, one feeling saturated every pore of his skin and vibrated a deep baritone in the joints between his bones 

Hunger 

The Hellhound was hungry, and it had come to feed on this universe. A universe no human would ever see. A universe born through decision.

Oswald collapsed, and every cell in his body separated. Every element of him was torn apart and hurled back into the void. Proteins, bacteria, paramecia, genes, all erased in an instant.

The Hellhound feasted on the flesh of the world left behind. A world born of choices never meant to be chosen. 

The fates returned to hiding, sheltered by the words of fiction and mythology.  
Somewhere, tucked away in a decrepit town brought about by the powers of regret; forgot by all but those who wish to be forgotten. 

In the rafters, among powerful and mysterious objects imbued with the power of mortal mistakes. 

The Rum Barrel drum, the instrument of toppled kingdoms and the bane of broken men, waited, Silent.

Patient.

So my neighbor asked me why I was using a leaf blower to clean my driveway when I could just use the garden hose. Fair question, right? I used to think the same thing until I actually tested both methods.

Here's what I found out. A garden hose works great if you're dealing with wet leaves or mud. The water pressure pushes everything away and you get a clean surface. But here's the problem – you're using a ton of water, everything stays wet for hours, and if you have a lot of leaves, you're basically just moving soggy clumps around. Plus, good luck trying to blow leaves off your lawn with a hose. You'll just end up with a muddy mess.

Now, a leaf blower is a different story. I can clear my entire yard in like fifteen minutes. Dry leaves, grass clippings, dirt, small debris – everything just moves where I want it to go. No water waste, no waiting for things to dry, and I can actually reach under bushes and tight corners without getting soaked.

The real game-changer is when you're dealing with large areas. My backyard is pretty big, and using a garden hose would take forever. With my leaf blower, I'm done before my coffee gets cold. You can check out some solid options here: https://athomewave.com/leaf-blower

Don't get me wrong, I still use my garden hose for certain jobs. If I'm cleaning my patio furniture or washing away actual dirt stains, the hose is perfect. But for regular yard maintenance and clearing leaves? The leaf blower wins every time.

Here's my honest recommendation: if you're just cleaning a small porch or dealing with wet debris, save your money and stick with the hose. But if you've got a yard with trees, grass to maintain, or you're tired of spending your whole Saturday doing yard work, invest in a decent leaf blower. Your back will thank you, and you'll wonder why you didn't get one sooner.

I spent way too long researching different models and features before I finally pulled the trigger. If you want to skip the headache and see what actually works, this page has some reliable options: https://athomewave.com/leaf-blower

Bottom line: both tools have their place, but they're not really competing for the same job. One moves water, the other moves air. For most yard work, the leaf blower is just more practical and efficient.",1,1762796961.0,productlect,0,1.0,False
1otkkuw,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1otkkuw/whats_the_hardest_part_about_leaving/,Whats the hardest part about leaving?,"I was off and on again raised in the church. Got married to a RM, soon after marriage we went inactive. We were inactive until we had our first kid. Started going and paying tithe to get sealed. I kept going, took our kid. We had another kid. Kept going. 
I woke up one day and realized church was so important to him, yet I was the one going since we were sealed. He wouldnt because ""work is so draining"". 
I left him over other reasons but that was somewhat included. 
Actually as I write this I realized almost exactly 2 years ago I told him I was done and wanted a divorce. 

I sin. I have sex with my now boyfriend. I drink alcohol and coffee. 
Yet I still feel a pull to the church. When Im in my darkest moments, the temple grounds is my first thought to go. I have a rough day, and I want to go sit in the church building, I had that yesterday thought about going and didnt then also got a text from the RS president wanting to meet... I want to go sit in the celestial room. Im crying. I am so conflicted. 
The church is... weird. 
I went to a primary program the other day where my 5 year old was reciting how she knows the gospel is true and loves Jesus... I got the big ICK. My 5 year old doesn't know the gospel is true. She is spoon fed informed and told what to say. 
I used to be a HUGE apologetic. And I saw that and realized how that looks like brainwashing, how all those I used to argue with held seeds of truth. 

Though I know the gospel and see seeds of truth. Things that make sense to me that other religions dont believe, but make total and complete sense.
I know I can have a relationship to God without a church. I just absolutely crave the temple. It feels like my safe place. Where I feel closest to God. 

I dont know where to go with this. No offense, but Reddit is full of negative people. I am an overwhelming positive person. I know posting here I won't find anything other than people who will justify me staying away. Maybe an active member will stumble on this and give me reasons to come back. I wouldnt be surprised if I ex or even my boyfriend saw this and knows its me. My ex is a huge deterrent to me going as we're in the same ward. I dont want to deal with him or his mother. 

My boyfriend is very anti- organized religion. I dont think talking about it to him will go anywhere. People in my life are either all for the church or all against it. My mother cries when I bring it up, talking about how its evil. 

I just needed to vent maybe? Am I alone? Craving the temple, the gospel? Not wanting to deal with the church? I cant deny the feeling of feeling so close to God, but the church gives me ICK? 

Reading over this- I feel stupid. I give myself the ICK I just barfed all over this post no real direction, but its my truth. Its what is in my heart. ",2,1762796925.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False
1otkjwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransferStudents/comments/1otkjwj/transferring_to_haas_as_a_bay_area_native/,Transferring to Haas as a Bay Area Native.,"I’m 28 and decided to go back to school wanting just an AA in finance or accounting from my local CC to be a better employee. I work at a manufacturing facility (bottler/distribution for a large beverage company) full time, started in warehouse procurement and shuffled around up to accounts payable. I’ve held every retail position imaginable from Store Manager, to procurement. I was persuaded by my 18 year old self to try Cal again. Big joke? Maybe. It has worked in encouraging me to give it all I got. I consider myself a high school burn out. I took only APs since my sophomore year of high school, was hit hard with senioritis and divorcing parents and ended high school with a unweighted 3.4, stayed home with my mom to help pick herself up, and never got the roll of things in CC. Dropped and failed a lot of classes, started working 2 jobs to compensate for the over spending and told myself college isn’t for me. 6 years later, I found an interest in accounting, and supply chain management, and all the aspects of manufacturing. I’m finally comfortable enough to go back to school and I paced myself to know I can’t do more than 10 units a semester and work full time.I’ve done 3 semesters so far - 24 units and I haven’t had a grade lower than a B. That’s all it took apparently for 18 year old me to say “We can try again.”

I’ve retaken the classes I’ve failed before and I’m still 28 ish units from being able to transfers, but the truth is, I can’t take extra curriculars. I work during most of them, and the idea of starting my own “Accounting Club” or whatever scares me. I help my mom and her friends with their books once a year and that’s it. Even if I stretch it out as “Helped low income single moms with taxes” I feel like it’s bullsit since we get coffee and pan dulce and frankly it doesn’t feel like a real extra curricular. 

Also, honestly, I don want to take calculus again. My local state school is okay with the lowest “Business math” placement and I have it done. Cal would require me to take 2 more math class to fulfill the sequence to reach calculus 1. I know 2 more As or Bs (hopefully) would boost my GPA, but I’m just really scared I’ll lose steam. While it’s not a main requirement, it would make me more competitive to take calculus. I’m already proud of myself. I’ve gone from not wanting to go to school, to going back for an AA, to wanting to transfer to a state. My first goal was CSUEB for Accounting, but after giving it much thought, my main goal is SJSU for Bus Admin/MIS. 
So grade me fairly, as my GPA is 3.0 And maybe if you guys can recommend things that I can do to that will fulfill that “Extracurricular” would my job be enough?

Great casino, free drinks while playing, cocktail waitresses always circulating. Poker room is very popular and smoke free.

Great dining options, $17 breakfast buffet M-F if you join the players club(free), Coronado is good value too. $1.50 hot dogs during the day.

Bowling Alley, Movie theaters for something else to do, saw Abba tribute act in the showroom.

It is a fair way from the Strip but the 117 bus picks up from just outside the valet, change to the Deuce at Town Square. Took 90 minutes to get to Fremont, cost $4 each. $20-30 for Uber to NYNY/MGM area.

Unless you absolutely want to be in the middle of the action on the Strip, you can't do better than Southpoint IMHO.",16,1762796510.0,LasVegas,4,1.0,False

Not gonna lie, definitely took the wind out our sails - we were hoping to score a bit higher, but we’re glad to get feedback as it’s what we wanted. After reflecting a bit (and conferring with Helm Coffee) we were able to pin point why: Even though we usually roast SL28 on the medium side, we think we took it too medium for the higher brackets, as most yeast inoculated coffees taste the same when developed longer, and we should’ve sent our Sidra in which was considerably lighter. 

Our sl28 is amazing though, I prefer it how we roasted it compared to the light profiles we cupped, and based on their grading system it’s not a bad score at all -  we definitely aren’t complaining - but when JBC scored a 98 earlier this month, a 93 seems like a “sufficiently roasted” score lol. Most roasters we talked with about it said we should be stoked, especially for a first time score, but I wanted to know: from a consumer point of view, what are your thoughts on seeing a 93? First impressions? Should we even bother advertising it on IG? Should we bother posting a story about it? Or would this be some negative marketing? TIA

I just read tech news with my coffee because I'm a nerd like that. But something fundamentally different happened between November 4-10 and I genuinely think we crossed a line that we can't uncross.

This isn't hype or doomer shit. This is seven days of stuff that individually would've been massive news, but they all dropped at once and I feel like I'm going insane because nobody's connecting the dots.

**A dictionary just officially declared that human programmers are optional**

Collins Dictionary made ""vibe coding"" their Word of the Year 2025. Not as a joke. As their actual official selection.

What's vibe coding? You tell AI what you want and it writes the code. No programming knowledge required. No typing code yourself.

Y Combinator just revealed that 25% of their current startup batch uses AI to write 95% or more of their code. Not most of it. Ninety-five percent.

Lovable (a vibe coding startup) hit $1.8 billion valuation in under a year with less than 50 employees. Replit's revenue jumped from $2.8 million to $150 million in 12 months.

The entire Y Combinator Winter 2025 batch is growing 10% week over week. Not individual companies. The entire batch.

If a quarter of startups need almost zero human coders, what happens to the people who spent four years getting CS degrees?

**The richest company on Earth just admitted it can't compete**

Apple spent two years trying to build their own AI assistant. They tested everything. Then they gave up and signed a $1 billion annual deal with Google to license Gemini for Siri.

Apple. The company that builds everything in-house. The company with functionally unlimited money. They couldn't do it.

They've delayed their own AI assistant five times now. It was supposed to launch with iPhone 16. Then spring 2025. Then May 2025. Now spring 2026.

The richest tech company on Earth just publicly admitted defeat and is renting AI from a competitor.

**An AI got perfect scores on Harvard and MIT math competitions**

Alibaba's Qwen3-Max-Thinking scored 100% on AIME 2025 and HMMT. Perfect scores on competitions designed to break genius-level mathematicians.

It's live right now. You can test it today through their API.

This should be massive news but it's getting buried under everything else, which tells you how insane this week was.

**A robot moved so naturally they had to unzip its skin to prove it was real**

XPeng unveiled their IRON humanoid robot at their AI Day event. I watched the video expecting typical robot movements.

It moved so naturally that people accused them of faking it with a human in a suit. The CEO had to physically unzip the synthetic skin on stage to prove it wasn't a person.

62 active joints. Flexible spine. Synthetic muscles. 22 degrees of freedom per hand (can handle eggs without crushing them). Three Turing AI chips with 2,250 TOPS of computing power. Powered by solid-state batteries.

Mass production starts end of 2026. Production prep begins April 2026.

That's not future tech. That's next year.

Elon Musk's reaction: ""Tesla and China companies will dominate the market."" Coming from him that's either dismissive or he's actually concerned.

**OpenAI's video generator is now a top 5 global app**

Sora 2 launched on Android November 4th. Day one downloads: 470,000.

For context: iPhone version got 110,000 downloads on day one. Android got 4x that in 24 hours.

It's the #4 app on the US App Store right now. It's less than two months old.

You can open an app and generate photorealistic video with text prompts and we're already treating this as normal.

**Google quietly released something that eliminates entire job categories**

Google dropped DS-STAR with almost no fanfare. It's a multi-agent AI system that converts messy business problems into working Python code.

It handles chaos. Unstructured data, CSV files, JSON, whatever. Multiple AI agents work together: one analyzes, one plans, one codes, one validates. They iterate until it works.

Most AI data tools need clean inputs. This one just works with whatever mess you throw at it.

This might quietly make mid-level data analyst positions obsolete and nobody's even talking about it.

**Here's what actually scares me**

All of this happened in seven days. One week.

Startups don't need human coders anymore. Apple can't build competitive AI alone. Machines are solving MIT-level math perfectly. Robots are indistinguishable from humans. Video generation is mainstream. Data analysis is automated.

When I list it out like this it sounds like bad sci-fi but these are just facts from this week.

I think we already passed the inflection point and we're too close to see it. Like we're standing at the base of an exponential curve looking up and thinking it's still linear.

The singularity isn't some future event we're waiting for. I think it already happened sometime in the last few months and we're just now seeing the evidence pile up.

**Real questions:**

Are we already living in post-singularity and just don't realize it yet?

What from this week actually scared you? The job displacement? Apple's surrender? The robot? Or are you already numb?

I dated my ex for two years, his first two years of med school. We met six months before he started. Before school began, I was the one who brought up how to make long distance work. We talked about virtual dates (they never happened), but I still visited him once a month.

When I visited, I cooked all the meals, did his laundry, and helped tidy up. It slowly became expected. He never cooked for me once, even though I knew he cooked when I wasn’t there. I’d buy coffee for both of us, but he’d only buy for himself. Once he grabbed two clementines, saw one was bruised, and handed me that one while keeping the better one. Small things, but they added up.

Every time I flew to see him, he picked me up from the airport at least 45 minutes late ..always because he was “cleaning” for me. I didn’t complain much. The only thing I really asked for was consistent effort something that showed we had a future. But he’d avoid those conversations. which would cause me to be emotional often.

Meanwhile, my dad was battling stage IV cancer and my younger brother was developing schizophrenia. My life was falling apart. Through it all, he said the right things .. comforted me, promised we were a team. I believed him.

Then a month after my dad died, he broke up with me over the phone , the day before our anniversary. He said he had “darkness inside” he needed to face and called me “the right person, wrong time.” Two weeks earlier, he had visited me, met my family, told me he loved me, and acted off the whole time . emotional, distant, picking fights, almost like he knew it was over.

During that last visit, I was grieving and on my period, but he kept pushing for intimacy anyway. It felt disconnected — like he wanted closeness on his terms, not mine. When I said something felt off between us, he teared up. I thought it was empathy, but now I think it was guilt.

Barely a week into breaking up with me, he posted a thirst trap and followed a bunch of girls. Then he completely ghosted me. no check-in, nothing all in the name of “self peace” . And now he’s on social media trying to go viral the same guy who used to mock classmates for doing that, calling it “a bad look for a future doctor.” Some of his posts feel like digs at me, like he’s rewriting our story to make himself look justified.

Watching that has been surreal. How do you go from being someone’s best friend and emotional safe space to their public cautionary tale? It’s messed with my head. I’ve been questioning my own reality wondering if I imagined the love, or if he just performed it. I’ve always felt like his family thought I wasn’t good enough for him or I was distracting him, i think that may have been a part of it.

I’ve been single and celibate since. The idea of dating or trusting another man genuinely scares me. I feel emotionally unstable, hypervigilant, and ashamed that I didn’t see this coming. I don’t even trust myself to read people anymore.

I know med school is demanding, but I can’t help but feel he used that as a shield for selfishness. He didn’t just leave me..he erased me. And it’s taken away my sense of safety in myself.

Has anyone else gone through this where someone said all the right things, called you “the one,” then rewrote the story like you never mattered? How did you start trusting again?",6,1762795683.0,MedSpouse,9,1.0,False

1otjzmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1otjzmo/aita_for_not_wanting_to_lose_my_best_friend_who/,AITA for not wanting to lose my best friend (who also happens to be my ex)?,"I (37M, Black, probably somewhere on the neurodivergent spectrum but undiagnosed) dated my ex “Ted” (47M, white, diagnosed but high-masking AuDHD) for about two years. We’ve been broken up for a year and a half, but he’s still one of my closest friends—and I’m really struggling with what to do next.

I ended the relationship because our communication and conflict-resolution styles were complete opposites. I’m someone who needs to talk things out. If there’s tension, I can’t stop replaying it in my head until we resolve it. Ted, on the other hand, shuts down. He’ll go silent for days, and when he’s finally “over it,” he acts like nothing ever happened. That silence drives me crazy—I end up running conversations in my head, trying to figure out what I did wrong and how to fix it.

During our relationship, the things that set him off often felt irrational or based on assumptions about my intentions rather than my actions. For example:

•	I didn’t “know” when it was time to leave somewhere, even though he never told me.

•	I talked too long with friends when he wanted to go home and should’ve “read his cues.”

•	I asked him not to snap his fingers to get my attention, which he somehow took as me calling him racist (I absolutely wasn’t).

•	I chewed too loudly—his misophonia was triggered, and when I said “I can’t control that,” he saw it as dismissive.

•	I fall asleep during movies. If I start one after 7, it’s pretty much guaranteed I’ll be out cold.

•	I woke up early and played video games or worked on writing while waiting for him to wake up—apparently proof I didn’t want to spend time with him.

•	I said, “It won’t be the end of the world” when he was worried about guests arriving early to my booth at Comic-Con before we’d finished setting up. The comment wasn’t directed at him, but it earned me a two-day silent treatment.

•	I didn’t call him back right away while at dinner with coworkers on a work trip, which to him meant I must be cheating.

There are plenty more examples, but you get the picture. I rarely initiated fights, yet I was constantly defending myself. I always felt like I was walking on eggshells.

To be clear—Ted isn’t a bad person. He’s incredibly loyal, passionate, and genuinely caring. But his emotions can be intense, and once he’s upset, he completely withdraws. For someone like me—who processes through communication—that silence felt like torture.

We broke up twice during our relationship. The first time was when my job shifted to full-time travel. And I would be on the road 98% of the time. He told me he “couldn’t talk” to me while I was away because he was mad that I wasn’t home. I realized then that long-distance (and frankly, the relationship) wouldn’t work. But he later told me I “didn’t give him a chance” to prove he could handle it, so we tried again.

The same patterns returned immediately—especially when I came back from work trips abroad. One fight stands out: after a long flight home from England, I was jet-lagged and exhausted. I woke up early and sat on the couch playing a game on my phone while waiting for him to wake up. When he finally did, he didn’t say a word, just walked past me into the bathroom, then into the kitchen. I figured he needed coffee, so when he sat near me, I hugged his leg affectionately as a silent “good morning.” He didn’t respond. Then he asked what I wanted to do that day, and I said I wasn’t sure—“whatever we do, I just don’t want to be out too long in the July heat.” That annoyed him, though I didn’t realize it at the time.

He had also made a hand-drawn calendar for us to fill out together, which I thought was sweet. But when I didn’t immediately sit down to fill it out right then and there, he took it as proof that I didn’t appreciate it or didn’t want to spend time with him.

Later, we decided to visit a local art district—somewhere I’d never been and he was excited to show me. I was genuinely enjoying it and said so multiple times. After a while, I got thirsty and asked if we could find a place to get some water. He took that as complaining and stormed back to the car. To him, that simple request meant I wasn’t enjoying myself or didn’t want to be there. To me, it was just… being human and thirsty.

After that, the silent treatment began. Three days of  complete silence, while living in the same house. I tried to bridge the gap by suggesting we take a walk, to which he agreed, but we did the whole walk in silence. On the second day, he left the house without saying a word—no goodbye, no “I’ll be back.” Just gone. So I went on a walk myself. Did my own thing that day. And came home to more silence. 

On the third day, when I finally asked to talk, he said he was “having trouble believing I cared about him.” I didn’t even know what else to say. I’d shown him love in every way I could think of—buying souvenirs for him from every place I visited, FaceTiming across time zones, calculating schedules so I could text him good morning and good night every day. I even came straight off a plane from England to volunteer at his work gala, after being awake for 24 hours. But somehow, it was never enough.

Eventually, I ended the relationship. I told him I loved him, but I couldn’t live in constant emotional uncertainty. He’s never really understood why I left—he still thinks I “gave up.”

After we broke up, we stayed friends. He’s been incredibly loyal and still helps me from time to time at work events. We genuinely have fun together. He’s said before that it’s hard for neurodivergent people to find understanding friendships, so I promised him I wouldn’t abandon him as a friend. But I’ve also told him our needs don’t match romantically. I need consistent communication; he needs someone less emotionally reactive to silence.

Now here’s the problem: I’ve started seeing someone new (6 months in), and it’s going really well. My new partner is kind, grounded, and—most importantly—communicative. He knows I’m still friends with my ex and has been understanding about it. But Ted is struggling. He gets jealous when I go on dates, says he “doesn’t want to know” and gets upset when I answer honestly. He’s said he’s still “having a hard time processing” me being with someone else and feels like I “never gave us a real chance.”

I’ve even offered to give him space, but he insists he doesn’t want it. Still, every time the topic of me dating someone else comes up, the tension between us grows thick.

I feel torn. I don’t believe Ted and I will ever work romantically—he’s never acknowledged the actual problem, and I don’t think he ever will. But he’s also my best friend, he’s been one of the most consistent people in my life and the idea of losing him breaks my heart. I don’t want to hurt him or abandon him, but I also don’t want his jealousy to sabotage something healthy I’m building. I feel like no matter what I do, I’m the bad guy.

For some reason I’m always shocked to find you’re not here anymore on the first day of the work week.   It’s been so long since you were and yet today, like every Monday you’ve been gone I still can’t quite accept that I won’t get to see you today.   

But today is different, worse maybe?, a sad kind of quiet I hold inside while I still have a fantasy of what this day would have looked like if it was us.  If we had made it work, if only….  

I’ve stopped writing, not because I don’t have the words, not because you stopped inspiring me, not because I’ve stopped loving you, but because I know you need silence from me.  It’s painful, and I hate it, but I know you’re right, I’m accepting that, and for now am mustering enough strength to give you the silence you need.  

But today is my cheat day, a day that I’m allowing myself to come back and tell you a fantasy I’d love to share with you.  

Today, in a parallel universe, you’re just waking up now.  I’m bringing you in your dumb coffee made with things I’d never drink, but I know you love.  I’d sneak back into bed and hold you while you woke up, turning over and gently kissing your beautiful face.  Maybe we go sit on the couch and wake up together while we sip coffee, no need to talk, we like the silence in each others company.  

Let’s go get breakfast in a bit, or I could  take you to brunch, or go to your favorite spot.  Im along for the ride today, but I don’t care as long as we are together.   I’d love to just go on a drive with you, maybe we find a quiet hot spring somewhere, just take a day trip on the road together, slip into some warm water alone and waste a few hours together.   

We’ll get back in time for dinner out at that restaurant you love, a quiet romantic spot, where I get to stare into your beautiful eyes over a few glasses of wine and some whiskey.  

The weather won’t matter, the place wouldn’t either, because it’s only you with me that makes the difference.  

The day is yours my love, and in my endless fantasies the constant is us, together, holding hands, smiling and laughing, enjoying each other.  

I hope you have the best day today, and until fate allows this will stay a fantasy for me.   

I won’t see you today, but you will be on my mind all day.  

I hope you get to have the best Monday today, I hope you know how special it was having you in my life, and I hope you go to sleep tonight knowing how loved you are.  ",2,1762795505.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False
1otjx75,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1otjx75/i_accidentally_started_a_tiny_morning_routine/,I accidentally started a tiny morning routine with a stranger and now I look forward to it every day,"Every morning I stop at the same crosswalk on my way to work. There is this older guy who walks his dog at exactly the same time. The dog is a fluffy old corgi shaped like a loaf of bread. At first we just nodded at each other in that awkward yep we exist on the same sidewalk way.



One day the corgi just decided we were friends. He waddled over and sat on my foot like a warm potato. The man looked surprised and said wow she usually ignores people. I scratched her behind one ear and she did that full body wiggle that made her look like a happy gelatin block. From then on every morning she pulls her leash toward me when she sees me.



Now we have this silly three second ritual. I say good morning princess. She snorts at me like she is offended I dont bow. Then she lets me pat her head before the light changes. The owner laughs every time and says I think she likes you more than me. I pretend to be shocked but inside I am delighted that a tiny loaf dog has chosen me as her sidewalk bestie.



It is such a small thing but it makes the day feel softer. When work is stressful or I spill coffee on my shirt or someone sends a reply all email that should not exist I think ok at least the corgi approved me today. It is like a small reminder that simple moments can be enough.



Do any of you have those micro rituals with strangers. Someone you only see at the same time or place who gives the day a tiny spark. I did not know morning joy could be shaped like a corgi but apparently this is my life now and I am grateful.

1otjwx6,https://www.reddit.com/r/nespresso/comments/1otjwx6/top_6_reasons_why_refilling_empty_pods_is_a_bad/,TOP 6 REASONS WHY REFILLING EMPTY PODS IS A BAD IDEA.,"Just to be clear, I don’t give a crap who thinks I’m a Nespresso employee or thinks I’m being a “Fanboy” for the company. I’m being realistic and blunt. If you can’t handle the truth then skip this thread.

#1) If your machine becomes damaged (and it has happened with multiple people here) Nespresso states on their website that it voids the warranty. Don’t believe me? Go check it out.  Oh, you’re already out of warranty? You’d be buying another machine.


#2) You’re not getting quality coffee no matter what brand of coffee you buy because once fresh ground coffee hits the air it instantly begins to oxidize. Nespresso’s pods are hermetically sealed and there is zero air inside the pods. That’s why you can buy unopened pods from private sellers that are over a year old and they are still fresh and good for consumption, even if they are past the recommended consumption date. 

Making your own pods traps air inside of them and within an hour your coffee has oxidized and loses flavor and quality. So unless you’re brewing all of your pods within the same hour of making them you would be better off buying year-old coffee beans from a convenience store. 

#3) You’re not saving money. That’s total BS when people make that excuse to create their own pods. A $15 USD box of 10 pods is a $1.50 USD per pod, so that’s $1.50 USD for a cup of coffee. Add your milk, flavors and sweetener, if you will, and you may be spending $3.00 USD if you want that fancy latte. For me I drink my coffee 100% black so it’s only $1.50 or less because I have both the OL and the VL. 


#4) The point of Nespresso (or even that horrid Keurig) is convince. Neither company tries to convince people they are saving money going with a pod system. When I fix my breakfast it’s maddening to do a Pour Over or French Press (which I have both) at the same time. That’s why I bought my Nespresso machines. Making your own pods takes time, patience and practice, and if you don’t value your time then that’s very sad for you. I value my time and I put a price tag on my time. 


#5) Unless you have deep pockets you’d be spending more money buying your own coffee beans because you basically have to stick to one flavor/type of coffee until your beans run out, unless you have the money to buy multiple bags of coffee types. That’s what I love about using Nespresso is I can buy dark roast, medium roast, flavored coffee and switch up each day, or even mix the coffee pods for a different flavor. 

#6) Lastly, (and this will appear that I am being a fanboy to the Nestle haters with personal axe’s to grind with the company) if as a whole we decide to make our own pods that will cause Nespresso’s prices to go up. Yes, that’s a fact. When companies lose money they do not reduce prices to get more customers, they make it up by charging more. I mean, you bought the Nespresso machine knowing how it works, so trying to circumvent how the system works could end up costing the consumer more in the end as prices will rise.

1otjwdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/VietNam/comments/1otjwdz/feedback_vietnam_trip_everything_i_looked_for/,Feedback Vietnam Trip - Everything I looked for & didn't find (and more),"**Hi there,**

I just came back from a Vietnam trip (end of October 2025 to beginning of November). I looked for a lot of information while preparing this trip but didn’t find everything I needed, so I figured I’d share my experience here. Maybe it will help someone. Writing everything down will probably take a few edits as more details pop into my head.

# Prologue

I’m a 31-year-old male from Belgium. I love travelling but I wouldn’t call myself an adventurous backpacker. My main motivation is curiosity + love for scenic views & wildlife. Before Vietnam, I travelled to Colombia, Costa Rica, Ile de la Réunion, and the Azores (during the pandemic so restricted to Schengen back then).

I like surfing, skiing, hiking to viewpoints, seeing wildlife, having a good time, drinking beers, learning about local culture and history, trying traditional food, tasting local coffee… basically anything that lets me experience new things.

# Overall feeling about Vietnam

Vietnam is an amazing country and, compared to Colombia or Costa Rica, it’s easier to travel in. The choice for Vietnam was twofold:

1. I wanted to visit Southeast Asia for the first time (I originally considered Cambodia or Sri Lanka).
2. My girlfriend (32F) is not a backpacker type, so Vietnam was a good compromise for both of us.

The food is incredible, locals are extremely friendly, and there’s a wide variety of things to do. You can see the highlights of the entire country in a few weeks if you plan efficiently.

One downside for me: many tourist attractions and viewpoints feel very touristy or artificial. A lot of temples are relatively new (1960s–1990s), so I missed the feeling of older historical sites. But that’s just personal preference.

# Itinerary

* Arrival in Ho Chi Minh City from Belgium
* Ho Chi Minh City – 2 days
* Hoi An – 2 days
* Hue – 2 days (had to skip due to floods)
* Sapa – 2 days
* Ha Giang Loop – 2 days
* Ha Long Bay – 2.5 days
* Ninh Binh – daytrip from Hanoi
* Hanoi – 5 days

If I had to do it again:

* More time in Hanoi (3 days instead of 5 is still fine, but I’d enjoy 3 properly)
* More time in Hue (3 days)
* More time in Sapa (at least 3 days)
* Ha Giang Loop should be 3 days, not 2

I would sacrifice Ho Chi Minh City — in my opinion, it’s not essential. Mekong Delta was nice, but Cu Chi tunnels can be done in Hue as well.

# Small tips that are worth gold

* **Shoes vs slippers:** Locals live in crocs/slippers, and it makes sense especially in rainy season. It’s warm, so being wet doesn’t matter as much. Wear shoes only for hikes or safety.
* **Poncho vs raincoat:** Poncho beats raincoat during heavy rain. A raincoat sends the water onto your trousers, poncho keeps you and your bag dry. Used mine constantly.
* **Transportation:** Grab all the way, except for long-distance travel (use buses via 12go). Grab is cheap, fast, and reliable. A 10–15 min ride is around 1€. I think we spent 60–70€ on Grab during a 3-week trip.
* **Tailoring:** I went to two tailors. Bari Tailor and Shine Tailor. I made my suits at Shine. Bari was a bit too direct and felt less professional. Shine was really friendly, made suggestions without being pushy, and claimed to be family-run. No idea if that’s true, but the experience was good. I paid 8.6M VND for two suits: a navy two-piece and an olive green two-piece with a Kingsman-style vest. Almost no negotiation. Very happy with the results.
* **Tailor-made shoes:** Got custom sandals (Birkenstock-style) for 600k VND (\~20€). You can choose material, color, buckle, etc. The sole isn’t exactly like Birkenstock but good enough.
* **Finding restaurants:** My strategy: *if you’re the only traveler there and everyone else is Vietnamese, you’re in the right place.* My best meals came from random street-side spots.

1otjqdx,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1otjqdx/best_gifts_for_international_travelers/,Best Gifts for International Travelers,"Last Christmas, I gifted my sister a travel neck pillow. One of those inflatable U-shaped ones everyone seems to recommend. She smiled, thanked me, and I felt pretty good about myself.

Six months later, I found it still in the box during a closet cleanout at her place. ""It's just... so bulky,"" she admitted. ""And honestly? Kind of uncomfortable.""

That's when I realized: there's a massive gap between travel gifts that *sound* practical and gifts travelers will actually use. After talking to dozens of frequent flyers and obsessively researching what actually earns a permanent spot in carry-ons, I've learned that the best gifts aren't always the most obvious ones.

Here are the gifts international travelers will genuinely appreciate—the ones that solve real problems without adding bulk or becoming drawer clutter.

# 1. Anker Nano Travel Adapter ($20-26)

If your traveler friend is relatively new to international trips, this is gold. But here's the catch: skip this if they're already a seasoned globetrotter. They definitely have one (or three).

The Anker Nano works in over 200 countries and charges five devices simultaneously—one AC outlet, two USB-C ports, and two USB-A ports. At under an inch thick, it slips into a jacket pocket. The 20W USB-C port can charge an iPhone to 50% in about 26 minutes, which is clutch during airport layovers.

**Honest downside**: It's a two-prong adapter only, so no grounding for high-power devices. But for phones, tablets, and laptops? Perfect. The best part is it doesn't look like every other chunky adapter—the slim design means it won't fall out of loose European outlets.

I've used mine across 15 countries and it's never let me down. Just make sure they don't already own one before gifting.

# 2. Thule Compression Packing Cubes ($40-50)

This feels like an expensive gift for what's essentially fabric rectangles. But hear me out: compression packing cubes are one of those ""I didn't know I needed this until I tried it"" items that travelers genuinely rave about.

The Thule set comes with one small and one medium cube made from water-repellent ripstop nylon with premium YKK zippers. Unlike regular packing cubes, these have two zippers—one to close, another to compress everything down by about 20%. You can fit a shocking amount in your carry-on by eliminating dead air between clothes.

One friend told me: ""I was anti-packing cube for years. Now I can't pack without them."" The semi-transparent fabric lets you see what's inside without fully opening them, and the webbing handle makes it easy to grab and hang.

**The catch**: They're heavier than cheaper alternatives. But the durability is worth it—these will survive years of travel. Perfect for someone who's always complaining about luggage space.

# 3. Compression Socks by Comrad or Bombas ($15-30)

Yes, socks. I know, I know—socks have a reputation as the world's most boring gift. But compression socks are different.

These aren't your grandpa's medical stockings. Modern compression socks from brands like Comrad and Bombas look like regular socks but provide graduated compression that actually makes a difference on long flights. They reduce leg swelling, help prevent blood clots, and make your legs feel less like concrete after 12 hours in economy.

I was skeptical until I wore them on a flight to Tokyo. The difference was noticeable—my ankles didn't balloon, and I didn't have that gross heavy-leg feeling I usually get.

**Fair warning**: They're tighter than normal socks, which takes getting used to. Some people find them uncomfortable at first. But for frequent flyers dealing with puffy ankles and achy legs? Game changer.

# 4. Cadence Capsules ($14-40)

These magnetic, stackable containers are definitely a splurge item—which makes them perfect as a gift. Most travelers won't buy them for themselves but will absolutely use them once they have them.

Each container is TSA-approved at 0.56 ounces and designed for skincare products, vitamins, or beauty essentials. They're leak-proof, BPA-free, and the magnetic feature means you can stick them together to save space. Plus, they come with labels so you're not guessing which one has face wash versus shampoo at 6 AM in a hotel bathroom.

**The downside**: They're pricey—a set of six small capsules runs around $70. But they're infinitely reusable and eliminate the nightmare of those cheap travel bottles that leak all over your clothes. If you're gifting, start with a set of 4 small containers for around $30-40. That's enough for their core products without breaking your budget.

# 5. Trtl Travel Pillow ($30-40)

Remember that inflatable neck pillow I botched? This is what I should have bought instead.

The Trtl doesn't look like a traditional travel pillow—it's a fleece-wrapped internal support system that holds your neck in place while you sleep upright. It looks weird (kind of like a neck scarf with structure) but it genuinely works better than those U-shaped pillows.

People either love it or find it too restrictive. The design only supports one side of your neck, so you have to commit to leaning one direction. But for those who click with it, they swear by it. I've seen people on long-haul flights wrapped in their Trtls sleeping peacefully while everyone else contorts around their inflatable donuts.

**The real benefit**: It's machine washable and packs down way smaller than traditional travel pillows. It won't take up half a carry-on like those bulky alternatives.

# 6. Stojo Collapsible Cup ($15-20)

This is for the traveler who's environmentally conscious and hits coffee shops everywhere they go.

The Stojo cup collapses down to about an inch tall and fits in your pocket or bag. It's leak-proof (actually leak-proof, not ""mostly leak-proof""), comes with a reusable straw, and holds 16-24 oz depending on the size. At cafes, you just whip it out, get your coffee, and avoid contributing to the single-use cup problem.

One colleague uses hers religiously: ""I saw someone recommend it on Reddit and figured why not. Now I use it daily, not just while traveling."" It's available in tons of colors, so you can pick one that matches their vibe.

**Honest truth**: You have to remember to bring it. If they're forgetful, this becomes another unused travel item. But for someone who's mindful about sustainability and genuinely wants to reduce waste? They'll love it.

# 7. Loop Quiet Earplugs ($15-25)

These aren't headphones—they're actual earplugs designed for travelers. But they're way better than those foam ones from the drugstore.

Loop Quiet earplugs reduce noise by about 27 decibels without completely blocking everything out. You can still hear your alarm or flight announcements, but the airplane engine roar, crying babies, and snoring seatmates fade into background noise. They come with multiple ear tip sizes, don't fall out easily, and are comfortable enough to sleep in.

**Why travelers love them**: They're reusable, washable, and come in a compact carrying case. They're also subtle—they don't stick out like bright orange foam plugs. For light sleepers who stay in hostels or hotel rooms with thin walls, these are essential.

The only catch is finding the right fit takes some trial and error with the different tip sizes.

# 8. AirFly Pro Bluetooth Adapter ($40-55)

This solves a specific but annoying problem: using your wireless headphones with airplane entertainment systems that only have headphone jacks.

The AirFly Pro is a tiny Bluetooth transmitter that plugs into any headphone jack and connects to your wireless earbuds. No more using those terrible airline headphones or carrying wired backups. It also works with hotel TVs, gym equipment, and older devices.

The Duo version ($35) lets two people connect their headphones to the same device, which is perfect for couples who want to watch movies together on flights. Battery lasts about 16-20 hours, which covers even the longest flights.

**Real talk**: It's a single-purpose gadget. If they already use wired headphones for travel, this is useless. But for someone committed to their AirPods or other wireless earbuds? This makes their travel experience significantly better.

# 9. Matador Pocket Blanket ($30-35)

This is one of those ""didn't know I needed it"" items. The Matador Pocket Blanket is a water-resistant, compact blanket that packs down to the size of a deck of cards but unfolds to a full picnic-sized blanket.

It's perfect for impromptu beach days, park hangs, outdoor concerts, or just having a clean surface to sit on. It comes with corner pockets you can fill with sand or rocks to keep it from blowing away, and the material is genuinely water-resistant—not just water-repellent.

I love mine for those random travel moments you can't plan for. Found a perfect sunset spot but the ground is wet? No problem. Want to have an impromptu picnic but didn't pack anything? Boom, blanket.

**The catch**: Some people will never use it. If your traveler sticks to cities and hotels, this might not get much action. But for adventure travelers who love spontaneous outdoor moments? It's brilliant.

# The Bottom Line

The best travel gifts solve real problems without adding bulk. Before buying anything, ask yourself: ""Would I want to carry this in my already-full carry-on?"" If the answer is maybe, keep looking.

Also, consider what type of traveler you're buying for. Business travelers value different things than backpackers. Someone doing two weeks in Europe wants different gear than someone off-grid in Southeast Asia.

And please—skip the money belts. Just skip them.

When I worked in an office I basically lived on sad sandwiches and whatever was closest to the building. My brain refused to think about food until I was already starving. Then I would buy the fastest option and spend the afternoon feeling like a half melted candle. Once I went remote I realized I could actually cook lunch like a real human but I still kept grabbing random snacks because habits are sticky.



So I made a rule. Every day before 11am I pick what my lunch will be and prep at least one part. Sometimes its chopping veggies. Sometimes its just washing rice and putting it in the cooker. The rule is that future me at 1pm should not be making decisions while hungry. If I break the rule then I have to eat whatever sad leftovers exist in the fridge. Yes this sounds dumb but hunger me is lazy and hates sad leftovers so it works.



The funny part is that 15 minutes of prep changed my whole afternoon vibe. I used to crash at 3pm and scroll nonsense to survive the rest of the day. Now I eat real food and somehow I have energy. Like I blink and suddenly I am actually finishing a task instead of staring at the screen with existential dread while holding cold coffee.



Also cooking at lunch weirdly became a brain reset. While veggies sizzle I get a break from thinking about work. I come back feeling like I returned from a tiny vacation in my own kitchen. No commute. No sad sandwiches. Just a small ritual that tells my brain we are halfway there keep going. 



If you are remote and still eating like a stressed raccoon I swear one lil rule changes everything. Prep one thing before 11am. Let hungry you enjoy the win later.

For a lot of us, days feel more like whack-a-mole. You wake up with a plan, then your inbox explodes, someone needs somethingimmediately, your brain decides now is the time to spiral, and suddenly it’s 4pm and your to-do list is untouched.

This post is for the people whose days are unpredictable, unstructured, or justmessy. Think freelancers, shift workers, caregivers, chronically online people, ADHDers, students who live off caffeine and vibes. You might’ve tried productivity hacks from TikTok or Instagram, but most of them are made by people who treat vibe-iness as a personality. The truth is, most viral advice works great when your life looks like a Pinterest board. But if you’re in real life? You need better tools.

So I dug into actual research, books, podcast convos with real expertsnot hustle brosand curated what actually works for chaotic schedules. These tips are not about willpower or ""just waking up earlier."" Here’s what helps, backed by science and real-life experience.

Take what resonates. Leave what doesn’t. This is not your fault. But itissomething you can get better at.

Use ""temporal landmarks"" to press restart on any day

 Coined by behavioral scientists Hengchen Dai and Katy Milkman (authors ofThe Fresh Start Effect), temporal landmarks are moments that feel like new beginningsMonday, the first of the month, after a nap, even after lunch.

 Studies inPsychological Scienceshow that people are more likely to take action on goals when they feel like they're starting fresheven if it's artificial.  

Try this:Instead of waiting for motivation or tomorrow, say:“Okay, new block starts at 2pm.”Use that moment to reset. Journaling or even splashing water on your face can help ritualize it.

Set tiny anchors instead of full routines

 If you can’t predict your days, don’t build a strict schedule. Build micro-habits attached toanchorsthings youknowwill happen, even if timing changes. This concept is big in BJ Fogg’sTiny Habitsframework.

 Fogg says habit success rates jump when you attach a habit to a reliable behaviornot a time.  

   “After I pour my coffee, I’ll write one sentence.”  

   “When I close my laptop, I’ll stretch for 30 seconds.”  

   “After brushing my teeth, I’ll review tomorrow’s plans.”  

 This transforms habits from “I have to find time for it” into “I’ll just do it when \_\_\_ happens.”

Plan your dayafterit starts

 If mornings are unpredictable, delay your planning. Cal Newport, author ofDeep WorkandTime Block Planner, suggests doing your planningonce noise has settlednot before the chaos.

 Mid-morning (or post-lunch) planning is more realistic for people with ADHD, kids, or constantly shifting demands.

Try this:Block out 10 minutes at 11am or 2pm daily to reassess. Write down 3 priorities, and anchor the rest around those.

Use the 3-tier to-do list to avoid overwhelm

 Nir Eyal, author ofIndistractable, recommends breaking tasks intoDo,Defer, andDelete. But we can scale it down for chaotic days:

  Tier 1: Must-do(absolutely needs to happen today)

  Tier 2: Should-do(important, but can be moved)

  Tier 3: Nice-to-do(optional if energy and time align)

 Don’t overload Tier 1. One or two things max. The goal is always to win the daynot finish everything.

Apply the “10-minute rule” for emotional resistance

 When your brain screams “I don’t wanna,” clinical psychologist Dr. Ali Mattu (YouTube:The Psych Show) recommends using the 10-minute rule.

 Say:“I'll just do this for 10 minutes, then I can stop.”

 Studies on cognitive resistance (especially for ADHD and depression) show thatstartingis the hardest part. Once in motion, most people keep going.

 This works especially well for tasks you dread, like replying to emails or doing dishes.

Track energy, not time

 InThe Power of Full Engagement, Tony Schwartz explains that energynot timeis the real currency of productivity. Especially when life is unpredictable.

 You may not be able to control your schedule, but you can learn your energy map:

   When are your low-energy hours?

   When do you feel most alert or calm?

 Use a simple mood + energy tracker daily. Apps likeReflectlyor even a notebook work.

 Then batch certain tasks accordingly:

   Use high energy for creative work

   Use low energy for admin or cleaning

Design for friction (or lack of)

 James Clear (author ofAtomic Habits) popularized this idea:Make good habits easy, bad habits hard.This matters WAY more when your day is chaotic.

 For example:

   Keep your to-do app open, not Twitter.

   Put your workout clothes on your chair, not in a drawer.

   Block sites withFreedomorCold Turkeyduring focus hours.

 Make what you want to do 10 seconds easier to start. Make what distracts you 10 seconds harder to access.

Don't romanticize long sessions. Microdose productivity.

 Research from the Draugiem Group (using the DeskTime productivity tracker) shows that top performers work in 52-minute sprints with 17-minute breaks.

 Newer research from UC Irvine reveals that most interruptions don’t destroy productivityifyou work in short, focused bursts and allow mental resets.

 Instead of waiting for a long empty window, build in “focus snacks.”  

   15 mins: Write bullet points for email  

   10 mins: Mind dump or journal  

   5 mins: Sort files or close tabs  

 These micro-doses add up, especially when full hours are rare.

Forgive the ""unproductive"" days. Account for them.

 Productivity coach Tiago Forte (creator ofBuilding a Second Brain) says the biggest mistake people make is overplanning “ideal” days without accounting forlife.

 Build buffer spaces. Leave white space on purpose. Don’t plan work for every minute.

Tip:Start your to-do list with “Today might go sideways.” You’re less likely to feel like a failure later.

If your days feel unstable, inconsistent, or justa lot, that doesn’t mean you’re lazy or broken. You just need a different playbook than the one designed for factory schedules or 9-to-5ers with zero variables. These tools aren’t ""get your life together overnight"" solutions. But theyareproven ways to build structure in chaos, and momentum in messiness.

1. Put in your ""fricken"" ear protection. Trust us. Every time you get the chance. Ya, there may be times when you can't but every little bit helps. Trust us on thia... the ringing gets to you after a couple decades...

2. A strong core MIGHT protect your back. I know, you wake in the AM and nothing hurts today. But protect you back when-ever you get the chance. Theres gonna be days when you can't. But waking up and deciding you're not putting on socks till after pills and coffee is a real thing after 50 for some of us. 

3. Cherish the clowns. They may baffle you, frustrate you, make you want to bang your head into the wall with their stupidity... but they got your back. Thats hard to find wether you EAS after 4 or 20. Use today's tech to stay in contact. 

4. You guys, take pics of the approved places and times. Those memories fade and glancing at a pic 35 years after it was taken will literally warm you heart <that may or may not be healthy> 

4A. Don't be a blue falcon. Don't take ""that"" pic 

5. Today is better than 4 years of collage. Its better than a ""gap"" year. What you're going through , be it ""the suck"" or better times, WILL make you better. I know you cant see it. Have a little faith 

Excuse us old farts if we get a little drunk, stupid and sentimental today. You'll stand in the same faded yellow boot prints as us at the 300th...

What would you do","You wake up tomorrow and realize you have a new power. At exactly 8 AM, in the time zone you are in, on the first day of each month, you can magically inhabit the body and mind any living person you choose. This inhabitation will only last for 1 hour.  You do not have to inhabit anybody if you don’t want to, but you will always have the choice at 8 AM on the first day of each month.  You can only choose one person to inhabit each month and can leave their body before the hour is up, but cannot return during the hour if you leave early.  You can keep going back to the same person month after month, or choose a different person each month, or any combination, but only one person, for only up to one hour each month.

While you are inhabiting their body you have all their memories and thoughts while retaining your own. You also have their likes and dislikes overlayed on yours. So, if you hate coffee ice cream but they love it, you will know you don't like it, but if you have some while in their body, you will enjoy it. If their body dies while you are in it, you die. If your original body dies during that hour you die, but they keep living. If their body is injured while you are in it, you will feel the pain, but only while you are in their body, their body will recover, or not, after you leave it.  Likewise, if you expose their body to any pathogens, they will have to live with the effects, once you are back in your body there will be no impact on you.  You have total control over their speech, body, and thoughts while inhabiting them; feeling all the things they would feel.  However, the thoughts you have while inhabiting their body/mind will fade quickly from their consciousness after you leave, so you will not be able to alter their personality in the long term.  They will have no awareness that you are in their body and mind and will not realize what happened, even after you return to your own body.  If you do or say something that they were considering, they will just chalk it up to them acting on their own ideas. If you do or say something completely out of character or something they would never do, they will be perplexed, and just think, ""not sure why I did or said that.""

So, who do you inhabit and what do you do?  Do you do something to impact politics, or power, or do you act to improve your finances, or the world, or do you just decide to have fun in somebody else’s body.",6,1762793948.0,hypotheticalsituation,21,1.0,False

Not because I feel particularly guilty, though there were times when I did- moments of weakness where I felt as if my existence itself was a mistake on a cosmic scale. But rather, because I feel that if I don’t, this story will be wasted.

This story will join me on my deathbed, as I choke on some tepid hospital food and watch the mountains on the monitors turn into flat roads taking me down to hell.

And I would hate for this story to be wasted like that.

I think that someone needs to know it.

Do you?

 

A few years ago, I lived in a detached house at the end of a road, surrounded by enormous trees. Those houses went cheap, you understand — too far from the city for most people.

Not that it bothered me, I could handle the commute, enjoy myself and continue my hobbies without every haggard IT worker and their screaming children worming their way into my life. And the ‘undesirable’ location meant that I got a huge two-floor house, with under-floor heating, a large wooden attic and basement, alongside the greenest garden you would have ever seen.

Of course, as I worked on the garden, it gradually lost that vibrant green colour and became a mess of piles of dirt: seeing as I didn’t exactly want to make it into a beautiful lush paradise and, to be truthful, I didn’t have the greatest green fingers on my soft, sterilised hands.

But this doesn’t matter, what matters is that there were these huge trees in my garden, covering all of this small corner of solace in shade and privacy. Often in windy days and nights the branches of these trees would stretch towards my conservatory door, scratching and scratching- forever desiring to get inside.

By my second year of living in the house, the sounds of these pervasive branches faded into the back of my mind, lost in the hum of my work and the power tools I used in my free time.

I enjoyed working with them- crafting raw material into something new, it’s so chaotic but I love it enough to enjoy the mess and chaos of the process as well.

The day the thing I’d like to talk to you about happened was a chilly November evening, I had come back from a long night’s work- extended by the train journey, busy, loud and hateful-  I only wished to go home and sleep, undisturbed.

I think you can imagine that that wouldn’t happen tonight.

I walked for a good twelve minutes to my house, dodging the trash littered about the street and looking around at the houses- all full, all lively, seeing as it was a Friday night.

There were silhouettes painted on the window, faceless and two-dimensional. I stopped at one and looked at its windows. They were partying.

They lived in a different world to mine, I realised (not for the first time in my life) that they were in a different world- they might as well have been a different species to me. They cared about their relationships, they wanted the best for their fellow man; I was lonely, I doubted I would ever have any real friend or connections.

I’ll admit that I was so full of myself and my angst that I cursed under my breath at this sight.

And then I wished, deep in my mind, that some of them would come to my house.

Yes. Mister Well-Adjusted and Cool, I know.

But I’ve changed.

I hope.

Anyway, as I moved past that house and another, I lost count of these generic buildings, shrouded with curtains and filled with people who would never know who I was.

I counted the numbers on the doors, eventually casting my eyes to the ground when I got a rhythm into my head of when one house of strangers ended and when another began.

68.

70.

72.

74.

84.

86.

8-

80, that was my house.

I stepped past it, in a trance state from the endless pattern of the sidewalk- getting halfway down the hill that my house was situated in until I realised that my lone, imposing monolith of a house was now behind me.

I think that if I had just stopped at my house- just noticed that my empty, loveless home was in front of me- he wouldn’t have seen me.

Just as I began to walk back, I saw the man.

He was standing in the front yard of a house that had its lights off.

A shade of darkness in a greater darkness still.

He seemed to be holding a sprinkler, holding it forward.

I’d seen people on social media who preached about this, about how at night, the plants would absorb the water more efficiently… or something.

He seemed like a strange guy, not that I could comment but-

It wasn’t connected to a tap.

He seemed to be holding it as if the mere idea of water would sustain the grass in front of the house.

I stared at him.

He stared not at me but my house.

This is hypocritical of me, I know, but I don’t like people looking at my house: I guess other people have personal lives that just don’t matter, as such- nothing would happen if I looked in their window and saw them watching TV or whatever. But this guy couldn’t just stare at my house like that, what if he saw me doing something that was personal?

Weirdo.

I moved forward to my door, taking out my keys and shaking my sleeve up in the air to signal to the man that maybe it was time to stop watching my house.

Slowly, I inserted the key and turned it, holding down the handle- to find it jammed. I rushed into the door, pushing against it until it opened, leaving me turning on my excess momentum.

On the other side of the street, the man was gone.

The sprinkler lay forgotten, the house’s lights were still off and the house’s door remained perfectly closed.

Did the guy even live there?

A little confused, I walked into my house and pushed my door shut.

Maybe I’m paranoid. I waited for a few minutes, half-expecting someone to bang on the door with a gun or a knife. Nothing came.

I let out a deep breath; nonetheless, I locked the door to my basement and both conservatory door and the double checked the door to the attic. That was what I did every day, I didn’t want anyone breaking into my house- more than the idea of theft, I hated the possibility that they would poke their nose into my business, taking away my privacy. Until then, I thought that this was enough.

I know now that it was not.

I went to sleep at eleven- reassured that I could sleep in as late as I wished.   
As I idly leapt over my plans for tomorrow, or lack of plans, and my daydreams were replaced with much more frenetic, faded dreams.

I saw visions of my garden, my inaesthetic mounds of dirt waiting to sprout flowers, sights of all those encounters I had had late at night, including this one.

Though in this state of limbo between reality and madness, the man with the sprinkler was out in the open, in front of some endless, warped tower block. His face looked fake- as if it was made out of generic shapes smashed together to make an altogether unnerving composite whole. I stared at the man in my dream for a long time and then, I looked down.

There, on the floor, there was a knife, waiting for me to pick it up- almost calling me. I turned my eyes back up and the man charged.

I only remember this because this was when I woke up.

One of the branches had scratched the downstairs window particularly hard.

Normally, I wouldn’t be woken up by this but I assume the stress of seeing that man looking at my house, watching, and the absurdity of that dream hadn’t exactly helped to keep my mind confined to dreams and slumber.

I got out of bed with a jump, as if there was something I needed to do right then.

As if it was a matter of life and death.

I couldn’t feel the cold.

I could only hear that scratching.

Yet it sounded different.

Were those branches?

I slowly tiptoed down the stairs, painfully aware of every creak that the carpeted floor handed out in complaint of my movement and wished that I had a baseball bat, as both the kitchen and basement were too far away from me for me to get any real weapon.

I took in a deep breath and let it out, I could handle this, I had handled bigger things, worse people and I wasn’t going to die tonight, not tonight, I had so much to do, so many people to meet. I wasn’t meant to be the guy dying.

Something told me that Fate hadn’t intended for me to be the guy dying.

I calmed myself.

Whenever I watched horror movies as a child, I’d always come up with logical steps to escape any situation, yet I never expected that I’d be on this side of the big screen. I had always muttered to myself how *I* would have survived or, more often than not, how I would have killed all the annoying teenagers. Yet, now, my mind came up blank.

I could jump out of the window and run, I supposed.

But then what if someone came into my house and searched it, or what if he waited here and…

I took another step on the staircase, turning the corner to the landing.

Slowly, I stepped down and headed down the hallway.

Through the kitchen.

Turned the key to the conservatory.

Turned the knob.

Opened the door.

And nothing.

It was just the branches.

Swaying and hitting the windows to some gleeful beat.

No one was there.

I would love to tell you that was the end.

That I laughed it off and went back to my hobbies in my own privacy without anyone bothering me.

That I met the guy and his name was Paul, or something, and I included him in my hobby group and we became close acquaintances.

That I locked the kitchen door,  went back to sleep and that was the end of that.

But I woke up a second time that night.

I went to sleep and dreamt of fun and games, by my standards- anyhow, and was in the middle of a game with my colleagues when I heard the sound.

It sounded like a tinkling of chimes and then the sound of a dog wailing, there were thuds downstairs, drumbeats that were followed by mewling sounds.

I got out of bed.

I walked down the stairs quicker now and I walked into the kitchen.

There was the marking of a face on the kitchen door’s pane of glass, the kind that you make as a kid on a bus drive: the kind that comes when you lean on glass and just breathe on it for a long while.

I opened the kitchen drawer and took out a knife.

I don’t think I even questioned what I was doing.

It felt right.

It felt calming, it reassured me that I could make it out of this.

It was natural, just like the tools in the basement.

This is just another tool.

This is just like another project.

Yes, I was still in control here, still in my zone of expertise.

Walking over to the door, I turned the key and opened it.

From the kitchen, I couldn’t see him.

Now, I could.

There, crouching in the corner of the room, holding a piece of shattered glass- most likely coming from the broken conservatory door- and looking at me, wide-eyed and grinning, was a man.

The man sat there for a few seconds, as I regarded him and he regarded me.

He saw the knife.

I looked at the shard of glass.

He nodded, as if he acknowledged me.

He got up slowly and moved towards me, I didn’t flinch or cower back- transfixed by this peculiar man.

He moved as if he was dancing the hokey-cokey, hands in front of him.

He stank, his shirt was practically just a thin film of fabric smeared in a much thicker layer of dirt and what seemed like mud.

There were rolls of flesh on his forehead and every time he smiled two ripples of fat dove across his face.

He wouldn’t stop smiling.

He seemed to be salivating, licking his lips and whispering something under his breath every few steps that he took.

His steps were also comically exaggerated, he walked on tiptoes, covering the tiniest of distances.

When he got a few steps away from me he regarded me with some semblance of childish wonder, gawping and opening his mouth,

“Oh-ho.”

He raised his hands to his mouth, like a wife from the 1950s admitting she had made a surprise for her dear, precious husband.

I lodged the knife into his stomach.

I didn’t get a chance to pull it out, as he had jumped off it- leaving the knife, bloodied, in my hand and a hole in the stomach.

The man doubled over and began to shriek, not scream, just shriek, like some strange animal you’d find in a dark field.

Slowly, with betrayal written in his eyes, he pushed himself off the ground.

He charged at me.

I turned to run; the kitchen door was closed, I turned the doorknob; he was on top of me, yelling and hitting my head with his fists, which felt strangely moist.

I raised the knife over my shoulder, nicking the nape of my neck, and stabbed him in the head.

Once.

Twice.

He let go, rubbing his hands on his head, as if that would fix it.

Some part of my mind chimed up and overlayed an illustration of Humpty Dumpty over the bald, writhing man with a variety of holes in his head.

To be fair, my head was ringing from his percussion-themed attack on my head, that idiot.

Thoughts ran through my head.

I just needed to get to the basement.

I would be safe in the basement.

I couldn’t die in the basement.

I turned the doorknob and entered the kitchen, closing the door firmly behind me.

I dragged myself out of the kitchen, towards my place of rest- the basement.

I heard a muffled cry of anger, then a crash and then that same cry of anger, resumed and amplified.

Desperately, I turned, the thing had managed to crash through my kitchen door’s window.

I dully wondered how much money that would cost.

He ran at me.

I saw the shard of glass in his hand move and I moved my hand up.

His transparent, jagged weapon embedded itself in my palm and remained there.

He grinned at his victory.

I slashed my knife through the air.

A ribbon materialised on his throat; he moved back- still with a slight smirk.

I leapt on him.

I lost track of how many times I stabbed him.

In.

Out.

In.

I stopped when the knife hit bone and got lodged.

Only then did I regard what I had done.

Looking at the mess and mistake I had created.

He looked like a  fat, popped bug.

He did manage to gouge my arm with his little dagger of glass; ask his fingers and face and stomach and neck, they’ll tell you that I won.

I’m not sure when I called the police but it was after I wrapped his head in cellophane- just to make sure.

I was more scared when the police came, early that morning- or late that night, because the adrenaline from the night before had removed any fear I might have felt towards that grinning insanity plea; this was a calm, cold realisation in my gut.

That stupid man had ruined everything.

I was going to get arrested for murder.

They were going to slap on their handcuffs and take me to prison to rot.

It wasn’t my fault, I thought, as I sat on kitchen table- ignoring the suited officers swirling around me- he had broken into my house.

It wasn’t my fault, this time.

I should’ve buried him.

Why me?

Why did he pick my house?

I couldn’t go to jail.

Certainly not for him.

He had ruined everything.

Everything.

Once I calmed down enough, however, I was greeted with the fact that they had only figured out the self-defence part.

The police later told me the truth, or the official truth, five days prior, a man had fled a nearby sanatorium and broken into the house next to mine. He had killed the house’s owners- not at once, they said. Slowly. He had slowly taken them apart, styling their remains in the kitchen. This man hadn’t once turned on the lights in that house, he had stayed with his victims, or- rather- their remains, for three days. He had come outside and- who knows- liked the look of my house. He had broken in and… you know that now.

The rather sympathetic male officer placed a hand on shoulder, the other busy clutching a cup of coffee, and tried to reassure me,

“Don’t worry, he deserved it. Okay? You wouldn’t have been the first guy he tried to kill.  I know I’m meant to be impersonal and professional, but that sick freak deserved it.”

I suppose he did.

He did deserve it; there are so many who didn’t.

Little parts of them are in my basement, bigger bits in the garden.

Tiny smears of them left on my kitchen knives, that man joining them.

If that police officer came back with proper sniffer dogs (these ones don’t seem to catch the scent) and a large digger, maybe he’d realise that I ‘deserved it’ too.

There are power tools in my basement, do you know that?

And pretty sizeable bits of tarp and plastic.

All very useful.

I wish I hadn’t moved house- I feel like I left parts of myself, or- to be honest- them behind.

Maybe I wasn’t the first guy that creep tried to kill but he wasn’t anything special to me either.  
Not the first. Not the last.  
I’m on thirty-five now.  
And I think this story needed to be told.

I did all the right things, fluids, diet, and he stayed in Stage 2 as recently as 5 weeks ago.  However, things were going downhill recently, as his weight dropped from 4 pounds down to 3 pounds over maybe 6 months.  

On Friday, he would not eat and was having trouble walking.  I took him to my urgent care vet on Sunday, who hospitalized him...blood test now showed Stage 3 kidney disease, very close to Stage 4, along with worsening anemia and now low glucose.  A scary result, but I hoped the treatment would stabilize him, he would eat and regain strength.

So last night, he was no better, not eating and even more unstable trying to walk.  The plan was a 2nd day of hospitalization...but when I carried him outside in the morning, he was gone.I took his body to the vet and will get the ashes, but he's gone.

He was literally my life.  I organized my day around taking care of him.  For a few years now, I would not travel because nobody could read his needs and help him as I could.  

I've been through grief before, but this seems different.  There was such a bond.  He was my ""velcro"" dog, small enough to go everywhere with me, and he always wanted to go with me, so I became the guy with the little dog at restaurants and coffee shops and even my dentist office and the lady who cuts my hair.  He would sit on my lap as she cut my hair.  He was like a part of me.  Maybe the best part of me.  He liked everyone, but he was overtly affectionate to the people he actually knew and loved, a pretty small circle.  And now, I reach for him next to me, for 10 years, he was always next to me, and he's not there.  I don't know how I go on, or if I even want to go on.  There are other dogs, but there is no other Mickey.

I am sorry for the length, but I am writing as a sort of therapy to push away the pain.  I know everyone here can understand.  Thank you.",4,1762793532.0,Petloss,1,0.84,False

1otiyts,https://www.reddit.com/r/pluribustv/comments/1otiyts/small_theory_on_the_virus_cycle/,Small theory on the virus cycle.,"I'm sure it's already been talked about, just wanted to say that maybe the hive mind is similar to a virus in real life. Where viruses need a host in order to reproduce, maybe the virus takes over a planet, uses the populace in order to replicate and set up a ""radar the size of Africa"" to ""infect"" the next planet. Where planets are like cells in real life and the virus behaves in a way similar to the [lytic cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lytic_cycle).

I thought this because at first infection, the people were behaving so seriously and methodically. Also, it doesn't seem that the virus takes care of people or respects them. The girl who flew in the plane must of been exhausted, which has a real effect on the body. But they just gave her a coffee and sent her off. Plus, maybe the humans feel ""good"", but their bodies may be degrading, like we haven't seen anyone sleep? To me this is evidence of the virus using its host in order to replicate or do some sort of agenda. And it's interaction with the MC is just it stalling her.

This theory seems reasonable but I do have a feeling it's wrong tho, it feels too obvious. My gut is saying that the virus maybe is benevolent, and just wants to spread in order to help life forms in the universe, or what it thinks is help.",1,1762793445.0,pluribustv,1,1.0,False

For my birthday this year, I specifically asked for no gifts/ food gifts if they must. My sister and stepmother both focused of food gifts, but neither could resist getting me a tchotchke or two. These went straight into a bag for donation. My mom sent me some beautiful coffee mugs, which I love. These still caused me so much stress, I had to take current mugs to donate because I have small cupboards and there was no room for new mugs. The mugs I already had were fine. How can I get over this feeling that anything new, even if I love it, is harmful to the environment. 

How can I reconcile these conflicting feelings? I really don’t want anything new and I also don’t want to ruin the holidays for others by being like this.

Exchanged socials and stuff planned everything the fire was there from both ends we decided to meet over the weekend yes the one that just went by🫠

We decided a place mutually convenient for both of us and finally settled on a nice cafe brunch sort of....met her she was absolutely stunning like 10x better in person. We talked, laughed shared momments etc everything looked like textbook perfect, but soon after the coffee meet ended and we went our ways since it was getting late. I thought she was the one and was feeling really warm and happy from within, but fate had something else in store idk why she became distant after that date and suddenly went all radio silence on me😭😭

I am feeling so sooo shattered what do I even do, can't seem to have the motivation to even get out of bed.

Entire Top Floor 2B/1B at 1B/1B Pricing! Spring & Summer 2026. Perfect for couples, families with kids, or anyone who simply wants a lot of space.

My boyfriend and I are moving abroad, so we are subletting our entire 2B1B top-floor apartment at Ridgemar Commons (3611 SW 34th Street, 32608) near Butler Plaza.

The sublease period can be from mid to late January to July 26th, 2026. The exact start date is negotiable. We will cover January’s rent, so you can move in and live rent-free until February, when you start paying rent.

I can confidently say that this is the BEST apartment we’ve ever lived in Gainesville compared with other communities we’ve lived in over the past two years (Theory Gainesville, The Enclave, 2nd Ave Centre). I wouldn’t move out if I didn’t have to!

They have the most helpful staff, and the maintenance service is reliable, smooth, and fast. The community also provides an outdoor pool and grills, a fully equipped fitness center, an Amazon Locker, and a large dog park for your furry friends. There are plenty of parking spots downstairs, and parking is completely FREE.

The apartment is very spacious, and each bedroom has a generous walk-in closet. The whole apartment is equipped with SMART FEATURES including a keyless smart lock, smart doorbell, and smart thermostat for enhanced security and convenience. We also installed LED light strips in the living room that can be controlled by phone. This is a top-floor unit (two-story building), so it’s quiet and bright. No roaches at all, and the carpet is only one year new. The unit comes unfurnished, but we are happy to provide all our furniture at a small additional cost, making it a true turn-key move-in! Includes: Queen bed, couch, coffee tables, smart TV, TV stand, dresser, desks, chairs, bookcase, shoe racks, and nightstand. Or you can pick the furniture you like during the room tour. Feel free to schedule a tour!

Rent is $1522/month for the entire apartment. Utilities are approximately $200/month (including internet), depending on usage.

The only thing we ask is that you complete the whole application process and sign the lease before November 30th. Otherwise, we’ll have to submit an early termination notice.

We did a deep dive in this category on the blog recently and I was surprised to find that there are some really good options out there. 

For review purposes, I started with OneNotary as it looked the most user friendly up front. This is my experience to date...

First off, setup was super simple. I uploaded my doc (a boring financial form), verified my ID with a driver’s license scan + selfie (took like 2 minutes), and then it matched me with a live notary. It’s basically like a Zoom call, except way more official. The notary walked me through everything, asked me the standard ID questions, and then I e-signed the doc while they “stamped” it digitally. The whole process was maybe 5 minutes tops.

Pros:

* Didn’t have to leave my house. Literally did this while sipping my morning coffee.
* Faster than waiting around at my bank for an appointment.
* Secure process, felt pretty legit. The notary was professional, not some random.  
* Got the notarized doc back instantly as a PDF with the seal + digital certificate.

Cons:

* Costs more than walking into a bank ($25 in my case). Not outrageous, but still.
* Tech issues could ruin your day if your internet sucks.
* Not every doc type is accepted (stuff like wills or court filings can be tricky).

Would I use it again? 100%. For anyone who just needs a standard form notarized quickly, it’s worth the extra $20–$30 to not burn half a day driving around. If you’re a “just go to the bank” person, fine. But if you like convenience (and hate errands), this is one of those services that actually does what it says.

Second anniversary of our brother’s death in combat.

I am at my parents’ house. It is in the middle of nowhere in a small village.
Not much is happening and you can hear the birds singing between the voices and laughter of my family.

The house is made of white stones with markings going back from World War 2.
Farmers, shepherds engraving their names with the year: 1942… 1908… 1941…

This former farm was built in the 19th Century and the tree in the middle of the property is probably 2 centuries old.
It lived through wars, seasons, and human lives. It stood high and proud. It still does.

⸻

I wake up early today. Everyone is still sleeping.
The sun isn’t up yet, I am cold.

I decided to sleep in the living room yesterday.
I knew I was going to wake up early and did not want to bother anyone upstairs.
Maybe I was afraid to have a nightmare concerning that upcoming anniversary.

I look through the big glass doors of the living room and see the huge linden tree.
2 centuries and it is still standing. Unbothered. Me, my existence, sleeping under his shadow.

I stand up and gather my running gear. I fold the bed sheets like the Army taught me.
I warm my muscle with vapo-rub and fill my CamelBak.

I am getting ready to run 20 kilometers.
It’s been a while since I did but I need to release the tension I feel.

⸻

I open the living room doors and leave them open.
I look up to the tree. I see inside its canopy and the shy sun rays piercing through the leaves.
I would love to levitate and stay inside that bubble made of leaves and wood.

My friend died 2 years ago. It was not an easy death. It was violent.

Thinking that, I close my eyes and embrace the cold morning.
I have to be grateful to feel something.
I know my other brothers are up too.

No need to call, no need to send texts. I know they are ready to run.

⸻

I walk to the gate at the end of the front yard.
Some family members are up and waving to me.
They have a surprised look on their faces and I can’t explain to them what I am doing right now.

I put music in my ears and I start running.
I focus on my breathing and my stride.
I don’t think much and I follow the route I plotted yesterday.

Soon, I am out of the village and in the middle of wheat fields.
The lone asphalt road cutting through forests and fields.

I go faster and I feel good.
I am alone under that giant blue sky.
I see a few does and their little ones looking at me from the fields.

I think about my brothers running in the middle of cities, on beaches, around a stadium.
To each their own but we run.
We run to honor our friend.
We run to express our feelings.

I run as fast as I can and I feel exhilarated.

⸻

I hit the 10 kilometers mark.
It is time to turn around.
I don’t feel pain in my legs or my lungs.
I am just part of that giant blue sky.
I feel happy to be able to run and live.

I scream.
A liberating scream.
A mix of happiness, sadness and maybe some madness.

I am alive.
I survived.

I run with a mix of sweat dripping from under my cap and maybe a few tears.
I run for him, for us and for me.

⸻

I am back inside the village and I keep up the pace.
I see the front yard gate and I wish I could run more.
I wish I could run to the end of the world.

My family looks at me closing the gate.
I don’t face them but I know they are watching me.

I sit in the tall green grass, under the warming sun.
I tell them I’m stretching but in reality, I am trying to get back to the real world.
I have to get back to them.

The linden tree is on top of me.
Standing more than 25 meters tall.

My family knows why this day is special to me.
We do not talk about it.
They know and that is about it.
I’m sure some of them don’t even know or care.
It is fine. They would not understand anyway.

⸻

After a long shower, I pour two whiskeys with no ice.
It’s early but I don’t care.
I head for the comforting shadow of the linden tree.
I look up to that green bubble.

I call my brothers and they also have whiskeys in their hands.
One for us, one for him.

We talk about him.
We laugh about stories involving poor choices, training, and war.
We laugh and I am drunk from a few sips after that run.
I feel the blood rushing to my cheeks.

I do not care.
I am alive.

My family is still drinking coffee and tea for breakfast and I smell like a distillery.

To end the call, we take turn saying a nice memory of our brother.
Simple, yet so hard.

We finish our glasses and we pour the remaining one on the ground.
I watch that liquid pour from the glass directly into the soil.
I see the drops forming a small pool on that dark soil.

The linden tree moves a bit in the wind.
He tasted the whisky of the fallen.

The linden tree will stand for a long time.
He will stand with our fallen.

1otikn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/PackAndGo/comments/1otikn8/best_tech_gifts_for_frequent_travelers/,Best Tech Gifts for Frequent Travelers,"I learned the hard way that tech gifts for travelers aren't about being flashy—they're about solving real problems.

Last November, I watched my phone die at 32% battery in the Frankfurt airport while my connecting flight got delayed three hours. No charger. No power bank. Just me, a dead phone, and absolutely no idea which gate I needed. That panicky feeling of being disconnected? Never again.

Here's what I've learned after countless flights, layovers, and ""why didn't I pack that?"" moments: the best tech gifts for frequent travelers are the ones that eliminate stress before it starts.

# 1. Noise-Canceling Headphones That Actually Work

**Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones** ($449) or **Sony WH-1000XM6** ($400)

I spent years thinking ""good enough"" earbuds would cut it. Then I tried proper noise-canceling headphones on a red-eye to Tokyo, and honestly, it felt like someone hit the mute button on the entire plane.

The Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones are stupidly comfortable—I've worn mine for 8-hour flights without that clamping headache. The noise cancellation is so good it's almost eerie. Engine rumble? Gone. Crying baby three rows back? Barely noticeable. They fold flat, come with a solid case, and the 24-hour battery life means you're not rationing charge like it's precious cargo.

Sony's WH-1000XM6 are the other heavyweight champion here. Slightly better sound quality if you're an audiophile, comparable noise cancellation, and they fold more compactly than the Bose. Both are excellent—pick Bose if comfort is your priority, Sony if sound quality matters more.

**The downside:** Both are expensive and bulky. If you're a minimalist packer, you'll feel them in your bag. But after one long-haul flight, you'll understand why people treat these like religious artifacts.

**Budget option:** The Bose QuietComfort Headphones (not Ultra) regularly drop to $199 and still deliver 90% of the experience.

# 2. A Power Bank That Doesn't Suck

**Anker Nano Power Bank (10,000mAh)** ($29) or **Anker 737 Power Bank (24,000mAh)** ($85)

Here's the thing about power banks: most people buy one that's either too small to be useful or so massive it becomes its own luggage item.

The Anker Nano 10K hits the sweet spot. It's about the size of a deck of cards, weighs practically nothing, and can fully charge most phones 2-3 times. The built-in USB-C cable is genius—one less thing to forget. I keep mine in my jacket pocket during flights and it's literally saved me dozens of times.

For longer trips or if you need to charge a laptop, the Anker 737 is worth the upgrade. At 24,000mAh, it's airport-legal (just barely—it maxes out the 100Wh limit) and powerful enough to charge a MacBook Pro. The digital display shows exact battery percentage, which sounds minor until you're calculating if you have enough juice to make it to your hotel.

**Real talk:** A $15 power bank will die on you eventually. Anker's warranty and reliability are worth the extra $10-15. I've had mine for two years of heavy travel and it still holds a full charge.

# 3. Luggage Tracker (Because Baggage Claim Anxiety Is Real)

**Apple AirTag** ($29) or **Tile Slim** ($25)

Last summer my checked bag went to Copenhagen while I went to Amsterdam. Watching that AirTag on my phone show my suitcase touring Scandinavia without me was both hilarious and deeply frustrating. But I knew exactly where it was, which kept me from completely losing it at the service desk.

If you have an iPhone, AirTag is the obvious choice. It taps into Apple's massive Find My network—nearly a billion devices worldwide—which means your tracker can ping off basically any iPhone that passes by. The precision finding feature is wild: your phone literally points you toward your lost item with arrows and distance measurements.

Android users or anyone who wants flexibility should grab Tile. The Tile Slim is credit-card thin, making it perfect for wallets or passport holders. Battery lasts three years (non-replaceable, unfortunately), and it works with both Android and iOS. The sound it makes is louder than AirTag, which matters when you're trying to locate something in a messy hotel room.

**Pro tip:** Buy a four-pack. One for checked luggage, one for your carry-on, one for your wallet, one for your keys. Trust me.

# 4. Universal Travel Adapter with Built-In Charging

**MOMAX 1-World 100W GaN Charger** ($76)

Before discovering these, I traveled with a regular adapter plus two wall chargers plus a power strip. Rookie move.

The MOMAX combines a universal adapter (works in 180+ countries) with fast charging ports—two USB-C, two USB-A. That means one device replaces four, and you can charge your phone, laptop, tablet, and smartwatch simultaneously from a single outlet. The GaN technology keeps it compact and prevents it from getting nuclear-reactor hot like older chargers.

I've used mine in Japan, Italy, Thailand, and the UK without issues. The slide mechanism for different plug types is satisfying in a weird way. And 100W of power means it can fast-charge even power-hungry laptops.

**Heads up:** It's not tiny (about the size of a baseball), and at $76 it's pricier than a basic adapter. But if you travel internationally more than twice a year, it pays for itself in convenience alone.

**Budget option:** MOMAX makes a 70W version for $60 with slightly fewer ports—still excellent if you don't need laptop-level charging.

# 5. Compact Tech Organizer

**Bellroy Tech Kit Compact** ($89)

I used to just throw cables in my backpack's front pocket like some kind of cave person. Then I'd spend 10 minutes untangling everything at airport security while people glared at me.

A dedicated tech organizer is one of those ""why didn't I do this sooner?"" purchases. The Bellroy Tech Kit has elastic loops for cables, mesh pockets for chargers and dongles, and a magnetic closure that actually stays shut. Everything has its spot, which means you're not frantically digging for that one USB cable when you need it.

It's also slim enough to slip into any bag without adding bulk. The materials feel premium (because at $89, they better be), and the zippers haven't failed after a year of aggressive travel.

**Alternative:** If Bellroy's price makes you wince, look at Anker's tech pouches ($20-30) or even basic cable organizers from Amazon. The specific brand matters less than having *some* system.

# 6. Wireless Earbuds for Quick Trips

**Apple AirPods Pro (2nd Gen)** ($249)

Sometimes over-ear headphones are overkill. Quick coffee shop work session? Running through the airport to catch a connection? That's when small wireless earbuds shine.

AirPods Pro have legit noise cancellation (not headphone-level, but impressive for their size), transparency mode for when you need to hear announcements, and they basically disappear in your pocket. The spatial audio is genuinely cool for movies on the plane.

Battery life is solid—about 6 hours per charge with ANC on, and the case holds multiple recharges. They're also one of the few earbuds that reliably work with both iPhone and iPad without connection drama.

**Android users:** Look at the Samsung Galaxy Buds3 Pro or Sony WF-1000XM5. Both are excellent and integrate better with Android devices than AirPods do.

# 7. Compact Portable Bluetooth Speaker

**Anker Soundcore Mini 3** ($18)

Not essential, but hear me out. Hotel rooms are often depressing. Having a small speaker transforms your temporary space—background music while you work, podcasts while you get ready, or just making FaceTime calls sound less tinny.

The Soundcore Mini 3 is cheap enough that losing it wouldn't ruin your day, sounds way better than it has any right to at $18, and the IP67 rating means you can use it by the pool without stress. It's about the size of a soda can and lasts 15 hours per charge.

**Real talk:** This is the gift that seems boring until someone actually uses it, then suddenly they're packing it for every trip.

# 8. Cable Management That Doesn't Suck

**Nite Ize Gear Ties (3-inch)** ($10 for 4-pack)

The least sexy recommendation on this list, but possibly the most useful. These bendable cable ties are reusable, colorful, and genuinely solve the ""tangled nightmare"" problem.

Loop them around your charging cables, use them to bundle headphones, attach them to your backpack straps. They're one of those ""costs $10, saves your sanity"" purchases.

# What Actually Makes a Good Travel Tech Gift?

After testing more gear than I care to admit, here's what separates useful gifts from stuff that sits in drawers:

**Solves a specific problem:** Dead battery, lost luggage, tangled cables—good travel tech addresses real pain points, not imaginary ones.

**Actually portable:** If it's too heavy or bulky to pack every trip, it won't get used. Period.

**Reliable:** Travel is stressful enough without your gear failing. Stick with brands that have solid track records.

**Multiple uses:** The best travel tech serves more than one purpose. A power bank that charges phones *and* laptops beats one that only does phones.

# A Few Final Thoughts

The best tech gifts aren't always the flashiest. Sometimes it's the $18 Bluetooth speaker that transforms every hotel room. Sometimes it's the $29 AirTag that provides peace of mind about checked luggage.

What matters is this: does it make travel less stressful and more enjoyable?

Because at the end of the day, frequent travelers don't need more stuff. They need solutions to problems they've experienced too many times—dead phones at crucial moments, lost bags, untangled cables, or just wanting to create a bit of comfort in unfamiliar places.

1otihf3,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1otihf3/how_much_is_my_fault/,How much is my fault?,"I (27M) met my situationship (27F) through Hinge around 6 weeks ago. We met for drinks and had an instant connection, where in the span of the last two months we’ve continued to have 10+ dates that were genuinely some of the most fun I’ve had in a long time. We have a running shared list in the notes app for date ideas and we’ve been crossing them off, from dinners, drinks, a haunted house, coffee, she works at a bartender and invited me to visit where she comped a 100$ check and we went out with her coworkers after. She would sleep over fairly often, whenever I drove we would hold hands or I would hold her leg, it felt pretty real to me. We did a double date with a friend of mine once. Never had a casual hookup with this much relationship esque activities. Our last date was last week where we went on a 24 hour trip, had a nice dinner, saw a show, slept over, had breakfast the next morning, the works. 

The problem started when I noticed she updated some of her hinge photos. I didn’t want to bring it up until I dropped her off the next morning after the trip. She gave wishy washy answer, saying “my sister wanted to see my profile and then made fun of my pictures” and when I asked if she was trying to meet more people, she said “not really”.

I didn’t love this answer, dropped the conversation, and texted her an hour later basically accusing her of not valuing our relationship, saying that I thought it was real but it was all in my head, that I don’t want a situationship or something casual, that we clearly want different things, and that it would be better we ended things here if that’s the case. 

In hindsight I started this convo very aggressive and accusatory. We’ve never had awkward moments or conflict prior to this and after reflecting more I’m pretty confident we were heading in the direction of a relationship (maybe I’m delusional still). I could be wrong, but I’m pretty sure we had a real connection.

She took two days to respond, saying she never meant to lead me on and that I’m right we do want different things. After this, I started thinking about it more and we never really defined what the terms “situationship” or “serious” mean”. In my head a serious relationship is exactly what we’re doing, but exclusive. I’m not sure if she has the same definition. 

I started spiraling at this point, ended up writing her a letter, touching on some of my favorite memories, why I like her, my definition of a serious relationship, where I see this going in the future, and dates I want to take her on. I had actually written her a letter maybe 3 weeks in with a similar structure because she mentioned off hand how meaningful that felt to her and she LOVED it. She did not love this letter lol. 

I was rushing / panicking and it wasn’t the most well thought out message I could have given. I still think it would have been fine except I used the words “im starting to fall in love” and that freaked her out. I got a text two days later, summarized as “I don’t feel like I’m falling in love, I enjoyed getting to know you and spending time with you, but this is too much too soon”

She unfollowed / removed me as a follower on insta, unmatched me on hinge, and left on read for 2 days now. She still has our Spotify playlist saved + collaborative note with date ideas on her phone, but I don’t have much hope here

There’s more context to our relationship but I feel like I made this situation much more complicated than it needed to be. I’m pretty confident she wasn’t seeing anyone else (I could be wrong). And I don’t think exclusively when we’re having unprotected sex is that crazy of an ask.

Anyone go through something similar? It’s hard for me to wrap my head around the idea that this short intense connection where we never really had conflict prior, barely communicate the issues, and then it fizzles out like this. 

I feel better about it by the day but I keep blaming myself and thinking about how I could have handled this differently

TLDR: need reccomendatios for a grinder that suits mainly espresso. 

I've been down the rabbit hole of grinders lately. I recently purchased a Gaggia Classic Pro Evo and have been making espresso and milk drinks for my wife on this for a few weeks. I'm looking to do the Gaggimate mod on this in the future. I used to drink pourovers and use an aeropress so I have been grinding on my 1zpresso J-Max currently however the results I'm having using fresh beans isn't how I would hope. My temp surfing routine with the machine is as per Lance Hendricks guide, and I feel ive got this down pretty well so far. 

I'm unsure whether flat burrs or conical is going to be best to suit what I am after. Basically around 12 or so years ago I ordered what I think was a cortado at a coffee shop in swiss cottage, London. It was probably the first time I ever had a coffee, and there was a very distinct nutty flavor to it. I wish I could remember or tell more however the shop assistant did have broken English, and being 16 at the time I just agreed to what she was asking.

So, I'm after reccomendatios around no more than £600. (The lower the better obviously) Also, available readily in England is ideal. As well as easy enough for my wife to use when I'm not around. (I'm aware that this is hard to fill). Can be single dose or hopper dosed.

Grinders I've looked at so far-
- The DF54/64 gen 2 and DF64V V2.
-Timemore 064s
-Niche Zero

No matter where I look I see positives and negatives for all the above. 

Appreciate any help given and sorry for the long post!

i intensely dislike, borderline hate our 10 year old corgi 50% of the time. 

i got him when corgis were the cool cute new dog. i admit it’s my fault i did not do a lot of research. i did not realize that as they age they become hyper attentive barking machines that screech at the drop of a pen. 

i can’t walk around our house without eliciting an ear splitting shriek. use ofANY household appliance (fridge, coffee maker, microwave, exhaust vent) causes him to screech. 

standing up from a desk. turning off the shower. god help us all if someone knocks on the door or if we have a visitor. me and my husband cannot talk above a whisper and i cannot laugh at a movie without elicit a flurry of ear splitting, window rattling barks. 

i am mentally and physically over it. my ears cannot take the sound anymore. once i hit my limit of the ear splitting screeches, he spends the evening in his cage with a blanket over it and a white noise playing to i can enjoy my evenings. 

i could never tell my husband this but i just want him gone most of the time. yes he’s cute and i cuddle with him and i would miss having him around. but if i could waive a magic wand and he never exist and no one would remember or judge me for it he would be out of my fucking life so quickly. 

everyone thinks it’s funny. everyone thinks it’s cute. EVERYONE DOWNPLAYS IT (of course a dog barks! it’s not that bad!) and i feel like i have no one who takes this seriously. i honestly feel like a prisoner and slave to making sure i do things in a way ther don’t elicit screeching. 

and no i never abuse or hit him. he’s been somewhat trained to stop barking if he starts into a flurry. but there is no way to stop his reactive screeching since it’s just one time outburst.",0,1762792227.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.11,False

We're a couple currently living in Delhi. We both originally belong to Haryana. We got married about 2 years ago, and life's been quite a ride since then!

After marriage, we shifted to Mumbai and worked together in a travel agency (yep, travel has always been our thing). Unfortunately, the company shut down, and we eventually moved to Delhi. Now he's still in the travel industry, working remotely, and she's running her own little cloud kitchen, something that's grown out of her love for food and experimenting in the kitchen

We both absolutely love traveling, café hopping, exploring new places, and just having good conversations over coffee or a long drive. We're here hoping to find some like-minded people, couples or individuals who'd love to connect, chat, share stories, maybe even plan a chill meetup sometime if vibes match

We're pretty easygoing, love to laugh, and are always up for discovering new things around Delhi or beyond.

If you decide to DM us, please send a small intro makes it much easier to start a conversation.

Perfect little escape…until the couple at the table next to me arrived.

At first, they were quiet, sipping their drinks, but after a few minutes, the tension exploded.

“Why do you always do this?!” she shouted, slamming her latte on the table so hard it almost spilled.
“I didn’t do anything wrong!” he snapped back, looking just as frustrated.

I tried to focus on my burger, thinking maybe it’s a small argument and they’d calm down…wrong. They started yelling accusations, bringing up personal stuff that I really did not need to know while eating fries.

Then it got chaotic. In the middle of gesturing wildly, the girl swung her bag behind her and it hit me square in the shoulder. My burger nearly fell off the tray, and I just froze for a second, holding my fries like a hostage while she kept yelling.

The grand finale? She grabbed the bag, spun around dramatically, and stormed out. He shouted something like, “Wait! Just listen to me for two seconds!” and everyone baristas, students, random adults was staring at them like it was a live soap opera.

By the time I finished my burger, I was exhausted from holding back laughter and shock, and also gently massaging the spot where her bag had smacked me.

I ask, how can you stand it?
Doesn't it haunt you?

You say, “I don't think about it”
While homes crumble under
a hail of bombs.
You smile, and want me to smile along.

“It isn't here”
“It's not our problem”
I know you believe that fiercely.
But it is here, rooted in all of us.

1oti6ki,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1oti6ki/and_with_that_my_tirzepatide_journey_comes_to_an/,And with that.. my tirzepatide journey comes to an end,"After (almost) a year and a half, I decided to quit cold turkey (also the same time that my stock supply ran out). Toward the end, my weight loss slowed down significantly and staggered. But my progress pictures show a different story as I kept a very consistent exercise routine. 

I’ve put in a lot of work on myself, both physically and mentally/emotionally in the last year and a half. So much time dedicated to dismantling habits that no longer serve my interests and creating new ones. 

I decided to not repurchase tirz while I came to the end of my  supply. It’s been about three weeks and what I’ve noticed? My BM are much more regular now. I’m not on any specific diet per se, but I am mindful of what I am putting into my body and how much of it. (almost) Everything in moderation. I will have that kitkat if I really want it. I do have cravings but I try to avoid them and will have a cup of coffee or put flavored electrolytes in my water (really loving Ultima lately). So, essentially it seems the same to me. 

With regard to my weight, my lowest on a glp-1 three weeks ago was 186. This morning I weighed 190. I’m pretty sure it’s mostly water weight with my menstrual cycle (came today, two days late), but also because I ate out last night around 10pm (not typical in my routine but I met up with some friends that are visiting). 

I wanted to share my experience with stopping a glp1 as it can look different for everyone. I’m only three weeks off of it and my body is still adjusting. It’s probably why my period came two days late this time. I am a little concerned that I will regain some of the weight that I lost but I’ve put in so much work creating new habits and have fallen in love with movement. So much so that I’m actually starting a yoga teacher training in a few weeks.

1. There’s no coffee “to go.” Romans drink it standing at the bar in about 30 seconds.
2. Bus timetables are works of fiction. You’ll learn patience - or buy a scooter.
3. Something is always “in restauro.” Scaffolding is basically part of the skyline.
4. Aperitivo often replaces dinner. They've even coined a word for it: apericena.
5. The bins have a life of their own. Sometimes they move, sometimes they vanish, usually they're overflowing - they're always a mystery.
6. In August, Rome is a ghost town. Population: 10 thousand waiters and countless hot, sweaty tourists.
7. Feelings on gelato run high: every Roman you meet will swear *their* gelateria is the best in town.

What other little surprises have you discovered in Rome?  
Which of these do you love, and which drive you mad?

Let’s make a list of the quirks that make Rome… Rome.",4,1762791621.0,MovingtoRome,0,1.0,False

I'm stressing out so hard rn, I am alone at my (dangerous) job (coworker on vacation) doing his job *and* my job, which includes new task that I'm scared to do, that if anything goes wrong there's no one here to help me. Also it snowed 6 inches last night and is still snowing now, making it even harder to work outside.  I'm so stressed out that I'm literally having trouble focusing my eyes and I'm shaking and on the verge of tears wtff.  Do I just have a bawl and let it go? Usually I just put on headphones and put on music to calm me down, but I need to be able to hear everything for this task and can't have music going. 

I'm trying to remind myself 'one step at a time, remember your safety steps' and 'slow is steady and steady is fast' but I'm procrastinating even getting started, I'm running around the shop in circles patting my pockets and going over the steps in my head over and over, running outside for smokes and wondering if this last half of my coffee will help or hurt me 😫 why did I have been in luteal *this* week",2,1762791606.0,PMDDxADHD,0,1.0,False
