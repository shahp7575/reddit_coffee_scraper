1iwrny7,https://www.reddit.com/r/twincitiessocial/comments/1iwrny7/guy_friends_in_the_twin_cities/,Guy friends in the Twin Cities,"I‚Äôd really like to make new guy friends that are genuine, respectful, and supportive; especially when it comes to mental health, body positivity, and being an ally to those within the üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà community.

I had some guy friends growing up, and a few in college, but there are only a couple that I still talk to; which, at most, is a message or two throughout the year. Currently, a majority of my friends are women, but as they get married or date, I see them less often. Plus, always being that third wheel gets old and depressing. lol

As well, I think why I gravitated more towards women friends is because I felt more comfortable being myself around them. I wasn‚Äôt typically into your traditional guy stuff‚Äîsports, the outdoors, cars. Additionally, I‚Äôm a short guy, and because of that, I was always kind of self-conscious throughout my years in school. Nowadays, I think there‚Äôs still some of that lingering around, but I‚Äôve also learned it‚Äôs not worth worrying about.

Anyways, I guess throughout those years, I feel like I‚Äôve missed out on those brotherly bonds that guys can make with each other. To be honest, while I do have an older brother, when I think of who I would have as my groomsmen, I come up blank; and to me, that‚Äôs pretty sad.

So, I guess here am. Trying to meet other guys that may also be in the same boat. 

I‚Äôm 35 years old and I would like to make at least one guy friend whom I can hang out with on the regular. If you enjoy sports, cars, and the outdoors, that‚Äôs ok! Haha Honestly, I‚Äôd be happy doing all those things if it means spending time with you. Things I enjoy: Coffee, going out for food/drinks, watching tv/movies, playing video games, I do but am still new to taekwondo, I like to lift weights but haven‚Äôt in a while, and I‚Äôd like travel more.

I live in a building complex with an elevator, a guard, two automatic double-door entrances and security cameras.

I've seen the footage. The driver simply drops the bag on the floor between the two doors (after the first door, but before the locked intercom door). They take a picture of the bag on the ground and simultaneously ring the apartment number. Then, they immediately pickup the bag and walk back to their car.

I've contacted GrubHub and they said that without proof they won't do anything except refund or re-order for me. It takes me ages, if I'll even be successful, to get CCTV footage from my building's administration, and I'm afraid that at one point if this keeps happening, GrubHub won't refund me anymore thinking I'm some scammy user.

Anecdote:

I've read on other posts on this sub that drivers are ""hungry"" or that its tip/wage related (not that it's an excuse). Even if that were true, the foods that were stolen from me this splurge and also previous times were ""*sexy*"" foods like fast-food, fries, iced coffee, etc. When it's a vegetable soup you can bet they don't steal it. I assume someone who doesn't have daily access to food would rather steal something filling and with actual substance?

I am assembling a Ikea Garnan√§s coffee table in green. https://www.ikea.com/ca/en/p/garnanaes-coffee-table-green-00556508/

The last step is to put some metal corner plates underneath the unit to screw in the wheels. There's some holes with plastic rivets in them. Most are fine but I have a couple where the plastic rivet is spinning so I can't screw in. Any tips?

I tried holding the plastic ring with a flat screwdriver but it barely works, and to assemble properly there will be a metal plate before the screw making it impossible to hold them down. Duck tape didn't work either. I want to get some glue but I'm not even sure how to get the glue in there.

Any tips please? I figure there must be a way to fix this without disassembling the whole thing and returning it. Should I try to break the plastic rivet and pull it out, fill with glue and toothpicks, and drill and start over? Anything simpler anyone can think of?",1,1740364577.0,IKEA,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    ‚Ä¢ Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    ‚Ä¢ The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    ‚Ä¢ Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  ‚Ä¢ Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    ‚Ä¢ It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    ‚Ä¢ Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    ‚Ä¢ Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    ‚Ä¢ Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

We weren't the best of friends, because in hindsight the friendship had undertones of sexual tension and we were just too awkward around each other. We had never flirted or touched, but we talked about anime for hours when we hung out. Very little texting. But he helped me move to his town for school, always treated me with kindness and I reciprocated his niceness. I had noticed him check me out couple times but I thought it was just instinctual because he was seeing another girl. I used to tell him a lot of stuff about my life and he always listened and shared stuff too. I thought our friendship was blossoming, we had too many things in common. One time he drove an hour just to come get a coffee with me. I was seeing another friend, but I had not gotten in a relationship yet. 

Then, few months in, he suddenly ghosts me. I was going through some anxiety episode at the time and told him that him ghosting me makes me more anxious, so he should communicate. I was so confused by his new persona. I apologized unnecessarily, not knowing what exactly had happened. After a lot of pleading, he sent a harsh message that he feels uncomfortable being my friend because *I am getting too close to him and we should never talk to each other again*. I was very hurt and told him so, and he replied with a deflective message that his intention was not to hurt me, he thinks we are incompatible as friends. We haven't talked since. He looks away if we cross each other's path.

I'm sure he cared about me, and I had feelings for him that I only realized after we stopped being friends. Idk why he acted so harsh and knowingly hurt me, its unbelievable. I almost think he had strong feelings for me too, but how can a man who has feelings for you, hurt you so badly and end the friendship, and never even nod at you as you cross his path? Am I delusional? Did our bond mean nothing to him? I'm pretty sure I never did anything to hurt him. What am I missing? ",1,1740364079.0,AskMenAdvice,14,0.67,False

1iwrds5,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1iwrds5/i_think_my_wife_saw_something_in_the_forest/,I think my wife saw something in the forest,"
How long does grieving last? I asked myself every single day for almost 3 years since my wife disappeared, and I never got an answer. The reminder that I was alone came every time I woke up and went to bed. Eventually, the reality sets in and I start to get used to eating alone, brushing my teeth alone, grocery shopping alone, and just being alone. I thought enough time had passed that I didn't have to ask myself that question anymore until the day I got a phone call from the nursing team who took care of my mother-in-law. Denise, the old lady, was planning on moving herself into a nearby nursing home, but now it sounds like she had too, passed.



When I arrived at their home I was met by one of the nurses who had taken care of Denise. She tried to leave quickly, not wanting to stay around the house long. We had a small conversation about where everything was in the home, and how most of the things inside were packed up and ready for storage, and then were given a set of keys for the house, each labeled with the rooms inside.



I tried to ask for more details, but all the nurse gave me was a passing chuckle as she turned to go to her car, getting inside and driving away without another word. It was a reasonable response when it involved anything that had to do with Denise. The old lady was going on 80 and was unbearable to be around. The last time I had spoken to her most of our conversation was loud coughing and nonsense.



The old house smelt like a hospital. Cardboard boxes were stacked randomly around the home with a thin layer of dust blanketing each surface. The TV and larger furniture stayed unpacked, only covered in a layer of plastic wrap. I was married to my wife for 5 years before she vanished, and I don't recall ever being in her childhood home. The old house sat in a suburban row of homes, all facing away from the tree line leading into the dense woods of the Pacific Northwest.



I stuffed the keys into my pockets and carefully squeezed between the stacked boxes. Small framed pictures of my wife at various ages still hung along the walls and sat across the small coffee table. I guess Denise wanted to take these in her bag, or maybe, like me, it was difficult to let her go.



With no one left in the family, the responsibility fell on me to take care of what was left of their belongings. I figured I would get the boxes to storage and clean the rest of the house before deciding what to do with it. I loaded a couple into my car, staring at the dishes and kitchenware, before stumbling on a pile of boxes with her name written across them.



‚ÄúGwen‚Äù



I read to the silent house. With a long deep breath, I carried the boxes to the coffee table and opened them. Inside were articles of clothing, old bound notebooks, photo albums, and school memorabilia. I flipped through them, and seeing her on every page brought tears. Her smile lit up each sun-faded page, and each wood frame she was captured in threatened to set on fire with her warmth. These boxes were going to stay with me.



I dried my tears and kept going, wanting to see more of her. I moved away a pile of old clothes and notebooks when my hand met something hard and hollow. Buried at the bottom of one of the boxes, were a hefty bag of small CDs, and a handheld video camera. I pulled them out and immediately went to turn it on. Unsurprisingly, the old thing wouldn't turn on, and the battery compartment was corroded shut with the old batteries still inside. I wrestled with it in the kitchen with a butter knife and got it opened and cleaned, then with the double As from the TV remote, got the thing to switch on. I inspected the camera again, excited to get it working, and saw it had a name written in marker on the side.



‚ÄúGwen‚Äù



I shuffled through the CDs, each labeled with a date, a few not. The first was for her 8th birthday, the small red-haired girl's face was right up in the camera lens, peering in with her bright steel blue eyes. She let out an excited squeal and ran to hug her parents, thanking her mom and dad for the expensive gift. I guess filmmaking had always been her passion. Her father responded with something unintelligible, and a heavy cough before he left the frame. I had never met the man when he was alive, and she never talked much about him. A moment later he returned with a big birthday cake, and then the three ate it together. The rest of the CD was just them eating before shutting off randomly. The old CDs didn't have that much storage, each having only about 20 minutes of memory.



I spent the next few hours going through her childhood. Several moments in the videos I recall her telling me about, late nights when we would lay in bed and talk until sunrise, other moments just small silly things a child with a video camera would film. Her father eventually showed up less and less in the videos, his cough worsening every time until he was no longer in them. For a long while the videos stopped, a large year-long gap before I saw her face again. Her smiles were never the same, she talked less, and some videos were just her talking about her day to her father and writing silently in her notebooks. Eventually, the pile of memories grew smaller and smaller, and when I almost reached the end of the dated discs, I decided to take a look at one without any date on it.



Heavy breathing interlaced with the crackle of the built-in microphone blasted through the tiny speakers, filling up the empty home more than everything else that night. The screen was dark, with only a small light coming from the left corner of the video. The lens stuttered and focused, eventually I was able to make out a line of trees and a street light, but the image was still blurred. It stayed focused on the dark woods for another moment before the camera was pushed forward, hitting a glass surface before it struggled to focus once again, the heavy breathing of my wife still close to the microphone.



I leaned in as if it would help the video focus, the blurry tree line being barely visible in the dark. Between the breaths of my wife, I could hear the camera force itself to focus, sharpening itself until the woods got steadily more and more visible. The camera stayed like that for 18 minutes, glued in position, and so did my wife. My eyes stayed trained on the trees just like she was in the video, watching for any movement at all, only leaving the treeline to check the timer on the video. It got to 19 minutes, and then as it slowly reached its end something shifted in the trees. The video ended, blinding me with the harsh blue menu of the settings screen.



Immediately I replaced the disk with another unmarked one. The next one was during the day, She stood just at the edge of the woods, camera raised and pointed towards the thick darkness created by the trees. The normally tranquil sounds of birds and nature in the background were sometimes interrupted by a heavy cough. Each time the camera fell for a moment I imagined she tried to stifle her cough. I watched again to the end of this video, all 20 minutes of just the camera pointed into the woods, but nothing happened.



The following four undated videos also showed nothing, just my wife, at various points and locations around her house, filming the woods for twenty minutes. The audio was always just background noise, coughing, and the mechanical whirl of the camera's focus. On the last dated one, I could see her reflection in the window as she filmed.  
She sat in the kitchen, the camera pointed towards the window above her sink, and the tree line beyond her yard. She was probably about 15 or 16 at this point, looking just like the first time we had met in high school. The camera tried to focus again on the woods, zooming between her reflection and the tree line. She let out another cough, this time just a brief one, and then opened a bottle of pills, swallowing them dry before letting the camera roll to its end. I had run out of CDs.



I stood from my spot on the ground and turned towards the kitchen window. It was now nighttime, making the darkness of the treeline even more oppressing than it was a few moments earlier on the screen. I stood and stared for a moment like she did, trying to scan the dark with my eyes but the trees stayed the same.



With a shudder, I pulled the blinds down to shut the window and made my way back to the with the help of my phone light. There were no more videos. I carelessly dumped out the rest of the boxes with her name on them across the floor and found nothing. Realizing what I'd done to what I had left of my wife I started to mournfully repack her items neatly into the boxes when I accidentally kicked something across the ground.



Her notebooks. I picked them up and laid them across the coffee table. There were only 3 of them, one of them a locked toy Barbie notebook that I wasn't going to get open unless I smashed the thing and the other two old leather bound style books. I carefully unwrapped the straps around them and flipped through the weathered pages, mostly filled with bits of writing and drawings.



Across the two available notebooks, her art style visibly improved and she wrote less and less. Like the videos, the drawings were about her and her parents. Unfortunately, they were almost exactly like the videos, chronicling and recording how ill her father eventually got more and more ill. The drawings and entries transitioned from them getting ice cream, hiking, and summer barbecues to hospital visits, sitting on their back porch, and looking into the woods. Then it was just the woods. The second half of her third notebook was just pages and pages of the trees, and nothing more, until the last two pages.



The graphite of the pencil was aggressively forced into the paper, splaying out an image of the tree line into the last two pages of her notebook. I ran my fingers along each tree and could feel them etched into the page, the black powder left behind by her pencil so long ago still stained my fingertips. In the middle of the page, done by what I assumed was an eraser trying to remove the forest from the notebook, stood a gaunt figure towering over the trees.



I closed the notebooks and set them back in the box and sealed them once again. I turned on every light in the house, first the entire ground floor, before making my way to the upstairs. I wanted to snuff out every single dark corner of this home to chase away a fear I refused to acknowledge. I shifted through the key chain in my pocket, entered every room, and turned on every light until I reached the locked door at the end of the hallway. I had one key left, one with her name written on the small tag that clung to it.



‚ÄúGwen‚Äù

My hand reached for where the light switch should be but couldn't find anything. I opened the door wider so that the light from the hallway could spill into the room enough for me to see.

1iwrcem,https://www.reddit.com/r/zoloft/comments/1iwrcem/wow_caffeine_sucks_now_update/,Wow caffeine sucks now (UPDATE),"

I've been on zoloft since October and I used to have a celcius every. Single. Day. 

Rn now im on week 13 of being on 100mg. It so far has been a great journey. Today I made a mistake. I thought I could have another celcius (I've been mostly caffeine free the whole time) and I was like sure why not. well after about an hour of drinking about a half of one i felt like I was going to jump out of my skin. The feeling was so bad. I work a desk job processing email request and I couldn't focus. I was just anxious and my heart just felt jumpy. 

I couldn't focus correctly the rest of the day. And my appetite was gone.  I had only eaten a banana by 5 pm. Needless to say I think I'm done with caffeine. And maybe it's for the best. 

Just had to put it out there. 

Zoloft is better than having a celcius  that barely gave me oomph anyways. 

UPDATE: for those who is wondering I stopped taking my B complex vitamin the day after original post (10 days ago) I went and saw my  parents who are huge coffee drinkers I had a cup or two while there. 

My insights is that I was overdoing my B vitamins with the celsius which can increase flushing. I still think I'm going to lay off the caffeine but it's nice to know what caused me to jump out of my skin

Thank you everyone for the insight and I hope everyone has a good week!",1,1740363839.0,zoloft,0,1.0,False

It shouldn‚Äôt be acceptable for a man to bother women when she‚Äôs out and about just trying to go about her day at the coffee shop or park, or out at the bar with friends.

I think cold approaching, approaching and chatting up random women you don‚Äôt know, is no longer acceptable or becoming less acceptable because it‚Äôs just not appropriate.

The optimal places for men to meet women outside of college are online dating or hobby groups. That‚Äôs where men should stick to, in my opinion. 

Even taking classes such as cooking classes aren‚Äôt advisable because many women are just trying to learn and enjoy the activity, they don‚Äôt want to be hit on by some desperate man.

Trying to strike up conversation with women at the park or on the street, is both ineffective, displays entitlement to her time, and is intrusive of her space. 

It‚Äôs better men leave women alone and approach in socially acceptable places- dating apps and hobby groups.",0,1740363820.0,PurplePillDebate,24,0.45,False

1iwran5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1iwran5/i_keep_finding_handprints_in_impossible_places/,I keep finding handprints in Impossible places ( Retry),"Hey everyone I posted a few days ago my story i wrote asking for critique. I got none. But that's fine I just took it as not good enough to criticize lol. But I added to the original and made it better in my eyes. Hopefully I'll get feed back this time.

Story: 

Yes, the title is accurate; for awhile now, I've been, finding a single handprint somewhere I can't reach. It's right-handed; that's literally all that I know.¬† I've found prints made from various materials and peculiar places.¬† The ceiling is always the weirdest spot; it's really freaky. I can't explain why or how this is happening. It's not bothering me to the point I can't live life, but I'm getting really tired of getting spooked.

It all started after my grandfather killed himself, I know we've grieved enough already. My mom had told me asphyxiation was the cause, so he hung himself. PTSD is a bitch.
"" His time in the war was very rough honey. You know he never even wanted to go."" She told me the morning we found out.
¬†"" Tried running from that draft and ended up with a blown arm."" She sat there rubbing his prosthetic hand, holding the wooden fingers like he did when she was a kid. I could tell it brought her comfort, a way to have him here still. But it hurt way more than anything, tears stained and flowed down her cheeks. But she surprised me when she asked if I could take it home with me. I didn't like it. We didn't have much of a relationship, he spent a lot of his time cooped up in his apartment. Away from us only being seen when we would pick him up for Christmas. Even then, he sat away from us, his eyes constantly wandering. It always unsettled me, like he was tracking something. 

I'm a sucker and I'd do anything for my mom. So, despite my knee-gut reaction towards it, I accepted. She thanked me, saying
""As much as I love him, it's more of a reminder of his suffering. But maybe it can bring you two closer in some way. I mean after all-"" she was cut off by a knock on the door. It was a quick and rapid three knocks, scared the shit outta me. My mom ran over and swung it open, stuck her head out. Weird. She turned back to me giggling to herself.
"" Those kids and their games."" She said to herself. After that, her mood was strangely calm; I figured it was honestly that sick part of us that was kinda relieved he was gone. Not in spite but in that selfish desire we all have. My mom took care of him constantly, being his only daughter; she took pride in being his baby girl. But when he really went downhill, you could see how much it cost her in her eyes alone. We hugged and I began my journey back to my house. It was a good 20-minute drive through the valley of California. During it, though, I thought I kept hearing that same knock; I couldn't pinpoint where it was coming from. Inside my car or outside on my back door.

When I finally got home I just tossed the box with Grandpa in it into my hall closet. I know it's rude and all, but I didn't care at the time, and honestly I just wanted to have it outta my sight. I wanted to cook with peace of mind; I'm a cook for my friend's restaurant nearby, so cooking is my own form of meditation. And honestly, I needed to relax a little, I thought I might make my mom something like cake. Kill two birds with one stone, a gift for her and me. I was collecting up my ingredients, ya know mise en place. I was grabbing my container of flour when those three knocks echoed in my house. I jumped and spilled the flour on the floor and counter; I turned to grab my broom. As I cleaned a sense of fear washed over me, like my body sensed danger I couldn't. As I got up to finish what was left. My heart sank, my stomach ached the feeling of vomiting from overwhelming fear sank deep. The flour was smeared around and a handprint sat in the middle of it all.

I don't know why but I called out
""H-h-hello? Who the fuck is in my house!""¬† I yelled in an attempt for intimidation. The Silent response was better at it than me. I grabbed my kitchen knife and began a slow walk through my home. Walking through my living room finding specks of flour were on the floor and they led to my room. The darkness of it making it foreign territory to me. I stood in my living room staring down that hall, past the closet, into the void. I was there with my fist clenched and shaking. I was too scared to move, I'm not a fighter. My body wanted to run, but I was too scared to move. I heard a crash in my room that made me jump dropping the knife. 
"" You fucking idiot."" I told myself as I bent down to pick it up my eyes never moving from the door.

But I stupidly grabbed the blade of it and sliced my fingers, my eyes darted towards the pain and in my peripheral I saw it. My damn cat smoky. He was covered in flour and his fur was all messed up. I finally calmed down and finished cleaning up his mess. Patched my hand up and got ready for bed, I decided against the cake. Mom seemed happy enough besides. I flipped the light on seeing my vent cover on the ground. Smoky must have gotten spooked in there and shook the wall. I picked it up and wiped the flour off
 
As I laid down in bed though I thought I heard those echoing knocks again. I brushed them off and¬† fell into slumber. I woke up that next morning well rested as ever forgetting the whole scare that night. But as I stretched in my bed I looked up mid yawn and saw flour on my wall. I thought Smoky must have jumped up when the vent fell. I fixed it up and was getting ready for my day, the best way to start for me. A hot shower. Tried turning on the fan but it just wasn't kicking on. 

While cleaning up once again those knocks again echoed, I assumed someone was at my door. Maybe Mom was here to cry some more, like the shock of yesterday was finally over. I washed off and shut the shower off. Opening the curtain to the thick steam my bathing created. I stood there drying off and nearly fell back into my shower. A handprint was on my mirror. I stared at it for a good second before getting up to look closer. I placed my hand over it, my hand was bigger not by much but bigger. Maybe I leaned on the glass while getting ready to shower. I mean it was the only thing that could make sense 

I quickly started getting dressed, still a little spooked by everything. Maybe I was just stressing about Grandpa. Maybe this maybe that was all I can ever come up with, I'm never certain on shit. Three knocks again I could hear them better, echoing though the vent. I exited the bathroom and rushed to my front door. Passing Grandpa. I opened it and sure enough there was my Mom.

She was there teary eyed but still smiled when I opened the door. 
""Hey honey, sorry for just dropping by."" 
""As if you need to apologize."" I told her. 
She sat down at the kitchen table, I made her some coffee. She thanked me as she took the mug from me.
"" Much needed baby, I was just up all night going through memories. Found that old box of photos from when you were real little."" She giggled.
""Anything with me and Grandpa?"" I asked
"" Only one from when you were born."" She said as she grabbed her phone, beginning to swipe through the photos. I couldn't help but exclaim,
""Holy shit!"" As she swiped past an image of me in a military uniform. But I was never in the military plus this photo was very old looking. 
"" Oh yeah! I never really noticed before."" She held the phone up next to my head. 
"" You're a spitting image of your Grandfather! Oh hoot your grand dad's old war buddies would get a kick outta that. They'll probably freak at the funeral."" She giggled 

I don't know what was with my mom, her emotions were everywhere it seemed. It was freaking me out bad, it felt like she was forcing herself to be sad. I know that makes no sense at all but her happy side came so quickly and easily. And when she was sad it was only in the beginning of the conversation. My alarm went off on my phone while we were chatting, completely forgot to finish getting ready to open up the restaurant. 

"" Hey mom give me a sec,"" I said turning off my alarm.
""Just gotta grab some stuff.""¬† I got up and jogged to my room looking for my name tag and apron. I always misplaced my stuff so I was looking for quite a bit. And as I was looking I heard a door slam hard. Made my ears ring. I quickly ran back out and found my mom gone. I went to call her but saw she texted me.

""Had to run sorry! Love ya!"" 
""Well fuck mom you don't gotta slam my door."" I thought to myself. She had done it so hard that the closet opened up a little. I went to close it and saw a little hole in the wall. I moved the door open and noticed the hole was from the handle. Did Mom really swing my closet open that hard and why? It's not like she needed anything from there. Then while shutting the door, thinking about what I had to buy to fix this shit. I saw the box with the prosthetic was gone.

Mom said she didn't have it, I know I couldn't have miss placed it. I only lose small things like my keys or my phone. So then where the fuck is it guys, can anyone explain that? But that was all just the start from there on I kept finding them. The hand prints. First the mirror then when I was cleaning I found some up in corners on my ceiling made of dirt and dust. One morning there was one on the window I sleep next to! It was just smudged right there, and I know it was in my house cause it was like all the rest of them. A smaller size than me and right handed. 

But tonight has been the worst of it all. It's why I'm here why I'm asking for help, for answers maybe. I'm in my room the doors locked. I just wanted to bake a cake again. I just wanted to bake, but the fucking knocks. They don't stop either and they were persistent tonight. And I went to grab my flour again and it was open and prints covered my pantry walls. I gasped and heard the knocking again. It bellowed through my house and ran towards my room. But the knocking was coming from the darkness of it. 

The sensation of fainting ran over me and with it I stumble ran to my bathroom locking the door behind me. I shakily took my phone out and tried to call the cops. I don't know what was happening, but my phone was glitching out way too much to do anything at all. Androids. They aren't too reliable. All I could do was hide out. My bathroom didn't have windows I couldn't go anywhere but out past that door of safety. 

Then whoever was in my house started knocking on the door. Three rapid knocks. Pause. Repeat. Then the pauses became shorter with each minute, becoming a nonstop stampede in my head. After ten minutes, the knocking stopped ; I heard the door knob jiggle softly, then that silence again. I'm not proud but I sat there in my bathtub for a good hour or so before I even considered getting up. Stayed there so long my phone died in my pocket. I reluctantly unlocked the door and pulled it towards me, letting it swing past and smack into the bathroom. Nothing was there, the lights were all off. And no one was there but me. I sighed still shaking, grabbing the knob to close the door, but my hand slipped off. I recognized this feeling; there was flour in my hand. I tried to turn the light on but hit my ac switch. And when it kicked on, it blew from the vent. Flour.
I'm scared, alone in my home, my room. I'll update in the morning. There's knocking on my walls right now. 
Im scared and want to sleep.

5. BDC Parfum: It‚Äôs a classic on this sub. Personally my favourite concentration for the opening lemon zest and performance.

6. Herod: Smoky but not intoxicating so paired with smooth vanilla/cinnamon. 

7. Code Parfum: Really smooth masculine and clean iris. 

8. LNDL Bleu Electrique: Performs better than the og for recent formulations and has a nice fresh touch to it. 

9. Y EDP: Synthetic but clean/sweet green apple with aromatic sage in the background. People pleaser. 

10. Noir Extreme EDP: Unique Kulfi note with a nice sweet but not overly powerful drydown. 

11. Luna Rossa Sport: Best of the line imo. Takes the edt and dials back the metallic-ness of it and adds in a bit of vanilla so it‚Äôs easier to wear. Lavender bomb. 

12. Spicebomb EDT: Best of the line alongside extreme imo. This one isn‚Äôt as sweet but still has enough to be sweet/spicy. 

13. SWY Intensely: It‚Äôs a sugar bomb pretty much. Prefer it over TMW since it ain‚Äôt as sweet. 

14. Dior Homme 2020: Masculine, clean, fresh spicy woods. 

15. L.12.12 Blanc EDT: Surprisingly good, really clean and fresh.Affordable as all hell too. 

16. Honey and vanilla bomb. Personally find it a bit too sweet but it PERFORMS and seems to be the most well liked by others. 

17. Dior Sauvage Elixir: A bit of a saffron bomb off my skin but a nice dark mature fragrance that can be a bit too strong. 

18. Jazz Club: boozy, smoky, subtly vanilla. 

19. AHSEE: Sharp smelling I in the beginning but with an amazing mint note that dries down to a spicy sweet fresh vanilla.

20. Bitter Peach: Wacky ass peach.  It‚Äôs hit or miss tbh. 

21. TDH Parfum: A stronger woodier twist on the DNA. Honestly love the smell of it but it‚Äôs a bit more on the mature end of things.

22. Luna Rossa Ocean Parfum: Wood bomb that has an amazing drydown tho the opening is a bit of a mess. 

23. Luna Rossa Ocean: Surprisingly really good, one of the better ‚Äúblue‚Äù scents out there imo but doesn‚Äôt last.

24. Coffee Break: Nice floral lavender drydown that isn‚Äôt offensive. Wished it had more coffee behind it though.

25. 1 Million Lucky: Synthetic, masculine, sweet, hazelnut. 

26. Khamrah Qawha: Really strong and sweet take on the DNA with a mild coffee note that makes it a bit more masculine. 

27. Turathi Blue: Fresh, sweet, but kind of synthetic. 

28. Explorer: Not a huge fan of aventus DNA but this seems to be the best of the ‚Äúcheap‚Äù versions. ",6,1740363111.0,Colognes,1,0.88,False

It‚Äôs two days back after my very first trip to New Orleans, my first Jazz & Heritage Fest, first walk through the rain in the French Quarter, first drunken night on Bourbon Street, and I still feel like I‚Äôm trippin‚Äô.¬†¬†

Even though no hallucinogens were actually consumed, I can‚Äôt shake my craving for those mysterious mossy stone courtyards, canopied by creamy white magnolia blossoms, cradled inside glossy green/almost black leaves, hidden pearls tucked above ornate French pastry shops, pastiche garlands decorating walls like wedding cakes.¬†¬†I want to be back at the best dive bar ever, singing¬†*Wild Horses*, arm-in-arm with total strangers, as we declare ourselves ‚Äú*Brothers from Another Mother‚Äù*¬†and ‚Äú*Sisters from Another Mister‚Äù* intensely connected to all of humanity.¬†¬†

The city of New Orleans is tuned to a different frequency, a different vibration in space and time, and life is as it should be‚Ä¶ fun, loose, and free, lived by the Creole motto:¬†***‚Äúlaissez les bons temps rouler****‚Äù or* ***‚Äúlet the good times roll‚Äù****.*¬†¬†People between the Mississippi River and Lake Pontchartrain are open to anything unafraid, experiencing each moment fully engaged, supported by the roots of eight-hundred-year-old oak trees festooned with purple, green, and gold beads.¬†¬†

Meaningful conversation and humor is found in every exchange ‚Äì whether the kind woman from Slidell, and her proud husband, describing how each spring she literally saves hundreds of Monarch butterflies, collecting eggs and hatching them inside their home safe from freeze, before releasing Mother Nature back into the world; or the seasoned old black man working hard behind *Felix‚Äôs Oyster Bar*, delivering fresh racks of glasses to Holly the bartender, along with one of the best pickup lines ever, when he asked her sister:¬†¬†¬†

**‚ÄúIs your daddy a beaver? ... Because he built a DAMN!!!!‚Äù**¬†

Street corners get crossed enthusiastically, never knowing what oddity, mystery, or incredible talent might be around the next - but whether it‚Äôs a guy drinking beer through a giant Scooby Doo head, a man sprawled out next to trained (drugged?) housecats leashed to carpet stands, or the cowboy-rocker on top of a pickup just¬†*killing it*¬†with faithful black dog by his side, there‚Äôs a strong likelihood it‚Äôs a sight you‚Äôll only see in New Orleans.¬†

At the *Annual Jazz & Heritage Festival*, wandering between panels of sweet honeysuckle vines and muddy rows of food vendors, I was beckoned to large and small stages of overlapping funk, blues, gospel, classic rock, and indigenous rhythms like a modern-day Woodstock.¬†¬†Young, old, black, white, beautiful, strange, local, international, everyone there to experience the wonder of life and be moved by the power of music.¬†¬†In the gospel tent wrinkled women in fancy sunhats stepped in time behind spry men in shiny tracksuits, committing to ‚Äú*be the change‚Äù*¬†for *Reverend J‚Äôai Reed*; and over at the main stage, a tumbling sea of sun-kissed people let their freak flags fly, (as well as giant foam pork chops on poles) locked in tight to *Dumstaphunk‚Äôs* incredible horn section, as *Gary Clark Jr.‚Äôs* mirrored sunglasses reflects the spectacular visual in real time on the big screen.

But just when I thought New Orleans couldn‚Äôt get any better it did, and I am still dumbfounded by my lucky chance encounter with greatness in the black and white doorway of the *Swig-n-Swine*.¬†¬†I suppose every prodigy starts somewhere, and that's where ***Ryan Hall***, a local guitarist from around the Quarter, throws down the¬†*best of the best songs, but better than you‚Äôve ever heard them played*, as one after another person stops to stare at the sweet kid, carefully bending the notes with all his heart, and the most legit skeeeeeeeeelz you‚Äôve ever heard.¬†¬†He taps into some kind of magic, the kind that gives you chills, and I couldn‚Äôt possibly move on from that bar on Bourbon Street, not as long as he was willing to keep playing and blowing our minds, sometimes holding his instrument over his head, sometimes behind his back, every request a mashup of Jimi, Stevie, and Kurt Cobain.¬†¬†Big words I know, but New Orleans gospel preached true nonetheless.¬†¬†

That weekend changed me alright, and even though life was really good before New Orleans, now it‚Äôs better.¬†I‚Äôm back in the flow of the Universe, swimming with music and love, refusing to go back to a rut of Netflix and chill.¬†¬†I‚Äôm going to manifest my destiny by jumping fearlessly into the second half of my life.¬†¬†I‚Äôll take a chance on that invention idea, self-publish my novel, and be back in the Quarter to sip frozen coffee at Molly‚Äôs soon.¬†¬†Thanks for the¬†*lagniappe*¬†New Orleans*.*

1iwqzo2,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_johnsmithmath89/comments/1iwqzo2/surprising_reasons_why_white_coffee_is_good_for/,Surprising Reasons Why White Coffee Is Good for You,"# Introduction

White coffee is gaining popularity among coffee lovers for its unique taste and potential health benefits. Unlike traditional roasted coffee, white coffee is made from beans that are roasted at a lower temperature, preserving more of their natural nutrients. But what exactly makes white coffee good for you? Let‚Äôs explore the surprising reasons why white coffee might be a great addition to your daily routine.

# What Is White Coffee?

White coffee is not just regular coffee with added milk or cream. It is made from coffee beans roasted at a lower temperature (typically around 325¬∞F) compared to traditional coffee, which is roasted at 450¬∞F or higher. This lighter roasting process retains more of the coffee‚Äôs natural compounds and results in a nutty, slightly sweet flavor with a higher caffeine content.

# Nutritional Value of White Coffee

Since white coffee is roasted at a lower temperature, it retains more of its natural antioxidants and beneficial compounds. Some key nutrients found in white coffee include:

¬†

**Chlorogenic acids**¬†‚Äì Powerful antioxidants that may support heart health and weight management.

**Caffeine**¬†‚Äì Provides a natural energy boost and enhances mental alertness.

**Polyphenols**¬†‚Äì Help reduce inflammation and protect cells from damage.

**Essential minerals**¬†‚Äì Such as magnesium and potassium, which support overall health.

# Surprising Health Benefits of White Coffee

# 1. Higher Antioxidant Content

White coffee contains more chlorogenic acids than dark-roasted coffee. These antioxidants help combat oxidative stress, which can reduce the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and cancer.

# 2. Boosts Energy and Mental Focus

Due to its lighter roasting process, white coffee retains a higher caffeine content compared to regular coffee. This means it can provide a stronger energy boost, improve focus, and enhance cognitive performance.

# 3. Supports Weight Loss

The chlorogenic acids in white coffee may help regulate blood sugar levels and improve metabolism, making it a great choice for those looking to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.

# 4. Gentler on the Stomach

White coffee is less acidic than traditional dark-roasted coffee, making it a better option for people with acid reflux, sensitive stomachs, or digestive issues.

# 5. Improves Heart Health

Studies suggest that polyphenols and antioxidants in white coffee may help lower blood pressure, reduce inflammation, and promote overall cardiovascular health.

# 6. May Reduce the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

The compounds found in white coffee have been linked to improved insulin sensitivity and better blood sugar regulation, which can lower the risk of developing type 2 diabetes.

# 7. Supports Brain Health

White coffee‚Äôs high antioxidant content may help protect against neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer‚Äôs and Parkinson‚Äôs by reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in the brain.

# 8. Enhances Mood and Reduces Stress

Caffeine in white coffee stimulates the production of neurotransmitters like dopamine and serotonin, which can improve mood and reduce stress levels.

# How to Brew White Coffee

White coffee requires a different brewing method than traditional coffee due to its harder texture. Here are some popular ways to prepare it:

# 1. Espresso Machine

White coffee works well with an espresso machine since the high pressure helps extract its nutty flavors and caffeine content.

# 2. Drip Coffee Maker

You can use a regular coffee maker, but it‚Äôs best to grind white coffee beans into a finer consistency before brewing.

# 3. French Press

Using a French press allows for a strong, full-bodied white coffee brew with rich flavors.

# 4. AeroPress

A great method for making smooth and concentrated white coffee, perfect for those who enjoy a strong caffeine kick.

# White Coffee vs. Regular Coffee: What‚Äôs the Difference?

||
||
|**Feature**|**White Coffee**|**Regular Coffee**|
|Roasting Temperature|Lower (\~325¬∞F)|Higher (\~450¬∞F)|
|Caffeine Content|Higher|Lower|
|Acidity Level|Lower|Higher|
|Flavor Profile|Nutty, Mild|Bold, Bitter|
|Antioxidants|Higher|Lower|

# Potential Side Effects of White Coffee

While white coffee has many benefits, it‚Äôs essential to be aware of potential side effects:

¬†

**High Caffeine Sensitivity**¬†‚Äì Since white coffee has more caffeine, it may cause jitters, restlessness, or insomnia in sensitive individuals.

**Digestive Issues**¬†‚Äì Although lower in acidity, excessive consumption may still lead to stomach discomfort for some people.

**Dependence and Withdrawal**¬†‚Äì Regular consumption of high-caffeine drinks may lead to dependence, causing withdrawal symptoms if intake is suddenly reduced.

¬†

# FAQs About White Coffee

# 1. Does white coffee have more caffeine than regular coffee?

Yes, white coffee has a higher caffeine content due to its lower roasting temperature.

# 2. Is white coffee less bitter than regular coffee?

Yes, white coffee has a smoother, nuttier flavor with less bitterness compared to dark-roasted coffee.

# 3. Can I drink white coffee if I have acid reflux?

Yes, white coffee is lower in acidity, making it a better option for those with acid reflux or sensitive stomachs.

# 4. How can I buy white coffee?

You can find white coffee online or in specialty coffee shops. Look for reputable brands that offer high-quality beans.

# 5. Is white coffee good for weight loss?

Yes, the antioxidants and caffeine in white coffee may support metabolism and weight management.

# Conclusion

White coffee is a fantastic alternative to traditional coffee, offering a unique flavor and a range of surprising health benefits. From its higher antioxidant content to its energy-boosting properties, this lightly roasted coffee can be an excellent addition to your daily routine. Whether you‚Äôre looking for a gentler option for your stomach, a stronger caffeine kick, or potential health advantages, white coffee is worth trying. Give it a shot and experience the benefits for yourself!

1iwqux4,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1iwqux4/i_keep_catching_my_roommate_standing_alone_in_the/,"I keep catching my roommate standing alone in the dark, and I think he‚Äôs been following me."," Me and my roommate have known each other for a couple years now. We met through my financial advisor in college, as I really needed a new place to live and she knew of another guy who attended school as well and needed a place to live. I met Sam at a coffee shop one day and we got along pretty well. We had enough similarities and decided to give it a shot. The first two years were great, we got along well and had different friend groups. We both did our jobs to keep the place clean and paid up, and gave each other enough space to never butt heads. Sam was alright. That is, until one day we had a rather big argument as he accused me of sneaking into his room at night. He claimed that he caught me walking around his room going through his things, leaving out of the window once I was caught. I was dumbfounded at this accusation, and had just assumed something happened in his life and he wanted out of the house.

 The next day when I got back home, I was fully prepared to have to explain to the landlord what had happened with Sam, hoping he could maybe help find me a new roommate. As I walked through the front door into the front room, I noticed something was different. Both the place, and Sam. I couldn‚Äôt quite place it, it was as if everything was moved slightly to the left or rotated just a degree or two. The place smelled funny, like new shoes, and Sam was waiting with his hands behind his back, smiling wide with a slight tilt to his head. He didn‚Äôt look normal, his eyes seemed wider, mouth longer. Sam apologized for the previous fight, and was adamant to tell me that his phone was stolen and he believes they had a break in. Sam almost commands me to block the old number, and to start using his new number which he provided. Sam didn‚Äôt sound normal either, he sounded like he had just drank ice cold water. Whatever the case, I didn‚Äôt have to find a new roommate so all was well. 

 He would stay away more than usual, something I would notice was he never seemed to change clothes, either. About a month ago, I woke up to strange noises from in the living room. When I went to investigate, I found Sam standing in the middle of the room, in complete darkness. Thinking he was sleep walking, I didn‚Äôt want to disturb him so I slowly crept away, back to my bed. Almost finding it funny, I turned on my side to let the night take me away when I heard Sam returning to his bed, slowly creeping down the hall, but as he walked past my room he looked right at me, with that wide smile, eyes piercing mine. This sent a jolt down my spine, and I quickly shut and locked the door. I tried not to come out at night anymore after that as he stood like this in almost every room in the house after mid night, making weird clicking noises as he stood in the black abyss. 

 One day as I was running errands, I swore I saw Sam on multiple occasions, but when I got home he was deep into cooking food, happy as ever to see me. I began to notice his features change even more over time; his eyes seemed to get deeper and bigger, mouth wider, and his build got taller and skinnier, and hair thinner and stiff like wire. He would stand in random rooms of the house every single night, making his clicking noises, and I would continue to think I saw him following me in public. I finally decided to find a new place to live, but I had to stay put for 3 months until the lease was up. When I told Sam that I wouldn‚Äôt be renewing my end of the lease, his face grew long and cold. Saddened by this news, he did not ask any questions, just started making clicking noises staring down at the floor. He then sparked up and attempted to go to his room when I confronted him about following me around town. Sam smiled, and told me I wasn‚Äôt going anywhere. Sam lunged towards me, a knife suddenly in hand. He got me right in the shoulder, but I was able to fight him off which sent the knife flying away. Sam ran off, as I called 911. 

 At the hospital, I had received news that would shake me to the core. When asked who attacked me, I told them what had been going on the past couple months, to which the police said they would get back to me. The very next day, I found out the horrible truth. Sam, my ex roommate, had moved out the very next day we got into our fight. Sam had moved 4 states away, having a job that would corroborate this, meaning Sam was not the one I had been living with this past couple months. Who the hell has taken the form of Sam, and decided they wanted to torment me? The real Sam had told police that he received a text from me stating that he was kicking him out, that he would murder him and his entire family if he even tried to call the police. This scared him, enough to make the real Sam not come asking questions. The real Sam stated that not only his belongings, but every single item in the house was brought to the curb when he came to grab his stuff. He mentioned that I approached him and looked severely disheveled, almost morphed, commanding him to block my number and to never contact him again. 

 The next night I stayed in the hospital, I could see him standing in the parking lot. Still using Sam‚Äôs face, still stalking me. That moment I realized it was either me or him. No one was going to help me, they all thought I was crazy now. In order to leave the hospital, I had to talk to a shrink. As I waited to speak to this person, I saw a lady sitting alone waiting in the corner of the waiting room, and she perked up when she caught my sight. She told me she over heard my story passing by in the hallway earlier, and she assured me I was not crazy. She claimed that the same thing happened to her a few years ago, and that even though she killed the monster stalking her, it still haunted her. She told me about how her sister had come home one day different, much like Sam. She claimed that she tried to help her sister, but this thing was not who she had thought, and ultimately she was forced to kill the creature. She told me that she still saw her twisted face every now and then, and that‚Äôs what keeps bringing her back there. Her name was Annie, and she told me I had to cut out the heart completely to kill the creatures, it was the only way, but to not return home to it. I needed to find him in public, but how would I do that?

 I was then called in to speak with the shrink, and I decided to be honest with him. When leaving the shrinks office, the girl was gone. I stayed for a couple more days at the hospital, as they suspected I may be suicidal. Each night I would see a figure standing in the parking lot, and one time I swore I saw Sam walking by my door just like that night he had been ‚Äòsleep walking‚Äô. But eventually I was deemed safe to be released, and with nowhere else to go I went back home to grab my things, remembering Annies words but I had assumed there was no way Sam would be there, but once again I was wrong. As I entered my home, I began to smell a very strong chemical smell, and to my surprise, I saw Sam there. Though not the real Sam, the monster hiding in Sam‚Äôs image. He welcomed me home, and offered to provide me with answers. I didn‚Äôt want to hear anything that cold deep voice was spouting, but I was very curious what hell this thing was, and what it wanted. But would I even be able to believe it? No. This is exactly where he wanted me, and with this sharp intrusion of a realization I decided to make a run for the back door. 

 Sam did not chase after, he just smiled watching me race for the door. I gripped the handle and paced through, only to walk right through the front door of my house, into the front room. What? I didn‚Äôt know what the hell just happened, so I turned right around and ran out the front door, only to now be coming in through the back door. I was trapped. Sam began to stretch out, quickly displaying sickly long arms and legs, like long branches peering off of a skinny, weathered trunk. Sam‚Äôs jaw elongated, his eyes popping out of his skull looking similar to a snails‚Äô. Sam then told me his real name; but I couldn‚Äôt pronounce it if my life depended on it. He told me to continue using Sam, as he‚Äôs grown fond of the human name. Branch like hands then shot out of the ground and held me in place, and Sam told me where he was from, and what he wanted. Sam was from an alternate plane, one that hosted many horrible evils. He told me some called it Hell, and that may be the best way to explain it. But one day he slipped through the veil, and his innate instincts told him to blend in, to become human. For centuries he would blend in, taking someones identity and being an imposter, feeding on the lies, manipulation, benefitting in ways our human minds just can‚Äôt understand.

 And so I sit here, trapped in some strange suspended version of my house, caught between a few different timelines. I know that sounds strange, but isn‚Äôt all of this? In one reality, Im still pinned to the floor with the strange branches clutching me tightly, Sam hissing and clicking in my face, feeding off my fear. In another reality I click forward to, I am sitting on my bed, typing this entire story out, hoping that it is read by someone who knows how to help me. The other two realities that I click forward into aren‚Äôt really worth mentioning, but I will anyways. Hell maybe it is relevant somehow? In one of them I‚Äôm actually a little girl. Just a small child, one who looks strikingly familiar. The last one is a timeline where this creature never found me. I am enjoying my house with a lady who seems to be my wife, and my small daughter, but we soon get a knock at the door. I stand up to get the door, but it always clicks forward to another time line reality just as the door opens, and when it becomes time to return to this reality, and resets to the beginning and I never remember the outcome until after. 

 I think I‚Äôve found a way out of this loop, this prison that I seem to be stuck in. Someone has been knocking at the door to my room recently. I always figured it was Sam, but maybe it was something else, someone else. If you don‚Äôt hear back from me, I either lost the fight and I‚Äôm doomed, or I won and somehow lost memory of this log. To the real Sam: I hope this monster hasn‚Äôt found you like he did me, and to Annie: I hope that the hauntings have stopped for you. For now, this is goodbye.

I currently own a 20 gallon fish tank which I bought from savers for like $15 and then I bought a lid off craigslist for $20. I have two females and even though they seem to be okay, I feel like they deserve a larger enclosure. I was even thinking of getting a coffee table and making a cage out of it but I don't have the space to build it. I looked at a ton of amazon cages as well as cages everywhere in general but none seem to be up to my standard. Like I searched for 40-55 gallon tanks but a lot don't come with a mesh lid(my girls like their climbing toys and hamocks), and I looked at the bucatstate cage which looked very promising but a lot of people said it came damaged and it's hard to replace the pieces, then I looked at reptile cages and I LOVED the open doors but I wouldn't be able to put enough substrate for my girls. I wish I could just buy a cage rather than realizing that DIY cages are just so much better and suit actual pets. I love my 20 gallon, but I think they're just outgrowing it. Anyways, I'm just curious what everyone else uses for a cage that isn't ginormous but also hits the minimum of at least 40 gallons of space. THANK YOU SO MUCH !! ALL HELP IS SUPER MUCH APPRECIATED !!

1iwqs53,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1iwqs53/i_think_my_wife_voluntarily_gave_herself_to_the/,I think my wife voluntarily gave herself to the forest.,"How long does grieving last? I asked myself every single day for almost 3 years since my wife disappeared, and I never got an answer. The reminder that I was alone came every time I woke up and went to bed. Eventually, the reality sets in and I start to get used to eating alone, brushing my teeth alone, grocery shopping alone, and just being alone. I thought enough time had passed that I didn't have to ask myself that question anymore until the day I got a phone call from the nursing team who took care of my mother-in-law. Denise, the old lady, was planning on moving herself into a nearby nursing home, but now it sounds like she had too, passed.

When I arrived at their home I was met by one of the nurses who had taken care of Denise. She tried to leave quickly, not wanting to stay around the house long. We had a small conversation about where everything was in the home, and how most of the things inside were packed up and ready for storage, and then were given a set of keys for the house, each labeled with the rooms inside.

I tried to ask for more details, but all the nurse gave me was a passing chuckle as she turned to go to her car, getting inside and driving away without another word. It was a reasonable response when it involved anything that had to do with Denise. The old lady was going on 80 and was unbearable to be around. The last time I had spoken to her most of our conversation was loud coughing and nonsense.

The old house smelt like a hospital. Cardboard boxes were stacked randomly around the home with a thin layer of dust blanketing each surface. The TV and larger furniture stayed unpacked, only covered in a layer of plastic wrap. I was married to my wife for 5 years before she vanished, and I don't recall ever being in her childhood home. The old house sat in a suburban row of homes, all facing away from the tree line leading into the dense woods of the Pacific Northwest.

I stuffed the keys into my pockets and carefully squeezed between the stacked boxes. Small framed pictures of my wife at various ages still hung along the walls and sat across the small coffee table. I guess Denise wanted to take these in her bag, or maybe, like me, it was difficult to let her go.

With no one left in the family, the responsibility fell on me to take care of what was left of their belongings. I figured I would get the boxes to storage and clean the rest of the house before deciding what to do with it. I loaded a couple into my car, staring at the dishes and kitchenware, before stumbling on a pile of boxes with her name written across them.

‚ÄúGwen‚Äù

I read to the silent house. With a long deep breath, I carried the boxes to the coffee table and opened them. Inside were articles of clothing, old bound notebooks, photo albums, and school memorabilia. I flipped through them, and seeing her on every page brought tears. Her smile lit up each sun-faded page, and each wood frame she was captured in threatened to set on fire with her warmth. These boxes were going to stay with me.

I dried my tears and kept going, wanting to see more of her. I moved away a pile of old clothes and notebooks when my hand met something hard and hollow. Buried at the bottom of one of the boxes, were a hefty bag of small CDs, and a handheld video camera. I pulled them out and immediately went to turn it on. Unsurprisingly, the old thing wouldn't turn on, and the battery compartment was corroded shut with the old batteries still inside. I wrestled with it in the kitchen with a butter knife and got it opened and cleaned, then with the double As from the TV remote, got the thing to switch on. I inspected the camera again, excited to get it working, and saw it had a name written in marker on the side.

‚ÄúGwen‚Äù

I shuffled through the CDs, each labeled with a date, a few not. The first was for her 8th birthday, the small red-haired girl's face was right up in the camera lens, peering in with her bright steel blue eyes. She let out an excited squeal and ran to hug her parents, thanking her mom and dad for the expensive gift. I guess film making had always been her passion. Her father responded with something unintelligible, and a heavy cough before he left the frame. I had never met the man when he was alive, and she never talked much about him. A moment later he returned with a big birthday cake, and then the three ate it together. The rest of the CD was just them eating before shutting off randomly. The old CDs didn't have that much storage, each having only about 20 minutes of memory.

I spent the next few hours going through her childhood. Several moments in the videos I recall her telling me about, late nights when we would lay in bed and talk until sunrise, other moments just small silly things a child with a video camera would film. Her father eventually showed up less and less in the videos, his cough worsening every time until he was no longer in them. For a long while the videos stopped, a large year-long gap before I saw her face again. Her smiles were never the same, she talked less, and some videos were just her talking about her day to her father and writing silently in her notebooks. Eventually, the pile of memories grew smaller and smaller, and when I almost reached the end of the dated discs, I decided to take a look at one without any date on it.

Heavy breathing interlaced with the crackle of the built-in microphone blasted through the tiny speakers, filling up the empty home more than everything else that night. The screen was dark, with only a small light coming from the left corner of the video. The lens stuttered and focused, eventually I was able to make out a line of trees and a street light, but the image was still blurred. It stayed focused on the dark woods for another moment before the camera was pushed forward, hitting a glass surface before it struggled to focus once again, the heavy breathing of my wife still close to the microphone.

I leaned in as if it would help the video focus, the blurry tree line being barely visible in the dark. Between the breaths of my wife, I could hear the camera force itself to focus, sharpening itself until the woods got steadily more and more visible. The camera stayed like that for 18 minutes, glued in position, and so did my wife. My eyes stayed trained on the trees just like she was in the video, watching for any movement at all, only leaving the treeline to check the timer on the video. It got to 19 minutes, and then as it slowly reached its end something shifted in the trees. The video ended, blinding me with the harsh blue menu of the settings screen.

Immediately I replaced the disk with another unmarked one. The next one was during the day, She stood just at the edge of the woods, camera raised and pointed towards the thick darkness created by the trees. The normally tranquil sounds of birds and nature in the background were sometimes interrupted by a heavy cough. Each time the camera fell for a moment I imagined she tried to stifle her cough. I watched again to the end of this video, all 20 minutes of just the camera pointed into the woods, but nothing happened.

The following four undated videos also showed nothing, just my wife, at various points and locations around her house, filming the woods for twenty minutes. The audio was always just background noise, coughing, and the mechanical whirl of the camera's focus. On the last dated one, I could see her reflection in the window as she filmed.  
She sat in the kitchen, the camera pointed towards the window above her sink, and the tree line beyond her yard. She was probably about 15 or 16 at this point, looking just like the first time we had met in high school. The camera tried to focus again on the woods, zooming between her reflection and the tree line. She let out another cough, this time just a brief one, and then opened a bottle of pills, swallowing them dry before letting the camera roll to its end. I had run out of CDs.

I stood from my spot on the ground and turned towards the kitchen window. It was now nighttime, making the darkness of the treeline even more oppressing than it was a few moments earlier on the screen. I stood and stared for a moment like she did, trying to scan the dark with my eyes but the trees stayed the same.

With a shudder, I pulled the blinds down to shut the window and made my way back to the with the help of my phone light. There were no more videos. I carelessly dumped out the rest of the boxes with her name on them across the floor and found nothing. Realizing what I'd done to what I had left of my wife I started to mournfully repack her items neatly into the boxes when I accidentally kicked something across the ground.

Her notebooks. I picked them up and laid them across the coffee table. There were only 3 of them, one of them a locked toy Barbie notebook that I wasn't going to get open unless I smashed the thing and the other two old leather bound style books. I carefully unwrapped the straps around them and flipped through the weathered pages, mostly filled with bits of writing and drawings.

Across the two available notebooks, her art style visibly improved and she wrote less and less. Like the videos, the drawings were about her and her parents. Unfortunately, they were almost exactly like the videos, chronicling and recording how ill her father eventually got more and more ill. The drawings and entries transitioned from them getting ice cream, hiking, and summer barbecues to hospital visits, sitting on their back porch, and looking into the woods. Then it was just the woods. The second half of her third notebook was just pages and pages of the trees, and nothing more, until the last two pages.

The graphite of the pencil was aggressively forced into the paper, splaying out an image of the tree line into the last two pages of her notebook. I ran my fingers along each tree and could feel them etched into the page, the black powder left behind by her pencil so long ago still stained my fingertips. In the middle of the page, done by what I assumed was an eraser trying to remove the forest from the notebook, stood a gaunt figure towering over the trees.

I closed the notebooks and set them back in the box and sealed them once again. I turned on every light in the house, first the entire ground floor, before making my way to the upstairs. I wanted to snuff out every single dark corner of this home to chase away a fear I refused to acknowledge. I shifted through the key chain in my pocket, entered every room, and turned on every light until I reached the locked door at the end of the hallway. I had one key left, one with her name written on the small tag that clung to it.

‚ÄúGwen‚Äù

Two times the keys fell out of my hands until I finally got them into the lock. It didn't click like the rest of the doors, but instead, the lock turned with a rusted and sticky scrape. I thought Denise was joking when she said she had left my wife's room the same as the day she left and never opened it, but I realize now that she was telling the truth. I coughed hard as I pushed on the door. It took an agonizing amount of force to open, and as it did it pushed something across the floor, sending dust from on top of the door frame down on my head. My hand reached for where the light switch should be but couldn't find anything. I opened the door wider so that the light from the hallway could spill into the room enough for me to see.

Her desk was stacked with at least a hundred of the same leather-bound notebooks she had in her box, the strap barely holding them close as they were stuffed with extra sheets of paper. Scattered across the ground were even more of them, their pages ripped out. Moonlight tried to enter the room through the window but was forced back by something covering the glass. I took out my phone to shine its light across the walls to see where the ripped pages went. Across every surface possible were drawings of the woods.",6,1740362144.0,scarystories,1,0.88,False

1iwqm7x,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Darkness_WithIn6833/comments/1iwqm7x/delivered_never_read/,"Delivered, Never Read","The soft hum of the house echoed in the stillness of the evening, broken only by the occasional creak of the floorboards underfoot. Valyria sat on the edge of the worn leather couch, the warmth of the coffee mug cradled in her hands, though the liquid inside had long since cooled. Her gaze flickered across the room‚Äîdisheveled but familiar, a reflection of her life now: toys scattered in a corner, children‚Äôs books stacked unevenly on the coffee table, the faint scent of lavender from a candle she had burned earlier in the day. She breathed it in, trying to ground herself in the present, but her thoughts kept drifting back to him.

The screen of her phone lit up, an alert from Caius: ‚ÄúBusy. Talk later.‚Äù

Her heart sank. She had been hoping for more, perhaps even a simple how are you? or I miss you. But no. It was the same as always‚Äîa message that was little more than an afterthought, a reminder that he was somewhere far away, buried in work that she could never fully grasp.

Her lips tightened as she set the phone down, the edges of her mouth pulled into a frown she couldn‚Äôt shake. The silence in the house was heavier now, the stillness amplifying the space between them, even though they were supposed to be in the same relationship.

Her eyes drifted toward the windows, where the last light of the day filtered through the curtains, casting a soft golden glow on the room. Shadows played on the walls, flickering like memories that felt too distant now. She tried to remember the last time they had spent more than a few minutes together in the same room, not just physically but emotionally. When had they last shared a quiet conversation, a real moment, instead of the quick exchanges that seemed to define them now?

She closed her eyes, feeling the weight of the truth settle like a stone in her chest. Maybe it wasn‚Äôt that Caius couldn‚Äôt be there for her, but that he didn‚Äôt know how. Or perhaps it was something deeper, something about him‚Äîabout them‚Äîthat she hadn‚Äôt wanted to admit, but couldn‚Äôt deny anymore.

The connection that had once felt so vibrant between them had slowly faded, replaced by routine, by roles they both played but never questioned. They had their dynamics‚Äîhis quiet submission, her calm control‚Äîbut where was the us? Where were the moments where they stripped away all the labels and just existed together? The thought of it stung her throat, a raw ache she couldn‚Äôt quite name.

She stood, the decision pressing against her, heavier than the emotional fog she‚Äôd been living in. She crossed the room, the floor creaking softly beneath her feet as she walked to the window. Outside, the neighborhood was quiet, the last traces of daylight disappearing into the horizon. The air was thick with the hum of nighttime, the chirps of crickets faint in the distance.

Valyria let her hand rest on the cool glass of the window, her reflection staring back at her‚Äîa woman, strong and caring, but weary now. She could no longer ignore the truth. She had been waiting for Caius to come back to her, to see her, to listen, but perhaps the truth was that he wasn‚Äôt capable of offering what she needed. Not because he didn‚Äôt care‚Äîbut because he didn‚Äôt know how. And, she wondered, did she even want to keep hoping for something that might never come?

The tears welled up, hot and unbidden, but she didn‚Äôt let them fall for long. It wasn‚Äôt sadness that filled her now‚Äîit was clarity. She turned away from the window, the reflection of herself fading into the dimly lit room.

The kids were still asleep in their rooms. The house was still theirs, her own little world where she ran things, where she balanced everything. And now, the realization that she had to balance herself too settled into her mind.

She walked down the hallway to the children‚Äôs rooms, her steps quiet but determined. As she stood in the doorway of the nursery, watching her youngest shift slightly in her sleep, Valyria felt a sense of peace return. She didn‚Äôt need to rely on Caius to define her happiness. There was more than just him, more than just the roles they played.

The possibilities were there. She would explore them. And if he couldn‚Äôt‚Äîor wouldn‚Äôt‚Äîbe the partner she needed, she would find her own way, her own path.

In that moment, she realized she had been waiting for him to catch up to her, but maybe it was time for her to move forward on her own. And for the first time in a long time, the future didn‚Äôt feel so uncertain.

Valyria sat on the couch, her thumb hovering over the screen of her phone, tracing the words she had typed over and over again. ‚ÄúHey, are you there?‚Äù

She glanced at the clock. It had been two hours since she had sent the message. She had been patient at first, trying to give him space, trying not to overwhelm him. But the longer the silence stretched, the harder it became to ignore the sinking feeling in her chest.

Delivered. The tiny gray text mocking her every time she checked. Not a single word from him. Not even a read receipt. Just delivered. It lingered like a constant reminder that she was speaking into the void, her messages falling into a black hole where they would remain unheard, unacknowledged.

She had tried to be understanding‚Äîtried to tell herself that he was just busy, that his work took precedence. But the hours of silence had worn away her patience, and now she was left with nothing but the emptiness of the screen and the growing sense that maybe this was all she would ever get from him.

Her fingers tightened around the phone, the smooth surface feeling cold and distant against her palm. She refreshed the screen once more, as though willing something to change. Delivered.

The silence felt suffocating. It wasn‚Äôt just that he didn‚Äôt respond‚Äîit was the lack of response. The fact that he could see her messages and still choose not to engage, that he could go hours, days even, without a single word, left her questioning everything.

What was it about her that made her presence so easy to ignore? Did she not matter enough to warrant a response? Did the effort to acknowledge her somehow feel like too much?

She leaned back against the couch, rubbing her eyes. There was a heaviness in her chest that she couldn‚Äôt shake, a deep frustration gnawing at her. How many times had she tried to reach out, only to be met with this cold distance? She couldn‚Äôt even be sure if he was able to respond, or if he simply didn‚Äôt want to.

As the hours passed and the darkness outside deepened, the unanswered messages felt more like a barrier between them than a line of communication. Her mind spun with all the possibilities‚Äîwas it her? Was she too much to handle, too demanding in her desire for connection?

Her phone buzzed suddenly, snapping her out of her thoughts. She grabbed it eagerly, her heart quickening. But when she saw the message, it wasn‚Äôt from Caius.

Delivered.

He had just finished removing his gear and piling it on the vacant counter‚Äîthe hipster was nowhere to be found‚Äîwhen the two boys blasted up the ramp, through the door, blowing by him like a hurricane, across the dance floor, and through the floating birds and butterflies.

‚ÄúHunters out front!‚Äù Hawk shouted.

He went to the door and saw the black sedan parked in front of the ramp. Apart from the pedestrians and street-side merchants, there was no discernible danger.

He grabbed the skateboard and dropped down the ramp. Damn, they were fast! He reached the other side, where the only place to go was up the stairs to the second level.

He left the skateboard on the deck and took the steps two at a time.

The second level looked down over the ramps and dance floor. Now, it was empty, but on a busy night, it would be like watching a carnival. He passed a vacant cinema. A big stainless-steel table was strangely bent in half. A man in a white chef‚Äôs shirt, large mustache, and pompadour haircut watched them without comment as he kneaded dough.

He burst through the exit, almost stumbling over Spike. They were on the wrought iron skywalk that served as access to the upper levels of the BAT. Its chainlink and wire mesh walls and ceiling formed a tunnel around them.

‚ÄúDid you see him?‚Äù Hawk shouted.

‚ÄúSee who?‚Äù said Nash.

‚ÄúDown!‚Äù Hawk commanded.

‚ÄúNo! Up!‚Äù Spike countered. ‚ÄúFight from the high ground.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo fighting!‚Äù said Hawk.

‚ÄúYou coming, Goofy Foot?‚Äù said Spike.

‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt miss it,‚Äù said Nash.

The boys ascended the steps at a sprint. He struggled to keep up and when that was impossible, determined just to keep moving. The subzero air pricked his face. Higher and higher they went on the switchback of the stairs. On the ground, people, food carts, motorcycles, and cars shrank to toy-sized figures. The skywalk had spanned the chasm to latch onto a different edifice of thick windows, through which he could vaguely make out a man in suit and tie.

Atop the next run, they were waiting for him on an oval landing before another tunnel that was darker due to a plastic material intended to block the wind.

‚ÄúWhat was it?‚Äù Nash gasped.

‚ÄúAndreas,‚Äù said Hawk.

‚ÄúSounds like a badass.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe _is!_‚Äù said Spike, his voice pierced by panic.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs hunting Spike,‚Äù said Hawk. ‚ÄúCome on. We need more distance.‚Äù He jumped into the dimness of the tunnel.

They came to a junction in the tunnel that offered two options: left‚Äîstairs descending to a lower, parallel passage where, from his angle, he glimpsed a woman selling coffee from a cart; right‚Äîa spur leading away from the main tunnel to a set of doors in the glass building. Hawk didn‚Äôt hesitate. He chose the spur and pushed through the doors.

They found themselves inside what seemed to be the warehouse of an electronics market. Boxes of computers, AR glasses, TVs, and an array of diverse gadgets towered overhead.

Hawk slammed the door shut, grabbed a metal broom resting against the wall, and wedged it through the handles.

‚ÄúSinay Night market,‚Äù said Spike.

A corridor of stalls, shuttered until the evening, guided them to a sharp right turn. The air changed dramatically, carrying the scent of raw meat. An ancient man with a white beard on his chin and a blood-stained apron around his waist held a rack of meat in one hand and a cleaver in the other. Spike asked him something in the dialect, and he pointed with his blade to a curtain of transparent slats. Hawk went through first, then Spike, and then Nash. Warm air hit his face.

The night market expanded into a large corridor where the walls and shelves teemed with a vast array of fabrics‚Äîmaterials cascaded from ceiling to floor in a kaleidoscope of colors and textures. Compact workstations tucked into the textile jungle buzzed with focused work. Music muted by the garments mixed with the hum of sewing machines and the rhythmic _snip snip_ of shears cutting crisp cloth. Briefly, the curious eyes of a girl or boy, too young to be employed, glanced at them but did not linger.

‚ÄúThere it is,‚Äù Hawk said.

At the terminus of the sweatshop, a narrow elevator was embedded in the wall like a chameleon. If the kid hadn‚Äôt stopped him, Nash would have walked right by, unaware.

Hawk slid up a panel, revealing a nondescript number pad with a solitary, red LED. He entered a code. The pad gave a soft chime, the light turned blue, and the door slid open with a hiss.

They pressed inside, and the door closed on the room of busy tailors, dousing them in silence. Hawk punched in a code on a screen in the door.

‚ÄúThe code is 3290. You got that?‚Äù he said.

Spike nodded.

‚ÄúNever come here. But just in case.‚Äù

Spike nodded again.

The lights changed from neutral white to violet. The numbers vanished, replaced by the image of a black dragon. When it flapped its wings, Nash felt the sensation of movement.

‚ÄúJust like on the tuk-tuk,‚Äù said Spike.

Hawk put a hand on the boy‚Äôs shoulder.

Behind the dragon, the floors were increasing. 17, 18‚Ä¶25, 26‚Ä¶35‚Ä¶42‚Ä¶54.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre fuckin‚Äô high,‚Äù said Spike.

The elevator slowed, and the boy said, ‚ÄúFifty-four! Holy shit!‚Äù

The door slid open, and they stepped into a black hallway. On the wall in front of them, the design of a dragon backlit in gold light.

‚ÄúFollow my lead, okay?‚Äù

‚ÄúIs this what I think it is?‚Äù Nash said, though he didn‚Äôt have to ask.

The rumors and legends of the secretive and illicit bordello known as The Silk Dragon preceded it in gentlemen‚Äôs circles and schoolboy taunts around the world. Human trafficking that reached the highest levels of society. Owned by the infamous and anonymous Madame Lan, it was said to exist in the Asiatowns of the East, but the United States assured it had taken measures to prevent the spread of the franchise into its territory.

The teen looked at his shoes in shame. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ just the money,‚Äù he said.

Suddenly, Spike hugged his friend. Looking up at Nash, he said, ‚ÄúYou got a problem with him, you got a problem with me.‚Äù

Nash lifted his hands. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cool as ice.‚Äù

They followed Hawk down the black velvet corridor. Golden lights lined the floor as in a movie theater. The scent of cigarette smoke and musk cologne hung in the air. On each side of the hallway, ornate doors displayed erotic engravings. Spike tried to inspect each one, but Hawk yanked him along.

They stopped at a golden door with the design of a mosaic tiger made from crushed mirror. Hawk pressed his thumb on the tiger. A woman‚Äôs soft voice spoke over an intercom system.

‚ÄúHawk, long time no see.‚Äù

‚ÄúBeen busy,‚Äù the boy said. ‚ÄúLook, we just need a place to chill for a little while.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe?‚Äù said the voice.

‚ÄúMy friend and my‚Ä¶‚Äù He looked at Nash. ‚ÄúMy grandfather.‚Äù

After a pause, the voice said, ‚ÄúSure, Hawk. We still have your room.‚Äù

The intercom system buzzed, and the door opened inward on an automatic hinge. A smiling woman met them at a counter. She wore a glittering red dress that came off one slender shoulder.

‚Äú_Chau em,_‚Äù she said.

‚Äú_Nuna_,‚Äù said Hawk.

‚ÄúIs little brother okay? I worry about you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine. Just need a place, you know.‚Äù

The woman, whose age was hidden beneath her makeup, looked first at Spike. ‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt he a young one?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs just gonna play video games.‚Äù

She turned to Nash. ‚ÄúFacial recognition doesn‚Äôt find him on the books.‚Äù She was looking at a monitor concealed in the desk. ‚ÄúYou know the rules, little brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúI said he‚Äôs my grandpa.‚Äù

‚ÄúThe resemblance is striking.‚Äù She held out a pad to Nash. ‚ÄúScan.‚Äù

Nash looked at Hawk, who just shrugged. He placed his hand on the device. It blinked green.

‚ÄúWelcome to The Silk Dragon residence in the BAT,‚Äù said the woman. She paused, regarding the boys and biting her lip. ‚ÄúI hope you enjoy.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm his grandfather, lady,‚Äù said Nash.

Her enigmatic smile remained consistent.

‚ÄúYou still owe a small debt to the Dragon, Hawk. Any idea when we can expect payment?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm working on it,‚Äù Hawk said, his tone replete with defeat.

‚ÄúGood to have you back, little brother.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not back. You‚Äôll get your money, but I‚Äôm not back,‚Äù he said venomously.

_That‚Äôs it, kid. Fight them_.

Her facial expression as frozen as a mask of ice, she handed a golden coin to Hawk and bowed politely as a set of doors next to the desk opened before them.

Hawk took them through.

They passed a room full of computers at individual stations, where young men smoked and played video games. A collection of empty beer cans, liquor bottles, and cup noodles filled a large garbage can at the front.

They entered a long hall that curved like a crescent moon, lined on one side by rooms with opaque windows. An open door revealed an office setting where a husky man in a suit paced the floor, swearing at his phone in a mixture of dialect and Korean. A boy of Hawk‚Äôs age, naked except for a small pair of briefs, stretched on a chaise lounge of plush scarlet, gazing into a VR headset, lost in the world beyond. Spike craned his neck to see more, but the man came to the door, pressed a button, and it slid shut like a cataract across a dirty dream.

At the end of the hallway, a young blond man in a three-piece suit that barely contained his bulging biceps stood at a podium, a communication device in his ear.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre fucking kidding me! Hawk!‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, Diesel.‚Äù Hawk held out the gold coin. The man took it from him and scanned it with a bracelet on his right wrist.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd see you again,‚Äù said Diesel. His arms looked like they could indeed benchpress a diesel engine.

‚ÄúYeah, well. I guess you never know. I thought you were going back to school,‚Äù Hawk said.

Diesel shrugged, a shadow of sadness crossing his face. ‚ÄúSome things don‚Äôt work out. My number got called.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck off!‚Äù Hawk exclaimed.

‚ÄúSeriously,‚Äù said Diesel.

‚ÄúShit, I‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù

‚ÄúBasic training after Christmas. Just bringing in some extra cash for my mom before I go.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll see a different part of the world, I guess. Don‚Äôt let the FEEN boys give you herpes.‚Äù

They laughed.

Nash felt a lonesome sadness in this banter between the brothel brothers, as if an ending and a beginning were transpiring.

‚ÄúHey, I pretty much live here these days, so if you ever want to‚Ä¶ hang or something?‚Äù said Diesel.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù said Hawk with a shrug.

‚ÄúAnd who is this? I love your hair, mate.‚Äù Diesel rubbed one of Spike‚Äôs dreads between his strong fingers. Spike pulled back and, for a moment of protection, pressed into Nash.

‚ÄúSpike,‚Äù said Hawk.

‚ÄúOh‚ÄîOh! _The_ Spike,‚Äù said Diesel.

‚ÄúAnd my‚Ä¶ gramps.‚Äù Hawk put his arm over Nash‚Äôs shoulder.

Diesel inspected him closely and winked. ‚ÄúThe treasures of the Silk Dragon are its secrets.‚Äù

‚Äú_Dumaaa!‚Äù_ Hawk swore. ‚ÄúIt ain‚Äôt fucking like that!‚Äù

Diesel laughed. ‚ÄúJust messing with you. They haven‚Äôt touched your room. She said you‚Äôd be back.‚Äù

‚ÄúI ain‚Äôt fucking back.‚Äù

Diesel bowed.

Another line of the opaque rooms continued past the podium. At the farthest, Hawk halted and pressed his thumb on a panel‚Äîthe door clicked and opened.",1,1740361628.0,HFY,2,1.0,False
1iwqm45,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1iwqm45/i_had_a_sudden_hearing_loss_with_23_and_it_ruined/,I had a sudden hearing loss with 23 and it ruined my life,"Sorry in advance for my bad English and weird spelling.

What might be relevant: I have a rare heart condition and i have to take blood thinners. 

I, f23, suddenly experienced hearing loss in October 2024. 
I was sitting on my couch when, out of nowhere, I went completely deaf in my right ear. I couldn‚Äôt even hear 90 decibels. It all happened over the course of the day, without any warning. That day, I had been out shopping, carrying heavy bags, drinking a coffee, and actually thinking about finally quitting alcohol. I had been drinking a lot before that, because of my Depression, almost every third day. My body was used to it; I had a high tolerance. Just the day before my hearing loss, I had almost finished an entire bottle of whiskey cause i was grieving the loss of my second pet..

In the weeks leading up to this, I had to put my dog down and had just come out of a toxic situationship that involved a heavy lot of alcohol. All of this had taken a huge toll on me, both physically and mentally.

That evening, when my ear suddenly felt blocked, it was like the sensation you get on an airplane, except the pressure never went away. On Sunday, I finally went to the emergency doctor, where they confirmed that I was completely deaf in my right ear. Two weeks later, I had surgery - but without anesthesia. Because of my heart condition, which is one of the rare ones, they didn‚Äôt want to risk putting me under since there‚Äôs still very little known about it. So, I was awake the entire time and only had local anesthesia. It was one of the worst experiences I‚Äôve ever had, and the pain was unbearable. During the procedure, I even asked the doctor to inject more narcotics into my ear while the operation was happening, because the effect had worn off and i could feel every cut he took in my ear. 

But hey, at least I got to see my own ear cartilage on a screen.
yay!?‚Ä¶

Since November, my hearing loss has remained at 45 decibels, with no improvement. I have constant, loud tinnitus that follows me day and night. My next appointment check with the ENT doctor is not until the end of March. 

Since that happened, my social life has completely changed. I‚Äôve been withdrawing more and more. I actually used to love going out with my friends to a bar or having drinks. I loved music more than anything. I listened to Spotify every day and enjoyed every minute. Always made sure to protect my ears from loud music, and then suddenly, it was all taken away from me. Mentally, I‚Äôm struggling. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll ever be able to live a normal life again. That makes me even more depressed than the situation already does.
For me, life already feels meaningless at 23, even though I have my whole life ahead of me. But this is taking away such a big part of me, and I just don‚Äôt know how to keep looking forward. Every day is just a ‚ÄúI have to get through the day,‚Äù nothing more.
I‚Äôve already had to give up a lot in life because of my heart condition and be extra careful (except with alcohol i have to admit), and now this hearing loss is added to it. 
I just hate my fucking life 

The only good thing about the whole situation is, that I‚Äôve been sober since October, and I‚Äôve never felt better physically. I also look a bit better now. I eat a lot healthier and drink tea every day, which has helped me lose a lot of unnecessary water weight.

I don‚Äôt know what I want to achieve with this text. I think I just needed to get it off my chest. I don‚Äôt know if my ear will ever improve or if the tinnitus will ever go away. I hate to wake up everyday and i want to sleep till this nightmare is finally over. 

Thank you for reading.

This is purely SFW and probably a one time thing. We can talk via chat, over a cup of coffee, or while weightlifting lol

1iwqisf,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1iwqisf/awkward_first_date/,Awkward first date,"I‚Äôm a very inexperienced dater. This was my first ever online dating date. I met up basically with a complete stranger after talking about a week and i got the date 2 days after I downloaded tinder. 

Anyways, it really was awkward. A lot of it was a ton of nervous energy from the both of us. With my lack of experience, I had difficulty kind of taking the lead within the conversation (I tend to go out with extroverted girls who love to take the lead when conversing, and therefore it‚Äôs easier for me to talk to them). This girl is much more introverted and she also let me know before hand that she tends to be awkward the first time before hanging out with someone.

The date was us meeting up for coffee and then a walk. The walk was very unplanned, as we went to various spots on campus (we‚Äôre both college students) and then it ended with me dropping her to her dorm room. The only reason I decided to go for a walk was bc the convo we were having at the coffee shop was much too job interview-ey. The walk I think helped the both of us, as we kinda got past that awkwardness and had some decent convo. 

My thing is, I don‚Äôt believe the first time meeting someone (especially online) should be a key determinant of whether they‚Äôll be a good friend, much less partner. I‚Äôve made some very close friends where I was originally incredibly awkward because of continued proximity. I‚Äôm in a fraternity: my big is not someone who‚Äôd I‚Äôd be friends with on day one, and meeting him day one was awkward. But I love him now and he‚Äôs one of my best friends because we kept on talking and having fun together. Idk if that‚Äôs how dating works though. 

Which is why I‚Äôm asking whether or not asking for a second date is worth it. On one hand, the first date was incredibly awkward with minimal chemistry. I see signs of life, but I‚Äôm genuinely confused what I can do to. Through the date I saw signs of ‚Äúlife‚Äù so to speak, just in general attraction and convo. Like, it‚Äôs clear she was interested, but awkward (I say this because she never attempted to leave early, was ever rude, and she didn‚Äôt give the vibe she was uncomfortable, just awkward). And she has walls naturally kinda set up, which is why I do wonder if a 2nd date might not the worst idea.

Because of my lack of experience, idk what vibe to look for. I‚Äôm really big on the slow burn idea of relationships, since I‚Äôve been ghosted by people whom I‚Äôve instantly connected with. Ik it‚Äôs hard for some people to instantly connect on a first date

My logic is that a 2nd date will give a better idea of whether or not pursuit of a relationship is even realistic in the first place. I only know the bare surface area stuff of someone. I as a person tend to either have rly close friends or acquaintances and no in between. I personally think there‚Äôs a really awesome girl behind that wall introvertedness, but because of a lackluster first date I wonder if it‚Äôs even worth exploring that option.

Ben, the leader of our gang, was the latest to disappear. 

*""He's been taken by the white van,""*  was the rumor.

So, the shelter‚Äîwhere kids were vanishing‚Äîwasn't ideal.

But it *did* have soup and coffee, so I risked it.

Charlie was my first friend. 

He slid next to me one morning, smiling, grasping his own bowl of soup. 

With dark brown hair under his hood and freckled cheeks, I knew the streets would eat him alive.

""Take *that* off,"" I grumbled through a mouthful of stale bread.

That was the first thing I said to him, annoyed he'd interrupted my meal. 

I nodded to his fancy jacket.

""Put it in your backpack, idiot. Unless you *want* to be robbed.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt mean to invite him to sit with me, but he looked lost. Charlie was loud and obnoxious, but he made me smile‚Äîeven in freezing temperatures.

One morning, the two of us sat shivering on a wall, our legs dangling.

""Do you believe in angels, Finn?"" he asked, kicking his legs happily. 

For a homeless kid, he was *chipper*.

I rolled my eyes. ""Nope. If God was real, my parents wouldn‚Äôt have kicked me out for liking boys.""

Charlie shuffled closer, resting his head on my shoulder. ""You like boys?""

I jerked back with a hiss. ""Dude! Get off me!""

""Sorry,"" he muttered, rubbing his hands. ""You‚Äôre‚Ä¶ warm.""

I didn‚Äôt respond. I hated that I liked the way he rested against me.

He *was* warm.

That night, I sent Charlie to grab dinner.

He never came back.

I looked for him, screaming his name. But nobody cared about street kids.

It‚Äôs easy to be numb on the streets. Easy to shut down.

But when I saw those dark curls and that stupid jacket, I ran, heart pounding.

I wasn‚Äôt supposed to feel like *this*.

That‚Äôs what dad said.

But I wrapped my arms around Charlie, sobbing, letting myself break apart. 

Fuck. I would never let him go again‚Äì never again. 

*Never again*. 

He was warm.

Too warm.

His coat was thicker. More expensive.

""Where did you go?!"" I demanded, shoving him.

Charlie just smiled.

A clammy hand clamped over my mouth, gagging my scream. 

I was thrown into a white van, the shutters violently slamming down.

""I'm sorry, Finn,"" Charlie said from outside.

""But... you're the perfect shape and body for my father.""

Stumbling back, I dropped to my knees  choking on the stink of *decay*. 

In front of me lay a boy.

Ben.

His skin was gray, dried blood staining his face.

But the twisted, feathery appendages protruding from his back held my gaze.

Wings.

Rotting wings‚Äîan attempt at splicing human and something else entirely. 

Dying inside a body that was ice-cold and alone, where he would never be found. 

Just like‚Ä¶ *me*.

""Finn?"" Charlie's whisper slipped through the shutters.

I held onto his voice, willing it to be him. 

*Charlie*.

For the past couple of months, I believe I've found a method to induce astral projection. It's not entirely consistent, however, and I'm hoping to better perfect the technique.

Most of the time, AP occurs after I've had a few cups of coffee (with creamer and Splenda), and I settle down in the mid-morning/early afternoon when I start to grow tired. I'll lay down, and meditate, focusing on my breath and relaxing. 

Then, I hear this tone, or frequency, I guess. Like a high-pitch ringing in my ears, which then vibrates across my whole body. The first few times this happened in my life, I wasn't sure what was going on; I've now been able to 'float' or even stand up out of my body, and explore. 

However, this method doesn't always work, and I'm hoping to figure a way to be able to do this without feeling like I have to roll the dice, so to speak. 

1. Does the imbibing of coffee actually matter, or is it simply putting my body into a tired state? 

2. What meditative techniques, besides the ones I listed, could I also use to ensure successful AP? 

3. Now that I know what is actually occurring when I'm in the AP state, what are some recommendations on what to do, and stay within the mindset, without letting myself slip into dreaming? 

4. What exactly is this frequency/body vibration I experience before I'm able to project? Could I, through proper training, do this on command?

My best friend and I met at a mutual workplace. 
We were once coworkers. Turned friends. Turned friends with benefits. Turned feelings. Never official. And now we‚Äôre friends with NO benefits‚Ä¶ and roommates. Yeah. Crazy. I know.

Anyways, our ‚Äúsituationship‚Äù was always a love triangle because she is in love with another woman ((that‚Äôs not me)), that she ALSO met at said workplace before I came along. I for sure realize I was her rebound, but I know the feelings were real at one point. That‚Äôs not important here. 

You‚Äôre probably wondering how this involves infidelity, so let me get to it. 

My best friend still talks to the other woman, who has now been married for a few years at this point. 
And I don‚Äôt just mean ‚Äútalk.‚Äù I mean flirt, sext, phone calls, hangout, coffee and food dates, buys each other gifts for birthdays and holiday, the woman has been in the house that we share and I even caught them wallowing around in bed together‚Ä¶ and her wife did call her out for how much they text, but she doesn‚Äôt even know the HALF of it. I shouldn‚Äôt even know they talk, and the only way I know is from snooping on devices, reading through texts that I shouldn‚Äôt, and catching them in action that one time. My friend obviously doesn‚Äôt share information about her life that she has with the woman, because of all the obvious reasons. And the little bit she has shared with me, I‚Äôve told the blunt and honest truth about how dumb it is. I feel extremely guilty for snooping, believe me I do. But with my still existing feelings for my friend and just the wrongness of it all‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt help myself. I know I should stop. 

But also‚Ä¶ should I tell this woman‚Äôs wife? 
My heart hurts, truly, for her. 
I don‚Äôt want to lose my friend. But I want this to all come to an end. I think we‚Äôre all being driven crazy one way or another from it! Thanks in advance for your advice, if you can even find the words. ü•¥",2,1740361116.0,Infidelity,6,1.0,False

hiii! this is my first ever post and idk if anyone will see this but i have no idea what to do here lol. im a waitress at a small breakfast joint and we were in the middle of a rush yesterday. at one point a guy walks in, sort of drooling, and dressed up pretty nicely. i was at the register so i greeted him and asked if he was going to dine in or take out. he wanted to dine in so i was welcoming and told him he can take a seat at any small booth table. this is important. i'll be honest. i stereotyped him and thought to myself when i first saw him ""he's looking for trouble"" but i still treated him just like everyone else because he hadn't shown me any reason not to. time passes (he's not in my section so i don't interact with him at all) and i begin hearing him get rowdy on the phone with someone. i hear little bits and pieces like, ""you changed the password!!"" ""bro im a restaurant how am i supposed to pay"" ""im hungry man i need some food"". i think to myself it's an issue for my manager and keep pushing and focusing on my tables. ANOTHER important note: the customers around him began laughing at him and saying ""call security"". i'm not laughing at all but instead getting worried at the scene he's causing.

eventually he gets up and starts yelling at one of my coworkers because he never got a coffee he asked for. at this point i stop paying attention to him. what i didn't even notice (i know now because my coworkers told me) is that he left but came back.

now we get to the main issue. my back is turn to the customers because im serving coffee i two cups in one hand. suddenly i feel something hit my arm (the same one holding the coffee cups). i turn around and its the man. for some context, i had a horrible morning and opened at work so i had been up since 5 a.m, i was also pumped with adrenaline because of the rush. so in response i don't even yell, but i say ""wtf‚Äù and look at him. he's just staring at me full of hatred. i turn around and immediately start crying.

unfortunately i couldn't stop myself but i continued with my customers because i had no choice. (we only have staff that is exactly equal to the customer ratio so i couldn't take a break without messing up everyone's flow). it was really embarrassing. he began yelling about not being treated human etc etc.

now my question here is, was what he did illegal? can he get in trouble for it? but my MAIN question here is, is it worth it to try and get this man in trouble? we have cameras so there is proof that this all happened. but this man also couldn't even pay for breakfast so what good does it do to get him in legal trouble? or maybe it does do good because he can't hurt anyone else?

We hit it off right away and he swept me off my feet on our first date. I genuinely love this person and can see myself marrying him one day . 

Lately, things feel stagnant. We‚Äôve lived together for the past 6 months and have a third roommate. We‚Äôre looking at getting a place of our own this summer.

He‚Äôll cook me dinner about once a week, he‚Äôll buy me flowers every once in awhile, and he knows my favorite coffee order. But these past few months, I feel like I have a roommate more than a partner. 

The biggest struggle I am having is the cleanliness. I‚Äôm a pretty clean person. I have certain anxieties about things (e.g., the sink has to be empty and clean, I like the bed being made first thing in the morning, clothes being put away, etc.) I experience genuine anxiety if things are in disarray, and my partner knows this about me. We both have ADHD and it manifests in different ways. His ADHD is things everywhere with no rhyme or reason. He‚Äôs more of a ‚ÄúI‚Äôll do laundry once a month or so and buy more underwear if needed.‚Äù
My ADHD is having things put away and having a planner to know how to function. 

We‚Äôve had the conversation about our needs and are trying to come up with a compromise. We used to have a plan to set a few hours aside on the weekend to clean..but he hasn‚Äôt done that in months and the vast majority of the cleaning falls on me. I don‚Äôt want to clean up after my partner (I don‚Äôt want to be his mother lol), but having things in disarray causes me too much anxiety. So I usually end up spending about 3 to 4 hours on the weekend cleaning up after him and our other roommate. This is on top of the other cleaning I do everyday like putting dishes away.

**1. Cultivate a Strong Network:** It‚Äôs all about connections, buddy. Join local investment clubs, attend community gatherings, or even just strike up a convo with agents who might have pocket listings. Imagine finding out about a deal over coffee at a neighborhood cafe ‚Äì that's the power of knowing the right folks.

**2. Master the Art of Direct Mail:** Sending personalized letters can really work magic. It's like sliding into someone‚Äôs DMs, but for houses. Tell 'em why you‚Äôre interested and how you can make the process smooth. One well-written note could be the key to unlocking an off-market deal.

**3. Leverage Wholesalers:** These guys are the scouts of the real estate game. They find those hidden, undervalued properties before they hit the market. Build solid partnerships with reputable wholesalers and you‚Äôll have a steady flow of potential deals coming your way.

**4. Utilize Public Records Wisely:** Dive into property tax records or foreclosure filings to spot motivated sellers. It's like being a detective, piecing together clues that could lead you to your next investment. Sure, it takes patience, but uncovering a hidden gem makes it worth it.

**5. Attend Real Estate Auctions:** Auctions can be a goldmine for off-market properties. They're fast-paced and competitive, but you can snag a deal at a lower price if you play your cards right. Just make sure to know the rules and do your homework before you bid.

**6. Drive for Dollars:** Hop in your car and cruise through neighborhoods looking for distressed homes. Those overgrown lawns and boarded windows are like neon signs saying ""Potential Opportunity."" Drop a handwritten note in the mailbox and see what happens.

**7. Explore Probate and Estate Sales:** These sales often involve properties that need to be sold quickly, so there‚Äôs potential for off-market deals. Approach with empathy and professionalism, and keep in touch with probate attorneys who might be in the know.

**8. Invest in Tax Lien and Pre-Foreclosure Properties:** Focus on properties in financial distress to get ahead of the game before they‚Äôre publicly listed. You might buy a tax lien at auction and eventually own the property if the debt remains unpaid ‚Äì it's like playing the long game.

**9. Embrace Technology and Social Media:** Use platforms like LinkedIn or Facebook groups to connect with potential sellers or other investors who‚Äôve got the inside scoop on off-market deals. The internet‚Äôs your playground; use it to network and share insights.

**10. Understand the Legal Landscape:** Off-market deals can be complex, so get familiar with local regulations and work with a real estate attorney who knows their stuff. They're your legal GPS, making sure you don‚Äôt end up in a sticky situation.

You‚Äôve probably seen the shift already‚ÄîEEG, NIRS, intracranial pressure sensors, and all that jazz getting smashed together like a neurological mixtape. The future‚Äôs taking that and cranking it to eleven. Think real-time mashups of brain signals, oxygenation levels, and metabolic data, all feeding into AI that‚Äôs smarter than your average neurosurgeon on a coffee bender. This isn‚Äôt just about watching one metric anymore; it‚Äôs about seeing the whole damn symphony of the brain and spinal cord, live and unfiltered. Hospitals and Neuro-ICUs are already drooling over this‚Äîimagine a dashboard that screams, ‚ÄúYo, this patient‚Äôs about to tank!‚Äù before anyone even smells trouble.
Speaking of AI, that‚Äôs the next beast. Machine learning‚Äôs gonna take those mountains of data you‚Äôve been slogging through for 12 years and turn them into gold. Predictive algorithms are coming that‚Äôll spot seizures, strokes, or spinal cord ischemia faster than you can say ‚ÄúOh, shit.‚Äù Picture this: you‚Äôre in the OR, and the system‚Äôs like, ‚ÄúHey, dumbass, adjust that retractor‚Äînerve‚Äôs about to crap out.‚Äù It‚Äôs not just reactive anymore; it‚Äôs proactive, and it‚Äôs gonna save asses left and right. Companies like Soterix Medical are already flexing with FDA-cleared systems that blend AI into intraoperative neuromonitoring‚Äîexpect that to explode.
Then there‚Äôs the miniaturization and portability trend. Those clunky machines you‚Äôve been hauling around? Say goodbye. The future‚Äôs got wearable, wireless neuromonitoring rigs‚Äîthink brain-sensing headbands or tiny implants that don‚Äôt need a PhD to install. Hyperfine‚Äôs portable MRI is just the tip of the iceberg; soon, you‚Äôll have sensors so small they‚Äôll fit in a patient‚Äôs ear and still beam pristine data to your tablet while you‚Äôre chugging coffee in the break room. This is huge for real-time monitoring outside the OR‚ÄîICUs, ambulances, hell, even home care for chronic cases.
Oh, and brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are crashing the party. Neuralink‚Äôs making headlines, but neuromonitoring‚Äôs gonna ride that wave too. We‚Äôre talking next-gen implants that don‚Äôt just record but talk back to the brain‚Äîdecoding signals to predict issues or even stimulate recovery. Imagine hooking a patient up during surgery and not only watching their motor cortex but tweaking it on the fly to avoid damage. It‚Äôs like playing God with a joystick, and it‚Äôs coming faster than you think.
The market‚Äôs backing this insanity too. By 2030, intraoperative neuromonitoring alone could hit $10 billion, growing at a juicy 6-7% CAGR. Why? More neurological disorders, fancier surgeries, and a global obsession with not screwing up patients‚Äô brains. Plus, telemedicine‚Äôs sneaking in‚Äîremote neuromonitoring‚Äôs gonna let you oversee a case in Bumfuck, Nowhere from your couch while sipping a beer. That‚Äôs the dream, right?
But here‚Äôs the kicker: personalization. The future‚Äôs not just about generic data‚Äîit‚Äôs about tailoring neuromonitoring to each patient‚Äôs unique brain. Genetic profiles, past injuries, even their damn emotional state could feed into the system, giving you a custom playbook for every case. It‚Äôs like Netflix recommending your next binge, but for saving lives.
Challenges? Sure‚Äîcost‚Äôs a bitch, and integrating all this tech without turning the OR into a circus is gonna take some finesse. Plus, the ethical mess of hacking deeper into people‚Äôs heads isn‚Äôt lost on anyone. But with your experience, you‚Äôre in prime position to ride this wave‚Äîmaybe even steer it.
So, in a nutshell, neuromonitoring‚Äôs headed to a place where it‚Äôs faster, smarter, and more invasive than a nosy aunt at Thanksgiving. It‚Äôs blending with AI, shrinking down, and getting cozy with BCIs, all while trying to keep patients alive and kicking. After 12 years, you‚Äôve seen the grind‚Äînow you get to witness the glow-up. What do you think‚Äîready to strap in for the ride?‚Äù

In college, I worked 2 jobs to put myself through school, drank, went to tailgates, took weekend trips with friends. I almost never slept in high school or college. I even a computer science minor in top of my design degree. 

After graduation, I went strait to grad school, and I worked full time through that too. For years and years and years I could go days without sleep, food, or anything I could just stay awake because there was so much I wanted to do. I‚Äôm not on any ADD meds or drugs and have never taken any medicine, and barely even take aspirin or stuff like that. The only thing I did become addicted to is black coffee. 

Unfortunately during my undergrad my dad died, and at age 29 my mom died. I was depressed for a while, but my energy never returned after my mom died.

I took leave from a fancy tech job for 4 months, and got through my job alright , and even went back to socializing, working out and having lots of friends.

Emotionally I don‚Äôt feel depressed, but now it feels that I am physically dragging myself to every activity. I can now easily not move from bed for entire days, even for weeks on end. I probably have 12-15 cups of coffee a day (and sometimes Red Bull too on a bad day) , and despite eating healthy and forcing myself to exercise I just feel like shit all the time and unmotivated to do anything. 

Lately I will want to go to bed at 7pm and can sleep easily until noon, which is odd because I‚Äôve never been like this and for the majority of my life have only slept 4 or 5 hours. 

I‚Äôm also probably about 5 or so pounds underweight mainly due to a fast metabolism, so not overweight either, though likely have some stomach damage from the caffeine and know that‚Äôs slowly killing me. 

I‚Äôve been to a few doctors for checkups and blood work and outside of kind of low vitamin D they insist I‚Äôm perfectly healthy. I started taking vitamin D and have seen virtually no improvement. 

It‚Äôs driving me crazy, and I‚Äôm just not sure what to do anymore. I feel it‚Äôs somehow depression related, but I don‚Äôt seem to have emotions to match the physical symptoms.

I bought a bunch for extract, they are Grade B but still moist (not splits). I have made a TON of extract, vanilla sugar, vanilla syrup for coffee, and vanilla ice cream. I still probably have like 20 beans or so left. 
Some people said they could store it in an airtight jar and that worked. However, my beans are too tall for any jar I have. Could I cut them in half and store them without compromising them?
My other idea was to wrap them tightly in foil and put in a bag then freeze. Would that be better? I do not have a vacuum sealer so unfortunately that is not an option.

I am just struggling with a decision and need a place to vent. I had a rough last 18 months. Had 4js in October 2023. But ended up losing 3 by Feb 2024. And just lost the last one last month. 

Luckily hiring started up again in my area. I was able to land the following 

J1: 140k fully remote
J2: 168k 2 days in the office but every one coffee badges it 

I have a unique background (law degree but have been in product for 7 years) and got offered basically my dream job. I‚Äôd be a director of ai product management at a big law firm and be building out my own team. It‚Äôs 4 days in person and the salary is 240k. But i expect long hours and a lot of face to face time. 

My challenge is that i have two young children. My wife had an accident 3 years ago and has had 4 major surgeries in the last 3 years. With a major back surgery done in December. But because of her health issues i do about 90% of the child care. 

The reduction in pay would be tough because my wife has to do specialized physical therapy that is $250/session and she goes twice a week. She also has a lot of other medical expenses that we have to cover.

I love my wife and I am comfortable going the 90% do the child care. I love my kids and Im doing what i can to help her through everything she‚Äôs going through. 

But I don‚Äôt want talk to my wife about this. She would 100% tell me to go do my dream job. But I know right now isn‚Äôt the right time for this job. She needs me, my kids need me, and we need to extra money. 

I know i need to decline the role, but it‚Äôs still so hard to give up my dream job when it‚Äôs right there. Can someone just give me some validation that I‚Äôm doing the right thing. ",22,1740359053.0,overemployed,32,0.78,False

3 days ago I almost went through with something permanent. Suddenly my mom called, she said she missed me and asked if she could fly to my city after her work trip and hang out with me for a couple

Cons: 5‚Äô6, 26M who‚Äôs a pharmacist and stressed in the hospital ( had a rough road to a full time job after graduating), loans, and moved to a new city, obese, and a virgin at 26 who‚Äôs never been on a date( dating apps don‚Äôt work when fat, nobody wants to have a genuine convo if not ripped and tall) 

Despite all wrong with me I‚Äôm trying: going to gym, finally on semaglutide, going back to therapy, applying for industry jobs.

All this to say: I‚Äôm still a loser but okay with it. I‚Äôm working on getting a more enjoyable job in pharma industry, I‚Äôm hitting the gym and eating better. I‚Äôm going to a therapist again. 


Now when it comes to relationships I‚Äôm screwed but okay with it. I‚Äôm a 26 yo virgin and the dating apps don‚Äôt work. I‚Äôll get fit but I‚Äôll never be jacked. 

I don‚Äôt love clubs, I love coffee shops, and bookstores, and sports.I love cooking, and trivia.  I‚Äôm the type of guy who consider his mom his best friend. I‚Äôm not gonna be the masculine badass women are gonna wanna date or hookup with. But I‚Äôm gonna keep working on me.

I'm buzzing with excitement today! Let‚Äôs dive into a world where AI is shaking hands with corporate training, paving a path akin to the Yellow Brick Road for enhanced employee development programs. If this sounds futuristic, well, we're living it NOW! ü§ñ‚ú®

**üöÄ The AI Revolution in Corporate Training: A Game Changer**

AI isn‚Äôt just a trending buzzword; it‚Äôs becoming the backbone of dynamic employee development. Why stick to mundane, traditional training methods when AI offers a playground of innovation? With AI, corporate training leaps from static lectures to vibrant, interactive learning experiences. üåÄ

**üí° Customizing Learning Experiences: The AI Way**

The magic of AI lies in its ability to tailor learning paths. Imagine an AI-driven mentor that adapts to individual learning styles, needs, and paces. Employees can now embark on personalized learning journeys, unlocking their greatest potential without the rigid, one-size-fits-all methods of yore. üß©

Think back to a time when a standardized training approach just didn‚Äôt click with you. Now, imagine the opposite‚Äîa setup crafted by an AI that understands your strengths, weaknesses, and curiosity levels.

**üïí Efficient and Flexible Learning: Anytime, Anywhere**

Who doesn‚Äôt love flexibility? AI-integrated training programs transform professional development into an on-the-go opportunity. Whether you're sipping coffee at your desk or commuting home, AI-based platforms provide bite-sized, engaging content that effortlessly fits into your schedule. üï∂Ô∏èüì±

I recall juggling numerous tasks, pining for flexible development options that could adapt to my ever-changing calendar. AI now offers that solution, making knowledge increasingly accessible, whenever and wherever!

**ü§ù AI's Human Touch: Enhancing Engagement**

One might argue AI could take the 'human' out of human resources. Paradoxically, AI enhances the human aspect. By handling administrative tasks, AI allows trainers to focus on building meaningful connections and fostering high-touch engagements with employees. üë´üí¨

In my previous gig, having the AI handle scheduling left me with more bandwidth to concentrate on fostering personal growth and motivation among my colleagues‚Äîpriceless experiences indeed!

**üöÄ Ready to Revolutionize Your Training Programs?**

AI in corporate training isn‚Äôt just a leap‚Äîit‚Äôs a quantum leap! Ready to enhance your company's training landscape with the latest in AI technology? Start exploring and discover how you can integrate these innovative solutions into your development programs. Let's lead the charge in revolutionizing employee education! üîß‚ú®

Or does anyone have insight into why someone would do this?

I realized my Nmom did this A LOT‚Äîeven going to far as naming some of my siblings after siblings on a TV show. Of course, none of these personalities or decisions ever affected her choice to degrade and abuse me and my siblings, but it was still odd in retrospect. For example, when she got really into ‚ÄúDownton Abbey‚Äù, for that entire time we were not allowed to sit on the couch to eat dinner as we had for years before. Instead, we were to sit on the floor at the coffee table using proper etiquette and posture despite not knowing things like that a salad fork as. God help us if we did it wrong though. When the go to dinner show went back to something like ‚ÄúFamily Guy‚Äù, suddenly we didn‚Äôt have to eat like that anymore. (Side note‚Äîwhenever she switched to a new show, everybody had a TV character ‚Äúequivalent‚Äù and was treated as such. Being a teenager was a bad time to be dubbed ‚ÄúMeg‚Äù.)

I watched an episode of ‚ÄúCastle‚Äù for the first time in years, and remembered my Nmom saying she was going to get her hair cut like Beckett‚Äôs. That alone is not totally odd, but she altered her voice and speaking mannerisms to match Beckett‚Äôs, tried to be more edgy and interrogative, and started likening my stepdad to Castle. Rinse and repeat for so many other shows. With ‚ÄúLaw & Order‚Äù, she do things similar to what I‚Äôve mentioned above, and would go on and on about how much she wanted to be a lawyer‚Äîso much that she would go on to represent herself in custody cases. With ‚ÄúGreat British Bake Off‚Äù, absolutely everything had to be baked and critiqued, whether that was welcomed or not. With ‚ÄúHouse‚Äù, she just got all ditsy and fangirled over my stepdad suddenly having a license to be an absolute dick to us. The list goes on and on.

I‚Äôve been no-contact with her for years, and I‚Äôve got therapy in a few days, but I just wanted to ask if anyone else has experienced this weirdness too.",1,1740358525.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False
1iwpkiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_JudgeFirm9764/comments/1iwpkiv/late_day_breaks_and_dinner/,Late day Breaks and Dinner.,"As we moved down the street, it was calm, it felt like we walked for miles, just chatting and enjoying the sights and sounds of life, we moved back through the park, the sun was starting to come down, settling itself in for the evening. 

She had a calm demeanor about her, I don‚Äôt think I had ever seen that happy or content. It was good to see, When she was around him, she seemed stressed, I never approached her while they were together out of respect, but I could feel the energy and it felt like she didn‚Äôt really want to be with him. I guess maybe I was over thinking a bit, sprinkled with a bit of wishful thinking. 

But she was calm, like she could take on the world again, knowing someone was there right behind her. Maybe that was peace of mind enough. I couldn‚Äôt say. I didn‚Äôt want to pry, I wanted to make sure she felt comfortable and push her worries off to the side, if even it was only briefly. 

‚ÄúSo I know you want to do this dinner thing, and I‚Äôm still down for it, but I was gonna run home, shower quick, and take care of laundry at my place, week is about to start and I wanna have my Ts crossed and I‚Äôs dotted.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWow, are you in my head? I was thinking the same thing. How about that ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚Äù 

‚ÄúPossibly, but not really, did you have any pressing issues before tonight?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNope, my laundry is done and I‚Äôm ready for the week.‚Äù 

‚ÄúOkay awesome, then will you do a favor for me quick? Do you mind? If it‚Äôs too much, no worries I‚Äôll take care of it.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs up?‚Äù 

‚ÄúHere take my debit card, do you want to run to the store and pick up some groceries? Stuff for tonight?‚Äù

She gave me a look of confusion..

‚ÄúAre you sure? That‚Äôs a lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúYea I trust ya, figured we could kill two birds with one stone type deal, if you‚Äôre not comfortable with it, that‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôm fairly quick, so I can make the trip while laundry is going.‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo it‚Äôs okay I got it, but wow.‚Äù 

‚ÄúHehe‚Äù I couldn‚Äôt help but giggle, but I trusted her at this point. However I wasn‚Äôt trying to just barge my way into her life, or make any expectations of her, given everything else going on, it might have been a little much. 

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the pin?‚Äù She said as she reached her hand out to me.

‚Äú0000, I know creative right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI wasn‚Äôt going to say anything but that feels like a you thing to do üòÇ‚Äù 

‚ÄúYea I like to keep it simple.‚Äù 

‚ÄúSame‚Äù she gave a smile and a wink. ‚ÄúSo what time were you thinking?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell it‚Äôs 5:30 now, how about 8? Gives us both some time apart, but not for long.‚Äù 

‚ÄúI like that idea, don‚Äôt get me wrong, I enjoy your company, but space is always good too‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly!‚Äù I said in a relieved manner. 

‚ÄúGet what you want, it‚Äôs on me.‚Äù 

‚ÄúAre you sure? I‚Äôm not gonna owe you anything after am I?‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell maybe a kiss, but you got kids, I wouldn‚Äôt want to just expect you to shell out of your pocket, especially when little ones are involved.‚Äù 

‚ÄúWell what about you?‚Äù She asked? 

‚ÄúMy kids are fine, they got lots to choose from, if I was worried I wouldn‚Äôt have offered.‚Äù 

At this point I‚Äôm not sure if she wanted to hug me, break down and cry or what, but her energy shifted, I felt it. 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre nuts you know that right?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt say nuts, just empathetic and understanding, As I said always at your pace‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou keep saying that, I know what you mean, but why?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBecause I would never put you in a position to make you uncomfortable, and if I do, let me know so I can change it, I am terrible at hint‚Äôs plus I‚Äôm kinda traditional in some ways when it comes to.. what ever this is. I pay for food, etc. yea a little old school but it has its place I think.‚Äù 

‚ÄúDo you want anything specific while I‚Äôm out? 

‚ÄúNot that I can think of, get what ya want, I gotta run and take care of some stuff, see ya in a while?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYea.. a whileüòò‚Äù 

I made sure to get her back to her place, giving her a kiss as I left, she had a look of longing and wonder in her eyes as I walked back home. 

I hurried back as quick as I could, plans were set and I got to work, I stripped, got into the shower and cleaned up quick, making sure to trim myself up in the process. Scratchy face isn‚Äôt much fun, especially for the opposite sex, no matter where you‚Äôre kissing. 

Once I hopped out of the shower, I got a text from her, ‚Äúhey I‚Äôm at the store do you want any kind of coffee for the morning?‚Äù

‚ÄúOhh yea, will you grab some hazelnut coffee and creamer, I have a thing for it. Lol‚Äù

‚ÄúSure thing, anything else?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNaa, can‚Äôt think of anything, thank you!‚Äù 

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome. See you soon.‚Äù 

I quickly got my laundry in the washer, did a few chores around the house and basically waited for a little while, there was little more I could do, I‚Äôll have to admit I felt bad thinking about it, she was out shopping and I was sitting down doing the ‚Äúhurry up and wait‚Äù game. 

I had about another hour and a half to go. Things were running smooth. The only thing I could do was be patient. 

With that I put on the TV, waiting on laundry and for 8 to get here sooner rather than later.. ",1,1740358487.0,u_JudgeFirm9764,1,1.0,False

‚ÄúShut up.‚Äù I had been awake for a little while, just staring at the wall.

‚ÄúI knew it.‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you not sleep?‚Äù I rolled over and looked at him as I asked the question.

James was in his rocking chair in the corner of our bedroom right next to the window. The moon outside was illuminating his face.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm ok. Just a lot on my mind.‚Äù

‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù I did my best to sit up. I was almost at my due date and I was enormous. During the pregnancy I wasn‚Äôt quite as sensitive to his little issues that I normally was.

James suffered from severe bouts of anxiety and he would spend lots of nights just rocking in his chair, trying not to worry about things.

‚ÄúI think we should get a dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe should get a dog. Every kid should grow up with a dog.‚Äù He turned his head to look at me. Most of his face was in shadow, but his eyes were bright. He smiled at me.

‚ÄúOk. Is that it? That‚Äôs what‚Äôs keeping you up?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes. Oh, and I also love you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI love you too.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd I farted.‚Äù I had never known James to end anything on any kind of sappy note, so he always had to say or do something childish to ruin the moment.¬†

I loved him so much.¬†



\-

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs kind of gross.‚Äù There were so many dogs at the shelter, but my husband immediately went to the mangiest one. A large mutt with his tongue hanging limply out of the side of his mouth. The mousey brown fur looked like someone had teased it with a brush and sealed the deal with an entire can of hairspray, and he had a slight limp as it walked toward this strange new man making baby talk. I watched the dog cock its head from side to side like it understood what James was saying.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs perfect.‚Äù I could tell that James was in love.

‚ÄúWhy him?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶every other little guy in here is so animated and vibrant. He‚Äôs‚Ä¶um‚Ä¶not.‚Äù

‚ÄúHe looks like an oversized mouse with bad hair.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs perfect!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can name him Feivel! Does Feivel like that name?! Who‚Äôs a bugaboo doggie?! Who‚Äôs da doggie?!‚Äù The dog started making inquisitive whines and that lazy tongue came to life and began to lick the strange man's fingers through the chain link fence.

Feivel came home with us, and for a month that dog never left my husband‚Äôs side.¬†

\-

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù

‚ÄúCan you put me on speaker so Art can hear me?‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. You‚Äôre scaring me Katherine.‚Äù I was trying to hold it together. James‚Äô parents had recently moved to the east coast, so I had no choice but to call them on the phone with the news. ‚ÄúOk, you‚Äôre on speaker.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. James‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ James had an accident. It was a hit and run. Someone hit him with a car while he was crossing the street and then just kept driving.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh my God! Is he alright?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs um‚Ä¶‚Äù I had been with James since our sophomore year in high school, but we had been friends since we were six. I had known his parents for almost just as long.¬†

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs‚Ä¶he‚Äôs gone.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOh my God‚Ä¶‚Äù

I had to make lots of phone calls that day. It was the hardest day of my life.

\-

‚ÄúMommy needs to talk to you.‚Äù

Feivel had been pacing the house for three days. When he wasn‚Äôt pacing, he would just sit at the front door waiting for James to come home. He wouldn't sit with me, almost like he blamed me for James not being there.

‚ÄúCome here. Feivel! Come here.‚Äù He finally gave in and walked over to the couch. I patted the cushion next to me and he jumped on the couch and sat down.

He grunted at me several times and when he was done voicing his frustrations, his tongue jutted out of the side of his mouth and just hung there.

I don‚Äôt know if it sounds stupid or not, but I had a conversation with him about what had happened to his Daddy and why he wasn‚Äôt with us anymore. I felt like it would have been cruel not to.

He stared at me through the whole story and when I was finished, there was a heavy silence between us that was eventually broken by a small cry from him before he put his head in my lap.¬†

\-

Three weeks later, I had Casey. The birth was rough and there were multiple issues. For a little bit there, I was afraid that I might lose her too. She had to stay in the hospital longer than I would have liked, but when I was finally able to bring her home, Feivel took to her instantly.

He was always next to her.

\-

As the years went by, I made sure Casey knew every detail about her father. I would tell her stories and Feivel would always add something in his own language. I don‚Äôt know if he was backing up what I said or perhaps contradicting it, but I do know he was always happy to be included in the reminiscing.¬†

Shortly after she turned four, Casey‚Äôs favorite pastime was drawing with her crayons. I had quite a few pictures up on our fridge of our little family in the midst of imagined adventures. She always drew James in with us. The way she always emphasized his balding head would make me smile.

I would BBQ on Friday nights because James had always done the same.¬†

When we first moved in, he had built a huge grilling station out of brick and bought this ridiculously large grill that could almost fit an entire cow inside of it. James had said we would need it for the amount of children and grandchildren that we were going to have. We would sit in front of it every Friday night with a bottle of whiskey while he cooked.

Casey and I would sit at the same table and have juice while we made hot dogs. I thought it was important to keep some of our traditions alive for Casey.¬†

In spite of losing James, we were happy. I started to adjust to a life without a partner, which was not a very easy thing to do since we had been a part of each other‚Äôs lives since we were both six years old.

\-¬†

Almost five years after I lost James, I met Stephen. I was a busy woman with a young daughter and up to that point, I had not even thought about dating. There was something different about Stephen though. I was interested in him from the first time we met.

Casey and I were playing in the park with Feivel one day and somehow we lost him. He just vanished. I looked for him for hours while my mom watched Casey, but I couldn‚Äôt find him. For three days I was beside myself and Casey was constantly in tears. Then, Stephen showed up on my doorstep holding our Feivel at the end of a leash.

A tall man with thick hair and trendy glasses wearing a flannel and jeans.

‚ÄúOh my God!‚Äù

‚ÄúHi. I uh‚Ä¶found him in the park down by the river.‚Äù I snatched him up and he started whimpering and shaking his butt back and forth. I completely ignored the man at my door. When Feivel had had enough of my pets, he ran inside to look for Casey.

‚ÄúThank you so much. Oh my God, you have no idea how much we missed him.‚Äù I was wiping tears from my eyes.

‚ÄúOh, I might have a clue.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem.‚Äù

As I was wiping my nose on the sleeve of my sweatshirt, I realized that the man standing at my door was gorgeous.

‚ÄúCan I‚Ä¶let me give you some money or something. You have no idea how happy you just made my daughter.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, that's ok. Just happy to help.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù¬†

There was something about the way he looked at me with his eyes. My stomach fluttered. I wanted to invite him in, and the fact that I wanted to do that upset me.

I thanked him. I didn‚Äôt even ask him for his name. I‚Äôll admit that I even closed the door on him a little more abruptly than I meant to.

All three of us shared my bed that night. It was the best night‚Äôs sleep I‚Äôd had in years.

\-

A couple weeks went by and then I saw him again, the man who had found Feivel. He was sitting in the park with his back against a tree, reading a book. Casey and I had been taking turns throwing a frisbee for Feivel, and I saw him out of the corner of my eye. I decided that I would thank him again and apologize for being so awkward.

As I walked closer, I took in every detail. I was sure he was a few years younger than I was and he looked very athletic. His glasses rested on the tip of his nose as he read from *The Winter of Our Discontent*; Steinbeck has always been my favorite author.

Feivel must have seen him just as I was about to say something because he reached the man before I did. I could hear Casey calling for me.

‚ÄúHold on honey. Give me a second.‚Äù¬†

Feivel was all over the man and he was laughing at the writhing whining beast who was trying its best to lick every inch of his face.

‚ÄúFeivel, don‚Äôt be rude.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, it's fine. I‚Äôm glad he remembers me.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah. Wow, he really remembers you.‚Äù Feivel was so excited that he started to whimper and expose his tummy. ‚ÄúFeivel! Have some self respect!‚Äù

The man stood up next to me. My stomach was fluttering again and I could not stop looking at his eyes.¬†

‚ÄúHey, I have to apologize about‚Ä¶uh the way I kinda shut my door in your face.‚Äù He laughed.

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt have to apologize.‚Äù

‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù Casey had run up behind me and was partially hiding herself behind my leg while she stared at the man. ‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is my daughter Casey.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello Casey.‚Äù

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMy name‚Äôs Stephen.‚Äù Casey stayed behind my leg.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs ok honey. Tell him your name.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Casey and this is my mom. Her name is Katherine.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶you‚Äôre a very pretty girl and it‚Äôs very nice to meet you.‚Äù I noticed that his eyes started to tear up while he was looking at my Casey. He wiped his eyes and shook his head. He was clearly embarrassed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. She just‚Ä¶ reminds me of my niece. We lost her a few years ago.‚Äù

We talked for a while that day. Every time he looked over at Casey, I swore that he was on the verge of tears.

\-

It didn‚Äôt take very long at all; I was hooked. Feivel was hooked. Eventually, even Casey was hooked.

I tried to take it slow. I didn‚Äôt want to date anyone. I wasn‚Äôt over James and I knew it, but I just wanted to be around this man and I honestly could not explain what it was at the time. I always wanted him at the house, so he was there all the time. I loved it when he looked at me.

For the most part, he was great, but there were some things that were off. There were things I should have paid more attention to, but again, there was something about him that made me feel like I needed him.

He would kiss me with his eyes open every time, and even though the way he kissed me was great, something about it still gave me the creeps. I would crack my eyes open sometimes in the hopes that he had stopped doing it. Every time I saw those eyes staring back at me, I felt uneasy. I had only ever been with James, so I thought maybe some guys just did that, even though all of my friends thought it was weird too.¬†

He also did things when he would come over that would raise the hairs on the back of my neck. Maybe that description is a little too harsh for what I was thinking at the time, but it fits now.

He would move things around the house. The toilet paper would be folded in that terrible triangle every time. James used to do that. He would also randomly adjust my coffee cups in the cabinet so the handles all faced the same way. Again, something my James used to do.¬†

I had no idea what he did for a living, he told me he was in construction, but I had no idea who he worked for. He had never invited me over to his house, nor did he ever talk about his family.

My friends told me that I needed to relax and just enjoy myself. I admit, for the most part he seemed like the almost perfect guy. It was almost like he knew everything about me.

\-

It was three months before he stayed overnight. I had Casey stay over at my mother‚Äôs house because it didn‚Äôt feel right to have her there.

We tried to be intimate, but I felt dirty. He said it was fine. He stayed anyway.¬†

In the middle of the night I rolled over and cracked my eyes open. He was in the rocking chair in the corner. The moon was illuminating his eyes while he looked out the window. I thought I was dreaming for a minute.¬†

‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre awake‚Ä¶Katherine‚Ä¶Katherine?‚Äù¬†

I didn‚Äôt say anything. I pretended to sleep. He turned his face to me and smiled. His eyes were so wide and bright.

‚ÄúKatherine?‚Äù

I never went back to sleep that night. I just laid there for a while going back and forth from feeling like I was betraying my husband to feeling like I was an idiot who should just enjoy having a relationship with someone.

Around four in the morning, I had finally begun to drift off to sleep, but Stephen started making noises.

I rolled over and realized that his eyes were wide open. I was going to say something, but he was asleep. I waved my hand in front of his face to make sure.

He began to grunt and his body would shake every now and then. He was having a bad dream and his open eyes began darting back and forth.

‚ÄúGet out of my head‚Ä¶‚Äù He whispered it twice. ‚ÄúFuck you‚Ä¶out of my head‚Ä¶Mine now‚Ä¶‚Äù

It was too much to take. I quietly slid off of the bed and backed my way out of the room. Just as I made it to my door, his eyes moved and focused on me. He was still asleep, but it was like his eyes were watching me just the same.

¬†I walked downstairs. He continued to talk in his sleep for over an hour. I was pretty sure right then that I had to break it off, or at least really slow down. I just didn‚Äôt feel right. And to be honest, I was a little creeped out.

\-



¬†I was drinking my coffee in the kitchen and thinking about what I was going to say when something caught my eye. Casey‚Äôs pictures of our family on the fridge looked different.I got up and took a closer look. James had been changed in every picture. He didn‚Äôt have short hair anymore, it was full and he was also wearing glasses. My heart skipped a beat and I felt a terrible lump in my throat. I wondered what this man had said to my daughter to convince her to remove her father from the pictures. I was done.

A few minutes later, he came downstairs in a rush. He was wearing a black Flogging Molly t-shirt. James‚Äô favorite shirt.¬†

‚ÄúWhat are you doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood morning! I forgot to turn on the alarm! I‚Äôm going to be late for work!‚Äù

‚ÄúStephen, why are you wearing that shirt?‚Äù

‚ÄúI found it in your closet.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut why are you wearing it?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell in case you forgot, I ripped the one I was wearing last night.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs shirt.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh come on, he‚Äôs not going to be wearing it anytime soon. I gotta go, I‚Äôll see you after work.‚Äù He leaned in for a kiss, but I backed away. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the matter?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think this is going to work out.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI think we need to take a break.‚Äù

‚ÄúOver a t-shirt?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a lot of things Stephen.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you being fucking serious with me right now?‚Äù His voice raised, something I had not yet experienced with him. Something in my head told me to back away from him, so I did. I backed right up against the counter within reach of my knives. It made me feel better.

‚ÄúI think so.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I don‚Äôt want to do that. Tell me what I did and I‚Äôll fix it. I‚Äôll take off the shirt. Katherine‚Ä¶please.‚Äù I looked right into his eyes. I thought maybe I was overreacting, but the pictures, messing with my daughter to erase her father, that was the breaking point.

‚ÄúPlease leave.‚Äù

The kindness in his face fell away to an ugliness that made me start to tremble. He noticed it. A smile slowly started to rise and it looked like he was going to take a step closer. I rested my hand on the counter behind me, inches from the knife block. He halted and stood still.

‚ÄúFeivel!‚Äù My dog ran into the kitchen at the sound of my voice and looked back and forth between us. I could tell that he sensed the tension. Feivel walked over to my side and just looked back at Stephen without making a sound.

‚ÄúAre you going to sick the dog on me? Are you crazy or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúStephen, I just want you to leave.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúI thought I did everything right.‚Äù He let out a sigh. ‚ÄúI had all the answers. I know everything about you and I still can‚Äôt make it work. This cannot be my fault‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶it‚Äôs your fault! Why are you doing this?!‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave. Now.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶I just‚Ä¶‚Äù He started laughing and looked down. He tapped my husband's shirt. ‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶shit‚Ä¶ I tried to fuck Katherine, and all I got was this lousy tshirt‚Ä¶is that how this going to end?‚Äù He just stared at me. I wouldn‚Äôt answer him. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think so. You‚Äôre going to change your mind.‚Äù He turned and walked out of the door, slamming it behind him.

After he left, I locked all of the doors and called my mother. I told her what happened and not to take Casey to daycare. I told her that I would be able to pick her up in just a little bit. I called all my friends and let them know what happened. I basically wanted to hear other people tell me that Stephen was nuts and in the event that something happened to me, I wanted people to know where to look first.

I ripped all of Casey‚Äôs drawings off of the fridge and crumpled them up and threw them away.

I walked back upstairs to get dressed and I noticed other things.

I had only kept a few clothes that belonged to my husband and some of them were missing. I had a small jewelry box on the bathroom counter, and most of the rings and necklaces that James had given me were also missing. I walked through the house and began to notice random little things were missing here and there and the only thing they all had in common were that they were gifts given to me by James.

\-

Before I picked up Casey at my mother‚Äôs, I called the police to see if anything could be done, even though I was pretty sure that I knew the answer. Other than being a creep and a thief, Stephen actually hadn‚Äôt done anything. There was nothing the police could do.

I took Casey to the park to explain to her why Stephen wouldn‚Äôt be around anymore. Feivel was sitting next to her in the backseat. I started by asking her about her drawings.

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt change them.‚Äù

‚ÄúCasey, honey, I saw them this morning. They‚Äôre changed. You changed the way daddy looks.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut I didn‚Äôt mommy. I wouldn‚Äôt do that. Maybe Stephen did it.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou think Stephen took your crayons and changed your drawings?‚Äù

‚ÄúMaybe. He thought he was going to be my new daddy anyway, so maybe he thought it was a good idea.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait. Who said he was going to be your new daddy?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe did. He said it lots.‚Äù

When we got to the park, I made sure Casey stayed right next to me. We started throwing the frisbee down by the river so Feivel could play in the water if he wanted. I asked her some more questions about Stephen and anything else he might have said to her. It didn‚Äôt sound like he had said much more.¬†

We were about to leave when Casey started waving at something.

‚ÄúLook Mommy, it‚Äôs Stephen!‚Äù¬†

He was standing on the other side of the river, and he was waving back to us. He was wearing a button up shirt and a pair of jeans that both belonged to my husband. He was smiling at me.

‚ÄúMommy?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you mad at Stephen or something?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes honey. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre going to be talking to Stephen anymore. I think he needs to go away.‚Äù I reached down and scooped up my daughter and began to walk back toward our car.¬†

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going home. Come on Feivel! Feivel?‚Äù My dog had been staring at Stephen and he still hadn‚Äôt moved. ‚ÄúFeivel, come!‚Äù

Stephen whistled and that was enough for Feivel. He jumped into the river and began swimming toward the other side. I called after him over and over, but he eventually made it to the other side and ran over to Stephen. He gave me one last wave before he reached down and clipped a leash onto Feivel‚Äôs collar. He turned around and started to walk away.¬†

I ran back to the car and put Casey in her car seat as fast as I could and I drove to the parking lot on the other side of the river, but by the time I got there, he was gone with our dog.¬†

\-

I filled out a report with the police and tried to get a restraining order.

‚ÄúOk, so here‚Äôs the problem. You said his name was Stephen Tasavo?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk look. This is not going to make you feel any better, but this man doesn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

‚ÄúHe gave you a false name, Miss. Couldn‚Äôt find anybody by that name fitting his description. You got him on social media anywhere? Does he have any friends?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know. I don‚Äôt have any of that crap. Social media I mean. I guess I just‚Ä¶never asked him about any of it. We‚Äôve only been seeing each other for a few months.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, from the pictures you took on your phone, we know what he looks like. We‚Äôre going to keep an eye out for him, whoever he is. I suggest you keep your doors locked and inform the people at your daughter‚Äôs school. If there‚Äôs anywhere else you can go, I don‚Äôt think that would be a bad idea.‚Äù



I went home that night anyway. Casey was a mess after Stephen took Feivel and I thought that it would be a mistake if I didn‚Äôt give her some sense of normalcy. I had four friends stay with me that night.¬†

\-

A month later I got a call from a number that I didn‚Äôt recognize.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt hang up the phone Katherine. Feivel really wants to hear your voice.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou sick fuck! Give me back my dog!‚Äù He was quiet for a moment.¬†

‚ÄúI've got you on speaker and you‚Äôre saying nasty things like that. He can hear everything you‚Äôre saying. Can‚Äôt you?! Can‚Äôt you?! Who‚Äôs a bugaboo doggie?! Who‚Äôs da doggie?!‚Äù

‚ÄúStephen‚Ä¶I‚Äôll do whatever you want‚Ä¶please just give him back to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on Katherine. I know you know that‚Äôs not my name.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat is your name?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou know, I thought I had to become someone else to be with you. But I don‚Äôt think so. I‚Äôm going to like you getting to know the real me.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease just give me my dog.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to make you see that it was destiny that your husband died. I‚Äôm going to make you see that his death was what it took to bring us together.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou son of a bitch!‚Äù

‚ÄúAnyway, I‚Äôll see you soon.‚Äù He hung up the phone.

I called the police, and after that night, I didn‚Äôt hear anything from Stephen for two months. Two months of looking over my shoulder. Two months of waiting.

I bought a gun. I kept it in the drawer of my bedside table. I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances.

\-

I woke up with a start in the middle of the night and I heard the sound of muffled whining. I sat up in bed and looked around my bedroom before I grabbed the gun and got up. I walked to my window and noticed that it was slightly open. I looked down into the backyard.

Smoke was pouring out from underneath the closed lid on the grill. It looked like something was tied around the handles in order to keep it shut. I ran downstairs to the patio door. I opened it and held the gun in front of me. The smell of something burning was making me sick to my stomach. Something was crying out inside of the grill, frantically trying to get out. My heart sank as I realized that it was Feivel‚Äôs collar tied around the handle.

I screamed and grabbed the hose and turned it on. I lunged for the lid of the grill and I burned my hands as I tore away the collar from the handles.

I threw the top to the grill open and sprayed the hose inside. Feivel leapt out of the grill and down onto the brick patio. I soaked him with the hose. A belt had been tied around his muzzle. I ripped it off of his face and kept the water on him.¬†

I turned to look back at the house. I didn‚Äôt want to leave him, but I realized that I had left my phone upstairs. I opened my mouth to scream for help, but then I had a hard time making any sound when I saw what was on the patio table. There was a bottle of whiskey on it with two glasses that had already been poured. There was a note on the table.

*‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Friday Night! Time to BBQ!‚Äù*

There was also something else on the table. A small fake rock. James and I had always kept it hidden amongst the other rocks in the backyard. It had a small compartment on the underside where we kept a spare key to our house. Stephen was in our house.

I looked back down to Feivel. I was left with the awful decision of having to leave my dog. He was gasping for air, but he was still alive. I had to get to Casey to make sure she was safe.

‚ÄúFeivel, I‚Äôm sorry!‚Äù I left the hose laying across him and I ran back inside.

As I ran up the stairs, I saw that Casey‚Äôs door was closed and as I reached out for the knob, I heard a familiar noise coming from my room. The sound of a rocking chair. I cracked open Casey‚Äôs door and I could see that she was still asleep in her bed.

‚ÄúKaaaatheriiiiine‚Ä¶‚Äù

I closed the door and held the gun in front of me as I walked into my room.

The man I knew as Stephen was rocking in my husband's chair, wearing my husband‚Äôs clothes, and holding a house key that only myself and my husband knew about.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve missed you so much.‚Äù I raised the gun without saying a word. My hand was shaking. He was smiling and rocking back and forth. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not going to shoot me.‚Äù

‚ÄúGoodbye Stephen.‚Äù I pulled the trigger and nothing happened but a dry snap. I pulled the trigger again, but nothing happened.

‚ÄúIf you held that thing more often, you could probably tell that it‚Äôs just a little heavier when it has bullets in it.‚Äù

I lunged for my bedside table and pulled the drawer open. The small box of bullets was gone.¬†

‚ÄúI unloaded it while you were asleep.‚Äù He stood up. I ran for Casey‚Äôs door, but he caught me before I could open it. I felt his hand go over my mouth and he picked me up by my shoulders. I struggled as he carried me closer to the top of the stairs.

‚ÄúI‚Äôve watched you sleep for so many nights now, just wondering how I could get you back. But I think there might not be any saving of what we had.‚Äù He hit me across the face and threw me down the stairs.

I heard my ankles snap when I hit the floor, and I screamed. His footsteps were quiet as he started walking down the stairs.

‚ÄúWe could have had a life together. I really wanted that. I even put something on the grill, but then you went and ruined that too.‚Äù

‚ÄúMommy?!‚Äù Casey had run out of her bedroom and was at the top of the stairs looking down on us. Stephen was just a few steps away from me. I started to crawl along the floor toward the kitchen.

‚ÄúGo back to your room Casey. You‚Äôre mother and I are fighting.‚Äù

‚ÄúCasey! Get Mommy‚Äôs phone and call for help!‚Äù I screamed, as I pulled myself along the floor and into the kitchen. All I could think of was getting to the block of knives.



‚ÄúWhere do you think you're going off to? Wait, I know‚Ä¶‚Äù

Stephen ran around me and to the kitchen counter. He picked up the block of knives and spilled them on the floor. ‚ÄúCome and get ‚Äòem Katherine.‚Äù

He walked back over and stood over me while I crawled toward the knives. He was laughing.

‚ÄúTo think, if someone hadn‚Äôt killed your husband, none of this would have happened.‚Äù

I tried to shut his voice out of my head as I crawled forward. I was getting closer.

‚ÄúYou know the person who hit him did actually stop for a moment‚Ä¶just a moment‚Ä¶he opened his car door and almost ran over to help, but then something stopped him. Did you know that?‚Äù

He‚Äôs lying Kathering. Keep moving.

‚ÄúI was there. If I close my eyes, I can still see the whole thing. If that guy had helped instead of just driving away, maybe James would have survived and what I‚Äôve had with you and Casey‚Ä¶ all that would never have been.‚Äù¬†

I was right in front of the pile of knives. I reached out and then he stomped on my hand. I felt bones break. He leaned down, grabbed me, and turned me over to look at him. He was crying.

‚ÄúI still think it was destiny that brought us together, but I was wrong about you. You don‚Äôt have any place in our family. Me and Casey. I‚Äôm going to take her far away from here. She‚Äôs mine now.‚Äù Tears were pouring out of his eyes and he was trying to blink them away, but the tears wouldn‚Äôt stop.

‚ÄúSon of a bitch! Stop it! Stop it!‚Äù He rubbed at his eyes with one hand. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs mine now!‚Äù

I brought my knee up as hard as I could between his legs and he dropped me to the floor. He fell to his knees right next to me. I could hear sirens outside.



I reached out and grabbed the largest knife. I raised it over my head, but before I could swing it down, he grabbed my wrist and started to squeeze. I felt my grip start to loosen and I was afraid that I was going to drop the knife. He started to laugh as the sirens were getting closer.

‚ÄúLooks like it‚Äôs time we get things over with.‚Äù

I felt his body slam against mine, and at first I had no idea what had happened, but then Stephen began to scream and I could hear Feivel growling behind him.¬†

Feivel had managed to fit his jaws around the back of Stephen‚Äôs neck and buried his teeth to the gums. He was pulling Stephen away from me; blood poured down either side of his throat.

I tightened my grip on the knife and I pushed it into Stephen‚Äôs stomach over and over and over again. Feivel eventually let go of Stephen, and as I continued to plunge the knife into the mushy mess I had made, my dog limped over and started to whimper.

As Stephen lay there gasping for breath, I stared at his eyes. They were staring back at me and he was no longer weeping. I felt crazy, but his eyes looked kind. They looked happy.

\-

‚ÄúHow are you feeling now?‚Äù I remember the detective had this perfect voice. A Paul Winfield voice. Had the things he was about to tell me weren‚Äôt so terrible, I would probably only remember how beautiful that voice was.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt walk, but they‚Äôve got me so drugged up that I don‚Äôt mind very much. I‚Äôm going to be able to go home tomorrow. Or‚Ä¶to my mother‚Äôs at least.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow‚Äôs your daughter doing?‚Äù

‚ÄúShe‚Äôs good. She‚Äôs staying with my mother.‚Äù

‚ÄúI hear that hero dog is going to pull through.‚Äù

I smiled. Tears started coming up thinking of Feivel sitting somewhere without me while he was going through all this.

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not going to be a hundred percent, but he‚Äôs going to have a good life. He deserves it.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. Now for the unpleasant stuff. We finally got some answers on who this guy is. Was, excuse me. His name is Joshua Linder. He‚Äôs been keeping a small apartment only a mile away from your house for the last three years. It looks like he‚Äôs been watching you the whole time. All kinds of things all over his apartment.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid he kill James?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. He couldn't have. Up until three years ago he lived across the country from you. Even then, there was no way he was driving the car that killed your husband. He was legally blind.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot completely blind, but may as well have been. That is his connection to you, and to your late husband I‚Äôm afraid.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou said he knew things he shouldn‚Äôt have right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYes.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere the spare key was, um‚Ä¶ certain things you shared with your late husband, correct?‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs right.‚Äù

‚ÄúKatherine, there‚Äôs no easy way to say this, so I‚Äôm just going to say it. You are aware that your husband was an organ donor, were you not?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt seems that uh‚Ä¶ Mr. Linder was the recipient of your husband‚Äôs corneas after your husband passed. Now how he found out about you, we have no idea. There‚Äôs some kind of phenomenon that‚Äôs called cellular memory that frankly I think is‚Ä¶‚Äù

He kept talking, but the only thing on my mind were Stephen‚Äôs eyes.

\-

My little family of three moved far away from home. We now have a house next to my husband‚Äôs parents where Casey can get to know her father‚Äôs parents and Feivel can go on walks with me while I pull him in his wagon when he gets too tired. I try not to think too much of what happened, but I still have trouble sleeping.

I was going through my usual morning routine - getting dressed, making coffee, responding to messages - when it suddenly hit me: I'm not really *present* for any of it. It's like I'm watching myself go through the motions from somewhere far away.

The weird part is, I'm functioning. I meet my responsibilities, I smile at the right times, I get things done. But inside, there's this constant feeling of disconnection. Like I'm a spectator in my own life rather than actually living it.

Sometimes I catch myself in the middle of a conversation and realize I've been responding automatically without really being there. Or I'll finish an entire workday and barely remember what happened.

I can't tell if this is my brain's way of protecting itself from stress, or if something's actually wrong. Has anyone else experienced this kind of detachment? How do you snap out of it and start feeling real again?

I want to feel more connected to my life, but I'm not even sure where to start. Would love to hear if others have dealt with this and what helped them.

What would you suggest for breaking out of this autopilot mode?",1,1740358333.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False

So much so I stop taking it with me when we meet up

A nice sunset makes me calm and relaxed so I take a picture of it anytime I get the chance 

I love sweet tea so much so I get everyday before school 

I love funny dog videos so much so I rewatch them as many times as I can 

Your my coffee, you make my heart race and my hands shake

I had to stop bringing it with me when we met up because it would become to much 

Your the sunset when it‚Äôs orange and red all I want to do is take a picture of you in that moment 

Your my sweet tea because when I wake up I send you a good morning text with a ton of exclamation points

I wait till you wake up for you to send a good morning text back trying to out do me in how many exclamation points you send back

Your like the funny dog videos I watch

I reread our text to make me laugh 

I love all of this about you plus so much more 

Like how you rant on about computer stuff

Or how you send me adorable pictures of your dog

Your so precious to me",3,1740358157.0,Poem,0,1.0,False
