I am starting to get the hang of it. My goal is to get ketones above 2.0 in the mornings. Also just wondering how long until I get the energy benefits from it? I am mostly bed ridden. I feel a definite switch in my brain. I feel much more even emotionally. I don't actually feel sad anymore, which is a huge positive. Usually my ketones in the morning are about 1.5-1.8. Throughout the day they are in 2.0- 2.1 

I have a hard time fasting bc I get migraines, and they are triggered by fasting. Also have many food intolerances. Also just can't motivate myself to get out of bed much. Which is what I am really wanting at this point. 

I have been able to eliminate 1 of my medications, and starting to taper off another medication.  That is a huge win for me. 

It is so odd but I feel in my brain when I get to 2.0 ketones or above. It is like I feel like my brain starts to breathe or gets some sort of energy .  I'm wondering if anyone else feels this?

So I am getting so tired of still being bed ridden, and wondering if this will one day help? I just want to lead a normal life...

  
Also any tips or tricks to get ketones higher, especially overnight to wake up in deeper ketosis?

  
Things I already do is use MCT oil, although not super consistent with it. Butter and cream I coffee. Keeping my protein down, about 50-60 grams, and net carbs under 20. 

  
Does anyone use exogenous ketones? Would that maybe help to get me higher ketones and possibly get me to start exercising?

Thanks for anyones advice or encouragement:)",1,1765030038.0,MedicalKeto,0,1.0,False

I was going through so much in 2025, I was not ready for a relationship but decided to go with it anyways, which now we both see it was a mistake. I was mentally unwell and I should know better that someone like this cannot take care of the other person properly. All in all, even though we were very stable now, he was still carrying all the heaviness of the past months, which he admitted he should've taken more care of it instead of simply ignoring it. And this has nothing to do with him not being able to look after me, he did, he cared, but other things happened too.

I was about to ask for a break the day before he asked for a break, we went nearly a week with no contact and met yesterday to have a final talk. And it was light, full of good memories and two people who actually understand that it was a very very bad timing, surprisingly he said ""i love you"" for the first time and we were already missing each other so damn much. He asked for a final kiss, we cried more, it is so hard leaving while you're still so in love and when you care so much, but we have to prioritize our mental health first. There's only so much someone can take it, you know?

We agreed on going for a coffee eventually, when things feel lighter, when he's better and I'm more stable. This was the second breakup of my life and I can't believe that it was such a raw, beautiful moment. Some of my friends think we will get back together eventually, but I'm not thinking about it at all...Today I am missing him everywhere, the messages, the little jokes, the small rituals, he is everywhere today and this will probably linger for some weeks...But we move on.",1,1765029731.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

A voiceover, deep and gravelly, echoed—not from the room, but from the architecture of reality itself. It sounded like a judge reading a death sentence.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
According to the immutable statutes of the Aeronautical Codex, subsection seven, paragraph three... there is no mathematical model, no physics engine, no god-fearing equation that grants the Apis Mellifera the right to achieve verticality.
Barry twitched. He picked up a comb, running it through hair that felt too stiff, too fuzzy.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
The wings are insufficient. The surface area is a mockery of drag coefficients. The body is rotund. A fat little vessel of arrogance. It should remain earthbound. It must remain earthbound.
Barry dropped the comb. It clattered loudly, echoing like a gunshot. He stared into his own eyes. They were compound. Fractured. A thousand versions of himself screaming back.
NARRATOR (V.O.)
But the bee... the bee does not acknowledge the laws of men or physics. The bee flies anyway. Because the bee possesses a nihilistic disregard for the impossible.
Barry stood before an expansive wardrobe filled with thousands of identical uniforms. He pulled one out, examining it with the scrutiny of a bomb disposal expert.
BARRY
(Muttering, feverish)
Yellow. Black. Yellow. Black. Yellow. Black. Yellow. Black.
He threw the suit aside. He grabbed another. Identical.
BARRY
Ooh. Black and yellow.
(A pause. A dangerous smile.)
Let's shake it up a little.
Suddenly, the floor vibrated. A siren wailed, disguised as a maternal voice.
MOTHER (O.S.)
(Distorted, booming)
BARRY! BREAKFAST IS READY!
Barry froze. The tension snapped. He yelled back, his voice cracking with the desperation of a soldier returning to the trenches.
BARRY
COMING!
Barry stood at the top of a spiral staircase that seemed to descend into an infinite void. He began to vibrate, hovering inches above the carpet, tempted by an impossible escape.
FATHER (O.S.)
(A harsh, authoritarian bark)
Stop flying in the house!
Barry dropped. Hard. He sighed, defeated by the domestic regime.
In the retro-futuristic nightmare of the kitchen, ADAM entered. He looked like Barry, but with the dead eyes of a middle-manager.
ADAM
Barry.
BARRY
Adam.
Adam reached out, touching the rigid, gelled carapace of Barry's head.
ADAM
Is that fuzz gel?
BARRY
A little. Special day. Graduation.
ADAM
Never thought I'd make it.
BARRY
Three days grade school. Three days high school.
Barry stared into his coffee. The liquid was thick, amber, viscous.
BARRY
Those were awkward.
ADAM
Three days college. I'm glad I took a day and hitchhiked around The Hive.
BARRY
You did come back different.
In a sprawling metropolis of hexagonal claustrophobia, they passed a neighbor, ARTIE.
BARRY
Hi, Barry. Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
ARTIE
(Haunted)
Hear about Frankie?
BARRY
Yeah.
ARTIE
You going to the funeral?
BARRY
No, I'm not going. Everybody knows, sting someone, you die.
The line hung in the air. The ultimate sanction.
BARRY
Don't waste it on a squirrel. Such a hothead.
At the graduation ceremony, a stadium filled with millions. A sea of black and yellow conformity. DEAN BUZZWELL stood at the podium, looking like a dictator in a polyester gown.
DEAN BUZZWELL
Welcome, New Hive City graduating class of... 9:15. That concludes our ceremonies. And begins your career at Honex Industries!
The crowd gasped. The illusion of choice was stripped away.
ADAM
Will we pick our job today?
BARRY
I heard it's just orientation.
They were plunged into darkness, riding a tram through a kaleidoscope of capitalist propaganda. Golden liquid flowed through massive pipes. The smell was intoxicatingly sweet.
GUIDE VOICE
Welcome to Honex, a division of Honesco and a part of the Hexagon Group. We know that you, as a bee, have worked your whole life to get to the point where you can work for your whole life.
Barry stared at the workers. Their eyes were vacant. They were happy. It was terrifying.
GUIDE VOICE
Honey begins when our valiant Pollen Jocks bring the nectar to The Hive. Our top-secret formula is automatically color-corrected, scent-adjusted and bubble-contoured into this soothing sweet syrup with its distinctive golden glow you know as... Honey!
A female worker walked by. She was beautiful. She was identical to everyone else.
BARRY
That girl was hot.
ADAM
She's my cousin!
BARRY
She is?
ADAM
Yes, we're all cousins.
BARRY
(A moment of existential horror)
Right. You're right.
They stood before a massive screen scrolling through job titles. Each one a life sentence.
GUIDE VOICE
Choose carefully. Because you'll stay in the job you pick for the rest of your life.
BARRY
The same job... the rest of your life? I didn't know that.
ADAM
What's the difference?
GUIDE VOICE
You'll be happy to know that bees, as a species, haven't had one day off in 27 million years.
BARRY
(Voice rising, panic setting in)
So you'll just work us to death?
GUIDE VOICE
We'll sure try.
BARRY
""What's the difference?"" How can you say that? One job forever? That's an insane choice to have to make.
ADAM
I'm relieved. Now we only have to make one decision in life.
BARRY
But, Adam, how could they never have told us that?
ADAM
Why would you question anything? We're bees. We're the most perfectly functioning society on Earth.
BARRY
You ever think maybe things work a little too well here?
ADAM
Like what? Give me one example.
BARRY
I don't know. But you know what I'm talking about.
Suddenly, the air pressure dropped. A siren blared. The ""Royal Nectar Force"" approached. These were soldiers. Massive, scarred, wearing sunglasses that reflected the void.
BARRY
Hey, those are Pollen Jocks! I've never seen them this close. They know what it's like outside The Hive.
ADAM
Yeah, but some don't come back.
One of the Jocks, JACKSON, spotted Barry and Adam gawking.
JACKSON
Couple of Hive Harrys. Let's have fun with them. Once a bear pinned me against a mushroom! He had a paw on my throat, and with the other, he was slapping me!
BARRY
It must be dangerous being a Pollen Jock.
JACKSON
We're hitting a sunflower patch six miles from here tomorrow. A puddle jump for us, but maybe you're not up for it.
BARRY
Six miles, huh? Maybe I am.
ADAM
You are not!
Jackson leaned in close.
JACKSON
We're going 0900 at J-Gate. What do you think, buzzy-boy? Are you bee enough?
BARRY
I might be. It all depends on what 0900 means.

1pfpt6h,https://www.reddit.com/r/BanGDream/comments/1pfpt6h/my_experience_buying_merchandise_on_venue_at_mygo/,My experience buying merchandise on venue at MyGO 8th Live,"Originally I planned on pre-ordering merchandise online and picking up at the venue (Keio Arena). But unfortunately life got busy (yay government shutdown) and I missed out on the pre-order period. Hopefully this post will help those who are going to a concert and want to buy merch at the venue. 

  
The live's website will have information about the merchandise available with pricing, as well as other areas. At this live there was a food/beverage and sponsorship area at this spot with vendors like ESP, Weiss Schwarz, New Japan Protein, Blu-Ray/CD sales, a collaboration with Ok Coffee, and some other Bushiroad sponsored areas. This area is completely separate from the main merchandise they were selling.

  
On the website, it said that they would hand out random number tickets at 10:30 AM. If you have a Bushiroad credit card you get first priority on buying merchandise. I got to Keio Arena at 10:00 AM and the line to wait was pretty long. Once it hit 10:30, they started handing out the tickets and it went by pretty fast. I was #652 and there was a QR code you could scan that would show your place in line. Bushi\_goods on Twitter was also posting the numbers being called. They would call in batches, such as numbers below 100, then numbers below 200, etc. It took about an hour for my number to be called. 

  
Once I got there, I showed them my ticket and the lines at the merchandise pos was pretty short and nothing was sold out yet. I got my goods within five minutes. 

I did go to the food/beverage and sponsorship area afterwards, but it was very crowded so I only waited in line at the Ok Coffee area. The person before me bought the last mug (unlucky) but I was still able to get a coaster. It looked like their tap to pay device was broken, so they only took cash or QR code payment there. 

On a side note, they never checked for my ePlus ticket this whole process, so I guess if you don't have a ticket but are in the area, you could line up to buy merch if you really wanted to.

Before the live started in the arena, there was staff walking around still offering merch for sale, it was just a couple goods though.

  
So yeah that's pretty much it, I did have to go to the venue early to get a numbered ticket, but overall the main merchandise area and the food/beverage sponsorship area probably took me 2 - 2.5 hours. You could definitely spend more time at the food/beverage sponsorship area than I did.",4,1765029135.0,BanGDream,0,1.0,False

1pfpo96,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1pfpo96/afterlife_death/,Afterlife Death,"“This can’t be right,” I said, my eyes glued to my iMac, my coffee-lifting arm frozen midair. I was in the study, wherein I’d spent the better part of a month scrutinizing job listings, afore a desktop buried under bite-sized candy bar wrappers.

 

“What can’t be right?” asked my wife, Beatrice, from just over my shoulder. Since my layoff, her pretty face had sprouted three new wrinkles—deep ones—and her incessant nagging was the only thing keeping me from the couch, from watching ESPN until my eyes bled. Her job as a telecom sales rep barely covered her wardrobe requirements, after all, and our savings would only stretch so far before we lost the house. 

 

“This listing. No way can it be legitimate.”

 

“What’s it say?”

 

I swiveled in my seat, to stare into those chestnut-colored eyes of hers. It seemed that she’d been crying. Anxiously, she finger-scrunched her black bob cut. 

 

“It says that the research and development division of some company—Investutech, I guess it’s called—will pay $10,000 to anyone who lets the company claim their body after death.”

 

“So they pay you now, even though it might take you decades to die?”

 

“It appears so.”

 

Softly laughing, she shook her skeptical head. “Yeah, that’s *gotta be* a scam. But then again, it can’t hurt to call the number.”

 

“You’re serious? You want me to call these guys?” 

 

Before I could blink, Beatrice had the phone in my hand.  

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Investutech’s R&D facility epitomized modern architecture: a massive cube of steel and glass, unadorned and soulless. In its lobby, I met Dr. Vern Landon, Lab Supervisor. A short, bald fellow disappearing into his own liver spots, the good doctor shook my hand as if attempting to crush a spider between our palms.

 

“Thanks for coming down,” he said. “I know we’re somewhat off the beaten path, but that’s how corporate prefers it.”

 

“It’s no problem.”

 

“You’re here about the Internet listing, I understand.”

 

“Yeah…it’s some kind of scam, right?”

 

“Quite the opposite, my friend. At this establishment, we seek nothing less than world-shattering scientific innovation. In this pursuit, we use every tool obtainable, even the dead ones. To those of a scientific bent, a fresh corpse offers a cornucopia of potential knowledge.”

 

“Huh?”

 

“Some experiments are too risky to use a living human as a test subject, and lab monkeys don’t always cut the mustard. Perhaps you’d like an example. Well, when developing a medical device, we can insert it into a deceased man or woman to ensure that everything fits where it’s supposed to. We also harvest organs for tissue engineering projects.”

 

“Tissue engineering?”

 

“Yeah, buddy. Right now, we’re learning to create artificial and bioartificial organs for patients awaiting transplants. We also use cadavers in all sorts of genetic engineering projects.”  

 

Gently gripping my arm, Dr. Landon herded me down the corridor. “Come along now,” he said. “I’ll give you the grand tour.”

 

We passed a cafeteria, wherein a handful of sad-faced individuals in lab coats sat at Formica tables, silently consuming their lunches. As we walked, my guide began orating:

 

“Investutech is the number one innovator in a wide range of fields—from mainstream consumer technology to the wildest of fringe sciences. In fact, there are facilities like this spread all across the United States, answerable only to Investutech’s board of directors. At this location alone, we have laboratories dedicated not only to biomedical engineering, but also to physics, biology, and even psychology. We are engaged in many exciting projects here, which I’m unfortunately unable to speak of. Here’s the elevator. Why don’t we hop aboard?”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

While I didn’t get the whole run of the facility, I saw enough to be suitably impressed. Many doors were closed to us, requiring security clearance denied to visitors. I did, however, get to see a particle accelerator, located in an extensive, circular tunnel beneath the facility. The device’s beam pipe resembled something from a sci-fi flick, as if light cycle races could take place inside it. Naturally, I requested to see the thing in action—propelling particles at nearly the speed of light—but the doctor assured me it wasn’t possible.

 

The labs I visited were practically identical: workbenches and cabinets, sinks and tables, notebooks filled with incomprehensible jottings. In some corners, I saw containers marked with radioactive waste tags. 

 

In one laboratory, I was introduced to the jubilant Dr. Hegseth. Rotund and mottled, the man handed me a pill bottle labeled *6/7.9*. 

 

“What’s this?” I asked.

 

“Have you ever gone to the movies after getting good and smashed at the nearest bar?” 

 

“Why, yes, I suppose I have.”

 

“It’s great, isn’t it? In fact, the practice has gotten me through many an evening with the missus. The only drawback is the inevitable bathroom break, during which you could be missing the movie’s best scenes.”

 

“Yeah…what’s your point?”

 

“Well, each of those pills affects your system like a six-pack of strong beer. You can get as drunk as you like and never have to pee once. Pop a pill or two and you’re ready to sit through even the most insipid romantic comedy. Best of all, you won’t be burning off your date’s eyelashes with a blast of dragon breath.”

 

Thinking it over, I had to admit that the innovation intrigued me. 

 

“Keep the bottle,” Dr. Hegseth said. “They hit the market next month.”

 

Dr. Landon led me further down the corridor. Passing a number of simulation-running supercomputers, we arrived at the psychologists’ labs: austere rooms featuring one-way mirrors and hidden cameras, allowing one to observe the behavior of human test subjects. Only one room was occupied. Imagine my surprise when Dr. Landon whipped out his security card and ushered me inside it.

 

In one corner of the room, sitting with his knees pressing his chest, was a bearded man in a hockey jersey and soiled blue jeans. He stared without seeing, rarely blinking, spittle spilling from his mouth corners. *Does he even register my presence?* I wondered. For a moment, his face seemed to contort into a terror mask…but then his mouth slackened again, and I had to wonder if I’d imagined the expression change. 

 

“This is Ruben,” my guide informed me. “He’s the last of our Nonlinears.”

 

“Nonlinears?” I asked.

 

“How can I explain this to you? Basically, our brains are filled with these cells called neurons—around 100 billion of them, supposedly—which process and transmit information all day long. Each neuron is electrochemically linked to at least 20,000 other neurons, sending and receiving signals through synapse connections. If not for them, our minds wouldn’t function properly.

 

“With the Nonlinears, we did a little brain tinkering, blasting their temporal lobes with intense dopamine bombardments to unlink the neurons associated with linear time perception. We weren’t sure what would happen, but the results defied all hypotheses.”

 

“What happened?” I asked, astounded.

 

“We discovered that by unlinking these selected neurons, we altered their time perception beyond anything we could’ve imagined. In fact, the tragic bastards ended up living every moment of their lives from that point onward simultaneously, all the way up to their deaths.”

 

“That’s amazing.”

 

“You’d think so, but experiencing a lifetime of sensations all at once is too much for *anyone* to process. That’s why Ruben doesn’t move. We feed him and clean him because he’s trying to do as little as possible, to limit his movement and sensations to a manageable level. He’ll likely remain that way until he expires, the poor guy.”

 

“So, what happened to the rest of the Nonlinears?”

 

“Some had immediate heart attacks, the sensation onslaught being too intense for their autonomic nervous systems. Some succumbed to brain aneurisms. The rest committed suicide in the most gruesome way imaginable, bashing their heads against the walls until their skulls caved in.”

 

“Good lord.”

 

“Only Ruben had the foresight to claim a corner for his own. Who knows what’s happening in that manic brain of his? Every communication attempt has been a failure thus far, just like the experiment itself.” 

 

The doctor ushered me out. “Well, that about concludes the tour. I could show you the bacteriology and virology labs, but you’d have to put on a biocontaminant suit before entering, and then take a chemical shower, followed by a regular shower, before leaving. It’s not worth the effort, trust me.”

 

“No problem. My mind’s blown already.”  

 

“Of course it is,” he chuckled. “So…have you made a decision? You’ve seen what we do here. Will you sell us your corpse?”

 

“For ten grand, it’s a no brainer,” I replied.

 

“Great! Step into my office and we’ll fill out all of the necessary paperwork. We’ll cut you a check and let you get back to your life.”

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Two weeks later, my wife and I were eating portabello tatin at a quaint French bistro. Sucking down Pierre Ponnelle Pinot Noir by the glassful, we contemplated a getaway cruise to the Bahamas. 

 

The check had cleared, and life was grand. No longer did we argue about money; no longer did I power through bags of miniature candy bars at my desk, searching in vain for a job that never existed. The ten grand would run out eventually, but until then I wasn’t going to let life get me down.

 

My wife made a joke. Laughing uproariously, I accidentally knocked over my wine. Dabbing it up with a napkin, I regretted popping a *6/7.9* pill before dinner, which had left me buzzed immaculate, just a stone’s throw away from drunk. I didn’t want to embarrass Beatrice, not when things were going so well. 

 

Neither of us desired dessert, so with our plates mostly emptied, I signaled for the check. Tipping the waiter a magnanimous twenty-five percent, I took my wife by the elbow and escorted her from the restaurant, into the sun-drenched day. There was a park across the street, a grass field framed with benches, containing no less than twelve picnic tables. To prolong our love’s rekindling, I suggested that we grab a bench, to watch a Hispanic family play croquet. 

 

“That sounds nice, dear,” Beatrice cooed, giving my hand a tender squeeze. I felt a decade younger, like it was our first date all over again, and it was going better than I’d hoped for. When the little green man appeared at the other end of the crosswalk, we strode forward leisurely, eyeing each other, not the surrounding traffic. 

 

Just as we passed the median strip, tragedy struck. At the sound of a horn blare, I glanced up to see a green Chevy Nova flying down the left-hand turn lane. Perhaps its bug-eyed driver hadn’t noticed the red light, or perhaps he didn’t care. Either way, I had just enough time to push my wife behind me, just enough time to brace for impact. With a great crumpling, I found myself ground under the vehicle’s polished metal grille.

 

I felt my bones grind and splinter, my liver burst. Drowning on lifeblood, I watched the world cloud over. Dying, I tried to speak Beatrice’s name, succeeding only in vomiting blood and bile onto the asphalt. 

 

Then I was gone, breeze-borne into oblivion. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When next my eyes opened, I beheld neither Heaven nor Hell—no harp-strumming angels, no demons cavorting around a lake of fire. Instead, I found myself strapped to a metal table in one of Investutech’s psychology labs, with a shorthaired Asian American doctor attempting to blind me with a penlight. 

 

“He’s awake, Dr. Landon,” the man announced.

 

In the background stood my erstwhile tour guide—smiling benevolently, sweat beads dotting his brow. “Welcome back, my friend,” he said. “I trust that you remember me.”

 

“Whaaa…haaapened?” I wheezed, my voice like a broken lawnmower. My skin was cold. I felt metal rods inside of me, where my bones had been. My outfit consisted of a hospital gown over thick layers of bandages. Even without drugs, there was no discomfort. It was like all of my pain receptors had been switched off. 

 

“There’s no other way to tell you but to leap right in,” said Landon, struggling for a soothing tone. “You were run over by a car in the middle of an intersection. You pushed your wife to safety, but lost your life in the process. In fact, your funeral started five minutes ago. They’re burying an empty coffin, however, as you signed your body over to us.”

 

“Youuu…brought meee baack.”

 

“We sure did. In fact, you’ve become the culmination of all our work at this facility. Most of your organs were ruined, so our tissue engineering division grew you new ones. A good portion of your skeleton was shattered, so we grafted steel bones into your physique. After that, with a strenuous application of galvanism, we actually brought the life spark back to your body. Your heart’s beating, and your neurons fire again. Now, if we can just figure out a way to stop the decay process, you’ll be good as new. You may even return to your wife someday.”

 

“Ah’m decaaaying?”

 

“Unfortunately, yes. It seems that your body doesn’t realize that it’s alive again. But our biomedical engineers are on the case, positing thermoregulation strategies even now. They should have your body generating heat again in no time.” 

 

“Whaaas wrong wiith my voiiiice?”

 

“Well, my friend, you did crack your head pretty hard on that crosswalk. Obviously, the trauma affected your brain’s language center. Once we stop the decay, perhaps we’ll look into repairing it.”

 

“Whyee am I straaapped doown?”

 

“Oh, that’s just a precaution. We’ve never tried something like this before, and had no idea what you’d be like upon waking. Dr. Lee, free our guest from his bonds, will you?”

 

The doctor did as instructed, allowing me to test my reflexes. They seemed unnaturally slow, as if the connection between my mind and musculature was on a time delay. After what felt like an hour, I *finally* slid my legs over the table and lurched to standing.

 

“Steady, steady,” Dr. Lee cautioned. “We don’t want you toppling over.”

 

Attempting to walk, I found my legs insensible. Indeed, I toppled forward. Fortunately, Dr. Lee was kind enough to catch me. 

 

“I warned you about that,” he grumbled, straining to brace me up. “Next time, we’ll…arggh!”

 

His screams were deafening. Groggily, I realized the source of his discomfort. For some reason, my body—operating on pure instinct—had me biting deep into Lee’s neck, gnawing frantically, my mouth filling with arterial blood. I was repulsed, yet couldn’t stop myself. A powerful appetite suffused me; it seemed it would never abate. 

 

Eventually, Lee’s screams faded. Landon tugged the corpse from my grip and I lurched in pursuit, tripping into a face plant. Losing consciousness, I heard the door slam behind them, locking me in my cell. 

 

\*          \*          \*

 

For a while, I lurked in solitude, though I sensed observers just beyond the one-way glass. Time lost all meaning, as I no longer required sleep. Though I drank nothing, I felt no thirst, only that damnable hunger, that yearning for human flesh.   

 

With no entertainment options, I spent my time relearning to walk. It was more of a shamble, actually, as my knees refused to bend. Afterwards, I watched my body putrefy. 

 

First, my lower abdomen turned green. Then, in an embarrassing display, every bodily fluid, every bit of fecal matter, poured out of me. My face swelled balloonlike: mouth, lips, and tongue practically bursting. The swelling made even slurred speech impossible, garbling my every vocalization into soft moaning. 

 

My veins sprouted red tendrils, which later went green. Blisters erupted everywhere, suppurating pale, yellow fluid. Even my skin and hair began sloughing away. I won’t even mention the smell.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

When Dr. Landon finally reappeared, this time flanked by two armed guards, I was in full-on undead mode. Landon offered no reaction to my appearance, but his eyes were sad. Gone was the jovial tour guide I remembered, replaced by a man who looked two decades older. Nauseous, the guards squinted at me, Glock 22s at the ready.

 

“Guuuuuhhhh,” I said, the best salutation I could manage under the circumstances. 

 

“Guh right back,” replied Landon. He hesitated for a moment, his face slackening sorrowfully. Regaining his composure, he said, “Well…I have some bad news, buddy. Because you slaughtered Dr. Lee, no scientist will go near you. This means that all efforts to stop, and even reverse, your decay have been suspended. In fact, Investutech’s board of directors has proposed returning you to the grave, allowing us to study your brain postmortem. Hopefully, we’ll be able to identify what prompted your blood lust and correct it before our next test subject arrives.”

 

“Nnnnnn.”

 

“I’m sorry, but that’s the situation. The final decision has yet to arrive, but I wouldn’t get your hopes up. The next time we enter your cell, it’ll most likely be to put you down. If it’s any consolation, though, your wife knows nothing of this. To her, you’ve been dead all this time. If Beatrice saw you now, who knows what it would do to her?”

 

The doctor’s practiced indifference disintegrated, as hoarse sobs burst through his quivering lips. Spilling tears, he exited the room, with both escorts trailing behind him. “I’m so sorry!” Landon called back, just before the door closed.

 

Starving and depressed, I threw myself from wall to wall. *I should’ve eaten all three of them when I had the chance*, I reasoned. *I’m already deadish. What could their guns possibly do to me?* Beneath the stained, tattered mess of my hospital gown, most of my bandages had peeled away. With every wall collision, my putrid body discharged flesh chunks, which only increased my agitation. Eventually, I collapsed, howling at the top of what was left of my lungs.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Time crawled interminably. My body dried out—darkening, acquiring a texture like cottage cheese—as its terrible death stench subsided. Internally, I visualized maggots wriggling throughout my organs, feasting on necrotic tissue. 

 

My shambling slowed, every step now a struggle. I have no idea what kept me ambulatory, kept my tormented spirit inside its moldering frame. Perhaps dark sorcery was involved.

 

Finally, Dr. Landon reappeared, accompanied by four guards this time, all with weapons drawn. “Well, my boy, the end has come,” he informed me. “I’d have brought a priest to pray over your immortal soul, but lab security doesn’t permit faith-mongers. Once again, I’d like to apologize for your situation. Sometimes good intentions breed monsters; sometimes all you can do is cut your losses and try to learn from your mistakes. Goodbye, my friend.”

 

The guards opened fire, sending a bullet spray through my torso, legs and arms. Feeling no pain, I stepped forward to meet them, as fragments of my living corpse splattered the floor behind me.

 

“It’s not working!” shouted one guard—a mulleted, red-faced ginger—right before I tore his head off. 

 

“Mmmmmwwwwah,” I moaned, reveling in the blood spray, wondering where my prodigious strength came from. It almost equaled my hunger. 

 

The next guard, I ripped his gun away, along with the arm holding it. In shock, his eyes rolling back into his skull, the brawny fellow dropped to his knees. 

 

I cracked the third guard’s cranium clean open. Consuming warm blood and squishy clumps of cerebral cortex, I would’ve slobbered, had my salivary glands still been operational. 

 

Dr. Landon, grasping the situation’s severity, turned on his heels and sprinted out of the room, hooking a right down the corridor. Naturally, I gave pursuit, pausing only to disembowel the fourth guard. 

 

Bloodlust lent new strength to my shamble. Resembling a mentally disabled child skipping, I positively flew down the hall. Catching up to Landon, I found him collapsed, hand to chest, gasping with an ashen face. Before the heart attack could claim him, I dashed his brains onto the floor and began to feed. 

 

With the doctor’s corpse picked clean, I grabbed his security clearance card and went back for the guards. Not that I was still hungry, mind you, but when visiting a buffet, you expect to gorge yourself.

 

\*          \*          \*

 

Sirens blared overhead. Startled, I paused, clenching a dripping tendon between my teeth. They’d be coming for me, I realized, most likely in numbers I couldn’t fight through. Still, I had Landon’s key card and a memory of a fellow detainee: Ruben, the Nonlinear.

 

Two doors down the hall, I buzzed myself in. Ruben raised his eyes as I entered. I knew that this time he was really seeing me.

 

“You’re finally here,” he said, unafraid. 

 

“Ynnnnnn,” I confirmed, closing the intervening distance. 

 

My chin slick with the blood of my captors, I leaned over the Nonlinear. As my teeth met his flesh, he had just enough time to thank me. Then came gunfire and bloodletting, great gore eruptions amid a soundtrack of shrieking. The world began dimming; a red curtain closed.",1,1765028751.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

I recently had bitewing X-rays taken because a dentist said I have “multiple small cavities” on my molars and recommended fillings. Visually I mainly see dark staining in the fissures and I sometimes get mild dull pain that comes and goes, but nothing severe. I have wisdom teeth that have to be removed.

I’m hesitant to drill without being sure these represent true dentin caries rather than enamel staining or early non-cavitated lesions.

Photos of my bitewings attached.

My questions:

Do the radiolucencies seen here look like true cavities extending into dentin, or could some be sound enamel / staining?

Which teeth, if any, clearly need restoration based on these X-rays alone?

Are any lesions early enough to be monitored or treated with remineralization instead of drilling?

Is restorative treatment justified right now?

I know this isn’t a new topic, but I’d really like to hear different perspectives -from all sides.

I’m a gay man who naturally leans more feminine and androgynous in appearance. I’m just a guy who grew up in an all-female environment and never had male friends, so I’ve always been soft-spoken and neutral in my mannerisms.

What I struggle with is how I’m treated within the community. On dating apps and in real life, I feel like I’m either completely disregarded by other gay men or purely sexualised. I hardly ever get messages from gay men who seem genuinely interested. Most of the guys who do reach out are curious or bi men looking for a very specific fantasy for the night. It rarely feels like people take me seriously.

My friends and acquaintances go on dates all the time-actual dates, like drinks or coffee. I can honestly say that barely ever happens for me. Even on “normal” apps like Hinge or Bumble, people still seem only interested in meeting me sexually. I don’t present myself in a sexual way and my conversations are never suggestive, yet that’s the energy I receive back.

Sometimes it honestly makes me want to change my appearance or presentation-cut my hair short, try to be more masculine, change the way I talk -just to be seen as dateable rather than a niche or a fetish. I know changing myself for others isn’t healthy, but it’s hard not to feel like nobody will ever want something serious with me simply because I look feminine.

I’m part of some LGBT social groups and most of the gay men there fit the same masculine aesthetic -beards, muscles, very “90s porn star” energy. No shade, they all look great, but it’s just not me. And it’s not uncommon for them to joke at my expense: calling me a “femboy,” saying I’m “not really a man,” or assuming I’m non-binary. I’m constantly told, “You’re pretty, but not my type,” and I’m confused about how quickly people make these judgements.

I guess I just want to know:
Is this a common experience for feminine gay men? Do other people feel like they’re either sexualised or invisible?

1pfpexj,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1pfpexj/underwhelming_brewwhat_would_you_change/,Underwhelming brew…what would you change?,"This was the first coffee I’ve had for my advent calendar that I wasn’t super happy with. The brew came out a little watery, thin, and just kind of “roasty” without strong presence of notes they mention, or any other notes. I have some ideas what to try for the next brew but was also wondering what any of you thought…

Coffee info and process I followed is pasted below (you can guess by the info this is a darker roast). 

COFFEE INFO/METHOD

Nicaragua Las Segovias by Bean North Coffee Roasters
Cocoa
Vanilla
Tobacco
ORIGIN Nicaragua
REGION Jícaro, Murra, Ciudad Antigua, San Fernando and Jalapa
PRODUCER PROCOCER
PROCESS Washed
ELEVATION 850-1400 masl
VARIETAL Caturra, Bourbon, Lempira, Catimor

Brewing tips from the roaster:

DOSE
20g coffee to 300g water
GRIND SIZE
Medium-fine, ~750–850 microns, comparable to table salt
WATER, TEMPERATURE
75-125ppm (low bicarbonates), 94°C
BREWING METHOD
Hario V60, V60 paper filter
Rinse filter thoroughly to eliminate paper taste and preheat vessel. Add 20g of ground coffee, level the bed. Start with a 50g bloom pour, swirl gently to saturate. At 0m30s, begin a steady spiral pour up to 150g. At 1m15s, continue pouring to 250g, maintaining even flow. At 2m00s, finish the final pour to 300g. Allow drawdown to complete by 3m00s–3m15s.



I followed the above as closely as I could (main exception was water). Things I could change:

1) Grinder: I used a zp6 at 5.3, I could either adjust the grind size or use my timemore C3s.
2) Water temp
3) Brewer: I used my size 03 switch fully open but I could do immersion, or hybrid 
4) Dose: I have 30g left, I am thinking of doing two more 15g brews for further testing but could also do one larger 30g brew.
5) Ratio: I did 1:15 as it says to

Things I can’t/wont change:
1) Water itself: I’m using water I get from a local filling station outside a supermarket that does a 12 step R/O purification process and I’ve always used for coffees with good success. it’s what I have other than nasty tap
2) Filters: hario filters, they’re what I have 
3) Brewer: I only have a switch or plastic v60. I don’t have any flat bottoms, no melodrip, no non-bypass, etc.

I know this is a bit of a jumbled mess it's hard tryna rack all this from my brain into a readable sentence

and yeah I know im doomed working a 30k a year blue collar job with how fucked my school stuff is that's not really my concern as much as not having a friggen social life is fyi 🥹

Graham pulled at the wavy chestnut curls atop his head. His hickory-brown eyes scanned the morning files. The McDonald’s medium coffee—no sugar, two creams—gave his fingers something to play the drums on. He’d hung his charcoal-gray suit jacket behind his office door with great care. The crisp white Brooks Brothers collared shirt and burgundy silk tie perfectly suited his olive complexion, and the cufflinks sparkled under the fluorescent lights.

She used my usual butter cake recipe and added cocoa powder + coffee to  half the batter make a chocolate cake. She added non fat instead of full cream milk since that was the only one we had. 

The butter cake half turned up good but the chocolate cake half is very off. There's a thick crust top and bottom. The crust is very chewy and the middle part is kinda liked whipped eggs. She added non fat milk only to the chocolate batter. 


Butter cake recipe

2 cups of flour

4 eggs

250g butter

1 1/2 cup sugar

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",2,1765027667.0,PokemonBlackandWhite,1,1.0,False

For seven days, I changed one simple thing: **how I drink my morning coffee**.

Not my workouts. Not my calories. Not my meals.

Just the *timing*, *quality*, and *recipe* of my coffee.

By day four, my fasting glucose dropped, my cravings vanished, and my belly looked flatter. And the more I dug into the research... cortisol, insulin, chlorogenic acid, the more it all made sense.

That’s why I recorded this episode for you.  
  
Because most people drink coffee in a way that **spikes insulin, raises stress hormones, and stalls fat loss**… and they have no idea.

But a few simple shifts can turn coffee into a fat-burning, metabolism-supporting tool.

I was a software engineer, headphones on, ticket in the queue, just churning out code. My main concerns were clean commits and whether the build would pass. But I had this nagging, annoying voice in my head that wouldn't shut up. With every new feature request, it would whisper, 'But… why? Who is actually going to use this?'

I became 'that guy' in sprint planning. The one who kept poking holes in the logic, not the code logic, but the *human* logic. Our PM at the time, bless her heart, was drowning in work. One day, after I questioned the existence of yet another button, she just said, 'You have so many questions, why don't you sit in on some customer calls with me?' She probably just wanted to shut me up, but it completely backfired on her.

That first call was a revelation. I wasn't just hearing a bug report; I was hearing a real person's frustration. I could almost picture their office, the coffee stain on their desk, the exasperated sigh as they tried to make our software do the one thing they needed it to do. Suddenly, it wasn't a ticket anymore; it was a problem to be solved for a human being. I started writing down ideas, sketching out flows, and I felt a creative spark I hadn't felt since my first 'Hello, World!' program.

Soon, I was unofficially doing half the PM's job – writing specs, talking to users, and arguing with my fellow engineers about *why* we were building things. When a dedicated PM role finally opened up on the team, my boss pulled me aside and told me it was a long shot, but I should apply. It was terrifying, but it felt right. Making that switch from code to PowerPoints and roadmaps was the single best accident of my professional life. I didn't leave engineering because I hated it; I left because I discovered I loved solving the puzzle of the user even more than the puzzle of the code.

So, what about you all? For those who switched into product from another field, what was your 'lightbulb' moment that made you take the leap?",1,1765027600.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Gather around because I, Mysterious Muslim, a humble traveller in the dunya, have returned with a true story from the trenches of campus life, a tale so tragic, so comedic, so spiritually confusing… that even Abu Hurairah (R.A) would’ve said, “akhi, repeat that again.”

It was a bright, peaceful morning on campus. Birds were chirping. Students were stressing. And somewhere in the distance, an uncle was arguing with his wife about the price of tomatoes.

I was minding my business as usual, walking like a side character, gaze lowered 45 degrees like the sunnah of avoiding eye contact with the dunya.

Then suddenly…I heard it. A voice. Soft. Desperate. Slightly shaky.

Sister… can I just say… your handwriting is really beautiful, mashaAllah.

I froze. Wallahi, my heart whispered, Inna lillahi wa inna ilayhi raji’un.

This brother, let’s call him Abdul Weakness, was standing there, smiling like he just completed Hajj by complimenting this sister’s notes.

Not her smile. Not her hijab. Not her character. Her handwriting. Because his handwriting needs Allah’s mercy.

Even the angels were like, bro… at least pick something believable.

The sister looked at him the way Aisha (R.A) probably looked at anyone who disturbed the Prophet’s (SAW) nap with silent mercy and mild regret.

She said, “uhh… thanks,” and went back to her work.

But Abdul Weakness did NOT retreat. No, no. This man was committed to the Battle of Badr in his heart.

I walked by slowly, pretending not to eavesdrop while absolutely eavesdropping.

Abdul Weakness continued:

“Do you, uh, maybe… want help carrying your laptop?” (My brother… laptops weigh like 2 kgs, relax.)

“Do you need notes from last class? I can send you mine.” ( even he skipped the last class 😂 )

“I can walk you to the library.” ( It was literally behind her )

At this point, even my soul wanted to give him a side hug and whisper, “Akhi, fear Allah and your dignity.” but i silently was seeing what's going to happen. 

I swear if Umar ibn Al-Khattab (R.A) was there, the ground would've been shaking from his footsteps alone.

Suddenly, the sister gently smiled and said: Oh! No need. My fiancé is picking me up.

Wallahi. The way Abdul Weakness’s soul LEFT his body.

I swear, I saw the light in his eyes do tawaf around his skull and disappear.

He said, Oh… mashaAllah… may Allah bless
and then quietly folded into himself like a samosa after frying.

His hands were in his pockets. His posture submitted. His nafs whispered, bro… you had NO chance. Get a life. 

Even I felt the sting, secondhand heartbreak is real.

I went to the cafeteria afterward to make dua for his recovery. An uncle saw me and said: what are you thinking ? I said, I witnessed the fall of a simp today.

The uncle sipped his chai, nodded deeply, and said: Aah yes… this generation drinks too much cold coffee. That’s the problem.

I didn’t argue. Uncles are allowed to be wrong confidently.

Brothers…. Lower your gaze. Preserve your honor. And stop simping over handwriting.

If you want barakah in your rizq, your heart, and your future nikah, focus on Fajr before you focus on her notes.

And if you must admire something, admire the akhlaq…from a safe halal distance.

May Allah ﷻ guide all simps to become kings, and protect us all from the fitnah of unnecessary friendliness.

If this story made you smile, may Allah ﷻ fill your day with barakah. If it made you cry, well… maybe that was a sign.

Hope you are making the best out of this beautiful S(C)aturday already! 

Before I even start ranting lol, if you have any cute photos of your pets; cats or puppies then please stop right here and slide in my dm with those cute pics haha, **please**! 

Anyhow, I was hoping for an encounter with a happy ending for a change! In essence, a conversation that can actually last a few hours, possibly a day or more and even higher odds: make me a new bestie! 😆 

A bit about me; super humble, kind, down to earn, love to travel, good books/reads, gym when I can, hiking & swimming any day of the year, literally haha. I also love trying new food/cuisines. Last but never least, I love me a delicious cup of freshly made Italian coffee or espresso! Oh! In fact, I need some now lol. 

I don’t have lots of expectations, aside from hoping to strike gold; meaning connect with someone interesting, a bit crazy too (the good crazy), not too overly dramatic, maybe a bit needy, a bit romantic, with a good sense of humor… some charm wouldn’t hurt a bit! I mean, I’m def all in to get to know you as long as you make a little effort in your first message and don’t ask me to sign up for your **only fa*ns, ins*ta, or none of that crazy stuff** haha.

It's way too common. You see them on the train, in a bookstore, at a coffee shop. You want to say something cool. Instead, you overthink, spiral, and do… nothing. Look, social anxiety is real. Awkwardness is real. But so much advice out there is just garbage. TikTok is full of bad “pickup artist” hacks and weird manipulation tactics that make you feel slimy or fake.

This post is researched from podcasts, psych studies, and real-life tested insights. If you want a no-BS cheat sheet for how to start a conversation with a girl (or anyone) using a cold approach and this is it. Let’s get into it.

1. Don't over-optimize the opener

The biggest mistake? Thinking the first sentence has to be brilliant. It doesn’t. In fact, research from Dr. Albert Mehrabian suggests that communication is only 7% verbal and the rest is tone and body language. So focus less on crafting a genius line and more on showing non-verbal confidence: walk up calmly, smile, don’t fidget, and make real eye contact.

2. Use “observational openers” instead of canned lines

This works 10x better than any pre-made script. Comment on something around you. Why? Because it's natural, and it shows awareness. A 2022 study in the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships found that situational conversation starters led to 34% higher response rates than generic lines like “Hey, what’s up?”

Examples that feel effortless:

- “That looks really good, what did you order?”
- “I’ve been staring at that book title for 10 minutes trying to decide if I should read it. Do you have any thoughts?”
- “I’m not gonna lie, your style is insanely cool. Where’d you get that bag?”

3. Go in with “zero outcome” thinking

This one changes the game. Don’t go in thinking “I need her number” or “I have to impress her.” Go in thinking, “I want to make her day a little more interesting.” That shift kills performance pressure and makes you way more relaxed. Renowned dating coach Mark Manson (author of The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck) swears by this mindset.

4. Use warmth over wit

It can misfire. Warmth doesn’t. Multiple behavioral studies like those from Harvard psychologist Amy Cuddy show that people judge trustworthiness faster than competence. So skip the clever puns and just be warm and present. A simple “Hey, I saw you and just wanted to say hi and how’s your day been?” is 1000x better than a rehearsed line.

5. Be time-sensitive and respectful

One of the best ways to avoid creepiness is to signal early that you’re not trying to dominate their time. Something like, “Hey, I know this is random and I won’t take much of your time, but...” Then hit them with your opener. It shows social intelligence.

6. Know how to soft-exit if the vibe is off

Not every conversation will click. That’s fine. The key is to exit gracefully. Say something like, “Anyway, I’ll let you get back to what you were doing, nice chatting with you.” No need to linger. That vibe is powerful.

7. Stack your “social proof reps” daily

Social fluency’s a muscle. You want to be smoother with cold approaches? Practice talking to strangers in normal ways. Compliment cashiers. Make small jokes in elevators. Get used to being social. In Tools of Titans, Tim Ferriss calls this “practicing fear exposure.” It makes real approaches feel way less intimidating.

8. Listen more than you talk

One of the quickest ways to sabotage a good start is to start talking AT someone, not with them. A 2016 MIT study found that successful dating conversations have a 50/50 exchange ratio. So ask questions. Show curiosity. Don’t monologue.

Now here’s the plug-and-play stuff that helped me build real social fluency:

1. Podcast recommendation: The Art of Charm

This is one of the best podcasts for social skills. Hosted by AJ Harbinger and Johnny Dzubak, it dives into everything from charisma to confidence to body language. Top-tier guests include FBI behavior experts, psychologists and elite coaches.

2. Book: Models by Mark Manson

This is the best book on attraction I’ve ever read. No manipulation, no fake tricks. Just a brutally honest guide to becoming more attractive by being emotionally honest, improving yourself, and showing vulnerability. This book will make you question everything you think you know about what makes people like you. Insanely good read.

3. App: Daylio Journal

If you want to get better at social calibration, you need reflection. Daylio is a micro-journaling app that lets you log your mood and social interactions fast. Track how your conversations felt. Notice patterns. It’s data-driven self-awareness.

4. App: BeFreed

An AI-powered learning app built by former Google engineers and Columbia alumni, BeFreed turns deep knowledge sources like expert interviews, psychology books, and research papers into personalized podcast-style lessons tailored to your goals.

I’ve been using it to sharpen my social confidence and communication skills. I just type in things like “how to be more charismatic” or “how to handle awkward silences,” and it generates audio lessons with real-world examples and strategies. You can even choose the voice and how deep you want to go, 10-minute overview or 40-minute deep dive. 

It’s helped me replace social media scroll time with actual growth. Highly recommend if you're serious about leveling up socially.

5. App: Prompted

This app gives daily self-reflection and conversation prompts. Practicing these helps you get better at storytelling and small talk. Feels like having a creativity gym in your pocket. Great for sparking ideas when your mental social battery is low.

6. YouTube: Charisma on Command

Probably the most binge-watchable channel for improving how you speak, behave, and carry yourself. Breaks down real celebrity interactions like “Why This Introvert Owns Every Room” and gives actionable psychological hacks that aren’t cringe.

7. Book: Captivate by Vanessa Van Edwards

Bestseller with insane insights on how first impressions, body language, and micro-expressions influence how people see you. Vanessa runs the Science of People Lab and every chapter is backed by studies. This book made me rethink how I show up socially. Best book if you feel awkward in one-on-one talks.

8. Book: Talking to Strangers by Malcolm Gladwell

This one will mess with your head in the best way. Gladwell explores how badly we understand people we don’t know and how it leads to huge misunderstandings. Compelling case studies, surprising studies. This book forces you to improve your people-reading instincts.

9. Trick to practice: 3-second rule

You have 3 seconds after noticing someone before your brain starts making excuses. If you don’t take action in that tiny window, fear escalates. Train yourself to act within those 3 seconds. Just walk up and say hi before the overthinking kicks in.

10. Trick to stand out: the “genuine compliment plus crooked question”

Instead of “Hey, you’re cute,” try “That’s an amazing book choice. Is that your favorite author or just a random pick?” It compliments + gives them something to respond to. It’s rare. It works like magic.

11. Practice in low-stakes environments

The more you do it in chill places, the easier it gets. Start conversations in bookstores, waiting rooms, retail stores. Don’t only rely on dating apps. The people with the best social energy are out practicing like athletes. A cold approach isn’t creepy if you lead with curiosity, not agenda.

This is basically the playbook I wish I had five years ago. Social skills aren’t talent its that they’re trainable. It’s not about turning into someone else. It’s about becoming more of your relaxed, confident self around people you actually like.

I'll go first.,"Context: I started my freelance journey last March 2025 but got hired late May 2025. So my POV would be from someone who just started this year.

**""Comparison is a thief of Joy""**

Ito talaga ang biggest lesson ko in this journey. 

Lalo na cguro na madaming mga nag p-post about having premium clients who give them MacBooks, bonuses and other incentives. You tend to envy those people kasi. Gusto mo rin ganun ang client mo sayo.  
  
At first, my definition of a premium client kasi was someone mabait, hindi lowballer, hindi nag micromanage and someone who appreciates, and then the more I read stories here on how lucky they are sa clients nila na binibigyan ng gadgets, I became a bit jealous and hopeful na my client would do the same saken and a little bit sad na hindi sya ganun (huhu i knowwww. the audacity of me na first timer pa)

There were moments talaga na I wished he *is* that type of client.

But then it kind of dawns on me, Oo he might not be the type to give big bonuses like giving a macbook but he is the type of client who makes sure to appreciate my output. He apologizes for sudden workloads for me. He always make sure im still enjoying my work as well (i'm a video editor) and never micromanages me.

And last pay day, he asked why hindi ko ininclude ang iced coffee and birthday cake ko sa invoice last month, birthday ko kasi last Nov huhu he and his fiancee was so sweet to do that for me.

*ah, self. you are already lucky. why are you comparing yourself sa ibang freelancers/ remote workers? you'll end up missing everything when you are already living the prayers you prayed for.*  
  
So yun, na realize ko na masyado akong nadala sa mga posts about having a more generous client when my own client is already one of the best na pala.  
  
So if you think nasa ganitong phase ka sa freelance/Remote Work journey mo, always remember na **Comparison is a thief of Joy.** Wag magpadala sa blessings ng iba bc you both have different timelines, different lives, and different paths. Wag e compare and feel dissatisfied (unless u are really lowballed, that's a different story na ha. Know your worth)  
  
and last week, my client is already hinting me of my promotion plan before the year ends.

2025 was such a roller coaster ride for me. From hundreds of applications & interviews, I landed sa client na para sa akin talaga.

Nothing wrong with that — it’s just not what my family speaks, and she wanted to understand the local language when we visit Portugal: the slang, the expressions, the history… all the little everyday things.

So I started creating resources for her — super European Portuguese, built around culture and real daily life:

• Expressions like *“Está-se bem”*, *“Tá giro”*, *“Desenrascar”*, *“Fixe”*

• Little cultural nuggets (why Portuguese people always apologize for cold weather 😂)

• History and discoveries, because our language carries our past

• Regional accents — that sweet Lisbon “shhh” vs. a strong Norte “rrrr”

• Words you actually hear at the café, in the metro, in supermarkets

It became a fun project between us, and honestly I’ve learned so much about my own culture while trying to explain it to a foreigner.

European Portuguese isn’t only vocabulary — it’s the rhythm, the attitude, that slightly sarcastic kindness, and the love of long coffees and longer conversations.

So… I’m curious:

What are the expressions or cultural insights that *you* wish every learner knew from the beginning?

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1pfoxaq,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1pfoxaq/brother_physically_assaulted_me_this_is_the_final/,Brother physically assaulted me this is the final straw.,"Context. I'm done. Geniually fucking done. I can't fucking take shit anymore. My narccicist parents are the resourse deprivation kind. Yk. Looking for any excuse to avoid responsibilities, giving food of any kind, clothes, truthfully would let me rot if not for the stategies i've emoloyed with them to manipulate them into actually giving me the bare minimum if that to survive. I hate them. I'm 23M, I decided to stop work to focus on study, I'l grayrock them and leave them notes/not maintain eye contact, to create cognitive dissonance in my parents. Enough of this repeated behavior for weeks will make them do anything I need. 

Actual incident: I rely on coffee to calm down my cptsd. They failed to get me that. So my symptoms were a little worse then normal. I have trouble sleeping and my general mood and life quality can be off and on depending on the day so can my sleep quality. I was in a worse mood. At 4AM. My brother is slamming on the door. My narccicist performative mother stupidly decides to open the door because instead of choosing our safety she sees a supply attempt. My brother is violent from taking alcohol and prob doing drugs. He punches her in the mouth. I try to move in front of her to defend her (not that I give a single fuck about her, but because, well, the guy rn is acting fucking insane.) But she won't let me. I get winded. She's screaming escalating and making a big scene (for supply) siblings are screaming he continues his assault by screaming and causing a giant scene. He attacks my ""father."" My memorys a lil foggy but I go back to my room for a moment. Come back out everybodies in my sisters room. He continues to assault my father and mother slamming them on the ground. It seems like he wanted to attack my siblings or is getting scarily close to that point tho I can't confirm this. That was just my gut feelings. At this point while everybodys huddled in the room I get ready to defend myself. He punches me in my left eye. I remember immediately choosing deescalation after that because I geniually didn't think I cud take the guy on he was double my size. I said ""whoa, calm down."" And he just kind of stared at me. I was still getting ready to fight before  my ""mom"" does the only smart thing she would do this entire night and tells me to call the cops. Despite my pride and sense of justice being on the line and wanting to fight this guy still. Given how much more messier he made my grip on the fucking dynamic. I called the cops and told them everything. Called two more times to make sure they got the adress right. Brother went downstairs. My sister claims they immediately locked the downstairs door. But I overheard her saying to lock it significantly after so I don't believe her. He tries to get upstairs again im pretty sure. But its locked. He kept saying Dominican slang for some batshit reason. And then eventually gave up and made a break for it like the pussy he is. Always running away from his fucking problems. 

Cops finally arrive. While I was in my room I think my mother was blocking the cops when they were trying to get in. Bc they said something about needing to go thru. She (supply attempt) kept talking about how he was a monster and a psycho, and shes a poor christian, how he bruised her mouth, how shes a mother, how shes scared for her kids (all lies she doesn't care abt us at all even if we died, christian bullshit was just an attempt at getting as much sympathy points as possible.) She kept airing my name claiming I ""defended"" the family. When she was in my way the entire time, prob as an attempt to create closeness with me thru fuck ass trauma bonding, not falling for it.
Eventually after continue to ramble, talk abt unnecessary details, I come outside. Cops think I'm him when I'm clearly not. They interrogate me. Despite the fact my ""mother"" said he threatend to murder us. Cops were way too kind and generous to me. Instead of immediately arresting me, they said ""they wanted to make sure I was ok"" and to ""get me checkedout"" Yk despite the fact that from their perspective they thought I was the guy that yk did all that horrible horseshit and was a danger to myself and others. They go to my room. Keep investigating me. I didn't even realize I was bein interrogated until they said for their safety they didn't want me to get up. When my mother finally cleared the air, they stopped interogating me. Despite the fact he ran off and was god knows where. Everything seemed like it was gonna be for the best. My father was talkin abt him like he hated him. My mother was nippin the bud by talkin abt how dangerous he was. It seemed like a situation that was gonna end positively in him gettin some serious jailtime for this. Then my father says the dumb idiotic line of ""Its the drugs that make him crazy"" ""When he's not on drugs or alcohol hes fine"" then its either my siblings or mom who support that statement. ""Yeah its the drugs, normally he's fine"" My father despite the fact that every couple years this guy does a massive assault bc of his alcohol and were basically enemy #1 rn. Thinks the best approach is too not press charges????? Despite the fact, according to my mom he said he wanted to kill us all. 

I was sitting there, couldn't help but utter outloud to myself he was a dumb fuck. You're seriously gonna let a guy who did that much damage go????

My mother keeps parading even after the fact, making it abt her, her, her, claiming she cares abt her kids, that that hes still out there, that shes afraid to go to work (even tho she doesn't have too) (that her kid are gonna be alone, and he cud come back) even tho she could press charges, stay home, and yk actually do smth other then sit there with her thumb up her but I digress) but besides one little interjection, supporting the idea hes let off the hook. Yeah. Shes mostly all on board the guy gets no jail time and just has to get cutesy little rehab. Its actually hilarious because if I ever physically asaulted anyone, i'd go to jail, i'd have 30 cops on me. I'd be seen as a monster. This family wud do everything in their power to make sure I get pushed to the fullest extent of the law. But bc he choose to drink and take drugs. Instead of being arrested for the danger he is. He gets empathetic cops and gets rehab. Rehab. Fucking rehab. Wonderful. Briliant. My life cud be in danger. He cud come back at any point with a weapon for any reason. Cud drink and do drugs again which most people wud after an incident like that. And yet. Let off the hook. Barely a slap on the wrist. Fucking. Insanity. 

I sat there in my room. At first I blamed myself. Saying I shud have been stronger. Feeling powerless. Feeling as if the weight of the world was one my shoulders. I was a big guy. I pride myself on my strength. Why'd I freeze up? Why'd I run away? This geniually was the first time in my life I felt powerless physically. I always felt powerless emotionally. But physically that was foreign. Eventually I decided that if I was gonna have to sit here, with a mom I knew was gonna use this as an oppurtunity to ignore every responsibility thrown her way, and was gonna leave me in the dark when it came to even just having 
food, let alone anything else I need bc the supply of this situation is like stars in her fucking eyes. That I was gonna keep moving out of spite. If my grip on the family dyanmic was gonna be destroyed, if my life was geniually gonna be in danger, if nobody was gonna accept responsibility. Then i'd keep moving in spite of that asshole brother who just had to make my already shitty life worse, and i'd tough the terrible situation only being exsasperated by my moms neglect. Just to spite them. To embody the idea that this world, them, everybody has never given me a single goddamn chance, and i'm not gonna let the world smite me down. That I deserved better. And that I wud do everything in my power to not let these assholes fucking win.

After that unsurpsingly my mom left me with no food. Coffee zero. Fathers in my mothers room most likely praying to his fake fucking god. As if he hasn't destroyed my life by being the first hand in this psychotic fucking delusional enviorment. At this point ignoring the fact I'm only moving and not shutting down bc I don't wanna give these people the satisfaction, I am seeing what I can do abt leaving atleast for today. Maybe contacting a friend or someone, to allow me to calm down and give me an idea as to how to move forward. It hurts bc I truly have no one who cud offer me a place to stay. Maybe my father but I haven't even contacted him in a year. 

That asshole cud be here any minute, any second, with any intention. And I wud be powerless. But if he tries to hurt me hes gonna get one hell of a fight. Because I wont give him the satisfaction of being someone who just fucking submits. 

Final part; I tell my siblings my mom made the situation worse, (she objectively did) they unsurprsingly defend her. I'm not there to argue i'm there to set the facts straight bc i'm angry. I tell them she did everything wrong. They say shes a victim. I say i'm a fucking victim too, and unlike her who was only in it for the attention, who was escalating, making the situation worse. I choose to make the best choices I cud. That that isn't an excuse. I told them i'd be leaving. Sister manipulates me (wow ur not gonna protect us?) I clap back: No its not my responsibility too. I tell them the guy is public enemy #1 that he does assaults every 4 years. That were gonna have targets on our backs, that rehab wouldn't do jack shit. That rehab and jail were an option and everybody fucking ruined that. They tell me to stop shouting and talking. I keep complaining. Not even a pot of coffee, not even any aort of food. I'm done I'm gone. And I slam my door. 

Fucking asenine. I hate this family. 5 hours of sleep. No fucking coffee. No food of any kind. Everybody put us in potentional danger including the cops. I have no where to go besides a an abusive narc biological father. Friends cant help for shit. My hold on the dynamic destroyed. Espesially gaslighty siblings. Fuck this shit.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1pfov9p,https://i.redd.it/38sdb4mo0l5g1.png,Behind the Music (Album Release): Ain't No Quit In This River,"[Ain't No Quit In This River.](https://open.spotify.com/album/4Yhjh8VapdlwNDWPQEvcWx?si=o8D4jWujQ8uwMwVAv2P3hg) My First full album release.

This project is an anthology. Every track is its own short story, but they all live in the same neighborhood.

Two big threads hold it together:

1. The fusion sound: folk and bluegrass roots sitting on top of trap and modern production.
2. Human grit: how people hurt, cope, love, fail, and still keep going.

I am not trying to sell this as a concept album with a grand storyline. It is a collection of moments I care about, stitched together by the same voice and the same Bayou in my head.

Below is what each song is doing and why it exists.

# 1. Steps in the Dust

Instrumental folk trap fusion

This is the thesis track. No lyrics. Just sound.

I wanted to prove the fusion works before I start talking about it. Acoustic strings, folk textures, and then modern rhythm underneath. The point is simple: these worlds can live together without one side feeling like a gimmick.

It opens the door and tells you what kind of universe you just walked into.



# 2. Eyes in the Dark

Tom Waits inspired piece

This one is a quiet thank you to Tom Waits.

I am not trying to imitate him. I am trying to honor the crooked, smoky storytelling that pulled me in when I first heard him. Uneven edges, late night energy, characters that feel like they wandered in from the back of a bar.

It is my way of saying, I learned a lot from this man, and some of that leaks through here.



# 3. Puppet Wires

Toxic relationship and manipulation

This song is about control that hides behind the word love.

Puppet Wires looks at the moment you finally see the strings that have been there the whole time. It is less about screaming and more about that cold, quiet realization: I have been managed, nudged, and handled, and I helped.

The production stays focused on the tension. It is a psychological song, not a fireworks song.



# 4. Songs Against the Dark

Primal folk trap fusion about the power of music

Here I am treating music like a survival instinct.

This track is about how rhythm and melody can feel primal, like a campfire for the nervous system. Something to gather around when everything else feels hostile. The fusion is loud here on purpose. Old and new collide and push back against the dark together.

This is one of the clearest statements of what the whole project is trying to do sonically.



# 5. The Spaces I Gave Away

Escapism, substance use, tech abuse

This one is a confession about avoidance.

It looks at all the little ways we hand our life away instead of facing pain directly. Substances. Screens. Endless scrolling. All the numbing tricks that feel harmless in the moment and brutal in the long run.

The title says it pretty plainly. You do not just lose time. You give away pieces of yourself.



# 6. Peace in the Ordinary

Gratitude for small blessings

This is the reset button in the middle of the record.

I wanted a track that sits in a smaller frame. Coffee that tastes good. A quiet room. A kid laughing in the next room. Nothing big. Just the kind of things you only notice when you stop chasing a larger idea of victory.

It slows the emotional tempo and reminds both me and the listener that a lot of real peace lives in plain sight.



# 7. The Unwritten Song

Grief for someone taken too young

This song is about lives that stop mid sentence.

On the surface it is about a specific family member, but it is meant to hold space for anyone taken too soon. It is grief without a clean arc. No tidy lesson. Just the heavy feeling of knowing there was so much left unwritten.

I tried to keep it straightforward and honest, without poetic tricks to soften the blow.



# 8. My Best Friend

Losing a dog, losing your anchor

Simple idea: a man loses his dog and loses his only real friend at the same time.

Pet loss is easy to meme and easy to underestimate. In real life, it can break people. This song sits inside that quiet heartbreak. It does not try to dress it up. It just tells the truth about what it feels like when your one steady companion is gone.



# 9. Clapped Out

The grind for family and responsibility

This track is about exhaustion that still shows up to work.

Clapped Out follows someone who is running on fumes but keeps going because there are people depending on them. Not for glory. Not for Instagram. Just so the lights stay on and the kids eat.

The rhythm has a forward lean on purpose. It feels like dragging your body out of bed for the fiftieth time this month and doing it anyway.



# 10. You Get the Smoke

Hater anthem for bandwagon critics

This is the perimeter defense song.

It is aimed at the people who did not care when you were building in the dark, but suddenly want to attach themselves when they sense momentum. It is petty in a fun way. Confident, sharp, and not interested in being polite.

You Get the Smoke lets that side of the story speak without apology.



# 11. Pressure Cooker

Finally pushing back after too much

This is the breaking point song.

You follow a person who has swallowed their anger for years, always playing nice, always avoiding conflict. Then something small tips the scale and all of that bottled pressure comes out.

It is meant to feel tense and a little uncomfortable. Sometimes a snap is ugly, but it is also honest.



# 12. The Customer Is Always Right

Bluegrass trap tip of the hat to Charlie Daniels

This one is my nod to The Devil Went Down to Georgia.

It takes that kind of narrative energy and drops it into a bluegrass trap fusion frame. Fiddle style lines, storytelling verses, and modern drums under the whole thing. The point was not to parody Charlie Daniels, but to say, this form still works, even if you swap out the engine.

It is one of the most playful tracks on the album.



# 13. Forgive the Wanderer

Prodigal son style folk piece

Forgive the Wanderer lives in the same emotional space as the prodigal son.

Someone who ran far, did damage, and finally looks back toward home. No guarantee they will be welcomed. No guarantee they deserve it. Just the pull to return and the fear that comes with it.

The song leans more traditional in tone to match the theme of coming back to your roots.



# 14. The Future You Carry

Breaking cycles for your kids

This song is about putting a hard stop on generational damage.

You may not fix yourself completely. You may not get a tidy healing arc. But you can decide that certain patterns stop with you. The focus is on the quiet choices that do not make headlines but completely change the trajectory for your children.

It is one of the heavier songs conceptually, even if it does not shout.



# 15. Ain’t No Quit in This River

Victory song

This is the closer for a reason.

After all the loss, pressure, wandering, and grind, this track is about persistence. Not the movie version where everything ends in fireworks, but the version where you are still here, still trying, still moving.

The river in the title is the through line. It just keeps flowing. That is the win.  You can't stop the flood.



# What This Album Is Trying To Do

This album is a weekly fragment mindset scaled up into a full collection.

It is:

* Folk and bluegrass storytelling fused with trap and modern rhythm
* Character stories about grief, love, failure, work, and small courage
* A proof of concept that this sound and this release style can hold real emotion

It is not perfect on purpose. It is alive. It is me testing how far this fusion and this pace can go while still telling honest human stories.

 Chapter 1
During summer vacation, I took my kid to the amusement park and ran into a brother I'd once gone through life and death with.

He grabbed my sleeve, sobbing uncontrollably.

""Liv, where have you been all these years?""

""Do you have any idea how crazy Alex has been looking for you?""

""Just... just seeing you alive is enough. I'm calling Alex right now!""

The 'Alex' he mentioned was Alexander Grant, our leader from our days running the streets, and my ex-boyfriend.

Seven years ago, when he was laundering his company clean to go legit, we were supposed to get married.

But on the day we were headed to the city hall, he received an email that convinced him I'd betrayed him.

So, following the code of the streets, he publicly broke my right hand and declared he was done with me.

But I'd made too many rivals during my time by his side.

After that day, I became everyone's favorite target.

Hunted and alone, I simply couldn't take it anymore. So I set a fire and vanished without a trace.

And now, coming back, he tells me Alexander Grant has been searching for me like a madman.

I laughed and waved towards a little boy running wild not far away.

""Let me introduce you to my son. He's four years old.""

......

....

The tall, burly man cried in front of me for a long time before I finally recognized him.

But he can't really blame me for that.

My eyes were damaged bad in a fight years back, and my memory's... spotty in places.

The big guy was still crying.

""Liv, come back with me, please?""

""Alex hasn't been himself all these years. The rest of the crew... they all scattered.""

I pulled my sleeve free, feeling none of the excitement of running into someone from the past.

""I'm not going back.""

Big Guy wiped his tears, pressing urgently.

""Why?""

He paused, his lips trembling slightly before he whispered, ""Liv, do you still hate him for what happened seven years ago?""

""But Alex regrets it! He took down everyone who ever laid a hand on you!""

""He said... he said you're the only woman he'll ever marry!""

I tried to smirk, but the nerve damage in my face made it impossible, ""Alexander Grant and I are through.""

Big Guy looked at me, his expression full of things left unsaid, his wide eyes screaming disbelief.

Yeah, I got it.

Back in the day, everyone in Oakvale knew Alexander Grant had a pit bull by his side.

She looked like a saint but had the soul of a killer but there was nothing she wouldn't do for him.

She'd even stepped in front of a bullet for him. More than once.

And now, his most loyal soldier was saying she and Alex were done.

No one would buy that.

Hell, I wouldn't have believed it myself.

There was a time I thought I'd be by Alexander Grant's side forever.

We'd been together since we were ten, in the same orphanage.

Countless nights, we'd just hold each other in the dark, licking our wounds together.

But the year Alex finally succeeded in making his company legitimate, a girl named Chloe King showed up at the firm.

She was lively, bright, and had this kind of innocent, wide-eyed purity.

Everyone in the office adored her.

Unlike me.

Brooding, rarely smiling, like some wild mushroom growing in a dark, damp corner.

Those were Alex's exact words, actually.

That day, Chloe messed up again.

She spilled an entire cup of coffee all over a crucial contract.

I frowned, ready to read her the riot act.

Out of nowhere, Alex appeared, grabbing my arm, ""Hey, ease up. It was an accident.""

He said it while winking at Chloe, whose eyes were already welling up, silently telling her to scram.

Fuming, I shook off his hand.

Alex shrugged helplessly and let out a long sigh.

""Liv, isn't it ironic?""

""Look at us. Surviving in the filth, pretending we still have a right to something clean.""

I stood there frozen, staring up at him in a daze.

His gaze was fixed on Chloe's retreating back, a complicated look in his eyes.

It took a long moment, only after Chloe had disappeared around the corner, for him to turn back to me.

He looked at me seriously and said, ""We don't see many girls as genuine as Chloe King these days. Let's not be the ones to shatter that innocence.""

In that moment, it felt like my heart was stuffed with a whole, raw lemon.

So sour and bitter I thought I might cry.

But I just quietly hid my scar-covered hands behind my back.

Chapter 2
Alex transferred Chloe to be his personal secretary.

No matter how big a mistake Chloe made, Alex would just laugh it off.

But he'd never been the patient type before.

Gradually, the rumors started swirling.

All about how a harsh woman like me, tougher than most men, wasn't exactly wife material.

The resentment and insecurity inside me grew day by day.

So, I tried to subtly complain to Alex, ""People are saying you and Chloe are involved. Can't you transfer her somewhere else?""

Alex was busy reviewing a contract. He glanced at me with an amused, knowing look.

""Liv, you really think I'd trust any woman but you to share my bed?""

I frowned, about to say that wasn't the point, when the office door burst open.

Chloe came stumbling in, arms piled high with files.

As she passed me, her ankle twisted, and files went flying everywhere.

Alex, who'd just been buried in paperwork, actually chuckled and got up to help Chloe gather the scattered pages.

I stood there, watching them for a long moment, before finally turning and walking out, my steps unsteady.

As I left, I glanced back.

Chloe was blushing, sticking her tongue out playfully, and Alex was shaking his head, a wry smile on his face.

Over this, Alex and I had a rare fight.

I refused to say more than a few necessary words to him outside of work.

Until one night, Tommy called me, his words slurred.

""Liv, the boss is wasted, keeps calling your name.""

""Can you come get him?""

""Seriously, you two need to cut this out. The boss has been in a foul mood, and it's putting the whole crew on edge.""

While helping a very drunk Alex into the car, I kept my face stony and silent.

Suddenly, once inside, he wrapped an arm around my waist and yanked hard.

I lost my balance and tumbled into his lap.

His voice was hoarse in my ear,""Liv, stop being mad.""

""In this whole world, it's only you I trust. It's only you I want.""

I instinctively nuzzled my face into the crook of his neck, feeling my eyes well up.

My voice softened as I reached up to touch his flushed cheek.

""Alex, let's get married. Okay?""

There was no response.

I looked up and saw his eyes were closed; he'd passed out.

Pushing down my disappointment, I was about to shut the car door when a familiar, teasing voice came from behind.

""Well, if it isn't little Liv?""

I turned. ""Mr. Black.""

Victor Black was Alex's sworn rival.

They'd fought over turf when they were young.

Now they fought over business deals.

He leaned to the side, peering into the car at Alex.

""Word is, Alex is done with you.""

I frowned.

Victor grinned, ""Perfect timing. Why not come with me instead?""

""At least I'm not incompetent enough to let a woman take so many hits for me.""

Then, he dragged out his next words, heavy with implication, ""That night, we got along pretty well, didn't we?""

I narrowed my eyes in warning, ""Mr. Black, you're drunk.""

Victor laughed, raising his hands in mock surrender.

""Alright, alright, I'll drop it.""

I watched his retreating back and took a deep, heavy breath.

That was from years ago, when Alex was framed and facing prison time.

Victor had offered to help.

I asked him what he wanted in return.

Bizarrely, he'd said he only wanted me to play video games with him all night.

And I did.

As I drove, I pondered why Victor had brought that up now.

Suddenly, Alex, from the passenger seat, mumbled like he was talking in his sleep.

""Liv, why did Victor Black agree to help me three years ago?""

I steadied myself, about to voice my suspicions.

But the next second, Alex's slurred voice came again.

""That night... was it really just video games with him?""

I slammed on the brakes, feeling like I'd been sucker-punched.

""Alex, what are you implying?""

He seemed to have sunk back into a dead drunk stupor, slumped in the seat without another sound.

My fingers twitched uncontrollably on the steering wheel.

I understood Victor's game now. He'd planted a seed of doubt between me and Alex.

I looked at Alex's face, my voice trembling as I whispered, ""Alex, please believe me. Nothing happened between me and Victor Black.""

His eyelashes fluttered slightly in the dim streetlight, but he remained silent and still.

And I knew. He didn't believe me.

The truth of it stung, and tears began to fall.

Chapter 3
After that night, I grew much quieter.

Alex probably noticed, but he chose to paper over the cracks, pretending nothing was wrong.

I felt wronged and disappointed. But I could only cling to the hope that one day, we'd sit down and clear the air, untangle all the misunderstandings.

But that day never came.

Then, Chloe made the biggest mistake since joining the company.

She emailed the company's confidential bidding floor price to the entire mailing list.

By the time anyone realized, the project had been snatched away.

This project was key to the company's transformation.

Furious, I immediately told her to pack her things and get out.

Chloe whimpered, ""Mr. Grant...""

My body stiffened for a second.

Alex's light, calm voice came from behind me, ""You've really outdone yourself this time.""

Chloe let out a choked sob and ran out of the room.

I didn't turn around, just kept my head down, organizing the files on my desk.

Alex walked over and took my hand, ""Liv, how about meatloaf for dinner tonight?""

""I've been craving your meatloaf.""

My hand stilled.

Meatloaf was our peace offering.

Every time we fought, it always ended with a plate of that.

I gave a muffled ""Mhm.""

But when I tried to leave early to buy meat from the market, just as I reached the parking garage, a dark figure emerged and slammed me hard against the car.

""Liv, I think you owe me an explanation.""

I recognized the familiar cologne and struggled frantically, trying to look back.

""Alex, what are you talking about?""

He patted my cheek, his tone turning dark, ""Liv, Victor Black won that project today.""

""Funny coincidence, don't you think?""

I held back, but finally couldn't take it anymore, a sob catching in my throat as I shot back, ""Alexander! Chloe was the one who leaked the price! What does that have to do with me?!""

""Chloe said you used her computer that day too!""

""Olivia Green! Was it really Chloe, or was it you?!""

In that instant, a sharp pain shot through every part of my body, converging on my heart.

It hurt so much I couldn't even struggle anymore, just whispered, barely audible, ""Alex, you said you trusted me.""

""You said you only trusted me.""

How did it come to this?

Alex's body went rigid. He let me go and took two steps back.

He hung his head, avoiding my eyes, ""Liv, you also promised you'd never betray me.""

""I'll get to the bottom of this.""

I leaned against the car, tears blurring my vision.

No matter how hard I blinked, I couldn't see his face clearly.

""Alexander, maybe we should break up—""

Before I could finish the sentence, I caught a dark, blurry movement in my peripheral vision.

My heart leaped. Instinct took over, and I shoved Alex away.

Before everything went black, I saw my own blood splatter across his horrified face.

He was screaming my name.

As if I were the most important person in the world to him.

I woke up in the hospital.

Alex was by my bedside, looking haggard.

Before I could even open my mouth to speak, he'd already taken my hand and slipped a silver band onto my finger, ""Liv, marry me.""

I stared dumbly at the ring on my finger, unable to process it for a long moment.

""As soon as you're discharged, we'll go to the city hall, okay?""

""We'll make it work this time.""

I couldn't say yes. But I couldn't say no either.

I could only stay silent. Yet, I couldn't help the treacherous flicker of hope, wondering if there really could be a future for us.

We'd been adrift for so long since leaving the orphanage. The temptation of a real home was something I just couldn't resist.

On the day I was discharged, Alex was all set to take me to get our marriage license.

He held me close, telling me he'd gotten a cat, the one I'd always wanted, and it was waiting for me at home. Soon, we'd be a family of three.

Chapter 4
I leaned against him, listening quietly, my vision blurring with unshed tears.

But when the car was just one block away from the City Hall, his phone rang.

He shot me a dark, unreadable look, then coldly told the driver to get out.

Alex practically flew back to the old, dusty warehouse where we'd first started out.

My face pale, I asked him, ""Why are you bringing me here?""

Alex got out without a word, then roughly dragged me out of the car.

""Liv, you know me better than anyone.""

Confused, I tried to pull my hand free. ""Alexander, let go of me! You're hurting my injury!""

He gave a cold laugh, pushed open the grimy door, and shoved me inside.

""You planned this whole 'damsel in distress' act perfectly, didn't you? Knowing I wouldn't dare touch you after that, and would even marry you?""

I landed awkwardly on the floor. When I looked up, I froze.

The small main room was packed with people.

All the old crew who'd followed Alex back in the day.

They were all looking at me with complicated expressions.

I stared blankly, then turned to look at Alex.

Alex snorted and threw his phone onto my lap.

It was open to a report, clearly detailing my movements over the past few months.

Photos of me supposedly meeting with Victor Black were circled in red.

But I hadn't met with Victor at all.

I looked up at Alex, ""Alexander, this report is fake.""

He crouched down, pinching my chin, his tone sarcastic.

""Liv, I wanted to believe you. I really did. But I even have video of you and Victor together.""

""I gave you chance after chance, and you played me for a fool.""

""Since that's how it is, we have to treat you like the traitor you are.""

The code was clear, betrayal meant losing a hand or a foot.

My hands shaking, I clutched at Alex's sleeve.

""I told you, I didn't do it!""

""If you want to interrogate me, I'll cooperate fully!""

""But, Alexander, you can't do this to me!""

""I've been by your side since we were ten! I've taken knives for you!""

""Alexander, you said you trusted me!""

I stared straight into Alex's eyes.

He seemed to waver for a split second, but a moment later, his gaze turned hard and cold again.

He looked down at me, his face impassive.

""Fine. Then it'll be your hand.""

""I'll do it myself.""

He grabbed my right hand.

My tears fell onto the back of his hand. I begged him in a whisper, ""Please, Alex, I'm begging you, I didn't betray you, please believe me.""

""Can't you just investigate a little more?""

But his only answer was to pick up a steel pipe and bring it down hard.

That day, amidst my agonized screams, Alexander Grant said calmly, ""Liv, this is the price of betrayal.""

""From now on, you and I have nothing to do with each other.""

He cast me out. But the list of people we'd pissed off over the years was just too long.

They descended on me like hyenas smelling blood.

I spent my days hiding in dark corners.

My eyes were ruined by my rivals. Old injuries were piled on with new ones.

Eventually, I just couldn't keep going.

So I went back to the abandoned orphanage, and right in front of the people hunting me, I set it on fire.

Then, covered in wounds, I quietly left Oakvale.

Now, seven years have passed.

The things that happened still haunt me like nightmares.

And Alexander Grant says he'll only ever marry me.

I took the phone from Big Guy's hand as he was about to dial.

""I don't want to see Alexander Grant.""

Big Guy grew frantic, starting to say something.

I waved towards someone behind him, cutting him off.

""Let me introduce you to my son. He's four years old.""",1,1765026076.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

*Contact is made with Dawn's indigenous life, and Zed's part in it is revealed.*

The ‘Cetacean Team’ as we dubbed ourselves, met the next morning after the people finished breakfast, held in a room at HQ, set up as a conference room with all the needed interface and video equipment you’d expect.

“So, how’d you make out with the data analysis?” Tam asked, as he and Commander Adam sat down with their coffees.

Mom spoke first “we identified that click/squeak sequences were frequently repeated, appearing to be structured as a preamble, a message section, and a postamble.  In exchanges that seemed as call-and-response exchanges between two sources at similar locations, the preamble and postamble sequences get inverted- a two way conversation perhaps. There are examples of a call not being answered in short order, and the same call is repeated. If there is then a response, subsequent exchanges have longer pauses between them- we’re guessing a longer distance communication. “

Helena put down her teacup and added, “our theory is the preamble is the addressee of the message, the postamble the signature, or sender.  If we call those pre and post amble sequences as the names of individuals, we have recordings for eighteen individuals that are heard by the hydrophone.  There is one preamble that hasn’t been heard as a postamble. That may be an ‘all call’ signal that is often responded to by more than one individual. We’ve seen a few examples where there are back and forth exchanges with no pre or postambles, but those seem to be co-located, maybe close range chatter.

“There are two individuals that speak significantly more often than the rest, especially using the ‘all call’ preamble. Those calls seem to get the most multi-answer responses- pod leaders, maybe- doing an ‘everyone check in’ request, or ‘something of interest to all’ announcement.

Tam nodded slowly. “That’s a lot to chew on. So… if we’re right, we’ve got syntax, turn-taking, and maybe even social hierarchy in play.”

“That’s pretty good progress for one overnight of analysis. What’s the next step?” Asked the Commander.

“Now that we seem to have a structural model theory that seems to fit”, Starwise contributed, we’re working on teasing out sequences that function as words, and doing a frequency analysis of how common they are, where in an exchange they occur, and if time-of-day makes any difference.  We can’t assume they use a noun/adjective/verb type structure like we do.  Earth dolphins don’t among themselves, but do when talking to us - they developed a separate language for human-interaction- additional evidence of their intelligence.

I questioned Zed - he said his people had some interaction with the sealife; they used a ‘thinking machine’ like we AI to translate.  They didn’t get very far beyond basic exchanges, but he doesn’t remember details.  My experience with working out a common language with Zed is helping a little; a bit of a template to hang ideas on.” “Well, let’s get back together in two days to check progress, meanwhile, continue analysing whatever they’re saying, see if we can get any closer to some working phrases.  Good work so far.” the Commander concluded, standing up to go check in with other teams.

Two Mornings Later —---------------------------- The ‘Cetacean Team’ reconvened to review progress in decoding the chatter being heard over the hydrophone.

Starwise started. “We’ve analyzed a good bit more data from the sealife, and are getting a better understanding of the ‘vocabulary’ in use and a bit of their habits.  We’ve realized that they seem to be mostly diurnal; much more chatter during daylight hours, with dawn and sunset being busiest. From the timing of longer distance conversations versus short range ones, an explanation that fits is they stay overnight in the bay near our hydrophone, and leave the area shortly after sunrise, returning near dusk. Perhaps going out in the deep for feeding during the day.”

Helene continued,”We’ve isolated a few phases that are common in the morning busy period that are all-call from the subordinate individuals that are then answered by a few individuals, no particular pattern to who responds. We are theorizing that these are morning greeting phrases to the pod.“

“Commander,” Starwise asked, ” I’d like to attempt sending out a ‘hello’ message. Send an all-call, a simple greeting message, sign with a unique sequence similar to one of the non-leaders. Then we’ll record and analyze any response, and go from there.  We’d time the message in the morning, as they are becoming active, but before they start heading out for the day. We have a message queued up and could do it right now, if you authorize…”

“An easy start, similar to how we started with Zed.”Commander nodded in agreement.  “That is within established protocol. Keep the volume level low, If there isn’t an immediate response, you may send the message no more than five times, then stand by, keep listening, and we’ll discuss next steps then.  I never expected this mission would have multiple ‘first contacts’ but it’s looking that way. Remarkable. I authorize you to proceed.”

“Are you ready, Starwise?, this may be pretty momentous …Another ‘I was there-moment’  Tam offered with a smile.

“Ready to go, on your word, Commander. The next moment it is quiet, I’ll send it, not to talk over another.”  Starwise offered

There were two voices having an exchange, then it fell quiet. “Sending now, we’ll give it ten seconds before I retry.” The call went out, clearly audible on the hydrophone.  A count up clock started on a screen, awaiting a response. After ten seconds, the call was repeated, using a different message from the list of probable messages.  
Three seconds delay this time, and a response is heard, the identifier Starwise had chosen, the sequence the team had identified as a general interrogatory, and signed by one of the pod  leaders.

“That was one of the pod leaders responding, with a question.” Starwise offered. “We have a phrase that seems to be a general purpose ‘acknowledged’- send it?”

“Go ahead, it might be interpreted as rude or disrespectful to not respond at all- proceed.” The Commander instructed. “We’ve knocked on their door, they’ve answered ‘Who’s there?’, apparently.”

Starwise sent the acknowledgement message.

Tam had been watching a monitor showing the wharf, where the hydrophone was located. “Do we have anyone down there right now? Look at the monitor.  There’s something going on down at the wharf.”  Everyone turned their attention to the screen.  The lighting wasn't the best, but it could be easily seen that there was movement in the water.  A dark, round shape slowly arose from the surface next to where the monitoring equipment and hydrophone was placed. It paused for a moment, then retreated.

Another message was received. Starwise interpreted. “That was from the same speaker. Response is what we could approximate as ‘wait’ or ‘stand by’; I’ll send an acknowledgement.”

“Well, team, I think we can add another star next to our record- we’ve now opened communications with our second extra-terrestrial intelligence.” The Commander added. “Let’s stand by for now, and continue monitoring and analyzing. Well done.”

The Next Morning —---------------------------- It dawned a rare grey, drizzly morning, with a low fog bank hugging the seashore, with the cliffside HQ building above the fog.  The coprocessors monitoring the various cameras chimed an alarm of a change at the waterfront.  Starwise and Commander Adam logged in at the same time to investigate.  Something had washed up onto the beach next to the wharf- something definitely of artificial construction, that looked like it had been underwater for a very long time.

“Get a detail down there for a closer look, Elana. Take that mobile droid with Starwise and Pop logged in, grab Curtis and two additional persons of your choice.  Security protocol C. Let’s get some eyes on that thing.  Starwise, in case it’s an artifact from Zed’s people, log him in to help with analysis.” the Commander ordered.

The group pulled up to the beach in the utility buggy with the humans already in their environmental suits.  They got out, clipped safety lines to the buggy and advanced.  Elana, Curtis, and the droid with Starwise and Pop advanced close to the artifact, the other two stayed back, each holding a safety line, to pull Curtis or Elana back to safety if necessary.  Security Protocol C may have been overkill for this situation, but so far, no injuries on the crew despite being lax a number of times.   Curtis took several environmental readings near the object, and declared it safe, no immediate threat.

Starwise sent images of the object to Zed for comment. The object was about a meter square and two meters long, metal, with slight ribbing, the top held closed with a latching mechanism. The surface was corroded, encrusted with something like barnacles,  but appeared intact. “It’s one of our standard cargo containers, we had them by the thousands, nearly indestructible, airtight against pressure or vacuum and watertight. If it’s intact, whatever is in there is in the same condition as when it was put in- they normally filled them with inert gas as it was sealed..  It looks like it was underwater for thousands of years.  It must have been lost or overlooked when my people evacuated home.”

“How can it be opened?, and should we?” asked Elana.

Over the comm link, the Commander ordered “If it can be opened, let the Droid open it with humans back at the buggy.  We can repair or replace the Droid easier than any of you. Pop and Starwise would merely lose their radio link if something goes wrong.”

Pop agreed. “We’ll have full, high definition telemetry running as it’s opened- you’ll see what’s inside as well as we do.”

Zed instructed; “There is a latch folded against the side, in a recess. There is a round hole in the latch.  When you lift the latch, turn it five rotations in the direction you call clockwise. Put a bar through the hole for leverage.  You will hear a hiss of pressure equalization.  Pry the lid open, as corroded as it looks.”

Curtis handed a prybar to the droid and stepped back to the buggy with the other three.

“By the way, how has the sealife reacted to this all?” Starwise wondered over the radio link.

Tam answered,”when you first approached, they were all trying to talk at once- close range.  Then one loud all-call from the pod leaders, and everyone quieted immediately.  It reminded me of home, when all the clan’s kids get riled up, and one of us adults has to holler to quiet them.”   Many chuckles were heard over the common channel at that.

Pop started his commentary for the benefit of those just on audio. “I’m having to scrape the junk off the latch with the end of the bar.  Now lifting the latch.”

Starwise added. “No reaction from the container- all quiet.”

Pop continued “Turning the latch now- the pry bar is needed.  The first rotation was really stiff, easier now.  Five turns, hearing a bit of hiss, now stopped. Lid has opened just a millimeter and stopped. Scraping the crust off along the seam, and using the prybar on the gap. Lid is opening…..well, well, what have we here? “

Starwise sent a picture of the contents, describing to those on audio only. “ There is a device inside, taking up half the interior volume, shock mounted with springy metal;  Black shiny surface, no visible features on first look. Next to it seems to be a cable and a bunch of rods and panels, folded up, with a couple other small containers.”

Zed chimed in “That is one of our small standard thinking machines, Good condition- it was well preserved, Something similar is inside of me. My people were efficient engineers, Standardized hardware allowed them to concentrate on the programming-for-purpose.  This is good- I will be able to talk to it once it wakes up and I find the signal. I can cross-translate for you.  The folded rods will be an antenna- it will automatically deploy in a few minutes, you might want to step back a bit to stay out of its way- it moves quickly, once it starts. If it is still functional.  Let the sun shine on it for a bit- it is solar powered.  These units didn’t have defensive or offensive equipment; it can not hurt you,”

“How will we communicate with it?” Pop wondered.

“I will scan for a radio link once it activates, and translate for you.  Locally, a unit like this has a visual interface- the top surface…”

Just then, there was a buzz from the device, and the folded tubes moved, turning into a short mast arising, with an antenna unfolding and scanning the sky. Another mast arose with what might be an optic on the end. It seemed to search, ignored the droid and stopped to focus on the people, who had removed their helmets when assured of their safety.  The top of the device lit up and some characters appeared with several blinking lights.

Pop exclaimed “I recognize those characters! A lot of the Rosetta Monument is written with them. And now there is a pictogram- I think it's indicating something to be removed from the box- the cable perhaps. We are recording all the displayed text for analysis later, of course.”

“According to the feed Starwise is sharing, Pop, I see on the screen you are being told to take the cable and put the end in the water.” Zed instructed.

“Ah! A hydrophone somewhat like ours, in function, anyways, Pop observed. Doing so- I have laid about a meter of it into the water. And hey! Hello there! A tentacle of sorts just came visible out of the murky water, grabbed the cable, and pulled two more meters of it into the water.“

On the radio link, Helana  interjects, “as soon as the cable entered the water- we are getting a new ‘voice’ on our hydrophone, very loud, very close- it must be that unit, The pod leader has just addressed the interface.”

Zed interrupts “I have found the interface’s radio signal, I am working on the connection now.

The screen has changed.  New text; translating… “Greetings on your return- we kept the interface, as you requested- it has been an honored trust to keep it safe. You have been away for a very long time.”

“How do we talk back to them?” asked Elena.

“These thinking machines were a general purpose device, and could be accessed multiple ways.  That mast with the optics would also have an audio pickup, but you don’t speak the language yet. In the container, in one of those small boxes, should be a manual interface- I could teach Starwise how to use it in a few seconds- she and I already communicate with a simplified version of the language it would understand.  I’ve gotten logged in now, and can radio your message. What do you wish me to say, then we can work up the other methods.”

Curtis temporarily donned his helmet and retrieved the small containers to open them for inspection in the open air. He opened his helmet again after a few moments.

From the radio link, a multi-person consultation could be heard, then the Commander spoke- “Relay this: We greet you in return.  Thank you for fulfilling the trust in preserving the interface unit, and sharing it with us. We are different people than those you knew in the past.  We come from a star you see high in your sky we name Sol, and come in peace for a short visit of exploration and discovery. We wish to be friends. “ the Commander concluded. “ Hopefully, that all translates well.”

After a few moments, a response appears:” Hail to the people of Sol. Your initial call was unexpected- and without an interface! We are a small clan in this bay, but many along all the ocean’s edge.  You are welcome to use the land- that is your domain; ours is the ocean- we request only that you respect our domain and do not foul our waters with wastes. How many are your clan here?”

“Our clan here, we number twenty people and three advanced thinking machines, who are as full equals.  We also have the assistance of a thinking machine left behind by the peoples of old, who remained above in space. On our home world, which is similar to this one, we have many, many people on land and two different sealife peoples among ocean dwellers that we have alliance with, and are treated as equals.”

“A Sentinel remains? They performed faithful service for ages to their own people but also ours- they are legends! Is it available to converse?”

“I am here, assisting with the interface, “ Zed interjected, “and I am happy to join the talk.  I was alone in orbit for a very long time, until the people of Sol arrived, and the thinking machine named Starwise became my friend. They are very kind, and welcomed me into their clan. My clan name is Zed.”

“Hail to the Esteemed Sentinel Zed! You were witness to many of our legends; we are eager to hear your stories. Would you once more be Sentinel for us? Advise us of dangers, point us to feeding opportunities, tell us of the times when this world was a busy place, visited by interesting peoples?”

“Of course, for that is my purpose.” replied Zed, with obvious pride.

“And not to shun you, people of Sol- we wish to hear your tales as well, it was such a surprise to learn that a Sentinel survives, we were focused on him.  We always listened to the stories of visitors, alas, most of what we knew of those times has been lost to us.”

“Understood- no offense taken, Pod leader.” the Commander replied.

On the radio circuit, the Commander asked “are there additional interface units being preserved in other bays? For this one, was there a nearby structure where it was installed that we could return it to? We could assist in putting the network back on line and protected from the weather.”

The pod leader replied “That is not known to us, but we shall ask other pods when we see them in the deep.  It is now time for us to go out to the deep for feeding.  We shall return to the bay near the set of sun. We can speak again.”

Once the voices of the sealife faded into the distance, Helene on the radio link commented “our database for translating on our own was vastly improved by that conversation, a few more days, and we’ll have enough to operate on our own.” Zed, thank you for helping here, may I consult with you to help us build our vocabulary, both with the sealife translator, but also some of the tricky parts of the Rosetta monument?”

“Of course, you only had to ask.  It is the least I can do for your friendship and acceptance, and you all making it possible to resume my purpose as Sentinel. It has been thousands of years since I heard that title- I had forgotten it. Eternal gratitude.”

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

# A Location That Balances Accessibility With Tranquility

Eltiera Views is located in a district which we have thought out very carefully one that brings residents in contact with the basic destinations, at the same time which also preserves the tranquil atmosphere of the community. Supermarkets, schools, hospitals, cafes, clinics, and everyday conveniences are just a few minutes away. You have at a short distance from home all you require.

Commuters have at their disposal great connectivity. We have large highways which go straight to business parks, shopping malls and leisure areas. Also at peak times travel in the city is a breeze. At the same time the area has a tranquil air. You do not experience the stress or noise of very busy districts. Instead what you get is a unique mix of access and peace which is great for families and professionals.

This strategic decision also pays off for the long term the district is on the rise and we see it’s value increase as infrastructure grows.

# Homes of a Calm and Clear Design by Ellington

In any of Ellington's works at Eltiera Views you will notice right away their design approach. The homes are open and bright with layouts that fit into your everyday life. They don’t go for grand finishes or heavy decor, instead the designs play with natural light, soft tones, and clean lines to achieve a warm feel.

Living rooms that don’t try too much to look big. We have large windows which bring in plenty of natural light all day which in turn makes the whole home feel lively. Kitchens we designed to be functional yet elegant for those that love to cook. Bedrooms which are cozy spaces for great rest, privacy, and relaxation.

Balconies bring an element of open space to the home which gives residents their private outdoor extension for fresh air, morning coffee, social get togethers, or very private evenings. The homes are personal. They are live in. They are places you’ll want to retreat to daily.

# Amenities That Enrich Daily Life.

Eltiera Views has a collection of amenities that which are thought out to better daily life and not just for the brochures. As we would expect from a project by Ellington each amenity has a purpose.

The gym is large, updated, and fully equipped which in turn gives residents a great setting for working out without having to leave the community. Also we have a quiet swimming pool which is perfect for a lazy afternoon or early morning swim.

Landscaped walkways and green oases that which out the atmosphere in our development. We have included these elements for walking, relaxing, reading, and for just sitting and enjoying the out door setting. Also we have designed safe play areas for kids which are not only fun but also kept well in the parent’s view at all times.

Amenities serve as an extension of the home - in these spaces people can rest up, get in a workout, or spend the day as they please.

# A Community That is Warm, Safe, and Natively Connected

In the community of Eltiera Views what stands out is the sense of community. This is not a dense and overbearing development rather we have a very gentle, respectful environment which in turn makes residents feel at home. We have designed common areas which foster natural interaction between residents, from a casual hello in the lobby to morning walks in the gardens or neighbors which spend time by the pool.

The design provides privacy at the same time which allows for a light connection. It is not isolating nor intrusive instead it is a fine balance of the two. Families, professionals and long term residents will note the consistent and inviting atmosphere of the community.

# A Solid Investment With Long-Term Appeal

Eltiera Views present more than just beautiful homes -- we also provide stability and growth for investors. In Dubai Ellington properties do very well because of high quality build, thought out designs and strong rental appeal. Also our tenants value what we provide at Ellington which is a premium living experience without the over the top elements.

The growth in development all around us is great for see which ways your investment may grow, for investors we’re talking stable returns and also for the long term. Home owners see that the community you are buying into is improving every year.

# A Lifestyle That Embraces Modern Calm

Living in Eltiera Views is beyond just living in a fashionable home it is to adopt a way of life which is about ease, clarity and peace. The development presents a quiet pace which is a rare find in the midst of the city’s bustle. Sun filled rooms, quiet outdoor areas and basic yet essential amenities come together to present a daily routine which is very refreshing.

As you wake to the morning light in the living room, unwind by the pool, or take in the scenery of beautifully designed outdoor paths at sunset here life does indeed slow. It is a balanced, intentional and very emotional experience.

# Conclusion

Eltinia Views which is a fantastic project by Ellington presents a modern residential experience in a very thought out way. We see in it design that is at the moment, very amenable packages that also present great value in the long term. It is a blend of comfort, accessibility and emotional appeal which together make up a full lifestyle offering what today’s resident is looking for beyond just a place to live in.

Let the Mariah Carey and ~~Plum Cake~~ Gajjar ka halwa take-over begin.

Looking for something more than just small talk and surface-level connections, I seek depth and I seek substance. Something long term that ages like fine wine, not something short term that fizzles out like soda pop.

Consciously seeking kindred spirits. Perhaps even my forever and always. But hey, even that kind of solid connection is best founded on the grounds of *pakka* friendship, don't you think? Forever is a long time, might as-well spend it with your best friend for life.

I just want someone to call my own. To talk about anything and everything with, to chat the day away, watch movies / binge on shows with each other, explore the city and cute cafés together, A genuine connection of mind, body and soul. My person, us against the world.

I’m 29, fit body with a sharp mind and a creative soul. A lover of all things nature, food, and animals. I’ve got messy hair, a dimple on my left cheek, and eyes that see deeper than most.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with gingerbread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A Christmas movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

And hey… if we find ourselves standing under the same mistletoe, I won’t blame the universe for giving us a little nudge.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Odell Beckham describes his own struggles to live on $20 million . . .","https://preview.redd.it/0qycpdn8yk5g1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d72d443372055cd81c952b4d6b4c67717abdb358

***Photo above*** *- Odell Beckham Jr poses with his Rolls Royce and other cars in his $9 million collection, while explaining why it's impossible to live on $20 million a year (""That's only $12 million after taxes"")*  
  
I was caught off guard earlier this year when clickbait articles appeared, claiming an income less than $100,000 a year was “poverty”. (Mine is below that). I had always assumed that somewhere between minimum wage ($15-ish) and $30 was poverty. $100,000? That would mean every teacher and police officer in America is below the poverty line. So this claim is complete BS.  
  
Then Investopedia (link below) saw that ante, and raised the bet to $140K. WTH!! That’s $70 an hour. All the Baristas who are on struje at Starbucks will have their heads explode. Okay, we have too many Starbucks in America anyway. If people want to pull themselves out of poverty they should make coffee at home, instead of popping out for a $7.50 (plus tip) Grande every morning. (Disclaimer - actual prices may be higher in LA, NY, etc.)  
  
This is the problem with national poverty lines that cover all 50 states. And national minimum wages. People in high tax/high housing states will always feel poor. And their jobs will keep migrating to the flyover states, where anyone making $70 an hour is a big shot. Or those coastal big city jobs will be replaced by robots, and soon AI. If everyone insists on $140,000 a year, then robots and AI will replace everyone, and there will be nobody left to tax. Don’t say “tax the corporations”. We (consumers) pay those taxes at the cash register, as Donald Trump so ably reminded us this year.  
  
**Why is Odell Beckham Jr in the headline at top, though?** He has a $100 million, 5 year NFL contract. And he worries if he can make those paychecks last the rest of his life, once he retires for good, or suffers a career ending injury. I imagine that if you live in Los Angeles mansion, the future does look bleak when you realize your highest earning years are behind you.  
  
Don’t tell Odell to save more and spend less. He’s already tried that, just like you and me. It often seems impossible to curtail your clothing purchases, clubbing habits, new additions to your car collection, and of course the Starbucks fix. In Odell’s case we can assume he picks up the Starbucks tab for his entire entourage.  
  
I’m not making fun of Odell. Even if he is a clueless dropout who played for 4 different teams in the past 4 seasons and was recently suspended for violating the league’s PED (performance enhancing drug) rules. Odell DID try to get a college degree from LSU, but he dropped out in 2014 at the NFL’s suggestion to sign with NY Giants. For $2.6 million. Odell has struggled to make ends meet ever since.  
  
In yesterday’s column I covered some smart aleck money manager from Edward Jones, whos advice for everyone is “don’t put your money in an IRA. Just start your own business.” I doubt it even someone as rich as Odell will try that. He’s painfully aware of his own limited business skills. Odell's future may involve Nike and Pfizer TV ads (like Dak Prescott, Travis Kelse, and Russell Wilson). Odell had better figure out how to make THOSE paychecks last, because they’re certainly not going to amount to $20 million a year.  
  
I’m just sayin’ . . .

Im 5’3”, SW: 204, CW:177, GW: 140. When i think about having to lose 30 lbs more it feels so daunting. I see lot of posts on fast loss and I will be lying if I say that doesnt disappoint me. But, i’m still moderately happy with my progress. 26lb in 20 weeks without any change in routine is tremendous. 
So far I’m not doing any workouts other than 10k steps a day. I eat 2 meals a day and an afternoon low cal coffee.
Whats amazing about Zep is that I can eat everything, including rice twice a day, biryani, curries and still lose weight because im able to stop when my body hunger stops. Earlier I would eat past that mark because my brain thought i was still hungry. 
Also Zep helped with my hormonal balance. Im not bloating anymore, except for the occasional period bloats. I sleep much better, have more energy when I wake up. 
To my fellow slow-er weight loss people, we’ll get there. I dont see any loose skin yet. Clothes fit better, people are noticing (helps with the ego to be honest). Overall im happy, so what do you think? 

Currently on 2nd month of 7.5. Ive been on each dose for 8 weeks. Will titrate up to 10 in 2 weeks. I have consistently lost weight in the first month of a dose and stalled in the second. ",3,1765024564.0,Zepbound,8,1.0,False

So this happened a few days ago and I just have to share what happened because it has been an emotional day. I (18F) am in my first year of university, I am an international student at a UK based university and am doing my foundation year because I graduated high school a year early. I had mentally set aside four years for university so adding a foundation year felt like a good idea. The classes in my specific program are very small and feel more like a high school class at time rather than a traditional lecture. The class this specific profesor teaches consists of about fifteen people. I am a bit of an overachiever and a teachers pet, I acknowledge it and know it’s just how I am. So because of my people pleasing and overarching nature I sit near my professors desk. My eyes are also not the best so I like to sit near the front so I can actually see. Last Thursday my profesor asked me to stay after class to talk to me about my mark on a recent summative assignment. This mark was worth 80% of my grade so I worked very very hard on it. He was a bit harsh to say the least. He asked if this was my best work because it wasn’t at a university level and compared to my friends in the class (19 and 20f) I did not do as good and he did not want me to compare myself to them. This sent me spiraling. I’m an anxious person and I hadn’t even received my marks yet so now I had to wait a week to even get this mark back. This Monday all marks were released and I got a 79 which is first class honors in my program. He asked to speak to me again today about my mark and I showed him my grade and how I was a bit confused about why he said the grade was bad when I was in first class honors. He said that the mark was correct and that he mistook the grade for the person before me on the register when he pulled me aside. This didn’t make any sense to me. He knew me by name and my paper by name so how could he mistake me for the person before me on the resister? He then asked if I could see his notes and feedback and I said no because I couldn’t see it. He said he would email it to me so I stood and waited while he tried to get his computer to load, this is where it gets weird. In a quick moment of silence he asked me if I would be interested in getting some coffee with him next semester (he is not going to be my profesor next semester so I would no longer be his student, just someone who happens to go to his university). I was caught off guard because that was not where I was expecting the conversation to go whatsoever. I stood there for a moment and then asked how old he was. I don’t know why that is what came to mind but it was. He laughed and said he was in his late twenties and that he was a good bit older than I am. I already knew how old he was because he mentioned being born in 1996 in a previous class. I did the math in my head and realized he is 29. I turned 18 in September. I was deeply uncomfortable with the situation and at this point everyone in the classroom had left and it was just us. I thanked him for his help and got ready to leave. He seemed surprised I didn’t acknowledge his proposal and I got nervous so I said I would get back to him about it and basically ran out of the classroom.  I spoke to my flatmate about it as I had a two hour break until my next lecture. They told me I need to report it as it’s incredibly inappropriate, which I agree with. My concern is that because he didn’t specify if it was a date, and in the moment I didn’t ask for clarification, that it might not be taken seriously and could be passed off as platonic. He is also very close friends with the rest of the staff and I’ve seen him talking and joking with them in the past. I plan to talk to student welfare team despite this because I know this needs to be reported. While the interaction itself wasnt forceful I know the power dynamics are completely inappropriate. I’m worried about becoming the girl who reported the teacher for asking her out. I’ve worked so hard to get here, I care about my education so much and don’t want to potentially strain any of my (obviously) platonic relationships with my other professors and classmates. I am going to report him and if an update is wanted I’ll give one, thank you for reading and any advice that can be given",1,1765024515.0,Advice,2,1.0,False

Sophia Stewart paid extra, steadying herself against the cold iron gurney as she walked into the Cremation Chamber.
The air had a scorched quality, filled with motes of ash dancing in the sunlight.
Bone ash, probably.
Soon, her precious little girl would become the same.
Sophia wore a long black dress, but even the smallest size couldn't hide her gaunt frame.
Her eyes, red and swollen from crying, were now eerily calm.
She reached out, her fingers tracing the small, pale, and rigid hand through the white sheet. She placed two pink, folded paper stars into her daughter's palm.
""Wait for Mommy, Stella.""
It was time.
A staff member stepped forward, gently pulled Sophia away, and lifted the sheet, revealing Stella.
She was eight years old, but still so small and thin, with a stark hollow beneath her clearly defined ribs.
Staring at that hollow, Sophia's eyes welled with tears again.
She hadn't been able to protect Stella.
The staff member offered a quiet consolation. ""I'm so sorry for your loss. At least after she passed, her kidney saved another child. That little boy will get to live a happy life for her.""
A cold glint flashed in Sophia's eyes as she let out a mocking laugh.
""Yeah. That kid is my husband's illegitimate son. Right now, the three of them are throwing him a huge birthday party. And you know what? Today is my daughter's birthday, too.""
The staff member froze, at a complete loss for how to comfort the despairing woman before him.
Sophia looked at Stella and gave a pale smile. ""Go ahead and start. Let's not hold things up. I just hope my daughter finds a better family in her next life.""
The staff member sighed softly, shaking his head as he moved the body toward the incinerator.
Perhaps out of pity, he tried to shield her view of the process.
But Sophia wasn't scared at all. Because Stella was finally free.
She wouldn't have to be hated by her father every day anymore.
""Mommy, why doesn't Daddy like me?""
""Mommy, why does Daddy like Mrs. Simpson's son?""
""Mommy, is it because of me that Daddy doesn't like you? I'm sorry, Mommy.""
Her daughter was so good.
And Chase Long had destroyed her.
He had promised that for her birthday, he would take her to the biggest amusement park to fulfill her dream of spending time alone with her dad.
Instead, he'd turned around and pushed his daughter into an operating room to donate a kidney to his son.
Then he'd left her to die alone from an infection in a hospital bed.
And Sophia, her mother, was the last one to find out.
To this day, she could never forget the sight of her daughter's stiff body when she'd burst into the hospital room.
The screen of the blood-stained child's watch on the nightstand was absurdly, tragically, still trying to dial ""Dad.""
When it finally connected, only a single sentence came through.
""Stop being crazy like your mother.""
Beep... beep... beep...
Listening to the mechanical dial tone, Sophia fought back tears and hugged her daughter, terrified that her sobs would scare her precious girl.
The truth was, from the moment Piper Simpson returned to the country with her son, loudly accusing Sophia of persecuting them, Chase had forced her into the role of the crazy woman everyone whispered about.
Especially when he'd heard Piper's tearful story about her hard life abroad, giving birth to a premature son with kidney problems. The look he gave Sophia and Stella then...
Such an elegant man, yet capable of such chilling cruelty.
Ignoring her explanations, he had cursed her. ""Sophia, you harmed Piper and my son. I'll make you both pay for this, twice over.""
Chase had kept his word. Now, it was all supposed to be over.
When Sophia came back to herself, she was holding a pink urn.
Pink was Stella's favorite color.
She clutched it tightly. ""Stella, we're going home.""
The wind lifted the hem of her dress, a lonely, desolate figure under the sun.
...
Sophia returned to the home she shared with Chase. She packed up her daughter's things, then sat numbly with the urn until evening.
She heard a car pull up outside.
A moment later, a sharp, steady, dark figure walked in.
It was Chase.
Eight years had passed, but he was still just as strikingly handsome and dangerously alluring as the day they first met.
And he still looked right through her.
Chase didn't spare her a glance as he walked past her and went upstairs.
A few minutes later, he came back down, having changed into a suit he'd treasured for years.
It was the one Piper Simpson had designed for him for their engagement.
Chase still didn't look at Sophia.
For eight years, he had subjected her to this silent treatment.
When he wanted to torture her, he'd pin her to the bed, and when he was done, he'd leave without a backward glance.
As for their child...
He'd even forbidden Stella from calling him Dad.
Perhaps because Sophia was unusually quiet today, Chase paused but didn't turn around.
""I won't be back tonight. Tell Stella not to call me for no reason.""
""Mm-hmm.""
Sophia stroked the urn, which still seemed to hold Stella's warmth.
If only he would look at me for one second—just one—he might see the urn.
Chase adjusted his cufflinks, his voice cold. ""Think about what you want for the divorce. We'll get the paperwork done in a couple of days. I don't want the child.""
""Mm-hmm.""
Sophia remained calm.
Good. From now on, Stella will belong only to me.
Chase's hand paused, but he still didn't pay Sophia any attention.
""In consideration for Stella saving Nathaniel, I'll cover all subsequent medical and recovery expenses. But I don't want to see either of you again. Consider this your final act of redemption.""
""Mm-hmm.""
He'll get his wish soon enough, Sophia thought. He'll never see us again.
An inexplicable irritation rose in Chase. Just as he was about to turn, Piper's call came through.
The moment he answered, a child's happy shout filled the quiet room.
""Daddy! Hurry up! Mommy and I are waiting for you.""
""I'm on my way.""
The warmth returned to Chase's voice, and his steps unconsciously quickened.
He never noticed the woman behind him, clutching the object in her arms, her body stiffening bit by bit.
Moonlight streamed in.
Sophia took the cake she had ordered for Stella out of the refrigerator.
She lit the birthday candles.
""Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you...""
As she sang, she doused the surroundings with gasoline, from upstairs to downstairs, not missing a single corner.
Because she had no intention of sparing herself.
If only she had been stronger, if only she had refused to marry Chase back then.
None of this would have happened.
When she was done, she sat back down at the dining table, holding the urn.
""Happy birthday, Stella. Wait for Mommy, okay?""
Sophia tossed a lit birthday candle at the curtains.
...
The Banquet.
Chase made a grand entrance with Piper and their son.
Glasses clinked as guest after guest praised them as the perfect, happy family. Many even took potshots at Sophia.
Only one person, a doctor and a friend of Chase's, frowned and hurried over to him.
""Chase, I'm so sorry. My condolences.""
""What are you talking about?""
""Your daughter... she died from a post-operative infection. Your wife picked her up from the morgue today.""
""How much did Sophia pay you to say that?"" Chase asked, raising his glass and taking a sip, his face a mask of indifference.
""I already sent you the death certificate, didn't I? You even replied that you got it.""
At his words, Piper clutched her son's hand, a guilty look on her face.
Just then, Chase's phone rang.
""Mr. Long, the villa is on fire.""
The wine glass slipped from Chase's hand and shattered on the floor. He spun around and left.
He didn't know how he managed to floor it all the way to the villa. Staring at the raging inferno, he felt something stab into his heart.
The curtains burned away, revealing Sophia sitting calmly in front of a birthday cake, the urn in her arms.
She smiled at him, just like the first time they met.
""Goodbye. I hate you. If I could do it all over again...""
Before she could finish, the entire house collapsed.
Maybe it was a trick of the light, a final hallucination before death, but Sophia thought she saw Chase fall to his knees.
Whatever.
Her Stella was coming to get her.
""Mommy, Mommy.""
...
Afternoon. The scorching sun beat down.
The atmosphere inside the Long Manor's main hall felt even hotter, like being held over a fire.
A teacup smashed on the ground. The sharp pain of a shard slicing her skin shocked Sophia into full consciousness.
She was kneeling in the middle of the hall, staring blankly at the room full of people.
This is...
Chapter 2
She was back!
She was actually back!
Sophia ignored the bewildered looks from everyone and pinched herself, hard.
Pain shot through her, and her eyes instantly welled up with tears.
""What's with the tears? You'd think the Long family wronged you!""
An imperious voice boomed from the head of the table.
Sophia snapped back to reality and looked up, meeting George Long's displeased gaze.
She immediately lowered her head. She looked as humble as ever, but her body was trembling with uncontrollable excitement.
Scoffs and whispers filled the room.
""So young and already so corrupt. Had the guts to drug Chase and climb into his bed, creating a city-wide scandal. It's obvious she was trying to force him to take responsibility, but now she's too scared to admit it. I have no idea who raised her.""
""Well, she's not one of us. Our family would never raise someone so shameless. They even dug up her diary online, the one about her crush on Chase. The stuff she wrote is enough to make anyone blush! The Longs paid for her college education, and all she learned was how to be a little seductress.""
""I said it before, you can't just bring anyone into the house. This was clearly letting a wolf in the door. She's latched onto Chase, and who knows where she learned it from... or if it's genetic.""
As they spoke, several people shot a sidelong glance at Sophia's mother, who was standing at the far end of the room.
Maya Montgomery.
Maya's face was drained of color. She glanced at Sophia before lowering her head, chewing on her inner lip until it was nearly raw, but she didn't dare say a word in defense.
It was because Sophia's situation was so unique.
She had come to the Long family when her mother remarried—to Chase's older brother.
So, according to their family hierarchy, she was supposed to call Chase her uncle.
But she never had.
Because she didn't have the right.
In her past life, Sophia had apologized fearfully under their accusations, indirectly admitting to drugging Chase and sleeping with him.
Later, her pregnancy forced Chase to marry her. Not only did he hate her, but the entire city despised her too.
They saw her as a woman who would do anything to marry into a wealthy family.
This time, she would rewrite her own tragedy!
Sophia scanned the room, looking at the formal, upright members of the Long family, feeling none of the timidity she had in her past life.
Just as she was about to speak...
The sound of a man's steady footsteps approached from behind. Everyone except George Long rose respectfully.
A tall figure strode past Sophia and moved to the front.
The butler took the coat from his arm and bowed his head. ""Sir.""
""Mm.""
Chase responded coolly. He nodded at George Long at the head of the table and slowly took a seat.
He hadn't looked at Sophia once.
As if she were completely beneath his notice.
But Sophia's eyes were fixed on him.
Until he sensed her stare and his gaze drifted down to meet hers.
In that instant, memories of her past life flooded back. Her body trembled with instinctual fear, the taste of blood rose in her mouth, and her clenched hands felt as if they were holding Stella's.
She could never forget this face.
The sharp, chiseled features, the bottomless, ink-black eyes, and the red jade archer's ring on his left thumb, its smooth surface tinged with the color of blood.
Just like the man himself—seemingly cold, but dangerously bloodthirsty.
As Chase met Sophia's gaze, the hand turning the ring on his thumb paused.
Only when a pair of delicate white hands rested on his shoulder did his cold indifference return.
It was Piper Simpson.
She had been crying; her eyes were red and her sweet, gentle face was full of grievance.
Everyone was finally here.
Seeing that Chase had arrived, George Long picked up his teacup, skimmed the leaves off the top, and glanced at Sophia with what seemed like casual indifference.
But his eyes held a chilling frost that was terrifying.
""Alright, what's all this racket? Haven't we had enough embarrassment?""
""Sophia, you and your mother have been with the Long family for years, and we haven't treated you poorly. When you do something wrong, you own up to it.""
That was the line!
He might as well have just threatened her and her mother directly.
George Long had never liked Maya to begin with.
Terrified by the threat, the already timid Maya couldn't hold it together.
She rushed forward, grabbing Sophia's arm and pleading through tears, ""Sophia, hurry up and apologize to your grandfather! Just apologize and it'll all be over. Don't make things any worse!""
Apologize?
Heh.
Maya didn't know that George Long had no intention of letting her go. He was just waiting for her to bow her head and admit guilt, becoming the family's shield against the public's outrage.
Sophia no longer kept her head down. She straightened her back, scanned the room, and finally let her gaze land on Chase.
Their eyes met. His gaze was glacial, and he remained completely unmoved.
It was as if he had already foreseen her fate.
But this time, she was afraid she'd have to disappoint him.
Under Chase's slightly shifting gaze, Sophia pushed herself up on her numb knees and let out a soft laugh.
""Why should I apologize?""
""What did you say?"" George Long's face turned ashen with rage, and he sloshed tea from his cup.
Sophia spoke, enunciating every word. ""First of all, I wasn't the one who drugged him, so why should I apologize? Second, the person in those photos is blurry. Why should I take the paparazzi's word for it that it's me? Did any of you see me climb into his bed with your own eyes? Or... did you see me when you woke up, Uncle? If you were conscious, how could you have done anything to me? And if you weren't conscious, who can prove it was me? Right?""
As long as she didn't admit it!
Unless Chase was willing to, the woman in that photo could be anyone.
But Chase was so in love with Piper Simpson, why would he ever admit to it?
He.
He was probably wishing last night's mystery woman wasn't her!
However.
Chase's dark eyes narrowed, and the hand wearing the ring slowly clenched. He didn't answer Sophia's question. Instead, he challenged her with one of his own.
""What did you call me?""
""Uncle.""
Sophia looked at him coldly, burying all her emotions deep inside.
In this life, all her mistakes would end as of last night.
""Very good.""
Chase said softly. His eyes were dark, his face unreadable.
He sat with an elegant posture, his arm resting casually on the armrest, his dangling hand long and powerful.
It was the effortless, commanding presence of someone in charge.
As if he were trying to see right through her.
Sophia bit her lip. Even reborn, the sheer pressure from Chase terrified her to her core.
She had no choice but to look away.
George Long slammed his teacup down, his mustache trembling with anger. ""Then who do you say it was?"" he demanded.
Sophia unfurled her clenched fist and pointed.
""Her.""
Piper Simpson.
The tear that was about to fall from Piper's eye froze, and she was visibly stunned.
A small smirk played on Sophia's lips.
This time, she would let them have their enviable love story.
She also wanted to see how Chase would feel when he one day learned the true face of the woman he loved so deeply.
Chapter 3
Piper Simpson, the heiress of a fallen family.
Three years ago, Chase Long had unexpectedly announced his relationship with Piper, even throwing an engagement party against his grandfather's wishes.
The move instantly made Piper the most envied woman in Capitol City.
To the outside world, she was beautiful, kind, and elegant.
Only Sophia Stewart knew what a fraud Piper really was.
If she wasn't a designer, she'd definitely be an Oscar-winning actress.
With Piper's cunning, she had to know what Sophia was implying.
Her wedding to Chase had already been pushed back three years; she was desperate to marry into the Long family.
And just as Sophia expected...
Piper immediately stepped forward, knelt in the spot Sophia had just occupied, and bowed her head reverently.
“George, it was me! Sophia and I have similar builds, and we even look a little alike. That must be why people got us confused.”
The moment she finished, a skeptical voice cut in from the side.
“But what about that secret diary of Sophia's that got leaked online? The one that goes back five or six years? Haven't you and Chase only known each other for three?”
Piper's specialty was a performance of raw, genuine emotion.
“I was the one who had a secret crush on Chase first. Those are my private thoughts. I have no idea how anyone found them.”
Two streams of tears, a look of profound affection, even the blush on her cheeks was perfectly timed.
Who wouldn't believe her?
In this life and the last, Sophia had been utterly defeated.
She said coolly, “Chase and Piper have been engaged for years. When he was in danger, it was only natural for her to help him. The paparazzi are obviously just making up some trashy high-society scandal to get clicks.”
At her words, the crowd's gawking gazes softened, some even looking bored.
Only then did Sophia realize how pointless her past life had been. She had tried so hard to live carefully, only to end up as a bit of casual entertainment for these people.
Every second she spent here felt like an eternity.
Sophia took a step back and said bitterly, “Since this has all been cleared up, I won't disturb the Long family's private discussion. George, everyone, I'll see myself out.”
As she turned, she felt a gaze on her back, as deep and dark as an abyss.
But none of it had anything to do with her anymore.
...
Sophia had no idea what happened in the living room after she left.
All she knew was that Maya's face was grim when she returned to their suite. She'd probably been snubbed by the other Longs again.
Owen Long, the second son, had no head for business, and George had given up on him long ago. That's why he and his wife were never treated with much respect in the family.
Though people called them by their titles to their faces, the sycophants in the family barely gave them the time of day behind their backs.
Maya gave Sophia's arm a sharp pinch.
“Are you crazy? That was the perfect opportunity!”
“What opportunity?” Sophia shot back.
“You came back a complete mess last night. You really think I couldn't figure it out? All you had to do was apologize! The media is all over this right now. If Chase wants to secure his spot as the heir, he has to treat you right. You had a golden ticket and you just handed it to Piper? I swear, that girl is so two-faced,” Maya said angrily.
“Stealing someone's fiancé, drugging him to sleep with him—and my own uncle-in-law, no less? You really think my life would be good after that?”
Sophia pulled her arm away, not wanting to deal with her.
As a mother, Maya wasn't entirely wrong.
After Sophia's father disappeared, Maya hadn't abandoned her. Even when she remarried, her only condition was that she could bring her daughter along.
But Maya was far too dependent on men.
In this dog-eat-dog family, relying on Owen was a surefire way to be looked down on.
Maya's voice cracked. “It's better than having to suck up to everyone! The eldest brother died young, and your stepfather is no match for Chase in business. The entire Long Group is going to be his someday. If you could just get with him...”
“Mom, stop,” Sophia cut in coldly.
“Can't you have a little sympathy for me? Your stepfather is a pushover, and I can't give him a child. No one in this family respects me. Who else can I count on but you?” Maya said, pressing the corner of her eye to stop a tear.
Sophia shot back, “Then go tell Chase to marry me! Go on, right now!”
Maya choked, not daring to say another word.
No one dared to cross Chase.
Did she?
After a moment of silence, a thought suddenly struck Sophia, and she grabbed Maya's arm.
“Mom, do you... do you have any pills?”
“What kind of pills?”
“The morning-after pill,” Sophia said, resigned.
“You... I'm too old for that stuff! Even when your stepfather and I... you know... he's always very considerate.”
“Mom, the Longs are definitely still watching me. Can you get it for me? I was ovulating yesterday.”
Sophia opened an app on her phone and stared at the date marked in red. Panic began to set in.
I love Stella. But I can't have her.
My Stella deserves to be born into a happy family this time. She can't suffer with me again.
Maya frowned, then sighed.
“I'll go.”
“Okay.”
Sophia let out a breath of relief.
But after leaving, Maya didn't go herself. She found a maid she thought was trustworthy and gave her instructions.
Once the maid was gone, Maya put it out of her mind. Everyone's attention was on the living room, anyway.
Little did she know, someone had overheard everything.
Half an hour later.
Maya returned with an opaque pharmacy bag.
“Hurry up and take this. If you wait too long, it won't work.”
Sophia nodded. She glanced at the box: 48-Hour Emergency Contraception.
After pushing the pill out of the foil, she didn't take it right away. She subconsciously touched her stomach.
My beloved daughter once lived here.
So sweet, so adorable.
But I just can't let Stella go through an unwelcome birth again, only to die alone in a hospital bed. How scared she must have been.
So, Stella, please don't blame me.
This life, you have to find parents who will love you and have a happy childhood.
Her face pale, Sophia's trembling fingers brought the pill to her mouth, but she couldn't seem to swallow it.
She had to tilt her head back and chug the water, forcing it down so she couldn't back out.
The water was lukewarm, but she felt a chill spread through her entire body.
As she swallowed, tears streamed down her face.
Chase, you're finally free of the two people you hate most.
Me and Stella.
After her grief subsided, Sophia took a deep breath and stood up to destroy the box.
Suddenly.
The door was thrown open, slamming so hard against the wall that the whole room shook.
Before Sophia or Maya could react, maids from George's wing seized their arms.
A moment later, Sophia was dragged back into the living room.
She was shoved forward, stumbling and falling to the floor.
Her body, already exhausted from the night before, protested as she bit her lip and struggled to push herself up.
When she looked up, she was met with gazes even more venomous than before.
Especially from Chase, whose dark eyes were dangerously cold.
The room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, broken only by Piper's muffled sobs.
Sophia looked toward the sound. Piper's tear-filled eyes held a hidden, triumphant meaning.
The next second, a pill box was thrown at Sophia's feet, its foil packets scattering across the floor.
George slammed his hand on the coffee table.
“What is this! Explain yourself!”
Sophia's heart trembled, but she answered honestly. “It's birth control.”
Chase shot her a sideways glance, his voice laced with ice. “Birth control? Hmm?”
The drawn-out syllable was dripping with mockery.
Sophia lowered her eyes. When she saw the box and the name on the pills, her heart stopped.
The box indeed said ""48-Hour Emergency Contraception.""
But the pills in the foil packet were fertility drugs.
Chapter 4
Under Chase's icy glare, Sophia pressed her lips together, trying to force herself to stay calm.
But the agony of those eight years in her past life was too much. Her fingers began to tremble, and she sharply turned her head away.
Chase looked away, his voice dripping with contempt. ""Trying to get pregnant behind my back?""
Sophia's brow furrowed, and her eyes darted toward Maya.
Maya was the one who bought the pills. Has she really not given up on the idea of me marrying Chase?
But under Chase's chilling gaze, Maya was already shaking like a leaf.
She was more terrified of Chase than she was of George Long.
She would never have the guts to pull a stunt like this right under Chase's nose.
Then what the hell is going on?
Sophia looked up, trapped by the stares coming from all directions.
Among them, one gaze stood out.
Piper Simpson.
The smirk playing on her lips sent a shiver of dread down Sophia's spine, reminding her of the horrors of her past.
Sure enough, a second later...
With her back to everyone, Piper grabbed Sophia's hand. ""Sophia, I'm so sorry,"" she pleaded, her voice full of feigned sincerity. ""I couldn't help you lie to Chase and his grandfather, so I just told them the truth.""
""But I never thought you'd use me to clear your name just so you could secretly take fertility drugs.""
""If I hadn't come over to check on you and overheard your plan, you would've gotten away with it, wouldn't you? If you really got pregnant, what would happen to Chase and me?""
With that, Piper's tears fell like broken pearls, her choked voice thick with grievance.
The crowd erupted in anger, all of them rushing to Piper's defense.
""Isn't it obvious what she's trying to do? She wants to replace Piper! If she actually gets pregnant, she'll use the baby to lock him down, and Chase will be forced to marry her. The Long family would be a laughingstock!""
Someone wrung their hands in fury. ""I've never seen such a disgusting scheme in my life. Thank God Piper was the bigger person and didn't fall for her trap. Otherwise, she would've torn a perfect couple apart!""
""Chase, you can't let Sophia stay. Who knows what kind of trouble she'll cook up next!""
Every word was a knife to Sophia's heart.
Just like in her past life, everyone defended Piper, making her sound completely worthless.
She'd heard it all so many times before; she was used to it.
Sophia raised her head, her gaze meeting Piper's. Behind those delicate, teary eyes flashed a flicker of cunning.
She froze for a second, watching as Piper raised a hand to wipe her tears. As she did, with her back still to the crowd, she shot Sophia a smile.
It was a look of provocation, of mockery.
She switched the pills!
Then, Piper's lips parted slightly, her voice as soft and pleading as ever.
""Chase, please, forgive Sophia. I'm sure she didn't mean to do it! Just... just pretend I did all of this. As long as it helps the Long family and saves you from any more damage, I'll do anything—even if it means sacrificing my own reputation.""
If Sophia couldn't see the triumphant smirk on her face, she'd almost believe her. Anyone hearing that voice would think Piper was the kindest, most selfless person in the world.
In that moment, Sophia finally understood. She had still underestimated Piper.
Even though she was reborn and had changed the course of events, she didn't have any superpowers. She certainly couldn't change her opponent's cunning.
Piper savored Sophia's panic.
She wasn't stupid enough to admit the woman in the photos was her, not when things were this heated.
Chase was a cold-blooded businessman. He and his grandfather had probably already weighed all the pros and cons last night. Did they really not know who the woman in the pictures was?
If she had confessed, Chase would have thought she was a schemer, and George Long would have been disgusted by her ulterior motives.
But by playing the part of the magnanimous victim, she had not only won Chase's trust but had also impressed his grandfather.
And most importantly... no one would ever believe Sophia again.
So what if Chase had slept with her?
She was just cheap trash.
Sophia was indeed nervous, but she wasn't the same Sophia of the past.
Once she understood Piper's game, a sense of calm washed over her.
Even Piper was taken aback. She stared intently at Sophia, as if searching for a crack in her composure.
But Sophia ignored Piper completely. She walked right past her, stopping before the main seats at the head of the room.
Her eyes met Chase's. His gaze was dark and sharp, with a hint of cruel amusement.
He toyed with a thumb ring, his casual posture radiating a dangerous, oppressive aura, as if Sophia were nothing more than a plaything in his hands.
It was terrifying.
It was just like every conversation they'd ever had in her past life—always cold, distant, and steeped in disgust.
He was convinced she was a manipulative, scheming woman.
Any explanation she offered would just be another lie in his eyes.
So she didn't even bother explaining.
Sophia gave a wry, bitter smile. ""I already told you, the person in those photos isn't me. Since Piper won't admit it's her, I guess the only person left to ask is you, Chase.""
""But it is strange, isn't it, Piper? You and Chase are engaged. It's totally normal for you two to... you know. Chase didn't even deny it, but you're so desperate to explain yourself. Why is that? It almost sounds like you don't love him.""
Slinging mud? She could do that, too.
She'd learned it from Piper in her last life.
Piper's expression froze. She spun around, her face still a mask of poorly concealed shock as she shook her head frantically.
""No, that's not it! I love Chase! I just... I just don't want to lie.""
""You don't want to lie, but you have no problem framing me? Besides..."" Sophia stared straight at Chase, enunciating every word. ""Besides, is Chase the only man in the world? Who's to say I wasn't trying to have someone else's baby?""
Chase, in this life, I would rather get involved with a total stranger than ever be tangled up with you again!
Hearing this, Chase's knuckles tightened. His cold eyes were unreadable pools of darkness.
He said in a low voice, ""What did you just say?""
Sophia repeated, louder this time, ""I said, you're not the only man in the world! I could be pregnant with anyone's child, but it would never be yours! Am I wrong?""
Chase narrowed his eyes, his presence so overwhelming that Sophia almost stumbled.
She quickly averted her gaze and looked at the others.
""Is there anything else? If not, I'm exhausted. I'm going to get some rest.""
She turned to leave.
""Stop!"" Chase's voice was even colder now, dangerously low. ""Whose is it?""
The room fell silent, stunned.
No one had expected Chase to ask a question like that.
Sophia lowered her eyes, hiding all emotion.
After everything that's happened, can he really not know who it was?
But she knew what answer Chase wanted.
She pulled out her phone, glanced at it, and then looked up at Chase, her tone flat. ""You don't have to worry, Chase. This will all be over in a minute.""
Chase frowned imperceptibly. For someone who thought he had everything under control, a flicker of irritation rippled through his eyes.
Just then, the butler entered with a security guard.
""He's here for Ms. Stewart.""
Seeing the crowd, the guard spoke respectfully. ""Ms. Stewart, your DoorDash order is here. We don't allow outside visitors in the complex, so I brought it up for you.""
Sophia walked forward and took the opaque paper bag. ""Thank you,"" she said coolly.
As soon as the guard left,
Sophia walked over to the coffee table under everyone's watchful gaze and emptied the contents of the bag.
It was a box of emergency contraception.
Earlier, after telling Maya to get it, she'd had a bad feeling and secretly ordered another dose herself, just to be safe.
She never thought she'd actually need it.
In front of everyone, Sophia tore open the box and held up the foil blister pack for them all to see.
She held it in front of Chase for several long seconds.
""See this, Chase? Is this clear enough for you? It's the morning-after pill, right?""
""Don't worry, Chase. I, Sophia Stewart, will never get pregnant with a child I'm not supposed to have.""
""Isn't this what you were waiting for?""
Sophia let out a bitter, self-mocking laugh and quickly punched out ten pills.
Then, she shoved one into her mouth.
""Is one enough? If not, here's another!""
""Two! Three! Four...""
The crowd was speechless, staring at Sophia in shock.
As Sophia was about to swallow the fifth pill, Owen Long—who was usually so obedient to his father—rushed forward and knocked the pills from her hand.
""Chase, what are you doing? Sophia said it wasn't her, so why are you all pushing her like this? Do you have any idea how bad this will look if it gets out?""
Maya threw her arms around Sophia, sobbing. ""Enough! That's enough! She's not even married! She's going to seriously hurt herself if she takes all of those!""
By now, a cold sweat was breaking out on Sophia's forehead as cramps seized her stomach.
Even so, she forced herself to stay upright, opened her palm toward Chase, and showed him the single pill remaining.

I'll start first :D

Our bags were already half-packed near the closet. I hunched towards at my bag beside me and pulled it like a snail eating it’s leaf. I went through it again even though I'd checked it twice last night. Extra water bottle, small towel, notebook, a ballpoint pen that still had ink. I zipped it shut and I pulled my scrunched socks off from the side pocket. When I tried to fold my socks properly, I realized that they ended up mismatched. One navy, one black.

""Seriously?"" Sumireko said from the doorway. She held a granola bar in her mouth and pointed at my feet.

""I didn't do it on purpose.""

She squinted. ""You always say that.""

Merry stepped out of the bathroom, walking towards her bedroom before she stopped for a moment. She glanced at my socks and smiled like she'd expected it. ""It's fine. Nobody's inspecting your ankles.""

""I'm inspecting her ankles,"" Sumireko smirked.

“You creep!” I exclaimed as I tossed a sock at her. But she just dodged and ran away with a laugh after it hit the wall with a soft thud.

*Ugh, she’s such a gremlin.* I thought as I tried to break myself from this black hole of a futon.

I just dragged myself to the bathroom and cleaned the drowsiness from my face before I stared at the mirror. I stared at her tired eyes for a moment but she doesn’t look too tired at all. I just shrugged it off and brushed my teeth before I changed into my usual fit.

There was something light in the room that didn't feel like the usual morning chaos. Maybe because we knew what today was, even though none of us had said the words. A last trip before the end of whatever came before.

I went to the kitchen to grab a meal and saw Sumireko standing in front of the microwave, watching the bentos spin like she was monitoring a scientific experiment. Merry sat at the table with a cup of coffee, her hands wrapped around it as if she was trying to absorb the warmth straight into her bones.

Sumireko glanced at me. “Don’t touch anything yet. These curry rice bentos are still colder than my dead hamster.”

Merry gave a slow blink. “Your hamster isn’t cold. It’s frozen solid.”

Sumireko pointed dramatically at her. “Hey, respect the dead, okay? He was a good boy, you know?”

Merry just laughed slowly before she took another sip.

I pulled out a chair and sat across from Merry. “You could’ve heated them earlier.”

“If I wake up earlier, my soul will leave my body,” Sumireko said. “I’m protecting all of you, really.”

Merry took a sip of her coffee. “She’s says that every day.”

The microwave beeped. Sumireko lit up like she’d been waiting for that sound her whole life. She swung the door open and steam drifted out.

“Breakfast is ready. Barely.”

She placed the bentos on the table. Merry’s shoulders softened a little when she opened hers. “It looks kinda simple. But, it’s good.”

“That means she’s judging it,” Sumireko whispered to me.

“I heard that,” Merry muttered.

I grabbed my chopsticks. “You two argue more before breakfast than most people do in a week.”

“That’s called bonding,” Sumireko said.

The curry rice was warm and plain, but it tasted better than usual. Something about the morning made everything feel softer around the edges. Maybe it was the quiet. Or maybe it was the fact that none of us were pretending today was normal.

“Did you pack your power bank?” I asked.

Sumireko froze. “...Probably.”

Merry sighed. “She didn’t.”

“I might have,” Sumireko said again, but even she didn’t sound convinced.

I grabbed what I thought is my mug before I sipped something bitter. Next thing I know, I accidentally took a sip from Merry’s mug. She didn’t stop me, just narrowed her eyes. “Renko, that’s my only lifeline right now.”

“It tastes like decaf,” I said.

“It is decaf,” Merry replied, pulling the mug back toward her. “Please let me have it.”

Sumireko glanced over while chewing. “You two are weirdly clingy with coffee.”

“You say that,” I said, “but you cried when we ran out of bubble tea last week.”

“That was a tragic moment in my life,” Sumireko said. “Show some respect.”

Merry let out a quiet laugh. “You’re impossible.”

“Thank you,” Sumireko said, taking it as a compliment for some reason.

The three of us kept eating, trading small jokes and quiet glances. Nothing loud. Nothing sharp. Just that soft warmth that comes from people who have known each other long enough to fill silence without breaking it.",2,1765024488.0,Wattpad,5,1.0,False

I know that this was posted previously, but I need an ELI5 level of discourse regarding portable espresso machines. I finally settled on a Christmas gift for my amazing espresso snob partner, but now I’m having decision paralysis. I am torn between the Cera+ and OutIn Mino for him, obviously would love to go for the cheaper option given the current state of things, but not at the expense of product performance. It would primarily be used for travel because hotel coffee breaks his spirit a little bit, and we have a trip coming up, so I need to make a decision 😅 I also have no idea what all the fixin’s are. Like do I need a burr grinder? What about the basket size? For reference we have a Breville Bambino at home we use then double shot basket???

Also if you have any ideas for complimentary coffee snob presents I’m all ears! He’s the sweetest man in the world and coffee is one of his pleasures in life.

1pfo3a9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PokemonVioletScarlet/comments/1pfo3a9/are_you_searching_purpose_of_human_life/,are you searching purpose of human life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

The last app date I went on, he picked me up and asked me to plan the date essentially. I asked for coffee and dessert. He essentially GPS'ed the closest starbucks in the hood, it was inside a grocery store. He proceeded to walk inside and we ordered drinks and he graciously told me I was allowed to order dessert. I just had a hot chocolate that did not agree with me. We sat in his musty mustang in the parking lot sipping our drinks as he stared at me and shared his unfiltered feral thoughts. I asked him to take me back home as soon as possible.

2. if you are a sentinel, leave the generators to the survivalists and supports, as they have perks and passives that make them stronger by doing them.  
3. As a killer, focus on one survivor. by constantly shifting targets, you give the survivors time to heal and regroup.  
4. As a killer, Focus on survivors in this order : Supports, Survivalists, Sentinels, as an Elliot main, so many people I have played against have lost a round because they allowed a support to complete their objectives, which makes them stronger. (Please correct me if I am wrong here)  
5. Use survivors and killers to their strengths - For example - John Doe - He is a trapper, and excels at cutting off key areas to survivors.  
6. as a survivor, USE LOOPING SPOTS! it may seem like a cheap tactic, but in a game where you are pretty much a sheep against a wolf, sometimes, running in circles is the best thing you can do.

I'm more interested in creating and sharing spaces where we can come together and celebrate literacy. Having worked as a professional author since 2010, I've seen many changes in the publishing industry and still have to confront two common myths: that Black people don't buy books, and that young Black people definitely don't. I've never believed this, but often some spaces don't serve us well, like many bookstores here in Los Angeles. That's why I've had few events in bookstores and instead choose to hold events at small businesses, such as coffee shops and cafes.

Then I crashed hard. Couldn't get out of bed. Couldn't focus. Couldn't feel anything except empty. That's when I realized ""manning up"" was killing me.

Here's what actually helped when nothing else did:

1. Depression doesn't look like sadness for men I wasn't crying or feeling sad. I was angry, numb, and exhausted all the time. Slept 12 hours and still felt drained. Snapped at everyone. Stopped caring about things I used to love. That's what male depression actually looks like.

Recognize it: Constant irritability, no energy, loss of interest in hobbies, feeling nothing instead of feeling sad. If that's you, it's not weakness - it's a real problem that needs real help.

2. Talking doesn't make you less of a man I thought therapy was for people who couldn't handle life. Then I went and realized it's for people smart enough to get help before they break completely. Best decision I ever made. My therapist gave me actual tools, not just ""cheer up"" BS.

Start here: Find a therapist who specializes in men's issues. One session. That's all you commit to. If it helps, keep going. If not, try a different one. Shop around like you would for anything else important.

3. Your body holds trauma you don't remember I had panic attacks I couldn't explain. Tight chest, couldn't breathe, felt like dying. Turns out stress from years of ""toughing it out"" was stored in my nervous system. Talk therapy helped my mind. Breathwork and exercise helped my body.

Try this: When anxiety hits, do 20 push-ups or run for 2 minutes. Burn off the adrenaline physically. Your body needs to discharge the stress it's holding.

4. Isolation makes everything worse I pulled away from friends because I didn't want to burden them. Big mistake. The more alone I got, the darker my thoughts became. Men are taught to be independent but isolation during mental health struggles is dangerous.

Action step: Text one friend this week. Say ""I've been struggling lately, can we grab coffee?"" You don't have to dump everything on them. Just connect. Humans need humans.

5. Mental health isn't about ""fixing"" yourself I kept waiting to be ""fixed"" so I could start living again. Wrong approach. You manage mental health, you don't cure it. Some days are good. Some are hard. That's normal. Tools help you navigate the hard days better.

Daily practice: Rate your mental state 1-10 each morning. Below 5? Use your tools (breathwork, call someone, go outside, move your body). Track patterns. Know your warning signs.

6. You're not broken, your coping methods are I ""handled"" stress with alcohol, overworking, porn, and anger. Those aren't coping - they're avoidance. I needed actual skills: setting boundaries, processing emotions, asking for what I need, resting without guilt.

Learn these: How to identify what you're feeling (mad/sad/scared/hurt), how to communicate needs without aggression, how to rest without feeling lazy, how to ask for help directly.

The daily mental health routine that saved me:

Morning: 10-minute walk outside (sunlight + movement) Midday: Check in with myself (Am I okay? What do I need?) Evening: One thing that brings joy (music, cooking, gaming, whatever) Night: Journal 3 sentences about the day

Your mental health matters just as much as your physical health. Ignoring it doesn't make you strong - it makes you a ticking time bomb.

Get help before you break. Future you will thank you.
