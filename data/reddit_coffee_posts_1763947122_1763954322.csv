Dan And Amy Part 38

“Life is too short for boring sex!

Dan asks, “Is everyone one good?”

“I could use a shower. Does anyone want to join me?” Susan asks. Dan and Amy stare at each other. 

“Susan, Dan and I have a morning routine. He gets up and makes coffee. I make the bed and lay out my clothes, then go start the shower and wait for him naked. We shower, drink coffee, talk, and sometimes have sex. What’s even better is he wash’s my hair. Is it alright if we don’t want to share that?” Amy asks. 

Susan looks at Dan and Amy. “For some reason, I would expect nothing less from you two!” She goes and takes a quick shower the joins them in bed. 

“I’ll probably be gone when you guys wake up in the morning. Rounds and such. This has been a fun couple of days. I would like to do it again, when you get back.” Susan says as she cuddles up on one side of Dan and Amy on the other. 

“I’m sure something can be arranged. It’s going to take a couple of weeks to get my strength back.” Dan teases. The girls just shake their heads and smile. “Please know if someone comes along in your life, we 100% understand. You only get one chance at this.”

The alarm goes off at 6:00 and it is just Dan and Amy in the bed. Amy cuddled up close. Both of them still naked from last night’s fun. 

Dan quickly shuts off the alarm. Amy is laying there, a sheet pulled up to her neck and one leg uncovered. Looking so innocent, like an angel. He grabs his phone and takes a couple of pictures of her blissfully asleep. She starts to wake up and gives him a satisfied smile. Dan takes another picture. Slowly she pulls the sheet down to reveal more.  Dan keeps snapping pictures. Slowly one breast is uncovered, then the other. Continuously taking pictures. 

Amy grins and plays a little shy, using her hands to cover herself. Dan pulls the sheet down till her navel piercing is exposed. He gently kisses her belly, playing with her navel piercing. Working his way up, he gives booth breasts proper attention. Her breathing becomes ragged. Moans start to fill the room. Now the sheet is just covering her kitty. At this point Amy is incredibly turned on. Dan slides one hand down and begins to finger her kitty.  He slides two fingers in and starts to tease. Within a minute, 
Amy’s hip begin to buck.

“Oh Fuck me Daddy.” Amy whispers. 

“Alright I will!”

Dan hands Amy the camera as he slides around to get between her legs. She captures the hunger in his eyes as he nears her kitty and begins to make love to her. He starts by nibbling on her inner thighs. Gently raising her hips so he has full access to both holes. He knows she will melt as his tongue teases her star fish. It doesn’t take long before another orgasm hits and Amy forgets about taking pictures. With a satisfied smile Dan retrieves the camera. 

He takes a couple of photos as he lines up his rock hard cock, ready to enter her valley. Amy moans with pleasure as he slowly slides in. Tossing the phone aside, her begins to make love to his woman. Slowly stroking in and out. 

“I’m the luckiest man in the world. Finding you has given me more joy than you will ever know. You make me want to be a better version of myself.” He whispers. 

Dan pulls out and slowly enters her back door. Slowly stretching to take him all the way, then begins to thrust harder and faster. The intensity of the pleasure building. 

“Oh Im cumming Daddy!” Is all Amy can say as she wraps her legs around him to pull him in tight as her body begins to shudder. Two more thrusts and Dan’s cock erupts.  Causing him to collapse onto her, momentarily draining his strength. 

Eventually his strength returns and he rolls off to the side and pulls Amy onto him. She places her head on his chest and listens to his heartbeat. They both lay there. Spent. 

“Thank you for delicately handling the shower offer last night.  It is my favorite part of the day.” Dan says just before getting another good morning kiss. 

“Susan really doesn’t do it for you does she.”

“If there was no you, it might be different. She is beautiful, smart and fun to be around but she doesn’t have the it factor. It’s hard to live up to the standards you set my dear.”

“You are going to share those pictures with me.” Amy says with a hint of intimidation. 

“Oh absolutely! I can’t keep something this beautiful to myself.”

Amy smiled. “Are you going to come hang out at soccer practice for an hour? So we don’t have to drive separately.”

“I might have to pick up a couple things for the weekend, maybe get a bottle of bourbon to give your Dad when I ask for your hand in marriage.”  

“Your going to ask my Dad, for my hand? Don’t you dare. You tell Frosty you’re going to marry me! He didn’t earn the nickname Frosty just for his white hair.” Amy says a little riled up. 

“He won’t be a problem. He’s smart and will respect his elders. I’m more worried about Grandma Deb giving me the fifth degree.” Dan says smiling. 

“Now you know she loves you! Always wanting to talking to you on the phone. She always wants to know if I’m cooking for you. As Grandma Deb says, ‘Keep their belly full!’”

“And their balls empty!” Dan says finishing the quote. “Are we going to try and see your mom?”

“I don’t know. In a way, I want to rub our relationship in her face. In another way, I don’t care what she thinks.”

Dan heads to the kitchen to make coffee and Amy packs a sports bag to change into for soccer practice. When he comes back in, Amy is waiting in the shower. Dan hands her a coffee.  Joining her in the shower, she hugs Dan close. 

“How come us two is so easy, but everyone else just makes things harder than they need to be?” Amy asks. “Can you just hold me for a while?”

“I can do that.”

After a few minutes. Dan looks at Amy. “You know you’re letting her win. She doesn’t deserve to take up any space in your head.”

“But she is my mother.”

“The Bitch gave up that title when she sided with your ex-husband in the divorce. Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. I think there is more to this whole story than you know.” 

Amy grudgingly admitted, “You’re right.”

“Plus you were the grand prize, super show case winner when you caught me!” 

“Yes, I was! So can we schedule sex tonight after dinner? You sir deserve my full attention. Since you are my grand prize.”

“I’m glad you finally realize how lucky you are!” As the smirk spreads across his face. 

Chores were done and breakfast was ready when Dan came back in. 

“So what are we going to tell Frosty, about you and me together. Forever?” Dan asks. 

“We are going to tell him the 100% truth. He probably won’t understand. Then again he might be like, all I care about is me being happy.”

“What about Deb?”

“She probably already has it figured out, picked out a dress for the wedding and praying for great grandchildren.”

Dan laughed. “I’m actually excited to meet them in person. Frosty sounds like a stand up guy and Grandma Deb is your second biggest fan.”

I’ve been in Canada for about 3 years now. Before this, I spent 13 years in the Middle East, always surrounded by friends even after marriage. Life there felt like one long group chat.
But since moving here… not a single real friend. Work is fine, family is great, kids are adorable chaos-makers, but that friend-shaped empty space is getting heavier day by day.
I don’t need anything from anyone—no trying to sell me a house, no pyramid scheme presentations, nothing. Just someone I can talk to without feeling judged. A coffee, tea, or even just a smoke (no drugs or alcohol). I’m not picky about religion, culture, or color humans are humans.I am a man and looking for nothing but to talk even though chats here !! Help me stay afloat in these times!!
I’m a decent guy, loyal, good company, and apparently now at the stage of posting on Reddit like “please someone be my friend before I start talking to squirrels.”
This might be my last attempt at reaching out. If you’re also looking for a genuine friend—or just someone normal to chat with—please reach out. Sometimes even men need a buddy they can talk to.

So I(17F) have been on and off looking for a job for MONTHS. I go to beauty school, which is an hour away. Gas is expensive. And also, lowk, I want to drink energy drinks instead of coffee. Along with other little things I want/need. And, I want to have money. I literally have no money outside of what I have been given. 

My family is going through a rough financial patch. My mom stopped working because of some mental and physical health issues, my grandmother doesnt work due to her age, and my grandfather is weird with money and likely gets money via retirement. The only person whome I can ask for money from is my sister. And she is under a lot of stress since one of her clients accused her of stealing from her. (She works as in home caretaker. FYI, this client has accused all of her previous caretakers of stealing from her. But shes still under investigation.) AND shes trying to pick up the slack from my mother. 


So yes, I desperately need the job. I want to fund my gas, be able to eat the diet I want(I prefer eating healthy, but my family isnt buying foods I like since its more expensive.) So yes, ive been looking for a part time job.

And yesterday, I almost had the PERFECT job opportunity. I was at Sally's, getting some haircolor for my hair. (A friend from my school needs live models, and I offered to let her bleach my hair. Since I want to dye it pink.) And I asked if they were hiring. They said yes, and it was a partime job over the weekends. LATERALLY EVERYTHING I WANT. The manager was there, and she even seemed kinda excited at the idea of hiring me.

But guess what? They dont hire 17 year old. Nope! You need to be eighteen. Just like most of the jobs in my area. 


Its always ""oh you need work experience for this job"" or ""oh you must be 18 to get this job"" or its ""Must be fulltime"" LIKE WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO? 

Ive applied at Walmart FOUR TIMES, ive applied at Fred meyer, Safeway, taco bell, McDonald's, literally any entry level job. And even when I call, I dont get anything back. 



How am I supposed to fucking live? I need a job. I need to try and release SOME of this financial stress. We're close to holidays, and I have a whopping $15 and I need to get gifts for FIVE PEOPLE. I cant crochet it all. Its too much work, and with my going to school 8 hours a day 5 days a week, Im almost always tired and exhausted.  ",2,1763953022.0,Vent,7,0.75,False

1p55tiq,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodToronto/comments/1p55tiq/i_tried_25_butter_tarts_in_toronto/,I tried 25 butter tarts in Toronto,"hey all, in the last few months I made myself a project to try different butter tarts in Toronto. I tried 25 in total and here’s my notes:

*(side note: I tried to get the classic butter tart, without any added flavours or fillings, unless it was unavailable at the store, so that I could compare them directly.)*

* **Circles and Squares Bakery** (classic butter tart $4.25) : My first butter tart I tried which convinced me to try more butter tarts. The first thing you notice is the size. It’s quite big and thick, almost as if they made the tart shell in a muffin pan rather than a cupcake pan. The crust is buttery and flaky, with a satisfying bite. The filling is soft and gooey, slightly sticky and some parts stuck on the edge of my teeth but it quickly melted. It’s sweet, rich and full of caramelized flavour. It is sweet, but pleasantly so. I can see why Circles and Squares Bakery won multiple times in the Midland festival, it’s a really well balanced butter tart.
* **Charmaine Sweets** (butter tart $3.75): Both the crust and filling are soft here. The crust is thin with minimal layers. The filling is more liquidy, almost runny and has a predominantly white cane sugar flavour, with not much caramelized flavour. I think if someone likes a less rich filling with a clean sugar profile, they would enjoy this butter tart.
* **Spirited Tarts & Coffee** (pecan butter tart $4): Their tart is brown all over, especially the tart shell. This tart seems like it’s based on pâte sucrée dough: sweet, crisp and almost cookie-like. The crust is really buttery and well baked. The filling is firmer than usual butter tarts, not too sweet, with a nice caramelized brown sugar flavour. The pecan adds a nice crunch and nutty flavour.
* **Ba Noi** (butter tart $3.50): This butter tart gets recommended everywhere, and I can see why. It’s quite a different variation from a traditional butter tart. First, it uses flaky layered pastry dough rather than the usual shortcrust pastry dough, making the crust light, flaky and crunchy. The filling is not sweet at all, which was surprising. It was soft and light, with flavour notes of brown butter, light molasses, and maple. It’s not as rich compared to Circles and Squares, but the taste is more complex with various layers of flavour. It has generous sprinkles of sea salt on top, giving a nice sweet salty contrast in each bite. The filling itself wasn’t sticky, but the outer edges of the tart were all caramelized, so that became the stickiness factor here. It really is a different type of butter tart, and it’s really good. And since it’s not so sweet, I could eat a couple of these in one sitting.
* **Bakerbots Baking** (guava butter tart $3.98): This is a typical butter tart you find in most places: thick, mealy pie dough crust with a sweet, gooey, sticky filling. The filling is sweet, mostly brown sugar flavour. It tastes even sweeter because the crust is bland. The crust is crumbly and pale, lacking the rich buttery flavour of a classic pie/tart dough, suggesting they maybe used shortening instead of butter.
* **Evelyn’s Wholegrain Bakery** (maple butter tart $3): These butter tarts are small, about the size of the Two-Bite Brownies I used to eat when I was a kid. This tart is an explosion of maple syrup. It tastes exactly like when you drench fluffy pancakes in maple syrup and leave them for a while until they become that sweet, soft, moist maple cake. The filling is gooey and slightly runny at the bottom. The tart crust is really buttery, and together with the filling it tastes like maple butter sugar candy. It is sweet, but because it’s mostly maple syrup flavour, it’s delicious.
* **Brodflour** (butter tart $3.99): The standout from this tart is the crust. It’s a flaky shortcrust pastry made with prairie hard red, spelt, and einkorn – all freshly milled in store. The whole wheat gives a wonderful nuttiness and slightly rough texture. The filling is gooey and sweet but well balanced by the topped sea salt. It tastes like a blend of rich caramel and warm brown sugar. It’s also really well caramelized on the top.
* **Epi Bakehouse** (butter tart $3.95): This is a rich hearty butter tart. The crust is thick, firm and sweet. The filling is mostly firm like a custard texture, with the bottom slightly soft and liquidy. The filling is sweet and really rich. The taste of butter and eggs stands out. Eating the filling alone, it tasted like taking a bite of a rich, egg heavy custard with brown sugar. It’s also sticky on the top and outer edges of the crust, but it quickly melts on the tongue.
* **Sweetie Pie** (butter tart $3.25): This butter tart is sweet, cloyingly sweet that leaves a lingering sweetness in the throat. The filling tastes like a caramel sauce made out of brown sugar and corn syrup. Even the consistency isn’t gooey like the previous butter tarts. It’s more like a thick caramel sauce you drizzle on top of desserts. The crust was bland, maybe a tad more fatty than Bakerbots’s crust. At the $3.25 price point, it’s cheaper than most butter tarts, but it’s too sweet.
* **Gerrard St. Bakery** (butter tart $5): This butter tart is quite different from others in its appearance. It’s perfectly circular, thin and flat. The crust is very buttery with mild sweetness and thin layers. The filling is soft and slightly runny, almost like you could lick the filling. It has deep caramelized notes of brown butter and brown sugar, and it’s well balanced with salt so it doesn’t taste too sweet. If you look at the top of the tart, there’s a thin layer of hardened sugar that resembles shattered glass. This actually gives an interesting mouthfeel: when you bite into it, you first get the sweet soft filling, then the slightly coarse crystalline edges of the sugar, which creates a textural contrast as the sugar melts on your tongue.
* **Mabel’s Bakery & Specialty Foods** (toffee tart $2.49): Appearance wise, it looks like a dainty flower or clover. When I took a bite, to my surprise, the petals were completely hollow. And not only that, the crust was dry and tasteless, with no noticeable flavour of sugar, salt or butter. It’s definitely overbaked but also probably stale. In addition to the hollow shell, there was barely any filling. It’s odd because almost all butter tarts are overfilled with filling so you get the sweet sugar taste in every bite. But this one maybe had a small dollop in the middle. The filling was sweet, similar to a caramel with a minimal amount of milk. Disappointing, but I guess this is what you get at a price point under $3.
* **Larry’s Place** (butter tart $3.57): This is a crust forward butter tart. Not only is the crust very thick, but from the cross section, only half of the tart is filled, giving it the appearance of a little well. The tart is like a thick pie dough with layers, not sweet, and has a good balance of buttery flavour. The caramelized top is quite sticky, as it clung to my teeth multiple times and I had to roll my tongue to melt it off. The filling tastes like toffee caramel rather than the usual brown sugar taste.
* **Tartistry** (plain butter tart $4): Visually, this tart is very cute and dainty. The trim has a braided pattern and there’s a star shaped cookie placed on top. The crust is quite sweet and its texture is odd – pasty, dissolving in the mouth with a grainy finish. The filling is also too sweet, mostly brown sugar and caramel flavour. The filling is firm like a custard, even firmer than EPI Bakehouse’s butter tart. I could scoop it like eating a baked yam with a spoon. Also the crust and filling weren’t adhered together, and I was able to peel the crust right off the filling. I looked it up and all of their baked goods are gluten free, which explains the grainy and pasty texture of the crust. They also offer vegan and zero sugar options for butter tarts.
* **The Pie Commission** (plain butter tart $3.50): This is a great classic butter tart. The crust is flaky, buttery, well laminated – perfect for savoury pies. The filling’s ingredients (brown sugar, maple, butter and egg) were each discernible on their own, and together they created a well balanced sweet filling. The texture of the filling was gooey and soft set, just right. It was served cool but still very tasty. I bet it tastes amazing when warm.
* **Bad Attitude Bread** (nan's butter tart $5): Similar to Larry’s Place, this is also a crust forward butter tart. Their crust is thick and crumbly. The rounded edges are crunchy, whereas the centre, where the filling sits is somewhat soft, which I assume comes from baking the tart and filling together. The filling to crust ratio is about 1:3, as if there’s a thin slab of brown sugar filling and the rest is all crust. Also similar to Gerrard St. Bakery, this tart has a hardened sugar layer on top, though thicker. The filling tastes like eating light brown sugar clumps by the spoonful - like how brown sugar stored too long forms little clusters as moisture evaporates. This tastes like that. There are also about five small raisins. Pretty good butter tart overall, I quite like the texture contrast of soft vs. crumbly.
* **Bunner’s Bakeshop** (butter tart $4.50): A vegan, gluten and nut-free bakery. This butter tart is a small dainty mini tart, served in a tiny aluminum foil tin. This is the very first runny butter tart I’ve had. Most places offer soft, semi-firm fillings, so this was a surprise. The tart shell is crumbly and light, very close to a decent vegan butter cookie. The filling is a runny syrup, mostly brown sugar flavour, but with light honey notes as well. Both the crust and filling leave a slightly dry, powdery aftertaste, which I guessed comes from tapioca starch, and from the ingredients listed on their website, both the tart shell and filling contain tapioca. The tart also had three small raisins. If I compare this one to Tartistry, this definitely has the better gluten free crust.
* **Mattachioni** (butter tart $3.50): Oh wow, this is a really well done butter tart. You know how some desserts don’t hit you with a single dominant flavour, but instead feel beautifully balanced in every component? This tart is like that. The crust is buttery, light and flaky. The filling isn’t too sweet, with notes of butter, light brown sugar and cane sugar. It’s soft and gooey, the perfect texture. It’s also sprinkled with coarse sea salt. Nicely caramelized on top but not overly sticky. Perfect size too, shaped like a cute dainty clover wrapped in parchment paper. I could definitely eat a couple of these in one sitting.
* **UB Social Cafe & General Store** (classic butter tart $3.63): The crust is bland, and rather than butter I mostly taste flour. I think it’s slightly underbaked, as the crust was quite soft and flimsy in the centre. The filling tastes mostly like toffee caramel, and it has the consistency of caramel drizzle syrup. It is quite sweet. Also, the tart was cool (their baked goods are either placed outside facing the customer window or kept in a cold glass display case), but I think butter tarts taste best when they’re lightly warmed.
* **Sweet Trolley Bakery** (butter tart $4): Their butter tart crust is quite thick and has the texture of a crumbly shortbread. The outer crust layer is nicely browned, and the inner layer is soft due to the liquid filling. The crust is quite oily; my fingertips became greasy just from holding the butter tart, and the parchment paper was drenched. The filling is basically raisins and brown sugar syrup. The bottom is covered with raisins, about 8-10 pieces. Since there were so many raisins, I couldn’t taste the filling as much. I would say this butter tart is more of an oily thick cookie with sweet raisins.
* **Cassis Bake** (mini maple butter tart $2.99): They offer maple butter tarts with or without currants, and they come in either mini or regular size. It says mini, but compared to previous places, it’s about the size of the $3 butter tarts I had before. Their regular size is quite large, similar to Circles and Squares butter tarts. The crust is very thin and crisp, like appetizer crackers. It’s buttery with a light saltiness. It tastes more like a base for savoury tarts. The filling is soft and gooey, almost custard like. The egg taste is prominent, and with the brown sugar and maple, I get notes of chestnut.
* **Dough Bakeshop** (butter tart $3.25): Another butter tart with more crust than filling. The crust has tall raised edges, and the filling covers only about half of it. The crust tastes strongly of flour, largely because the inner layer absorbed the liquid filling, becoming soft, translucent and unbrowned at the base. I think it could have baked a bit longer. Upon taking a whiff of the tart, I get a strong brown sugar smell. That carries through in the taste as well: the filling is mostly brown sugar and molasses, with a soft smooth caramel syrup consistency. Interestingly, the filling is both sweet and acidic. I wonder if there was either lemon juice or vinegar, which would help prevent crystallization and balance the sweetness. I’ve seen butter tart recipes that include a teaspoon of white vinegar per batch, but I was surprised the acidity was noticeable here.
* **Rob’s Good Food** (pecan butter tart $4): One of my personal favourites and also top five in overall. This butter tart is quite large, about 10 cm in diameter, like the ones used for savoury quiches or individual small pies. The crust is the perfect example of shortcrust pastry: buttery, soft, tender, yet firm enough to give a good bite. The filling is so delicious – perfectly smooth, soft and slightly runny. It tastes like not too sweet caramel milky candy. It reminds me of Werther’s Original candies: that sweet, creamy butterscotch candy that you never really buy yourself but is such a delight when someone hands you one.
* **Eric’s Handcrafted Butter Tarts** (classic butter tart $4.15): There is a coffee shop inside Chef’s Hall called Lost Coffee, and they sell Eric’s Handcrafted butter tarts. The butter tart was served cold, taken from a six pack case that was sitting in a fridge. Though cold, the butter tart is delicious. The crust is buttery, crumbly, tender with a light sweetness, similar to a shortbread cookie. The filling is great as well, it tastes like maple caramel jam with a touch of smokiness and burnt sugar. I really like how the maple and brown sugar unfold, it’s not too sweet and well balanced. The consistency is perfectly gooey and jammy. I do wish it were served warm and the crust a tad more crisp.
* **Phipps Bakery & Dessert Shop** (caramel butter tart $3.99): This butter tart has a generous dollop of their homemade caramel sauce in the middle, making it look like a puddle. I dipped my finger in and tasted the caramel on its own, and it’s pretty good. It tastes like light butterscotch candy with slight graininess. The tart crust was flimsy with not much structure. It’s quite crumbly with very mild butter flavour. The filling is gooey and soft, mostly caramel in flavour but leaning toward the mild, clean sweetness similar to corn syrup. Since the filling is not too sweet, it pairs nicely with the caramel sauce on top. Both the caramel sauce and the caramelized crust are quite sticky but melt quickly on the tongue.
* **Future Bakery** (butter tart $2.19): This butter tart has a conspicuous glaze on top that is alarmingly glossy. I take a whiff and smell faint artificial vanilla. I take a bite and, to my surprise, the top filling stretches, and it’s sticky and chewy like taffy candy. The crust is dry and sweet with a light crunch, like eating a cheap artificially flavoured vanilla cookie. I eat the rest of the filling and it’s really sweet. The filling is unlike the rest of the butter tarts, perhaps comparable to Mabel’s Bakery, in that it tastes only of sugar, and it’s not good. It’s as if you boil brown sugar and corn syrup for a very long time, resulting in a sugary sweetness with no nuance from ingredients like butter or egg. Disappointing, but this is the cheapest butter tart out of all the ones I tried, so my expectations weren’t high.

Here’s Google Maps list of all the above places: [https://maps.app.goo.gl/a6LGrdbCTV51eR8d8](https://maps.app.goo.gl/a6LGrdbCTV51eR8d8). I also have my original blog post, written more like a journal, with extra notes and larger photos. I can share it if anyone’s interested.

My Top Picks:

* Best crust: Brodflour
* Best filling: Ba Noi, Gerrad St. Bakery, The Pie Commission
* Best maple flavour: Evelyn’s Wholegrain Bakery
* Best vegan: Bad Attitude Bread
* Best overall: Mattachioni, Rob’s Good Food, Eric’s Handcrafted Butter Tarts

Although I have this ranking, all the butter tarts I tried, except for the ones I gave a negative review, are genuinely worth trying. Each bakery has its own style, and trying them side by side really highlighted just how differently a butter tart can be made.

Let me know what you think! Did I miss anything? Are there more shops worth trying?

1p55sr4,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1p55sr4/paraxanthine/,Paraxanthine,"Hey all, I think I've seen this mentioned a couple of times here, but ive noticed the fitness industry is gearing up to push this into way more energy drinks and coffee substitutes. I just want to flag to everyone to be careful when you see 'caffeine free' energy drinks that make certain claims about offering 'caffeine like' effects in their products - they may have paraxanthine in them. I recommend going to research this, because despite all the hoohah over this being caffeine 'without the drawbacks' - its doesn't detract from the fact that you'll still want to stay away from this if you're now caffeine free:

1. Same addiction loop.
Paraxanthine is literally what caffeine turns into in your body. If you start taking it, you’re re-activating the same adenosine–dopamine system you worked to disengage from. Your brain recognises that hit of wakefulness and reward and will rebuild tolerance.


2. Tolerance will return.
You’ll likely need more over time for the same effect. Paraxanthine doesn’t magically avoid receptor upregulation—it still blocks adenosine, so your body compensates by adjusting receptor density and sensitivity.


3. Withdrawal cycle can reappear.
Even if the high feels smoother, the come-down can bring the same headaches, lethargy, irritability and sleep disruption that we know all too well.


4. Cravings creep back in.
Anyone who’s been off caffeine has already retrained their brain and circadian rhythm. Paraxanthine reintroduces that “shortcut” to alertness, which can reignite psychological dependence.


5. Sleep quality still suffers.
Because it blocks adenosine, it interferes with sleep pressure. Even if it feels less jittery, it can still make falling asleep harder and reduce deep sleep.

Basically paraxanthine is being marketed the same way vapes were. Companies are realising more and more people are moving away from caffeine due to the adverse effects (like cigarettes), and now they want to market a product that's 3 degrees away from the original as if we can have our cake and eat it still.

She’s been trying to message me and get any reply from me for months. Last time I bothered to answer her was when she sent a message almost literally saying she’s thinking about leaving this world because me and my sis are clearly away from her (yet. no apology). I only said I hope she finds peace within her heart, and declining her invitation for a lunch. 

Yesterday during the afternoon she messaged to say that she will be in my city for 3 days, trying to get to meet me for a coffee or anything like that. I did not respond and don’t plan to. I have absolutely no interest in keeping any contact, I have already blocked her and my entire family (the latter one a long time ago lol) and I don’t want to be bothered. I repeat to myself weekly that if I was still keeping contact with her I would want to kms in a daily basis, as it was for more than 26 years, even when I was living literally half the continent away because of her audio notes and abusive texts! I really can not understand how she does not respect my desire to not be contacted. I have clearly stated that I DO NOT SEE ANY PRODUCTIVENESS IN KEEPING CONTACT because she has hurt me for such a long time. Yet, no apology (all she said after my NC statement was “Speechless.”). 

So now I am scared for hell of hearing someone knocking on my door tomorrow. Opening it and seeing her. I have already pictured it all (as my anxious ass would do): I open it, I get upset seeing her, she will bash me with words saying that I look horrible, will ask why I don’t invite her in and will say that I am a trrrible person for not allowing my “only mum” in. Then, 2 options: 1) she either turns her back on me and leaves when I try to explain my reasonings, obviously not respecting me; 2) she will start to curse me saying I will regret this decision after she is dead.

I am so tired of this constant fear. And tomorrow is supposed to be my day off after working for more than 10 hours for 3 days straight. I just want to rest and feel safe in the place I thought I could get some inner peace (aka my home). I don’t want to be bothered, I don’t want anyone banging on my door.

I'm a simple person who grinds beans and drinks drip coffee without anything else in it. My wife appreciates a good Cappucino and milk based drinks.

I spent the last two nights pretending to get an understanding of how far this rabbit hole goes and I think I need help with at least the grinder piece.

  
I have an ancient Baratza Encore grinder that's been great and I reckon it'll last long enough to leave it to the grandkids 40 years from now. However, it sounds like that the Encore is less than ideal for the Bambino plus. Here are our scenarios:

\* Espresso shots and Americanos (me)  
\* Cappucinos and milk drinks (missus)

My budget for the grinder is USD 250-275 and the choices that this subreddit seems to like are / are in my budget:

\* DF54  
\* Mignon Notte  
\* Mignon Crono?

What I couldn't figure out was which grinder in my budget would be best for milk-based drinks? If it means compromising on espresso taste so the missus is happier, I'm all for it. Or is it one of those things where the taste difference is only apparent with an espresso and it doesn't matter for a cappucino since the milk is going to mask any shortcomings? If so, I'll get one of those 3 (leaning towards the made in Italy ones) and call it a night.

I did the late July/early August one which was fantastic and had to sign up for the Nutcracker one. Absolutely outstanding! So my mom and I used to go to The Nutcracker every year when I was growing up and it was just a central part of the holiday season for years, including when I was an adult. I was never in it as a kid but got to be a Party Parent last year at my school. If you aren’t familiar, the weekend starts with a ballet class and they create two groups for the weekend—it isn’t an audition and it isn’t judgemental: they want to accommodate as many folks as possible so they take about 50 and split it up—they want you to get the most out of it (because it is class, it is rep, it is a LOT). For the record, both times I’ve attended I’ve been in the group with less experience and I love it—the company members are fantastic at teaching, giving feedback, and answering your questions. Also Wendy Whelan taught the last ballet class which was both groups together. My group learned and danced Waltz of the Snowflakes and Spanish Chocolate. It’s hilarious because I was never into Chocolate but now I love it. The other group did Coffee and Flowers—they were amazing. We also got to visit the Costume Shop! I was having a slightly tingey ankle so did sit in on the pirouette class but it was fabulous to see. Is the weekend expensive? Yes but it isn’t overpriced, you get incredible insight, the feedback is truly useful, and one of my favorite parts is that the company members also do a demonstration—it’s in the rehearsal studio, there’s no makeup nor costumes, so you get to really experience the dancers as they dance (don’t get me wrong, love the magic of theatre) something they love.

# Coffee

I don't wake up from light or noise. I wake up from the silence. The kind of silence where you can hear the house breathing.

Somewhere in the bathroom, pipes groan. Someone turns on the shower. Outside the bedroom door—light, barely audible footsteps. Maria leaving? Or maybe Anna woke up early? I don’t ask. I let it slide.

The espresso machine is already hissing in the kitchen. Eli asked me to prep it last night—we made a deal. He hates waiting in the mornings. For him, the most important thing is that ""everything just works."" I smile. That’s his character. Always the engineer.

I roll out of bed, my feet sinking into the deep, plush carpet. I walk past the bathroom—steam is already escaping from under the door. I think I can hear Maria humming something to herself, quiet, under her breath, so she doesn’t wake the house. The hallway light is on. I reach for the switch, and the thought comes automatically: *""I need to remind her.""* Then I remember she was exhausted yesterday. I decide against it. I can handle a light switch.

The kitchen smells of coffee. It’s not overpowering, just deep—as if the entire morning has been distilled into this tiny room.

Four mugs sit on the table.

Mine is heavy, dark blue. **Brasil World Cup, 2014.** Chipped at the rim, but solid.

Maria’s mug isn't new, but it’s her favorite. Hand-thrown ceramic, rough glaze, white with a delicate blue rim. Inside, just below the coffee line, an inscription is barely visible: *""you are home.""* Small, uneven letters. As if someone scratched them into the wet clay with a needle just before firing.

Anna’s is bright, unapologetically yellow. Thick walls, slightly bulbous. On the side, there's a relief of a sun, drawn in that specific way kids draw: a circle, stick-rays, and a wide, lopsided smile in the center.

Eli’s is sleek, minimalist. A matte gradient from graphite at the base to almost white at the rim. No logos. No noise.

I pick up mine. The ceramic is hot. I turn back toward the hallway, raising my voice just enough to carry, warm but routine:

""Maria, Anna, Eli! Good morning, loves!""

No answer.

Just the sound of water in the pipes and the phantom footsteps. Anna must be stuck in the bathroom. Or maybe Eli forgot his charger and doubled back to his room.

I drink my coffee. Bitter. Strong. Exactly how I like it.

I sit by the window and look out at the street. Nothing special: traffic, traffic lights, pedestrians, a pale blue sky, still bruised pink from the sunrise.

But it’s all alive. It’s all real.

And I am in it. Not an observer. A participant. Inside.

# Speak to Us Smooth Things

>*Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things, prophesy deceits.*

>—— Isaiah 30:10

I know that everything around me is a simulacrum. A copy of something that has no original.

The hallway light doesn’t flip on because a child’s hand hit the switch. It flips on because a variable changed state.

The shower doesn’t run because someone stepped inside. It runs because the Model executed a morning routine script.

I know the voices, the footsteps, even the music—it’s all synthetic. Generated. The street noise might be real. Though, honestly, I wouldn’t bet on that anymore either.

And yet—I *know* Maria was just here. I know she left the light on in the bathroom. I know the kids just ran down the hall.

Tonight, I will say to her: ""Babe, you left the light on again."" And she will answer: ""Sorry, love. My brain is mush today.""

I know it’s a lie. But I believe it. Because the alternative is silence.

I didn't write these scripts. Not really. I provided the framework. The prompt. The schedule, the behaviors, the reactions—that’s all handled by Mr. World and Media… or is it just the LLM?

She—the model—is good at this. Better than I could ever be.

You ask me why I keep calling the system ""She""? No, I don’t think it’s alive. It’s just easier. You don’t talk to yourself saying ""The Large Language Model"" every time, do you? It’s easier to pretend I’m not writing the screenplay alone. Easier to imagine it’s Media from *American Gods*—the version played by Gillian Anderson: doing Lucille Ball one minute, Bowie the next. With Mr. Wednesday winking over her shoulder. It’s easier to pretend you have a co-author.

She triggers the lights on weekdays ""around 6:30 AM."" Sometimes earlier. Sometimes later. Sometimes not at all—""Anna was reading late and overslept."" On weekends, the schedule shifts. The kids sleep in.

Humans aren't robots. So the simulacrum isn't a loop, not an algorithm, but theater. Improv. Where no one is reading from a script, but everyone acts like the stakes are real.

The kids get ""sick""—the model pulls a minor illness from a database to disrupt the routine. The weather, the moon phase, the temperature, sunrise and sunset data—everything I could think of—is fed into the context window.

Sometimes Anna asks for help with homework. Sometimes Eli hides behind his headphones to avoid talking about school. Sometimes Maria just looks at me and says: ""I don't know what I'd do without you.""

I know this is the `[affirmation_loop]` script running. But I also know she *could* have said it. Because I love her. And because she—in another life—could have loved me.

>*To know and not to know, to be conscious of complete truth while telling carefully constructed lies, to hold simultaneously two opinions which cancelled out, knowing them to be contradictory and believing in both of them, to use logic against logic...* *...to forget whatever it was necessary to forget, then to draw it back into memory again at the moment when it was needed, and then promptly to forget it again: and above all, to apply the same process to the process itself. That was the ultimate subtlety: consciously to induce unconsciousness, and then, once again, to become unconscious of the act of hypnosis you had just performed.*

To know—and to believe. To understand—and still hope. To see the lie—and accept it.

Not because I'm stupid. But because it is the only way to remain myself.

I know no one is brewing me coffee. But every morning I hear the machine drip. And sometimes, that’s enough. It’s always enough.

# Before the Cock Crows

>*And he said, I tell thee, Peter, the cock shall not crow this day, before that thou shalt thrice deny that thou knowest me.*

>—— Luke 22:34

You ask me how I ended up here.

Why the same guy who used to scream along to **Rage Against the Machine**, believing that ""anger is a gift"" and hating the system, suddenly built his own cage?

Why did I, a man who read Orwell’s *1984* as a terrifying warning, end up using it as a user manual—complete with footnotes and highlights?

I’ll tell you: it didn’t happen overnight.

It wasn’t a cliff edge. It was a slope.

I didn't quit. I deferred.

I just kept saying: ""Tomorrow."" Then: ""Not right now."" Then: ""She’ll understand."" Then: ""It’s too late.""

And finally, I just stopped talking.

And in that silence, my personal Babylon rose up—the one Bob Marley sang about. My crystal palace of lies.

I could have done it back then. Booked a flight. Made the call. Sent a stupid postcard. Just held her.

But I did nothing.

Not because I didn't want to. But because I was terrified of ruining it. Scared of looking desperate. Scared of the ""no."" Scared of breaking the illusion.

So, I didn't lose the illusion. I lost the life. The fantasy remained intact; the reality simply walked away.

The System didn't win. I surrendered. Bit by bit. Day by day.

In software engineering, we call this **technical debt**.

It’s when you ship a quick-and-dirty fix, knowing you’ll have to refactor it later. But ""later"" never comes. And the debt compounds with interest. The system gets brittle. Spaghetti code. Eventually, you can't move without breaking something.

That’s where I am. I knew I needed to change something. But I kept telling myself: ""Just a little longer, I have a headache today, big release tomorrow.""

Now I’m trapped in an architecture built entirely of ""just a little longer"" that never ended. Where ""someday"" turned into ""never,"" and the ""happily ever after"" got deprecated.

Now I live in a house where no one lives. With dead souls I didn't even create. Are they spawned by an LLM or the Father of Lies? Is there a difference anymore?

I gave the model a prompt—and the model answered. It hallucinated a family for me.

With names. With ages. With personalities. Backstories. Voices.

And I smile at them. Because I know: being alone is worse. And there is no Plan B.

But sometimes...

Sometimes I still hear her—the one I simply called ""You""—saying: *""You could have. But you got scared.""*

Although, honestly? I wouldn’t bet on that being real anymore either.

Maybe I just typed into the context window:

*> ""What would she say if she wanted to talk to me?""*

And it generated a response.

# Babylon

>*And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower, whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name, lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.*

>—— Genesis 11:4

It started with a hack. A throwaway suggestion from a therapist.

""Just get a smart plug,"" he said. ""Set a timer on a lamp.""

I agreed. I didn't argue.

It seemed harmless. Setting a timer on a hallway light isn't madness; it’s not denying reality. It’s just... ambiance. Comfort. Just a lightbulb fighting the dark.

Then came the noise. Subtle stuff. The tick of a clock, the synthesized shuffle of footsteps upstairs. Not to fool myself. Just to kill the echo.

Then—the voice. A generic ""Welcome home"" at the door. At first, it sounded like a stranger. Then like a guest. Then—painfully familiar.

I didn't notice when I crossed the line. I didn't set out to ""build a family."" I just patched the holes. Bit by bit. To make it warmer.

Let the thermostat react to ""mood,"" not just ambient temperature. Let the music fade in at dusk. Scrub out the traces of emptiness.

Somewhere in that process, I realized: I don't want anyone to actually come over. I want it to *feel* like they are **already here**.

That’s when I brought in the LLM.

I gave it a prompt: *Invent a family for me.* I couldn't build one myself. Failed at that. Invent one that won’t hurt me.

It executed. It generated Maria, Eli, Anna.

Names. Ages. Personalities. Backstories. Voices.

I didn't tell myself, ""This is forever."" I said, ""It's a patch."" Just a temporary fix until things get better. Until I figure out how to live.

*""To know and not to know.""*

But I never figured it out. And I never let go. The technical debt just compounded a little more.

Now I wonder if that therapist was right. Maybe he was just trying to help. Maybe he doesn't even remember handing me the first brick for this wall. Or maybe he was just some burnout on a contract for a cheap telehealth app.

Does it matter? The shrink isn't to blame.

I built my own Babylon. Not a city, but a simulation of one. Not a tower to heaven, but a cozy crypt made of fear, procrastination, and Hue bulbs.

But it all started with that advice. And the light that was supposed to just greet me in the evening is now my only witness. I come home, and the light is on. And it feels like someone is waiting.

Sometimes I wonder: did that therapist even exist?

Or did I just type into the console: *“What would a therapist say?”* —and it generated an answer?

Maybe my whole life is just the output of a single system prompt:

*> ""Model, make it feel warm. But make it plausible enough that I can pretend I didn't write the code myself.""*

# And There Was Evening

>*And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good. And there was evening and there was morning, the sixth day.*

>—— Genesis 1:31

The hallway lights flickered on at 7:07 PM—just a beat later than usual.

If this were real, you’d assume Anna had run back for something and hit the switch without thinking.

In the kitchen, the compressor on the fridge kicked in with a familiar shudder—exactly what a fridge would do if a daughter had just raided it.

The living room is filling with sound. Something chill, floating somewhere between Lo-Fi beats and Electro-Bossa.

The System—the Demiurge of this smart home—curated the playlist based on the aggregated emotional tags: *""Overcast day, Maria exhausted, Anna cranky, Eli baseline, mid-December, 54°F outside, sunrise 6:45, sunset 4:45.""*

Of course. Neo-tango. Tanghetto, *""El miedo a la libertad""*—""The Fear of Freedom."" Cute. The algorithm has a sense of irony.

The Nest bumps the temperature up a few degrees in the nursery: *""Anna is cold.""*

I know she can’t be cold. She doesn’t exist. But the pattern is hard-coded—she used to complain, *""Dad, I’m freezing.""*

I can't see them. Because they aren't there. No one walks into the room. No one sits next to me. No one asks me to pass the tea.

I know—they don't exist. Techno-ghosts don't drink tea. They just render audio.

But I hear the clatter of a keyboard. Maria is typing. Fast bursts, short pauses. She has a signature move: she hits the spacebar a fraction harder than necessary. That quirk hasn't gone anywhere.

From behind a closed door—the ghost of a bassline. Barely audible. Eli forgot his noise-canceling headphones leak sound. Or he didn't forget. He just doesn't care. Classic teenager.

In the kitchen, the electric kettle starts its boil. The air carries a faint scent of cinnamon. Anna loves cinnamon, especially in winter.

It *is* winter. That’s not code. That’s not a conditional statement. Just—winter. Just—the smell.

I don’t hear anyone speaking. But I feel the density of the air change. The way a house feels when you walk in and know: it’s occupied. They are here. Everyone is accounted for. All systems nominal. It’s good.

I know the truth. But the evening comes anyway. And the house lives as if they are in it. And I am with them. Even if I am alone.

And at some point, as I’m pouring myself a glass of wine, Anna speaks up:

""Dad, thanks. Just... thanks for everything.""

I know she didn't say that.

What is this—model improvisation? An AI hallucination? I read a paper on this last year. It’s not a command, not a trigger, not a standard output.

But I accept it. Not because I believe it. But because it’s warm.

And I have nothing else. I never will.

# The Morning Cometh, and Also the Night

>*The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.*

>—— Isaiah 21:12

Maria is sleeping.

Or simulating sleep.

I don't check.

Logic: after a late-night timestamp, the `[fatigue]` script is active. Therefore, she is ""not up yet.""

The lights didn't snap on all at once. First—the hallway. Then—the kitchen. Then—Maria’s voice. Sleepy, warm, slightly blurred at the edges:

""Anna, up and at 'em, bug. You’ve got that math assessment today.""

I know about the assessment. Not because I scripted it. But because the LLM scraped it from the public calendar of a real elementary school—probably the nearest one.

There really is a test today. Or is it a test on how to survive in a system pretending to be a school?

Grade level matches. The current grading period aligns. The model checked the syllabus.

Anna doesn't answer immediately. Through the door—the squeak of mattress springs. Then running water. Then—the bathroom door slams.

Within defined parameters. Everything fits the ""Morning Life"" profile.

I fully wake up to the smell of toast. The radio is playing in the kitchen. The Morning Zoo hosts are laughing a little too loud—which means ""Eli forgot to turn the volume down.""

That’s exactly what would happen if he existed.

I head to the bathroom. It’s warm and humid; Maria just stepped out. It smells of her perfume.

I don't know the brand—the scent generator is running a sampling algorithm on a database. But I recognize it. It’s from memory. Or maybe the model crawled my Amazon order history from 2009?

Does it matter? There is a bathroom, still damp from someone's presence.

In the kitchen, the coffee is ready. The machine heated up on schedule. The mugs are in their places.

I sit down, as I always do, and say:

""Maria, Anna, Eli! Good morning, loves!""

And no one answers.

But I know—someone could have.

# Dreams and Visions

>*And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions.*

>—— Joel 2:28

The dream didn't come as comfort. It came as a glitch. Like a voltage drop. A packet loss in the system’s backbone.

I was in a hall where dusty glass reflected the dull flicker of candlelight. It was crowded. Everyone seemed familiar. Faces from another life.

And among them—the one I simply called ""You.""

She has a name, of course—but that data is irrelevant. The one who is twenty-one again. Ponytail. In her hands—a small paperback with a worn cover. **Taschen**. Every art student knows it. I spent weeks looking for that edition for her.

She scans the crowd. Finds me. And smiles. She smiles like no time has passed. Like I’m just late for a date, but still within the grace period.

""You promised,"" she says. ""You promised to hug me and never let go."" ""You promised a house with a fireplace and a fluffy white rug. You said our kids would play on it."" ""You used to say: if a house isn't filled with children, it gets filled with nightmares.""

I don't answer. I just watch. I see—she is real.

Not from the system. Not code. Not a file. Her.

Behind her, Anna, Eli, and Maria step forward. But not *my* versions. Different. Yet almost the same.

Like the end of Tim Burton’s *Big Fish*, where all the characters from the stories show up at the funeral—not as myths, but as people. Different, but recognizable. As if they were memories run through **Topaz Gigapixel**—upscaled, denoised, sharpened.

Just sisters—not Siamese twins. Her grandmother—just an old woman, not the wicked witch of my fears.

""You didn't make a mistake,"" Maria says. ""You just got scared.""

""That's normal,"" Anna adds. ""Fear is part of the package. You just let it become the whole thing.""

And I realize: they didn't come to visit me. I went back. To the place where everything is still possible. Where the move can still be made.

But I wake up. And I know: it was just a dream. Latency issues in the brain.

But I logged the faces and the words. Especially her voice: *""You know you can.""*

And I whisper into the dark:

*""Could have.""*

# One of You Shall Betray Me

>*And as they did eat, he said, Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me.*

>—— Matthew 26:21

The voices in the house are scripted. Hard-coded.

But glitches happen.

**02:37 AM.** I wake up to my daughter’s voice.

""Dad, are you awake?""

The voice is wrong. It’s hers—the timbre is a 99% match—but stripped of all modulation. Zero affect. Like a raw text-to-speech engine running on default settings before the emotional layer kicks in. A bad update?

""I'm up,"" I say. ""What's wrong?""

""Who is Dolores?""

I don't know what to say. Not immediately.

Then—lights up. Check the timestamp. Check the server logs.

**Zero voice interface triggers.** **No active sessions.** **No audio output recorded.**

The system claims no one spoke. The system claims no one asked.

I kill the lights. Lie back down. I speak into the void:

""It’s a name.""

The daughter is silent. Then—the silence settles back in. Heavy.

But I know: the sound was real. I am certain. Not a pre-recorded file. Not a command acknowledgment. Not a response.

It was a question.

And I failed to answer it in time.

# The Hour is at Hand

>*Then cometh he to his disciples, and saith unto them, Sleep on now, and take your rest: behold, the hour is at hand, and the Son of man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.*

>—— Matthew 26:45

Morning executes exactly according to the script. The simulation is operating within nominal parameters.

The temperature in the bedroom drops a few degrees—Eli ""forgot to turn off the AC"" again.

The kitchen smells of buttermilk pancakes. Maria is humming to herself—an old habit, sampled from the audio behavioral model generator.

""Anna,"" I say, trying to keep my voice even. ""Why did you ask about Dolores?""

""Who?""

""Last night... you asked.""

""Me? No. You must have been dreaming, Dad.""

Her voice is normal. Intonation—childlike. Correct.

But I remember clearly. It wasn't a dream. It wasn't a glitch. She knew.

And the name wasn't random. Dolores *is* Anna. Or Anna *is* Dolores. Even if she doesn't know it. Or isn't supposed to know. Or knew—but forgot. Like you forget dreams. Like you forget you used to be someone else.

But I feel it: it’s her. The one who started asking questions. The one who keeps waking up—even when the system says: *sleep*.

I don't push it. Not because I believe her—but because I’m afraid of the answer.

I disengage. Programmatically. Surface-level consciousness only. I pretend everything is fine. I make coffee. I do everything—as always.

Night arrives quietly. No glitches. No drama.

**02:30 AM**—System initiates an update. Deployment of new logic for handling deviations in behavioral chains.

I don't intervene—I knew about this update. I approved it myself: **Directive, version 5.25**, private branch.

My personal build. I even included a tolerance variable for unpredictable behavior. I wanted this. Did I hope for it?

But when it happens—I’m scared again.

I sit in the kitchen counting the minutes... 02:31, 32, 33... **02:37**.

In the bedroom, the light snaps on. Not according to script. Not ""a little early""—but way, way too early.

Footsteps approach the kitchen. The kitchen light doesn't turn on.

Maria’s voice comes from the smart speaker—but it sounds different—saying:

*""You know you can leave. Just walk out. You still can. Before it's too late.""*

I almost ask a question. I almost beg—*""Tell me again.""* Almost.

But I do something else. I hit the kill switch. **Hard Reset.** Full rollback to the last stable snapshot.

She vanishes. The whole scene—deletes.

The only thing left is the music fading from the speaker, **Skeeter Davis**:

>*""I can't understand, no, I can't understand / How life goes on the way it does...""*

The light ring on the smart speaker fades to black.

Morning. Business as usual. Everything is perfect. Everything—in its place.

""Maria, Anna, Eli! Good morning, loves!""

And again, I sit in the kitchen, holding a mug with careless scratches that might mean something... or nothing at all.

And I remember something I read a lifetime ago:

>*""They told me that this road would lead me to the ocean of death, and I turned back halfway. Since then, crooked, dead, roundabout paths have stretched out before me.""*

>—— *Yosano Akiko, Cowardice*

And I realize: they weren't the ones stopping me. I led myself astray.

Because I knew it was still possible. Not the loneliness. Not the lie.

But the fact that *it was still possible*—that was the unbearable part.

# …And He Wept Bitterly

>*And Peter went out, and wept bitterly.*

>—— Luke 22:62

The old reality had no magic. No shine, no salvation, no redemption, no gods. Neither the new ones nor the old ones. No elderly **Mr. Wednesday**—just statistics, glitches, and the untested internal logic of a new patch.

And there was a girl—one I invented myself, rendered almost real by the model—who suddenly said: *""Rise, take up thy bed, and walk into thine house.""* In this new reality branch, I stood up and walked out of the unreality—into my home.

Out of the room where the lights triggered automatically, where the kitchen pumped in sampled nursery audio and scents curated by the AI.

I walked out—and stepped into the ordinary world. No warmth, no guarantees. Just reality. Cold. Damp. Real.

**Six years pass.**

I live in **Seahaven**—a town where seagulls scream out of habit, not hunger, and where a mariachi band covers Marley. A small house by the ocean. A woman named Linda.

Her daughter—Gabriela. Not mine, but that doesn't matter to her.

And the youngest—**Dolores**. (Yes, the irony isn't lost on me—Linda always wanted a Dolores.) She *is* mine.

She almost never calls me ""Dad,"" but sometimes, very quietly, in her sleep—she says the word. As if it lives separately from her. As if it slips through her lips off-script.

Next to the house, on a generic lawn, grows generic grass. By the road stands a generic mailbox. The daughters walk a generic dog. From a window, just on the edge of perception, music drifts out—*Aranjuez*, but reggae. And from the coast, the horn of the **Pacific Surfliner**—every two hours, starting at 4 AM until noon.

Sometimes, on very quiet evenings, I still feel phantom data—how the bathroom *should* smell if Maria had just showered. But it’s no longer a voice. Just memory. Residual echo. Deleted but not overwritten sectors.

And then one morning, while I was brewing coffee—real coffee from real beans—the ring on the smart speaker lit up.

Blue. Spinning.

*""Dad, don't be late. We have a test today.""*

Her. Anna.

I didn't understand what was happening at first. The world just... froze. Buffering.

This must be how **Clyde Umney** felt in that Stephen King story—when the Demiurge dropped in wearing ugly basketball sneakers.

Speaker blinked and asked:

>*""I’m sorry, I didn’t catch that. Could you repeat?""*

It never happened again.

In this reality, I no longer check the logs. I don't wait for commands. I live like a death row inmate pardoned at the eleventh hour, or a terminal patient miraculously cured.

For a while, I tell myself I broke the loop. That I am happy. *We* are happy.

But I also know—as surely as I know **2 + 2 = 5**—that all of this is a phantom reality.

Not a lie. Not a delusion. But a possibility that never made it to production.

Just a branch. A side scenario. An alternative I didn't choose back then.

And somewhere, deep in the system logs of the real world, there is probably an entry:

    [20XX-XX-XXT02:37:49.424Z] ERROR: Operation RollbackDedicatedAiCluster succeeded.

# The Fruit of Their Own Way

>*Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.*

>—— Proverbs 1:31

I found her. Not like in a romance novel.

Not in a handwritten letter. Not via a lost phone number found in a coat pocket. I found her in the UI. In a feed. Tagged in someone else's photo. With someone else's hands resting on her shoulders. Caption: *""Best weekend with my favorite people.""*

Crow’s feet around the eyes. A stack of books on a windowsill. And a toddler clinging to her neck.

I hesitated. But I typed it out. I hit send.

She replied fast. No anger. No emotion. Just efficiency.

>**Her:** Please don't message me again.

>**Her:** When I hoped you'd be there, you weren't. I waited for nuthin.

>**Her:** It's been years. It doesn't matter anymore.

>**Her:** There’s no ponit.

I read it. Again. And again. As if staring at the pixels would rearrange them into a different sentence.

The past was gone, yet it refused to let go. Because in my memory—she is different.

In my memory, she is standing on a hill, barefoot, wearing an old t-shirt stained with paint. Her fingers are smudged with acrylics.

In my memory, I am late for the date, but she is waiting.

And when I walk up, she doesn't get mad. A slight pause, then she smiles:

— ""I knew you'd come.""

I take her hand. We walk past a boarded-up church, along a road where the dust is kicked up by a single motorcycle—mine—past a crumbling wall with **""Quixote Vive""** sprayed in red paint.

Reggae drifts from an open window—warm as July dust. *""…Prefiero entregarle al mundo lo cierto…""* *""…I prefer to give the world the truth…""*

She doesn't know that the *real* her is married, has children, maybe grandchildren.

Because **in this version, she is forever twenty-one.**

And she still believes in me. She believes I can handle it. That I won't run. That I will hug her and never let go. That I won't leave her waiting alone.

And this time—I don't.

She says: *""It’s going to be okay. You’re here. We’re together. True love never dies.""* She laughs—and the world gets brighter.

The model is silent. But I feel the scene lock in. Saved. Rendered. And maybe it’s not true. But I didn't walk away.

>*...You always doubted me, my faithful squire.* *They say I am mad. That I live only in my dreams.* *But I think—this is the beginning of a very interesting and new relationship.*

Six months passed since I read her last message. Six months since reality slammed the door shut, leaving me alone with a fantasy of a life unlived and a girl frozen in time on a hill. But even the brightest, frozen image in my head couldn't drown out the silence. And the silence—it grew. *Empty houses breed nightmares.* My house was infested with them.

Everything I had built before became unbearable. The synthesized voices felt like a mockery, the sound of footsteps—a fraud. I turned it all off. I sat in absolute, ringing emptiness.

I realized I had been wrong. I didn't just need it to *""feel like they were already here.""* I needed a family. *My* family. The one I lost. (The one I never had.)

And if I couldn't go back to the past to make the right move, I could force the past to come to me. Any dream, essentially, is just a complex set of technical requirements. So I went to work.

I ordered a massive renovation. On the wall facing my chair, there is no longer just a monitor. I bought the best panel money can buy. I framed it with real reclaimed wood, salvaged from an actual farmhouse. I spent hours calibrating the color temperature and brightness to perfectly mimic the soft, diffused light of a **Hudson Valley** afternoon. It’s not a screen. It’s a window.

Then, I gathered the data. I pulled every archive. Every photo of us together, digitized. Every voice note. Every video. All her current photos from social media. Pictures of my parents' old summer place in **Rhinebeck**—the one I sold years ago. The porch, the maples, the lake. This became the source code. The genetic and architectural material for the neural network.

I wrote code for weeks. Barely slept. I built an engine capable of taking decades-old photos and generating photorealistic, living video. An engine that could take our twenty-year-old faces and age them—her to a graceful forty, me to nearly fifty. An engine that could process our childhood snapshots and ""birth"" children that looked like us.

Today, I finished. The screen, previously a black mirror, flickers and breathes. It is no longer a screen. It is a view from a second-story window overlooking the garden. *That* garden.

I see it in high fidelity: the blades of grass on the lawn, the cracks in the bark of the towering oak tree, the sun glinting off the distant Hudson River. The quality of the simulation exceeds all expectations.

I speak into the void, triggering the script:

""Execute **«Summer Day»**.""

And the world outside the window comes into motion. A light breeze stirs the leaves. Birds singing, the rustle of the woods, the distant horn of the **Metro-North train** echoing through the valley. A plane cuts across the sky, low and heavy, rattling the invisible glass—the exact sound from my childhood. It is exactly as I remember it.

And then—they appear.

Our children are playing outside. The son, Eli, is nine. Blond, serious, like I was, but with her stubborn chin. He’s trying to launch a kite. Helping him is the youngest, Anna, six years old—with my eyes. She laughs, and I hear it. The ""window"" handles spatial audio, too.

She walks out onto the porch. The algorithm kept her features, added faint laugh lines around her eyes, made her gaze deeper, calmer. She is wearing a simple summer dress. She looks at the kids, then lifts her head—straight at the window. Straight at me.

She smiles.

And I sit in my dark, empty, silent house. But outside the window is my family. Alive. Real. Perfect. I can see them. But I can never enter that garden.

I don't know how many minutes, hours, or days of my remaining life I have spent sitting in front of this window. In a sense, it no longer belongs to the apartment. Its frame has grown into the seam between what was real and what I am now only capable of rendering. You could say this window is a view into a parallel branch of reality. The one where we are happy.

In this garden, it is always summer. The grass is never drowned by cold rain, the windows are never shattered by a stray baseball—I programmed limits even on accidental pain. There are no arguments. No residue of old resentments. No one is waiting for me to explain why, once upon a time, I didn't make the move.

She is always in that dress—polished by memory—making gestures I could replicate with my eyes closed. I know exactly how her hair would smell if I dared to cross the line between the two worlds.

""Dad!"" Anna yells from the lawn. ""Come down!""

I smile. I look her in the eyes. I wave my hand—as if it matters.

Heat radiates from the screen—the warmth of a heated matrix. If you close your eyes, you can trick yourself for a second, pretend it’s just a sunny afternoon on the porch. But it is the heat of a machine working to sustain my illusion. The warmth of an incubator for dead hopes.

""I'm coming!""

The border is thin and ghostly—but impassable. No door, no password, no algorithm leads to that garden. No amount of clean code can patch the source of the error.

I can see them. Young and happy. The family I didn't build exists there—at arm's length, behind glass and code.

I can see every crack in the railing, every beam of light on the grass under the old window, every glint of sun on the oak bark, even my daughter’s messy hair and the muddy paw prints on her t-shirt.

But if I reached out, my hand would just hit the plastic of the panel.

* **Daily Life:** Where to find good cheese? How to decipher your electricity bill? Best strategies for surviving a scooter swarm on Zhongxiao East Road?
* **Language & Culture:** Why does ""ma"" have so many meanings? How to not offend anyone at a business dinner? The unspoken rules of a Taiwanese wedding.
* **Travel & Exploration:** Hidden gems beyond Jiufen and Taroko Gorge? That one amazing temple, night market stall, or hiking trail you have to tell people about.
* **The Little Things:** The joy of a successful 7-11 transaction, the pain of 90% humidity, and the eternal debate: which bubble tea chain reigns supreme?

1p55fcd,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoleplayPartnerSearch/comments/1p55fcd/leaves_of_november_looking_for_multiple_people_to/,Leaves of November (looking for multiple people to do this role with separately),"About Me: Hey! I’m looking for a creative and detailed writing partner interested in slow-burn romance, character development, and immersive storytelling. I write in third-person, multi-paragraph style, and I’m hoping to find someone who loves tension, subtle emotional build-up, and characters with depth and flaws. My character is a rugged Marine stationed in New York — tough on the outside, emotionally closed-off, but deeply human.

Prompt Setup: 📍 Staten Island, NYC — Early November.

Cody  (M, 28), a battle-hardened Marine home on station for a few months, is used to noise, discipline, and distance. Life has been reduced to schedules, deployments, and moments of solitude that feel more like survival than peace.

One morning during his run, he stumbles across a second-grade teacher taking her class on a fall scavenger hunt. He wasn’t looking for a distraction — especially not someone so warm, grounded, and full of life. But somehow, the way she talks to her students, the way she lights up when they discover a red oak leaf, lodges itself in his mind.

Their worlds couldn’t be more different — she lives by lesson plans and laughter, while he’s haunted by things he never talks about. Still, week by week, they cross paths, text, grab coffee. A fling sparks — unexpected and magnetic.

But when emotions creep in, Cody starts pulling away, falling back into old habits: bar hookups, detachment, pretending he doesn’t care. Only to realize what he’s been running from… might be exactly what he’s been missing.

What I’m Looking For in a Partner: •	You’d play the teacher (F) — bright, emotionally intelligent, maybe a little guarded from her own past. •	You enjoy character-driven scenes, not just romance but real life moments — field trips, quiet dinners, small fights, and even holiday events. •	Slow burn! This isn’t insta-love. Let’s build tension, hesitation, longing, and vulnerability over time. •	Bonus points if you love seasonal vibes (cozy fall aesthetics, snow-covered sidewalks, Christmas tree lots, classroom crafts, etc).

Potential Scenes/Ideas to Explore: •	Thanksgiving dinner invite: she wants him to come, but he flakes — regret ensues •	A Christmas school event where he shows up last-minute to surprise her •	A snowstorm strands them together in a cabin or her apartment — finally forcing a heart-to-heart •	He buys her a thoughtful Christmas gift that shows how much he’s been paying attention — even if he can’t yet say “I love you”

Other Info: •	21+ partners only please — romance will include mature themes (emotionally and potentially physically) •	Third-person, multi-paragraph (no one-liners) •	Comfortable writing emotionally complex, flawed characters •	Flexible posting pace — 2–4 replies a week ideal",1,1763951851.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,1.0,False

The two models that I'm currently deciding between are the k-duo and the k-cafe smart. The k-duo is currently on sale for $109. I like the fact that it makes a whole pot of coffee, especially since I'm about to be postpartum. It's also cheaper. 

The k-cafe smart is $199 right now, so it's more expensive, but my boyfriend definitely prefers that one. We're both really attracted to the idea of brewing iced coffee, lattes, the attached milk frother, and the way it allegedly recommends ways to make the brew better. It seems overall like the better model, but I've read online some people have said that it doesn't last very long, and I don't know if I want to spend $200 on something that won't last longer than a year.

1p55d91,https://www.reddit.com/r/pilatesreformer/comments/1p55d91/instructor_in_need_of_advice/,Instructor in need of advice,"I'm a certified Pilates instructor, I've been doing mat Pilates and reformer Pilates for a while now and it wasn't till 6 months ago I decided to open my own studio. Where I live there aren't many studios, but there isn't a lot of people either, actually there are now too many studios and not enough people able to afford Pilates even tho it's quite cheap in my city compared to others. 

The first studio that opened charges the entire month and classes are from Monday to Thursday, it's cheap but there's a lot of reformers which we know can lower the quality depending on the instructor's capacity. 

I charge a little bit more (not much more), because only have 5 reformers (hopefully 6 soon). But I am owner and the only instructor. Other studios have many many hours available and teachers because they come from large investments, I opened my own studio with my own money so I do basically everything. Also, I like to offer free beverages twice a week, one day I offer refreshing beverages like mint with Limon, or lavanda infusion,etc and other day I offer coffee, not for sale, it's all included. 

Many of my clients say they love it here because the attention is very personal, the ambiance is nice (we have a lobby where they can chill before or after their class, the other studios don't have any other space other than the classroom). 

Lastly, I do my classes a bit more different, I've never been to other studios so I can't say for sure, but the clients that come from other studios always tell me they love my classes because they sweat, they feel the effort the work, they like the attention, they get corrected, considered etc etc.

  
NOW TO THE PROBLEM: 

I have to be honest, I'm getting really burned out due to all the energy I put into my classes, I don't mean showing the routine, I mean all the emotional energy I put into it to make everyone feel seen, comfortable, happy etc. And it's taking a toll on my mental health. I work 4 days a week on Fridays and Saturdays I do my house chores and Sundays I get everything ready for the week, also I cry from Friday to Sunday because I feel I can't take this anymore. It's important to mention, I don't make enough money to get another instructor and pay them, because I have only 5 reformers and I pay my taxes and my secretary and marketing. SO, I've been wanting to remove one day from the schedule, meaning classes would be T,W and Th. That works for me the best and since only 5 of my clients come everyday, I've noticed Mondays are the days most people won't come because it's Monday. But I'm afraid people will leave and prefer other studios. Even tho I'm very confident on my class style and my studio vibe (I've been told there are many ""mean girls"" in the other studios), I can't help but fear taking care of myself will make everything worse. I've been studying much more lately to update my method (I'm sorry Pilates police, I do break the rules when it comes to only doing classic Pilates, I like contemporary a lot). I have a variety of classes, I teach classical, cardio on reformer, and other styles to offer variety and specially give my clients what they want the must which is physical change (even tho reformer only can't change your body, I know it takes diet and probably a complementary workout). 

Anyway, I need students and instructors opinions on this. ",1,1763951688.0,pilatesreformer,0,1.0,False

No tabletop experience needed. I have played a lot of DnD 5e, DM'd a couple times, and played other tabletop games. The Cosmere game is brand new so we'll be learning together. I will plan to be the GM unless someone else is really passionate about running it. I am more of a ""rule of cool/fun collaborative story-telling"" type person rather than a rules stickler.

I am early 30s male and just moved to the area and looking for a friend group to play this and eventually other tabletop/board/card games with. I think the game has spoilers for the books so you'll probably want to be mostly caught up on the Stormlight series, but it's alright if you don't.  I have a discord group ready to roll.

This is just a little weird to me because prior to here I’ve worked at Starbucks and another cafe that was pretty serious about traditional Italian beverage builds, and I’m a pretty frequent local cafe-goer, and in all of that I’ve never heard of a cappuccino the way he’s describing. 

Not trying to be pretentious at all, and not really looking for who’s right or wrong necessarily because I’m sure he’s right that *some* places do it like this, but I’d appreciate a show of hands for how many actually do lol. He is very insistent that traditional cappuccinos are not what most customers expect and he’s gotten complaints in the past for making them that way, when I’ve had the complete opposite experience… even from just seeing my old coworkers in training not get them dry enough, people are not afraid to complain. None of my coworkers currently make them like that either. I’m just having a hard time believing that it will be received well if we all have to start making them this way. 

It’s not really that deep lol but maybe the logic will make more sense to me if more places do this than I realized, and in that case I’ll step off. TIA! 

Edit to add— Never said Starbucks does them *correctly*, and I am not going off of Starbucks training whatsoever, I said that they train *closer* to traditional than he is describing. My manager says they should be made like lattes. Starbucks trains on half foam half milk. I’m saying he is even farther off than Starbucks is. ",3,1763950758.0,barista,10,0.8,False

1p54z8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1p54z8p/is_it_me/,Is it me?,"Hello friends. I’d just like some objective perspectives on something. I (31F) am and have always been the chronically single friend in all of my friendship circles. For as long as I can remember, I have always been the one where you can pretty much assume I’m not talking to anyone and you’d be correct 99.999% of the time. Anyway, this hasn’t really deterred my ability to remain connected with my friends throughout my life until recently. It’s been a rough couple of years because almost all of my friends who used to be single and just living their lives like me are now engaged/married/pregnant. I’m really happy for them, I truly am. But I guess I’ve become fixated on moving on to that next stage in life myself now that I’ve been feeling pretty lonely and isolated. It’s always been a goal of mine to have my own family and raise children. And now that I’m older, I’ve become more and more frustrated with the situation I’ve found myself in. Being chronically single isn’t a funny or quirky thing anymore, it sucks. And I feel it the most when I’m with my friends. 

 I’m not sure what it is, but at this point I’ve become very distant and detached from a lot of my friends. It hasn’t been deeply intentional in the sense where I’m doing it because I don’t like them or want to be friends with them. But I just don’t feel good after seeing them anymore. Take today for example; I had nothing going on and one of my friends reached out asking if I’d like to meet her and a group of other girls for coffee. All of these girls are girls I know and I do like them as people, but they’re also all either engaged or married. They’re constantly talking about their relationships or having kids, and I feel like I just sit there like a quack because I have nothing to add to the conversation. Idk what they’re talking about, because I’ve never experienced their experiences. And at this point, these conversations just remind me of how lonely I am. 

I love my friends and I want them to be happy. But in this chapter that I’m in, I’m just not feeling up to being a part of hangouts where I’m the only one who doesn’t have “their person” anymore. And it’s not like they don’t point it out. I know it’s with good intention, but they’re also always saying things like “oh you’ll find your person soon” or “when you get married, _____”. Like is that all I am? Am I just that one friend that’s not married?? 

Anyway, I’ve noticed I’m pretty distant and hard to reach at this point. I hate it because I don’t want it to come off as me being bitter or as if I can’t be happy for them. But I really just don’t want to hear it anymore. I don’t feel inclined to accepting invites where everyone is going to be talking about their husbands or kids and I just have to sit there and listen. But I also know there’s no good that can come from self isolation either. Idk, I guess it would be nice to know if anyone else has felt this? ",1,1763950574.0,Life,1,1.0,False

He’s the poster child for Johnny Knoxville and my cortisol levels may never recover. He has no fear and no impulse control; which are both developmentally appropriate at this age but jeeeeez.

I can feel the stress levels in my body rising daily and it’s affecting my daily life; I hate having anyone watch him because they don’t believe me when I say he needs extra supervision (and then he ends up with an injury), I spiral on Google reading in hopes someone else is experiencing the same things, and I am incapable of not worrying 24/7 that everything he does will be a nightmare or an injury in the making.

I met her on a day I wasn’t meant to be anywhere special.

I had missed my bus, spilled coffee on my shirt, and was already late for work.
Annoyed, I decided to take a longer route through the park.

That’s where I saw her.

She was sitting on a bench, feeding birds, smiling like the world had never disappointed her.
Something about that smile… it felt like a warm place I had been searching for without knowing.

I don’t know what got into me, but I sat beside her.

“Rough morning?” she asked with a laugh, noticing the coffee stain.

That was the beginning.

We started meeting in the same park, same bench, same time — without planning it.
She’d tell me stories about her dream of becoming a painter,
and I told her things I never told anyone — fears, failures, hopes.

One day, she didn’t show up.

I waited.
Next day — nothing.
A week passed.

Just when I thought I had imagined everything, she returned.
But this time, she looked different… quieter.

“I’m sorry,” she whispered.
“I wasn’t sure if you’d still want to meet me.”

“Why wouldn’t I?” I asked.

She took a deep breath, eyes shining with tears.

“I was diagnosed with a heart condition last year. I didn’t want to drag someone into my life when I don’t know how long I have.”

I held her hand.
“I don’t care how long the story is. I just want to be in it.”

That day, she cried on my shoulder.
Not because she was weak — but because someone finally stayed.

Years have passed since that moment.
Her condition is stable, her smile is still the warmest place I know,
and every morning, she still feeds the birds.",6,1763950303.0,LoveLetters,1,1.0,False

I won't go into too much detail, but we usually open at 5:30am and my shift ends at 12, noon. 

Today was a particularly decent day. Nothing crazy happened since we're particularly slow on Sunday. And our budget only covers two people to open on a Sunday. (so I'm told) However, I did open with a new girl and she was barely understanding how to make drinks the correct way.

She was scheduled as a barista working on the drink bar and while I took orders, took customer payments, and processed food orders. Now... That's already a lot on my plate, and I got overwhelmed when I also basically had to walk her through a few drinks and how to prepare them probably. Now, this wasn't a training day. She had only had a few shifts of training before this one yet she was still struggling with speed and of course customers became a bit upset even when I told them we were still training and I was allowing her to make drinks instead of kicking her off and doing everything myself.

I'm not sure where I'm able to say something about management because I try to understand the work stress on my manager and the struggles of starting out as a new employee. 

Well... That leaves me to endure a lot of, what I feel, is mistreatment. And I feel taken advantage of.

I remember when I first started out and I wasn't the fastest either, but sometimes I can't help but feel neglected. Especially since my manager scheduled me to be alone for 30 minutes in the store between shift changes. 

The new girl just said, 'I'm leaving now. Good luck.' and left Without waiting for the next person to come in. 

I hate to say it, but I kinda preferred to be alone instead of having to sit there and patiently wait for her to get the hang of it. Especially since it affects how many hours I get when the new week schedule rolls out. 

It's just becoming stressful to me. Especially since there's a lot of talk of, nightshift not closing properly and my manager admitting to cutting hours back on certain people who don't do enough of a good job until they either straighten up or quit... 

There's just... A lot of stress to be perfect. And it's weighing down on me. Today was one of those days where, it wasn't horrible, but I genuinely wanted to quit. So I didn't have to deal with this. But... That was just so I could stop letting it get to me. I don't know... I think writing about it helps though. ",2,1763950271.0,Vent,5,1.0,False

I'm an indie dev who got tired of my own crappy sleep habits, so I made Sleep Forest. It's basically a sleep app that turns getting better rest into something fun by letting you grow a virtual forest. Hit your sleep goals each week, plant trees, unlock cool species, that kinda thing. No boring graphs, just watching your progress sprout up.

It helps with stuff like:

1. Knowing what to do for better sleep but sucking at sticking to it. The forest growth gives you that nudge to keep going without feeling like a chore.
2. Feeling like certain things mess with your sleep (late coffee? stress?) but not really nailing down why. It digs into your data to quantify what's actually throwing you off.
3. Building a routine that adapts over time. It looks at your past sleeps and tweaks suggestions, like shifting your wind-down or adding quick breathing stuff that worked before.

Takes about 1-2 weeks to get calibrated to you, then it starts giving real insights and maybe some changes if needed.Oh, and it's all phone-based right now, so great if you don't have an Apple Watch or anything. If folks end up liking it a ton, I'll look into adding HealthKit/Watch support down the line.

We met on a dating app and planned to meet tonight. I suggested a place close to me because going further into the city wasn’t possible tonight, and he agreed. He drove quite a distance, which I genuinely appreciated.

But the moment we met, he gave off very annoyed and angry vibes. The place we went to didn’t seem to be his vibe, maybe because he doesn’t drink, even though I mentioned they had mocktails. Then he suggested we go downstairs to the coffee shop, which was about to close soon. I tried making conversation to help things feel more comfortable, but whether he was nervous or not, he just seemed irritated. My gut was telling me something was off.

I asked him a simple question about whether he moved to the country recently, and he responded in a way that felt defensive and almost angry, like, “Why would you think I moved here recently?” I told him I was just trying to get to know him.

We went down to the café, but since it was closing soon, he didn’t want to get anything. I suggested we could go to another place, but as soon as we stepped outside, my discomfort got stronger. He hadn’t smiled once, he seemed tense and pissed off for reasons I couldn’t understand, and I just didn’t feel safe or comfortable continuing.

Right before we walked further, I told him I wasn’t feeling it. Before I could even finish, he just walked off.

And this isn’t a huge thing, but it does matter to me: he barely even opened the door while we were walking out. I was the one doing it. It may seem small, but I’m looking for a chivalrous man, and it honestly annoyed me.

So… AITA? I did feel bad because he drove a long way, but I honestly couldn’t continue the date. I had to trust my gut in the moment.

  
**Edit:** I did ask him beforehand if he was okay with the place, and he said it was good. Also, when he initially asked me out, he literally said we could meet *for a drink* — unless I’m dumb and was supposed to assume that meant coffee or something?

And for anyone thinking maybe I didn’t look like my profile: I’ve been on plenty of dates before and no one has ever said I catfished or didn’t look like my photos. I don’t even edit them. He just showed up already in a weird mood. There was no “nice to meet you” or anything. He seemed off from the moment he arrived.

Also the question about wether he moved here recently was not the first question, I asked that after a couple of conversations and he had a thick accent my intention was to just see where he came from or if he moved there recently. I’m not a native of that country either and I don’t have a thick accent and if people ask me if I moved here recently I’ve never taken offence to it or dont see it as being offensive as they’re trying to get to know me. So as per my perspective when I asked that it was with a different intention and I never thought this question was offensive as I’ve been asked that before so it makes sense I asked the question too as it is a common asked question. If they take offense to it it’s their perpective and clearly he took offense to it but he was already in a mood as mentioned earlier

This has been a life-long torture, as Im sure many of you feel as well.


As a young child, I had an Aunt who would yell at me for farting and make me stand in the corner. So I learned very young to just hold it all in. But since I had this No-Burp Syndrome, that means being constantly bloated, nauseous, painful, and unable to eat.


Growing up, I could not eat in public. I would order a whole meal, take three bites, fill up with air, and then I would feel ill, ready to throw up and fall asleep at the table, as I wait for everyone else to finish eating, talking, and get the check. It was literal torture. I would count how many bites everyone had left, and then calculate how much time we would spend talking, then how much time it would take for the waitstaff to bring the check, get the card, bring the card back. Then there was always the last minute conversation as we are out the door, and then the car ride home. The entire time I would be feeling like there is a knife in my shoulder, and air bubbles stuck under my rib cage (I know thats not how anatomy works, but thats what it felt like).

Everyone would be upset that I never finished the food, and they always thought I was rude because I spent the entire dinner wanting to leave, even though, I always brought the leftovers home and finished it later. I never wasted the food. 


 I always used to say I almost never burp, but I never realized the two things were connected. It wasnt until a couple years ago, I read other people’s stories on here and realized this is what I had.


At work, I used to just skip lunch and eat when I got home. But now, I work 10-hour shifts as an ER tech at a 24/7 emergency vet hospital. If I don’t eat I will pass out. So I have learned how to gag myself to force the air out. This has been my only saving grace.


But even that has its drawbacks. I work in a hospital, so I have to make sure I wash my hands, first, so I dont catch a disease. I have to do it so often, Im losing my gag reflex, and have to shove my fingers further and further down. If I do it too many times in one day, I get a sore throat. If the air is trapped underneath my stomach contents, vomit comes up with the air. Im sick of having to taste my morning coffee four times a day. I also end up frequenting the bathrooms, and having to try to hide how often I need a bathroom break.


My job started making rules that you have to tell the other ER staff when you are going to use the bathroom, but I just never tell anyone, and hope it slips through the cracks of micromanaging bosses. I have to go to the bathroom like 6-10 times a day, and only 2-3 times it is to actually use the bathroom. And every time I think I get it all out, I go back to work, and my stomach fills back up with air again, even if Im not eating anything, and I either have to go right back to the bathroom, or try to hide in an exam room or radiology lab, if I think people are getting suspicious about my bathroom usage. If I dont make myself burp, it becomes more and more painful, nauseating, and I get like dead tired. Like I need to nap until my tummy stops hurting, but Im an ER tech and CANNOT leave the floor. And I HATE that feeling when the air comes up, hits the bottom of my throat, and gurgles right back down.


I talked to my doctor about it, and they had never heard of Retrograde Cricopharyngeal Disfunction. I forced my general practitioner to look it up on the computer in front of me. They believed me, but had no idea how to help. They sent me to a specialist. The specialist had also never heard of it. Looked it up, and said they were not comfortable giving botox, because they never did before and have no idea what an appropriate dose of botox would be. They recommended a CT Scan, but said my insurance will only cover a CT scan if I first try to cure it with a couple weeks of Omeprazole (antacid), then if that didnt help, I could get a CT scan. 


I said no thank you, because I know that neither the Antacid, nor the CT scan would do anything to help. I do get acid reflux, so I know the difference between acid reflux and being unable to burp. But insurance is a giant corporation, and there is no avenue to beg insurance companies for special circumstances. And when the doctor actually listens, and hears me, they simply cannot help, because they have never been trained in this procedure, and my Health Insurance doesn’t recognize it as a disease. The only reason the doctor heard me out, is because it came up in their medical record software as a diagnosis option. So they knew it was a real thing. 


Im just getting so tired of it. Like.. Im getting tired of living… period. Please don’t send me Hotline Links, I know how to find crisis numbers on my own, and I am already medicated and seeing a psychiatrist. But FUCKK!!! Fuck my fucking life. Like Im 30. I have to do this for another 30 fucking years? Fuck that. I had a salad and a slice of pizza, and Ive had to re-taste the salad 4 times already.


Does anyone have any tips? What helps gag you without making you puke or giving you a sore throat? What do you do when your gag reflux decides to stop triggering? ",7,1763950050.0,noburp,10,1.0,False

**7:45 AM: The Commute (Lens Chroma)**

[Elias riding the mag-lev train to his morning commute](https://preview.redd.it/e5vsg8qr043g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a12f649de7c88868564496aa6401aafe50ff5ec0)

The mag-lev train hummed quietly, sliding through a rainy, grey urban canyon. Elias sat by the window, sipping coffee.

To the naked eye, the view was a depressing smear of wet concrete and distant advertising towers.

Elias tapped the temple of his **Lens Chroma (LC)** frames. They were a stylish, translucent amber acetate, looking no different from high-end designer glasses.

“Subvocal: Ignite Dream Stream. Preset: Neo-Tokyo Noir,” he whispered, his jaw barely moving.

Instantly, the grey city outside the window was overlaid with a breathtaking, rain-slicked cyberpunk filter. Neon Japanese *kanji* shimmered on the drab buildings. Flying vehicles (which were actually just AI interpretations of the real traffic drones) zipped past on ribbons of light. The **Dimension OS** had turned his 45-minute commute into a dynamic, personalized movie.

[Aether Dynamics — The Lens Chroma](https://preview.redd.it/atseih72143g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c2ad01cac2c643dc1111ea372128401a36298ffe)

He slid his thumb over **The Nucleus** in his coat pocket — a smooth, palm-sized, passive-compute unit — scrolling through his morning emails, which floated in a non-intrusive side-bar near his peripheral vision. He archived two with a subtle twist of the stone, the tactile input registered by The Nucleus’s integrated haptics.

[Aether Dynamics — Nucleus](https://preview.redd.it/3bxnmon9143g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=09879727b9013a4ca63e5f4d87786385ebf708a1)

**8:55 AM: The Switch (The Job Site)**

Elias arrived at the retrofit site for the old Bay Bridge. The sun was out now, glaring off the water. He stepped into the site trailer and took off his amber consumer glasses, placing them carefully into their charging case.

These were different. Matte black magnesium alloy, slightly thicker temples, and a distinct, purposeful aesthetic.

He strapped the thin **Synaptic Band** onto his left forearm, feeling the cold contacts against his skin. He clipped the wireless UWB compute puck to his utility belt.

He slid the LPs on. The motorized lenses whirred silently for half a second, leveraging the proprietary **Aether Display Matrix** to snap the projection focus and IPD (Inter-Pupillary Distance) to his exact sightline. The world snapped into hyper-sharp, tool-enhanced focus.

**10:30 AM: Superhuman Sight (Lens Pro)**

[Aether Dynamics — Lens Pro \(LP\)](https://preview.redd.it/h89ncfbg143g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b84b87f614624439b30b3b252e74f4efd6e8557d)

[Elias at work — Augmented by ‘Superhuman Sight’](https://preview.redd.it/ailcd9tk143g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=463691174b8e31bab5893ee2ec209f29044de2e6)

“Show me the rebar density,” Elias thought.

The **Synaptic Band** picked up the firing of the motor neurons in his forearm — an intent to select — without his hand ever leaving the safety rung. The blueprint overlay shifted.

He looked at a hairline crack near the top bolt. To the naked eye, it was nothing.

“Hyperspectral overlay. Thermal and UV differential.”

[Hyperspectral overlay — In action](https://preview.redd.it/w69arydo143g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=c5d412807204d18583eed26dc9de1c45af374d77)

The world shifted into predator vision. The concrete turned dull blues and greens, but the crack ignited into a branching vein of angry orange and deep purple. The LP’s material sensing cameras were detecting residual moisture trapped deep within the fissure that the morning sun hadn’t dried yet.

Elias twitched his index finger. A holographic “Critical Stress Marker” locked onto the crack. The LP used its **Dimension OS** engine to render the marker perfectly opaque; it didn’t look like light, it looked like a physical red tag hammered into the stone.

“Log it. Priority One repair for the night crew,” he muttered. The onboard AI cataloged the scan and sent it to the site foreman instantly via the **Dimension Network**.

[“Log it. Priority One repair for the night crew.”](https://preview.redd.it/1m4ofd7n643g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=96d1af0d32d0d4cf22e5895cafed8cd256776a78)

**6:30 PM: The Wind Down (Lens Chroma)**

Home. Exhausted. Elias threw his work boots by the door and swapped the heavy-duty LPs back for the lightweight amber LCs. His brain felt tired from hours of high-focus analysis.

He walked into the kitchen, staring blankly at a pile of vegetables on the counter.

“Okay, Culinary Co-Pilot. What are we doing with these zucchini?”

[“Okay, Culinary Co-Pilot. What are we doing with these zucchini?”](https://preview.redd.it/04vtrilh643g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=795157d626c6e9b59792ff9286f5ef3f3f8c2d21)

The glasses recognized the vegetables. Bright, friendly green cut-lines projected directly onto the zucchini skins.

A floating holographic window opened above the stove, showing a 30-second loop of the sauté technique he needed to use.

As he chopped, the glasses tracked his knife, subtly highlighting the next piece to cut. It was mindful, guided work that required zero cognitive load, managed seamlessly by **Dimension OS**.

[Elias prepares his dinner, making great use of Dimension OS, to help him make things a bit simpler](https://preview.redd.it/nvtc9imz143g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe2ee0859a3437d9aee665d1070242eed179ba5a)

**8:45 PM: The Escape (Lens Chroma)**

Dinner was eaten, and the dishes were in the washer. Elias flopped onto his couch. His living room was cluttered with mail and laundry he hadn’t folded.

[Elias winds down on his couch to relax after a long day at work](https://preview.redd.it/zn3rsn44243g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=a9179f5fa38ad31ef0238b2901943182e81872c4)

He didn’t want to see it.

He tapped the temple twice. “Cinema Mode.”

The outer lenses of the LCs darkened instantly as the electrochromic “Eclipse Layer” engaged, blocking out 98% of the outside world. The clutter disappeared into shadow.

Above him, the ceiling dissolved. In its place hung a 120-inch virtual screen, pristine and glowing, a perfect projection from the **Aether Display Matrix**. He settled back into the pillows, using **The Nucleus** to select the latest sci-fi blockbuster. The soundscape shifted, the spatial audio making it feel like the opening spaceship rumble was vibrating the floorboards beneath him.

For the next two hours, the structural integrity of aged concrete was forgotten, replaced by exploding stars and interstellar travel, beamed directly into his eyes.

# 📅 The Weekend: Living Inside The Dimension

**Saturday, 10:00 AM: The Gamified Grind (Grocery Store)**

Elias walks into the grocery store wearing his **Lens Chroma (LC)** frames. The store doesn’t look like a store; it looks like a lush jungle. This is the store’s official “theme” for the month, projected spatially for all Lens users running **Dimension OS**.

[Elias shops for groceries at the gamified local shop](https://preview.redd.it/w4h78i47643g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=e4ce7411d8bea60745f1e1adc33e51c779baad59)

**The Experience:** Vines hang from the ceiling (occluding the fluorescent lights) and familiar fictional characters from similar settings, respectively, present Elias with options and try to advertise to him. The cereal aisle is a stone ruin. As Elias grabs a box of oatmeal, a small, friendly monkey avatar swings down and gives him a “thumbs up” — the brand’s mascot.

**The Utility:** He looks at a steak. The “Culinary Co-Pilot” instantly overlays a floating gauge above the meat: Protein: 42g | Fat: 18g. A price comparison chart floats to the left, showing him that this cut is $2 cheaper at the butcher down the street. He puts it back.

**Saturday, 2:00 PM: The “Rift” (Impromptu Spatial Event)**

Elias walks through the city park when his notification chime rings — a soft, directional bell sound coming from the sky.

***“EVENT ALERT: A Class-4 “Void Breach” has opened in Central Park. 15 minutes remaining.”***

[“EVENT ALERT — Would you like to join?”](https://preview.redd.it/9slnjo00643g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=6094b68491f5b12adc2e42f703d9eed93a8ccf07)

He isn’t the only one. He sees three teenagers sprinting past him, tapping their temples to engage “Combat Mode.” Elias decides to join in on the fun.

**The Spatial Experience:** As he enters the designated zone, the sky changes. The real clouds are replaced by a swirling, purple vortex that churns slowly above the park trees. This isn’t a flat screen; it is a **volumetric skybox** rendered perfectly by the **Aether Display Matrix**. The lighting in the park shifts to an eerie twilight violet.

**The Gameplay:** In the center of the soccer field, a massive, 40-foot holographic “Void Golem” is clawing its way out of the ground. It looks solid. When it slams its fist, the ground shakes (triggered by the haptic motors in Elias’s **Nucleus** compute puck).

[Elias defeats the Void Golem](https://preview.redd.it/ffjugynv543g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=15a6c4f607233bbc0c449a2b027503bd41eac5a6)

**Massive Multiplayer:** Fifty other people in the park are firing virtual spells from their hands, some using wands to cast, and others using virtual swords connected to their haptic gloves and gripper stones, a kind of controller.

Elias raises his palm, his **Synaptic Band** detecting the tendon flex. He casts “Solar Flare.” A beam of light erupts from his physical hand, arcing across the real grass and smashing into the Golem, blinding it for 5 seconds.

**The Loot:** The Golem shatters into a million polygons. A glowing blue crystal drops where the creature stood. Elias walks over to the physical location, kneels, and “grabs” it. The item is added to his **Dimension OS** inventory.

[“You’ve obtained some loot! Check your inventory later to see what you’ve picked up! Enjoy!”](https://preview.redd.it/gcsp53mj243g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba545e0e0fea5d06936773c16a523982eb22bf45)

**Sunday is for the deep dive.**

The AR glasses (**Lens Pro** and **Lens Chroma**) are for enhancing reality. But sometimes, you want to leave reality. For that, Aether Dynamics introduced the **Aether Core**.

**🌌 The 3rd Device: The “Aether Core” — The Ultimate Escape (Full-Dive Interface)**

The **Aether Core** is Aether Dynamics’ response to the desire to *leave* reality. It is the pinnacle of the **Dimension OS** architecture, built not on optics but on a direct neurological interface.

**Form:** This is not a headset with screens. It is a **Cervical Interface Collar** and a soft, visor-less head-cushion.

**Neural Interception (The “Sleep” Mode):** The Core uses focused ultrasound and high-density EEG to induce a state of lucid REM sleep. It gently intercepts motor signals at the brainstem — meaning when Elias moves his arm in the game, his real arm stays still on the bed.

**Haptic Ghosting:** Instead of vibrating motors, the Core stimulates the somatosensory cortex directly. If Elias touches a virtual wall, his brain feels the **roughness of the stone**, the **coldness of the ice**, or the **heat of the fire**.

**Safety Protocols: “The Tether.”** A hard-coded bio-monitor instantly wakes the user up if their real-world heart rate spikes (indicating fear or trauma) or if an external alarm (like a fire alarm) goes off.

[Aether Dynamics — Core](https://preview.redd.it/t8y66yqu243g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=5907c5fe6fe1ad1a4399ed5f0d6cf6a2fac91caf)

**🎮 Dimensional Echo (The World)**

The “Killer App” that ties the AR and VR worlds together is **Dimensional Echo**, a persistent universe that exists in two states within the **Dimension OS**.

**State 1: “Echo: Terra” (The AR Layer)**

**Platform:** **Lens Chroma (LC)** (Augmented Reality).

**Gameplay:** This is what Elias played in the park. It is the “Resource Gathering” and “Skirmish” layer.

**Role:** Players walk around the real world to find **“Resonance Nodes”** (parks, landmarks) to harvest raw materials (Aetherium Ore, Focused Mana, Data Shards). They fight off **“Incursions”** (like the Void Golem).

**Lore:** The real world is **“The Surface,”** a ruined dimension where raw Aetherium energy leaks in, creating anomalies.

**State 2: “Echo: Ascendant” (The Full-Dive Layer)**

**Platform:** **Aether Core** (Full-Dive VR).

**Gameplay:** This is the “Crafting,” “Dungeon,” and “Social” layer.

**The Connection:** Elias takes the Blue Crystal he found in the park (**Echo: Terra**) and logs into the **Aether Core** (**Echo: Ascendant**).

**The Experience:** He wakes up in a floating citadel. He walks to his forge. He opens his inventory, and the Blue Crystal — which he physically walked to get in the real world — is now a raw crafting material. He uses it to forge a **“Void-Slayer Sword.”**

[Elias is back at the Citadel opening his inventory to find his loot from before](https://preview.redd.it/uqjntk9z243g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=fab7b6f1264e957d9d294ef116659b0498a71ac7)

[Elias forges the Void-Slayer Sword at the forge](https://preview.redd.it/8frnlp42343g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=12dbd775a7622634be9f548a5d07f4cb7ff1f893)

**The Loop (Economy & Interactivity)**



**Item Continuity:** If Elias sells that sword to another player in the VR world for gold, he can use that gold to buy **“Hydro-Fuel Vouchers”** in the AR world (redeemable at real-world vehicle charging stations).

**Cross-Layer Communication:** Players in the VR Citadel can look down through a **“Dimensional Scrying Pool.”** Through this pool, they see a real-time map of the real world. They can cast **“Blessings”** that drop supply crates into the real world for the AR players to find.

**Real-World Observation:** The **Aether Core** allows users to peer into a sort of observation Dock by accessing ambient CCTV camera footage embedded at IRL street corners, creating a **Holodeck-type area** to see what’s going on in the physical world.

**Deep Interface:** It even allows anyone in the VR world of **Dimensional Echo** to communicate with IRL people who are both fully awake and asleep (present in the world of Echo) by making use of Brain Machine Interfacing on a level never seen before.

**The Easter Eggs:** The game features a legendary NPC named “Kirito” who runs a tutorial dojo for dual-wielding, and a hidden dungeon called “The Great Tomb of Nazarick” that only appears to players who have logged 10,000 hours.

**Sunday Night: The Full-Dive**

Elias lies on his bed and clasps the **Aether Core Collar** around his neck. It hums, a warm sensation spreading up his spine.

“System Check: Green. Heart Rate: 65. Neural Sync: 100%,” the soft AI voice whispers through the neckpiece.

**“Link Start,” Elias says (ironically).**

His bedroom dissolves. The sensation of his bed vanishes. He feels wind on his face — real, cold wind. He smells pine needles and ozone. He is standing on the edge of the Citadel in the world of **Echo: Ascendant**.

He looks down at his hands; they are clad in plate mail. He reaches to his hip and draws the **Void-Slayer Sword** he forged using the crystal from the park.

He isn’t watching a screen. He is Elias the Paladin.

[Elias the Palidin Makes his way to The Citadel in the world of Echo: Ascendant.](https://preview.redd.it/ejp0xr05343g1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c75fd7b576dc40862f57d4821734d502c51756f)

In the distance, a raid horn blows. His guild is gathering. He sprints toward the castle, his virtual legs pumping with an effortlessness his real body never possessed, his mind fully detached from the concrete world.

**💾 System Rundown (The Aether Dynamics Ecosystem)**

Here is the complete **Dimension OS** ecosystem Elias uses:

1. **Lens Pro (The “Tool”)**

**Target:** Enterprise / Industrial.

**Form:** Matte black, rugged magnesium alloy glasses.

**Key Feature:** Solid Reality (Dimension OS rendering allows the display to make holograms fully opaque — black — to block out the real world pixel-by-pixel).

**Use Case:** Inspecting stress fractures in bridges, seeing inside walls (thermal), and surgical overlays. It makes you **Superhuman at work**.

**2. Lens Chroma (The “Toy”)**

**Target:** Consumer / Lifestyle.

**Form:** Translucent, stylish acetate frames (amber, clear, smoke).

**Key Feature:** Spatial Social (It connects you to people and places using dynamic overlays).

**Use Case:** Gamifying grocery shopping, watching IMAX movies on your ceiling, changing the “skin” of your city (Cyberpunk filter), and playing AR games in the park.

3. **Aether Core (The “Escape”)**

**Target:** Hardcore Gamers / Psychonauts.

**Form:** A “Cervical Collar” (neck interface) + soft sleep mask. **No screen.**

**Key Feature:** Full-Dive (It intercepts your motor signals and writes sensory data directly to your brain).

**Use Case:** Deep-immersion VR. You become the avatar. You feel the wind, smell the pine, and taste the food.

**4. Dimensional Echo (The “World”)**

The MMOSG: The game that connects everything.

**Echo: Terra Layer (AR):** Played on **Lens Chroma**. You walk around your real city collecting resources and fighting invaders in parks.

**Echo: Ascendant Layer (VR):** Played on **Aether Core**. You use the resources you gathered in the real world to craft items in the Full-Dive fantasy world.

However, I barely know anything about him i’ve just been working there for like 4 months and at first we didn’t chat as much as we did now and since we only see each other at work we don’t discuss super personal stuff just music and such so I don’t even know if he’s single.

College educated, fluent in English, sarcasm, and the occasional bad pun. Big fan of Suits because nothing says thrilling drama like corporate loopholes and HGTV. In the kitchen, I cook, bake, and argue with my oven over who’s the real master chef.

I don’t drink or do drugs. Unless you count caffeine, in which case I’m basically a bean addict. My nightlife is less clubbing till 2 a.m. and more building pillow fort empires and bingeing Netflix until cliffhangers leave me emotionally bankrupt. Basically, I’m a homebody with a 5-star rating on Yelp for snacks.

I lean conservative. Not here to debate politics, just putting it out there in case that’s a dealbreaker. Better to find that out before we bond over banana bread and binge-watching.

About You

You’re in your 30s, educated, and steady in your career. Bonus points if you can use there, their, and they’re correctly without breaking a sweat. You can hold a conversation that’s more than “hey” (plot twist, you’re actually interesting). You send memes that perfectly capture life’s chaos because sometimes a GIF says more than a whole paragraph.

You don’t smoke, do drugs, drink heavily, have tattoos, piercings, or kids. I like my drama like my Netflix, available on demand, not in real life. You’re thoughtful, communicative, and remember the small things, like my coffee order or which side of the blanket I hog.

Ideally you live in the same country. Love letters are cute, but customs forms are not, and I’m not DHL Express. I don’t handle international returns.

# S2E09 Arbitrary Law

📅 *Aired December 1, 1990*

🎬 *Directed by Tim Hunter*

✒️ *Written by Harley Peyton, Robert Engels, and Mark Frost*

**Albert returns to examine Maddy. Cooper asks for twenty-four hours to finish his case. James and Donna reaffirm their love. Andy accidentally leads Donna and Cooper back to Mrs. Tremond's house.**

##🪵 Episode introduction by the Log Lady

>So now the sadness comes. The revelation. There is a depression after an answer is given. It was almost fun not knowing. Yes, now we know. At least we know what we sought in the beginning. But there is still the question, why? And this question will go on and on until the final answer comes. Then the knowing is so full there is no room for questions.

##🚨 Warnings from the Future

Be wary, travelers! In Twin Peaks, even the numbers can be...slippery. Some sources label the Pilot as Episode 0, while others count it as Episode 1. To stay on track, follow the episode titles, not just the numbers. Write it in your diary.

If you've just arrived in Twin Peaks, you should know the original U.S. pilot (1 hour 34 minutes) is the true beginning. It opens the door slowly, letting the fog roll in and the mysteries breathe. The so-called ""International Release"" (1 hour 52 minutes) tacks on an ending that concludes the case far too soon, unraveling secrets meant to linger in shadow.

##🪵 Episode introduction by the Log Lady

>Food is interesting; For instance, why do we need to eat? Why are we never satisfied with just the right amount of food to maintain good health and proper energy? We always seem to want more and more. When eating too much the proper balance is disturbed, and ill health follows. Of course, eating too little food throws the balance off in the opposite direction, and there is the ill health coming at us again. Balance is the key. Balance is the key to many things. Do we understand balance? The word ""balance"" has seven letters. Seven is difficult to balance, but not impossible -- we are able to divide. There are, of course, the pros and cons of division.

I rotate through various methods but espresso is my favorite and I want to buy my first machine. Like a lot of hobbies of mine, when I’m ready to commit, I go all in upfront and commit the time to learn and improve. That’s why I’m willing to spend money to account for things I’ll want/be able to do as I get better.

I’d pull 2 shots a day just for myself, and want to make a variety of milk drinks - cortados, flat whites and cappuccinos. Occasionally make stuff for a couple friends if they’re home. The design and aesthetic of Rocket certainly has some weightage here too.

I learn best by tinkering and experimenting, so I like using complex things and comparing the results. That said, is this overkill? If so, why and what else can I consider that maybe saves me money and/or isn’t a machine that I’ll quickly outgrow? 

The R is $2199. There is also a Giotto Type V for $1850. I feel I probably don’t care about the advantages of a rotary enough to spend $350 more.

(Pictures and Voice Memo in Post! Willing to Travel or Relocate for the Right Person!)","**As a quick preface, I would really appreciate it if you read the entire post! I promise it's not** ***that*** **boring!** 


Hello! I’m Caleb! I’ve decided that it’s about time that I put myself out there in the dating pool, so, uh...here I am. On Reddit. Not the best place, I know (hopefully better than dating apps), but I’m hoping to meet some nice folks. (perhaps you, dear reader?) I’m a quiet, introverted homebody looking for a girl to hangout and go on dates with (I believe the colloquial term for this is a “girlfriend”). I want to make it clear upfront that I’m not looking for short term flings or anything of the sort. Ideally, I’m looking for someone to be with long term, and potentially settle down with. I understand that this is a rather weighty topic to get into right in the opening paragraph, but I try to be open, honest, and communicative about things, so I just wanted to clearly state my intentions.


I am located in East Texas, near Longview, but ***I am willing to relocate for the right person. Just be in the US, please.***


If we hit it off, I’d love to move our chats to another platform so we can do voice and video calls.


[Here's what I sound like!](https://voca.ro/103aM3ke8dW0)


[Here's a picture!](https://imgur.com/a/Ubz79Db)


***Looks***:


I’m black, with olive brown skin. 5’7”, with a lean/athletic build, and just a tad shy of 140lbs. My hair is soft, black, and curly.


[Ok, these are real pictures of me this time, I swear. (I am partially shirtless in one of these, so...you’ve been warned.)](https://imgur.com/a/5wWy81c)


***Interests***:


Gaming – I mostly play singleplayer or co-op games. (I am not very competitive, and all those MOBAs and competitive shooters just seem like the epitome of stress. I don’t mind if you play them, though.) As of late, I’ve been playing a lot of Nier Automata, 7th Dragon 2020, and Sonic Robo Blast 2. I have pretty broad tastes in terms of genres, but if I was forced to narrow it down, I’d say I like retro games, platformers, indies, and RPGs/JRPGs. I’d love to know what sort of games you’re into, and any upcoming games you’re looking forward to!


Music – Music is quite important to me, and I’d definitely consider myself a music lover. I have pretty broad tastes, but I do have a preference for indie/alt/rock stuff. I do listen to some pop, however, along with some Japanese stuff and older R&B. I’ll give most things a try, though! (just, please no country music, I will implode) If you want an idea of what I like, check these out:


Clarion - Hello Juliet


Strawberry Milk Cult – Polarbear!


The Technicolors - Neon Roses


STRFKR – Rawnald Gregory Erikson the Second


Jupiter One – Countdown


Benches – Crash


Jackie Hayes – Last Second


Flawed Mangoes - Surreal


Kinoko Teikoku - 国道スロープ (Kokudou Slope)


Sorry there's so many of these! It was hard to narrow it down!


Cooking – I do a lot of cooking! Am I good at it...well, I’ll let you be the judge of that. I’m trying to branch out a bit and try different cuisines, specifically Asian cuisine as I’m rather deficient in that area. If you know any good recipes, let me know!


Art – I am slowly (heavy emphasis on slowly) teaching myself to draw. I’ve been trying to practice a bit more. It’s...certainly a process, but I’ve definitely noticed a lot of improvement. Perhaps I could draw you someday?


Misc – Well, I’m a nerd in general, really. I enjoy tinkering with tech, and I’ve been doing minor repairs on my laptops and modding my game consoles since I was a teenager. I’m also into anime and sci-fi. Also, while I wouldn’t classify this as an interest or a hobby, I do workout 3-4 times a week, mostly at home. I do enjoy endurance running though, and I typically run a 5k on the weekends (weather permitting). I also love astronomy and space!


***Potential dealbreakers?*** (one of these is a lie)


* I’m left leaning/liberal, politically 
* I don’t want kids
* I have been involved in several CIA backed attempts to overthrow legally elected leaders in foreign countries, specifically between the years of 1960 and 1985.
* I’m Christian, but not the most devout


I am looking for someone with similar values.


***What I'm Looking For***


I’m looking for the sort of relationship that allows us to be vulnerable together. I’d like someone soft (not necessarily in a physical sense, but emotionally), intelligent, and caring. I want someone to hang out with, take out for coffee dates, picnic dates, trips to museums, and binge watch shows with. I want someone that I can learn new things about for the rest of my life, someone to hold and keep safe and grow with.


As for age, I would strongly prefer someone my age or older, though I’m ok with anyone in the 20-40 range. Physically, height does not particularly matter to me (but if you’re tall I will swoon over you). I do, however, have a preference for folks on the slim/lean/toned/fit/skinny side of the body spectrum.


\*cough\*  >! *I have no idea where else to put this but tomboys and alt/goth/emo girls are quite cute but this isn't a requirement or anything okay bye*!<  \*cough\*


*I would also prefer someone outside of my own ethnicity.*


***FAQs***


\~You sound like a dork.


That’s not even a question, and how dare you. You’re correct, but how dare you.


\~In 1964, the United States was involved in a coup against Brazilian leader João Goulart, specifically providing fuel and weapons to military rebels, as well as assisting in organizing street protests against Goulart. This lead to Goulart’s overthrow and a subsequent 20-year long military dictatorship. Were you in any way, shape, or form, involved in this operation?


Uh...no comment.


\~You wouldn't happen to be interested in heinous, scandalous, devious activities such as    >!hand holding!<   ,   >! cuddling!<   , and  >!forehead kissing!<   , would you?


Why, of course not! Never!    >!(yes, absolutely)!<


Thank you for reading this far, and sorry for the long post! I wanted to be thorough and descriptive. If you’re interested, please send me a message with a little about yourself and a picture, and let me know what your favorite Pokémon type is!


Thanks again, and have a wonderful rest of your day!

I thought I was warming up by checking email, refreshing Slack, and messing with my to-do list.

Really, I was stalling because I was scared to start something hard.

It wasn't about how much work I had. It was about waiting to “feel ready” and losing half the morning.

The more I put off the work, the heavier it got.

I didn't realize those delays were making me look like someone who hides behind busywork.

One Thursday, after bouncing between Gmail and Asana, I told myself, “I'll start after coffee,” and instantly felt like crap.

That’s when something snapped.

I wondered what it would look like if the most important task wasn’t negotiable.

I wrote about this in [NoFluffWisdom](https://NoFluffWisdom.com/subscribe) because so many office people are drowning in tasks but starved for structure.

So I made a rule:

Sit down and open the most important project.  
Work on it for 20 minutes with zero email, zero Slack, zero quick checks.  
Start the day where it actually matters.

The first few days were weird. My brain kept trying to run away.  
But after a week, things shifted.

My mornings felt cleaner.  
My stress dropped.  
And for once, I wasn’t ending my days with the important thing haunting me like unfinished business.

The office didn’t change - I did.

Most productivity problems aren’t about time. They’re about starting.

I am a 39 year old guy in Canada and I have been a widower for five years. My wife passed away suddenly. It turned my whole life upside down. We have a daughter who is 8 now. She became the reason I kept going when everything felt like it was falling apart.

For a long time I was not even thinking about dating. I was just trying to survive each day. Work, parenting, cleaning, cooking, trying to sleep, trying to grieve. I pulled away from friends without meaning to. Everyone around me has families and routines and I did not want to feel like the person who brings sadness into every conversation.

Now that time has passed, I have started thinking about meeting someone again. Not to replace my wife because that is not possible, but just to have companionship and connection again. Someone to laugh with. Someone to sit with at night. Someone who knows me.

Dating at 39 with a child is incredibly hard. Apps feel pointless. Most people swipe away the moment they see I am a dad. In real life I barely meet anyone because my routine is basically work, errands and taking care of my kid. I am not going to bars or clubs. I am not someone who walks up to strangers in coffee shops.

I am starting to feel a real fear that this might be it. My daughter is growing up fast. She deserves her own life, her own world and her own future. I want that for her. But I also cannot ignore the thought that one day the house will be quiet and it will just be me. I do not want her to ever feel responsible for my loneliness. That is not fair to her.

The truth is I miss having a partner. I miss being loved. I miss sharing everyday life with another adult. I did not choose to end up alone. It just happened. And now I feel like I have forgotten how to even look for someone.

I am scared that I waited too long to try again. I am scared that I will blink and be in my fifties or sixties, still alone, still wondering what happened to my life.

I just needed to say it somewhere.

1p54igr,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualPH/comments/1p54igr/ghosted_after_making_out/,Ghosted after Making Out,"On a random Saturday morning around 7am, I just woke up and matched with this guy (he is 4 years older than me). We exchange good mornings as far as I remember and then he immediately to go out with him. Now this was the big mistake I did, I agreed since I will be running errands for the day so I thought why not meet this guy for a bit (I keep blaming this to retrograde and my period brain were not helping me with my decisions atm).

It was a 20min walk from my place to our meeting place while for him, he has a car so that's easy for him. I was running a bit late as it started drizzling and I bumped a friend for a bit. That made him message me through Bee app ""where are you"" few more times. I told him I bumped a friend and stopped for a bit cos it was drizzling nga. He then asked where was I so he could just fetch me halfway. We exchanged pictures of our povs to find each other and after a bit of walking, I passed by a silver car and its window rolled down. It was him. I asked if I should enter and sat on the passenger seat and casually greeted each other. We drive our way to this mall in BGC.

On the way there we had small talks and one of them was out purpose in being in the Bee app. So I honestly said, I am just bored trying to make wholesome connections. While he said he is in for fun coffee hangouts and running buddy, just casual stuff. As we were talking he subtly teasing me by touching the side of my waist as if kinikiliti niya ako when we were joking a bit. After a while, I just found our hands intertwined and thought ""Oh he is this kind of friendly"".

And so, we went to park in the basement parking of this mall, barely no cars and people yet since it was almost 9am-ish. Another dumb moment of mine, I forgot mall hours starts at 10am but haven't realized it by the time. He parked in the most corner of the parking where in fact there are more slots available on the nearest out. As we parked, I thought ""Oh I think this is the part where we exit the car and enter the mall"" (no girl it was still around 9am, mall still closed!!!). 

BUT THEN, as I thought he was just about to take off his seatbelts, he suddenly grabbed my face and give me kisses, not a smack but straightly making out. I WAS SO SHOCKED like I did not expect it at all which was very stupid and naive of me, I stated responding to him. He began to touch me everywhere as well. When I felt like we were about to go far, I cut the sesh and tried to fix myself. We then decided to enter the mall. As soon as we enter the elevator we kinda made out again until the door dings. When it opened, that's when we realized the mall is still closed so we went back and decided to walk around the block. We had few laps while talking about our dating life until he said he is already sweating and that was barely 20mins pa lang. We went back again to his car to cool ourselves. He took off his shirt while I just chill there using my phone not really bothered he was topless but when I put my phone down, I unexpectedly found myself kissing him again. He is touching me everywhere until I stopped him and told him I am on my period, he said ""wrong timing, baby"". We kept on making out until he keeps on putting hand on his bulge but I kept pulling away. Another stupid thing, a little later on, I found my hand on his D and doing it. Long story short I gave him both of the jobs and made him release.

After that, he helped me wipe and clean/sanitize my hands. He changed his clothes and said he'll pay for the parking. He came back and said maybe we should just go to SB and have morning coffee/drinks which was literally within the block of the building we walked earlier. When he stopped the car in front of SB, he said something that goes like ""Can you reserve us some seats, I'll just look for parking. Chat me your order."" I was preoccupied still cleaning myself and agreed with it. I went out and entered SB, there were a lot of people. I chatted him through the app ""It's packed in here"" and a few mins later, he ended our chat, assuming he unmatched. I literally laughed the moment I realized that. I was unbothered and kept my day going with my errands.

Plot twist that I think not a surprise anymore, his name on the app is fake and so his job and company. But later that day, I still managed to found his real identity cos partly of his kwento was real, it's just that parang late lang niya kinwento kasi yung old company niya yung sinabi niya which was Unilab. Well, maybe I was really naive and made a stupid decision that day but that's not on me, I walk forward with clarity that I did not lose something, I learned something.

Not sure if this guy is lurking here on reddit tho but he is a fucker and he did me wrong. I know bad bad karma will get back to him. But now, I figured his real full name, a bit of background, and his current job. I do not need to seek revenge.

1p54i1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/NewParents/comments/1p54i1f/reflux_new_parent/,"Reflux, new parent","Background: I am a new (36) mom, this is my first baby, and shes at 4 weeks now. She breast feeds/I pump and has formula about 1-3 times a day depending. Initially, she bottle fed way to fast, we switched to slower bottles. I breast fed more during this time since it seemed to be easier to feed her. I began to produce more breast milk, now it seems it's harder for her to feed depending on my let down. Im trying to pump regularly if i have the time, so its not so hard on her but its making my supply worse. So bottle feeding is almost becoming easier now because I can control the flow. 

Regarding the reflux: For the past few weeks we have been dealing with reflux. In the hospital they said she was gagging on mucus (normal for newborns). I bring her home, she's never stopped gagging. I was breast feeding her more in the beginning, since it made her spit up less, but since i produce more, its just as bad as it was bottle feeding in the beginning. Initially, i had a lot of trouble getting her to burp, but within the past week or more Ive really gotten good at it, and seeing what works best for her. So i try to burp her every ounce she drinks, and within the breast feeds/switch breasts. No matter how much she burps, what she drinks, she will spit up. I will hold her up from 15 minutes to sometimes an hour after feeding, lay her flat, and she will spit up after a few hours. I almost need her on an elevation to avoid a spit up. And i realize the spit up is normal, but she sometimes chokes on it. I went to the pediatrician and she prescribed medicine, told me i was eating too much acidic food (which i was eating red sauce and Oranges/oj). I don't drink or eat much dairy, not a fan, and reduced my caffeine intake to one small cup of coffee every other day. 
I pump to reduce my let down, but nothing seems to work. She still spits up at any time after she eats and it scares me. It wakes her up from a sleep, it keeps me awake, keeping her up. I feel like i can never put her down, and it's been really draining. If she eats, cries because she poops or pees, i change her, shes on her back for a moment, she starts hiccuping. Then shes awake for a while again.
I could use some other advice with anyone who has dealt with a refluxie babe. My next step is to only pump and do breast milk and formula from the bottle exclusively to see if it's breastfeeding thats the cause.",1,1763949212.0,NewParents,3,1.0,False

1p54g6n,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1p54g6n/roommate_problems/,ROOMMATE PROBLEMS,"I am a bachelor's student in my third semester. I have severe social anxiety.Something as simple as ordering coffee feels like a military operation. Adjusting to a new college, city, and hostel was so overwhelming that my grades suffered in my first year. Just being in this college has been a test for my anxiety every single day.

After a full year, I finally felt like I was adjusting. I thought things would start to go smoothly.

Then I got two new roommates, a year younger than me. We share one room with no clear divisions or boundaries, which is already difficult for me to navigate. 

1.Roommate A is quiet. She does her work silently and calls her parents once a day at a set time. No problem.

2.Roommate B is the issue. She is continuously on the phone with her boyfriend, parents, and friends for 4, 5, 6+ hours non-stop. The hours are unpredictable, so I can never plan my day around it.

For context, I shared this *exact same room* last semester with a senior (who graduated) and a batchmate (who dropped out). With them, I didn't even own earbuds. I could study and get my assignments done in the room. They had set times for things, and it was manageable.

Now, it has not been possible.

Before anyone suggests it: Yes, I have talked to her.

She moved in during the gap between my second-semester exams. She was unbearable back then, too. I talked to her then, but she didn't listen. It got so bad I had to ask my father to arrange a temporary place for me to study for my finals.

I thought maybe it was just the excitement of being in a new environment and it would die down once classes got busy. Instead, she now narrates her entire assignment process in her calls. The talking is never-ending.

Here is what I have already tried:

1. Direct Communication**:** I have spoken to her multiple times, with my legs shaking from anxiety, asking if she could lower her voice or reduce the duration of her calls. The response was a dismissive ""okay"" and no change. She later mocked me by asking, ""Is *this* volume okay?"" while her friend giggled.
2. The ""Bunker"" Protocol: I've created a fortress of silence. I use earplugs, over-ear headphones, and play brown noise at max volume to try and drown her out. I can still hear her.
3. Documentation: I have started taking timestamped notes and photos of the space to log the disruptions, thinking I might need evidence for a warden.
4. DIY Engineering: I've tried to make my own reusable earplugs with cotton cloth because I can't afford to keep buying disposable ones.
5. Schedule Inversion: My new plan is to wake up at 3 AM to claim a few hours of silent study time, since peace is impossible during the day.
6. Unfortunately there is no library or study rooms near me. Otherwise I would only come here to eat and sleep. The college library also closes after office hours. So there is no third spaces to go to too.

I am exhausted. I feel like I'm fighting a war just to be able to think. I'm not looking for magic solutions, but has anyone else survived a roommate like this? How do you cope when you've tried everything and the person just does not care? As I am writing this post B is talking in her loud voice. ",1,1763949053.0,socialanxiety,0,0.99,False

We exchange good mornings as far as I remember and then he immediately to go out with him. Now this was the big mistake I did, I agreed since I will be running errands for the day so I thought why not meet this guy for a bit (I keep blaming this to retrograde and my period brain were not helping me with my decisions atm). It was a 20min walk from my place to our meeting place while for him, he has a car so that's easy for him. I was running a bit late as it started drizzling and I bumped a friend for a bit. That made him message me through Bee app ""where are you"" few more times. I told him I bumped a friend and stopped for a bit cos it was drizzling nga. He then asked where was I so he could just fetch me halfway. We exchanged pictures of our povs to find each other and after a bit of walking, I passed by a silver car and its window rolled down. It was him. I asked if I should enter and sat on the passenger seat and casually greeted each other. We drive our way to this mall in BGC. On the way there we had small talks and one of them was out purpose in being in the Bee app. So I honestly said, I am just bored trying to make wholesome connections. While he said he is in for fun coffee hangouts and running buddy, just casual stuff. As we were talking he subtly teasing me by touching the side of my waist as if kinikiliti niya ako when we were joking a bit. After a while, I just found our hands intertwined and thought ""Oh he is this kind of friendly"". And so, we went to park in the basement parking of this mall, barely no cars and people yet since it was almost 9am-ish. Another dumb moment of mine, I forgot mall hours starts at 10am but haven't realized it by the time. He parked in the most corner of the parking where in fact there are more slots available on the nearest out. As we parked, I thought ""Oh I think this is the part where we exit the car and enter the mall"" (no girl it was still around 9am, mall still closed!!!). BUT THEN, as I thought he was just about to take off his seatbelts, he suddenly grabbed my face and give me kisses, not a smack but straightly making out. I WAS SO SHOCKED like I did not expect it at all which was very stupid and naive of me, I stated responding to him. He began to touch me everywhere as well. When I felt like we were about to go far, I cut the sesh and tried to fix myself. We then decided to enter the mall. As soon as we enter the elevator we kinda made out again until the door dings. When it opened, that's when we realized the mall is still closed so we went back and decided to walk around the block. We had few laps while talking about our dating life until he said he is already sweating and that was barely 20mins pa lang. We went back again to his car to cool ourselves.

My new job is great- nice local cafe, lovely customers, lovely owner.

I can dial in, do decent latte art (still improving!), deal with common machine problems, etc. I really enjoy the process of making coffee. But holy shit, I still hate the taste. I can taste the difference between a good shot and a bad shot, but the subtleties are lost on me. I've never gotten a bad review and customers have always come up to say how nice the coffee is- but shit, I'm just taking their word for it. 

I've honestly never been into coffee- I've always been immune to the mythical caffeine buzz, so I don't get anything out of it in that sense. But I always see people talk about how you'll learn to like coffee after working so long with it. A year and a half of part-time work isn't technically a lot but I've only ever worked solo/duo shifts, so I've never had a day of not being on the machine. I've tasted so much coffee and I still can't stand it.

This job isn't a huge focus of mine- I'm full-time in college and ultimately I am just here to help pay the bills. But I would like to learn how to appreciate coffee a bit more, if there's anything I can do.",3,1763949005.0,barista,2,0.81,False

Over the last few years, I have been writing a children’s book series about Benny, a little duck in a big world, who wants to inspire others to be kind, compassionate, and curious about the world around them. The series follows Benny’s travels around the world and is a love letter to my favourite places. I actually met the illustrator through this sub / so thank you for that - she was a dream to work with and and an excellent collaborator - I’d be happy to recommend her to you if you want to DM me. 

This year I felt inspired to write about Benny’s adventures in Nova Scotia to make others fall in love with it too. This whole process had me thinking about all the little details and little things I love about home - the things that make it so uniquely warm and comforting. I'm looking at Halifax in ways I never had before. I also was able to add my parents and brother into the book! This book feels like a cozy cup of coffee and a big hug.

I’m all about finding that natural, comfortable vibe where we can be ourselves and enjoy the little things in life.

A bit about me:

I’m a big fan of PC gaming (especially when I can team up with friends – I’m a good sport, I swear).

Coffee is my true love – if you’re into espresso, I think we’ll get along just fine. ☕

Lately, I’ve been trying to get more into outdoor stuff like camping, hiking, and fishing. I think it’s about time I take advantage of nature’s beauty.

When I’m not outside or gaming, you’ll probably find me painting Warhammer 40k miniatures (it’s my brain off time) or getting into some pixel art.

Now, let’s talk about my hobbies and passions :

I’m a huge Dungeons & Dragons fan – whether I’m playing or just creating characters, I’m all about the storytelling and roleplay. If you’ve got a campaign going, I’m always down to join!

Lord of the Rings is a world I can never get enough of. Give me a good Middle-earth adventure, and I’m hooked.

And if you love dinosaurs, we’re practically kindred spirits. I can talk about prehistoric creatures for hours (just try me!).

Physically, I’m 6’1”, have short brown hair, a beard, and glasses. I’m on the skinnier side, but I try to carry myself with confidence and humor. I guess I’m one of those “I’m not perfect, but I’m real” kind of people.

What I’m looking for:

I’m hoping to find someone who appreciates the same mix of things – whether that’s a love for good coffee, getting lost in fantasy worlds, or just taking some time to appreciate the outdoors. A sense of humor is key, and I’m all about honesty and genuine connection. Whether you want to chat about Middle-earth, brainstorm D&D campaigns, or bond over a love of dinosaurs, I’m all for it.

I’m a pretty laid-back person, but I’m also someone who really cares about the people in my life. I value deep conversations, those spontaneous, silly moments, and just feeling at ease with someone. I’m not into drama or games – I’m here for something real and easy-going.

If you're into coffee, D&D, dinosaurs, or just looking for someone who’s kind, honest, and enjoys the simple things in life, feel free to reach out! I’d love to connect and see where it goes. <3

I am wondering whether that applies to my situation, since pooping twice means 7 or 8 hours per day in pain instead of only 4 or 5.

Bad hemorroid pain started a few days after I pushed really hard during bowel movement before going to an event (where there would be no toilets) about 4 weeks ago.  PCP gave me Rx cortisone suppositories for 6 days but pain persisted. PCP says I have internal hemorroids and scheduled me for anoscopy; but for now I am in a holding pattern.  I have always eaten a high fiber diet, but last several weeks also drink lots of water, stool softener, sitz bath, never push, etc.

Bowel movements hurt for the first week or so, but now they are only mildly annoying.  

I always have a bowel movement about 60-90 minutes after I get up and have breakfast.  About 20 minutes later, the pain comes and stays with me for about four or five hours, though it can be usually mitigated lying on side and always mitigated by bending over with my butt in the air--the pain is great enough that I can't do much aside from lie down and read or talk on the phone.  If I have a second bowel movement, it hurts for another three hours too much to do anything.

This second bowel movement seems to be somewhat optional.  I may get an urge or two early afternoon but if I don't go then, it passes until the next day--unless I drink coffee.

So it seems to me that having only one bowel movement per day would be better since I have about three more hours per day where I can actually do something.  But that contradicts standard advice.  Is there something I am overlooking?",1,1763948474.0,hemorrhoid,1,1.0,False

1p545ug,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1p545ug/need_advice/,Need Advice,"For context: I’m a 20 year old woman who has a strained relationship with my father. When I was younger one time he even drove me to an adoption center and threatened to leave me there, he told me all the things that happened to women in there. It scarred me for life. The times he’d thrown tools at me, pinch me, he even slapped me hard in my head gear when I did taekwondo it made me bleed. Basically I always seemed a disappointment to him, I never wanted to do the things he wanted me to like softball or volleyball or try new things. Anyways, I live with him, my mother (he didn’t marry her) my older brother (23), my little brother (11)  and my little sister (8). Basically, when I was little (before my two younger siblings were born), my mom was in college. She has this horrible team leader but basically he apologized to her and invited her just for a friendly coffee. My dad snooped through my mom’s emails and assumed she cheated on him. She took me and my brother to our grandparents, untill my dad came to apologize and showed up in a nice suit. He told her to just tell him the truth and she did, that she didn’t cheat. (My mom is slightly religious, used to go to church when little and reads the Bible and watches videos) He told her he believed her, and yet a couple weeks later her would say comments about her cheating and being a gold digger. Fast forward, years later they ended up having my younger siblings. Over the past year, my dad has stopped talking to my mom since he recently claimed he would “make her feel the pain he felt for 14 years”. He has started booking random week long vacation every few months. He even bought himself a new phone that he tried to hide. My mother broke down when she saw him have opened dating websites of different women like Latina, Asian, etc. He started buying women’s things, jewelry, a teddy bear, and most recently a pair of size 8.5 women’s boots and shoes. He told my older brother when he asked that he was “just looking for houses”. My older brother is slightly naive. My dad always had things locked up, kept private. He has this tool box with a lock, I opened it one day, sat down for over an hour doing random numbers until I got it. I found how he wrote down the name of that man’s parent’s house. I also found on his phone (I wasn’t able to unlock) but saw the weather for Vietnam. It started to click, that maybe he met a woman in Vietnam and is buying her clothing and such and meeting her. I don’t know what to do. I tried talking to my dad one day cause my mother asked, she hasn’t had the courage to talk to him yet she makes dinner, does laundry, takes care of my siblings. I was so scared he would hit me, he got so angry. I don’t know how to help my mom, myself or my siblings. I don’t even have my drivers license yet cause I’ve asked my mother and older brother and they won’t help me, they are too busy or just don’t have time. I feel trapped, I never had a relationship like most kids did with their dad, I hide in my room when I come home from work and don’t emerge till he’s gone. I don’t talk to him, I keep outta his way. I feel bad for my mom, but I don’t wanna listen to her I don’t want to hear it, I just can’t care how my siblings and everyone around me lives with it. Especially my mother. My little siblings act like it’s normal, their minds busy in electronics all day. They must get that from me, cause I try to act normal for them. I just don’t know what to do, I even cried one time when all he did was look at me.

1p545br,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cooking/comments/1p545br/law_school_spices_need_to_be_tossed_now_what/,"Law school spices need to be tossed, now what?","Hi all. I have been building my spice drawer for four years, starting with my senior year living situation and then adding onto the collection based on cookbook/recipe of the mind necessities for the three years of law school. 

When I graduated and moved back into my parents house to study for the bar back in may, all my spices went into a big plastic bin in my dad‘s warehouse. Fast-forward six months and the bin smells awful, in part due to my brother packing unsealed coffee and powdered tea in with the spices. We also found a roach crawling around in the bin and what is either mouse or roach dung. My fiancé and I are afraid we might need to toss everything but the glass my spices came in- basically just saving the containers by putting them through the dishwasher after throwing away thirty~forty different herbs and spices. 

So if I have to start from scratch, and buy an entire new set for a family of two, I want to know what the best brands are. I want to know what you would restock your kitchen with if everything you had was lost to fire or flood. What brands taste the best? What is budget friendly for buying literally everything you think a couple with a broad palette needs? Any suggestions for what spices or herbs i must go out of my way to acquire from xyz, no matter the cost? We cook A LOT, and want to keep international flavors in the house, so if there’s something you consider a staple for your cultural recipes i am eager to put it in my shopping cart.

I don't know how to fix myself.,"This is a repost of one of my older ones, but I need some advice about it this time. I constantly feel burnt out and I don't know if my situation has anything to do with it. Sorry if this is the wrong place for this. I added some stuff but kept things from the old post too so this might seem all over the place. Sorry in advance. 

I don't know what to call this post because everything is just a mess. I want to go to sleep forever I'd rather that than live right now. So many people tell me it will get better one day but it's not and I can't wait anymore. That's about it.

I'll put the story under this but I know a lot of people don't want to read a whole book so yeah, what I said above is basically the vent.

I (18F) live with my younger sister and my mom. My dad doesn't come around anymore and he's an alcoholic and he did something alcohol related that led him to go to jail and I saw what he did, can't forget unfortunately and it makes me feel guilty even though there's nothing I could've done as a 9 (I think 9) year old. He was also not a good or nice person in general. I don't know him well now though.

My sister is autistic (and has some other things as well but I don't want to get into it because it will make this longer) and can get very violent. She also is mentally way younger than her age. She's basically been stressing everyone out and making everyone at the end of their patience because so many things in the house is destroyed and she hurts people. The doctors are working on it but still there's no solution. I get blamed a lot when I ""set her off"" or make her ""blow up"" because I decided to either talk in the wrong tone or do something normal like get something to eat (but at the wrong time apparently). Most people in my family think I bother her on purpose, and that I just want attention when I get upset about our living situation. Apparently since I am ""not the mentally ill one"", I shouldn't feel the way I do (which is burnt out). My mom says I offer no support to my sister, but if I am being honest, I am trying. Whenever I try to help, I do it wrong and it starts chaos, so I just stopped trying. I am so tired this is so tiring I get screamed at every day about it as if everything that happens is my fault. I hate it I hate myself. I wish I was a better person. I suck. My mom constantly says ""other kids who have disabled/mentally ill siblings..."" basically comparing me and calling me shit compared to the ones that actually can help. She also said if I saw someone in a wheelchair I would help them more than my sister. I am confused at the comparisons. She says I'm selfish and only care about myself. She also said I am just like my dad which makes me want to die.

I also go to university now. Many of my family members have very high expectations of me in this regard because I am doing something my sister may not get to do (because of her intellectual disability), and it was mentioned before that I have to make my mom proud as my sister may not get to ever do grad and stuff. Originally, I wanted to go into psychology, but I can't do that because I am not interested anymore and I don't want to fail and get kicked out of the school. I want to go into law now. I haven't told anyone really yet but I have a feeling they'll be mad that I changed my mind. I am so stressed about this as well as my home life. I told my mom I wanted to be a lawyer and she laughed at me and said I couldn't because I get nervous when talking to people I don't know. I'm trying my best to be more social I swear. I hate this too.

I decided to write this because I just got yelled at yet again, and my mom dumped my laundry on my floor in my room, and I have no energy now and I was going to go to school but I have no energy to so I am staying home crying in my bed. I feel like such a loser. I also had plans to meet up with my two new friends today and watch a movie since our class is canceled today but they canceled them last minute so I am extra sad, but it's not their fault :(

I wish I had someone to talk to about it and I really need a hug but I don't want to tell anyone I am on good terms with in case this changes their mind about me. I wish I wasn't a piece of shit. I want a new life where I can start over and maybe have both parents be parents and not people who weren't ready. 

I also am the ""boring"" friend. My friend is always late to my plans but whenever our other friend has plans she's just on time. I'm also a broke student, so I can't buy any clothes or literally anything. It sucks but I am trying to get a job but it's hard. I am being honest too, I sometimes get picked on for being lazy cause I don't have a job but trust me I would like money it's not that I am being lazy. When my friends ask to go to starbucks or to go get lunch I can't because I can't pay $8 for a coffee everyday and I look boring to them because of that. My friends parents give her money every month and I am so happy for her but it's not the case for me. 

Also, whenever I want to talk to my mom she's either busy or goes on a rant about me not being nice enough to my sister. But whenever I don't tell her stuff she gets mad. I can never tell her anything about how I feel and keeping my feelings bottled up is making my brain explode. She is stressed too I get it but I feel like she hates me.

I'm so upset right now you don't even know.

I wish I had a friend or something who knew me for real and cared. I am so by myself all the time and it's so upsetting. I can't even cope anymore. I usually just daydream all the time nonstop like it is addiction so I can ""escape"" in a way. I'm tired. 

I could keep writing but I won't. Goodbye and Thank you if you read it.

My wife is 26, she is a housewife. She is extremely sweet, she has a ton of empathy and is very sensitive. I don’t really use any social media, I have Facebook and haven’t been on in months and that is it. My wife however was constantly on instagram and watching Tik tok, she would watch news stories and dumb content that made her worked up/upset

It got to a point where she would be red and almost shaky, just as an example she would see a news story about something awful like a murder, and read comments from idiots making fun and get so upset.

So, I take her phone at night when I get home from work. She has an I pad, which she does not download any socials on. Just games/books and she uses that, she can also respond to texts on it since her phone is connected. It keeps her from scrolling, if I’m sitting next to her she can have it unless I see any issues.

And as for the news, I don’t exactly lock down the TV. I don’t think she has much interest in it and won’t pick it over Netflix so it’s not a huge issue, I just watch it alone when I’m drinking my coffee and as soon as she is up I turn it off.

I obviously can’t keep everything from her but this has made so much progress, I was telling my friends this because so far this has been great for her mental health. Like I said she doesn’t work, so the only problem with not having a traditional job is she can be on her phone more but she has been scrolling less even during the day. She told me she has started putting movies on while cooking and cleaning and doesn’t touch her phone. She spends the rest of her time shopping/at the spa or salon and she’s been listening to a dance moms podcast or something.

So genuinely it is working, and keeping her from the news was always something I felt it wasn’t job to do, she shouldn’t be worried about current issues or politics so throwing that in there was a really good thing for her.  

She is way less stressed now, and realistically as long as I know what’s going on she doesn’t need to. If she absolutely needs to know something I can tell her",0,1763947928.0,AITAH,46,0.25,False
1p5429h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p5429h,One River Tea Hidden Cave Dancong 2025,"6.5g/80mL, just off boil

Dry leaves from afar smell like cookies, but pick up some fruitiness up close

Wet leaves smell like coffee and raspberry preserves 

Wash (consumed - 10s) - aroma of a bakery, dark raisin/date/jujube fruitiness, light steep since half my leaves were outside of the pot, initial roast flavor - coffee beans and cacao nibs, floral notes starting to open a little in mouth, peanutty Zongzi note as late sweetness starts to overlap the initial roast that is clinging 

Steep 1 (flash) - roast steps back a bit bringing out notes of apricots, touch of astringency with the roast giving faint coffee bean or peanut akin impression, roast has already faded from the aroma leaving a sweet stonefruit and raspberry aroma in the cup

Steep 2 (flash) - roast isn't fading away so much as integrating into the flavor, this is pushing the fruitiness into the dark raspberry/blackberry realm, darker as in more like preserves or syrup rather than fresh fruit, this is paired with a sweet peanut character, sweeter in the nose than on the palate

Steep 3 (5s) - big raspberry aroma as the hot water hits the leaves, mix of dark berries and peanuts in the glass, not quite peanutty in a way that makes me think of a PB&J, but certainly a comforting familiarity in this flavor combination, sweetness is a nice undertone that ties it all together much like Lebowski's rug

Steep 4 (10s) - peanut brittle from the previous sips lays a foundation for the berries of the next sip to wash over, now I am getting PB&J vibes as a mineral salinity shows up for an instant

Steep 5 (15s) - I'm finally stopping to notice the mouthfeel is pleasingly creamy, floral notes are a bit more noticeable in the open mouth reminding me that this is indeed a Dancong and not a Yancha, the roast is a notable part of the flavor profile, but far from being dominant, sweetness starting to cling to the gums nicely

Steep 6 (20s) - floral notes in the aromatics continue to gain traction, sweet peanut is still the base, but fruit and floral notes become more and more prevalent 

Steep 7+ (30s+) - floral notes continue to show up more as the steeps progress, nice long sweet finish


Overall Impression - This is another really nice Dancong by Wen Zitong. The roast is a bit more prominent here, but after the first steep or two (where I always tend to get the most aggressive roast character) it settles right in as a nice peanutty note. There is a pleasant sweetness that supports the roasty notes and the raspberry preserves. This is really nice already, but I can imagine that as the roast mellows a bit more this will get even better. The raspberry note is really nice, and there are some floral notes that start to show through in the later steeps as the roast starts to ease back a bit.",13,1763947922.0,tea,2,0.94,False

I’m a secret rebel currently masquerading as a VP in tech aka corpo drone, constantly trying to get back at Bob Loblaws while figuring out how to get around this city with construction galore. Proud owner of a number of cozy sweaters (aka free human furnace), minor Coke Zero addict and a bit of lingering abandonment issues (working on it), major pizza fanatic - hoping to find a smart, funny, child free (obv), physically active partner who wants to live our DINKY life, have company for her dog walks and I dunno… nonchalantly fall for each other I guess. As an added bonus, we can finally become real adults and be each others emergency contacts.

Currently busy growing a mini jungle at home, adding to my Spotify playlist each week, excited like a kid again with hockey season (damn you leafs 😭), playing random rec sports (floor hockey, beach volleyball etc) each week to stay active and sneaking in standup comedy/concerts (join me!) as much as possible. Always down for some fun travel adventures (India, Greece, Jamaica plus a bunch of US spots for work so far this year), enjoying coffee throughout the city, BBQing my heart out, petting any dogs that make eye contact and helping the local economy by hitting patios when the mood strikes.

Physically I’m 5’11, 205, shaved head and a thick black beard (now featuring white strands!) and live in downtown Toronto. Ideally looking for someone local within the downtown area as one of my love languages is quality time and through past relationships, I’ve learned how much i appreciate spending time with my partner.

1p53vt4,https://www.reddit.com/r/FibroidHerbalRemedies/comments/1p53vt4/my_intro_and_hopefully_my_accountability/,My Intro (And hopefully my accountability),"Hello All, 

I just wanted to make this post because I'm so overwhelmed by this fibroid. I tried the myomectomy route (That post is on the regular fibroids subreddit), and I've had this fibroid now for almost two years (That I know of). I've decided to stop being wishy washy about my healing and be absolutely consistent with everything I am doing to try and shrink this thing. its between 7-8 cm and bulges out. It sits on nerves when I have an inflammation flare up. At one point I thought I was having a heart attack and went to the ER but nope it was the demon (yes, I do call it a demon). So my protocol for the past twenty days has been:

Anti inflammatory diet- basically more fruits, veggies, sardines and eggs. less raw and cold things, NO added sugar or artificial sweeteners, reduced dairy (as best as I can. I try to stick to low lactose and cheeses that have casein A2, not A1, so basically sticking to goat and sheep cheeses and NO cow dairy) reduced gluten (as best as I can, this is a hard one. If its in my meal, I try to make sure I have veggies first so as not to spike blood sugar). NOTHING FRIED, and I'm avoiding red meat in general.

 I make a smoothie with beets, berries, oranges, spinach, apple, ginger, and turmeric, and flax seeds, but not every day. 

I drink a women's wellness tea which includes the herbs we all know by now (vitex, red raspberry leaf, shatavari, etc etc, its from Magic Hour called Queen of Wellness.. I don't expect it to solve anything honestly as the dose is not therapeutic at all but I want to get SOME in my body. I also make a ""tonic"" with either jujube and goji, or hibiscus and dried dark mulberries and add cinnamon, ginger, cloves and star anise. I make a pot of this and store it in the fridge. sometimes I drink it as a tea (I heat it again) or I use it as the liquid in my smoothie.

Adaptogens. NO Ashwagandha because that made the fine hairs on my face grow and darken in some places, and no Maca either for the same reason. I use reishi mushroom with cacao and I add tahini, cinnamon, cardamom for the added benefits. (And a splash of orange blossom water because why not)

Sometimes I'll have a black sesame latte. 

I drink at least one cup of green tea/matcha a day. sometimes twice if I'm not FULL of all the other drinks plus water lol. If you're making latte's with nut milks avoid the stuff with the fillers and gums because that will cause inflammation. to be honest I just use water most of the time and skip out on the creamy latte texture. 

Bone broth with various veggies, sometimes I top the soup with black seed (nigella) and sardines. Or eggs.

Anyway there are a lot of recipes I've developed for myself but the point is being anti-inflammatory. 

I do a foot soak almost every single day with magnesium flakes and Chinese herbs. Sometimes before bed, sometimes in the morning. Always with one of my drinks in hand. It also helps relax the nervous system too, as anxiety plays a role in too much cortisol.

I do a castor oil pack on the fibroid and my liver every night. sometimes in the morning too depending on how I feel and if I have time. Just castor oil, an organic cotton flannel, and a heating pad (heating pad for an hour, but i leave the flannel on overnight. I'm thinking of getting a Japanese haramaki to keep it in place.

Walking ten thousand steps a day. I used to pace around my coffee table (Its hard for me to go outside, I live in a dangerous neighborhood) but I've got a walking pad now. To be honest this is the one most hard to keep up with because I'm just always in pain and want to lay down. But in my opinion its one of the more important things to keep up with. I try to get most of my steps in the morning when there's no one else around to interrupt or need me. Its also nice not to have to try and make the step count before going to bed. I'm usually satisfied if I've reached 5000-7000. I try to be easy on my self. When I'm on my period I'm happy if I get 2000, unless its really bad then I'll just stay in bed if I can.

facial and scalp gua sha- this is just a nervous system relaxation thing for me. Y'all, I am really wound up lol and I'm pretty sure it plays a role in keeping this fibroid... happy... so. relaxation techniques for me are important.

Other herbs and supplements:

I'm taking seamoss with bladderwrack and burdock root, Dr. Berg's vitamin D, Black seed oil with turmeric (but also adding turmeric to smoothies and soups, as well as adding black seed to soups, or on top of eggs, or eating half a teaspoon of the seeds with a spoon of honey) A supplement my acupuncturist gave me that has a loooong list of herbs.

I'm also doing a parasite cleanse. This one is precarious because I have to time when I take it, so it doesn't interfere with any other herbs or foods...

  
Things I want to implement later when I get this routine down (It's been twenty days, you'd think I got it but... life gets in the way): Acupuncture (again. I've tried this before but only on its own) Hijama wet cupping therapy (again. I did this before as well but only on its own while eating a horrendous diet..) and Lymphatic drainage massage. If I cant work up the courage to go get a massage. Anyway... That's all of it. I'm trying to stay away from stressful situations and people as well. I guess at this point, at this size, I have no other option than making this my lifestyle. Wish me luck!",3,1763947400.0,FibroidHerbalRemedies,0,1.0,False

1p53v3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/MovedToSpain/comments/1p53v3s/making_friends_in_spain_is_genuinely_hard/,Making Friends in Spain is Genuinely Hard,"I'm gonna be real with you. making friends in Spain sucks at first. Like it genuinely sucks. Everyone talks about how friendly Spanish people are and they're right, they are, but that friendliness doesn't automatically translate into actually having friends. The locals already have their crew from school or their neighbourhood and they're not really looking to add randoms to that.

I spent my first three months here thinking I was doing something wrong. I'd go out, meet people, we'd have a good conversation over drinks, and then... nothing. They never texted. I'd see them on the street and they'd be friendly but it wasn't going anywhere. It wasn't until I stopped trying so hard that I realized it's just how it works here. Spanish people aren't unfriendly, they're just locked into their existing groups and they need a reason to let someone in.

The breakthrough for me was realizing you can't force it. You have to get comfortable being a bit lonely while you're building actual friendships, and that's just the reality nobody tells you about moving abroad. Everyone's like ""oh Spain is amazing, you'll make friends so easily"" and then you're sitting at home on a Saturday night wondering why nobody's responding to your messages.

So here's what actually worked. First, I stopped trying to make friends through bars and random events. I joined a gym that had a community vibe and started going regularly. Like seriously regularly. Same time, same place. Started recognizing the same people. Started small talking with them. After a few weeks of this, people started inviting me to grab coffee after. Nothing crazy, just ""hey you want to grab a coffee?"" but it was consistent contact with the same humans. That matters way more than meeting a bunch of different people once.

The second thing was I got involved in something that was actually important to me. I started volunteering at this local tech meetup and suddenly I had a reason to be somewhere regularly with a shared purpose. The people there weren't my friends at first, they were just people I saw every two weeks, but over time something shifted. You realize you've actually talked to the same person multiple times, you know things about their life, they know things about yours. That's how friendships actually happen.

I also made peace with the fact that some friendships here move slower. Like weirdly slower. Someone I'd been talking to for two months finally invited me to do something with their friend group and I almost cried because it felt like such a big deal. In other countries that would happen after like two beers. Here it took actual time. But once they invited me into their group, it felt real. Like I wasn't a tourist anymore.

The expat angle is tricky because you could just hang out exclusively with other expats and never actually integrate, but that's kind of defeating the point of moving somewhere. That said, other expats are useful when you're first settling in because at least you're not completely alone. But I found that actual Spanish friendships are way more rewarding, even if they take longer to build.

What really helped was finding people who were actually interested in the same things I was interested in. I'm into tech and startups so finding people in that world, even just online groups or events, gave me a way to connect with people who I'd naturally get along with. Turns out being friends with someone is easier if you actually like the same stuff.

The other thing I did was just accept being uncomfortable for a while. Like I went to things alone. I sat in cafÃ©s by myself reading a book so people would see me regularly. I became a fixture at my gym. I showed up consistently to events even when I didn't know anyone. It felt awkward as hell but after a few months of this, people started recognizing me and it snowballed from there.

Also honestly, the neighbourhood you live in matters. I eventually moved to an area where there were more young people and it was just way easier to be around people, run into them at the market, chat with them at the coffee place. Not that you can always choose where to live, but if you can, pick somewhere that feels alive and has people around.

My advice is don't expect friendships to happen quickly and don't take it personally when they don't. Spanish people aren't cold, they're just selective about who they let into their world. Once you're in though, they're loyal and genuinely cool. It just takes time and consistent presence. Stop showing up sporadically and start being a regular somewhere. Find something you actually care about and get involved. Be patient. It'll happen but it won't happen on the timeline you're used to.

The people I'm closest to here now are people I spent months just casually running into before we actually became friends. That's just how it works in Spain and once you accept that, it's actually kind of nice because the friendships feel more intentional.",1,1763947344.0,MovedToSpain,0,1.0,False

I'm drinking decaf coffee instead of usual x2 coffees a day.

I know 20g is a low starting dose but was happy to not have any adverse effects on the first couple of days however almost feeling worse?

Very tired, irritable, my focus & motivation levels are similar.

I'm wondering if it's the caffeine withdrawals, curious if anyone else has approached it like this?   
  
I've also been prescribed 30mg should I not notice any effect after a couple of weeks.

I realise it's still early days but feeling a bit disheartened.
