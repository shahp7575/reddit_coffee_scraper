1. **Drink Temperature:** Even with the temperature turned all the way up, the coffee and milk drinks were always a bit cooler than I‚Äôd like.
2. **Constant Self-Cleaning:** The machine seemed to clean itself obsessively‚Äîseveral times a day‚Äîeven when barely used. It felt excessive.
3. **Tray Management:** Tied to #2, the drip tray filled up fast. With 4‚Äì6 drinks per day, we had to empty the tray daily, which became a hassle.

I know some self-cleaning is standard for superautos, but is this level typical? Do all machines require the tray to be emptied this often? Or is there a more efficient option out there?

1-I should've explained ir better but my restriction order was a temporal one, only for 30 days.
2-Peter was a very good husband. I read that he was abusive all throughout our relationship, he wasn't. And he was a good dad to Jack. Everything went to hell when I caught him cheating.
3-What Jack was saying wasn't told by Peter, I talked to him and I made sure, he just has been missing our life before.
4-Peter would NEVER touch Jack like some of you suggested. My case may make it seem like he could, but he never even touched me or groomed me. I did talk to Jack, just to make sure, and he reassured me nothing happened.

Now, onto the update. I did meet with Peter, most of you told me not to go to his apartment so I told him to meet at a park, take a walk, or something. When I saw him, he was different. He looked very depressed and he hugged me when he saw me. He wouldn't stop apologizing for what happened.

We started talking and walking, he didn't justify what he said or did, but he did say he regrets it. He said that he misses me and misses being together. I asked about Allison and he told me that he cut her and his parents out, which I believe he did, and then I asked about what he said about Jack. He basically said that he resented Jack for a long time because my attention wasn't on him anymore, and it was selfish, but he was too used to be the center of my world so when it suddenly changed, he couldn't take it. He told me he loves Jack but that he sustains that if giving him up meant to have me back, he would do it in a heartbeat.

We talked for hours while Jack was with my friend, I cried a lot, there were things I decided not to ask like if he was drugging me like some of you said, because I honestly don't want to know. We have been texting these past days, mostly about Jack, but I'm considering family therapy, mostly to help Jack cope with everything. The divorce is still happening which Peter wasn't too happy about but he wasn't angry anymore, just sad.

Any thoughts to share?

Splurge:

Wall Hacking: Can totally change the layout and flow of a space

Custom Cabinetry /Storage only for odd shaped, non-standard layouts (mansionettes or landed with staircase in the middle of the house) or very high ceilings etc: This can really help with storage of belongings to fully maximise the space.

Heavy use furniture: Spend more and scrutinize /test big items that are meant to be heavy use, ie . Living Room Sofa, Study Table, Dining table, Mattresses. Avoid buying unless you can see/ test the real product, don't just rely on online reviews.

Aircon:  Best stick to established Japanese brands. Save you alot of maintenance costs /replacement costs down the road.

Electrical sockets: Need to plan beforehand, as its very tricky and costly to rewire later.

Ceiling Fans: Absolutely a must in our weather unless you intend to turn on air-con all the time. Relying on standing fans works only in smaller areas.

Save:

Going overboard on custom carpentry when there is no need to. Seen so many examples of homes aspiring to be ""Muji"", ""Aesop"", luxury hotels and boutiques but the end results look nothing like the inspiration and looks worse than the sum of its parts.

Feature walls: Not necessary, just use a fresh coat of paint and/or add a cheap painting/artwork can achieve similar effects for a fraction of the cost.

Secondary use furniture: Coffee tables, bed side tables, armchairs or accent chairs, benches. No need to spend too much

Flooring: Vinyl overlay is good enough for most cases, except for kitchen /wet areas.

Bathtub or similar feature in shower: White elephant, hard to maintain over time.",1,1745980884.0,askSingapore,2,1.0,False

Now I‚Äôm talking in generalities and averages so I‚Äôm not here to argue about exceptions. 

What I‚Äôm here to debate about his female standards particularly beautiful women and how there‚Äôs no real reason for them to lower their high standards. 

In this case let‚Äôs say an objectively beautiful woman is some where between girl next door beautiful (7-7.5 out of 10) to drop dead gorgeous (10 out of 10). 

From probably the age of 14 these women have be pursued heavily for long term relationships by high status men. They were pursed by the high status jocks who had a BMW and daddy‚Äôs money when in high school and they‚Äôre pursed by mid 6 figure investment bankers as grown women. So naturally they‚Äôre used to a certain lifestyle. 

Where I think the problem comes in is the average men with little resources and status still believes the objective 7.5-8/10 woman is obtainable to him. Let me give a hypothetical:

*25 year old man (5-6/10) making 50k a year sees woman (7.5/10) he believes she‚Äôs the hottest woman in this bar. He approaches, chats her up and asks for her number. Curious she accepts. She thinks he dresses nice. It appears he might have resources. I‚Äôll have to learn more about him to find out. They‚Äôre texting back and forth he takes the initiative to set up a date. It‚Äôs a coffee date. That‚Äôs weird. All her previous boyfriends took her to 4 star restaurants on the first date. Anyway she has 3-4 other men in her phone who seem sweet and are eager to take her out to something a lot fancier than coffee. She ghosts him. Naturally he becomes angry. Goes on about how all women want is money but wait! He‚Äôs also superficial. He just wanted her because she was the most beautiful woman in the bar.*

There seems to be a common sentiment among men who are frustrated with dating that women seem to be money obsessed. In reality, most women learn at a very early age what they can ‚Äúget‚Äù out of men. The majority of below average and average women are under no illusion that they can snag a wealth or high status man. The problem only arises when the average man thinks a 7-8 woman is in his league in reality her DMs are most likely filled with high status men asking her out. 

And frankly they shouldn‚Äôt be shamed for the preference. They‚Äôre using what they were blessed with (naturally or otherwise) to give a
man what he wants so she can secure resources for her and her offspring in the long term. 

I think a lot of people would be happier if they learned to date within their tax bracket for men and within their looks bracket for women. ",2,1745980750.0,PurplePillDebate,15,0.6,False

Both incidents were 100% my fault and could have been avoided. 

The first incident she was a couple of weeks old, I was extremely sleep deprived. She lost weight at my breast and had to go on formula bottles. She was allergic to cow‚Äôs milk and hated the formula, so she would just barely drink enough to fill her belly and be comfortable. This was after the first week of pretty much not sleeping because she was so hungry her body wouldn‚Äôt rest. Her infancy was HARD for a multitude of reasons. 

Fast forward, I‚Äôm in the mother‚Äôs room at buy buy baby sobbing because the bottle I made at home was in the insulation pocket and still too hot and she  was screaming to eat. I was on the phone with her father (whom I have since left) and he was telling me I was NOT allowed to give her my breast, scared she would refuse the bottles again. I cried that the bottle was too hot. I kept trying to pour it back and forth into an empty one- still too hot. I was panicking, escalating, after several minutes of trying to cool it down and her screaming, I gave up and cried and tried to give it to her. Her little body went into shock. She pulled off the nipple and went to sleep. I cried even harder after that, not knowing why on earth I listened to him, wishing I had put her on my breast. I was genuinely too scared not to listen to him, and I hurt her by giving her the hot bottle. 

She ended up with a swallowing disorder and not diagnosed for several months, but I wondered somehow if it was my fault. What if I burned her little flap that was supposed to keep the liquid out of her lungs and it was my fault in addition to the pain she felt? How bad was the pain? She didn‚Äôt scream, her eyes got huge, her body jolted, and she pulled off the nipple and slept. I‚Äôll never forget the look on her face and feeling like the worst mother that ever lived. I‚Äôve cried many times since then, and she is currently 5- almost 6 years old now. 

The other time was almost one year later. I gave her mashed potatoes from a restaurant without testing them first, and she screamed/panicked that they were hot on her tongue. I quickly brushed it off of her tongue and felt it was hot. I wondered how on earth I managed to hurt her not once, but twice, both with hot items. 

I‚Äôve never hurt her in any other way. I do not hit my child, and I‚Äôve gone above and beyond since to make sure I don‚Äôt give her hot food.

My problem is that when I remember these events, which are admittedly less often now, I feel sick. I wish it had been me that was burned instead. I remember after the first incident happened I wanted to go home, boil water, and force myself to drink it off the stove. I never did, because I knew that was a horrible intrusive thought that would fix nothing. 

I also felt incredibly suicidal after the first incident. I felt like I was the worst human for bringing a baby into the world only to hurt her, and to give her such a shitty father. It was so hard on me. I don‚Äôt know how hot it actually was in retrospect, maybe like a hot cup of coffee. 

I do not know how to forgive myself. I am happy that I am still here and I am so happy she is my daughter, but I fear this incidents will haunt me for the rest of my life. I do not know how to progress mentally past these feelings of almost being an imposter because- WHO hurts their kids by negligence???? I did. And it hurts me deeply. ",1,1745980487.0,Mom,0,1.0,False

1kb5ug8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1kb5ug8/i_feel_ashamed/,I feel ashamed,"I'm so ashamed of the life I'm currently living. I want you all to judge me. Psychiatrists say my childhood is at fault. But is it really? I'm currently turning 19. I was supposed to be finishing my last year of high school yet here I am. I haven't stepped foot there in 3 months. I tried twice during those months but felt like shit after each attempt. I have no one anymore besides my boyfriend which I depend on too much. I've always had difficulties with school with my siblings ever since we moved countries 10 years ago, we were raised in my mother's country but had to suddenly move because of my father's ""homesickness"" towards his country. Ever since we arrived here everything has gone down hill. Me and my siblings all developed severe issues the main one being isolation. My parents always worked, My sister being older like me also had difficulties adjusting to this different environment and authority (my grandma) and my brother was younger but still kind of in the same boat. Growing up until that point our parents never really disciplined us because my older sister had cancer when I was 3. She had a 10% chance of survival. They were devastated. My earliest of memories of life revolve around this tragedy. I can still remember myself clinging onto my mother whenever she had to leave to take care of our sister in the hospital. I would only see her once a month or every few months. I even ran after her one time while she was driving away. So basically from ages to 3-5 me and my brother didn't really have a mother hell he thought our grandma was his mother. During those difficult times my dad was again also absent because he had to work to pay for my sister's medical bills because we were and are still in debt. After my parents experienced that life changing event. Before and even after my sister got better, they would never tell us no, and they would spoil us like crazy with gifts attention etc as much as they could. Because they were afraid. Because they wanted us to be happy. Because they wanted us to forget. Because they wanted to make it up to us. But it was wrong. We never learnt rules. Those problems  hadn't manifested until we retuned to my father's country. They were absent again. So we were children who were thrown into an unfamiliar environment with no one to guide us. When our parents finally tried to intervene it was too late. My sister was already supposed to be in puberty but she couldn't even enter it because of the damage chemotherapy had caused to her body so she was a very angry child with a lot of resentment. Understandably so. I was already failing primary school because of the anxiety and depression I developed while being neglected. Not on purpose of course, everything they did they did for us. But the damage was still done. At this point my siblings and I were already in the process of isolating ourselves in our rooms. My sister and I used to be best friends until we moved here. We would play for hours together on end. But when we got here I'd bang on her door and cry for attention. She had completely closed off from everyone even me. I started being rebellious around this time I would get my brother and cause mischief all the time focusing especially more on my sister. I would have him piss on her door what the fuck was wrong with me. Despite just being a child when doing all of this silly stuff even when it was just my brother sometimes and not me I would be the one getting beaten with a stick by my grandma and not much later by my father when he saw that my absence marks weren't getting any better and that all of his children were out of control. All of this happened in the span of the first weeks here. So life was just my sister in her room closed off from everyone. Me doing the same while not attending school. My brother also participating in this but at a slower pace as he was younger and a boy. Every week my father would round us all up and scream at us call us useless and give us a speech about 2 hours infront of our frail and weak spoken mother who didn't dare intervene. Not much later my mom got cancer. My sister and I were teenagers so we had a perfect understanding of what was happening at the time. My father hadn't changed, in fact he had become worse because of the stress. It would be verbal abuse everyday. And when my mother got discharged she would have to face it too. Our family was in shambles. My father had his good moments but his bad ones overshadowed them big time. By the time he had started getting better it was too late. The damage had been done. My sister was already graduating. We would just avoid him whenever we walked past him in the house. Despite his moments he still tried his hardest with our mom to provide the best for us. I would always surely fail the year but they made it possible for me to pass with psychiatrist papers etc until well.. high school, it was harder to bypass the law with high school or to reason with them. But that was when I met Eve. The person that despite not even trying got me through my first two years. She was and still is my best fiend the person that just clicks with me. Whenever I didn't attend school she would come to my house and convince me to come back whenever I dreaded going she was there. The bad thing though was that eve was a year ahead of me. So when I entered my final year, eve had graduated. I thought I could handle this. So I tried a month in I was already having difficulties. I had lost all motivation, I had no friends there anymore. And whenever I tried to befriend someone I would realise that I just don't click with them and they were finding me bothersome since the groups had already formed. So I asked my parents if I could change schools maybe then I could find friends who could encourage me. At the time I discussed this also with my boyfriend Jay, jay and I had met in my second year of HS by pure coincidence. That's when he suggested to me that I transfer to his school. we both thought it was a great idea and my parents reluctantly agreed. The problem was that jay's high school was hours away so I would have to wake up at 5 am in the morning to take the bus and then still be late because it's never on time. Soon I started losing classes again but not because I didn't want to go but because the bus made it impossible. I started having anxiety attacks each morning because I thought my past was gonna catch up to me again. So after a long discussion my parents and I had decided it would be best if I moved there into an apartment so I wouldn't lose any more lessons. Long story short my parents decide to move back to mom's country because of job opportunities and they take my minor brother with them but leave me since I'm in my final year so I can just finish it. They didn't realise though that the cycle had started again even though I was attending the school I couldn't find anyone again to make friends with. A girlfriend. I was also way behind my peers in terms of education because I had gaps because of my previous years of no attendance. It all started building up and by the time they were gone it was the beginning of the end. I had started spiralling again. I had no one. My mom was the one that gave me confidence and now she was gone and so was eve. I had jay but it isn't the same. I don't understand why Jay hasn't given up on me or loves me. My spark is gone. So what does he see? All I've done these past 3 months is just bed rot. I'm too ashamed to go out I'm afraid of people seeing me. Especially my classmates because whenever I came back after taking time off they would attack me. I hate them. I hate this place. I've only got my dog and jay. I can barely take care of myself. Jay has been taking care of me for the past three months even though I don't deserve it. He walks the dog, brings me coffee EVERY SINGLE DAY. And yet I do nothing. I have no energy to do anything. I just want to be free. I know I'm not going back to high school. I don't know what my options are. Only my mom and jay know about this. I've told jay im planning to join my parents in my mothers country and maybe finish school there if it's possible. He wants to come with me. I don't know what I've done to deserve this man. Even though I was good to him when I was okay does that even cover these past 3 months? I've been a demon. An energy sucking demon. He says I'm not and that he loves me just as I am, but to be frank im kind of concerned with how okay he is with all of this. I think joining my parents is the only way to somehow get out of cycle. I need their support I don't want to rely solely on Jay, enough is enough. What I'm really trying to say is that I feel horrible. My parents left me behind with the expectations that I finish. They paid rent every month for me to finish. And yet I've accomplished nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm completely useless. Everyone around me thinks I'm this strong person who lives on her own and is trying to finish school on her own. But I'm not. I'm just some loser who can't even feed herself, get out of bed herself. Can't even go to school for a year. I know I'm probably going to get better if I join them but man I'm so ashamed, I even was on the verge of committing multiple times. I just feel so weak. What's the point of me even surviving ? I can't even express my feelings without crying. How am I supposed to survive in the real world? Nothing has changed since primary school. I'm still this person. I'm just better at hiding it.",1,1745980200.0,depression,0,1.0,False
1kb5trs,https://www.reddit.com/r/fnv/comments/1kb5trs/pointless_attempt_at_a_crafting_priority_list/,Pointless attempt at a crafting priority list. Stim-ply amazing!!,"K so I said I was gonna take a crack at this in the other thread, but it ended up being kinda meh but whatever. I learned at least one fun thing along the way.

So this list is built around the priority of making stimpaks (and therefore avoiding anything that conflicts ingredients). I will list all of these below, since it's long and funny and annoying. So let's start with some of the most OP items that don't conflict... (oh also this won't be for hardcore, just normal gameplay)


**|| Goated Recipes ||**  

(the obvious one) Wasteland Omelette, 240HP over a minute. Deathclaw egg, Lakelurk meat, Crunchy mutfruit, Blamco MacNcheeze

Thick Red Paste! 120HP over 30 seconds and maxHPbuff. Flour, mutant cave fungus, thin red paste (powerful in its own right).

Trail Mix, 75HP over 15 seconds and APbuff. Apple, pear, nuts, sugar bombs.

Mushroom Cloud, 60HP over 20 seconds and APbuff. Nightstalker egg, sugar bombs, gum drops.

And more basic ones like Fire Ant Fricasse, Brahmin Wellington, and Caravan Lunch (which is the best hardcore mode food in game, outside of MREs).


**|| Stim-ply Amazing!! ||**  

OK, so... The stimpak thing. Broc flower, xander root, empty syringe. Salient Green from OWB means we can turn those 2 ingredients into the aforementioned ingredients: banana yucca fruit, barrel cactus fruit, honey mesquite pod, jalapeno pepper, maize, nevada agave fruit, pinto bean pod, prickly pear fruit, & white horsenettle.

So if we only use those ingredients to make stimpaks (from salient green), that means we can no longer make slasher, turbo, coffee, salad, kebab, mantis, most stews, most brews including moonshine, tequilas, cactus water, flamer fuel, sausage, any tanned hide, and most tribal healing/poison.


**|| Sell these non-stim slackers... ||**  

And because those recipes are avoided it makes a few items 'obsolete' for crafting, such as bloatfly, mole rat, mantis, tobacco, spore pods, yeast, potatoes, coffee pots, glands from cazador and bark, wine/whiskey/beer, and to a certain extent hides/leather belts.

Funnily enough, dog hides GAIN one cap value as a belt... But coyote hides lose 2 caps value, so you can just sell them instead of processing em...

Also, for non-food/drink stuff...


**|| Surviving with more than stims... ||**  

There are 2 sources of antivenom. The typical nightstalker blood and radscorpion gland method, and the Lonesome Road surgical tubing and buffalo gourd seed method.

Also funny, just adding one ingredient to the antivenom makes 'Hydra', a limb restoration chem. Nightstalker blood, radscorpion gland, and cave fungus.

Also, the stimpak meta means you lose out on a LOT of poisons... But not all. So if you do want to use them for your melee character, your best options are mixing turpentine with either Honest Hearts datura root or Dead Moneys cloud with abraxo cleaner.

I also recommend saving fission batteries with scrap metal to spam sierra madre chips and buy... Well, stimpaks lol :)",1,1745980144.0,fnv,0,1.0,False
1kb5tga,https://youtu.be/Xo1OEYtrkOU,3 Very Scary TRUE Missing Hiker Horror Stories,"""**The Vanishing at Spence Field**"":

June 14, 1969. It was Father‚Äôs Day weekend, and the kind of morning that made you believe the world was at peace. The sky over the Great Smoky Mountains was washed in blue, the sun just cresting the ridgelines and filtering golden light through the tall canopy of oak and fir. The scent of pine needles, moss, and blooming wildflowers drifted through the cool mountain air, sharp and fresh, the way only the wilderness could offer. Everything felt right.

We were full of excitement, the kind that buzzes quietly just beneath the surface. My wife Violet had packed everyone‚Äôs things with care, double-checking the boys‚Äô jackets and canteens. Our sons, Dennis and Doug, were practically vibrating with energy. Dennis, only six, was on his first real camping trip‚Äîone where we'd hike deep into the mountains, sleep in tents, cook over open flame, and chase fireflies as the night settled around us. His red T-shirt practically glowed in the morning light, and his green shorts seemed to blur as he darted up the trail ahead of us, calling back over his shoulder.

‚ÄúDad, look at the mountains!‚Äù he shouted, his finger outstretched toward the sea of green ridges rolling off into the distance.

I smiled as I adjusted the straps on my pack. ‚ÄúPretty cool, huh? Stay close, buddy,‚Äù I said, though I already knew he wouldn‚Äôt‚Äîat least not for long. That‚Äôs how six-year-olds are, especially when they‚Äôre tasting real freedom for the first time.

Doug, who had just turned nine, trotted along behind us with a sort of older-brother superiority. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre so slow, Dennis,‚Äù he teased, kicking a rock off the path and watching it bounce into the underbrush.

Dennis only laughed, undeterred, and ran back toward me, his small hand finding mine. He looked up at me with those wide, dark brown eyes, full of life and curiosity, his cheeks flushed from the mountain air. I remember thinking: this‚Äîthis is what it‚Äôs all about.

Our trail started at Cades Cove, a place where the meadows stretched out like green blankets beneath the watchful gaze of the mountains. We hiked toward Russell Field, where we‚Äôd make camp for the night. The woods were alive with birdsong‚Äîwarblers, woodpeckers, the occasional crow‚Äîand the sound of the wind teasing the trees. Every once in a while, we‚Äôd hear a branch crack under the foot of a deer or the scurry of a squirrel racing up a trunk. Life was everywhere.

That night, as the fire crackled and the darkness swallowed the woods beyond our campsite, we sat together roasting marshmallows. The sweet smell of sugar melting over flames filled the air. My father, Clyde, sat beside me, gazing into the firelight with a nostalgic sort of softness.

‚ÄúRemember when we used to do this?‚Äù he asked quietly, his voice warm and gravelly.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, watching the boys chase fireflies just outside the circle of light. ‚ÄúNow it‚Äôs their turn.‚Äù

We didn‚Äôt need to say much more. Sometimes it‚Äôs enough to just share a silence like that.

The next morning broke clear and bright. The dew still clung to the grass, glistening in the sunlight. We made our way to Spence Field, a grassy clearing high up in the Smokies, just off the Appalachian Trail. You could see for miles from there‚Äîrolling ridges and valleys painted in every shade of green, with distant peaks fading into blue. It felt untouched, pure.

Another family had already arrived‚Äîthe Carters, with two boys close in age to ours. The kids wasted no time, as kids do. Within minutes, they were running around together like lifelong friends, giggling and plotting games with the urgency only children possess. They decided on hide-and-seek. Dennis was thrilled.

‚ÄúDennis, don‚Äôt go far,‚Äù I said as he took off toward the edge of the clearing, glancing back with a mischievous grin.

‚ÄúOkay, Dad!‚Äù he called, already halfway to the tree line.

We watched as the kids darted behind bushes and trees. Every so often, one would pop out, laughing or shouting ‚Äúfound you!‚Äù I remember checking my watch. It was about 11:30. A perfect morning. Nothing felt wrong.

Until it did.

Doug reappeared, cheeks red, eyes bright. The Carter boys ran out from their hiding places. But Dennis didn‚Äôt. We waited, at first amused, thinking he was just being clever. But as the seconds ticked by, that amusement turned into unease.

‚ÄúDennis! Come on out, the game‚Äôs over!‚Äù I shouted, walking toward the spot I‚Äôd last seen him. Nothing. No giggle, no rustling leaves. Just the wind.

‚ÄúViolet, you see him?‚Äù I asked, glancing around, my voice already tinged with tension.

She stood frozen for a second, then pointed. ‚ÄúHe was right there, behind that bush.‚Äù

We began calling his name, louder and louder. Clyde began checking behind trees, calling out. I broke into a jog, then a run, scanning the tree line, my pulse rising with every step. The Carters joined in. Their oldest boy started crying. Five minutes passed. Then ten. The forest was silent except for the frantic voices calling Dennis‚Äôs name.

My heart pounded in my ears. I yelled again, my voice cracking. ‚ÄúDennis!‚Äù

Violet came up behind me, her hand clutching my sleeve. ‚ÄúHe wouldn‚Äôt just run off, William. He wouldn‚Äôt.‚Äù

‚ÄúI know,‚Äù I said, barely able to speak. ‚ÄúI know. But we need to keep looking.‚Äù

We scoured the field and the trails leading away from it. We checked behind logs, inside bushes, along creeks. No red shirt. No footprints in the dirt. No broken twigs, no candy wrappers, no sign that a little boy had ever been there. It was like he‚Äôd been plucked from the earth.

Tom Carter offered to run back to the ranger station. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe need help.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said, gripping his shoulder. ‚ÄúHurry.‚Äù

Rangers arrived by mid-afternoon. Ranger Harris, a tall, wiry man with a calm demeanor, stepped forward, his notepad in hand. ‚ÄúWhen did you last see him?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight around 11:30. He was maybe 50 feet away. He was just hiding‚Äîthen he was gone.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôll set up a grid search,‚Äù Harris said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got protocols for this. We‚Äôll find him.‚Äù

But nothing in the world felt like a guarantee anymore. More rangers showed up, then volunteers, and soon the field was a hive of movement‚Äîmen with radios, dogs, maps, flashlights. I remember seeing the helicopter rise up over the trees that evening, the thumping of its blades echoing like a heartbeat.

The sun sank behind the mountains, and shadows took over. Spence Field, which had seemed so alive and open that morning, now felt cold and vast. Violet clutched Doug tightly. He was crying into her shoulder.

‚ÄúIs Dennis lost, Dad?‚Äù he asked me, his voice small.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre gonna find him,‚Äù I said. But my voice trembled.

I didn‚Äôt sleep that night. I just sat in the dark, listening. The forest was too quiet. Every rustle made me jump. I thought I heard whispers in the wind, imagined footsteps beyond the trees. But it was just the mountain. Or maybe not.

By morning, the search doubled in size. The National Guard came. Green Berets. Dozens, then hundreds of people combed the area, calling out, scanning the ground. I walked until my legs gave out, my throat raw from shouting. I listened for a laugh, a cry, anything. But there was only silence.

On the third day, the rain came. A cold, unrelenting downpour that soaked everything and turned the dirt trails into rivers of mud. Fog rolled in like a ghost, wrapping the mountain in silence and gray. Harris found me near a creek, my clothes soaked through, my boots squelching in the mud.

‚ÄúThe rain‚Äôs making it worse,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs washing everything away. Tracks, scent trails. All of it.‚Äù

I stared into the woods, then back at him. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs out there,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs out there. You have to keep looking.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe are,‚Äù he said. But his eyes were tired, the kind of tired that comes when you start to lose hope.

Someone found a shred of red fabric caught on a thorn bush. My heart skipped. I ran over, breath caught in my throat.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the same material,‚Äù Harris said, gently holding it out. ‚ÄúSorry.‚Äù

Another volunteer thought she heard laughter echoing from deep in the woods. We ran toward it, machetes in hand, cutting through brush and bramble. But there was nothing. Just trees and silence. False hope can break you worse than fear.

The days blurred. One became five. Five became ten. More than 1,400 people joined the search. Nothing. Not a footprint. Not a thread. Not a whisper. Just emptiness. Theories started to spread‚Äîhe got lost, fell, was taken. Some rangers whispered about wild animals. Others, about something worse.

After sixteen days, Harris sat us down. His voice was low, careful. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve covered every inch we can. We‚Äôre scaling back.‚Äù

Violet broke. She sobbed into my chest, and I couldn‚Äôt hold myself up. I collapsed with her. I wanted to scream, to tear into the mountains and rip the truth from them. But they were silent.

We packed up. Left the field. Left the camp. Left part of our hearts behind. At home, nothing was right. The world kept turning, but slower. Every knock on the door, every phone ring‚Äîhope would flare and die.

In 1985, a ginseng hunter claimed he found a child‚Äôs skeleton deep in the park. Rangers searched, but they found nothing. In 2022, the FBI released old case files. Still no answers.

It‚Äôs been more than fifty years. We never found Dennis. Never knew if he got lost, if he was taken, if the mountains simply swallowed him whole. The not-knowing is the heaviest weight.



Sometimes, I still dream of him. His red shirt, his laugh, his hand in mine. Sometimes I hear his voice in the woods behind our house. Then I wake up. And it‚Äôs just the wind again. The wind, and the ache.







**""The Bearings of Belanglo"":**

Orienteering has always been more than just a hobby for me‚Äîit‚Äôs a way of thinking, a way of being. Give me a topographic map, a compass, and a thick forest, and I‚Äôll disappear for hours, chasing bearings, plotting points, solving nature like a living maze. There‚Äôs something about reading the land, matching every ridge and contour line to the world beneath my boots, that just makes sense. Some people meditate. I hike and navigate.

On September 19, 1992, a cool Saturday morning, my buddy Sam and I loaded our gear into his clunky old Toyota‚Äîrust around the wheel wells, cassette deck jammed on a Midnight Oil tape‚Äîand headed out to Belanglo State Forest. We were looking for new terrain, something more challenging than the usual parks and reserves near Sydney. Belanglo had a reputation among bushwalkers‚Äîdense, wild, untouched in parts. Perfect for an all-day orienteering challenge. The drive took about two hours, the kind of time that melts away with the right company. Sam never shut up‚Äîalways cracking jokes, arguing about what snack was best for the trail (he swore by barbecue Shapes, I stuck to scroggin), and teasing me about my obsession with laminated maps.

The forest greeted us with that sharp, spicy scent of eucalyptus and the quiet hum of remoteness. The parking area wasn‚Äôt much‚Äîjust a wide patch of dirt off a service road‚Äîbut to us, it was the starting line. Sam pulled his compass out like he was drawing a sword. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs gonna be great, mate,‚Äù he said, lobbing a warm water bottle at me. ‚ÄúBet I beat you to the first checkpoint.‚Äù

I laughed, shaking my head. ‚ÄúYou got turned around at Lane Cove, remember? We had to follow dog tracks out.‚Äù

He grinned and took off down the trail, boots kicking up dust. I checked my map one last time, dialed in my azimuth, and followed him in. The light filtered through the high canopy in slanted rays, and the underbrush was thick enough to slow us but not enough to obscure the land features. We placed our first few flags‚Äînothing fancy, just bright orange streamers tied to low branches‚Äîand took notes on the terrain. It was everything we‚Äôd hoped for: gullies, rocky outcrops, and enough quiet that the birds sounded like they were performing just for us.

About an hour in, we were well off the established path. We‚Äôd cut east by northeast to a low ridge that should‚Äôve led us to a dry creek bed, and I was adjusting our route when Sam stopped. He wasn‚Äôt laughing anymore. He stood still, staring about twenty meters ahead into the brush.

‚ÄúHold up, Alex,‚Äù he said, squinting. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that over there?‚Äù

I followed his gaze. Just beyond the ridge, a mound lay beneath a loose covering of branches and dried leaves. It wasn‚Äôt shaped like any fallen tree or scrub pile. Too symmetrical. Too deliberate. Something about it looked... wrong. Like someone had tried to make it look accidental and just missed the mark.

‚ÄúProbably just a pile of storm debris,‚Äù I offered, but I didn‚Äôt believe it. There was a tightness in my chest. A quiet alarm.

Then came the smell. It didn‚Äôt hit all at once, just sort of crept in like a sour fog‚Äîrot, wet earth, something organic breaking down in a way the forest couldn‚Äôt disguise. I saw Sam‚Äôs nose wrinkle.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs check it out,‚Äù he said, but his voice didn‚Äôt sound curious anymore. It sounded cautious. Edged.

I hesitated. Everything in my gut said turn around. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know, man. Something feels off.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, don‚Äôt be a wuss,‚Äù he said with a shaky laugh, trying to shrug it off like always. But even he didn‚Äôt sound convinced.

He stepped forward, and I followed, picking my way through dry brush and avoiding the low-hanging limbs. The smell was thicker the closer we got‚Äîmeaty, pungent, unmistakably wrong. When we reached the mound, I saw it. A hand. Sticking out like a white root from beneath the pile, fingers curled slightly, skin pale and mottled. Human.

I stopped cold. ‚ÄúSam,‚Äù I whispered, my voice nearly lost in the breeze. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a person.‚Äù

He took a step back, his face going white. ‚ÄúNah, nah, can‚Äôt be. It‚Äôs probably just‚Ä¶ a dead roo or something, a weird angle.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt reply. I couldn‚Äôt. I was already crouching, using a long stick to push aside some of the branches. More of the body came into view‚Äîjeans, a torn shirt soaked with old blood, skin gone waxy. And her eyes‚Ä¶ open, glazed, staring through us. Her chest was still, her face twisted in pain. She couldn‚Äôt have been older than twenty-five.

I gagged, stumbled back, barely holding down the water I‚Äôd just drunk. Sam had gone completely still, his lips moving like he was trying to speak but couldn‚Äôt form the words.

‚ÄúOh God, Sam,‚Äù I managed. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs been murdered.‚Äù

His hands were shaking now. ‚ÄúWhat do we do? Alex, what the hell do we do?‚Äù

I had to force myself to think. To not lose it. ‚ÄúWe leave. Now. We call the cops.‚Äù

The forest didn‚Äôt feel like the same place anymore. The light was still golden, but it felt cold. The silence was heavier. Every snapping twig sounded like something watching us, following. I stuffed the map back in my bag without folding it, and we half-walked, half-ran toward the car. Sam tripped over a root and swore, and I nearly dropped my compass, fumbling to get the keys out as we reached the clearing. I don‚Äôt think either of us even took off our packs‚Äîwe just climbed into the car and tore down the gravel road, dust billowing behind us.

Berrima wasn‚Äôt far, but the drive felt endless. Every corner we turned, every tree that rushed past, felt like it might reveal something else‚Äîanother body, a car pulled to the side, someone stepping out of the woods. When we finally pulled into the police station, we were sweating and wild-eyed, stumbling over each other to explain.

The officer at the desk blinked at us like he wasn‚Äôt sure we were real. ‚ÄúYou found¬†*what*¬†in Belanglo?‚Äù

‚ÄúA body,‚Äù I said again, trying not to break down. ‚ÄúA woman. We didn‚Äôt touch much. It‚Äôs covered, but it‚Äôs her. She‚Äôs‚Ä¶ gone.‚Äù

He stood up, no more hesitation, grabbed a radio, and called it in. Within minutes, we were seated in a side office, going over the details again and again, pointing out the location on a larger map he brought out from a filing cabinet. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll need to take us there,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúCan you do that?‚Äù

We could. And we did. That return walk through the forest was the longest hike of my life. The smell found us before the body did, just like before. Only this time, the officers were with us. One of them, a woman with sharp eyes and a thick ponytail, knelt down and confirmed what we already knew.

‚ÄúThis is a crime scene. Stay back. Don‚Äôt touch anything else.‚Äù

They asked everything. When we‚Äôd arrived. What we‚Äôd seen. Who we‚Äôd talked to. If we‚Äôd noticed anyone else in the area. My mind was a blur, my nerves shot. I answered what I could. Sam barely spoke.

We were told to leave after they secured the area. We drove back to Sydney in silence, the weight of what we‚Äôd seen settling in like a thick fog. I kept seeing her eyes. That hand. The stillness. Sam looked straight ahead, jaw clenched tight. We didn‚Äôt even stop for food.

It wasn‚Äôt long before we heard her name: Joanne Walters. An English backpacker. A day later, they found Caroline Clarke nearby‚Äîanother young woman. She‚Äôd been shot. Executed, almost. The news exploded with the story. And months after that, they caught the man responsible‚Äî**Ivan Milat**. Seven confirmed victims, all travelers. Killed in the same forest we‚Äôd spent hours navigating like it was some kind of game.

I never went back to orienteering after that. Gave away my compass, folded up my maps for the last time. The bush, once a place of challenge and freedom, now felt like a graveyard. Sam and I drifted apart‚Äînot in a dramatic way, just quietly. Like two people who couldn‚Äôt share the same air anymore without remembering what we‚Äôd seen. I tried talking about it a few times, but every time I did, I saw her face again. Those eyes.

Now, every forest I pass looks different. Not mysterious, not inviting‚Äîjust dangerous. Every night, I double check the locks. Sometimes I wake up thinking I smell that sour, rotten scent again. But mostly, I just try to forget what we found that day. Try, and fail.



Because Belanglo showed me the worst kind of fear‚Äîthe human kind. The kind that wears a face and walks upright and knows exactly what it‚Äôs doing. And it waits in the quiet places, the beautiful ones, where no one ever thinks to look.







""**The Night Evelyn Vanished**"":

It was October 24, 1953, a chilly Saturday night in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The air outside had the kind of bite that hinted at an early winter, and the wind rustled dry leaves along the sidewalk in whispering little bursts. My daughter, Evelyn, was fifteen‚Äîjust fifteen‚Äîbut she had an old soul. Thoughtful, kind, always eager to help. She had a bright mind and a brighter heart, the kind of girl teachers adored and neighbors trusted. That night, she was babysitting for the Rasmusens, a young couple who lived just a few blocks away. They had a new baby, barely a year old, and Evelyn loved kids. She had promised to call us at 8:30, just to check in, like she always did.

The clock on the mantle chimed half past eight. I glanced up, expecting the phone to ring any second. But it didn‚Äôt. At first, I brushed it off. Maybe the baby was fussy, or Evelyn had dozed off on the couch. But then 8:40 came. Then 8:45. I stood up, heart starting to thud. Something wasn‚Äôt right.

‚ÄúMargaret,‚Äù I called to my wife, who was curled up in the armchair, her knitting needles clicking softly in the quiet room. ‚ÄúEvelyn hasn‚Äôt called. She‚Äôs never late.‚Äù

Margaret looked up, her eyes narrowing in concern. ‚ÄúMaybe she‚Äôs just busy. You know how babies can be.‚Äù

I nodded slowly, but something deep in my gut twisted. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone and dialed the Rasmusens' number. It rang once. Twice. Then five times. Ten. No answer. I hung up, pulse pounding in my ears. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going over there,‚Äù I said, grabbing my coat off the hook near the door. Margaret didn‚Äôt say a word. She just put down her knitting and followed me out, her face drawn tight with worry.

The streets were quiet as we drove, headlights cutting through the dense fog rolling in from the river. Streetlamps glowed hazy and yellow, casting long shadows across the sidewalk. Every second felt like an hour. I kept imagining Evelyn curled up on the sofa, asleep, unaware of our panic. I prayed that‚Äôs what we‚Äôd find.

The Rasmusens' house looked normal at first. Lights on in the living room. Curtains drawn. A soft glow spilling out onto the porch. But the moment I stepped out of the car, I felt it‚Äîan unnatural stillness. No sounds of laughter, no baby crying, no movement at all. I knocked hard on the front door.

‚ÄúEvelyn? You there?‚Äù I called out. Nothing. The only sound was a faint jazz tune playing on the radio inside, crackly and distant. I knocked again, louder. The baby should‚Äôve stirred. Someone should‚Äôve answered. My hand tightened on the doorknob. Locked.

‚ÄúTry the back,‚Äù Margaret whispered.

We hurried around the side of the house, our breath hanging in the cold air. The back door was locked, too. I banged my fist against it, calling Evelyn‚Äôs name. Still nothing. I looked at the living room window‚Äîone of the side panes was cracked open. Just a few inches. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going in,‚Äù I said, pushing it up farther.

‚ÄúRichard, be careful,‚Äù Margaret whispered, but I was already climbing through.

My feet hit the hardwood floor with a dull thud. The air inside was cold, unnaturally so, and something was wrong. The room was in disarray. A dining chair was tipped on its side. Evelyn‚Äôs books‚Äîher schoolbooks‚Äîwere strewn across the floor like they‚Äôd been knocked off the coffee table. Her eyeglasses lay near the rug, bent at the frame, one lens cracked clean through. My stomach dropped.

‚ÄúEvelyn?‚Äù I called, louder now, more frantic.

I turned toward the crib. The baby was there‚Äîthank God. Sound asleep, cheeks pink with warmth. But Evelyn was nowhere. Margaret climbed in behind me and gasped when she saw the mess.

‚ÄúWhat happened here?‚Äù she asked, her voice trembling.

I didn‚Äôt answer. I was already moving toward the hallway. The kitchen was dark, the faucet dripping. The air was still. Then I saw it. A dark stain on the hardwood, just a small drop at first. Then another. Leading toward the basement door. My breath caught in my throat.

‚ÄúMargaret, stay here,‚Äù I said, though I‚Äôm not sure she heard me.

I opened the basement door. A cold, musty draft drifted up from below. I descended slowly, my hand trailing along the wall. The light down there was dim, a single bare bulb swaying slightly from the ceiling. The air smelled of damp earth and motor oil. More blood. A trail, faint but clear, leading to the far corner of the basement near the window well. There, the screen had been slashed, the window glass shoved inward. Below it, a large smear of blood, and scattered around‚Äîshoe prints. A man‚Äôs boots. And Evelyn‚Äôs smaller footprints, partially smudged.

‚ÄúRichard!‚Äù Margaret‚Äôs voice echoed from above. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs more blood out here!‚Äù

I bolted up the stairs, two at a time. Margaret was standing near the front rug, her hand shaking as she pointed. More blood. Tiny drops, a spatter, leading toward the front door. Panic gripped me in full. I grabbed the phone, my fingers numb as I dialed the operator.

Within minutes, police sirens wailed through the fog. Red and blue lights flashed across the quiet houses. Neighbors peeked through curtains. Detective Roy Johnson was the first to arrive‚Äîa tall man with a weary expression and a sharp eye. He took one look at the house and nodded grimly.

‚ÄúTell me everything,‚Äù he said, pulling out a small notebook.

I tried to stay calm as I spoke, but my voice kept breaking. ‚ÄúShe was supposed to call us at 8:30. She‚Äôs never late. We came here, found the house locked. Room was a mess. Blood in the basement. Her glasses are broken. And she‚Äôs gone.‚Äù

Johnson listened, his eyes scanning every corner. Margaret was holding Evelyn‚Äôs scarf in her hands, the one she‚Äôd worn earlier that day. It was still warm from her neck.

‚ÄúAny enemies? Anyone who‚Äôd want to hurt her?‚Äù Johnson asked.

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Margaret choked out. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs a sweet girl. Everyone loves her.‚Äù

The police spread out. They checked every room, every drawer. They found two distinct sets of footprints in the basement. One matched Evelyn‚Äôs. The other‚Äîlarger, heavier‚Äîwas unfamiliar. Outside, they followed the blood trail through the yard. It led to the sidewalk, then abruptly stopped. Like someone had dragged her into a car. No tire tracks in the fog-damp grass, but neighbors were starting to talk.

Mrs. Carter, from across the street, said she saw a light-colored car circling the block earlier. ‚ÄúAround 7:30, I think,‚Äù she whispered. ‚ÄúLooked out of place.‚Äù

‚ÄúDid you see who was in it?‚Äù I asked.

‚ÄúToo dark. But I heard a scream. Just for a second. Thought it was kids playing.‚Äù

Another neighbor, Ed Hofer, claimed he saw a green two-toned Buick speeding away around 8:15. ‚ÄúBack wheels fish-tailed on the corner. Thought the driver was drunk. Swore I saw someone in the back seat‚Ä¶ maybe a girl.‚Äù

My heart felt like it would rip open. I wanted to chase that car, even now, hours too late. The police combed the neighborhood, knocked on every door, took statements from every witness. They sent blood samples to the lab, dusted the basement for prints. But so far‚Äîno Evelyn.

Detective Johnson pulled me aside near dawn. ‚ÄúMr. Hartley,‚Äù he said gently. ‚ÄúYou need to prepare yourself. This doesn‚Äôt look good.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat are you saying?‚Äù I snapped, angry now. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs out there. You can still find her!‚Äù

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre doing everything we can,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut the scene‚Ä¶ the blood, the signs of a struggle, the car sightings‚Ä¶ it looks like an abduction.‚Äù

I wanted to collapse. But I couldn‚Äôt. Not while she was still out there. Not while there was still a chance.

The days that followed were a nightmare. Search parties combed the woods. Police patrolled highways. The local paper ran Evelyn‚Äôs photo every day. Volunteers handed out flyers. Someone thought they saw her in St. Paul. Another tip came from a diner off Highway 35. Nothing panned out.

A week later, a farmer found a torn piece of fabric near a fence along Highway 14. It was bloodstained. Later, they found undergarments in a ditch, and a pair of shoes‚ÄîEvelyn‚Äôs shoes. The soles matched prints from the basement. Then, a month later, a denim jacket was found in the woods, near a drainage culvert. Blood on the collar. It was her type.

The evidence kept piling up, and every piece was another nail in the coffin of hope. But no body. No Evelyn.

Rumors began to spread. About a man named Edward Gein from Plainfield‚Äîa strange loner, a handyman with a dark past. After he was arrested in 1957 for unspeakable crimes, people started whispering. Maybe he had something to do with Evelyn‚Äôs disappearance. Maybe he was the monster we‚Äôd all feared.

But there was no proof. Only questions. Only silence.

We never stopped looking. Never stopped hoping. Every knock at the door, every late-night call, I prayed it was her. But it never was. Sometimes I still dream of that night‚Äîof her glasses on the rug, of the baby‚Äôs quiet breathing, of the blood on the basement floor.



Who took my daughter? Why? I still ask those questions. I whisper them into the dark when sleep won‚Äôt come. And after all these years, the silence is still the only answer I get.",1,1745980115.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Here's the beginning context.  I (F) have been married to my husband for 20+ years. We have two kids.  He's in a job he can't wait to retire from.  I recently finished a doctorate and am trying to get licensed for my new profession. I work at least 40 hours a week (WFH), plus take care of groceries, laundry, most of the house cleaning, most of the picking up of a child from school, and studying for the licensing exam.  He works up to 40 hours a week plus works some varying hours a week in his side-hustle. He handles the taking to school in the morning.

The licensing exam has been kicking my ass. I am trying to keep focuses on it, but I am doing all this other stuff. I am trying so hard. Like, SO HARD. I'm loosing faith and focus and hope. I'm close to spiraling. Am I danger to myself or others - Absolutely not.  But depressed as hell and filled with anxiety?  Yes.

Situation:

My job has me working extra hours (yay OT?) but my husband is acting out.  He's mad that I can't drop everything to Google something or look something up when needs it.  Cause he's busy.  He's mad that I was annoyed yesterday after working over 10+hrs and studying that I tried to ask him about a dinner plan.  He was napping.  I sucked it up, was going to log out of work earlier than planned to handle dinner, but he lost his shit ""I'LL GET DINNER!""  I say I was going to do it. I try to say I was just asking him what he wanted.  Nothing.  Whatever, fine. Handle dinner.  It was at this point, I started getting the silent treatment.    Fine, so I SEND HIM A MESSAGE since he won't talk to me and is 4 feet away - I apologize if I snapped. I explain I'm tired. Very tired.  I am doing my best.  Give me a little grace if I can't keep handling it all.  Silence.

Today.

Today the silent treatment continues til dinner (which I thought I avoided by throwing something in the crockpot). Even made him a coffee this morning when I made mine, he ignored it and didn't touch it.

When I try talk to him, he tells me he's pissed about what I said to him and that clearly he's not allowed to nap. (never said that)  He's mad that I told him he's worthless and that everything is his fault (never said that).  He tells me I'm being childish because I tried to take his plate after dinner, and without saying a word to me, pulled it away from me.   So I go out, put dinner away, start cleaning up the kitchen.  He finally comes out and gets pissed he wanted more dinner.  So I say, you could have told me you wanted more instead of silently pulling your plate away from me.

He tells me he doesn't want to talk to me cause he's offended at what I said yesterday.  He tells me that I'M in the wrong for how I talked to him.  So I ask him, but giving me the silent treatment is mature?   Admittedly, I'm at my wit's end.  I usually choose my words carefully,  but at this point, I am just really mad and hurt.

Mentally/emotionally killed myself to get this degree to help my family.

I'm sorry that I'm not licensed yet so you can retire from the job you hate.

I'm sorry that I don't have enough hours in a day to do all the things I need to do, including studying for the licensing exam.

I had a very light schedule compared to most (6 units last semester due to the course I dropped was 4 and insanely hard and stressful, and the semester before that 9 units). Normally it would be 12 units but I am also with my school's disabilities program so it was a lowered requirement.

She says I take everything too easy, that I have to be either a full time student or working. I wish it was that easy. 

I have hypersomnia and always feel tired, no matter what I'm doing. It's like I'm always working at half capacity. I'm geninuely scared if I drank something like coffee (which I haven't tried before) and it made me feel awake, I would become addicted. 

My parents think a major factor of my constant tiredness is likely due to a lack of protein (which could be the case), but I also happen to be diagnosed with ARFID (Avoident/Restrictive Feeding Intake Disorder), which is essentially a much worse and medically diagnosed version of a picky eater. Lots of foods that contain lots of proteins I feel a visceral sense of disgust towards, which doesn't help.



I feel lost where I want to go in the world. I wanted to be a nurse but the anatomy class basically gave me a mental breakdown, decided I didn't want to go down that path and was sick off and on the entire semester which severly impacted my ability to do my work (the reasons i withdrew)

I've been considering another field (a class im taking on the subject which I'm greatly enjoying), but I just.... feel behind my siblings.

My older brother (25) is in the military and across the country. He's dealing with some things as well but he knows what he wants to do. 

My younger sister (17) wants to go into hospitality, and right after my mom learned about my situation my sister came and told her she has the opportunity to apply for a four year full ride into a college. Which I'm incredibly happy about! Though it does feel a bit like salt in the wound.

My dad came in as I was writing this on my phone. Told me he loves me, but is also very disappointed in me and that there will be consequences.

I have my whole life ahead of me, yet it feels like there's nothing there. I feel lacking in direction and general happiness.

 Wish i could just do what they do in those movies, leave and join a small town where an old grandma gives you housing as you work odd jobs and have a journey of self-discovery. Though that definitely isn't happening in this economy.

1kb5dtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Cameras/comments/1kb5dtw/2000_budget_please_help_tt/,"$2000 budget, please help T-T","* **Budget**:  Under $2000 USD (including lens), but I would like recommendations for lower price-points as well (I'm a student who has been saving up, but it's still a lot).
* **Country**: USA
* **Condition**: Ideally new, only used if near-perfect condition.
* **Type of Camera**: Prefer mirrorless, DSLR allowable. Needs to be pretty hefty, can't stand compact cameras.
* **Intended use**: 99% photography, but I would like to use it for some home videos occasionally.
* **If photography; what style**: Travel, food/coffee, occasionally portraits.
* **If video what style**: Just home videos, mostly for memories I don't need some crazy capabilities.
* **What features do you absolutely need**: Decent AF, not taking sports photos or anything, just impatient. Full-size, I love the feel of holding the side of the camera and the lens to stabilize. Future-proofing, I'm going to keep this for a very very long time.
* **What features would be nice to have**: Weatherproofing, I occasionally hike around waterfalls so I'd like this camera to be able to photograph them as well.
* **Portability**: Has to fit in a camera bag, but that's not really limiting. I doubt anything in my price range would exceed that size.
* **Cameras you're considering**: Fujifilm X-T5, I love the design and size, and the quality seems very good. Definitely the top contender so far, but it is pretty expensive. Sony A7III, my dream camera has always been the A7IV but I just don't have the money for it.
* **Cameras you already have**: I've been shooting on a Canon EOS 40D with a prime lens for literally my whole life (passed down from my Dad). Love the profile, love how crisp the photos are, but I just can't stand the terrible response in various lighting conditions.
* **Notes**: I won't be going crazy on the editing - I've edited thousands of photos for different work I've done for coffee brands, and I'd still edit any photos I'd plan on posting, but I want the colors to look good stock. I take a lot of travel photos and photos of events with my friends and family, so I want to just be able to view them and send them out looking pretty good without spending hours on editing them. The only other note I have is that the main reason I haven't looked into getting another Canon is I just don't like the super rounded design, but I'd definitely be open to a Canon if it's a good recommendation, especially since I already have the lens. I'd also love it if people had recommendations for accessories for the cameras they recommend (mainly straps/grips, SD cards, and filters).",0,1745978765.0,Cameras,2,0.5,False

I have tried quitting coffee/tea 10x over the course of 20 years to no avail. I have a plan in place to solve the caffeine issue (Dose the caffeine supplementally. There are some high-quality ones on Amazon which aren‚Äôt that expensive).

That leaves the water bottle. I know a lot of people are good with rocking a Nalgene bottle or plastic Gatorade bottle from 2003 and just drinking tap water since 2003 but that isn‚Äôt me. I have gone through so many water bottles over the years. Not sure if it‚Äôs realistic to think there is a magic one as many of the ones I have used are high quality. 

There is still a part of me that holds out hope that  somewhere out there is the holy grail of water bottles.

Setting: Griffin living room. The family is sprawled on the couch, snacks scattered, watching TV in their usual chaotic setup.

[**The living room is a mess of chip bags and soda cans, the TV casting a harsh glow. The Griffins slouch in their usual spots, a picture of dysfunctional comfort.*]

Peter: ""Lois, this show‚Äôs lamer than Meg‚Äôs social life!""

[Peter leans back, tossing popcorn toward his mouth, missing half and letting it fall on his stained shirt. His smug grin and careless toss show he‚Äôs relishing his jab at Meg, oblivious to her feelings. The clutter around him mirrors his carefree attitude.]

Meg: sighs ""Why do I even try?""

[Meg slumps deeper into the couch‚Äôs corner, arms crossed, staring at the floor. Her sigh is heavy, showing her resignation to the family‚Äôs mockery, her body language screaming defeat.]

Stewie: ""Meg, you‚Äôre the human equivalent of a ‚Äòlow battery‚Äô warning‚Äîannoying and ignorable.""

[Stewie, perched on Lois‚Äôs lap, smirks and waves his tiny hand dismissively at Meg. His sharp tone and exaggerated eye-roll emphasize his cruel wit, playing up his precocious menace.]

The TV interrupts with a breaking news alert: President Donald Trump is addressing the nation about a meteor shower approaching the East Coast, including Quahog, joined by tech billionaire Elon Musk.

[The TV screen flashes to a White House podium, Trump‚Äôs hair glowing under lights, Musk fidgeting beside him. The Griffin family leans forward, snacks forgotten, drawn to the spectacle. The room‚Äôs dim lighting contrasts the TV‚Äôs bright glare.]

Tom Tucker and Diane Simmons briefly appear on the Quahog News desk, introducing the White House feed.

[Tom sits rigidly, adjusting his tie, flashing a plastic smile, while Diane shuffles papers, her expression strained. The news desk‚Äôs bright lights and cheesy backdrop scream local TV. Their quick cameo, lasting a second, sets up the national broadcast, their professionalism clashing with the absurdity to come.]

Trump (on TV): ""Folks, these meteors? Tremendous. Beautiful. Like fireworks, but better. Elon‚Äôs here, great guy, says we‚Äôre fine!""

[Trump gestures wildly with both hands, pointing at Musk, then jabbing a thumb at himself. His broad grin and puffed chest show his confidence, downplaying the crisis to maintain control. The White House press room buzzes with reporters scribbling.]

Musk (on TV): ""Yeah, my Neuralink satellites are tracking it. Worst case, we colonize Mars. No biggie.""

[Musk shifts awkwardly, one hand in his pocket, the other scratching his head. His half-smile and distant gaze suggest he‚Äôs improvising, more focused on his next big idea than the immediate threat. A Neuralink logo flashes on a screen behind him.]

Brian: ""Are they seriously downplaying a meteor shower? This could wipe us out.""

[Brian sits up straight, ears perked, one paw pointing at the TV. His wide eyes and tense posture show genuine alarm, contrasting the family‚Äôs apathy. He‚Äôs trying to jolt them into reality.]

Peter: ""Relax, Brian. Trump and Musk? Dream team! Like me at a hot dog-eating contest!""

[Peter slaps Brian‚Äôs back, laughing, then mimics chugging a beer. His relaxed sprawl and dopey grin reflect blind faith in Trump and Musk, ignoring the danger for the sake of hero-worship.]

Cutaway gag: Peter choking at a hot dog contest while Trump cheers, ‚ÄúEat faster, Fat Peter, it‚Äôs yuge!‚Äù and Musk drones on about Tesla hot dogs.

[In the cutaway, Peter‚Äôs face turns red, hot dogs stuffed in his cheeks, flailing arms as he chokes. Trump waves a tiny flag, bouncing excitedly in the crowd, while Musk stands stiffly, holding a Tesla-branded hot dog, monologuing to no one. The chaotic scene captures Peter‚Äôs gluttony and the duo‚Äôs absurdity.]

Act 1: The Setup
Setting: Quahog streets, bustling with confused residents, and the Quahog Observatory, a cluttered lab with blinking monitors.

[**Quahog‚Äôs streets are chaotic, with residents scrambling for supplies, while the observatory hums with scientific gear, monitors flashing data, and star charts pinned to walls.*]

- Meg, fed up with her family‚Äôs constant mockery, volunteers at the Quahog Observatory to track the meteors, hoping to earn respect. She bonds with Dr. Nebula, a cynical scientist who sees potential in Meg.

[Meg trudges through Quahog‚Äôs chaotic streets, head down, dodging people panic-buying supplies. At the observatory, she straightens up, eagerly adjusting telescopes, her face lighting up as Dr. Nebula nods approvingly. Meg‚Äôs purposeful movements show her rare chance to shine, while Dr. Nebula‚Äôs casual lean and coffee-sipping vibe grounds their bond.]

- Meanwhile, Peter and the Griffins are obsessed with a Trump-led ‚ÄúNational Meteor Watch Party‚Äù broadcast from the White House, where Trump and Musk hype the meteor shower as a patriotic spectacle.

[The Griffins huddle around the TV, Peter waving a tiny American flag, Lois nervously clutching a pillow, Chris munching chips, and Stewie fiddling with a toy laser gun. Their fixation on the broadcast, with scattered snacks and glowing screens, shows their distraction from reality.]

Trump (on TV): ""Biggest meteor party ever! Live from D.C.! Buy my Meteor MAGA hats‚Äîbest protection!""

[Trump holds up a red ‚ÄúMeteor MAGA‚Äù hat, spinning it on his finger like a basketball, grinning at the camera. His showman antics, with exaggerated winks, aim to distract from the crisis and boost sales. The White House set sparkles with tacky gold decorations.]

Musk (on TV): ""And my Starlink Meteor Shield subscriptions! Only $99 a month to beam away space rocks. Sign up on X!""

[Musk taps furiously on a tablet, barely looking up, his voice monotone yet manic. He‚Äôs pitching his tech with detached enthusiasm, more interested in branding than practicality. A Starlink satellite model spins behind him, slightly off-kilter.]

Lois: ""Peter, shouldn‚Äôt we be preparing, not partying?""

[Lois leans forward, hands wringing the pillow, her furrowed brow showing worry. She‚Äôs trying to be the voice of reason, but her hesitant tone suggests she‚Äôs swayed by Peter‚Äôs optimism.]

Peter: ""Lois, with Trump and Musk in charge, we‚Äôre golden! Like when I partied with MC Hammer!""

[Peter jumps up, doing a goofy dance, arms flailing, mimicking Hammer‚Äôs moves. His over-the-top confidence and silly grin hide his denial, hyping the party to avoid facing fear.]

Cutaway gag: Peter dancing poorly with MC Hammer, yelling, ‚ÄúHammer time!‚Äù while Musk tries to sell Hammer a Cybertruck.

[Peter shuffles awkwardly, sweat dripping, as Hammer glides smoothly. Musk hovers nearby, holding a Cybertruck model, gesturing wildly to pitch it. The neon-lit club setting and Peter‚Äôs clumsy moves highlight his out-of-place energy, with Musk‚Äôs sales pitch adding absurdity.]

- At the observatory, Meg discovers a massive meteor on a direct collision course with Quahog. She tries to alert the authorities, but Trump‚Äôs administration, backed by Musk‚Äôs tech claims, dismisses it as ‚Äúfake science.‚Äù

[Meg‚Äôs eyes widen at a monitor flashing red, her hands trembling as she types. She grabs a phone, pacing frantically, her voice rising with urgency. The dismissal from a bored official (heard faintly) makes her slump, showing her isolation. Dr. Nebula pats her shoulder, grounding her.]

- Meg calls Peter, who‚Äôs wearing a Meteor MAGA hat and scrolling X for Musk‚Äôs updates.

[Meg grips the phone tightly, standing by a window showing Quahog‚Äôs chaotic streets. Her desperate expression contrasts Peter‚Äôs living room, where he lounges, hat crooked, thumbing through X, chuckling at Musk‚Äôs memes.]

Meg: ""Dad, this meteor‚Äôs gonna destroy us! Tell everyone to evacuate!""

[Meg‚Äôs voice cracks, her free hand gesturing wildly, pleading. She‚Äôs pouring her heart into saving them, her body tense with fear and determination.]

Peter: ""Meg, Trump says it‚Äôs a light show, and Elon‚Äôs got satellites. Stop ruining the vibe!""

[Peter waves her off, slouching deeper into the couch, one hand adjusting his hat. His dismissive tone and lazy posture show he‚Äôs too caught up in the hype to listen, ignoring Meg‚Äôs plea.]

Act 2: The Crisis
Setting: Observatory, buzzing with alarms; Griffin house, cluttered with party snacks; and White House, via a glitzy TV broadcast.

[**The observatory pulses with urgent beeps, monitors glowing red, while the Griffin house is a mess of snack wrappers and soda cans, the TV dominating the room. The White House broadcast is all flash, with gold accents and high-tech screens.*]

- Dr. Nebula confirms Meg‚Äôs calculations: the meteor will hit in hours. Meg begs the family to take it seriously, but they‚Äôre glued to Trump and Musk‚Äôs broadcast, where Trump calls the meteor ‚Äúa Democrat hoax‚Äù and Musk pitches a last-minute ‚ÄúHyperloop evacuation pod‚Äù that doesn‚Äôt exist.

[At the observatory, Dr. Nebula points at a grim graph, her face tight, while Meg nods, gripping a clipboard, her jaw set. At home, the Griffins gawk at the TV, Peter whooping, Lois nibbling her nails, Chris texting, and Stewie slurping juice, all tuning out Meg‚Äôs cries.]

Trump (on TV): ""These scientists? Losers. Sad. My Space Force says it‚Äôll miss us. Keep shopping, folks!""

[Trump slams the podium, leaning in, his face flushed with fervor. His bold stance and booming voice aim to squash doubts, firing up his supporters. Secret Service agents loom stiffly behind him.]

Musk (on TV): ""Also, I‚Äôm tweeting the meteor to change course. Hashtag PowerOfX. It‚Äôs science!""
[Musk types on his phone, a faint smirk flickering, swaying on his heels. His breezy tone and tech buzzwords hide his disconnect, treating the crisis like a viral stunt. A massive X logo dominates the screen.]

Stewie: ""This duo‚Äôs delusion is so synchronized, it‚Äôs like a bad buddy cop movie.""

[Stewie reclines, arms folded, one brow arched. His smug grin and sharp quip show he‚Äôs tickled yet disgusted by the chaos, savoring the absurdity while scoffing at it.]

Cutaway gag: Trump and Musk as cops, with Trump arresting a meteor and Musk trying to Neuralink it.

[Trump slaps cuffs on a cartoon meteor, strutting like a champ, while Musk wires it with electrodes, muttering about AI. The wild chase scene, with blaring sirens and a neon city, roasts their incompetence in a splashy, over-the-top style.]

- Meg and Dr. Nebula hack into a local radio station to broadcast an evacuation warning, but Musk‚Äôs Starlink network jams the signal with ads for his ‚ÄúMeteor Survival NFT.‚Äù Desperate, Meg confronts the family at home.

[Meg and Dr. Nebula hunch over a radio console, Meg twisting knobs, her face slick with sweat, laser-focused. At home, Meg slams the door open, gasping from her sprint, her eyes begging as she faces the family, who barely glance from the TV.]

Meg: ""You never listen to me! I‚Äôm trying to save you, and you‚Äôre all worshipping those idiots on TV!""

[Meg‚Äôs fists ball up, her voice soaring as she stalks toward the TV, jabbing a finger at it. Her shaking frame and raw anger spill her pain, crushed by being ignored yet again.]

Peter: ""Meg, Trump‚Äôs the President, and Musk‚Äôs, like, Tony Stark. They‚Äôve got this!""

[Peter leans in, waving a chip at Meg, eyes locked on the TV. His offhand dismissal and chip-munching show he‚Äôs too dazzled by the duo to care, shrugging off her plea.]

- Heartbroken, Meg learns of a satellite defense system that could deflect the meteor, but it‚Äôs a suicide mission due to its faulty wiring, which will fry the operator. Meg volunteers, saying to Dr. Nebula, ‚ÄúIf my family won‚Äôt care, maybe the town will.‚Äù

[Meg‚Äôs shoulders sag as she trudges out of the house, head low, steps slow toward the observatory. Inside, Dr. Nebula points to the satellite controls, and Meg nods, her face hardening with quiet determination, embracing her fate to prove her worth.]

Act 3: The Sacrifice
Setting: Observatory, now dark with flashing red alarms; Griffin house, lit by the TV‚Äôs glow.

[**The observatory is a tense, shadowy maze of sparking wires and blinking consoles, while the Griffin house feels claustrophobic, the TV‚Äôs glare casting long shadows over scattered debris.*]

- As the meteor nears, Meg works frantically to rewire the satellite system, with Dr. Nebula guiding her via radio. The Griffins, now alarmed after a meteorite crashes through their neighbor‚Äôs house, tune into Meg‚Äôs hacked radio signal.

[Meg crawls under a console, sparks flying from wires, her hands trembling as she twists them. Sweat beads on her brow, her eyes fierce despite fear. At home, the Griffins crowd around a radio, Peter gripping Lois, Chris gawking, Stewie clutching Brian‚Äôs fur, all paralyzed as the truth hits.]

Meg: over radio, tearful but firm ""I know I‚Äôm the family joke, but this is for you. Even if you hate me.""

[Meg‚Äôs voice wavers, her hands freezing briefly as she swipes at tears, then diving back into the wires. Her steady tone masks her heartbreak, her sacrifice fueled by love despite rejection. Static pops, heightening the tension.]

- Trump and Musk, broadcasting from the White House, try to spin the crisis:

[The White House set is a mess, aides muttering off-screen. Trump and Musk stand shoulder-to-shoulder, their faces looming on a massive screen, clinging to control.]

Trump: ""If there‚Äôs a meteor‚Äîand I‚Äôm not saying there is‚ÄîI‚Äôll stop it. Like Bruce Willis in Astro-Bang. Great movie!""

[Trump thrusts a finger at the camera, stalking across the podium, his voice thundering. His bravado hides rising panic, desperate to preserve his image as aides scurry nervously.]

Musk: ""I‚Äôm uploading AI to the meteor via Starlink. It‚Äôll dodge us. Or I‚Äôll build a new Quahog on the Moon!""

[Musk hammers at a laptop, his moves jerky, a wild grin flashing. He‚Äôs lost in his own hype, ignoring reality, as a glitchy Starlink graphic flickers behind him.]

- Meg activates the satellite, deflecting the meteor just in time. The observatory explodes in a surge of energy, and Meg is gone. Quahog is saved.

[Meg slams a red button, her face calm but tear-streaked, sparks swirling around her. The screen cuts to the observatory exploding in a fiery blast, debris raining down. In Quahog, the sky clears, faint cheers rising from distant streets.]

- The Griffins sit in stunned silence. Lois sobs, Peter mutters, ‚ÄúOh, man, we screwed up,‚Äù and Brian says, ‚ÄúShe was better than all of us.‚Äù Trump and Musk, on TV, take credit:

[The Griffins freeze, Lois burying her face in her hands, tears streaming, Peter staring blankly, his hat tumbling off. Chris curls up, Stewie‚Äôs jaw drops, and Brian bows his head. The TV‚Äôs blare cuts through their grief, jarring and cruel.]

Trump: ""Space Force nailed it! Meg Griffin? Nice girl, worked for us. Total Trump win!""

[Trump pumps his fists, grinning as confetti dumps too soon. His victory pose masks his cluelessness, hijacking Meg‚Äôs sacrifice to inflate his ego.]

Musk: ""My satellites helped. Posting victory memes on X right now. Follow me!""

[Musk waves his phone, scrolling X, his smirk detached. His quick typing and oblivious vibe show he‚Äôs already moved on, chasing likes over mourning.]

Epilogue: Aftermath
Setting: Griffin living room, now dim and cluttered, one week later.

[**The living room feels heavy, littered with empty snack bags and soda cans, the TV off, casting the room in a somber gloom.*]

- Quahog holds a memorial for Meg, with a statue unveiled by Mayor Adam West. Trump and Musk attend via video call, with Trump claiming he‚Äôs naming a Space Force base after Meg and Musk announcing ‚ÄúMeg Griffin Mars Colony‚Äù plans. The crowd boos.

[At the memorial, townsfolk stand quietly, a bronze Meg statue shining. West stumbles through his speech, flapping his arms awkwardly. The Griffins linger in the back, Lois wiping tears, Peter shifting uncomfortably, Chris staring at the statue. A jumbotron beams Trump and Musk‚Äôs grainy feed, their faces oversized.]

- At home, the Griffins grapple with guilt in their dysfunctional way:

[The Griffins slump on the couch, the TV dark, a heavy silence settling. Scattered snack bags and soda cans reflect their emotional disarray.]
Lois: ""I should‚Äôve told her I was proud of her.""
[Lois twists a soggy tissue, her voice trembling, eyes red and puffy. Her shaking hands and raw guilt spill out, mourning the love she never showed.]

Peter: ""Yeah, well, she was Meg. Kinda forgettable, right? pauses I‚Äôm a jerk.""

[Peter hunches, rubbing his neck, his usual swagger gone. His pause and lowered gaze reveal a rare self-awareness, stung by his role in Meg‚Äôs pain.]

Stewie: ""She‚Äôs probably in heaven, boring the clouds with her diary entries.""

[Stewie leans on Brian, twirling a pacifier, his smirk softening. His quip masks a twinge of regret, his eyes flicking away to dodge the emotion.]

- Chris finds Meg‚Äôs diary, reading an entry about wanting her family‚Äôs approval. He keeps it quietly, a subtle sign of change.

[Chris sits alone in his dim room, flipping through Meg‚Äôs diary, his fingers tracing her words. His eyes soften, and he slips it under his pillow, a quiet promise to honor her. The faint light casts a somber glow.]

Final gag: The family watches TV, where Trump hawks ‚ÄúMeg Griffin Meteor Insurance‚Äù and Musk pushes ‚ÄúMeg NFT Memorials.‚Äù The screen fades to: ‚ÄúIn Memory of Meg Griffin, Quahog‚Äôs True Hero.‚Äù

[The Griffins sink back onto the couch, the TV flickering. Peter scratches his chin, Lois sighs, and Stewie rolls his eyes as Trump and Musk‚Äôs ad drones on. The fade to Meg‚Äôs tribute lingers, the room hushed, her absence heavy.]

End Credits
- The theme plays in a slow, minor key. A post-credits scene shows Stewie tinkering with a time machine, muttering, ‚ÄúI could bring her back, but then I‚Äôd have to hear her mope again.‚Äù He shuts it off.

[Stewie hunches in his lab, surrounded by blinking gizmos, his tiny hands tweaking a glowing device. He glances at a photo of Meg, hesitates, then flicks the switch off with a shrug. The lab‚Äôs sci-fi hum fades, closing on a bittersweet note.]",1,1745978538.0,FanFictionAi,0,1.0,False

I moved into this new apartment, and my neighbor is a woman in her early 30s. I know she has a boyfriend of sorts, but one night, about six months after moving in, she texted me saying she wanted to come over because she was feeling lonely and her boyfriend wasn‚Äôt home. After a few back-and-forth chats, I said okay, come over. We slept together and had sex. I didn‚Äôt want to be the reason their relationship broke up, so the next day, I invited her for coffee to talk. She came, I kissed her, and we talked more. She said she‚Äôs planning to break up with her boyfriend, that their problems have been going on for a long time, and it‚Äôs not because of me. I felt some relief, but I still offered her ideas to make things work with him.

She‚Äôs attractive, and I like hooking up with her, but I don‚Äôt want a long-term relationship. She‚Äôs not the long-term type‚Äîshe‚Äôs kind of wild in a fun way. She kept coming over and sleeping with me a few more nights, but now I‚Äôm questioning my actions. There are two other single guys in the building, and I suspect she‚Äôs hooking up with them too.

1kb55u9,https://www.reddit.com/r/turkeyhunting/comments/1kb55u9/sunday_april_20th_2025/,"Sunday, April 20th, 2025","     A field of crystals awakened softly with the morning sun. Muffling the sweet sounds of spring‚Äôs first songbirds, the frost‚Äîformed by clear skies and cold temperatures overnight‚Äîlay atop my dormant field like a blanket. Everywhere the eye could see was covered in a glimmering sheen, clinging tightly to every stem and leaf. The sunrise, highlighting distant clouds with vibrant purples and pinks, slowly spread across our playing field. The frost glistened with a purple hue, illuminating our battlefield in our latest tango with ole Tom.

     We started up on our hill, over in the corner of our property. Operating on recent reconnaissance about our old friend, we suspected the turkeys would come off their roost and make their way through the far end of our field. As usual, the turkeys decided they didn't want to cooperate today. The silence of dawn was broken by the first series of raspy yelps emitted from my diaphragm call. Far to our west, across the neighbor‚Äôs field, came the first gobble of the morning. The unmistakable communication from our love-hungry creature came from the opposite direction of where we had expected. Still under cover of the late dawn light and the terrain between us, we quickly grabbed the lone hen decoy and moved our position closer to his, hoping to meet him halfway.

     Perched atop the smallest of ridges, just tall enough to cover our movements, stood our hen decoy. She was positioned 10 yards from the spruce line and about 20 yards from our peeping heads beneath the spruce branches. The dance between the tom and me began. With a sequence of well-timed and strategic calls, I planned to entice him away from his hen and encourage him to check out the purty thang hanging out in the field. The hen reluctantly disagreed, letting out a series of loud clucks to express her displeasure with us. We didn't mind. I argued back with her before suddenly stopping, making her feel as if she wasn't worth the fight. Mr. Tom stayed back, silent and cautious, allowing the ‚Äúladies‚Äù to sort it out and withholding his position. Tucked within the spruce trees, we had only one line of sight‚Äîand it wasn‚Äôt to him. We relied solely on his calls to help pinpoint his location.

      His prissy hen eventually moved on, and we worried that he had followed her. After some time, and with the morning coffee treating my bladder like a punching bag, duty called. I took a quick stroll away from our hiding place to a spot with better visibility and relieved myself. While I was already up, I figured a quick call to see if he was still around was worth a try. My calling was cut off mid-yelp by a loud, thunderous response‚Äîthe closest I'd heard him yet. Like a squirrel caught in the open, I scurried back to my tree and quickly sat under cover. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs not far,‚Äù I whispered to my hunting partner as I prepared for the day's dance with the turkey. With my matte-black Remington in my hands, we anxiously waited for the opportunity before us. A few more calls of lust went unreturned, and the question of where he was grew louder in my head.

       A deep bass tone rumbled in my ears, like a teen with a new subwoofer driving by from over a mile away. He was here, and he was showing off. Without our knowledge, the tom had slipped silently to within just 10 yards of us, in the opening on the opposite side of our hiding tree. K saw him immediately, whispering urgently, ‚ÄúRight there.‚Äù Surprised by his silent arrival, I carelessly clicked my safety off and swung my gun to my shoulder. There was no way he could have seen me, but the click of my safety was enough to make him cautious. Still fully strutted out, he retreated into cover as quickly as he'd appeared. The hen on the ridge was not enticing enough to make him ignore my mistake.

     For 30 minutes our ears were serenaded by the low drumming of this bird. Confidence oozing, we could hear his wingtips smacking the dry leaves as he tried his best to entice the hen back into the woods. Taking cover inside the trees, off our property, he was safe. He took the morning to slowly drift away into the woods, teasing us with sparse gobbles, bidding us farewell until next time. We were down on our luck, but there was no way I could ever consider this a bad hunt. Having the opportunity to be within 10 yards of such an intriguing animal is unlike anything else. He confirmed that we have the ability to execute, react, and call effectively‚Äîbut sometimes doing it mostly right just isn't enough.

Until next time, ole Tom.

Hello. I have seen so much info that I don't really know if it is worth spending 1500 dollars or even a little bit more or just go with a 500 USD machine.

Location: United States

I've been thinking of getting an espresso machine. It's been years now but I cannot decide.  
  
The budget ideally would be below 1500 USD. Although I could extend it to buy the Lucca La Spaziale I am not sure that would be the best idea since I have to buy a grinder as well. The grinder would probably be the DF64 or DF54 due to the price.

 would like your thoughts on machine selection based on this criteria:

  
\- I usually drink around 5 coffee drinks per day. They are usually a brew method (At the moment it has been Clever and V60) and sometimes I use a Nespresso to make a cappuccinos using the Nanofoamer from subminimal. It does the job, but I do want now make good espresso at home and real frothed milk.

\- Capable of producing excellent espresso.

\- Budget: Around 500 to 1500 USD. (It could be extend to 2300 ish, although not recommended).

\- Most of the time I am going to be drinking either flat whites or cappuccinos but I do drink espresso as well, so having a machine capable of that is key.  
¬†\- Able to froth milk for at least two consecutive beverages. Usually flat whites or cappuccinos.  
\- Expected lifespan of at least 10 years. (With proper maintenance which I will be doing).  
\- That includes PID control.  
\- That includes Temperature adjustment.  
\- Pre-infusion would be a significant bonus (If it works well).  
\- I usually drink light to medium-roasted coffee.  
\- Ideally something that works well out of the box but modification is a possibility in the long run.

  
Based on other video reviews and information from other sources I've looked into:

\- Gaggia,  
\- Rancilio Silvia  
\- Profitec Go  
\- Lelit Victoria.  
\- Lelit Elizabeth  


Given your experience, do any of you have a stronger recommendation on which of these machines to get? Is there another machine that I have not considered?  
A Gaggia to make a Gagguino would be cool but at the moment I would preffer something that works out of the box

I'm flaming HOT with anger as I shout these words into the void. The last hour of work witnessing married ""Rhonda"" spend her last 45 minutes at work being all flirty and giggly with ""Anthony"" (as everyone else in the office was just quietly working) was just starting to get too much for me. I managed to hold myself together LONG ENOUGH to keep from giving any hint of my annoyance. Even while my boss had delayed me (talking about a mistake he made with payroll), I wanted to get away as fast as I could. Thankfully, I managed to get to the grocery store where I had somewhat of breathing room to collect myself before getting back on the road again. 

\*\*SIGH\*\*

Yes, before I continue on with my white-hot rant, I will acknowledge that this is the very first time that I'm mentioning to you any kind of desire or intention to eventually marry Anthony. I will openly confess that, as my emotions are swirling so intensely, I will acknowledge the possible end game of becoming Anthony's wife. Please keep in mind, that because I'm still angry, I may not be thinking entirely too rationally or logically. I may wake up tomorrow morning and delete this whole thing, beg for forgiveness during my morning coffee, and then walk into work like nothing happened. 

\*\*SIGH\*\*

If the ability to flirt was a reflection on being a good wife, being the kind of woman that could keep a man, I would have remained married to my 2nd or 3rd ex-husband (or I'd be a widow, since my 1st ex-husband had passed away). If the ability to flirt was a true reflection of being able to keep a man, to truly understand his heart, and to meet his deepest needs in the context of an intimate relationship, I never would have been divorced. It's very hard seeing Rhonda get away with being flirty and giggly with Anthony, acting like she's just waiting around for him to ask her for her phone number and take her out, and then leaving to meet HER HUSBAND downstairs picking her up and bringing her home to their kids. I'm crying right now because I remember when I MYSELF had been a wife. I flirted with other men. I got all loud, flirty, giggly, and acted like a thirsty, sex-crazed schoolgirl with them. What did I get instead? I GOT FUCKING DIVORCED!!! Even as I'm trying my hardest here to be the right person, preparing for the slightest possibility that Anthony and I could eventually pursue something together (after all, I was the one who initially thought of him as Mr. Wrong ... !), you are instructing me to hold my fire. Meaning, I'm not supposed to initiate anything with Anthony or give him any kind of impression that I'm trying to pursue him. Meanwhile Rhonda here gets the best of both worlds: flexing her ability to seduce and attract a man (Anthony) and then coming home to another one (her husband). 

Make it make fucking sense, dear universe!

Although it's very difficult for me to think of Anthony as my (future) lawfully wedded husband, it was subconsciously brought to my attention, so I will push through and vent my unspoken thoughts to you. 

\*\*SIGH\*\*

I mentioned in one of my (unsent and handwritten love) letter to him that I mentioned that I wanted to keep him. I didn't just want to flirt with him, sleep with him, and get to know him purely for its own sake. I expressed to Anthony that I wanted to treat him in a way where I would want to keep him. I know, logically, that being able to flirt with him is not any indication of my ability to be a loyal, faithful, committed, loving and supportive wife to him. The waging battle that I'm realizing that I'm facing, universe, is the battle between The Flirt and The Wife. This brings to mind an episode of the short-lived Netflix hit *Sex/Life*, where Billie is facing divided loyalties between her ex-FWB Brad and her committed and loyal husband Cooper. She visits her former psychology instructor and shares with him her struggle. He informs her that, basically, the same guy who gives to her thrilling and amazing sex (Brad) cannot be the same guy who provides her stability and commitment (Cooper). Thinking about myself, maybe there is a difference between The Flirt (the woman who specializes in superficial conversation for the purpose of arousing within him specific desires, regardless of the intention to fulfill any of them) and The Wife (the supportive partner, who is also his best friend, who stays by his side through everything and he does the same for her). Regarding my (potential) future with Anthony, which one would I prefer: to be the one who flirts with him, or being his supportive and faithful life partner? Obviously, I cannot be both!!

If I didn't know any better universe, I would say that the reason why Anthony was perfectly content to indulge Rhonda in her flirtations with him was because he had already decided who I was going to be in comparison to her. While she was continuing on, laying down multiple thirst traps, there I was being quiet and continuing my work. She announced herself as The Flirt. So, what would that make me to him????

While I'm still going on and on with my unspoken rant, I'm going to share with you how I'm starting to see Anthony as a result of what happened today. 

I ACTUALLY WANT HIM TO SEE ME AS HIS (FUTURE) WIFE!! Okay, didn't I tell you I wasn't being rational earlier? Here I was ranting and going off, not really realizing that I'm actually getting what it is that I deeply desire to know from him. Long before he and I go out on our first date, share our first kiss, and enjoy our first night of intimacy together, I already want him to see me with intention. I want him to have already decided that he wants to pursue a committed relationship with me. I don't want to be The Flirt with him. My past has already indicated that being The Flirt doesn't mean that I get to stay as The Wife. They are totally different things!! If I'm going to decide whether to be Anthony's Flirt or Anthony's Wife, I'd rather be his wife. I want him to see me as his future partner. I want him to see me as his best friend, his supporter and encourager, the other side to his soul, his missing rib, and so much more. Apparently, the only way for him to see me that way is for The Flirt to continually announce herself. 

I'm very fortunate and very glad that the only words the other guys at work heard from me once Rhonda left were thanking my boss for coming forward about payroll and wishing everyone (else) leaving a good night. None of them had any idea as to the actual emotions I felt and where my mind actually was at the time. I cannot thank you enough, universe, for keeping me together. And thank you for being strong enough to withstand the fury of my words and providing the breathing room I need to work through things for myself. 

\*\*SIGH\*\*

I'm going to enjoy the rest of my evening. I'm sure many more lessons I need to learn will follow.

# Chapter 1: The Man Who Almost Healed

Robert Hayes never expected to feel joy again after Anna died. Some nights, he still woke reaching for her‚Äîfumbling blindly through the darkness for a hand that would never be there again. Grief, he realized, had a smell: old clothes, cold sheets, unopened mail.

Just before Anna‚Äôs passing, the twins had been born‚Äîtiny, furious fists clenching at the air. Every new day with them had felt like a second chance. Emma, with her mother's green eyes and fierce little laugh. Samuel, quieter, thoughtful even as an infant, furrowing his brow like he was trying to solve the world's problems.

They filled the house with life again. Noise. Color. Robert cooked terrible pancakes every Sunday‚ÄîEmma demanding extra syrup, Samuel meticulously sorting his blueberries before eating. He read to them every night, even when they fell asleep halfway through. They built snowmen with mittened hands in the winter, fed ducks at the pond in spring, ran barefoot through sprinklers under the sticky heat of summer.

And every night, after the giggles and the mess and the exhaustion, Robert kissed their foreheads and whispered the same thing: ""I will always protect you.""

He meant it.

That November afternoon was gray and damp, the misty rain making the world look like it was dissolving at the edges. Emma wanted a pumpkin ""big enough to sit inside,"" while Samuel had chosen one lopsided and scarred, insisting it had ""character."" Robert strapped them into their booster seats, singing along with the radio, the car filled with syrupy, sticky laughter.

The semi-truck came out of nowhere. One moment: headlights. The next: twisting metal. Then‚Äîsilence.

When Robert came to, hanging upside down from his seatbelt, the only sound was the soft hiss of the ruined engine. He screamed for them. Clawed at the wreckage. Dragged himself, bleeding and broken, toward the back. Emma and Samuel were gone. Still buckled in, so small, so still.

At the funeral, Robert stood between two tiny white caskets, staring as faces blurred around him and words tumbled into meaningless noise.

""God has a plan."" ""They're angels now."" ""Time heals.""

Time, Robert thought numbly, had already taken everything.

That night, alone in the nursery, clutching a sock no bigger than his thumb, he whispered the only prayer left to him: ""Bring them back.""

No one answered.



# Chapter 2: Hollow Men

The days after the funeral blurred together, each one a paler copy of the last. Robert woke at dawn, not because he wanted to, but because the house demanded it‚Äîcruel reminders of a life that no longer existed. Samuel‚Äôs alarm still chirped at seven a.m., a tinny little jingle that once made Samuel giggle under the covers. Robert couldn‚Äôt bring himself to turn it off. He brewed coffee he didn‚Äôt drink, packed lunches no one would eat, reached for tiny jackets that would never again be worn. Every movement ended the same way: with the silence pressing in like water in a sinking room.

He tried to hold the pieces together at first. Sat stiffly in grief counseling groups while strangers passed sorrow back and forth like trading cards. He nodded at the talk of ‚Äústages,‚Äù ‚Äúhealing,‚Äù ‚Äúcoping,‚Äù while his chest felt like it was filling with wet cement. He adopted a dog‚Äîa golden retriever named Daisy. The shelter said she was ‚Äúgood with kids.‚Äù Robert brought her home, hoping maybe something would spark again. But Daisy only whined at the door, as if she, too, was waiting for children who would never come home. Three days later, he returned her. The woman at the shelter didn‚Äôt ask why.

By spring, the house was immaculate, sterile‚Äîas if polished grief could make it livable again. The nursery remained untouched. The firetruck sat mid-rescue on the rug. A doll lay half-tucked beneath a tiny pillow, eternally ready for sleep. Sometimes Robert thought he heard them laughing upstairs, voices soft and wild and real as breath. Sometimes, he answered back.

Outside, the world moved on. Children shrieked with joy in parks. Mothers chased toddlers through grocery aisles. Fathers hoisted giggling kids onto their shoulders at county fairs. At first, Robert turned away from these scenes, flinching like they were gunshots. But soon, he began to watch. He stood in the shadows of the elementary school parking lot, leaning against his rusted truck, staring at the children spilling through the doors‚Äîbackpacks bouncing, shoes untied, voices lifted in a chorus of lives untouched by loss.

""Why them?"" he thought. ""Why not mine?""

The resentment crept in like mold beneath the wallpaper‚Äîquiet, patient, inevitable.

One evening, he sat alone in the dim light of the living room. An untouched bottle of whiskey sat on the table, sweating with condensation. The television flickered with cartoons‚Äîa plastic family around a plastic dinner table, all laughter and pastel perfection. Robert stared at the screen. Then, without warning, he hurled the remote across the room. It shattered against the wall, leaving a long, ugly crack.

His chest heaved with silent, shaking sobs. Not for Anna. Not even for Emma and Samuel. But for himself. For the man he used to be. For the father he failed to stay.

The next morning, without planning to, Robert drove to the school lot before dawn. The world was still dark, the pavement damp with night. A bright blue minivan caught his eye‚Äîplastered with ‚ÄúProud Parent‚Äù stickers and stick-figure decals of smiling children, their parents, and two dogs. Robert knelt beside it, the pocketknife flashing briefly in the dim light. He peeled the tiny stick-figure children from the back window, one by one. Then he slashed the tire, slow and steady, the blade whispering through rubber like breath.

When the mother discovered the damage hours later‚Äîcursing, frantic, dragging her children into another car‚ÄîRobert smiled for the first time in months. A small, broken thing. It didn‚Äôt fix anything. It didn‚Äôt bring Emma and Samuel back. But it shifted the weight in his chest‚Äîjust enough for him to breathe.

That night, he dreamed of them. Emma laughing, Samuel running barefoot through the grass, fireflies sparking in the gold-washed twilight. He woke to silence, the dream already fading. But something else stirred beneath the grief.

A flicker.

Control.



# Chapter 3: Seeds of Malice

The second time, it wasn‚Äôt enough to slash a tire. Robert needed them to feel it. Not just the inconvenience, not just the momentary panic. He needed them to understand that joy was a fragile, borrowed thing‚Äîone that could be ripped away just as suddenly as it was given. Like his had been.

At dusk, the school parking lot stood silent, the last child long since swept up in a waiting minivan. Robert moved through the rows of bicycles like a man walking among gravestones. Each one upright. Untouched. Proud. He slipped a box cutter from his coat pocket. The first brake cable sliced with almost no resistance. Then another. Then another. He moved methodically‚Äîhis grief becoming surgical.

The next morning, from the privacy of his truck, Robert watched a boy coast down a hill‚Äîfast, laughing, light. And then the bike didn‚Äôt stop. The child‚Äôs face turned. Laughter crumpled into terror. He crashed hard, metal meeting bone. A broken wrist. Blood in his mouth. Screams.

Parents swarmed like bees kicked from a hive, their voices panicked, their eyes wide. Robert didn‚Äôt move. He watched it all with hands trembling faintly in his lap.

He thought it would be enough.

But two weeks later, the boy returned. Cast on his arm. A gap where his front teeth had been. And he was laughing again. Like nothing had changed.

Robert‚Äôs jaw clenched until it hurt. They hadn‚Äôt learned. They had already begun to forget.

The annual Harvest Festival arrived in a blur of orange booths and plastic spiderwebs, cotton candy, and hay bales. Children raced from game to game, cheeks flushed from the cold, arms swinging bags of prizes. He moved through the maze like a ghost. No one looked twice at the man with the hood pulled low. Why would they?

Children leaned over tubs of apples, dunking their heads, emerging with triumphant smiles. Emma would have loved this. She would have squealed with laughter, water dripping from her curls, cheeks red from the chill.

His hands shook as he slipped the crushed glass into the tub. Ground fine‚Äîbut not invisible. Sharp enough. Just sharp enough. He lingered nearby, heart pounding like a drum inside his ribs.

The first scream cut through the carnival like lightning. A boy stumbled back from the tub, blood streaming from his mouth, his cry high and broken. More screams followed. Mothers pulled their children close. Booths tipped. Lights flickered. The festival collapsed into chaos.

Still‚Äînot enough.

Robert returned home and sat in the nursery. The crib was cold. The racecar bed untouched. The silence as thick as syrup. He sat on the hardwood floor, knees to his chest, and whispered:

""They don‚Äôt remember you.""

His voice cracked. Not from rage. But from emptiness.

The playground came next. The place they had loved the most.

At three in the morning, Robert crept across the dewy grass, fog clinging low, as if the world were trying to hide what he was becoming. He wore gloves. Moved like a man fixing something broken. He loosened the bolts on the swings just enough that the nuts would fall after a few good pushes. He smeared grease across the rungs of the slide. Buried broken glass beneath the innocent softness of the sandbox. Then he left.

The next day, he parked nearby, watching as the playground filled with children again. The laughter returned so easily, as if it had never left.

Then came the fall.

A boy‚Äîmaybe six‚Äîslipped from the monkey bars and struck his head on the edge of the platform. Blood pooled in the dirt. His mother‚Äôs scream sounded like something being torn in half. An ambulance arrived. The playground emptied.

Robert sat in his truck and felt that same flicker in his chest. Not joy. Not peace.

But control.

For a moment, he wasn‚Äôt the man who had clutched a tiny sock and begged God to make a trade. He was the one who turned the screws. The one who made the world bend.

He didn‚Äôt stop.



# Chapter 4: The Gentle Push

The river ran like an old scar along the edge of Halston, swollen and restless after weeks of rain. Robert stood alone at the water‚Äôs edge, the damp earth sucking at his boots, the air cold enough to bite through his coat. Across the park, families moved like faint shadows in the fog, children darting between the trees, their laughter muted and distant, like memories worn thin by time.

He watched them without blinking.

He watched him.

A small boy, maybe five or six years old, wandered away from the others, rain boots slapping through shallow puddles, his coat slipping off one shoulder. Robert saw how easily it happened‚Äîthe gap between a parent's distracted glance, the careless joy of a child unaware of how quickly the world could take everything from him.

Robert moved without thinking. Not planning. Not deciding. Just following the pull inside him, a pull shaped by loss and stitched together with rage.

He crossed the grass in slow, steady strides, boots silent against the wet earth. When he reached the boy, he didn't say a word. He simply placed a hand on the child's small back‚Äîa touch as light as breath, the kind of touch a father might give to steady his son, to guide him back to safety.

But this time, there was no safety.

The boy stumbled forward. The slick ground gave way beneath his boots. His arms flailed once, a startled gasp escaping his mouth, and then the river took him.

No thrashing. No screaming. Just the slow, cold pull of the current swallowing him whole.

Robert turned away before the first cries rang out. He walked into the trees, his breath misting in the frigid air, his hands curling into fists inside his sleeves. Behind him, screams split the fog, voices shattered the quiet‚Äîparents running, wading into the water too late.

He didn‚Äôt stop. He didn‚Äôt look back.

That night, Robert sat cross-legged between Emma‚Äôs crib and Samuel‚Äôs racecar bed. The nursery smelled of dust and faded dreams. He placed his hands in his lap, palms open like a man offering an apology no one would ever hear, and he whispered into the hollow silence:

""I made it fair.""

The words tasted like ash on his tongue.

For the first time in months, he slept through the night, deep and dreamless.

But morning brought no peace.

By noon, the riverbank had transformed into a shrine. Flowers and stuffed animals lined the muddy ground. Notes written in childish handwriting flapped in the wind. Candles guttered against the damp air. Children stood holding hands, their faces pale with confusion as their parents clutched them tighter, their grief raw and noisy.

Robert drove past slowly, his knuckles white against the steering wheel. He watched them weep, saw their shoulders shake with the weight of a loss they couldn‚Äôt contain.

For a moment, he felt something close to satisfaction. A shifting of the scales.

But as he rounded the bend and the river disappeared from view, the satisfaction dissolved, leaving behind a familiar emptiness.

They would mourn today. Tomorrow, they would forget.

They always forget.



# Chapter 5: The Town Crumbles

Three days later, the boy‚Äôs body was pulled from the river, tangled in roots and mud, bloated from the cold. The coroner called it an accident. Drowning. A tragic slip. Everyone in Halston nodded and murmured and avoided each other‚Äôs eyes. But something changed.

The parks emptied. Sidewalks once buzzing with bikes and hopscotch now lay silent under cloudy skies. Parents walked their children to school in tight clumps, hands gripped a little too tightly, eyes flicking to every passing car. Playgrounds stood deserted beneath creaking swings and rusting chains. But it didn‚Äôt last.

A week passed. Then another. The fences around the park came down. Children returned‚Äîcautious at first, then louder, bolder. The shrieks of joy returned, diluted with only a trace of caution. The town, like it always did, began to forget.

Robert couldn‚Äôt stand it.

He returned to the scene of the first fall‚ÄîMiller Park‚Äîunder the cover of fog and early morning darkness. The playground had been repaired. New bolts gleamed beneath the swing seats. New paint shone on the monkey bars.

Robert smiled bitterly. Then he went to work.

He loosened the bolts again, not so much that they would fall immediately, but just enough to ensure failure. Enough to remind. Enough to reopen the wound.

That morning, a boy ran ahead of his mother, eager to swing higher, faster. Robert watched from his truck as the seat tore loose in mid-air, the boy thrown to the gravel below like a puppet with its strings cut. Another scream. Another ambulance. Another tiny victory. But it wasn‚Äôt enough.

One broken arm would never equal two coffins.

Thanksgiving loomed, brittle and joyless. Halston strung up lights, tried to bake its way back into comfort, but everything tasted like fear. Robert didn‚Äôt feel it soften. If anything, the ache in his chest had sharpened.

He found his next moment during a birthday party‚Äîballoons tied to fence posts, paper hats, children screaming with sugared laughter. Seven years old. The age Emma and Samuel would have been.

He watched from the alley behind the house, his jacket dusted with soot to match the disguise‚Äîjust another utility worker. He didn‚Äôt need threats or blackmail this time. He didn‚Äôt need help.

Just a soft smile. A kind voice. A simple story about a missing puppy.

The little girl followed him willingly.

In the plastic playhouse near the edge of the yard, Robert tucked her gently beneath unopened presents. Her arms were folded neatly. Her hair smoothed back. He set Emma‚Äôs old music box beside her, its tune warped and gasping. It played three broken notes before clicking into silence.

She looked like she was sleeping.

By the time the party noticed she was missing, Robert was already miles away. He drove in silence, humming the lullaby softly under his breath, as if to soothe himself more than her.

But the hollow inside him didn‚Äôt shrink.

Winter came early that year. Snow blanketed the sidewalks. The playgrounds stayed empty now‚Äînot because of caution, but because of cold. Christmas lights blinked behind drawn curtains. People whispered more often than they spoke.

And still, the town tried to move forward.

Robert watched two boys skipping stones into the water where the river hadn‚Äôt yet frozen. They were brothers. They laughed without fear. Without consequence.

Samuel should have had a brother to skip stones with.

Robert crouched beside them. Smiled. Held out a daisy chain he had woven in the truck‚Äîwhite flowers strung together with trembling hands. The boys giggled and reached for it.

He guided them closer to the edge.

One soft push.

The river accepted them.

When their bodies were found seventeen days later, wrapped in each other‚Äôs arms beneath a frozen bend, the daisy chain had vanished. But Robert still saw it‚Äîlooped around their wrists like a crown of thorns.

Elsewhere in town, Linda Moore sat in front of her computer. Her spreadsheet blinked. A child‚Äôs name‚ÄîEli Meyers‚Äîsuddenly shifted rows. Not one she had touched. Not one she had assigned.

Beside the name, a new comment appeared: ‚ÄúHe looks like Samuel did when he lost his first tooth.‚Äù

Then a new tab opened‚Äîher niece‚Äôs photo, taken from outside the school that morning. Through a window. Across glass.

The screen blinked red: ‚ÄúShe still likes hide-and-seek, right?‚Äù

Linda‚Äôs hands hovered over the keys. She didn‚Äôt call anyone. She didn‚Äôt say anything. She just let the change stand.

That afternoon, Eli boarded the wrong van for a field trip. When the chaperones reached the botanical gardens, they came up one short. They retraced every step, called his name until their voices cracked. But Eli was gone.

The police found his backpack three days later, tucked under a hedge near the perimeter fence. Zipper closed. Lunch untouched. No struggle. No footprints. No sign of him at all.

Just silence.

The school shut down its field trip program. Metal detectors were installed the next week‚Äîsecondhand machines that buzzed even when touched gently. Classroom doors were fitted with new locks. Parent volunteers were fingerprinted. A dusk curfew followed.

In a closed-door meeting, someone on the city council finally said it out loud:

‚ÄúSabotage.‚Äù

Maria Vance stood outside Halston Elementary the next morning. The sky was gray, the cold sharp enough to sting. Parents didn‚Äôt make eye contact. Teachers moved like ghosts. Children whispered like everything was a secret.

Maria didn‚Äôt need the pins on her map anymore. She could feel the pattern in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt chaos.

This was design.

And whoever was behind it‚Ä¶ they were just getting started.

  


# Chapter 6: Graves and Whispers

Another funeral. Another headline. Another casket lowered into the frozen ground while a town full of trembling hands tried to convince themselves that prayer could hold back death. Halston draped itself in mourning again, but the grief rang hollow. They weren‚Äôt mourning Robert‚Äôs children. They were mourning their own safety, their own illusions.

Still, life in Halston ground on. The grocery stores stayed open. The school bell still rang. The church choir resumed, voices cracking on and off-key. Robert watched it all from the outside, a man staring through glass at a world he no longer belonged to. Their fear wasn‚Äôt enough. Their tears weren't enough. They had forgotten Emma and Samuel.

So he decided to make them remember.

He found the perfect place: a crumbling church tucked into a forgotten bend of road, its steeple sagging like a broken finger pointed skyward. Once a place of baptisms and vows, now it stank of mildew and mouse droppings. Still, there was something fitting about it. Robert prepared carefully. He built a crude cross out of rotting pew backs. He scavenged candles from a thrift store bin. He smuggled in a battered cassette deck, loaded with a single song‚Äî""Safe in His Arms,"" warped and warbling with age.

He thought about Emma humming along to hymns in the backseat, Samuel tapping his feet without knowing the words. He thought about the empty nursery and the promises he had failed to keep.

The boy he chose wasn‚Äôt special. Just small. Just alone. Harold Knox, the school bus driver, had been warned months before. A photo of his daughter tucked inside his glovebox. A note in red marker: ""He will suffer. Or she will."" Nails delivered in a plain manila envelope.

On a cold Thursday morning, the bus paused at Pine Creek stop. Fog licked the ground like low smoke. One child stepped off. The doors hissed shut behind him. Robert was waiting in the trees.

The boy didn‚Äôt scream. He didn‚Äôt run. He simply blinked up at the man reaching out to him. Inside the ruined church, Robert worked quickly but carefully. The child was lifted onto the wooden cross, his back pressed to the splintering wood. Nails were driven through soft palms and tender feet. Not savagely‚Äîbut deliberately, with grim reverence. Each strike of the hammer echoed through the empty rafters like the tolling of a slow funeral bell.

""You'll see them soon,"" Robert whispered as he drove the final nail home. ""My little ones are waiting.""

He placed a paper crown on the boy‚Äôs brow. Smeared a rough ash cross over the child's small chest. Lit six candles at the base of the altar. Then he pressed play. The hymn trickled through the cold, rotten air, warbling and distant. Robert stood for a long moment, his eyes stinging, before he turned and walked away. He locked the doors behind him, leaving the boy crucified beneath the broken arches.

It was the boy‚Äôs mother who found him. She had followed the music, though no one else had heard it. She had forced the heavy doors open and fallen to her knees at the sight. The boy was alive. Barely. But something essential in him‚Äîsomething fragile and bright‚Äîhad been extinguished forever.

Halston did not rally around this tragedy. There were no vigils. No bake sales. No Facebook groups offering casseroles and prayers. They shut their church doors. Canceled choir practice. Turned their faces away from their own shame.

Maria Vance stood outside the ruined church, the rain soaking through her coat, her hair plastered to her forehead. She didn‚Äôt light a cigarette. Didn‚Äôt open her notepad. She just stared through the doorway at the altar, at the boy nailed to the cross, at the candles sputtering against the wet wind.

This wasn‚Äôt revenge anymore. It wasn‚Äôt even grief. This was ritual.

That night, Maria tore everything off the walls of her office. Maps, photographs, reports‚Äîall of it came down. She started over with red string and thumbtacks, tracing each death, each disappearance, each shattered life. And when she stepped back, she saw it for what it was: a spiral.

Not random chaos. Not accidents. A wound closing in on itself.

At its center: silence. No fingerprints. No footprints. No smoking gun. Just grief. And grief was spreading like infection.

Parents pulled their children out of school. The Christmas pageant was canceled. The playgrounds sat under gathering drifts of snow, swings frozen mid-sway. Stores boarded their windows after dark. Halston was curling inward, shrinking, dying a little more each day.

And somewhere, Maria knew, the hand behind all of it was still moving.

She didn‚Äôt have proof. Not yet. But she could feel it in her bones.

This wasn‚Äôt over. Not even close.

Late that night, staring at her empty wall, Maria whispered to the darkness: ""I‚Äôm coming for you.""

And somewhere out in the dead heart of Halston, something whispered back.

  


# Chapter 7: The Spider‚Äôs Web

The sketchbook was found by accident, jammed between a stack of overdue returns at the Halston Public Library. A volunteer almost tossed it into the donation bin without looking. Curiosity saved it‚Äîand maybe saved lives.

At first glance, it looked like any child's notebook. Tattered corners. Smudges of dirt. But inside, Maria Vance saw what others might have missed. She flipped through the pages with gloved hands, her stomach tightening with every turn.

Children, sketched in trembling pencil lines, filled the pages. Their faces twisted in terror. Scenes of drowning, of falling, of burning playgrounds and broken swings. Some pages had dates scrawled in the margins‚Äîevents that had already happened. Others bore dates that hadn‚Äôt yet arrived.

Mixed among the drawings were music notes, faint staves from hymns, each line annotated with uneven, obsessive care. On one page, three candles formed a triangle, familiar from the church scene. On another, a child's chest bore the ash cross Robert had smeared. It was all there‚Äîmapped in quiet, meticulous horror.

One line, scrawled over and over in the margins, stopped Maria cold: ""I don‚Äôt want them to suffer. I want them to remember. To feel it. To see them. Emma liked daisies. Samuel hated swings. They laughed on rainy days. Please. Remember.""

She pressed her hand to her mouth, her eyes stinging. This wasn‚Äôt just violence. This was love‚Äîtwisted, broken love, weaponized into something unrecognizable.

At the bottom of many pages, a code repeated again and again: 19.73.14.8.21

It wasn‚Äôt a phone number. It wasn‚Äôt coordinates. It wasn‚Äôt a date. Maria stayed up all night breaking it down. Old habits from cold cases surfaced‚Äîsimple alphanumeric cipher: A=1, B=2, and so on.

S.M.H.H.U.

Nonsense, until she cross-referenced abandoned businesses in Halston's property records.

Samuel‚Äôs Mobile Home Hardware Utility. A tiny repair shop that had shuttered years ago, its letters still ghosting across a sagging storefront.

The lease belonged to a man who had never made the papers until now: Robert Hayes.

No criminal record. No complaints. No outstanding bills. His name surfaced once, buried in an old laptop repair registration. The name Anna Hayes appeared alongside his. Deceased. Along with two children: Emma and Samuel. A car crash, two years prior.

Maria‚Äôs pulse pounded in her ears. She pulled the warrant herself. No backup. No news vans. Just her badge and a city-issued key.

The house at the end of Chestnut Lane looked abandoned. The windows were boarded. Weeds clawed their way up the front steps. But inside, the air smelled like grief had been embalmed into the walls.

She moved slowly, her footsteps muffled against the dust. The kitchen was stripped bare. The living room was hollowed out, the couch gone, the tables missing. Only the nursery remained untouched.

Two beds‚Äîone tiny racecar frame, one white-painted crib. Tiny shoes lined up neatly against the wall. Crayon drawings taped with careful hands: Emma holding a daisy. Samuel clutching a paper star.

Maria‚Äôs throat tightened. She knelt by the crib and saw it‚Äî A loose floorboard, cut precisely.

Underneath, she found a panel. And beneath the panel: photographs.

Hundreds of them.

Children on swings. Children walking home from school. A girl climbing the jungle gym. A boy waiting at a crosswalk. Her own niece, captured through the glass of a cafeteria window. Even herself‚Äîphotographed at her office window, late at night, unaware.

On the back of her photo, in red marker, someone had scrawled: ""Even the strong lose their children.""

Maria staggered back, the room tilting. Robert hadn‚Äôt been lashing out blindly. He had been orchestrating this, piece by piece, grief by grief.

He had built a web.

And now she was standing at its center.

  


# Chapter 8: The Broken Father

They found him at an abandoned grain silo just outside Halston, a skeleton of rust and rotted beams forgotten by progress. The frost clung to the metal, and the morning mist wrapped around the place like a shroud.

Inside, twenty children sat in a wide circle, drowsy, confused, but alive. Their hands were zip-tied loosely in front of them‚Äîno bruises, no screaming. Only a heavy, drugged stillness. The air smelled of damp hay, gasoline, and old metal. Makeshift wiring coiled around the support beams, tangled like veins. Propane tanks sat beneath them, linked by a taut, quivering wire.

At the center stood Robert Hayes.

He was barefoot, his clothes coated in dust and ash, his hair hanging in ragged tufts over his eyes. In one hand, he clutched a worn photograph‚ÄîEmma dressed in an orange pumpkin costume, Samuel wearing a ghost sheet too big for him, chocolate smeared across his chin. The picture was bent, the edges soft from being touched too often.

In his other hand: the detonator.

Maria Vance pushed past the barricades before anyone could stop her. She left her gun holstered. She left the shouting negotiators behind. She moved through the broken doorway into the silo‚Äôs yawning cold, stepping carefully as if entering a church.

Robert didn‚Äôt look at her at first. His thumb brushed across Samuel‚Äôs face in the photo, tender and trembling. When he finally raised his eyes, they were dark hollows rimmed with exhaustion‚Äînot anger. Not even madness.

Just grief.

""They laugh,"" Robert whispered, his voice rough, shredded from disuse. ""They still dance. They pretend it didn‚Äôt happen.""

Maria stopped a few feet away, close enough to see the scars time had carved into him, the way his shoulders sagged under invisible weights.

""They didn‚Äôt forget your children,"" she said softly. ""They forgot how to show it.""

Robert‚Äôs lip trembled. His grip on the photograph tightened.

""Emma loved the rain,"" he said, as if to himself. ""Samuel... he hummed when he drew. No one remembers that.""

""I do,"" Maria said.

The words cracked something inside him. His arms slackened. His body seemed to shrink. He looked down at the children‚Äîtheir heads drooping in the cold‚Äîand then, finally, he let the switch fall. It hit the dirt with a soft, hollow thud.

Robert Hayes sank to his knees, folding into himself like a man kneeling at an altar. The officers moved in then‚Äîslowly, carefully. No shouting. No violence. They cuffed him gently, almost reverently, as if recognizing they were not capturing a monster, but burying a broken father.

As they led him past Maria, he turned his head slightly. His voice, when it came, was low enough that only she could hear.

""I killed most of them,"" he said.

Not all. Most.

The word cut deeper than any weapon.

Robert hadn‚Äôt acted alone.

And Halston‚Äôs nightmare was far from over.

  


# Chapter 9: Broken Threads

Two weeks after Robert Hayes was locked behind steel bars, another child died.

A girl this time. Found floating face down in a retention pond behind Halston Middle School. Her sneakers were placed neatly beside her backpack, the zipper closed, her lunch still inside untouched. There were no signs of a struggle. No bruises. No cries for help. Just the stillness of the water swallowing another small life.

Maria Vance stood in the rain at the pond‚Äôs edge, her hands balled into fists in her coat pockets. She watched as divers hauled the girl‚Äôs body out under a gray, broken sky. Every instinct in her screamed against the easy explanation being whispered around her: accident. Tragedy. Bad luck.

But Maria knew better.

Robert Hayes was sealed away, his world reduced to a cell barely wide enough to stretch his arms. No visitors. No phone calls. No letters. And still‚Äîthe dying continued.

Someone else was carrying the flame now.

She returned to her office late that night and faced the wall of photographs and maps. Not as a detective. Not even as a protector. As a mourner. Someone who had lost, and who understood the ache that demanded action, no matter the cost.

This wasn‚Äôt about Robert anymore. It was about everyone he had touched.

She didn‚Äôt trace the victims this time. She traced the helpers.

The janitor who had locked the wrong fire exit during the Christmas pageant. The administrator who had quietly reassigned field trip groups. The bus driver who had closed the doors before the last child could climb aboard.

Ordinary people. Invisible hands.

Maria started digging.

Brian Teller cracked first. She approached him without backup, without even her badge displayed. Just a quiet conversation at his kitchen table. She asked about the fire door. His fingers trembled around his coffee cup. She asked about the night of the pageant. He looked away.

Then she mentioned his son. The boy with asthma.

Brian broke like a rotted beam.

""They sent me a photo,"" he whispered. ""It showed a red circle around his chest... around his lungs.""

He thought it was a prank at first. A cruel joke. He hadn‚Äôt meant for anyone to get hurt. But Robert had known exactly where to cut.

Linda Moore came next. She was waiting in the empty school office when Maria arrived, staring blankly at the playground beyond the frosted windows.

""I didn‚Äôt want anyone to die,"" Linda said before Maria could even speak. ""They sent me a picture of my niece. Sleeping. In her bed. I just... I thought if I moved a name, it would be harmless.""

Harold Knox‚Äîthe bus driver‚Äîtook the longest. He didn‚Äôt speak at all when Maria placed the envelope on the table between them. The photos. The nails. The hymn sheet with the red slash across it.

His hands shook. His shoulders sagged.

""I thought it would end,"" he said finally. ""I thought if I did what they asked, it would be over.""

Maria said nothing. She didn‚Äôt need to. Because she understood something that terrified her.

Robert Hayes hadn‚Äôt needed to kill with his own hands.

He had taught grief how to move from person to person, like a contagion. He had taught fear how to whisper in the ears of desperate mothers, exhausted fathers, terrified guardians. He had taught ordinary people to become monsters in the name of love.

That night, Maria rebuilt her board one last time.

Not a network of victims. But of mourners. Of conspirators. Of grief-stricken souls trapped between guilt and survival.

She traced red string from each accomplice, not to Robert, but to the acts they committed‚Äîsmall acts, each just a hair‚Äôs breadth from excusable, from forgivable, until they weren‚Äôt.

At the center of the new web wasn‚Äôt a man anymore. It was a wound.

Robert Hayes had planted something that would not die with him. It had learned to spread.

It had learned to live.

And it was still growing.



# Chapter 10: Ashes in the Wind

Robert Hayes was gone‚Äîa hollow man locked away behind glass and concrete, his name recorded in a courthouse ledger no one cared to read twice. His trial was short, his sentencing swift. Life without parole. No outbursts. No apologies.

And yet, Halston didn‚Äôt recover.

The news cameras packed up and left. The vigil candles guttered and drowned in rain. The teddy bears and faded flowers piled at playground fences decayed beneath early snows. A few hollow speeches were made about resilience, about healing, about moving forward.

But fear had taken root deeper than grief ever could.

Children walked to school two by two, their hands clenched white-knuckled. Parents trailed behind them, glancing over their shoulders at every rustle of leaves, every parked car. Churches stayed half-empty, pews gathering dust. Christmas decorations blinked dimly behind barred windows. Laughter, when it came, sounded thin and brittle.

Maria Vance saw it everywhere. In the way playgrounds sat deserted even on sunny days. In the way neighbors no longer trusted each other with their children. In the way hope had been packed away with the last of the holiday lights, perhaps forever.

And still, the messages came.

No more crude threats. No more photographs. Just notes now‚Äîtyped, anonymous, slipped under doors or taped to mailbox flags. Simple messages.

""We‚Äôre still here."" ""She still dreams of water, doesn‚Äôt she?"" ""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria sat alone most evenings at Miller Park, sipping cold coffee as the swings moved listlessly in the wind. She watched a rusted carousel creak in slow, aching turns. She watched the ghost of what Halston used to be.

And she understood, bitterly, that Robert Hayes had won something no prison walls could take away. He had planted fear not in the hearts of individuals, but in the soil of the town itself. It bloomed every day, fed by memory and absence.

He had turned grief into a weapon. And he had taught others how to wield it.

Halston wore its fear like an old, threadbare coat now‚Äîsomething familiar and heavy and impossible to shed.

Maria kept working. She kept pulling at threads, reopening old files, retracing old paths. She chased shadows. She chased half-remembered names. She chased whispers of whispers, knowing most of it would never lead anywhere clean.

Because Robert hadn‚Äôt needed to give orders anymore.

He had shown them how.

How to wound without touching. How to kill without a sound. How to turn love itself into a noose.

Maria walked the town at night sometimes, past shuttered shops, past homes with blacked-out windows, past a burned tool shed someone had once set ablaze just because it ‚Äúlooked wrong.‚Äù Every porch light flickering behind a curtain. Every father standing a little too long at the window after putting his children to bed. Every mother who locked every door twice, even during the day.

This was the new Halston.

Not a place. A wound.

The final note came on a Tuesday morning. No envelope. Just a sheet of paper taped to Maria‚Äôs front door, the words typed carefully, the ink barely dry.

""You can‚Äôt save them all.""

Maria stood barefoot on the porch, the snow biting up through her skin, and stared at the note until the cold seeped into her bones. Then she struck a match, holding it to the paper until it curled black and drifted apart into the wind.

Ashes in the snow.

She watched the last of it vanish into the pale morning light.

And whispered to the empty, listening town:

""Maybe not. But I can damn well try.""

We can geek out about ITIL all day, but honestly, the real magic happens when we actually get what the business we support is all about.

Think of it this way: knowing what makes the company tick is like having cheat codes for ITSM. Why?

 * Picking the Right Battles: When stuff hits the fan, knowing what's actually making the company money (or losing it!) helps us figure out what to fix first. A glitch on the main sales platform? ALL HANDS ON DECK. Someone's printer acting weird? We'll get to it, but maybe after the fire's out.
 * Building Stuff That Actually Helps: Instead of just building cool tech, understanding the business lets us create services that actually help them do their thing better. Makes sense, right?
 * Talking Like a Real Person: When we can chat with the business folks using their own lingo and understand their goals, suddenly we're not just ""the IT department"" ‚Äì we're partners.
 * Getting Respect (Finally!): When the business sees we get them, they trust us more and are way more on board with our ITSM plans. Win-win!
Real Talk: Go grab a coffee with someone from sales, marketing, or whatever part of the business you support. Ask them what their biggest headaches are. You might be surprised how much it helps you do your job better.

How do you get to know the business side? Spill the beans!

Not even 5 minutes later, my heart started racing to around 150bpm. It stayed like this for 12 hours, and after this I had difficulty breathing.

Fast forward months later, I'm still experiencing:

* Constant yawning (can't get enough air even when yawning)
* Persistent difficulty breathing that only stops when I sleep and reappears randomly after waking up
* Severe and CONSTANT dry mouth on awakening that has not gone away for a single day since the incident
* Occasional dizziness and light-headedness (feels like I'm going to faint)
* Initially had lack of appetite that resolved after a few weeks
* One random episode of feeling really cold

I had a 2-week period where symptoms disappeared completely, which occurred about 3 weeks after they began. Then I suddenly started getting a bad coughing fit 2 hours after waking up, and all symptoms returned.

My digestive system has also been affected, I've had alternating constipation and diarrhea, and recently noticed black specks (possibly seeds) in my stool.

I've been told this is probably anxiety, but I find it hard to believe since it's constant, every single day, and never happened before the alcohol incident. The only similar experience I've had is sometimes getting shortness of breath for a few hours after drinking coffee. My stress tolerance has drastically decreased, if I get even slightly scared, I feel like I'm going to faint.

Tests completed (all normal):

* Echocardiogram
* Electrocardiogram
* Blood analysis
* Evaluation by a cardiologist who said symptoms are ""subjective""

Interestingly, two things have helped somewhat:

1. Probiotics seemed to improve my symptoms
2. A herbal supplement containing passion flower, valerian, lemon balm, California poppy, and melatonin also reduced symptoms

Hours after my symptoms began, EMS gave me some medicine, but none of it had a significant effect. The medicine was:

* 10mg Diazepam
* Verapamil
* 10mg Lisinopril

I've been looking into acetaldehyde sensitivity and the connection between alcohol, mucosal barrier damage, and chronic symptoms. Could this be a case where the alcohol triggered acetaldehyde buildup that damaged my mucosal barriers, leading to systemic effects including breathing issues and dry mouth?

I tried to start exercising to deal with the symptoms but could barely manage 2 minutes of HIIT on the first day. I also wake up with dry mouth every single morning.

Has anyone experienced anything similar or have any insights into this connection between alcohol, acetaldehyde, and persistent symptoms? What specialists should I see beyond cardiology?

Just looking to gauge if there would be much interest in a DVD rental store somewhere in central-ish Auckland? I miss going to the local rental store, chatting films with the workers and just the physical process of walking there, browsing etc.

My idea would be to have a cosy space and start with a few hundred titles, and grow from there. As a point of difference, I would want to stock quality titles that are hard or impossible to find on streaming services. Also keen to have a lot of foreign films, cult classics and even new releases.

I'm sick of endlessly scrolling through Netflix's library desperately looking for something of value. We are also constantly subscribing to other services for a month or 2 and then cancelling due to cost. It's so depressing just letting these giant companies suck money out of your account every week/month for such an impersonal experience. I also feel like with all the tech advancements, AI, online shopping etc, we are losing any sense of community that we once had. It seems as though we are creating a society where no one needs to leave their house. Which just isn't healthy.

My ideal store would have some comfy furniture for customers to chill on while browsing. I'm no barista but I'd love to serve coffee, stock some indulgent and healthier treats and drinks for the ultimate movie night. The vision would be to create a space where film-lovers can come to hang out, talk about films, art, music, whatever, and bring back that lost magic of renting films on a physical medium. 

In terms of payment, I would offer different subscription tiers allowing you different quantities of rentals per month. I would also have an option of just paying per title. I'd also rent out, and potentially sell, region-free Blu-ray / DVD players.

I live in Three Kings but I imagine the ideal location would be more central. Which creates my main barrier to realising this dream: property rent / lease costs.

Anyhow, let me know your thoughts. Would you be keen? Or does the idea not stand a chance in today's world of streaming? What would the ideal location be? Would you want to see old Playstation games available for rent too? And the consoles themselves?

We've been through a lot of ups and downs pero nalalampasan naman namin. Dumating and sunud-sunod na bagyo sa buhay-magkapares namin hanggang sa nagdecide akong tama na. Dahil maliit pa ang bata, hindi niya nagets. Naging maayos din siguro ang co-parenting namin kaya hindi nahalata ng bata na magkahiwalay na kami ng tatay niya. A year or so after nagkaroon ako ng boyfriend (J). Sobrang maalaga, maaasahan. Na-realize kong oo, kaya kong gawin lahat ng gawaing bahay, pero hindi ko kailangang gawin lahat. Kasi nandiyan siya para tumulong, para gawin lahat. Madaling lumalim ang feelings ko for him. He brought my feminine side out. 

Dumating 'yong time na nagkaisip na 'yong anak namin ni R. Nagets niya na hindi na ako babalik sa tatay niya, na may ""other relationship"" na ako, pagkakasabi pa niya. Umiyak siya, ayaw niya akong yakapin. From being his ""biggest love"", to ayaw na akong tignan at tabihan man lang. Sabi niya gusto niya ako ulit at tatay niya. Si R, as months and years passed by, pinakitang nagbago naman na. Gusto niyang makipagbalikan, kagaya rin ng gusto ng anak namin. 

Ako naman, hindi ko yata maaatim na buong buhay namin ay may galit at sama ng loob sa akin ang anak ko. Hindi ko maimagine gaano kalaking pagsisisi ang mararamdaman ko kapag lumaki siyang may depresyon o may dinadala dahil sa pagkakaroon ng broken family.

Ang ginawa ko, nakipaghiwalay ako kay J. Minsan kapag tinitignan ko si R nang hindi siya nakatingin, kinakapa ko kung may damdamin pa ako para sa kanya. Wala akong maramdaman. Wala na talaga. Napunta ako noon sa ""silent quitting"" noong kami pa. Na-fall out of love akong talaga pala. Nasawa rin ako sa kahihintay sa kasal na sinasabi niya lang kapag may tampuhan at bumabawi siya. Pero on a normal day, ayaw niya raw sa kasal. (But during the breakup sinabi niyang nagsisisi siyang hindi niya pa ako pinakasalan, but will surely do it bumalik lang ako sa kanya.)

Sinabi ko kay J na sobrang sakit nitong desisyon na ito. Kasi hindi ko siya iiwan dahil hindi ko na siya mahal, kundi mas mahal ko ang anak ko, at ang kaligayahan niya, kaysa sa sarili kong kaligayahan. Wala pang anak si J pero nagets niya. Nagets nya yung rurok ng pagmamahal ng magulang, na uunahin ang anak kaysa sa sarili. Matagal kaming nag-iyakan habang nag-uusap. Napakasakit. I know myself. I have this nature of letting feelings linger for so long. Galit, tampo, saya, inis, lumbay. I can imagine myself longing for him infinity. O OA lang ako? Is there such a thing na ""hindi na nakausad""? Or eventually, we all get to move forward? Parang agos sa ilog, eventually tatangayin ka kahit gaano ka pa kabigat na bato.

At bumalik na nga ako kay R at sa anak ko. Mahirap magpanggap na okay ako, pero kinakaya ko. Nakakaya ko kapag nakikita kong masaya na ang anak namin. Ako na ulit ang ""biggest love"" niya. 'Yung feelings ko kay R, sinusubukan ko namang ibalik. Pero sa ngayon mahirap pa. Kahit pilitin. Todo effort siyang bumawi pero alam kong alam niyang sa ngayon, wala pang nanunumbalik sa akin. At lahat ng nangyayari ay para lang sa anak namin.

Minsan kapag maganda ang panahon, nagbabike ako sa mga lugar na dati namin pinupuntahan ni J. Sa hanging bridge, sa tabing-ilog, sa dagat, sa rice fields, sa coffee shops. Hindi ako hoping na makita siya. Nag-iisip lang ako. (Mars in 12th house ako, hi Astrology peeps! Isolation talaga ang best medicine ko in all kinds of life challenges) Tinitignan ko 'yung kamay kong bakante na, na dating hawak niya. Gusto ko ulit maramdamang hawak niya. Pero hindi na pwede. How do I get through the days? Minsan gusto ko na lang bumalik sa 9-year-old me na kumakain ng champorado for breakfast, getting ready for my 8AM class. Spongebob, Noddy, Powerpuff Girls... Hayyys.

Kay J, 'yung pinag-usapan natin ha. Sana balang araw, kapag pwede na.",0,1745976508.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False

He knew how this test would end, just as the last twelve tests in the past thirty years had gone.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll let you know when my team has completed the necessary calculations to prevent the drive and its payload from reemerging in Saturn‚Äôs core.‚Äù George said, unbothered by the lack of faith Antony had in their work.

George had spent decades on the AMP Jump project before Antony was recruited to help with power and shielding issues. He had seen and overcome every problem this project could throw at him‚Äîuntil the huge, seemingly insurmountable mountain they were trying to leap over came into view.

A.M.P. Jump stood for Anti-Matter Propelled Jump‚Äîin other words, real-life, honest-to-God faster-than-light travel. Not the most surprising development to the Empire after figuring out immortality and faster-than-light communications, but still a big deal. Or at least it was, until the project got bogged down by the unfortunate side effects of jumping.

‚ÄúOkay, we are ready. Release containment of antiproton and proton plasmas at will.‚Äù He told Antony from the other side of Jupiter‚Äôs orbit.

George and his clones believed that, while difficult and time-consuming, the problem of transporting mass faster than the speed of causation would be simple. Like ants trying to figure out how to move a ten-gram weight up a flight of stairs‚Äîslowly and painfully.

They believed this because, a few decades earlier, the tyranny of light speed had been conclusively circumvented with the discovery of FTL comms. This miracle of science and engineering was made possible by using exotic entangled particles that seemed to rip through the universe and pop up somewhere else, in very specific conditions that could be replicated and standardized. This opened up the Sol system to more efficient, cheap, bandwidth-limited communications‚Äîonce the hardware was set up.

After years of internal development, George and his clones had developed an energy-hungry method of sending electrons‚Äîa particle with mass‚Äîfrom one place to another faster than a photon could make the same trip. While impressive and widely publicized in the Empire, they needed to scale up to use the technology for expansion to other stellar systems within a reasonable timeframe.

Originally, the issue of scale was thought to be just that: scale. More room for protons, atoms, and multicellular organisms. More instantaneous release and use of massive energy. That‚Äôs when the real barrier to FTL came into view: many compact and useful forms of information storage were completely scrambled in the translation back into normal spacetime. Magnetic, capacitive, and‚Äîmost horrifyingly‚Äîeven protein folds and DNA strands were all scrambled beyond readability.

‚ÄúMagnetic bottle shut off in three, two, one.‚Äù Antony counted after pressing the big red central button.

There was a soft thump in both pressurized cabins on opposite sides of Jupiter, barely audible to the human ear. A tiny, localized ripple in spacetime‚Äîone of the many reasons to conduct tests out near Jupiter, where the gravity well could stabilize things and no important property could be damaged.

‚ÄúSensors orbiting Saturn picked up post-jump signatures. They have a visual. Jump successful.‚Äù George said, hoping Antony‚Äôs shields held up and preserved something useful.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see the damage.‚Äù Antony sighed as he sent in pre-programmed drones from Saturn‚Äôs orbit to inspect test materials and his jury-rigged fuse charge delta detector. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gonna take a while for the drones to get to the ship and inspect the samples. Let‚Äôs meet up at the station orbiting Europa. There‚Äôs a diner I like that should be open by the time we both get there.‚Äù

‚ÄúSounds good,‚Äù George agreed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs gotta work with this new shield configuration. I can just feel it. This time, five years from now, we‚Äôll beat the colony ship on its way to Proxima Centauri.‚Äù

Antony settled back in his chair as the drones sped toward the ship. There was nothing more to do but wait.

Several hours and one cramped shuttle ride later, he stepped through the wide glass doors of the Europa Station Diner.

He scoffed. Only an architect could think glass doors made sense on a space station. Just because we have backups now doesn‚Äôt mean I welcome the idea of sucking on vacuum.

The diner clung to the edge of the station‚Äôs lower ring, all chrome fixtures and low spin gravity-adjusted booths. Bright signs in English and Latin flickered overhead.

Antony spotted George already seated in the back, nursing a steaming mug of synth-coffee.

We still can‚Äôt seem to get decent beans out past Mars for cheap. Not worth the increased power draw on station systems for tropical grow lamps, and there‚Äôs no real profit in importing them when caffeine crystals are easier to ship.

‚ÄúYou really think this time will be different?‚Äù Antony asked as he slid into the booth across from him.

‚ÄúOf course I do. The last few dry tests of your new shielding system blocked out much more external interference‚Äîthe kind we know flips bits and disrupts biological processes. It‚Äôll turn out.‚Äù George said, waving his hand a bit too dismissively to be believable. ‚ÄúWhat? You don‚Äôt trust your own designs?‚Äù

‚ÄúI trust the results of the dry runs. I just don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre able to model the translation environment correctly. How are you so sure the cause is external?‚Äù Antony asked, raising an eyebrow at George.

‚ÄúIt just has to be!‚Äù he yelled involuntarily, causing Antony to lean back slightly.

*I haven‚Äôt seen one of him this agitated in decades*, Antony thought.

At that moment, a non-citizen waitress approached their booth, tablet in hand, ready to take their orders.

Antony offered her a small smile, one she returned a little shyly.¬†

*Maybe she was one of his descendants.* She had similar dark hair, the same stubborn jawline ‚Äî little echoes that were easy to imagine, even after so many generations.

""Coffee, black,"" Antony said gently. ""And... whatever meal special you have today.""

George barely glanced up as he ordered, his thoughts clearly still tangled in calculations and half-solved problems.

As she left the table, George continued.

""Look, I‚Äôm sorry. I‚Äôm just stressed out about the lack of progress on this project. We need this to be possible ‚Äî we can‚Äôt stay in this system.""

""Dark Forest?"" Antony asked.

""Yes, Dark Forest. And it‚Äôs not just the noise I‚Äôve been making with the A.M.P. Jump tests that worries me."" George said, sipping his cup. ""The Empire is shading a larger and larger percentage of the Sun every year. May as well advertise to the entire galactic arm that we have a Dyson swarm ready to be annexed.""



""That‚Äôs only a problem if complex or artificial life can survive FTL without turning into scrap metal or jello. But yeah, I get it ‚Äî if we‚Äôre figuring it out, odds are someone else already has, and we‚Äôre playing catch-up."" Antony said, conceding the point. ""Only one way to find out.""

He pulled a tablet from his bag, scanned through the test logs, and sent a copy to George with a tap.

They went over disappointment after disappointment ‚Äî data corrupted beyond recognition, biologicals reduced to soup.

As they finished eating, there was one last-minute test left to review. A simple visual confirmation was all that was needed.

All fuses blown ‚Äî and that could only happen if the potential across all nodes changed simultaneously, meaning a universal shift in charge.

""It's definitely not external. Look at this,"" Antony said, holding out his tablet. ""It's all happening everywhere at once. I think your drive is making charges interact slightly differently ‚Äî and it's just destroying everything in an instant.""

George stared at the tablet, jaw tight, the silence stretching between them.

""So that‚Äôs it,"" he said finally, voice low. ""All this time... and it breaks reality the moment it works.""

He sank back in his seat, eyes fixed on some far point beyond the diner wall. ""We didn‚Äôt miss a calibration. We didn‚Äôt miscalculate the shielding. It‚Äôs the physics.""

He let out a slow breath. ""We built a miracle... and it kills everything that tries to come with it.""

""So what now?"" Antony asked, a little more carefully than usual.

At that moment, the waitress returned to clear their plates and asked if they wanted anything else.

George kept staring off into the distance, silent.

""We'll take a whole pie, please,"" Antony said, offering her an apologetic smile.

""Pie of the day is apple. That good for you two?"" she asked.

""Yeah, that should be fine. With ice cream, please ‚Äî we could use a bit of a pick-me-up.""

""Got it,"" she said with a quick nod. ""I'll be right back with your pie.""

Only when the pie hit the table did George start to come back from wherever he'd gone.

""Come on, take a slice. We don‚Äôt have anything better to do for a while,"" Antony said, nodding at the melting pastry.

Apples could only be brought this far frozen or candied, so pie was the obvious choice. Ice cream was profitable enough out here to be worth hauling ‚Äî no need to worry about keeping it frozen when space itself did the job for free.

George cut a slice without looking, the motion automatic.

The world hadn't ended. Not yet, anyway.

Antony looked down at the pie.""It's funny,"" he said quietly. ""We can make an apple pie from scratch... but we can't invent the universe.""

George looked up at him, confused.""What are you talking about?""

""Seriously? You've never heard the Carl Sagan quote? 'If you wish to make an apple pie from scratch, you must first invent the universe.' And here I thought you were the physicist.""

Just then, as if an apple had fallen and slammed into his head with the force of Jupiter's gravity, it clicked.

""Your analog thing ‚Äî that kinda recorded some data, right? The fuses recorded what was actually going on inside the ship when nothing else did!"" George whisper-yelled, standing up and almost knocking over the table.

""Uh, yeah, I guess. Why?"" Antony mumbled through a mouthful of pie.

""Because we still have macroscopic memory! Discs, records, crystal storage ‚Äî stuff that doesn't care if the electrons get scrambled for a second! The structure survives ‚Äî the data survives!""

""Yeah, that's true ‚Äî but it doesn‚Äôt really help if the data‚Äôs on the other side of the galaxy and you‚Äôve got nothing to read it,"" Antony said, explaining while wordlessly urging George not to make a scene. ""No software ‚Äî or firmware, for that matter ‚Äî is going to survive the trip. That‚Äôs why we didn‚Äôt consider it in the first place.""

George sat back down, trying to contain his excitement over a half-formed idea.

""We need to reinvent the universe so that our analog signals can be read,"" he said. ""What if we used an analog storage system ‚Äî but loaded it with just enough firmware and software to reprogram a clean, data-free piece of computer hardware? One that‚Äôs only tasked with setting up FTL comms?""

He glanced over, a little hesitantly. He wasn‚Äôt an engineer ‚Äî at least not this version of him. He was a physicist, grasping at a way to salvage decades of research and the unimaginable energy it had taken to manufacture the antiprotons he was literally burning through.

No one was truly bothered by how much antimatter George's project had consumed. Yes, it was energy-intensive to produce ‚Äî even with the slowly growing Dyson swarm around Sol ‚Äî but many in the Empire enjoyed the challenge of meeting that demand with a previously untapped form of energy storage.

Antony was one of them, originally a power systems engineer in his first iteration.

But even more understood the deeper reason: we couldn‚Äôt afford to keep all our eggs in one basket. Everyone knew that when Earth was left behind to focus on the rest of the solar system ‚Äî and a smaller, more determined group knew it when they committed to the slow, sublight journey to Proxima Centauri.

After a moment of quiet ‚Äî and after George‚Äôs uncharacteristic outburst ‚Äî Antony began to pick up the thread.

‚ÄúAnd once we get the FTL comms working, we can remotely program any available hardware from Sol,‚Äù he said.

George looked like he was going to explode from excitement.

‚ÄúBut‚Ä¶ to what end?‚Äù Antony added seriously. ‚ÄúSay we can start up an entire colony remotely with our auto-manufacturing systems ‚Äî it would still take forever for anybody to physically reach it.‚Äù

He glanced around the diner, checking for non-citizens. The waitress was out of earshot.

Leaning forward, he whispered, ‚ÄúYeah, maybe we‚Äôll eventually be able to send a copy of a mind to another star system. But we haven‚Äôt developed the tech to run our minds on a digital substrate. We still need bodies.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we just make bodies with our gestation tanks?‚Äù George asked, more confused than anything.

‚ÄúWe still need living cells to start the cloning process. That hasn't changed in hundreds of years,‚Äù Antony replied, channeling his inner, long-neglected biologist.

‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt we just make cells? Y‚Äôknow, from carbon and water and stuff?‚Äù George shrugged.

Antony looked at him, then down at his tablet.

‚ÄúI need to make a call,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll let you know what we figure out.‚Äù

He tapped the tablet on the table to pay his bill, then stood and headed back toward his shuttle.

*Technically, it‚Äôs possible to create life. But how? What would it take to build a viable animal cell from scratch?*

It probably had never been done ‚Äî not because it was impossible, but because samples were always lying around.

*This is going to be much harder than just sticking people in a ship and pointing it at a star,* he thought as he exited the diner.",15,1745976164.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

1kb4ivf,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Pieds4U/comments/1kb4ivf/the_news/,The News,"The text message had vibrated through Maya‚Äôs hand like a live wire, each buzz sending jolts of disbelief and terror through her body. Your parents have been in an accident. We‚Äôre at St. Luke‚Äôs. The sterile, impersonal words seemed to mock the chaotic storm raging inside her. Her breath hitched, a strangled sob escaping her lips as the phone slipped from her numb fingers and clattered onto the sidewalk.
The world tilted, the familiar afternoon sounds of traffic and distant laughter fading into a muffled hum. All that remained was the icy grip of fear squeezing her chest, stealing the air from her lungs. She had to move, had to go to them, but her legs felt like lead. It was instinct that propelled her forward, a desperate, unthinking urge to reach the one person who always felt like solid ground in a world that suddenly seemed to have fractured beneath her feet ‚Äì Chloe.
Chloe‚Äôs house wasn‚Äôt far, a familiar beacon just a few blocks away. Each step felt heavy, each breath a ragged gasp. The normalcy of the neighborhood ‚Äì kids playing hopscotch, a dog barking in the distance ‚Äì was a jarring contrast to the turmoil within her. How could the world continue to spin when her own had just shattered?
By the time Maya reached Chloe‚Äôs porch, the tears were flowing freely, hot tracks carving paths through the dust on her cheeks. Her body shook with uncontrollable sobs, each one tearing from a place deep inside. She didn‚Äôt even register the sound of her own frantic knocking. All she could see was the blurry image of the text, all she could feel was the crushing weight of the unknown.
The door swung open, and Chloe stood there, her usual bright smile faltering as her eyes landed on the figure huddled on her porch. Maya was a mess ‚Äì her hair disheveled, her face streaked with tears, her shoulders heaving with each ragged breath. The sight of her best friend in such a state sent a jolt of alarm through Chloe.
‚ÄúMaya? Oh my god, Maya!‚Äù Chloe‚Äôs voice was laced with concern as she rushed forward. She didn‚Äôt hesitate, didn‚Äôt ask questions first. She simply wrapped her arms around Maya, pulling her close, letting Maya‚Äôs trembling body lean into her. Chloe‚Äôs embrace was warm and solid, a small anchor in the overwhelming storm.
Maya clung to Chloe, burying her face in her friend‚Äôs shoulder, the dam finally breaking completely. The sobs wracked her body, each one a raw expression of her fear and anguish. Chloe held her tightly, her own heart aching at the sound of Maya‚Äôs distress. She rubbed Maya‚Äôs back soothingly, offering silent comfort, a steady presence in the midst of the chaos.
After a few moments, as Maya‚Äôs sobs began to subside into shuddering breaths, Chloe gently eased her back, her hands still resting on Maya‚Äôs shoulders. Her eyes, usually sparkling with laughter, were now filled with deep concern. ‚ÄúMaya,‚Äù she said softly, her voice gentle but firm, ‚Äúwhat is it? What‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù Her gaze searched Maya‚Äôs tear-stained face, waiting for the words that would explain the raw pain etched there. She was ready to listen, ready to offer whatever support her friend needed, her heart already aching for whatever had caused such profound distress.


Maya looked up at Chloe through a blur of tears, her lips trembling as she tried to speak. The words caught in her throat, choked by the overwhelming emotion. She shook her head, unable to articulate the horror that had seized her. Instead, she fumbled in her pocket, her fingers clumsy and uncoordinated, until she found the crumpled phone. She held it out to Chloe, the screen illuminated with the stark message.
Chloe took the phone, her brow furrowing as she read the short, devastating text. Her breath caught in her own throat. ‚ÄúOh, Maya,‚Äù she whispered, her voice filled with a mixture of shock and sympathy. Her arms tightened around Maya again, a silent offering of support. She could only imagine the terror that must be coursing through her friend.
After a moment, Chloe gently guided Maya into the house. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs get you inside,‚Äù she murmured, her arm around Maya‚Äôs waist, offering a steadying presence. The familiar scent of Chloe‚Äôs home ‚Äì a mix of vanilla candles and old books ‚Äì was a small comfort amidst the turmoil. Chloe led her to the living room and eased her onto the soft cushions of the sofa.
Maya sat huddled, her body still trembling, the tears continuing to fall silently. Chloe knelt in front of her, taking her hands in her own. Her hands were warm and strong, a tangible connection to reality. ‚ÄúTell me what happened, Maya,‚Äù she said softly, her eyes filled with unwavering concern. ‚ÄúTell me everything.‚Äù
Taking a shaky breath, Maya finally managed to speak, her voice hoarse and broken. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ I got a text‚Ä¶ my aunt‚Ä¶ she said‚Ä¶ my parents‚Ä¶ they were in an accident.‚Äù The words tumbled out in fragments, punctuated by sobs. ‚ÄúShe said‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre at St. Luke‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know anything else.‚Äù
The raw fear in Maya‚Äôs voice pierced Chloe‚Äôs heart. She squeezed Maya‚Äôs hands reassuringly. ‚ÄúOkay, okay. We‚Äôll figure this out,‚Äù she said, her voice calm and steady, trying to project a sense of control into the chaotic situation. ‚ÄúWe need to find out what‚Äôs going on.‚Äù
Chloe stood up. ‚ÄúStay here, okay? I‚Äôm going to call your aunt. We‚Äôll get some information.‚Äù She moved quickly, grabbing her own phone from the coffee table. As she dialed the number, she glanced back at Maya, her heart aching at the sight of her friend‚Äôs distress. She knew that this was just the beginning, but she was determined to be there for Maya every step of the way, a solid rock in the face of this sudden, terrifying storm.


Chloe spoke quietly into the phone, her voice a low murmur as she gathered information from Maya‚Äôs aunt. Maya watched her, her gaze fixed on Chloe‚Äôs face, searching for any flicker of reassurance. Each word Chloe spoke felt heavy in the silent room, each pause stretching into an eternity.
When Chloe finally hung up, her expression was grave, but her eyes held a determined glint. She knelt back down in front of Maya, taking her hands again. ‚ÄúOkay,‚Äù she said, her voice gentle but firm. ‚ÄúYour parents were in a car accident. Your aunt said it happened a couple of hours ago. They‚Äôre both at St. Luke‚Äôs, like the text said.‚Äù
Maya‚Äôs breath hitched again. ‚ÄúAre they‚Ä¶ are they okay?‚Äù The question hung in the air, thick with unspoken fear.
Chloe hesitated for a fraction of a second, her gaze softening with compassion. ‚ÄúYour aunt didn‚Äôt have a lot of details. She just said they‚Äôre being evaluated. She‚Äôs on her way to the hospital now. She wants us to meet her there.‚Äù
A fresh wave of tears welled up in Maya‚Äôs eyes. The uncertainty was almost unbearable. ‚ÄúI have to go to them,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling. ‚ÄúI have to see them.‚Äù
‚ÄúI know, you do,‚Äù Chloe said, squeezing her hands. ‚ÄúAnd I‚Äôm going to take you. Right now. Let me just grab my keys and tell my mom where we‚Äôre going.‚Äù
Chloe stood up and moved quickly through the house, her actions purposeful and efficient. She found her mother in the kitchen, explained the situation briefly but urgently, and grabbed her car keys from the hook by the door. Her mother‚Äôs face was etched with concern as she nodded, offering a silent gesture of support.
Returning to the living room, Chloe found Maya still huddled on the sofa, her face pale and drawn. ‚ÄúCome on,‚Äù Chloe said gently, extending a hand. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go.‚Äù
Maya reached out and took Chloe‚Äôs hand, her grip tight. The simple act of physical contact offered a small measure of comfort. As they walked out of the house and towards Chloe‚Äôs car, the bright sunlight seemed harsh and unforgiving, a stark contrast to the darkness that had descended upon Maya‚Äôs world.
The drive to the hospital felt like a blur. Chloe kept one hand on the steering wheel and the other resting on Maya‚Äôs knee, a silent reassurance. Neither of them spoke much. Maya stared out the window, unseeing, her mind racing with a jumble of fear and worry. Chloe focused on the road, her thoughts filled with concern for her friend and a quiet determination to be strong for her.
As they pulled into the hospital parking lot, the imposing building loomed before them, a stark reminder of the crisis they were facing. The air felt thick with tension and anxiety. Chloe parked the car and turned to Maya, her eyes filled with empathy. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre here,‚Äù she said softly. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll find your aunt, and we‚Äôll find out what‚Äôs happening. You‚Äôre not alone, Maya. I‚Äôm here.‚Äù


Stepping out of the car felt like entering a different world. The sterile smell of antiseptic hung in the air, a stark reminder of the sickness and injury contained within the hospital walls. The sounds were a low hum of hushed voices, rolling gurneys, and the occasional muffled page over the intercom ‚Äì a soundtrack to countless personal crises unfolding within the building.
Chloe kept her hand firmly on Maya‚Äôs arm as they walked towards the entrance. Maya‚Äôs eyes darted around, her expression a mixture of fear and confusion. The sheer number of people moving with purpose, the hurried footsteps and worried faces, amplified her own sense of panic. It felt like a place where lives hung in the balance, and the weight of that possibility pressed down on her.
Inside, the reception area was bustling. Chloe approached the information desk, her voice calm and clear as she asked for directions to where accident victims were being received or if Maya‚Äôs aunt had checked in. The woman behind the desk, her expression softening slightly at the sight of Maya‚Äôs distress, provided directions to the emergency department waiting area.
As they navigated the confusing corridors, the fluorescent lights casting a harsh glow on the linoleum floors, Maya clung tightly to Chloe‚Äôs arm. Each turn brought them closer to the unknown, each step amplifying Maya‚Äôs anxiety. The air in the emergency department waiting area was thick with a different kind of tension ‚Äì raw, palpable fear and worry emanated from the clusters of people huddled together, their faces etched with concern.
Chloe scanned the room, her eyes searching for a familiar face. It didn‚Äôt take long to spot Maya‚Äôs aunt, a small, distraught figure sitting hunched in a plastic chair, her face buried in her hands.
‚ÄúAunt Sarah!‚Äù Maya‚Äôs voice was a choked whisper as she recognized her.
Maya‚Äôs aunt looked up, her eyes red and swollen. The sight of Maya seemed to bring a fresh wave of tears. She stood up quickly and rushed towards Maya, engulfing her in a tight embrace.
‚ÄúOh, Maya, honey,‚Äù she sobbed, her voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so sorry. This is‚Ä¶ this is just awful.‚Äù
Maya clung to her aunt, finally allowing herself to fully break down again. Chloe stood slightly back, giving them a moment, her heart aching for both of them. She could see the shared fear and grief in their embrace, the unspoken questions hanging heavy in the air.
After a few moments, Maya‚Äôs aunt pulled back slightly, her hands still resting on Maya‚Äôs shoulders. She looked at Chloe, her eyes filled with gratitude. ‚ÄúThank you for bringing her, Chloe,‚Äù she said, her voice shaky.
‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù Chloe replied softly. ‚ÄúHow are they? Do you know anything?‚Äù
Maya‚Äôs aunt took a deep, shuddering breath. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre both still being examined. The doctors haven‚Äôt said much yet. Your mother‚Ä¶ she has a broken arm and some cuts. Your father‚Ä¶ his injuries are more serious. They‚Äôre doing tests.‚Äù Her voice trailed off, the unspoken fear hanging in the air.
The words hit Maya like a physical blow. Broken arm‚Ä¶ more serious injuries‚Ä¶ tests. The vague terms painted a terrifying picture of pain and uncertainty. Her knees felt weak, and she swayed slightly.
Chloe was instantly there, her arm around Maya‚Äôs waist, offering support. ‚ÄúCome on, let‚Äôs sit down,‚Äù she said gently, guiding Maya to an empty chair.
As they sat together, the weight of the situation settled heavily in the sterile waiting room. The hushed conversations around them faded into a dull background hum. All that mattered was the agonizing wait for news, the gnawing fear of the unknown, and the fragile hope that somehow, everything would be okay. Chloe sat close, her presence a silent promise of unwavering support, a small beacon of strength in the face of Maya‚Äôs unfolding nightmare.


The waiting stretched on, each minute feeling like an hour. The fluorescent lights hummed overhead, casting long, sterile shadows across the room. Maya sat huddled between Chloe and her aunt, a silent tableau of fear and uncertainty. Her aunt occasionally squeezed her hand, a small gesture of comfort that did little to ease the knot of anxiety tightening in Maya‚Äôs chest. Chloe maintained a steady presence, her arm a constant, reassuring weight against Maya‚Äôs side.
The air in the waiting room was thick with unspoken anxieties. A man across the room paced restlessly, his phone pressed to his ear, his voice a low, urgent murmur. A woman in the corner sobbed quietly into a tissue, her shoulders shaking. Each display of distress served as a stark reminder of the countless personal tragedies unfolding within the hospital walls, amplifying Maya‚Äôs own fear.
Maya‚Äôs mind raced, replaying fragmented memories of her parents ‚Äì her mother‚Äôs warm smile, her father‚Äôs booming laugh. The thought of them injured, in pain, was almost unbearable. She kept picturing the sterile white rooms she‚Äôd seen in movies, the beeping machines, the hushed voices of doctors ‚Äì a terrifying landscape of the unknown.
Time seemed to warp and distort. Sometimes, minutes crawled by with agonizing slowness; other times, Maya would drift into a daze, only to be jolted back to reality by a sudden sound or movement. The rhythmic beeping of a nearby medical device seemed to echo the frantic beating of her own heart.
Chloe, sensing Maya‚Äôs distress, gently pulled her a little closer. ‚ÄúDo you want some water?‚Äù she asked softly. Maya shook her head, her throat tight with emotion. ‚ÄúMaybe just a little?‚Äù Chloe persisted, her voice gentle but persuasive. Maya nodded weakly, and Chloe rose to get her a small cup of water from the dispenser in the corner.
The cool liquid felt strange and unfamiliar as Maya sipped it slowly. It did little to quench the dryness in her mouth, a physical manifestation of her fear. Chloe sat back down beside her, her presence a silent anchor.
Finally, after what felt like an eternity, a doctor approached them. He wore green scrubs and a weary expression, his eyes conveying a mixture of professionalism and empathy. Maya‚Äôs heart leaped into her throat. This was it. This was when they would finally know.
Maya‚Äôs aunt stood up quickly, her hands clasped tightly together. Chloe also rose, her gaze fixed on the doctor‚Äôs face, her own anxiety mirroring Maya‚Äôs.
The doctor‚Äôs voice was calm and measured as he began to speak, explaining the extent of her parents‚Äô injuries in careful, clinical terms. He spoke of fractures, contusions, and the need for further tests. For Maya, the words blurred together, a confusing jumble of medical jargon that only served to amplify her fear of the unknown.
The most terrifying part was the uncertainty surrounding her father‚Äôs condition. The doctor explained that his injuries were indeed more serious, and they were still running tests to assess the full extent of the damage. He spoke of the need for close monitoring and the possibility of surgery.
As the doctor spoke, Maya felt a wave of dizziness wash over her. The sterile waiting room seemed to spin, the harsh fluorescent lights blurring into a single, blinding glare. Chloe‚Äôs hand tightened on her arm, a grounding force in the swirling vortex of her fear.
‚ÄúCan‚Ä¶ can I see them?‚Äù Maya managed to whisper, her voice trembling.
The doctor nodded. ‚ÄúOnce they‚Äôre settled. We need to get them into rooms first. But I understand you want to see them. I‚Äôll let the nurses know.‚Äù
The relief that washed over Maya was immense, a small crack of light in the overwhelming darkness. She would see them. She would know for herself.
The wait continued, but now it was different. There was a purpose to it, a sense of anticipation mingled with the lingering fear. They would see their loved ones soon. And in that small hope, Maya found a fragile strength, bolstered by the unwavering presence of her best friend, Chloe, who remained steadfastly by her side, a silent promise of support in the face of the unknown.

The wait for permission to see her parents felt agonizingly long. Maya sat with her aunt and Chloe, the initial shock slowly giving way to a gnawing anxiety. Every passing nurse, every distant announcement over the intercom, made her jump with a mixture of hope and dread. Her aunt kept dabbing at her eyes with a tissue, while Chloe maintained a calm exterior, though Maya could feel the tension in her friend‚Äôs hand holding hers.
Finally, a nurse approached them, her voice gentle. ‚ÄúYou can see your mother now. She‚Äôs in room 312. Just a few minutes, please. She‚Äôs still a bit groggy.‚Äù
Maya‚Äôs heart pounded in her chest. It was a start. Seeing her mother would be something tangible, a way to ground herself in the reality of the situation. She stood up, her legs feeling shaky. Chloe immediately rose with her, but Maya‚Äôs aunt shook her head. ‚ÄúYou go, honey. I‚Äôll wait here for news about your father.‚Äù
Chloe squeezed Maya‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go with you.‚Äù
The walk to the third floor felt like a descent into the unknown. The hospital corridors were quiet now, the earlier bustle replaced by a hushed stillness. The air carried a faint medicinal scent, a constant reminder of where they were.
Room 312 was small and brightly lit. Maya‚Äôs mother lay in the hospital bed, her face pale, an oxygen mask loosely fitted over her nose and mouth. Her left arm was in a cast, resting on a pillow. Seeing her mother like this, so vulnerable and still, sent a fresh wave of emotion crashing over Maya.
‚ÄúMom?‚Äù Maya whispered, her voice thick with tears.
Her mother‚Äôs eyes fluttered open, and a flicker of recognition crossed her face. A weak smile touched her lips beneath the mask. ‚ÄúMaya,‚Äù she murmured, her voice muffled.
Maya rushed to her bedside, her hand reaching out to gently touch her mother‚Äôs uninjured arm. Chloe stood quietly by the door, giving them space.
‚ÄúOh, Mom,‚Äù Maya choked out, tears streaming down her face. ‚ÄúI was so scared.‚Äù
Her mother squeezed Maya‚Äôs hand weakly. ‚ÄúI know, honey. It was‚Ä¶ it was bad. But I‚Äôm okay. Just a bit banged up.‚Äù
Maya leaned closer, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúDad‚Ä¶ how is he?‚Äù
Her mother‚Äôs eyes clouded with worry. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre still‚Ä¶ looking at him. It was‚Ä¶ his side of the car‚Ä¶ took more of the impact.‚Äù A tear escaped her eye and traced a path down her cheek.
The unspoken fear hung heavy in the small room. Maya‚Äôs heart ached for her father, for the uncertainty that still surrounded him. She squeezed her mother‚Äôs hand again, trying to convey strength and reassurance that she herself didn‚Äôt fully feel.
A nurse gently reminded them that visiting time was brief. With a final, lingering look at her mother, Maya backed away, Chloe‚Äôs arm a steady support as they left the room.
Back in the waiting area, Maya‚Äôs aunt looked up, her eyes filled with anxious anticipation. Maya shook her head slightly. ‚ÄúMom‚Äôs awake. She‚Äôs got a broken arm, some cuts‚Ä¶ she‚Äôs worried about Dad.‚Äù
The news brought a small measure of relief, but the larger fear for her father remained. They sat in silence again, the weight of the unknown pressing down on them.
After another long wait, the same doctor approached them again. This time, his expression was serious but held a hint of relief. ‚ÄúMr. [Father‚Äôs Last Name] is out of surgery. It was‚Ä¶ complicated, but it went as well as we could have hoped. He has several fractures and some internal injuries, but we‚Äôve stabilized him. He‚Äôll be in the intensive care unit for a while for close monitoring.‚Äù
A collective sigh of relief swept through the small group. Tears streamed down Maya‚Äôs face, this time a mixture of relief and exhaustion. He was alive. He had made it through surgery.
‚ÄúCan‚Ä¶ can we see him?‚Äù Maya‚Äôs aunt asked, her voice trembling.
‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù the doctor replied gently. ‚ÄúHe needs to rest. But you can see him briefly later, once he‚Äôs settled in the ICU. I‚Äôll let the nurses know you‚Äôre waiting.‚Äù
The news was a fragile beacon of hope in the darkness. The road ahead would undoubtedly be long and difficult, filled with recovery and uncertainty. But for now, knowing that both her parents were alive, that they had made it through the immediate danger, was enough.
Chloe pulled Maya into a tight hug, her own relief evident in her embrace. ‚ÄúSee? I told you we‚Äôd get through this,‚Äù she murmured, her voice thick with emotion.
Maya clung to her friend, finally allowing herself to feel a flicker of hope amidst the exhaustion and fear. The journey was far from over, but for the first time since receiving that devastating text, Maya felt a tiny seed of resilience begin to sprout within her, nurtured by the unwavering support of her best friend, Chloe, who had been her anchor in the storm. They would face whatever came next, together.",1,1745976133.0,u_Pieds4U,0,1.0,False

Here's what I did.,"Hi everyone, I just had my second egg retrieval and hardly any cramps this time. I wanted to share what I did differently than the first time when I had moderately bad cramps that started a few hours after the OR pain meds wore off.

- 1st time, I took Colace right after retrieval. This time, I started the day before (had two the day before (spaced out) & continued to take them after retrieval). If I do it again, I think I would even start earlier than that.
- 1st time I had a bagel with cream cheese + decaf coffee w cream right after retrieval. Later on, I had a chicken wrap, some pasta (which happened to be el dente), and a smoothie. This time, I tried to limit my solids. I only had a decaf coffee with cream after the retrieval. I didn't eat too much during the day. Just water with electrolytes. For late lunch/early dinner, I had fried rice (white) with cooked tofu (no meat) and a liquid soup (it had mushrooms in it but I didn't eat them). In the evening, I had a smoothie. 

I didn't even need any over the counter pain meds at all. Nor did I need heating pads. Whereas last time I needed both of these things for most of the afternoon.

I think the Colace and lack of solid foods made a difference. (Not coincidentally, I also have worse cramps day 1 of my period if I eat solid foods, so that's why I even tried this). I introduced some solids today (had some pistachios) and had some slight cramps start, so I stopped those and got macaroni and cheese (it was not el dente. Pretty soft). Then a smoothie. No cramps. I also had dried strawberries today with no issue. I wonder if the skill of the OR doctor plays a part, too, because I had less spotting this time as well. But I still think we may be able to do things to lessen cramps. I hope this helps some of you :)

You asked? We delivered. üòâCreators can now add up to 5 tags to their Characters to make it easier than ever before to sort and categorize your Characters. Don‚Äôt see the perfect tag?¬† Type it in and select ‚Äúrequest it‚Äù. Update your Characters now, and make it easier than ever before for your fans to find your Characters.¬†

**Note:** Adding tags is currently only available on the website, but you can view tags on both mobile + web.¬†

Scenes are getting a MAJOR update. With our latest release, you can now add ANY Character to a scene! Mix, match and create pure chaos (or epic stories). Will Ghost let you into his mafia? Will Stella turn into a vampire? Main character energy or just there for vibes? Will your favorite Character wreak havoc or have the cutest romance of all time. Choice is all YOURS.

(this feature is coming to Web soon!)

We're working closely with them to prevent this from happening again and truly appreciate your patience as we continue to make our potato¬† as strong as it can be. For the latest status updates on how our servers are doing (in case you don‚Äôt see an announcement posted yet) please check out [status.character.ai](http://status.character.ai) to check on our potato!

In addition to all of these exciting updates, we are very excited to share that we have been working with many of you in the Community to improve and launch new features to better support Creators and improve Character Quality. Our research team has been making progress and you can expect to see new and improved Chat Styles soon.

What about ways to generate money on the side?  
CD's are safe but the deposit has to stay in there for an entire year or until the term is over. 4% return is good.  
  
What other options are there that are low risk?
