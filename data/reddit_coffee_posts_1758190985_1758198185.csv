1nk6owz,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1nk6owz/my_best_friend_and_i_just_killed_each_other/,My best friend and I just killed each other.,"Now that I'm trying to tell the story of how I died, I've found myself appreciating the craft of eulogy more than I ever did in life. I'm finding it difficult to find where the story of my end begins.

It all started with *it*, I suppose. I saw it first on my walk home from work a month ago. I'd stayed late at the coffee shop after my shift was technically over, and that shift had itself only begun after a long day at school, so I wasn't in the best of moods. What helped distract from the foulness of my mood was that me and my buddy, Rick, worked similar hours as part-timers in the city who could only work outside of school hours, and we worked close enough together that we'd meet up after work and head back home together; we lived in the same neighborhood, so at least we had some company in the dark, silent city late at night.

I forgot all about the woes of university life, though, when I saw it. I caught it in the corner of my eye at first, two pale eyes peering out from the darkness of an alley into the street as we walked toward the train station long after the buses had stopped running for the night.

What I thought it was at first, I don't know, but I remember not thinking much of it at the time. A homeless person looking for some spare change, maybe. I didn't say anything to Rick, whose eyes were, as per usual, glued to his phone. I didn't say anything when I saw those two pale eyes, all white with no iris or pupil if my mind wasn't playing tricks on me, set into the bald, papery white skull of the figure that I spotted in the reflection of a store window following not too far behind us a few minutes later. I didn't take it seriously. If I had, perhaps none of this would have happened. If anything, I thought it was annoying; if I was going to get robbed or attacked by a homeless guy, he couldn't have found me at a worse time.

In hindsight, I should have known something was up. Despite its emaciated appearance, it moved in a way that suggested strength and power, with an even stride that made him look as though he was floating and not walking. It was dressed in shades of black, which somewhat hid the disheveled state of its clothes, as it did look very much like a person who slept on the streets, despite the fact that it wasn't wearing very many layers. Even the long coat it wore was thin and couldn't have provided much heat, though the thing never shivered in the cold the entire time my eyes were on it. Rick and I were dressed for the cold and were trembling before we'd walked a block.

It was on the train, too. I knew at once when Rick saw it, because his face went red as he tried not to laugh. Despite my annoyance with that habit of his ‚Äî unfortunate-looking people were one of the funniest things in the world, if you asked Rick ‚Äî I had my own bad habit of laughing when others did, even when it wasn't appropriate. Soon we were both consumed by a fit of laughter that was only silent through our efforts to not break the silence that blanketed the world at such a late hour with our nonsense. It didn't seem to mind. It just stared out at the world passing by out the window. I only realized later, after things outside of my ability to stop had already begun, that it had never cast a reflection onto the window no matter how the light shifted.

When we got off the train, it was time for Rick and I to part ways, and we did so without much fanfare. We'd see each other at school tomorrow. What I thought was a random stranger who'd just happened to catch the same train as us didn't get off at our station, so I put him out of my mind. Just one of those people you meet when you're out late at night. No one of note.

The problems started when I got to the train station two days later ‚Äî Rick sometimes had days off when I didn't, lucky bastard ‚Äî and Rick wasn't there. I texted him to ask whether or not he was going to be late, but he didn't answer. He didn't even read my text, according to my phone. I shrugged it off and went about my day as normal. When I had some free time around noon and saw that Rick still hadn't read my text, I started getting a little bit annoyed at how off I felt without him at my side throughout the day. We took all the same classes, so we were rarely apart; our childish pipe dream was to study game design, which we did, and then open a studio out of the unused garage at my parents' house when we graduated. That had been the goal since we were twelve. I found myself feeling kind of embarrassed by how codependent I must have gotten without even noticing.

I had work again that night, so I couldn't keep checking my phone like I had been throughout the day, but I got the feeling that if I had, I would have continued to see that read receipt showing that he hadn't even seen my message. Instead of being worried, I thought, what a loser! Skipping school wasn't going to get us our studio. The next morning, which I had to myself, I walked to his house a few streets over from mine, the way it had been for near-exactly a decade, and knocked on the door intending to give Rick a piece of my mind. Instead, his mother answered the door, and I swallowed the harsh words that had been on the tip of my tongue in favor of a smile.

""Hey, honey,"" Nancy said quietly, almost whispering. Her voice had the same tight quality as her face. ""Ricky's not well right now, so he might not be up to going out, if that's why you've come.""

That made no sense. If he was just sick, then why the hell had he not answered my texts? ""What's he sick with? Can I talk to him, at least?""

Nancy hesitated before saying, ""Sure, why not?"" The way she said it made me think she was holding something back. I didn't fail to note that even as she walked me to his room ‚Äî I had no clue why she felt the need to do that, considering that I'd been in their home a thousand times before ‚Äî and I asked again, she didn't tell me exactly how he was sick.

At this time, I hadn't seen Rick in three days. I don't think I had gone that long without seeing him since we were fifteen. When I stepped into his room and Nancy closed the door behind me, I'll admit that I cringed at the sight of him. His room was dark, his curtains drawn so that no sunlight could fill the room from outside. It took my eyes a moment to adjust, but when I did, I almost gasped. Rick was a small bundle of pale flesh wrapped in thick, dark blankets on his bed, buried in them. His skin was so white that his veins were visible all over, and he shone with slick sweat. If he wore anything under the blanket, I thankfully couldn't see what. He was not quite gaunt, but he was visibly thinner than he'd been when I last saw him. His eyes were dark still, as was his hair, though his usually bouncy curls were matted to his scalp from the sweat.

I almost blurted out that he looked like shit, which I realized before even opening my mouth wouldn't do any good. That's when the smell hit me, the stench of Rick's sweat-soaked body and the musk of unwashed flesh. His room's window must have been closed, and it must have been closed for a while. I made a noise of shock and disgust, and Rick's face twisted into a wry grin.

""Sorry,"" he said in a dull voice that shared none of the humor in his eyes.

""No problem,"" I said, making an effort not to pinch my nose so I could stop smelling him. ""What's going on, man? Haven't heard from you in a few days. Your mom told me you're sick.""

""Yeah. Sick,"" he mumbled, shifting stiffly under the blankets that he brought up to his neck with shaking arms. ""Don't know with what, but it's bad.""

I nodded slowly, and tried not to breathe in too hard. ""Have you seen a doctor?""

Rick scoffed. ""No. Dad thinks it's just the common cold. Won't hear anything about a doctor."" He laughed, and it carried a sickly wheeze. ""A doctor would have to come to me, anyway. Can't walk. Can barely move my arms. My body feels tight. And cold. Really cold.""

I shuffled on my feet, not knowing what to do to help my best friend feel better. ""Some sun can't hurt. I'll open the curtains.""

Rick sat up so fast that he almost lurched forward. ""No!"" he roared, his voice filled with something that might have been fear or rage. His eyes met mine and I was frozen to the spot by the intensity of his gaze. There was a dark patch where his head had rested on his pillow.

A few moments passed before I gathered enough of my wits to recover. ""Okay."" The smell of Rick's unwashed body, the sharp smell of sweat, filled my nose even more strongly than it had when I was standing at the door. It was a proof of my willpower that I didn't gag. My voice was strained, though, when I repeated myself without anything more to say. ""Okay.""

Rick's eyes filled with pain and he groaned as he laid back down in bed slowly. His movements were jerky and stiff, as if moving was not only painful, but difficult, as if all strength had left his body, or as if his limbs had locked up and relaxing was the hard part. He was left panting afterwards, and my first instinct was to move closer and help him however I could, but the thought crossed my mind that whatever he had might have been contagious, and that kept me where I was, one step from the door.

""Em,"" he said with his strangled, breathless voice. ""You probably shouldn't hang around.""

""Yeah, probably,"" I sighed. I looked around the dark room and instantly regretted breathing deeply enough to sigh. ""Have you talked to our teachers? I won't do your homework for you, but I can set something up.""

""Yeah, that'd be great."" His eyes met mine, and even as his body sagged into his bed after his brief exertion, those dark eyes were burning.

I left after that ‚Äî the smell drove me out just as much as Rick's insistence that he was fine. The whole way home, I took breathed deeply to get the stench out of my nostrils, despite how it burned my nose and lungs. That wasn't the only reason I took my time. I tried to figure out what the hell kind of disease makes a person that kind of sick. I went to our local park and sat while I searched the internet, but I found nothing. Not a single thing matched that he could have possibly caught from anywhere or anyone. It's like his body had just decided to shut down out of nowhere. It bugged me, but there was nothing to do except wait for Rick to get better.

The week that followed was hard. I wouldn't claim that I had it harder than Rick, but I struggled. If three days on my own had made me so thoroughly uncomfortable after a decade of inseparability from my best friend, then I wasn't looking forward to spending what eventually became weeks that way. I had work and school, so I couldn't visit Rick often, which only added to my loneliness. He never read any of my texts, much less answer them. We called a few times, but those calls always left me feeling hollow inside. His voice was a poor replacement for his friendship. I had never been the type to wear earrings, but I started wearing the studs he'd gotten me for my eighteenth birthday a couple of years back ‚Äî they were pure silver, and gleamed even when there wasn't much light. It's just a shame that I can't wear them now.

What really bothered me at the time was that Rick wasn't getting better. Whatever he'd caught, it was *not* a common cold, whatever Rick's dad said. The guy was a neat freak who my mom ‚Äî who had a degree in psychology that proved its worth every day while she worked as a lifeguard at the pool ‚Äî liked to joke with about the OCD diagnosis she knew he'd get if he saw a professional, which he refused to; any kind of illness of the mind or body set him off. It was why he was sleeping in the car while his son worked through this sickness.

About two weeks into my new status quo, I encountered him again. Or, rather, *it*. It had filled out a little in the time since I'd seen it last, and it moved with even more strength and liquid agility than it had had before. It moved like a shadow upon the ground, gliding more than stepping. The Shadow had not emerged from an alley this time, it hadn't stepped out from the darkness. One second, I had been alone on the streets of the city while making my way home in the middle of the night, and the next, the Shadow was there. I made an abrupt left turn as soon as I could without missing a step, not looking where I was going. I had no destination in mind. All I wanted was to not be alone with it.

I glanced back a few steps past the turn and found the Shadow gliding around the corner. It was much closer than it had been mere seconds ago when I had taken my eyes off of it, and that caused my heart to leap up into my throat. I stifled a gasp and picked up my pace a little, because I suddenly got a much better look than I ever had before. My eyes had met the Shadow's, empty and whiter even than its papery skin, which was not as tight around its skull and throat than it had been last time, which I noticed at the same time as the faint pale shine of bone jutting out from between its lips. Bone. No, not bone. Teeth. Prickly dread flashed through me like ice in my veins, and I came to another realization; the Shadow wasn't gaining on me, wasn't catching up ‚Äî it was keeping pace with me.

That was when I realized the Shadow was dangerous. I had been so at ease, so comfortable in my life, that even when a danger had entered my life the first time I spotted the Shadow following us, I had ignored it and carried on with my night. The next turn I made was another left, taken at the nearest available opportunity. As soon as I rounded the corner I started sprinting down the street and looked for any small space that I could tuck myself into so that I could hide. Unfortunately, there were none. I cursed my luck and begged my aching legs to move faster, but I'd just gotten off a longer shift than usual and was just about dead on my feet.

When I glanced back to see whether or not the Shadow was following me, my heart skipped a beat. It wasn't behind me. While my back was still turned away from the direction in which I was running ‚Äî which was back the way I had originally been walking after leaving work after making two left turns ‚Äî I stumbled backwards into what felt like a brick wall. I bounced on impact and fell forward onto my hands and knees. The back of my head I had struck his exposed chest ‚Äî his clothes were in an even worse state than ever ‚Äî burned the way that touching cold metal burns. Looking back, I was met with the towering figure of the Shadow. It had never been close enough to me before for me to properly gauge its height, but it had to be six and a half feet tall. As I scrambled to my feet and backed away from it as it looked down at me with pale, white eyes that almost glowed in the moonlight, I realized another thing.

The Shadow couldn't be human. It had crossed a hundred feet in a second without a sound. The damned thing didn't even look like it breathed, that's how perfectly still it was when it wasn't moving, so I didn't think it had ever risked becoming out of breath through such a physical feat. It could have caught me at any time. Even aside from that, running into it at full speed had felt like crashing into the ground! It hadn't budged an inch. Whoever this person was, if it was a person, was no mere man. Panic flashed through me like a lightning bolt and I turned to run, panting hard as I pushed my body to the limit in a snap decision that hadn't really been much of a choice at all. I was in the hands of my fight or flight response then, and my body chose to flee.

I ran right across the road without checking if it was safe to cross, and almost got pulverized by a car that narrowly missed me by three feet or less. The headlights blinded me for a second, but when I fell on my ass in the middle of the road and stared back the way I'd come and blinked spots out of my eyes, I saw clearly that the Shadow's head turned to follow the car that had nearly killed me slide to a stop halfway through the intersection. It turned back to me and my skin prickled with the heavy anticipation of death as my eyes met its own. The driver, whose hands shook in trembling fists, approached me from where he left his car door hanging open and asked me if I was alright. I glanced at him and told him that I was alright, but when I looked back at where the Shadow had been, almost taunting me with its casual demeanor, it was gone. Only the dark of the night remained where it had stood.

I got a cab home from right there on the street, from the spot that I refused to move from without some form of protection from the Shadow.

The guy who'd almost hit me with his car must have felt really guilty for almost killing some random girl out of nowhere, because he stayed with me the whole time and seemed curious and worried about what a young woman was doing running through the city with such recklessness that she'd almost get herself hit by a moving vehicle. I told him that I had a stalker, and figured it was close enough to the truth that I could get some protection before my cab got there. The Shadow had only left after another person had shown up. Was it scared of getting caught? Somehow I thought it was something else.

When I got home, I didn't mention what happened to my parents right away. In the morning, I only told them what I had told the man who'd stayed with me after the Shadow had disappeared. I had a stalker, and I didn't particularly want to be leaving the house knowing that some creep was out there waiting for me to be alone so it could do whatever the hell it wanted to me. I had no idea what the Shadow might have even wanted from me, since its non-humanity was certain in my mind by then, but my parents certainly had a hunch.

I was thus glad to receive what they called a 'benevolent grounding', happy to be stuck in the house while my parents had me call the police and give them a statement when they showed up shortly after. They said they'd keep in contact if they found the Shadow using my description of him as a guide. I didn't mention its eyes, or its overwhelming physical abilities. I got the feeling that they'd laugh at me if I told them that the man stalking me had purely white eyes that shone in the moonlight and could move faster than I suspected any human could. I didn't know exactly what the Shadow was, but I wanted to find out. My first idea for getting information also happened to be the one person that I wanted to see more than anything at that time.

It took a few days to convince them that nothing bad would happen if I went over to Rick's, though the only thing that got them to agree to it was my acceptance of a bodyguard; my father, who liked to think he was tough because he used to be military, but only had a medal and a limp to show for it. Another of his demands was that he got to finally crack open the safe he hid under their bed and carry the gun he kept in there the whole time we were out of the house. In those few days, I didn't go to school or work. I had my homework delivered by trusted friends, and I got all my shifts at the coffee shop covered for the foreseeable future. A deep cringing shame overwhelmed me the entire time that my dad and I walked the empty suburban streets. Despite that, I was just as anxious as he was, looking over my shoulder and walking quickly. We made it to Rick's place in record time after setting out just as the sun was dipping below the horizon, so that we'd be home in time for dinner.

Nancy answered the door again, and in the second before her whole face changed when she realized who was at her door, I saw clear as day the despair that had made her expression stony and dark. She let them in without a word, and hugged both of us so tight that I thought she might've become so depressed that she'd flipped and become manic and decided to strangle me. When I was free from her iron grip, I excused myself to talk to Rick and started down the hallway. That was, until Nancy called out with a shaky voice and her mania seemed to break, leaving her to plummet back to depression in an instant.

""Wait!"" she cried before realizing she'd yelled and taking a deep breath that seemed to soothe her. ""Ricky's not well, honey. I mean, you knew that, but ‚Ä¶ I don't think he's in the mood for visitors.""

It took me a moment to recover from the feeling of being slapped in the face. ""Why not?""

""He ‚Ä¶"" Nancy struggled with the words. Her legs started shaking, and my dad guided her over to the sofa in their living room where they both sat. When she could collect herself, Nancy explained. ""I don't quite know how to say this."" She laughed, but it was a hollow sound. ""Emily, could you please sit?""

""No,"" I said roughly, fighting the tears that wanted to form in my eyes. I'd never liked getting emotional. When Rick and I had first met, he'd been one of my few classmates back then to not make fun of me for being an overly emotional *girl*. ""What's wrong with him? Why can't he tell me himself?""

Nancy's breath came in shaky huffs of air as she too began to tear up. My parents had always joked that they, both of them being fairly stoic people, had never taught her that little habit of getting worked up easily, and instead I'd learned it from Nancy, since I was over at her house so often. ""He's sleeping right now, but he's become ‚Ä¶ *particular* ‚Ä¶ in his taste in company."" When I stared at her in a silent demand for more, she averted her eyes from mine and stared at the carpet underneath her feet. ""When we got the doctor down here to look at him, something happened to Ricky. He got mad, or maybe scared, and acted out until the poor man left without figuring out what was wrong with him. Every doctor since then has gone through that same thing. He just lashes out. He's stronger than he looks, too ‚Äî especially now ‚Äî so when he gets violent ‚Ä¶"" She paled at even the memory.

Only one thought came to me at that moment. *What in the world?* ""That's insane. Do you need to get the cops down here or what?"" I asked. My turbulent emotions had died down and I had become strangely calm; the shock of hearing all that had driven the sadness away and replaced it with sheer disbelief. The Rick I'd known hadn't been violent. Mostly because he'd never had the muscle mass to be really dangerous. As that thought crossed my mind, I made a connection, though I really, really didn't want it to be true. My suspicion was a crazy thing to just pitch to two rational, normal people, though, so I took a moment to decide on what I wanted to do about it.

I ended up deciding to just walk away from Nancy and my dad and march down the hallway toward Rick's room. I had to see for myself. At that moment, I didn't particular care if whatever he had was contagious or not. His door was already off its hinges when I arrived, and I stood staring at it for a moment before the smell hit me for the second time, all the way out in the hall. It was worse this time. The same odor of sweat and Rick's unwashed body hung in the air, worsened with time, but there was a metallic undercurrent to it this time, the bitter stench of iron that warned me of what I would find in there before I even stepped inside. Within the bedroom it was entirely dark, the curtains drawn and the window closed, and this time I did gag when I got far enough in that sweat and bodily fluids and blood was all that I sensed, so foul and rancid that my knees weakened and I had to stop to recover my balance. I turned his overhead light on and bathed the room in yellowish light that illuminated the scene that will stick in my memory forever.

Rick wasn't anywhere to be seen. A slurry that was more solid than liquid stained the carpet, red and yellow mixed into orange bile that steamed heavily and filled the room with its sickening aroma. The room was cold, so cold that my breath misted in front of my face. His window must have been opened finally, but it did nothing for the smell. There was rotten meat somewhere judging by the stench, and the buzzing of flies that I couldn't see, and I held my breath as I pushed further into the room to find it. A sound that could not have been made by a person made me jump as it echoed slightly from the bathroom attached to Rick's bedroom. The door was closed, and I was hesitant to destroy the memory of first coming to this house and marveling at how Rick had his own private bathroom when I didn't at home, but I walked over and gripped the doorknob tightly as it stung my hand from the cold, just like the Shadow's skin. That reminder pushed me to action even faster.

The smell of rotten meat and blood were only made worse by opening the door. There Rick was, hunched over his toilet and retching, making that awful, ear-splitting noise that had made my whole body erupt with goosebumps. When I screamed, his whole body turned toward me so fast that a cracking sound came from his neck or back, I don't know which. Red stained his lips and chin, and ran down his neck to soak his chest, which was just as bare as the last time we'd seen each other. He suddenly lurched again, and turned back to vomit up a gush of thick, dark blood that dripped from his tongue and lips slowly, as if partially congealed. He breathed wetly, his gasps causing him to choke on more of that thick, chunky blood that must have still been caught in his throat. Another heaving retch later, and something solid fell into the bowl beneath him, which made my blood run just as cold as his must be ‚Äî what he threw up didn't steam at all.

""Em,"" his rasping, flat voice said. He spoke as if it hurt to speak. His eyes caught mine, and I screamed again, but not because of the fresh blood that dripped down his stained face and chest, which was just as dark and clotted as the old blood. I screamed because when I met his eyes, what I saw was not his usual blue pair of bright, happy eyes.

Rick's eyes were white, paler than pale, empty.

""Emily?"" he asked again, slowly standing with a motion so smooth that you would never be able to tell that he had been literally puking his guts up just a second earlier. He moved with a boneless sort of agility, another trait he now shared with the Shadow. ""You finally came. We've been waiting for you."" He did not smile, but amusement of a sort played across his bloody features.

*We.* A thrill of fear shot through me, and I moved on pure instinct, taking off out the door to Rick's room and leaping over the unhinged door. My dad was right there when I fled from the bedroom, peering into the room and blocking my way. I crashed into him and we both went staggering down the hallway, but while my mind was consumed with thoughts and fears of the Shadow and what Rick's resemblance of him might have meant, it was a comfort to know that others around me were not like them. My dad put himself in front of me instantly, and he didn't flinch when Rick's white body emerged from the empty doorframe with an almost slithering grace. Rick's light, bouncing steps brought him a few feet away from my dad and I, and we kept stumbling backwards as he approached slowly with a grim focus on his face.

""Hello, sir,"" Rick said, and he almost sounded like himself, but there was still a breathless rasp to his voice that marked him as different. ""You mind if we talk to Emily alone for a bit? We have a lot to catch her up on.""

""Jesus Christ, kid!"" my dad yelled, putting his hand out in front of him so that there was something between him and Rick. ""You ought to see a doctor.""

""No more doctors!"" Rick roared as he surged forward with serpentine agility. He lurched and tackled my dad, who was still built like a brick wall even ten years after being forced into an early retirement due to the bullet a crazy squad-mate of his had put in his leg in a fit of psychosis, or so they said. They fell to the floor, Rick crouching over my dad's fallen body, and pushed me down the hallway in the process so that I spilled out onto the floor in view of Nancy, who stood and shook like a leaf at the sight of her boy.

As I stood and put as much distance between Rick and myself, dragging Nancy along with me as I backed up against the front door, a window caught my attention at the corner of my eye. I didn't yet know the significance of why the Shadow had only ever appeared at night, but I remembered that Rick had sounded almost scared of the sun when I'd seen him last, so I figured the kind of thing they were ‚Äî because they sure as hell weren't human ‚Äî didn't just prefer the darkness, but actively avoided the light. As soon as half a plan formed in my head, though, I noticed that all that remained of the sunlight had faded to a dull orange halo around the horizon as the sun had just minutes ago set for good.

""Don't you see us?"" Rick said flatly, walking with a posture that showed off how thin he had really become since I'd seen him last. His bones showed through his thin, tight skin, and his shorts hung off him so loosely that they might have fallen off at any moment with some bad luck. His stomach was entirely concave, empty of innards that he had purged in the bathroom mere moments ago. Rick's chest did not rise and fall with the rhythm of breath. He held his arms out and smiled ‚Äî his skin was pulled so taught against his ribs that I expected them to pierce through ‚Äî but his eyes were still that same flat, pale white, empty of the humor that had filled his home, his life, just weeks ago. ""No more pain. No more doctors. We will never need a doctor again.""

Rick turned his back on Nancy and I quickly, and looked back at my dad, who'd forced himself to his knees; getting to his feet from the ground was a thing of the past. His gun, sleek and black, pointed right at Rick's chest, and even though his whole body shook, his hands were still. ""Stand down, son. We can help you, alright? You just need to stand down.""

When Rick moved faster than I'd ever seen a person move before, my dad opened fire. It didn't even look like Rick took any steps, he simply appeared behind my dad as if he hadn't bothered with the distance between them at all. My dad fired three rounds. One impacted the window with the loud sound of shattering glass. Another flew right by my head with a whizzing noise that I didn't process until I realized my face had suddenly became very wet with the red stench of metallic blood, and Nancy collapsed back onto the door behind us with a gasp that turned into a hacking cough as her lungs filled with blood. The third came when my dad must have felt Rick's hands on the back of his head and aimed his gun so that the bullet sailed right through Rick's neck through to the crown of his skull.

Fresh, dark red soaked Rick's entire front and splattered on the wall and ceiling behind him and above. A lot of that red coated my dad's head and shoulders and back. He tried to move away from Rick, to free himself from the grip that only tightened upon getting shot, but those hands were iron and he couldn't pry them off of the sides of his head, untangled those fingers from his shoulder-length hair. Rick's face, which was only intact due to the angle at which the bullet had blown through his brain, contorted in rage and sadness.

""Know this, Frank,"" Rick whispered, his words causing congealed blood to ooze out of his neck wound even faster. ""We regret spilling blood without feeding. We only want to talk. You did this to yourselves.""

Rick's hands moved as though he experienced no resistance from my dad's spine and neck muscles. He twisted my father's head around so quickly and effortlessly that he must have died before his body even jerked and fell to the ground, his chest slumped into the carpet and his lifeless eyes looking up at Rick as the remnant of breath caught in his twisted throat. I screamed again and looked between my dad, dead or dying on the ground with his neck broken, Nancy, bleeding out and shaking as she drowned in her own blood that was quickly soaking into the welcome mat under my feet, and Rick, who seemed no worse for wear after having his brains blasted out of his skull and throwing up all his insides. He was well and truly empty inside, just like those pale eyes that regarded me without emotion as he once again slowly approached with his almost feline gait.

""What are you?"" I screamed as tears streaked down my face. I had come here hoping for answers, but had only gotten blood, and more questions to boot. Trembling where I stood backed up against the front door to Rick's home, I finally broke. ""Stop it! Please, Rick!""

That gave him pause. His dark, thick blood, the blood of a man long dead, flooded down his legs and began sinking into the carpet as he stopped in his approach. ""We *are* Rick."" He said it like he didn't even really know. ""We remember *being* Rick.""

""Do you ‚Ä¶"" I hesitated to ask, now that I had a shot. My body refused to stop shaking, which didn't help. ""Do you remember how you became ‚Ä¶ *us*?""

His empty eyes could have been looking at me or past me for all I knew. ""When we were Rick, we were walking in the night. Night is dangerous, the night hides many things best left unseen and unsaid."" Watching a person talk without having to stop to breathe was uncanny; it gave him a bizarre speaking rhythm, almost like he was trying to force as many words out as quickly as he could, but he never ran out of time. ""A shadow passing in the night. The other us. The one we were before we *were* us.""

""The Shadow,"" I stammered. It was the first time I had said it out loud. ""He came after me again the other day. Did you know that?""

Rick was silent for a moment before speaking again, almost like he was thinking, though I don't know how that was possible with his brain painting the walls of the home we had both loved once. ""No. The other us knows things that the other us does not share. That comes with being the first us.""

""The other you tried to kill me!"" I shouted. The more I learned, the more I saw, the more my fear transformed into rage. ""You're supposed to be my friend!""

""We are your friend, Emily,"" Rick said with an imitation of a smile. ""We would like to keep being friends if possible. That is why we have an offer for you.""

A chill ran down my spine. ""You want me to be like you?""

""Yes. We remember being Rick. We know that we were fond of you, and you of us. If we were *all* us, we could be together. Forever,"" Rick said, holding out his blood-covered hand to me and putting on that fake, empty smile. That smile exposed the pointed ends of teeth that had become sharper than knives.

Clarity filled my mind like a light bulb being switched on. Rick was gone, and this thing wearing his face might have remembered being him, but it clearly didn't remember well enough. Rick and I had been best friends, sure, and received more than our fair share of teasing given that we had been a boy and girl going through the growing pains of puberty together, but our relationship had never been the way everyone thought. We'd been friends to the end. The only feeling I had left for this hollow mimicry of my best friend was regret that I hadn't been with Rick when the end had come sometime in the last two weeks. What stood before me was the Shadow, talking through his mouth, seeing through his pale eyes, making him dance on invisible strings.

I tried to turn and open the door at my back, but the instant my back was to him, Rick's hands, colder than ice, took me by the shoulders and stopped me in my tracks. ""You will see. When you are us, you will see as we do."" The air around my neck grew colder as his head tilted as if to kiss the soft flesh of my throat, and it was at this moment that I realized what Rick had truly become.

""No!"" I screamed, but I had no power to resist his inhumanly strong grip.

His teeth punctured my skin with ease, many sharpened points slicing through my flesh like a hot knife through butter, except they were cold, as cold as his skin. My neck and shoulders were flooded with an indescribable cold that seeped through my muscles right down to the bone as his lips closed over the wounds, and he began to drink up the bright red blood that I could feel his freezing, slimy tongue seeking as it lapped against my warm skin. I writhed against him, trying to pull my head and neck away from his, and to my surprise, it worked. He screamed and lurched away from me so fast and hard that his feet left the ground and he tumbled over the sofa, collapsing on the floor in a boneless heap.

When he rose to his feet again, Rick flesh was smoking and melting away from the bone, the skin around that spot on his cheek was blackened and charred. I stared at him like an idiot before realizing what must have happened and taking the silver earrings out of my ears and clenching my fist around them. I resigned myself to what I had to do. Friends to the end.

When he leapt at me again with his mouth open and wet with my blood ‚Äî I didn't even feel the burn of being bitten; it must have been that numbing cold ‚Äî I let him tackle me to the floor between our dead parents and when the angle was right, I shoved the earrings into his mouth and used the bullet hole in his neck as a handhold to force his mouth shut, even though it didn't really work. He screamed, and smoke and dark, thick blood spilled from his lips and made me splutter and cough. He rolled onto his back and clawed at his mouth, but he couldn't seem to spit it out. When he screamed again, with another waft of black smoke, I got a glimpse of the earrings melted into the roof of his mouth. The smell of cooking flesh filled the air as he thrashed around and smoke began to pour from that neck wound, and the back of his ruined head, and his nose.

Rick went limp after a while of struggling, though the burning continued. Whatever had been keeping him alive must not have been able to fight off the silver, and soon his head was a flaming ball of charred meat. Sometime after the fire had consumed his head but before it spread to his body, I felt something akin to a string snapping, a connection that ran from me to him breaking. I also felt that same thing to something outside. That was a mere moment before the door rattled, something heavy and powerful pounding against it as if intended to knock it right off its hinges. I had no doubt that it could. I went to the door on weak legs and prayed that my suspicion about what Rick was had been correct before opening the door.

The Shadow towered over me in silence, and did not attack. He stood a few steps out from the threshold of the house, and peered in with those empty eyes that had likely seen more than anyone could in one lifetime. ""I see that my thrall has met death after all."" It spoke as if it didn't even truly care about that. ""Very well.""

""So that's it?"" I asked, a little bit breathless as I recovered from the of hearing the Shadow actually talk.

""What is done is done,"" it said, its deep voice filling the silent night outside.

""Am I going to turn into a vampire now, or what?"" I said shrilly as I gestured to the wound on my neck. The Shadow regarded me for a moment with its empty eyes and then turned to leave. ""Answer me!"" I didn't dare go outside and meet it on its turf, and watched as the Shadow melted into a shadow behind Rick's dad's car and vanish. Rick's dad was asleep in the car, his limp body slumped against the steering wheel. I hoped he was asleep.

That was last night. I spent today in Rick's room with the curtains drawn, writing this, because I don't know how much longer I'll have before my fingers and limbs start locking up. Looking up the effects of rigor mortis knowing that it'll be happening to me soon wasn't fun. I already feel cold, and it doesn't matter how many blankets I cover myself with, it's never enough. I don't know what I'm going to do, but I do know that if I survive the change as myself, I'll have the freedom to choose, at least. Killing Rick broke the bond that I would've had with the Shadow, too. At least there's that.",1,1758197887.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nk6gs4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BeautyShine/comments/1nk6gs4/should_you_try_bareminerals_setting_spray_for/,Should You Try bareMinerals Setting Spray for 24HR Matte Control?,"Testing the bareMinerals B0DSM2FJMZ Original Mineral Veil has been a surprisingly intriguing journey. I‚Äôve found myself reaching for this natural matte setting spray nearly every day, curious if it lives up to the bold promises on the bottle. Described as a 24-hour makeup lock with oil control, and boasting an alcohol-free, sweat- and transfer-proof formula, it sounded too good to miss. As someone who struggles to keep their makeup intact through long, humid days, the idea of an ultra-fine mist that actually delivers a smooth, matte finish was too tempting.

**Packaging & First Impressions**

The sleek design of this spray bottle is both portable and stylish, and it feels satisfyingly sturdy in hand. BareMinerals did a great job balancing aesthetics with functionality here‚Äîthe spray nozzle delivers a consistent and fine mist without spitting uneven droplets. It might seem like a minor detail, but trust me, it makes all the difference when trying to avoid a splotchy face.

**Application & Texture**

Using the product is as easy as setting your morning coffee down without tipping it over. A few light spritzes from about six inches away, and you're done. The mist is genuinely ultra-fine, which surprised me‚ÄîI‚Äôve used other sprays that felt more like a garden hose than a gentle cloud. It has a lovely lightweight texture on the skin, and you almost forget it‚Äôs there. No stickiness, no chalky residue, just a soft, invisible layer that somehow manages to keep everything in place.

BareMinerals really nailed this formula for people like me who prefer their makeup to feel breathable. On hectic workdays where I dashed from one errand to another, the spray held its own, keeping my foundation and blush from wandering off my face.

**Good Points**

- Achieves a natural matte finish; no over-the-top flatness.  
- Truly alcohol-free, meaning no drying or irritation.   
- Sweat- and transfer-proof‚Äîtested during intense outdoor activities.  
- Easy-to-use nozzle ensures zero product wastage.  
- Controls shiny T-zones without the need for blotting papers.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The scent is tolerable but might feel a tad too noticeable for some.  
- While effective, the 24-hour claim feels slightly ambitious‚ÄîI noticed some fading around the 18-hour mark.  
- Not the best for dry skin types; it may accentuate certain patches.  

**Performance During the Day**

During workouts or hours of wearing masks, I expected some smudging or clumping in areas like my jawline and around my nose‚Äîcommon problem spots for me. Yet, surprisingly, this spray held strong most of the time. My makeup didn‚Äôt crumble into a tragic mess even after physical exertion or heat exposure. Sure, I saw minor signs of wear by the evening, but nothing drastic. It might not be entirely bulletproof, but it performed better than most competitors I've tried.

[Check bareMinerals B0DSM2FJMZ price on Amazon.](https://paulahansen.com/p/b0dsm2fjmz/)

**Who‚Äôs It For?**

This setting spray aligns perfectly with oily or combination skin users who crave a matte finish but hate the heavy or dry aftermath of similar sprays. If you lean towards dry skin, though, this might not be your best bet unless layered carefully over a hydrating base. I‚Äôve seen my co-worker with a completely different skin type feel less enthusiastic about it. Their feedback? ‚ÄúGreat for shine control but not moisturizing enough.‚Äù

**Competing Products**

Among similar products, the NYX Matte Finish Setting Spray and Urban Decay‚Äôs All Nighter are often compared to this one. While NYX's spray also works well to mattify, I found it lacked the sophisticated, lightweight feel that bareMinerals provides. On the other hand, Urban Decay remains a strong contender due to its iconic staying power, but the price tag might steer some shoppers back to bareMinerals for a more budget-conscious, alcohol-free solution.

**Financial Value**

Considering the premium features like the absence of alcohol and the ability to resist both sweat and oil, bareMinerals offers reasonably solid value for its performance. The price-to-performance ratio feels justifiable when compared to certain high-end brand alternatives. For those mindful of their budget, this product doesn't scream high luxury, but it certainly earns its spot in your beauty arsenal by delivering more than expected.

I (26F) am married to a wonderful person, but he (30M) has one flaw/whatever you want to call it that I just can't deal with anymore: he won't eat.

I suspect he has 'Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder'. He comes home, we have snacks, we have food, sandwiches, candy, you name it, we live close to amazing grocery stores, well, he won't eat anything but cereal and call it a night (this doesn't happen every day, but happened last night). Then, in the morning he drinks coffee and leaves without eating anything. He only eats at lunch (1PM) and he doesn't finish his plate. So he will go on all day on fewer calories than he should and without breakfast, dinner or snacks.

He's not sick, he doesn't have any health issues, no stomach issues, nothing. He's been underweight for years now. The more I tell him I'm worried, the less he eats. It's like he's doing it on purpose at this point. He went to therapy for a good while but didn't mention these issues and didn't want to, he just doesn't think eating is that important, I guess. He won't take care of himself for himself or for me.

I keep telling him to eat, I hand him food, and he always leaves something on the plate, and now I feel like a mom, not a wife. When we take selfies, I feel like I'm standing next to an anorexic person, and maybe I am??

I finally called him out today in a way I hadn't before. I told him 'Look, I am done asking you to care about yourself. I am done. I will mind my own business from now on, but just know I don't support you abusing your own body.' My heart was racing, because I meant it. Our relationship will not be the same anymore, I just can't be around him during breakfast while I eat and he only drinks coffee after basically fasting since yesterday's lunch. I feel like I'm being an accessory to a crime.

I know it's his decision, but for some reason, this breaks my heart. I love nutrition, I love discussing the benefits of foods, vitamins, and teas, but I'm with someone who doesn't care and seems to be mocking life itself at this point.

After a few days I contacted him and asked him out for a coffee because I wanted to get to know him better and I was interested in him. We went on a walk in the city centre together and got our coffee and he told me he had a girlfriend. After this of course I didn't ask him out again and I played it chill. After a couple of weeks we meet again at another event organised for colleagues (we work in same department but we rarely meet normally because we work on different stuff and in different buildings as well). When we met we talked for 10 minutes and he asked me out. We took a beer together. When we talk it is quite nice, we kinda click and he has no flirty behaviour towards me. 

After that, I go on vacation and we I came back we became a bit closer. We texted every now and then. We he knows he is visiting my building for work purposes, he always asks me for a coffee. We have a nice friendship I would say. 
Yesterday night we went to another one to one date.

I actually don't understand what this guy wants from me, if it is a genuine friendship or he is not behaving completely fair with respect to the girlfriend.

At the bar he also paid yesterday for the first time and when we text I feel like he really tries to keep the conversation going. 

I've never met the girlfriend because she lives in another country, like 400 km far away.

New account so I can freely talk about my work. =). 

I am a catering sales manager. I‚Äôve been in the industry since 2010. Went to culinary school for hospitality management, and worked for some of the top catering companies regionally. I‚Äôve worked in fine dining as well so I really thrive on high touch clients.

I‚Äôm also incredibly good at operations. I actually have a second job as an operations manager and I am an operations consultant as a third gig. 

Our operations team is rather inexperienced and I‚Äôve been informally giving tips and tricks to make sure my events (and really everyone‚Äôs events..there‚Äôs 4 sales managers..I‚Äôm just the only catering sales manager) are up to par.

1nk6d3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Menopause/comments/1nk6d3f/hrt_is_working/,HRT IS WORKING!,"I am 55 and went into Menopause about 2.5 years ago and just ""coped."" My biggest issue is hot flashes, about 6-7 severe flashes per night and randomly throughout the day. They really hit with any sudden activity and in the morning while drinking my black coffee (not giving that up!!!). Also joint pain is way worse, pretty irritable, especially the last 6 months or so. And taking weight off was a real struggle üò© 

I will add that I've been fairly consistent with excersize for since my late 20s, definitely falling off that wagon for months at a time, but always getting back on the train. I have always struggled with my weight due to overeating though, and my diet has not always been great. 

About 5 months ago I was at my heaviest ever, 222 lbs!!!! And my Menopause symptoms were even worse because my health was terrible.  I cut all processed food, no sugar unless it came from fruit, cut most simple carbs ( rarely eat bread) and no dairy except the occasional aged white cheese on a salad, and lean meats and fish, with occasional filet mignon.  I also really concentrated on portion control and making sure I had a calorie deficit every day. On top of all that, I started getting on the treadmill 5/6 times week for at least 30 minutes and then followed that cardio with a 30 minute HIIT session, and then a 10 minute ab session.  So in 5 months I'm down to 196 lbs and my energy is amazing!!! I feel really great. EXCEPT the Menopause stuff is all still there!!!!! Hot flashes like crazy!!!!!!  And I'll add that when I followed this same diet/ excersize regimen 4 years ago I'd likely have lost like 40 lbs by now....but Menopause is no joke. It holds that extra weight hostage. 

I decided to take the plunge and now im on day 7 of the estradiol .0025 patch (change it every 4 days) and 100 MG of progesterone pill nightly.  O M G! Last night I only had two extremely mild hot flashes that lasted literally seconds! I actually slept through most of the night! And im just starting on day 7! 

I will say it felt more tired in the afternoon that last 3 or 4 days, but yesterday I did not! Thinking im just adjusting to the progesterone.  I take it before bed and it really helps me feel sleepy. I haven't had any bloating or breast tenderness yet. I do drink about 90 oz of smart water a day, and have done so for years. In fact water all day and black coffee in the morning are my only beverages, aside from the occasional unsweetened iced tea when I go out for dinner . Maybe my constant state of hydration is helping off set any bloating?


Ladies! There is no reason to cope with if you don't have to. Not sure how the HRT journey will pan out for me but im hopeful and excited already on day 7. 

I fantasize about sleeping with my fleece sheets this winter, and not having to carry a mini fan around, and being able to get ready in the morning w/o having to stand in front of a fan after 5 minutes of using the blow dryer, and not sweating off my makeup as soon as i put it on, and being able to wear my cute winter clothes, and having bangs again as they won't be plastered to my head all day after sweating.  But most of all, I fantasize about going to sleep and not waking up until my alarm goes off. 

All this may be in my future!!!!

I‚Äôve been testing it in my home over the past few weeks, and it feels like I‚Äôve invited that one friend who just knows how to spruce up everything!

**A Practical and Versatile Cleaning Solution**  
This powder cleanser promises versatility, and let me say‚Äîit lives up to the claim. I tested it on a variety of surfaces, from chrome faucets to porcelain sinks and ceramic tiles. It even tackled my trusty pots and pans! What impressed me the most was how effectively it removed dirt and grime without leaving any scratches behind. Whether it‚Äôs the bathroom fixtures gleaming or the kitchen counters looking brand-new, this product became my go-to cleaner for nearly every task around the house.

[Check Colgate-Palmolive 10827854009501 price on Amazon.](https://compare.senaar.com/p/b0c5jx325q/)

**An Easy Rinse Formula You‚Äôll Appreciate**  
Have you ever used a cleaner that feels like it clings for dear life, requiring you to rinse and wipe endlessly? That‚Äôs not an issue here. I found the easy rinse formula to be a huge relief, especially when scrubbing surfaces like bathroom tiles where residue can often linger. Every time I cleaned with this powder cleanser, I noticed the reduced effort in managing leftover suds, leaving more time to enjoy a cup of coffee instead of battling with soapiness.  

**Scratch-Free Cleaning Power**  
One of my biggest concerns with cleaning products is whether they‚Äôll damage delicate surfaces. Thankfully, this cleanser understood the assignment. I tested it on my glass stovetop, chrome faucets, and porcelain sink without any hesitation. The result? Not a scratch in sight. My coworker even borrowed it to use on her bathtub and reported the same. That scratch-free promise isn‚Äôt just marketing fluff‚Äîit‚Äôs the real deal.

**Highlights**  
- Wide range of cleaning applications from tiles to cookware.  
- Easy rinse formula saves effort and reduces residue.  
- Scratch-free, making it perfect for delicate surfaces.  

**Stronger Than Dirt, But With Its Limits**  
Despite its ‚Äústronger than dirt‚Äù mantra, I noticed that heavy-duty stains like burnt-on grease needed a bit more elbow grease or an alternative product. Similarly, while it performed admirably on most surfaces, it‚Äôs not ideal for unfinished wood or high-sheen marble. This didn‚Äôt affect me much, but it could be a dealbreaker for others.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Struggles with particularly stubborn, sticky grease stains.  
- Ineffective on certain surfaces like unfinished wood or glossy marble.  

**Rival Brands and Alternatives**  
When I compared this with other well-known brands like Comet and Bar Keepers Friend, the differences became clear. In terms of performance, all three were stellar at removing dirt and grime; however, the Ajax Powder Cleanser stood out with its easy-rinse feature. Bar Keepers Friend, however, tackled tough stains with a little more gusto, whereas the Ajax felt more like the reliable all-rounder. If you need a versatile option for everyday cleaning, this one shines. Do you require something specifically for stubborn grime? You might want to turn to niche products.

**Affordable Quality That Fits Your Budget**  
This powder cleanser offers excellent value for money. When you consider the variety of applications‚Äîchrome, porcelain, ceramics, and even cookware‚Äîthe cost-efficiency stands out. It‚Äôs a solid investment for anyone who‚Äôs done playing the guessing game with products that disappoint. It might not be the fanciest cleaner in the aisle, but it delivers strong, consistent results without breaking the bank.

Hey everyone, long-time lurker, first-time poster here. I just wanted to carve out a quiet corner on the sub and say the words that keep bouncing around my head since the announcement:

Thank you, Scott. Not ‚Äúty for the games lol‚Äù, but thank you for the sleepless nights that didn‚Äôt feel lonely because 50 000 of us were also refreshing Markiplier‚Äôs stream at 3 a.m. Thank you for turning a single, slightly-crooked animatronic bear into a lingua franca for an entire generation.

I was thirteen when my older cousin sat me down at his dusty desktop and said ‚ÄúThis game‚Äôs supposed to be scary, but don‚Äôt worry‚Äîit‚Äôs just robots.‚Äù Thirty seconds later Chica was screaming in my face and I screamed back so hard I knocked over his Dr Pepper. That sticky keyboard was my baptism into the fandom, and I‚Äôve never really left the pizzeria since.

Over the years FNAF became the background radiation of my life. I learned how to edit videos because I wanted to make a ‚ÄúTop 10 Phone Guy Lines‚Äù compilation. I taught myself pixel art so I could redraw the Withereds in the style of EarthBound. I even wrote fan-fiction so edgy it could slice bread‚Äîthen I posted it here under an alt and you guys still up-voted it. Somewhere between the ‚ÄúLore Questions‚Äù megathreads and the ‚ÄúIs Mangle‚Äôs second head a parrot?‚Äù debates, I realized Scott didn‚Äôt just ship us a jumpscare simulator; he shipped us a sandbox.

He let us argue over purple pixels, compose ballads for puppet children, and convince ourselves that a slightly different shade of teal confirmed the Bite of ‚Äô83. He never mocked us for over-thinking‚Äîhe counted on it. Every obscure copyright filing, every ‚Äúrandom‚Äù coffee stain on a teaser, every ‚ÄúSee you on the flip-side‚Äù was an invitation to co-write the story. That‚Äôs why this franchise feels like home: the author built the rooms, but we hung the curtains.

And outside the lore, Scott‚Äôs kindness became its own canon. We all know the stories‚Äîrefunding dissatisfied players, encouraging fan-games, donating to charities that no headline would ever notice. He taught me that you can be both a devout Christian and celebrate kids cosplaying a haunted bunny. That generosity bled into the fandom: artists stream free commissions, musicians remix each other‚Äôs tracks, coders open-source entire engines. Somewhere a 15-year-old is learning C# right now because they want to make the next Popgoes. That ripple effect is Scott‚Äôs legacy, bigger than any single jump-scare.

So yeah, the curtains are closing on new content. But the pizzeria lights aren‚Äôt off‚Äîthey‚Äôre just flickering to let us know we can still roam the halls. I‚Äôll keep revisiting the titles, not just for nostalgia, but to remind myself what community-driven storytelling feels like. And every time I hear that old ‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS ME‚Äù whisper, I‚Äôll smile and remember the guy in Texas who once coded a bear, hit upload, and accidentally sparked the largest crowdsourced ghost story of the internet age.

Thank you, Scott, for the fear, the fun, the friends, and the faith that fans can be collaborators instead of consumers. If you ever read this, know that somewhere a 21-year-old college kid still checks the teaser site on reflex‚Äîbecause you taught us that the next big secret might only be one refresh away.

See you on the flip-side,

‚Äì Mark

over a month ago i was full of fear because of the negative comments i have read about our institution. 

errr i feel like i can‚Äôt really give judgement yet since it‚Äôs only my 1st sem here but, so far so good (üò≠?)

the first 2 weeks of classes were the hardest for me; i had no friends in my block, and i was always alone (as an introverted person). but it really does get better! 

it was challenging for me how everything felt fast-paced at first (3-4 lectures in 2 hours?!). it was also challenging how fast-paced i had to walk to my next class lol

our first LE was math 21, and i was under a LOT of pressure. but in the end, i‚Äôm so proud of myself for managing to get a high score (honestly beyond what i expected). after 3 consecutive (almost) sleepless nights and 9 orders of coffee, it was worth it ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

it was hard to keep up at first. on my first day i looked around and realized that everyone around me must be smarter than me. i started comparing myself, someone ordinary who came from miles away, to others, people who came from known schools here in ncr. impostor syndrome is a canon event HAHAHAH

but i feel like it‚Äôs okay now üßç‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è i remember i randomly looked around our classroom and realized that maybe i already felt like i actually do belong here. i felt like, somehow, im finally in the same pace as rhe others. 

idk why im posting this, maybe because i wanted my fellow iskxs / soon-to-be to stop doubting themselves if they really ‚Äòbelong‚Äô in up. you do. 

or maybe because reviewing for our next LE is messing with my brain lol holy yap

It's a reality for a lot of people. I am married to a wonderful person, but he (30M) has one flaw/whatever you want to call it that I just can't deal with anymore: he won't eat. 

I am suspecting he has 'Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder'. He comes home, we have snacks, we have food, sandwiches, candy, you name it, we live close to amazing grocery stores, well, he won't eat anything but cereal and call it a night. Then, in the morning he drinks coffee and leaves without eating anything. He only eats at lunch and he doesn't finish his plate. 

He's not sick, he doesn't have any health issues, no stomach issues, nothing. He's been underweight for years now. The more I tell him I'm worried, the less he eats. It's like he's doing it on purpose at this point. He  went to therapy for a good while but didn't mention these issues and didn't want to, he just doesn't think eating is that important, I guess.

I keep telling him to eat, I hand him food, and he always leaves something on the plate, and now I feel like a mom, not a wife. When we take selfies, I feel like I'm standing next to an anorexic person, and maybe I am??

I finally called him out today in a way I hadn't before. I told him 'Look, I am done asking you to care about yourself. I am done. I will mind my own business from now on, but just know I will not support you abusing your own body.' My heart was racing. I know it's his decision, but for some reason, this breaks my heart. I love nutrition, I love discussing the benefits of foods, vitamins, and teas, but I'm with someone who doesn't care and seems to be mocking life itself at this point. I don't know if I'm overreacting. I feel so alone and I just really needed to vent and maybe someone will understand and relate. ",1,1758196357.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

All this because of Mizuhara's likely meeting with Umi and Kazuya with Mami. I like to imagine it will be like this:

Kazuya ends up accidentally meeting Mizuhara and Umi, who are distracted and having fun, talking about her role in the play. Kazuya doesn't know why he's laughing, and at a certain point, Umi notices Kazuya's presence and takes Mizuhara's hand. Upon seeing this, Kazuya feels that they are closer than ever, and begins to believe that Umi really is her boyfriend this time.
He doesn't make a fuss or react, but something inside him changes at that moment. On Mizuhara's side, she is shocked by Umi's attitude. Before walking away, she sees Kazuya and notices that his look has changed, a look that she had never seen on him before. Kazuya simply goes on his way without saying anything, and Mizuhara tries to speak, but the words don't come out. She sees Kazuya physically moving away from her and feels that, somehow, he has also moved away emotionally.
She thinks about trying to follow Kazuya, but the fear of seeing that empty and distant look stops her.

A day passes, and Mizuhara considers sending a message, but still doesn't have the courage.

Meanwhile, Kazuya is attending driving school with Mami, and she notices that he is different. She asks him to have a coffee and talk, but he's not in the mood and says he's going home. Mami then says that she will follow him, since she lives in the same region.
In the meantime, Mizuhara can't take it anymore and decides to go talk to Kazuya at his new home. She asks Mini for the address, asking her not to tell Kazuya. Mini, thinking she wants to surprise her, says nothing. She doesn't know about the misunderstanding that has occurred until now.

When Mami arrives in front of Kazuya's new address, she asks to see the inside of the house, and Kazuya, without malice, ends up letting her in. After a few minutes, the doorbell rings, and upon opening the door, Kazuya realizes it's Mizuhara. He is not nervous or anxious, as he was before, wanting to know the reason for the visit. When she tries to say anything, before the first words come out, she realizes that Mami is already there. She goes into shock, but tries not to show it.

Even so, she tries to justify what happened, but Kazuya, calmly and distantly, tells her that he hopes she is happy with Umi and does well in the play. To top it off, he politely tells her that he's busy and, without hesitation, closes the door, leaving Mizuhara unresponsive outside.",3,1758196106.0,KanojoOkarishimasu,0,1.0,False

1nk61zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/cormoran_strike/comments/1nk61zk/a_couple_of_things_discussed_about_thm/,A couple of things discussed about THM,"A couple of things discussed about THM, and accessorily TRG, so spoilers about that one too. 

**1.**About people being annoyed by the massive presence of Charlotte's shadow: 

I guess Strike was too busy to properly mourn what happened to Charlotte in TRG, and accepting Decima's case opened a Pandora's box of memories and new characters, which kept adding layers to Charlotte's problematic personality. I know Strike said that ""there's nothing deader than dead love"", but if Robin will have a chance to work her problems with therapy, Strike has a considerable advantage over her because he was forced to address all the issues that kept resurfacing in THM. And I must add, now we also know the degree of sufferance Strike endured for love, for what he thought was love. In the church of St. John the Baptist he said to an imaginary Charlotte that now he wants something good, for a change, and this is something that after THM made me think, with some apprehension, that Robin doesn't seem to be that good for him (and maybe him for her). They might be astrologically super-compatible, but JKR never told us what she really thinks about astrology...


**2.**About THM seemingly being written in a different style:    

I've read, then listened to the audiobook, and I'm fairly sure I will not read THM ever again. I have read TRG 5 times, just to compare, and listened even more. The first half of THM felt like it was written by Dorcus Pengelly, like someone pointed out already. The narrative expedients simplistic, the inner dialogue of the main characters childish. And btw why have all these people switched to coffee, almost completely forgetting the ritual of English tea? I feel like Dorcus is a coffee drinker.

Today, I‚Äôd like to share a story that was originally posted in OST Group, submitted by NAINA. All credit for the story goes to them and the OST community for keeping these stories alive.


THE CHILDREN IN THE ATTIC PART 2

That evening, I didn‚Äôt go up to the attic. On the one hand, I was afraid of what I might see or experience, and on the other, I was also a bit tired and just wanted to sleep. What was strange was that neither Rich nor Sade had cried at all. After the movie ended, Raisa and I went to bed. The moment my head touched the pillow, I fell into a deep sleep. That wasn‚Äôt normal for me‚Äîbut of course, I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time.

I don‚Äôt know how long I had been asleep when I heard Rich crying faintly in the distance.

I hesitated, unsure if it was a dream or reality. My eyes felt heavy, and I struggled to open them, but the crying didn‚Äôt stop. I could still hear him weeping. I fought to get my eyes open‚Äîit just wouldn‚Äôt work. When I finally realized that Rich was really crying, I started praying. And while I prayed, my eyes suddenly opened.

I immediately looked to my side‚Äîthe space beside me was empty. I jumped out of bed and ran outside. We slept with our bedroom door open, and the door of the children‚Äôs room was open as well.

I quickly checked inside and saw Sade asleep, but Rich was nowhere to be found. I could still hear him crying and ran back into the hallway. The sound seemed to come from downstairs. I looked at Raisa‚Äôs bedroom door‚Äîit was still closed. Slightly annoyed, I thought to myself: How can they sleep so deeply that they don‚Äôt even hear their son crying?

I hurried down the stairs, nearly breaking my neck when I stumbled over something. In the dark, I couldn‚Äôt make out what it was. It looked like a pile of clothes, but when my legs brushed against it, it felt hard.

Of course, I hadn‚Äôt switched on the light, so I couldn‚Äôt see what had been placed right in the middle of the staircase for me to trip over. Meanwhile, Rich‚Äôs cries grew louder and clearer.

I flicked the light on and saw him standing at the front door, struggling with the key. He kept twisting it in every direction, but he couldn‚Äôt seem to get the door open. He stomped his feet in frustration and even screamed as he fumbled with the key.

I grabbed him tightly and pulled him over to the couch. I sat him down and held his little face in my hands.

His face was drenched with tears and snot. He was still sobbing, though no longer screaming. I asked him what he was doing, and he told me that the little boy was back. The boy wanted to take him outside, where more of his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù were waiting to play with him.

I told Rich it was bedtime, not playtime, and asked if he had told the boy that. I glanced out the window but saw nothing‚Äîno one was there.

Rich explained that he didn‚Äôt want to go play because he‚Äôd get cold in his pajamas and, besides, his parents wouldn‚Äôt allow it. That‚Äôs when the little boy got angry. He started hitting and pulling at Rich, forcing him to try and unlock the front door. When Rich couldn‚Äôt manage, the boy grew even angrier‚Äîhe cursed at him, treated him cruelly, and even his ‚Äúfriends‚Äù outside started getting upset.

They began banging on the front door, trying to scare Rich, and it worked. He was terrified.

I asked him, ‚ÄúThey scared you, and still you kept trying to open the door?‚Äù He nodded and said, ‚ÄúThe little boy inside told me that if I didn‚Äôt open it, he would kill me.‚Äù

Out of sheer fear, my little nephew kept twisting the key. Thank God he was turning it the wrong way.

I sat downstairs with him for nearly fifteen minutes. Not once did Raisa or Max come out of their room. I started to get angry with them‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt seem to care what was happening with their children.

Finally, I picked Rich up and carried him back upstairs. Sade was still asleep, but now Raisa‚Äôs bedroom door stood wide open. I frowned, staring at it, wondering if I was going crazy. I could‚Äôve sworn the door had been closed when I rushed downstairs and nearly tripped.


I remembered that thing my feet had hit on the stairs, and it struck me that I hadn‚Äôt seen anything there when I came back upstairs with Rich. I tucked him into his bed and told him I was going to get his mama. I quickly left the room and ran halfway down the stairs to check what I had stumbled over.

There was nothing there.

I hurried back upstairs, knocked on Raisa‚Äôs door, and called out to her.

She woke up quickly and asked what was going on. I told her to step outside because Rich needed her. Out in the hallway, I quickly explained what had happened. She couldn‚Äôt believe her ears and even asked if I was just making things up. I said, ‚ÄúCome, ask your son yourself.‚Äù

Rich was sitting straight up in bed, staring fearfully into the corner of his room. I ignored that for the moment, and Raisa and I sat down beside him. As soon as he saw his mother, he broke into loud sobs again.

By now, Max had woken up too and came into Rich‚Äôs room. I asked Rich to tell his parents what had happened, but he looked at me with fear in his eyes and whispered, ‚ÄúNo, the little boy said I‚Äôm not allowed to tell, or he will kill me.‚Äù

I told him, ‚ÄúOkay, then you don‚Äôt have to say anything.‚Äù Raisa and Max comforted him until he drifted back to sleep. I told them, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll be downstairs if you want to talk.‚Äù

After a while, they both came down. I had made coffee, and they each took a cup. We sat together at the kitchen table, but this time I didn‚Äôt wait for them to ask‚ÄîI spoke first. ‚ÄúSerious things are happening here, and you‚Äôre doing nothing about it. If Rich had managed to open that door, we might never have seen him again.‚Äù

They admitted I was right.

So I decided it was time to tell them what had happened in the attic. I said it was very likely that they were dealing with a bakru (a mischievous spirit child), and based on what Rich had said earlier in the evening, there were even more of them outside. This was not something to take lightly. They promised they would seek help.

But time went on, and they still hadn‚Äôt found anyone who could help them. Meanwhile, Rich and Sade‚Äôs nightly crying continued.

I also began observing more carefully whenever I went up to the attic. I discovered that the ‚Äúthing‚Äù stayed up there most of the time. Whenever I heard it walking, I‚Äôd glance at my laptop screen to see if I could catch its shadow. Often, I saw it peeking over my shoulder.

It gave me chills, but I wasn‚Äôt truly terrified. The thing didn‚Äôt seem to want to harm me‚Äîor maybe it couldn‚Äôt. But whenever it came down the stairs, Rich would cry again.

I concluded that only Rich was really affected‚Äîprobably because he was a boy, and the spirit was looking for a playmate. I couldn‚Äôt find another explanation. But then, why did Sade cry as well?

I wasn‚Äôt often in her bedroom since Raisa always brought her downstairs in the mornings and tucked her in at night. During the day I had no reason to go in there, so I couldn‚Äôt really observe much.

One Friday evening, we were visiting an uncle. Around midnight, Raisa decided it was time to go home, but Max wanted to stay and keep drinking, so Raisa drove me and the children home, since it wasn‚Äôt very far. Max would get a ride home later with one of the cousins.

When we got back home, we immediately went upstairs because it was already quite late. Rich had to be carried, and Sade woke up from all the commotion.


And as we say here in Suriname when we tell these kinds of stories:

Let people share their stories in peace.
We don‚Äôt wish to disturb you; therefore, we don‚Äôt wish to be disturbed.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Detroit Tigers vs. Cleveland Guardians: A Tale of ERAs and Existential Crises**

The Detroit Tigers (-206) and Cleveland Guardians (+172) clash in a battle that‚Äôs less ‚ÄúWorld Series preview‚Äù and more ‚Äúwhy is the second-place team still showing up?‚Äù Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a spreadsheet and the humor of a Twitter thread after a bad coffee.

---

### Parse the Odds: Why the Tigers Are the Bookmakers‚Äô Boyfriend

Detroit‚Äôs implied probability to win this game is \~67%, while Cleveland‚Äôs hovers around 34%. That‚Äôs not a mismatch‚Äîit‚Äôs a one-sided custody battle. The Tigers‚Äô pitching staff (3.92 ERA) and Tarik Skubal‚Äôs 2.26 ERA make them the equivalent of a locked-door policy in a pandemic. Meanwhile, Cleveland‚Äôs offense is so anemic (.226 BA, 27th in MLB) they‚Äôd struggle to score against a vending machine.

Key stat: Detroit‚Äôs offense averages 4.9 runs per game, while Cleveland‚Äôs limps along at 3.9. Think of it like a food fight: Tigers are throwing pies, Guardians are throwing confetti. Both are messy, but only one leaves a stain.

### Digest the News: Injuries, Momentum, and Existential Dread

The Guardians have won 9 of their last 10 games, which is impressive if you‚Äôre a fan of underdog tales or have a soft spot for teams clinging to playoff hope like a toddler to a security blanket. But their recent surge is offset by Tanner Bibee‚Äôs 10-11 record‚Äîa stat line that screams, ‚ÄúI‚Äôd like to play baseball, but I also need therapy.‚Äù

Detroit, meanwhile, has the AL‚Äôs third-best record (85-66) and a bullpen that‚Äôs tighter than a drumhead. Their offense, led by Riley Greene‚Äôs 34 HRs and Gleyber Torres‚Äô .361 OBP, is the reason Cleveland‚Äôs pitching coach probably checks his phone for updates on Skubal‚Äôs pitch count. And let‚Äôs not forget the Guardians‚Äô brutal loss in t

I‚Äôve tested quite a few services‚ÄîUS, UK, CA, FR channels and all. Here‚Äôs my personal ranking of the five I spent the most time with, in the order I‚Äôd use them again.

* * *

### 1\. [IPTVMEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/Reddit_Official_IPTV/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $16/month (with better deals if you commit longer)
    
*   **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD (excellent selection across US, UK, CA, FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 9/10 (streams held up even during UK football nights and US news hours)
    
*   **My experience:** I first tried IPTVMEZZY after hearing about it in a Canadian [**iptv reseller**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) group. The channel variety is huge‚ÄîI could hop from US sports to UK comedies, then check out French news or CA documentaries. I noticed barely any buffering, even during busy times. Their **best iptv trial** gave me a good sense of the lineup before I paid.
    

* * *

### 2\. [XXIPTV](https://www.reddit.com/r/LLptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $15/month (discounts for longer plans)
    
*   **Channels:** 38,000+ live, 130,000+ VOD (very solid for US/UK sports, good CA & FR coverage)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (occasional buffer on major US events, otherwise smooth)
    
*   **My experience:** XXIPTV was recommended to me by a UK friend. I loved using it for Premier League games and catching up on US late-night shows. The Canadian and French content was a pleasant surprise, though I noticed a little lag during live hockey. Setup was a breeze, and the interface was straightforward.
    

* * *

### 3\. [Aurorastreaming](https://www.reddit.com/r/alibabaiptv/wiki/index/)

*   **Price:** $14/month
    
*   **Channels:** 32,000+ live, 105,000+ VOD (excellent for UK/FR, solid US/CA)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 8/10 (great for movies and series; live UK sports sometimes lagged)
    
*   **My experience:** Aurorastreaming turned out to be a bit of a dark horse. Their VOD selection is extensive, especially for classic French and British shows. While most content streamed easily, I had to refresh occasionally during busy live events. Customer support was helpful the one time I needed it.
    

* * *

### 4\. [CloudBox IPTV](https://xxiptv.top/)

*   **Price:** $13/month
    
*   **Channels:** 22,000+ live, 72,000+ VOD (mostly US/UK/CA, fewer FR specialty channels)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (fine for daily viewing, some lag on weekends)
    
*   **My experience:** CloudBox IPTV is my ‚Äúeveryday TV‚Äù pick. It‚Äôs reliable for US news, UK dramas, and Canadian talk shows. French content is more limited but streams well. Signing up for an **iptv subscription 2025** took about two minutes and was hassle-free.
    

* * *

### 5\. NextView Stream

*   **Price:** $12/month
    
*   **Channels:** 15,500+ live, 50,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, handful of CA/FR)
    
*   **Smoothness:** 7/10 (a bit more buffering, especially during US primetime)
    
*   **My experience:** NextView Stream is my ‚Äúbackground TV‚Äù option‚Äîgreat for casual US sitcoms or UK news, but not my go-to for big live events. Their **iptv reseller** dashboard is well-designed if you‚Äôre thinking about that side hustle, but I stuck to watching. It‚Äôs a decent backup, but not my main choice for sports.
    

* * *

My 2025 IPTV Takeaways
----------------------

*   **Always use the best iptv trial**. Every provider feels different depending on your devices and internet.
    
*   Don‚Äôt get wowed by huge channel numbers‚Äîfigure out what you actually _watch_ (for me: UK game shows, US news, and French thrillers).
    
*   Even [**top rated iptv**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/) platforms can have rough nights, especially when everyone‚Äôs watching the same live sports.
    
*   Interested in being an [**iptv reseller**](https://www.reddit.com/r/Best_LPTV/wiki/index/)? Get ready to play tech support for your friends and family.
    
*   And honestly, use a VPN. It‚Äôs just good sense.",0,1758195738.0,RadioRental,1,0.4,False

1nk5wq8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesiFragranceAddicts/comments/1nk5wq8/the_harsh_truth_your_date_night_fragrance/,The Harsh Truth: Your Date Night Fragrance Collection is Coping for Problems Deodorant Can't Fix,"It's Friday evening. You're standing in front of your collection, agonizing between D&G The One and YSL La Nuit De L'Homme for tonight's date. 

Meanwhile, your friend Rahul who owns exactly one bottle of Denver is getting his third Bumble match this week to agree to a second date.

Here's the thing nobody on r/desifragranceaddicts wants to admit: If she's into you, you could show up wearing eau de urine and she'd still find it ""interesting and unique."" If she's not, you could bathe in Creed Aventus and she'll suddenly remember an urgent work deadline.

## The Mathematics of Attraction Nobody Discusses

Let me break down what actually matters on a date, with real percentages:

- **Career/Ambition/Money/Life Direction**: 40%
- **Conversation skills and personality**: 30%
- **Your looks (Physique and Clothes)**: 15%
- **Confidence and body language**: 10%
- **Your restaurant choice**: 3%
- **Your fragrance**: 2%

Yet here we are, spending ‚Çπ20,000 on Tom Ford Noir Extreme to maximize that 2% while walking around with a dad bod and the conversational skills of a particularly boring potato.

## The ""Which Fragrance for First Date?"" Starter Pack

Time to time, someone posts: ""Meeting a girl from Tinder tomorrow, should I wear Dior Sauvage or 1 Million?""

Bhai, she's already decided if she likes you based on:
- Your photos (that one from 2019 when you were 10kg lighter)
- Your bio (where you definitely didn't lie about hiking and treks)
- Your texting game (or lack thereof)

You think she's going to walk into Starbucks, catch a whiff of your Acqua di Gi√≤ Profumo and suddenly forget that you used a Snapchat filter on your profile pic?

## Real Life Case Studies That'll Hurt Your Feelings

**Case 1**: My colleague who owns 40+ designer fragrances, color-coordinates his pocket squares, and has a dedicated ""date night rotation."" Single for 3 years. Spends weekends reorganizing his fragrance cabinet and asking why ""am i single.""


**Case 2**: A friend who discovered one bottle of Davidoff Coolwater in 2023 because he saw a reel of Brigadier Pratap appreciating it, never replaced it, probably applies too much, but is getting married next to next month because he's genuinely funny and has his life together.

## The Uncomfortable Reality Check

You know what's actually turning off your dates? It's not your fragrance choice. It's:

- Talking about yourself for 45 minutes straight
- Getting all anxious and simping in texts if she doesn't reply. (Never do that. Your self respect should be of a trillionaire. If she is not into you as usual, she will definitely not be into you if start acting anxious)
- Checking Instagram while she's talking
- That big belly you ignoring
- Wearing the same wrinkled shirt you wore to work
- Having the emotional availability of a brick

## ""But Fragrance Gives Me Confidence!""

No, it doesn't. It gives you a temporary delusion that molecular aromatics can compensate for lack of personality. That's not confidence, that's escapism in a designer bottle.

Real confidence comes from:
- Actually being interesting
- Having genuine passions beyond collecting smell-good juice
- Being comfortable with yourself
- Good hygiene (yes, regular soap works)
- Being present instead of mentally reviewing your fragrance notes mid-conversation
- And most importantly having the balls to walk away, knowing there are a lot of women out there.

## The Dating App Reality Nobody Admits

She swiped right before smelling you. She agreed to the date before smelling you. She'll decide if she wants to kiss you based on chemistry, not your fragrance chemistry.

Your ‚Çπ15,000 Parfums de Marly Layton isn't going to make her forget that you:
- Lied about your height
- Started being anxious and simping
- Didn't make eye contact because you were nervous
- Or worse, made too much eye contact like a serial killer

## What Actually Works (Spoiler: It's Boring)

1. **Shower with soap** - Any soap. Yes, even Lifebuoy
2. **Use deodorant** - Basic antiperspirant, ‚Çπ200 max
3. **Brush your teeth** - Bad breath kills more dates than wrong fragrance ever could
4. **Wear clean clothes** - That actually fit your current body, not your 2015 body
5. **Optional**: Few sprays of whatever fragrance you already own. Few means max 5.

That's it. That's the formula.

## The ""Date Fragrance"" Posts We Need to Stop

- ""First date with my crush, CDNIM or Montblanc Exploree?""
- ""She said she likes vanilla, should I buy Tobacco Vanille?"" (No, she meant vanilla ice cream, bro)
- ""Rate my date night lineup"" *posts 15 bottles*
- ""Emergency: Date in 2 hours, which decant should I buy?""
- ""She didn't compliment my Aventus, should I try Aventus Cologne next time?""

## The Brutal Bottom Line

Your date doesn't care about your fragrance nearly as much as you think. She cares if you're:
- Interesting to talk to
- Genuinely interested in her
- Hygienic (not the same as fragranced)
- Confident without being arrogant
- Actually looking like your photos
- And most important your life is moving in the right direction 

If you've got those covered, you could wear nothing and do fine. If you don't, you could wear the entire Roja Dove collection and still go home alone to type ""Why did she ghost me?"" on Reddit at 2 AM.

## The Investment Portfolio Reality

That ‚Çπ50,000 ""date night collection"" could have bought:
- A year of gym membership with whey protein (actual results)
- A good skill course like whatever suits your career (Career advancement means more money)
- Cooking classes (useful life skill)
- Better clothes that fit (visual impact)
- Mutual funds (financial stability is attractive)
- A personality (just kidding, those aren't for sale, but you get the point, but you could definitely build a better personality on your own)

## In Conclusion

Stop asking which fragrance will get you laid. Start asking why you think fragrance is your limiting factor.

Your Tinder match isn't going to smell your Tom Ford Oud Wood through her phone screen. Your Bumble conversation isn't going to improve because you're wearing Bleu de Chanel. And that girl at the coffee shop isn't ignoring you because you wore the wrong fragrance - she's ignoring you because you're not that interesting.

Focus on being someone worth dating. The fragrance is just garnish on a dish that needs to be good on its own.

And please,  stop making ""date night fragrance"" posts. We get it, you have a date. Congratulations. Now go be interesting instead of just smelling interesting.

Remember: If she likes you, even Fogg works. If she doesn't, even a Tom Ford Private Blend won't save you.",25,1758195605.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,26,0.88,False

‚Ä¢ I kind off give out a black cat energy; I'm independent and used with my own company but I do my best to match people's energies. 

‚Ä¢ Finished two degrees in STEM. I'm a corporate girlie working for the life I want.

‚Ä¢ INTP but I also yap a lot.

‚Ä¢ I love traveling and as I'm posting this, I'm thinking about my next trip. üèñ

‚Ä¢ I mostly enjoy listening to music! Favorite past time is to also get coffee and read romance novels.

‚Ä¢ Plus size, but I'm working on it. I'm 3 months in to regularly going to the gym and lost a few kilos.

‚Ä¢ I'm looking for something long-term but I'd like to take my time to get to know someone just make sure we're on the same boat.

1nk5sav,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar2/comments/1nk5sav/hypomania_experiences/,Hypomania experiences,"Hello, I feel like in mainstream culture and also here on reddit, conversation about extreme manic episodes is more common, and the books are usually from bipolar people prone to mania and extreme productivity. I don't see as much conversation about what hypomania looks like. I often feel like I'm an impostor because first, I am a huge oversleeper for other health reasons and my reduced sleep means 7-8 hours, not 3-4 hours. I also don't have surreal or paranoid thoughts. So I was told by peers I wasn't really bipolar.

That said, I suffer from episodes I can't immediately recognize and they are painful. If someone says I'm ""manic"" I get angry. I get grandiose thougts of leading a popular movement or uprising, fantasies of various acts I could do, I have an urgency to talk... It can be short lived or interspersed with low days. Yesterday I was feeling a bit distant and unable to focus already, I had a strong coffee (I know, mistake), and made a post on local reddit about doing a mass protest action. When I saw the downvotes and people mocking me I deleted and later realized I was not in a stable state when I wrote it. Today I feel regretful and ashamed. I feel like I'll never be sane or in touch with reality.

Other instances of such episodes included substance use and risky behavior, conflicts and anger, public meltdowns... One time I had an idea for an art project where I took a guitar and sang a song in front of the national parliament. It could be taken as art, as art these days really is varied. But the song I sang had been looping in my mind for weeks before that.

Thank you for reading this far. I'd like to hear more stories/experiences of hypomania to see if I'm alone in this.",2,1758195215.0,bipolar2,0,1.0,False

It's been so long since I've been touched by a man","""Gently... please, be gentle. It's been so long since I've been touched by a man...""  
  
Late into the night, I lay face down on my bed, clutching a pillow. My nightgown was pushed up around my knees, tugged there by the man behind me.  
  
He leaned in, his face brushing against my neck, and began to softly trace my skin with his tongue.  
  
My name is Rebecca Evans. I‚Äôm 38 years old, and I‚Äôm a widow.  
  
Ever since my husband died, I‚Äôve kept to myself‚Äîfocusing on raising my son alone, working hard to give him a good life, praying he‚Äôd grow up to be someone I could be proud of.  
  
But on what started as just another ordinary night, everything slowly began to spiral out of my control.  
  
That afternoon, I was doing yoga in the living room, waiting for my son to come back from training at the Sports Academy. The door clicked open. I glanced up‚Äîand froze.  
  
Standing behind my son was a tall, well-built young man, his eyes drifting down the neckline of my nightgown.  
  
Since my son only came home once a month now, I‚Äôd gotten used to going braless around the house. It wasn‚Äôt until I followed the stranger‚Äôs gaze that I realized‚ÄîI was completely exposed.  
  
I‚Äôve always been busty, and in that forward bend, the loose neckline of my nightgown had fallen open.  
  
The deep curve of my cleavage, the pale swell of my breasts‚Äîeverything was on full display for this stranger standing across from me.  
  
But he was already here. I had no choice but to invite them in. I washed some fruit and brought it over to the coffee table.  
  
""Hello, ma‚Äôam. I‚Äôm Zachary Lowell.""  
  
The young man stood up smoothly from the couch. ""There‚Äôs something I wanted to talk to you about.""  
  
""What is it?"" I motioned for him to sit.  
  
Maybe it was because I was ovulating. Or maybe it had just been too long since a man had looked at me that way. But despite myself, I liked the appreciation in Zachary‚Äôs eyes.  
  
Somewhere in the back of my mind, I knew I should‚Äôve excused myself to put on a bra. But I didn‚Äôt.  
  
Zachary, it turned out, was from San Francisco. He usually went back home during breaks, but with the NCAA Championships coming up, training was going to be intense. Flying back and forth wasn‚Äôt practical, so he asked if he could stay with us for a while.  
  
Of course, I said yes.  
  
Since my husband passed, my son had grown quiet‚Äîwithdrawn. I was desperate for him to spend time with someone like Zachary: confident, outgoing, sure of himself.  
  
Having another man in the house would be‚Ä¶ an adjustment. But if it helped my son come out of his shell? It was worth it.  
  
That same night, I made up the guest bed with fresh linens for Zachary.  
  
But nothing could have prepared me for what happened next.  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
I remember it like it was yesterday.  
  
It was Zachary‚Äôs second night staying with us.  
  
I woke up sometime after midnight, my bladder begging for relief. Trying not to disturb anyone, I slipped out of bed and tiptoed barefoot into the hallway.  
  
The bathroom door was slightly open. Half-asleep, it didn‚Äôt even cross my mind to check if someone was inside. I pushed the door open, already bunching up my nightgown and sliding my panties down.  
  
‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶""  
  
It was too late. There sat Zachary on the toilet.  
  
My sleepiness vanished in a heartbeat.  
  
His boxers were crumpled around his ankles. In one hand, he held his phone‚Äîsoft grunts and a woman‚Äôs moans drifting from the speaker. Any idiot could tell he was watching porn and touching himself.  
  
But my eyes weren‚Äôt on the phone.  
  
They were locked on his other hand.  
  
From where I stood, I had a full view of his toned stomach, slick with a light sweat, and‚Ä¶ well, him. Fully hard. And wrapped around him was the very same thong I‚Äôd taken off just that morning.  
  
As a healthy woman, walking in on a fully grown man like that is shocking enough. But when it‚Äôs your son‚Äôs best friend? My heart hammered against my ribs.  
  
Zachary looked absolutely horrified. He met my eyes for half a second, let out a choked sound, and fumbled to turn off his phone. He didn‚Äôt even pull his boxers all the way up‚Äîjust bolted out of the bathroom like his life depended on it.  
  
Watching him scramble away, I felt dizzy. So awkward. I‚Äôd totally killed the mood.  
  
The whole thing was so bizarre I almost forgot why I‚Äôd come. Then that urgent pressure hit again, and I remembered. I shut the door, lifted my nightgown, and sat down.  
  
The seat was still warm.  
  
As I relieved myself, a familiar musky scent hung in the air. My eyes drifted to a small lavender pile on the floor nearby. My thong. The one he‚Äôd just used.  
  
A hot flush crept up my neck. That little piece of fabric‚Äîwhich had been against my skin all day‚Äîwas what he‚Äôd chosen for his pleasure.  
  
‚ÄúBrat,‚Äù I whispered under my breath.  
  
Annoyance flickered in me, but so did something else‚Äîsomething warm and thrilling. Almost like I wasn‚Äôt in control, I bent down, picked it up, and brought it to my nose.  
  
The scent flooded my senses, short-circuiting every rational thought.  
  
I don‚Äôt know how long I stayed like that. When I finally snapped back to reality, I was horrified at myself. I tossed the thong into the hamper, grabbed a wad of toilet paper, and scrubbed the floor like a madwoman‚Äîerasing any trace he‚Äôd left behind.  
  
My face was on fire. I rushed back to my room and shut the door.  
  
At first, I tried to play it cool. Zachary was eighteen‚Äîof course he had urges. And as a grown woman, I know the effect I can have on young guys bursting with hormones.  
  
But over the next few days, Zachary was off. Nervous. It even rubbed off on my son. I could tell he was terrified I‚Äôd say something.  
  
So I left a note in his room:  
  
I‚Äôm sorry I walked in on you. Your secret‚Äôs safe with me. But please‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt use my underwear anymore. It‚Äôs not clean‚Äîit‚Äôs not good for you.  
  
Maybe I was too gentle. Maybe he took it as an invitation.  
  
Because after that, my worn panties started disappearing. And they‚Äôd always reappear the next day‚Äîdamp and unwashed‚Äîtucked at the bottom of the hamper.  
  
Every morning, after Zachary and my son left for the Sports Academy, I‚Äôd dig them out and hand-wash them in silence.  
  
As time went on, this secret understanding made him bolder.  
  
He‚Äôd ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù drop his fork during dinner. Then his hand would find my leg under the table. His touch was gentle at first, tracing my ankle, then my calf‚Ä¶ until his fingers brushed higher, right where I was growing warm and empty.  
  
I should‚Äôve stopped him.  
  
But I didn‚Äôt.  
  
Instead, I parted my legs just slightly‚Äîgiving him better access. And in the quiet of my mind, I began to imagine things. Rough, urgent things. Him pinning me down. Taking me.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Mom, are you feeling okay? Your face is all flushed...  
  
When my son finally noticed something was off and turned to me with that worried look, the whole forbidden thrill of the moment became too intense to handle.  
  
I practically bolted to my bedroom like my life depended on it.  
  
""Mom‚Äôs not feeling well. You two go ahead and eat without me, and make sure you get to bed early... no staying up late, okay?""  
  
I didn‚Äôt even make it to the bed before I started tearing off my nightgown.  
  
From the very back of my nightstand drawer, I pulled out my most realistic toy.  
  
I spread my legs, flicked the switch, and pointed it toward the living room.  
  
Let‚Äôs be real‚Äîusing toys was nothing new for me.  
  
Especially with my husband away on business for the past six months.  
  
I‚Äôd gotten used to satisfying my urges after my son was sound asleep.  
  
But tonight‚Ä¶ nothing worked.  
  
No matter how I twisted or turned, or how desperately I tried to push myself over the edge, I couldn‚Äôt get there.  
  
My mind was completely consumed by the memory of Zachary‚Äôs‚Ä¶ impressive size.  
  
‚ÄúIf only he was here, pounding into me‚Ä¶ I bet it would feel incredible...‚Äù  
  
I literally wore myself out thinking like that until I finally passed out.  
  
Sometime in the middle of the night, still half-asleep, I felt a hand on me.  
  
A warm palm traced from behind my ear, down my collarbone, over my chest, then around to my hip.  
  
It started kneading my butt like it was shaping dough.  
  
I was lying on my side and instinctively arched back, pressing against that touch.  
  
And then‚ÄîI was fully awake.  
  
My heart was hammering.  
  
Every muscle in my body went stiff.  
  
A cold sweat broke out across my skin.  
  
There were only two other people in this house‚Äîmy son and Zachary.  
  
So who was behind me?  
  
I turned slowly‚Ä¶ and there he was. Zachary. Lying right behind me.  
  
He was tracing slow, lazy circles on my hip with one finger.  
  
‚ÄúAuntie,‚Äù he said with a soft laugh, ‚Äúhow come it‚Äôs all wet right here? Did you have an accident?‚Äù  
  
My face burned. I followed his gaze and saw the soaked spot on the sheets beneath me.  
  
Embarrassment flooded through me.  
  
‚ÄúDon‚Äôt be ridiculous‚Ä¶ How did you even get in here? You need to leave‚Äî‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that,‚Äù he murmured, rising up on one arm. ‚ÄúIf I leave‚Ä¶ who‚Äôs gonna take care of you?‚Äù  
  
And just like that, he stood up beside the bed.  
  
Every inch of him was lean, defined, perfectly built.  
  
And right there, right in front of my face, hung the most jaw-dropping size I‚Äôd ever seen.

1nk5ppl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sleephackers/comments/1nk5ppl/why_we_sleep_scared_me_into_fixing_my_sleep/,"""Why We Sleep"" scared me into fixing my sleep schedule  and it changed everything","Was pulling all-nighters regularly, thought I could function on 5 hours of sleep, and basically treated sleep like a waste of time. This book terrified me into taking sleep seriously and honestly saved my health.

The wake-up call facts:

Sleep deprivation is literally akilling us. Less than 6 hours a night increases your risk of heart attack by 48%, stroke by 15%, and makes you 3x more likely to catch a cold. I thought I was being productive staying up late but instead I learned I was actually destroying my immune system.

Your brain cleans itself during sleep. There's this whole system that flushes out toxins and waste products while you sleep. Skip sleep and all that junk builds up, including the proteins linked to Alzheimer's. Suddenly those late-night Netflix binges felt less worth it.

Sleep loss makes you functionally drunk. After 17-19 hours awake, you're as impaired as someone legally drunk. I was driving to work in this state thinking I was fine. Terrifying in hindsight.

It destroys your memory. Sleep is when your brain transfers information from short-term to long-term memory. No sleep = you literally can't form lasting memories properly. Explained why I'd study for hours but remember nothing.

What I changed:

* Fixed my sleep schedule. Same bedtime and wake time every day, even weekends. Took about 2 weeks but now I naturally get sleepy at 10 PM.
* No screens 1 hour before bed. Blue light blocks melatonin production. Started reading actual books before bed instead of scrolling my phone. Sleep quality improved immediately.
* Made my room a sleep cave. Blackout curtains, cool temperature (65-68¬∞F), no electronics. Your bedroom should be for sleep only, not entertainment.
* No caffeine after 2 PM. Caffeine has a 6-hour half-life. That afternoon coffee was keeping me wired at bedtime without me realizing it.
* Stopped the weekend sleep-ins. Sleeping until noon on Saturday messes up your circadian rhythm for the whole week. Consistency is everything.

The results:

* My energy levels are insane now. I wake up naturally without an alarm, stay focused all day, and actually feel rested. Lost weight without changing my diet. My mood is more stable. Even my skin looks better.
* The scary part: The book makes it clear that chronic sleep deprivation is linked to basically every major disease cancer, diabetes, obesity, depression, anxiety. We're living in a sleep-deprived society and calling it normal.
* I went from thinking sleep was for lazy people to realizing it's the most important thing you can do for your health. 8 hours isn't optional, it's necessary for your brain and body to function properly.

1nk5lle,https://www.reddit.com/r/KnowBeforeBuy/comments/1nk5lle/guide_to_making_your_kitchen_look_bigger/,Guide to Making Your Kitchen Look Bigger,"Most of us don‚Äôt have huge kitchens with endless counters and space for fancy appliances. In reality, many kitchens are small, crowded, or just not designed very well. But here‚Äôs the good part, you don‚Äôt need to tear down walls or spend a fortune to make your kitchen feel bigger.

With the right colors, smart storage, good lighting, and a few design tricks, you can make even a tiny kitchen look more open and inviting. I‚Äôve tried many of these ideas myself while living in a small apartment kitchen, and trust me, they work. This guide will walk you through easy ways to make your kitchen feel brighter, neater, and more spacious without major renovations.

# 1. Color

Color is magic when it comes to space. Light, airy tones make a kitchen feel open, while darker shades shrink it faster than you can say ‚Äúespresso cabinets.‚Äù

**What works best:**

* Stick with whites, off-whites, creams, or soft grays. White kitchens, in particular, bounce light everywhere and blur the boundaries of the walls.
* Monochrome = less chaos. A consistent color scheme across walls, cabinets, and counters avoids that choppy, boxed-in look.
* If all-white feels sterile, add life with plants, a colorful rug, or cute mugs. I once kept a neon-green kettle just to break up the ‚Äúsnowstorm‚Äù vibe of my white-on-white kitchen, it worked.
* Glossy finishes reflect light and make things brighter. Bonus: easier to wipe tomato sauce splatters.

**Pro move:** Paint the ceiling just a shade lighter than your walls, it subtly pulls the eye upward, which makes the room feel taller.

# 2. Tile Tricks

Tiles are more than just ‚Äústuff you spill pasta water on.‚Äù The size and orientation can dramatically change how spacious your kitchen feels.

**Go for:**

* Larger tiles with fewer grout lines. Less visual clutter = more flow.
* Horizontal layouts (wide subway tiles, for example) to make the kitchen look wider.
* Light-colored tiles, especially glossy ones to reflect light.

**Avoid:**

* Busy patterns. They‚Äôll make your kitchen feel like a crowded puzzle.

**Extra hack:** Lay floor tiles diagonally or in a herringbone pattern. It tricks the eye into seeing more movement, which makes the room feel bigger.

# 3. Mirrors and Reflection

Sounds weird, but mirrors in kitchens can be game-changers. A mirrored backsplash behind the stove? Suddenly, it looks like your kitchen doubles in size.

Other reflective ideas:

* High-gloss cabinet doors.
* Stainless steel appliances (they bounce light around).
* Glass cabinet doors or acrylic shelves (lighter on the eye).

One of my friends put a mirror opposite her tiny kitchen window, it doubled the natural light instantly. Her ‚Äúshoebox kitchen‚Äù suddenly didn‚Äôt feel so shoebox-y anymore.

# 4. Let Nature Help You Out

If you can see *past* the walls, the walls feel less‚Ä¶ claustrophobic.

* Big windows, French doors, or glass-paneled doors extend your sightline.
* Plants (especially herbs on a windowsill) soften the boxy kitchen feel. Bonus: you can snack on basil while you cook.
* If you‚Äôre lucky enough to have patio access, bi-fold doors that open all the way are *chef‚Äôs kiss* for space.

# 5. Declutter Like Your Sanity Depends On It

Nothing makes a kitchen feel smaller than clutter. The psychology is simple: the more stuff you see, the more cramped it feels.

**My rule:** Only one appliance gets to live on the counter. For me, it‚Äôs the coffee machine. The toaster goes in a drawer, the blender lives under the sink, and no, the Instant Pot does not get a permanent shrine.

Other smart moves:

* Drawer dividers and pull-out shelves = lifesavers.
* Wall-mounted magnetic strips for knives instead of a bulky block.
* The ‚Äúone in, one out‚Äù rule. Bought a new gadget? Say goodbye to that bread maker you haven‚Äôt touched in two years.

# 6. Open Shelving: Proceed with Caution

Open shelves can be amazing for creating an airy feel, *if* you keep them tidy. If you‚Äôre the kind of person who hoards mismatched mugs from college, maybe stick with closed cabinets.

If you go for it:

* Keep shelves sparse and styled (matching dishware, jars, or plants).
* Use lighter materials like glass or metal.
* Balance them with some closed storage so it doesn‚Äôt look chaotic.

I swapped two cabinet doors for open shelving once and loved it until my partner decided to display our ‚Äúemergency ramen stash‚Äù right in the middle. Let‚Äôs just say, open shelves are only as stylish as the person who‚Äôs stocking them.

# 7. Hide the Appliances

Big, boxy appliances kill flow. The trick is to make them disappear.

* Panel-ready fridges and dishwashers that match your cabinets.
* Built-ins instead of freestanding ovens/microwaves.
* Smaller versions of appliances (do you *really* need a double-door fridge for two people?).

If budget is tight, even just hiding your toaster and blender in a cupboard can make your kitchen feel instantly less chaotic.

# 8. Lighting = Mood + Space

Bad lighting can make even the biggest room feel gloomy. In small kitchens, it‚Äôs a dealbreaker.

Layer your lighting:

* Ambient (ceiling or recessed lights).
* Task (under-cabinet lights).
* Accent (pendants or wall washers).

Stick with cooler white bulbs (3000‚Äì4000K). They mimic daylight and make everything look fresher.

Oh, and dimmers? Worth every dollar. Being able to adjust brightness keeps your kitchen functional *and* cozy.

# 9. Tall Cabinets: Use the Vertical Space

Instead of spreading outward, go upward. Tall cabinets draw the eye up, making ceilings feel higher.

Tips:

* Extend them to the ceiling (no wasted dust-collecting space).
* Use lighter colors so they don‚Äôt feel heavy.
* Glass-fronted cabinets at the very top to keep it from looking blocky.

# 10. Floor Space Matters

You want to see as much floor as possible. That means:

* Downsizing furniture. A wall-mounted drop-leaf table beats a chunky dining set any day.
* Floating pieces (like bar stools with legs) instead of heavy solid bases.
* Hide the trash bin, nobody‚Äôs kitchen ever looked bigger because of a massive dustbin.

# 11. Advanced Ninja Moves

* Transparent furniture like glass tables or acrylic bar stools = practically invisible.
* Built-in seating (like a banquette against the wall) saves more space than freestanding chairs.
* Pegboards for utensils, spices, or pans free up cabinet space.
* If you‚Äôre renovating: open-plan layouts or even a pass-through window to the next room can change everything.

# 12. Budget-Friendly Hacks

Because not all of us can drop thousands on a remodel:

* DIY paint jobs (walls, cabinets, trim).
* Peel-and-stick backsplashes for a glossy, reflective look.
* Thrift-store mirrors to bounce light around.
* Cabinet refacing instead of full replacement.

I once scored a huge wall mirror on Facebook Marketplace for $15. Stuck it in my rental kitchen and boom felt like I added 50 square feet.

# 13. Mistakes That Will Shrink Your Kitchen

* Overcrowding shelves. (Don‚Äôt make your open shelving look like a yard sale.)
* Going overboard with dark colors.
* Neglecting lighting and relying only on one overhead bulb.
* Forgetting that glossy finishes need regular cleaning (grease + fingerprints = not chic).",1,1758194628.0,KnowBeforeBuy,0,1.0,False

For context, our manager asked us to brainstorm solutions to a recurring issue with client communication. I had spent a few evenings putting together a simple framework that I thought could really help. I casually mentioned it to Melissa over coffee, since we often bounce ideas off each other. She seemed supportive at the time.

During the actual meeting, when the manager asked for suggestions, Melissa immediately started outlining my framework almost word-for-word, without any mention that it came from me. I was honestly stunned for a second but then interrupted and said something like, Actually, that‚Äôs something I‚Äôve been working on. I can share the details.

The room got a little awkward. Melissa looked annoyed, but my manager encouraged me to explain further. Afterward, Melissa told me I embarrassed her and made her look bad in front of the team. She said I should‚Äôve just let it go since we‚Äôre all on the same side and credit doesn‚Äôt really matter.

But to me, it does matter, especially because I‚Äôve noticed her doing this kind of thing with other people too, though this was the first time it happened to me directly. Now I‚Äôm wondering if I came across as petty or confrontational for speaking up in that moment.

I was desperate for that promotion‚Äîso desperate I filled the tub with ice and sank into the freezing water until my skin prickled and my whole body tightened. I slathered on scented lotion afterward, the kind that clings to your skin and whispers when you move.  
  
When I walked back into the office, all eyes were on me‚Äîincluding Julian Roscente's. The manager. The one who held my future in his hands.  
  
He took the bait. I could feel it.  
  
""Mr. Roscente,"" I said, my voice softer than usual. ""There's something from the project I don't quite understand. Could I ask for your help?""  
  
He didn't look away. ""What kind of help?""  
  
I took a step closer in my tight jeans. ""Maybe we could discuss it in your office?""  
  
That's when my keys slipped from my pocket and clattered to the floor. I bent to pick them up‚Äîand two buttons on my blouse popped open.  
  
I gasped and tried to cover myself, but I'm a mother of two. There's only so much my hands can hide. And I never wear a bra‚Äîit's just a habit.  
  
The room went quiet. I could feel the men staring.  
  
Then, suddenly, Julian's suit jacket was around my shoulders, and he was steering me firmly into his office.  
  
""Thank you,"" I whispered, biting my lip like some flustered girl.  
  
But he didn't let go. His hand stayed on my arm, warm and possessive.  
  
""Olivia Anderson, right? You're new.""  
  
I nodded. I'd only been here a month. This promotion meant everything.  
  
And Julian had a reputation. I'd heard the whispers. I wasn't about to let this chance slip away.  
  
""Are your children still nursing?"" he asked out of nowhere, his fingers tracing my wrist.  
  
My face flushed. ""They're in elementary school.""  
  
A slow smirk spread across his face. His eyes didn't leave mine. ""Then why do you smell like vanilla and milk?""  
  
The lotion. He noticed.  
  
I looked down, twisting my hands like some innocent. ""I‚ÄîI don't know. It must just be me.""  
  
In one smooth motion, he pulled me against him. His breath was warm against my neck. ""You've had two children, and you still blush like this?"" he murmured. ""How did your husband treat you? Tell me.""  
  
God, he was direct. I'd expected it, but hearing it out loud still threw me.  
  
""My husband's been gone a long time,"" I said, my voice shaky. ""It's been‚Ä¶ a while.""  
  
Then‚Äîhe slapped my hip. Not hard, but enough to make me jump.  
  
""You can't even handle that?"" He laughed, low and arrogant.  
  
He backed me against the desk. His fingers skimmed my waist‚Äîmy skin was still tight and tingling from the ice.  
  
""Mr. Roscente, please‚Äîcan we talk about the project?"" I stammered.  
  
He gripped my hip and leaned in. ""You came in here smelling like dessert and now you want to talk about work?"" His voice was a tease. ""Women are so full of contradictions.""  
  
I was burning up. I couldn't form a word.  
  
This man knew exactly what he was doing.  
  
""Your skin is so fair, though,"" he said, his mouth near my ear. ""How do you keep it like this?""  
  
  
  
Chapter 2  
  
My knees almost buckled beneath me.  
  
For a second, I thought I would actually hit the floor.  
  
Luckily, his strong hands caught me and held me steady.  
  
""My skin has always been this way, ever since I was a kid‚Äî""  
  
Before I could even finish my sentence, Julian's jacket slid right off my shoulders and landed in a heap on the floor.  
  
Now I had nothing to cover myself with.  
  
I gasped and immediately bent down to grab it.  
  
But as I straightened back up, I crashed right into him.  
  
He let out a low, quiet groan.  
  
I scrambled backward, my cheeks burning. ""I'm so sorry‚ÄîI didn't mean to!""  
  
But there was a desk behind me. Even stepping back, I was still way too close to him.  
  
He stood right there, not moving an inch.  
  
One wrong move and I'd be touching him again.  
  
So I just stood frozen, clutching his jacket tightly against my chest.  
  
""Olivia,"" he said, his voice dropping. ""Did you and your husband ever... like this?""  
  
He leaned in closer as he spoke.  
  
In that moment, my whole body went cold. All the blood seemed to rush from my face.  
  
I held the jacket even tighter. ""Mr. Roscente, please don't‚Äî""  
  
But he kept coming closer, not giving me any space.  
  
My face was on fire. My thoughts were spinning.  
  
""Why not?"" he murmured, his voice almost hypnotic. ""Don't you like it? Just give it a try, okay?""  
  
I was sweating all over. Humiliated, I turned my face away.  
  
Then suddenly‚Äîknock, knock, knock.  
  
""Mr. Roscente, I have your coffee.""  
  
A woman's voice came from the other side of the door.  
  
Startled, I pushed Julian away, straightened my clothes, and hurried to open the door.  
  
It was Zoey, one of my colleagues.  
  
She was wearing a slinky dress.  
  
Her skin looked smooth and perfect.  
  
Her figure was absolutely killer.  
  
As she walked past me, she shot me a look of pure disdain.  
  
Then she swayed her hips all the way into Julian's office.  
  
No doubt she was also gunning for that promotion.  
  
That position didn't just come with a pay raise‚Äîit also offered extra vacation days.  
  
Who wouldn't want that?  
  
I clenched my fists.  
  
I made up my mind then and there‚ÄîI was getting that job.  
  
After work, I headed straight home.  
  
I needed an ice bath to keep my skin tight and firm‚Äîall part of the plan.  
  
After all, I'm middle-aged now.  
  
This is the only trick I have left.  
  
I sank into the ice-cold water.  
  
It was freezing. Absolutely biting.  
  
That familiar feeling returned‚Äîthe tightness, the goosebumps.  
  
I reached into the drawer, pulled out an item, lay back in the tub, and snapped a selfie.  
  
Right at midnight, I posted that picture to my Moments.  
  
I set the visibility to Julian only.  
  
The caption read: ""Just another lonely night.""  
  
Julian's always up late. I knew he'd see it.  
  
Sure enough, he messaged me on WeChat the very next second.  
  
""Still awake?""  
  
I waited a moment before answering.  
  
""Thank you for your concern, Mr. Roscente. I've just been under a lot of pressure lately.""  
  
""What kind of pressure?"" he wrote back‚Äîalong with a drooling emoji.  
  
I thought about how he'd acted toward me earlier that day.  
  
Just remembering it made me blush all over again. My scalp tingled.  
  
""The promotion,"" I replied. ""Everyone's going all out. I can't afford to slack off either.""  
  
""Ah, I see. Well, you'll really have to bring your A-game. After all, you are middle-aged. It's hard to compete with the younger girls.""  
  
Yes. I am middle-aged.  
  
My looks naturally can't compare to women in their twenties.  
  
But I'm used to ice baths.  
  
My skin is firmer than most.  
  
Plenty of men still desire me.  
  
I smiled to myself.  
  
Seems like Julian might be interested, too.  
  
I had to step up my game.  
  
I needed to lock down that position‚Äîfast.  
  
""I'll definitely work hard,"" I wrote back.  
  
Early the next morning, after another ice bath, I went to the office.  
  
Julian kept calling me into his office to report on work.  
  
But I kept telling him I was busy.  
  
Playing hard to get works on every man.  
  
This time, that promotion would be mine.  
  
But apparently, Julian couldn't wait until noon.  
  
  
  
Chapter 3  
  
He cornered me against the desk the moment everyone left for lunch.  
  
""Damn it. Do you have any idea how long I've held myself back?""  
  
His voice was a low growl as he breathed me in.  
  
""You smell incredible. Let me find out where that scent is coming from.""  
  
""Mr. Roscente‚Äîyou can't do this‚Ä¶""  
  
He gripped my chin, eyes burning with raw hunger.  
  
""Stop playing innocent. Isn't this what you wanted? Sleeping your way to the top?""  
  
""Since your skin's so soft‚Ä¶ I might just consider it.""  
  
""But first‚Äîyou're going to please me.""  
  
My eyes flickered at the mention of a promotion.  
  
""How‚Ä¶ how should I please you?""  
  
He let out a dark chuckle.  
  
""Tonight. I want you on your knees. In the middle of the street. Completely naked. Begging for my attention.""  
  
""And you'll call me Master.""  
  
I never imagined Julian had tastes like this.  
  
As much as I wanted that promotion, the shame was crushing.  
  
I was still hesitating when I heard the office door begin to unlock.  
  
Julian held me tight around the waist, completely unfazed.  
  
""I don't mind an audience. Let them see how you're climbing the corporate ladder.""  
  
His fingers traced my waistline, teasing, tickling.  
  
I squirmed‚Äîand finally gave in.  
  
But what was he really after?  
  
Was I just another toy for his twisted games?  
  
How many others had there been?  
  
That evening, a package showed up at my door.  
  
From Julian. Inside‚Äîsomething sheer. Barely there.  
  
A text followed: Walking out naked is too bland. Wear this.  
  
But this was worse than nothing‚Äîit was humiliating.  
  
Almost like he read my mind, another message flashed: Finish by midnight, or forget the promotion.  
  
I checked the time‚Äî11:30 PM. I scrambled into the outfit and rushed out.  
  
The fabric dug into my skin. Strangers stared as I passed.  
  
I covered my face and ducked into a deserted alley.  
  
Julian's video call lit up my screen. He was smirking.  
  
""Louder! Beg me.""  
  
Heat rushed to my cheeks. I bit my lip, fighting the turmoil inside.  
  
""Hurry up!"" he pressed.  
  
My voice trembled. ""Master‚Ä¶ please. I beg for your favor.""  
  
Just then, I noticed faces watching from apartment windows.  
  
Julian laughed, clearly satisfied.  
  
""Wait for me. I'm coming to get you.""  
  
I bolted home, changed, and sank into an ice-cold bath, trying to calm my burning skin.  
  
Just as I stepped out, Julian arrived.  
  
His intense gaze locked onto me.  
  
I placed my hands on his shoulders, voice soft and pleading. ""Mr. Roscente‚Ä¶ can we go to your place?""  
  
A sly grin spread across his face.  
  
""My place? You sure? I've got‚Ä¶ interesting things there.""  
  
I nodded eagerly. ""I'm not scared.""  
  
But he didn't move.  
  
""Not yet. We're not that familiar. I don't take just anyone home.""  
  
""Tonight‚Äîwe stay here.""  
  
I pulled back. ""But‚Ä¶ I'm on my period.""  
  
He pulled something out of his pocket‚Äîsleek, sizable.  
  
His eyes never left mine.  
  
""Don't worry. I've got this. It won't hurt you.""  
  
Oh my god. He carried that with him?  
  
I stepped back, throat tight. ""Mr. Roscente, I‚Äî""  
  
He yanked me into his arms before I could finish.  
  
I was shaking, begging now. ""Please‚Ä¶""  
  
""Heh. And you said you wanted to go to my place? You can't even handle this.""  
  
His breath was hot against my ear. ""Call me Master. Beg me to let you go.""  
  
You pervert.  
  
But I had no choice. ""Master‚Ä¶ please let me go. I'm begging you.""  
  
He laughed‚Äîlow, dark, and more turned on than ever.

The Ultimate Double Edged Sword,"Started investing with ¬£5k in 2003 ‚Üíbuilt up to ¬£1.5m now . Frugality + Tech Stocks + a lucky Covid pivot = financial independence in my 30s. Stopped working. Then had an identity crisis, loss of direction and purpose.


TL;DR
I started investing aged 19, I'm early 40s now.
Always lived frugally, invested mostly into in US tech & growth stocks. In early 2020, I made a big, risky Covid pivot into Zoom, Moderna, EVs, AI.

Hit ¬£1m summer 2020. Portfolio now ¬£1.5‚Äì1.8m.

Quit working, wrestled with meaning, purpose, guilt, isolation.
FIRE = freedom to do things, not freedom from needing purpose and direction.

The Journey

The seed money.

At 19 I saved ¬£10k working before uni, spent ¬£5k travelling, came home with ¬£5k left over. Instead of blowing it, I put it in the stock market. That was 2003.

Frugality as fuel

I kept costs rock-bottom:

Walk/cycle instead of cars/taxis
Thermos coffees instead of Starbucks
Packed lunches and homemade sandwiches. 
Local jogging instead of gym membership.

Reduced-to-clear groceries, home cooking, nights in with friends, charity shop clothes, goods second hand from eBay/FB. Kept big spends and nights out to a minimum.

No debt, no lifestyle creep.

Every pound I saved went into the stock market.

Investing choices...

- Started with managed funds, ditched them (fees + underperformance).

- Direct stock-picking in US tech: Amazon, Google, Microsoft, etc.

- Focus on AI, EVs, green tech, solar.

- Dabbled in trading, mostly stuck to buy-and-hold conviction plays.


The Covid pivot

In early 2020, my IT training business I started in 2010, went remote. I‚Äôd been using Zoom for years, so when Covid hit I went all-in: Zoom, Moderna, vaccine stocks, plus EV/AI.

I sold off ‚Äúboring‚Äù dividend stocks and took big concentrated bets. Risky, but it paid off.

The numbers

2003: ¬£5k starting pot

2010s: Saved/invested ~¬£5‚Äì20k annually, depending on how well my business did each year.

Summer 2020: Hit ¬£1m

2020‚Äì25: ¬£1.5‚Äì1.8m portfolio range

Life After FIRE

I essentially stopped ‚Äúworking for money‚Äù in 2020. My second child was born that year and I spent lockdowns at home investing + enjoying family time.

Upside: freedom, time, presence, no boss, no commute.
Downside: identity crisis. Reaching FIRE can kind of remove your goals and purpose. I‚Äôve had to figure out what to do with my freedom. I'm still struggling. 

Now I dabble in new projects, volunteering, learning ‚Äî but at my own pace.

Advice / Caveats / Musings

Frugality matters as much as stock picks. The biggest compounding came from living lean for 20 years.

Luck is real. Timing + Covid pivot gave me a rocket boost. Without that, I‚Äôd have reached FIRE more slowly.

So much privilege and good fortune too. I'm in no way a self made man... my parents paid for my entire education, including private school and uni, then they let me live at home rent-free until my business took off. I since paid them back. Hence I feel huge guilt and imposter syndrome that I don't deserve this and didn't really earn it. 

Stock-picking isn‚Äôt for everyone. Honestly, most people should just index via ETFs, Vanguard, etc. Less stress, fewer sleepless nights.

FIRE isn‚Äôt ‚Äúthe end‚Äù. It‚Äôs a platform. Money = freedom. But you still have to decide what makes life meaningful. ",16,1758194240.0,Fire,2,0.9,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **UEFA Champions League Preview: Club Brugge vs. AS Monaco ‚Äì A Tactical Tango or a Tepid Tie?**

The UEFA Champions League‚Äôs Group Stage has arrived, and the *Jan Breydel* Stadium in Bruges is set to host a clash of titans: Club Brugge vs. AS Monaco. On paper, it‚Äôs a statistical stalemate, like two overcooked waffles arguing about who‚Äôs fluffier. Let‚Äôs dissect the numbers, news, and why this game might end with more drama than a Netflix series about accountants.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Knife-Edge Encounter

The betting market is as split as a Belgian waffle. Club Brugge is the faint favorite at decimal odds of **2.55** (implied probability: **39.2%**), while Monaco hovers at **2.60** (**38.5%**). The draw? A tidy **3.60** (**27.8%**). These odds scream ‚Äúpick a side and pray,‚Äù with bookmakers essentially saying, ‚ÄúBet on the underdog for a 38.5% chance to double your coffee money‚Ä¶ or play it safe with Brugge‚Äôs 39.2% shot at the same.‚Äù

The spread markets add spice: Both teams are priced at even money (no points), with Brugge‚Äôs ‚Äú-110‚Äù line slightly cheaper than Monaco‚Äôs ‚Äú-110‚Äù (depending on the bookie). It‚Äôs the sportsbook equivalent of a staring contest‚Äîno clear winner, just mutual squinting.

As for totals? The ‚ÄúOver 3.0 goals‚Äù line sits at **1.95** (**51.3%**), while ‚ÄúUnder 3.0‚Äù is **1.87** (**53.5%**). In other words, bettors are hedging like a hedge fund manager during a stock market tantrum. Expect a game where both teams forget how to defend but remember how to score‚Äî*eventually*.

### Digesting the News: Health, History, and‚Ä¶ Nothing Much Else?

Here‚Äôs the rub: There‚Äôs no seismic news to report. No star players tripping over shoelaces (yet). No managerial meltdowns or locker-room love triangles. Club Brugge‚Äôs recent fixtures against Salzburg and Rangers in August were‚Ä¶ uneventful, to say the least. Monaco‚Äôs squad, meanwhile, remains a well-oiled machine, though their

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Clich√© Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing clich√© in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clich√©s with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

I am an English guy 

Any women from the USA or Canada please message me I want to hear from you I love your accents 

If you leave any rude or critical comments ln this post you will be blocked 

I am posting many times because I really am very serious about finding someone! I have been on my own way too long now I do not mind where you are located 

This is a genuine post from a genuine user I really want to find someone please be aged between 25 and 32 thanks and please don't be shy to send me a message 

If you are going to be rude or critical please just move on to someone else I‚Äôm really not interested I don‚Äôt know why some have to be so rude on here I have had some that get really rude and nasty in the replies i have received so far there really is no Need for it 

I am an English guy and I am currently living in France I have been here a few years now I absolutely love it but I‚Äôm now wanting to find someone to share my life with. I am very family orientated and family is extremely important to me 

I am seeking a serious relationship I know what I want in life. I have no baggage I‚Äôve never been married before and no previous relationships in fact I‚Äôve never really dated and I‚Äôve never been on dating apps. 

I just haven't found a woman that is suitable enough for me yet to want to be in a relationship with 

I‚Äôd like to find a woman with similar morals and values and boundaries. I really want to be with someone that really appreciates the way I am I am seeking a nice woman with nice standards like mine. 

You‚Äôll find out a lot about me on this post. And please have maturity and decency.

I‚Äôm generally quite a shy guy face to face so this has made it hard meeting others especially women. I am not one of the lads and I also don‚Äôt have many friends I prefer quality over quantity when it comes to friends. I am a very polite patient guy. 

I also don‚Äôt like swearing I rarely use vulgar language on online chats or face to face¬† I am not that type of guy. I also don‚Äôt like those that think it‚Äôs okay to criticise others this is especially true with being friends. I am probably a bit posh and I would describe myself as being upper middle class.¬† 

I am not one that is into partying I don‚Äôt like loud noisy environments I prefer quieter things. I am not one of the lads I have very few male friends. I‚Äôm not into bars or nightclubs they really are not my thing. I really like going¬† to nice restaurants museums a nice beach walking through a park 

I really want to have my own family one day so please be someone that is open to having children in the future I really do want to be a father in the future. I believe I‚Äôm very fertile 

I have been totally celibate by choice all my life I only want to be with one woman and share my body with one woman. It has never appealed to me to be with different women and I could never do anything meaningless This has also never appealed to me. I‚Äôve never been tempted by anyone and I‚Äôd never just sleep with someone for the sake of it. I don‚Äôt view women as one thing and I never will 

I need a strong emotional connection with someone plus I‚Äôd have to get to know someone really well ideally friends first 

It really does not appeal to me to even date different women I‚Äôve never been on loads of dates I‚Äôm not interested in meeting different women I just want to be with one that‚Äôs it just one. 

I do not watch online adult content I don‚Äôt want to use the actual word for it and I don‚Äôt smoke I don‚Äôt drink heavily and I‚Äôve never touched any illegal drugs. I‚Äôve got no bad addictions or bad habits I‚Äôve lived a very clean life. 

I‚Äôm not seeking adult chats on Reddit so if you are looking for this please move on I am not that type of guy.

I take good care of myself I regularly go to the gym and workout often doing intense cardio workouts I‚Äôm in very good health. I am a very strong swimmer I‚Äôve always loved swimming doing lengths my favourite stroke is freestyle this is also my strongest I‚Äôd love to have someone that loves swimming and keeping active as much as I do. I also love going on long walks I do a lot of brisk walking¬† often around the coastline here 

I do love my food and I have been raised on home cooked food I love cooking I‚Äôm not bad at it and I‚Äôd again love to be with someone that also loves her food as much as I do. 

I love eating in nice restaurants too I‚Äôve always been very passionate about this! I also love avocados they are so good for you 

I place a very high value on being intimate with someone it‚Äôs not something I just want to do with just anyone and I don‚Äôt just want to settle I‚Äôve never just wanted to settle I‚Äôm seeking the love of my life someone really special someone I really want to be with. You would be the only woman I would want to come home to at the end of the day. I‚Äôd never have an affair or a fling and I‚Äôm not into ever having an open relationship. I could never cheat on someone I loved and cared about 

I am also someone that sound be very loving supportive kind sweet and caring to you. I will also be very physically affectionate kissing cuddling. 

Where I am in France is very close to the sea it‚Äôs an absolutely beautiful place to live France is a Beautiful country. The coastline in this area is beautiful there are some lovely beaches I‚Äôve been to and we have the lovely √Æle de re island nearby I have been there many times it‚Äôs also beautiful. 

France is a very peaceful relaxing calm country it‚Äôs certainly more peaceful than England. England was too much pressure for me way too stressful too I always wanted to go somewhere else from a very early age. France has amazing food a fantastic healthcare system nice weather in the summer and the winters are not that cold certainly not as cold as England was 

I also love yoga and Pilates both of these I find extremely relaxing they are so good for the body it‚Äôs amazing how good it makes you feel after 

I also love photography taking photos is another passion of mine I can easily go out all day and come back with loads of photos to share. I love technology too especially Apple I‚Äôm very passionate about it. I have a lot of technology that I use and I do have an iPhone 

I also love music I listen to a lot of classical music during the day at home and I am usually listening to classic FM UK which is classical music 24/7 for those that don‚Äôt know. I also love soft rock some of the bands¬† love are a-ha Keane Queen dire straits I listen to a lot of 70s and 80s music. I‚Äôve seen most of my favourite bands live too I‚Äôve been very lucky with that. 

I also love animals I have a dog she‚Äôs a two year old retriever these are the best dogs for me she‚Äôs absolutely lovely. I love being with nature too I love taking walks through forests and the countryside I find this very peaceful and relaxing thing to do. I love spending a while day doing this and going for some nice food after 

When it comes to drinks I love red wine it‚Äôs my favourite but I only have it in moderation I‚Äôve had some lovely bottles of red wine here in France and some of it is also organic. They make a lot of organic food here in France I organic where ever possible as often as possible. 

I keep junk and fast foods to a minimum and have these as a treat I don‚Äôt drink tea and coffee that much I avoid caffeine and I don‚Äôt drink sugary drinks that often either. I am not vegan or vegetarian and I can‚Äôt ever see myself going either way.¬† 

It‚Äôs very important to keep hydrated and I only drink mineral water at least 3L per day and will have more if I go to the gym and have a good workout I always make sure I get myself really sweaty when working out I feel so good after.

I have to be honest and tell you that I don‚Äôt drive I have never passed my test having a car is way too expensive and i have never been that interested in driving. 

I also still live at home with my parents at the moment I‚Äôm not someone that likes living by myself plus the current cost of living especially in England made living by myself too expensive. 

I will also tell you that I am taking a break from work I am in a new country learning the language is my focus at the moment.
I‚Äôm not lazy or anything like that and I cannot cope with stress and pressure in jobs this is again why I‚Äôve had trouble finding suitable work which was hard In England 

So onto to my physical appearance well I am 6ft 4 1.94m very tall and I have a rugby player build you would never lose me in a crowd! I have dark blonde hair and hazel eyes I have freckles on my arms and legs. I have very big hands and feet I am a uk size 13 shoe. 

I have a very natural body type with some stretch Marks in some places like I say I love being natural and my body is very natural. 

My body Is not lean muscular athletic I am natural I have a real man's body which has some fat on it. 

We have very strong genes in my family and we all look younger I don't look My age most say I look like I'm in my late 20s to early 30s. I have no grey hair and I'm not losing any of my hair. I have a full head of nice hair 

I‚Äôm not into being ripped and toned having a six pack has never appealed to me. If your seeking men that are a muscular physique then I won‚Äôt be for you please move on. 

I have a very deep manly voice which can be loud sometimes. I like to voice chat too rather than messaging so if you are comfortable with this I would prefer it. 

I have a naturally smooth chest arms and legs. I don‚Äôt fit in most baths and I have to sleep in a double bed. I love the fact that I‚Äôm very tall but it does have its cons I often get asked when I‚Äôm in shops to reach things on the top shelf! Plus I walk around the house bare foot and I‚Äôm always bashing my feet on things hehe 

I am not addicted to social media and I don‚Äôt aspire to look like men on it or those in mainstream films and reality tv shows. I am not politically liberal either. Id like to be with someone that is not obsessed with social media and you don‚Äôt watch reality tv. I don‚Äôt watch any reality tv at all. 

I have no tattoos no piercings and looking and keeping yourself natural is the best way to go I am a very natural looking man and body to go with it. this is what I believe and it‚Äôs how I‚Äôve been raised too. I have no interest in ever having tattoos or piercings of any kind. I‚Äôd never have any cosmetic surgery 

I like natural looking women that have natural bodies and that don‚Äôt wear heavy makeup also no fake tan or fake nails or fake eyelashes and hair. I also like women that dress modestly and conservatively. I‚Äôd prefer someone with no tattoos and not too many piercings please. Also you don‚Äôt wear a bikini on the beach that is too skimpy. 

I dont have any physical looks requirements other than I like natural looking women 

So if you like what you have read then please send me a message and mention red wine in your message!

Deidre woke with a gasp, clinging tightly to Sakiya in the aftermath of her nightmare. The nine-tail had already drawn Deidre close and was soothingly petting her hair.

""It's alright, my dear,"" Satsuki said softly, ""I'm here.""

It took a few moments for Deidre to collect herself while lying safely engulfed in Sakiya‚Äôs embrace, her natural scent heightened by a slightly musky perfume mixed with the smell of spices and a delicate sweetness that Deidre found comforting. At least the nightmare frequency was beginning to drop. The really pitiful thing about having nightmares was that having them at all was a sign of her recovery. When she'd first arrived, nightmares and dreams of any sort were not part of her sleep process.

She sighed, then drew herself up to kiss Satsuki briefly on the lips, breathing in more of her scent. ""Thank you for being here. Well, I don't think I'll be getting any more sleep for a while, so I'm going to get cleaned up and see if I can finish writing out those ciphers before everyone gets back later today.""

Deidre was under no illusions that what they shared was love. At least, not romantic love. There was certainly mutual affection and physical comfort, but while they were friends and lovers, it would not be correct to say that either of them was in love with the other. Complicated, but that described her life recently anyway.

The past several months had been extremely different from most of her life, Deidre mused as she let her mind wander while she cleaned up and got dressed. When she'd first been captured, her emotions had ranged from numb to confused to angry, then, when hope had first begun to appear, it was swiftly followed by fear. The fear faded slowly as hope grew, but there was still a small, sharp sliver of it lodged in her heart.

Letting herself be seduced and enthralled by Satsuki had been an act of desperate trust, a gamble on being able to change. Working her way free of the enthrallment had helped her work around and push aside more and more of the commands that had been instilled in her, and the effects of becoming Azeria's contractor had finally suppressed those commands entirely.

Not that they were gone, but they were forced to be quiet, no more than faint whispers and a light pressure at the edges of her consciousness. This allowed Deidre to finally talk more about what had been done to her, and eventually that including telling Azeria what they needed to know about 'invading' the territory of her other self.

But once the compulsions were no longer in play, it had still been difficult to talk about much of it. The easiest part had been describing what each of her zones was like. Zones that she tried to not compare against Azeria's equivalent zones. It was painful to see what she could have been doing compared to what she had been forced to do.

Being able to talk more freely had also made it easier to work with Azeria on a cipher so that messages could be discreetly passed to her other self.

However, before she finished that work, Deidre needed to eat. She had a brief breakfast with Satsuki and Payne, which included some special treats provided by Satsuki. While the nine-tail had provided all the useful metals and such up front, she had been teasing the nexus by only slowly revealing some of the food related items that she had brought with her. The juice with today's breakfast was lemonade made from a bright yellow lemon that was sweeter than any of the ones native to this world, and mixed with the red juice from cranberries, which apparently natively grew in acidic bogs. Kazue's core had been excited about the idea of growing them in their wetlands zone, and letting their delvers figure out sweetening them on their own.

Deidre felt a bit sorry for any delvers who tried the bright red berries without sweetening. Deidre's lemonade mix was sweetened enough to make Satsuki laugh at her, and that sweet tooth was why Satsuki had indulged her with an all-sweet breakfast, complete with a flan glazed with caramelized sugar. Even the small cup of coffee was almost half cream and sugar. Much of her life, she'd been fed only cheap food, and found herself craving intense flavors and sweetness now that she had access.

After breakfast, she and Payne, whose mouth was still stained with jam, went to the office where all this work was being done.

Deidre needed to write each piece of their secret message by hand, though the cores made sure everything was ready for her reference. One part of this was that the nexus couldn't simply generate the scraps and ink from their mana, so Deidre was using paper and ink that had been either brought in from outside or had been processed from plants that had been grown in the nexus territory. There was a large variety of bits of paper that lay before her, from smooth heavy vellum, to standard paper, and most importantly, rough paper with bits of plant matter and seeds embedded in it. The seeds were from Azeria‚Äôs plant life, and Satsuki had slipped bits of coffee leaf into one sheet; gifts for her nexus to rebuild with, if all went to plan. She gripped the glass pen in her hand, another thing for her dungeon to learn to make, she thought.

These tokens were small in the scale of what can teach and empower a nexus, but they were tokens that would be freely given even while the nexus was being 'invaded'. The more valuable, dangerous things would be reserved until she was free, but these would help build trust. Hopefully.

The other part was that this put the entire thing in Deidre's handwriting and allowed her to imprint a trace of her aura on everything. It was not as thorough as a properly done seal, but keeping the signature of her aura faint was part of the point, as delivering the message was intended to be done subtly.

There were actually two ciphers, and the ciphers were broken up into small pieces of mathematical equations written on random scraps of the paper before her. There were also two messages, written in seeming gibberish on the other side of each scrap of paper. The first message was written on the scraps containing the second cipher, and the second message was written on the flip side of the first cipher.

Thus, decoding either message would take having all of both messages. It would also require the processing power of a core to sort through possibilities and tease out the two equations.

One message was from Azeria, giving reassurances that they were there to help her and free her. The other message was from Deidre, to verify that she trusted Azeria. But direct words seemed insufficient, and in the end, Deidre decided on an old ballad about a small group of heroes leading a group of mercenaries against the army of an evil king.

She cut off the ballad before the lyrics determined if the mercenary army would prove loyal to their word or try to take advantage of the situation after the victory. Her other self knew the answer in the actual ballad, of course, but that was not the point. Cutting it off there in the message carried a secondary meaning ‚Äî Deidre did not trust their Trionean allies. Mordecai seemed to trust the baron and a few of the soldiers, but he was fairly open about not trusting the rest of the political machinations of the empire.

With the ballad transcribed, there was one scrap of paper left with a blank side. Deidre glanced up at the floating image of all the pieces of this project, and there, too, it was blank. Waiting for her to fill in a name.

""Svetlana,"" she finally said, her voice soft as she spoke the name that had been suppressed for so long. ""The first name I was given, before I met any of the Puritasi, was Svetlana."" It wasn't a name she really associated with herself anymore, but it was better than using the name that the Puritasi had insisted she use.

Deidre refused to even think that name; it was already dead to her, and she knew her core felt the same. The had tried to purge her of her name, just as they had purged any sapient inhabitants she had, lest they try to sneakily work on her behalf for her freedom.

A moment later, the encoded version of her name appeared on the illusion, and she transcribed that encoded version into the final scrap of paper in silence.

It was done.

Deidre felt nervous as this final piece of preparation was completed, and simply watched as Payne collected the last scrap then flitted out to put it in the waiting pouch where the others had all been stored. When everything was done, if it all went according to plan, then her return home was scant weeks away. Payne would be coming with her, the tiny pixie had made that clear long ago, and it had taken Deidre a while to notice that Payne had made herself into Deidre's familiar.

It was an unusual way to acquire a familiar, to have the bond simply form slowly like that, but Deidre did not mind. At least it meant she wouldn't be alone.

There was no one she was looking forward to seeing when she was reunited with her other self. Her sapient and near-sapient inhabitants were in even worse mental shape than she was. Many of them had been people whom she had been forced to take on as inhabitants, and those people had been forced to accept the invitation. Or rather, tortured until they complied.

It was such a convenient way to have someone disappear; they were still alive, so attempts to contact their soul in the afterlife failed, and they were both cloaked by the aura of the nexus itself, as well as their own aura being changed by the process, making them very, very difficult to search for with magic. Much cheaper than capturing their souls and imprisoning them, too.

By the time Mordecai, Kazue, and Moriko were done assisting her core in recovering from what had been done to her, all of her sapient inhabitants were going to be free, whether freed into the world, or, if they were too mad, freed from this cycle of life, so that they might have the chance to reincarnate and begin a fresh life.

Mordecai said he had some ideas on how to help those who would be free, but he needed to verify something before he committed to one of his options.

Dealing with the less self-aware creatures and the automatons was going to be a process of redesign; they were not sentient or sapient enough to be tormented by their existence, but their current designs fulfilled the Puritasi's goals, not hers.

Deidre wondered if it might not be easier if Azeria's plans did not quite succeed. If something happened to her core, and if the unattuned core material that she had been rewarded with could draw her soul here instead of core and avatar both dying, then she could maybe become a subsidiary core.

Of course, no one knew what would happen if she started to reflexively try to claim territory around her new core while already inside of Azeria's territory. A subsidiary core started as either an independent but adjacent nexus, or more rarely, was deliberately developed by the primary core.

Not that Deidre had known this before she'd been told by Mordecai. Yet another thing she had been denied learning about or discovering on her own.

""How long until your other selves arrive?"" She asked as Payne settled onto her shoulder.

Kazue's mental voice answered, ""They seem to be a little more than an hour away.""

Deidre was looking forward to seeing them all again, but the thought brought up even more conflicted feelings. Two sets of desires that were inherently in conflict, and neither was truly possible.

One of them was tied to the idea of becoming their subsidiary core; Deidre did not feel ready to become an independent ruler of a territory again. Most of her existence had been that of a slave, and just being an independent person was a challenging enough prospect at the moment. Who was she to direct others? It would be so much easier to continue to serve, in much the same way that she knew Satsuki wanted to serve, and even becoming a lover to the trio would not be a burden.

To want to continue to be bound by the will of others might seem like a strange thing for a slave to possibly want, but it would be a different sort of servitude, someplace safe where she could explore being an independent person while knowing that there were others who could be responsible and take care of any mistakes she made.

That applied to the other, conflicting desire as well. To become as a daughter to them, the way that Fuyuko and Camilla were. The base impulse was the same: to not be responsible for too much while having the chance to figure out who she was now. It was also the much saner desire. But at the same time, Deidre was already involved with Satsuki, who had previously been Mordecai's lover and who might become consort to the trio in the future. That alone made the idea of having a parent and child sort of relationship awkward, even before considering the issue of how she had met them and become their prisoner.

Her emotions were quite clear to Payne, even if Deidre's exact thoughts did not come across, and the little pixie leaned against Deidre's head. ""Don't worry, you won't be alone. I'll be with you, I promise."" Deidre smiled at that and nuzzled back. It was hard to truly be alone around pixies. When she didn‚Äôt have much to do, sometimes she would play the games that introduced her to this place, just to play with them.

Hmm.

She had an idea.

A brilliant, wonderful, awful, sort of horrifying idea. This place was clearly rubbing off on her.

Deidre held out her hand and said, ""Payne, I have thought of something that might interest you."" While her curious familiar shifted position to land on Deidre's palm, Deidre sent to Kazue, ""Do you mind if I 'steal' a volunteer army of pixies?""

Kazue laughed before answering, ""Deidre, I love the idea, and I will do you one better. Any of our tinier inhabitants who want to move in to help you may join your nexus. We're limiting the size only to make sure it doesn't look like we are invading. Oh, and I have some other ideas now. By the time you leave, you will have all the help and company you need.""

Deidre grinned at Payne. ""So, how would you like the title of Major General? Your job would be to recruit an army, within the bounds that Azeria sets, who want to come north with me and be my personal, permanent honor guard.""

Payne's eyes widened with excitement before she started dancing in place and talking so fast that Deidre couldn't keep up. But she was pretty certain that was a 'yes'.

I didn‚Äôt know how I might feel this week. The levity and absurdity of it all has hit me at weird times. The night before last while folding laundry I was overwhelmed and sat in my tears.

This morning as I drink coffee before getting ready for my first regular 6m post radiation mammo + US, I‚Äôm strangely calm. Today is an anniversary I‚Äôll likely mark for the rest of my life albeit quietly and privately. 

Everything changed that day. And now, 12m later, here I am still very much me yet a new version of me. In many ways I feel more like the core of who I‚Äôve always been deep inside. Perhaps this experience has stripped away the layers of BS that often gradually wraps itself around our lives. 

I do not know what my future holds in relation to cancer. I do know that 1 yr out I‚Äôm really fucking proud of myself. I trust the decisions I‚Äôve made about care and treatment. I‚Äôm here and I‚Äôm strong again. Initially I felt as if my body had betrayed me. Now I know better. My body helped save me. 12m ago I could not have understood this. Time = perspective.

It feels like a weird dream now, it was in February of 24

I had mine done at a high volume center by Dr Eggener, one of the authors of the SEMS study that advocates for the wider use of RPLND as a curative action instead of Chemo or Radio for Good prognosis spread to the lymph nodes.

**Arrival at hospital and pre op**

You get checked in and taken down to the pre-op area where you get set up with various IV's and bloods taken. It seemed to take forever but there was always people coming and going. First a resident would come and go through the consent for the surgery and ""mark"" you. Next the anesthesia resident comes and goes through their consent. Finally the anesthetist comes and does their exam. She was awesome and very comforting and very funny. While she was talking to me, the surgeon came to check everything was good, told my wife to give me a kiss and I suddenly felt..woozy. They give you a quick something to start the ""memory block"" and take away any anxiety. I kind of remember being wheeled down to the OR and climbing onto the table and confirming my name but that's it. It was basically lights out.

**The surgery**

I obviously don't remember any of this - however the open surgery is long and it's amazing that the doctors and nurses and techs can do all this and just go on with their day to day life. They make an incision right the way down from your chest to your belly button. Once that is done, they basically take your bowels out and put them on a sterile sheet on your chest while they go to work. They dig deeper and deeper in to your belly and remove the nodes in the RP. They move super slowly and visually inspect EVERYTHING to make sure there is no spread. I note from my operation notes that the bad nodes were clearly seen.

After about 4 hours, they put your bowels back in ( it all goes back to normal with gravity) and sew you back up. You get bought round from anesthesia very quickly. Apparently I was awake within 10 minutes of leaving the OR and chatting to the nurse and came back to ""consciousness"" about an hour after asking where I was and asking for a coffee.

**In Hospital recovery**

You get taken up to your room and from then it's a waiting game. My surgeon came up AFTER he had done another one of these surgeries to check how I was and got me standing up there and then. The first night was rough but I was on Oxy as well as ""magic button"" that I could press every 10 minutes. They take pain very seriously and want to do everything possible for you not to be in in.

The first night was odd because you are in ""high dependency"" you have nurses coming in every 2 hours for vitals and run meds so you are high as a kite but also can't sleep for long because once you do...in comes the nurse.

From here on out you fall into a routine of trying to walk, poop and sleep. Time stops existing. By day 2 they had taken away the magic button and I was just on oxy as needed and Tylenol. They monitor your urine output to check that everything is OK. By the evening of day 2 my catheter was taken out.

Day 3 I pooped and was more mobile despite being bloated up like a motherfucker. The surgeon came for a final check then asked if I wanted to go home and ""really start recovering"". I went home! (surgery was Tuesday, went home Friday).

**At Home recovery**

You're given a prescription for Oxy to take as needed. 7 tablets initially and you get more if required. I ended up needing 3 in total. For the first week I went from the sofa to bed with periodic walks first up and down my street, then around the block, then around the block twice. Each day getting stronger. Fatigue was real, and there were lots of naps. Eating was fine. I was on 30 day of low fat which was a pain BUT tolerable - it's actually amazing what you can eat on it. By week 3 I was mostly back to normal. Was able to walk into my downtown for a coffee etc. By week 4 I was back at work (desk job)

**Now**

TBH the whole thing seems like a distant dream. After 6 weeks I went back to the gym and within 6 months I ran a 10K. I do have some discomfort with certain foods still and foods that never used to make me feel gassy. After a meal I do get SOME bloating as my food digests but that has lessened a lot over time.

She looked at me the way someone opens a window they haven‚Äôt used in years and finds the room still smells like the same coffee. For a second she smiles, not sad, not happy simply recognizing the shape of what we were.

She breathes, and the memory comes out soft and precise.

It's s bitterness strangely comforting, like the way your presence always steadied me. That sharp taste never pushed me away; it pulled me closer, reminding me of you in the most ordinary yet intimate way.

And then, without a word, she wrapped me tightly. Her chest pressed against mine, as if trying to listen to the storm inside me, to the heart that was ready to burst out of its ribs. In that moment, I felt as though my heartbeat wasn‚Äôt just mine anymore, it was hers too, echoing between us, fragile yet infinite.

‚ÄúWe kept adding small chapters,‚Äù she says. Coffees at midnight because one of us couldn‚Äôt sleep. We argued No, mostly I did. You were the one always apologising, whether it was your mistake or mine. But you never let us go to bed with a heavy heart, you always found a way to soften it, to make sure the night ended lighter than it began. The first time when you talked to me on call till 3 a.m. because I had to submit that damn project the next day, you stayed awake the whole night, singing, cracking jokes, keeping me alive just so I wouldn‚Äôt collapse on the desk. I finished it, but only because you carried me through it. And then we had the quiet things. The way you hummed when you did dishes, the bookmarks you left in books you wanted me to read, Carving out initials on every place we were together.

She pauses, and I can see each scene surface in her eyes. The ordinary becomes luminous under her telling: a shelf where we kept two mugs, a scarf left on a chair, a song that always starts at the same time on the radio. None of it large or heroic, and all of it the thing that made us real.

‚ÄúYou told me once,‚Äù she says, ‚Äúthat to love is to keep someone‚Äôs ordinary safe. You were gentle with me in ways you didn‚Äôt know were brave.‚Äù She squeezes my hand and the pressure says thank you in a language we made for ourselves.

I added my own lines because this is our story, not just a one-page memory. I told her about the morning I thought I‚Äôd been dull, and she said I was precise. I tell her about the night I learned the map of her face by heart where her laugh goes, where her incredulous silence sits. She listens as if she‚Äôs learning that map again, not to return to, but to place somewhere safe.

We speak of the bends too: the nights we nearly lost each other, the words that cut, the afternoons of distance that felt like small absences at first and then like entire continents. She doesn‚Äôt dwell on blame. There‚Äôs no need. We both know how much of abandonment is the slow erosion of everyday things of unfinished sentences, of promises softened by practicality, of small kindnesses expected but sometimes forgotten.

‚ÄúWas it always going to end?‚Äù i asked quietly, and it‚Äôs not a question for anger. It‚Äôs the kind of question that wants a fact, not an argument.

‚ÄúMaybe,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúMaybe some things are meant to be beautiful and brief like a comet across the sky. They don‚Äôt last forever because they are not supposed to. They are bright, and their brightness changes you.‚Äù

She smiles again, a little sadly. ‚ÄúWhen we were in the park,‚Äù she continued, ‚Äúyou picked up a leaf and said it would look good pressed between the pages of a book. You promised to make things last that way to preserve them. You did preserve them. In your way. You wrote them down. You kept them. You loved them. Even now, even now you keep them.‚Äù

The air around us is a soft witness: not cold, not warm, just enough to know we are still here. People pass; their lives unspool in a way that somehow keeps respectful distance from ours. We are a small, charged island in the middle of a flowing river.

She reaches up and brushes my cheek with the back of her fingers an old familiar motion. ‚ÄúThank you for keeping me,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThank you for telling me those things.‚Äù

I want to hand her the whole sky. Instead I press my forehead to hers, because our foreheads remember the balance of each other like two parts of a music that used to fit. ‚ÄúTell me one last line,‚Äù I say. ‚ÄúTell me the part you would like to hold if you ever needed to remember us kindly.‚Äù

She closes her eyes and lifts her face toward mine like someone choosing a word to carve on a boat. ‚ÄúRemember,‚Äù she says slowly, ‚Äúthat we were gentle. That we tried. That we found small, beautiful things in the middle of ordinary days. That we mattered to each other when being mattered was all we wanted.‚Äù

We sit with that line between us until the moment loosens like a thread. Her hand slips slowly from mine; not because she is cold, but because this is how endings hold some dignity. We do not say the things that would make it harder. No promises. No pleas. Just a quiet, mutual understanding that some stories carry their own shape and do not need to be forced into another form.

She turns away at last. I watch her walk, and the world keeps being ordinary

The lights flicker, a dog barks, the street smells like fried onions and wet pavement. Nothing about the city seems to change. But inside me there is a pocket of clarity: our story is now something I can hold entirely on paper and in memory, without needing it to be anything more.

Later, when the house is empty and I make tea with hands that have known hers, I find myself smiling at the memory. Not because I am happy or because I am healed

not yet

but because she told the story the way it deserved to be told. It belongs to both of us now, complete and true.

And when I close the door, I do it gently, like closing a book that I will read again someday not to reopen old wounds, but to remember the shape of pages that taught me how to love.",2,1758193171.0,WritersSanctuary,0,1.0,False

There he was, lounging in a VIP booth with two cocktail waitresses hanging on his every word.



One of his friends spotted me and smirked. ""Hey Johnny, isn't that the cheap fling you used to keep around?""



Johnny's eyes narrowed. He waved me over.



""You're pathetic, Neena,"" he said coldly. ""You told me you were working here to pay my medical bills. What's your excuse now?""



My fists clenched. I turned to walk away.



He stopped me, gesturing toward the glittering rows of liquor behind the bar.



""You love money so much? Here's your chance. Drink until I say stop, and I'll give you ten grand.""



Humiliation burned in my throat, but I nodded. Bottle after bottle, I drank.



My little sister Lily was counting on me. She needed surgery‚Äîand soon.



And me? I had stomach cancer. I wasn't long for this world anyway.



If money could save her, I'd drink myself to death right here.



Two shots of whiskey in, my stomach twisted violently. I dropped the glass, choking, vomiting right there on the floor.



""Ugh, disgusting,"" muttered Ethan, Johnny's friend. ""Just give her a few hundred and let her go, man.""



Johnny's expression darkened. He threw a wad of cash at my feet. ""Get out of here. Don't come back.""



I wiped my mouth, picked up the money, and stuffed it into my pocket. Then I looked him in the eye.



""I can keep going, Mr. Sullivan.""



I reached for another row of bottles and forced myself to drink‚Äîmechanical, numb.



When I finished the last one, Johnny finally snapped.



He cursed, kicked the bottle out of my hand, and grabbed me by the collar.



""Are you really this desperate, Neena? Is money worth this much?""



I pushed back, forcing a smile. ""Are you satisfied now, Mr. Sullivan? That'll be ten thousand.""



His jaw tightened. Anger flashed in his eyes.



Then he laughed‚Äîa cold, hollow sound. ""You want money? Fine.""



He nodded toward someone, and a metal cash box appeared.



""Get on your knees. Pick up every bill with your mouth. Do it, and I'll give you fifteen thousand more.""



A shower of money fluttered down around me.



I didn't hesitate. I dropped to my knees.



Laughter and taunts echoed around us, but I blocked it all out. My eyes stayed on the bills.



With enough money, Lily would live. Dignity was a luxury I couldn't afford.



I was almost done when Johnny stepped on the last bill.



I tried again and again, but I couldn't get it.



""Mr. Sullivan,"" I whispered, ""please move your foot.""



He smirked, lifted his shoe, and then pressed it against my cheek.



I struggled, but he held me down. Tears finally spilled over.



""Lick it clean,"" he said, his voice low and cruel. ""Then the money is yours.""



I dug my nails into my palms until I bled, but I felt nothing. I closed my eyes and did what he asked.



When it was over, I picked up the last bill, leaned against the sofa, and held out my hand. ""Fifteen thousand.""



""You're unbelievable."" He looked away in disgust, slammed the cash box shut, and threw it toward me. ""Get out of my sight.""



Then he was gone.



The crowd lost interest and drifted away.



I coughed violently‚Äîa metallic taste filled my mouth. Blood.



Wanda, the manager, rushed over, her eyes red-rimmed. ""Neena, why are you doing this? Just tell him the truth! He could help you!""



She was the only one who knew everything‚Äîabout Johnny, about me.



""Don't,"" I said, shaking my head. ""Please.""



She sighed and helped me to the break room. I lay on the couch, my mind drifting.



I'd taken Johnny in once, but I always felt like I owed him more.



Three years ago, on a stormy night, I found him outside the hospital‚Äîsoaking wet, broke, and sick. He said he had kidney failure and nowhere to go.



Maybe it was because I'd lost both my parents to kidney disease. Something in me broke. I took him in. Promised I'd help him.



I worked nonstop to support us‚Äîme, my sister Lily, and Johnny.



When he got better, he took a dangerous job to help with money. Then came the accident‚Äîa falling beam, a head injury. Doctors said he was lucky to be alive.



But he never fully recovered. He was in and out of the hospital, weak, in pain.



Then Lily got diagnosed. Hereditary nephritis. Like our parents.



I gave her one of my kidneys.



The day of my surgery, Johnny took a turn for the worse. He begged me to save him too.



I couldn't. I tried to explain, but he didn't believe me. He thought I chose Lily over him.



He broke up with me and left the hospital. The next thing I heard‚Äîhe was dead.



I didn't have time to grieve. Lily was still sick. I went back to work before I was healed, taking any job I could find. My health crumbled. The stress, the irregular meals‚Äîit all turned into cancer.



And now‚Ä¶ Johnny was back. Alive. Well.



Maybe it was better this way. We were from different worlds. He could move on.



And I could finally let go.







Chapter 2





Feeling a bit stronger, I made my way back to my apartment.



I took some meds, washed the blood off, and headed straight to the hospital to check on Lily.



But that little girl is sharp. The moment I walked into her room, she took one look at my pale face and started begging to stop her own treatment so she could take care of me instead.



I forced a smile and reassured her, ""Your big sister is tough as nails‚ÄîI don't go down that easy. Your only job is to focus on getting better. Don't you worry about me.""



After I finally got Lily to sleep, I slipped out of the room.



Dr. Brown was waiting for me in the hall. He gave me a sympathetic look. ""Ms. Grey, your body is under extreme stress. You really have to stop drinking. If you keep this up‚Ä¶ you might not make it to the end of the month.""



Today was Valentine's Day‚ÄîFebruary 14th. That meant I had fifteen days left.



I had to work fast. I needed to get the rest of Lily's surgery money, and fast‚Ä¶



I smiled bitterly, pulling out the $25,000 from my pocket and handing it to Dr. Brown. ""Please, use this for my sister's care. I'll get the rest of the money for her operation. I promise.""



Dr. Brown looked down at the cash, then stopped me as I turned to leave. ""Ms. Grey‚Ä¶ this is enough to begin your own chemotherapy. We could start‚Äî""



""No,"" I cut him off, shaking my head gently. ""It's too late for me. All I want now is for Lily to get better.""



I left the hospital, stopped at a convenience store, and chugged two large black coffees.



Then I hopped on my electric scooter and started my delivery shift.



Luck was on my side tonight‚Äîright after I went online, I landed a huge order with a thousand-dollar tip.



I picked up the delivery‚Äîan expensive-looking black swan cake‚Äîand followed my GPS to an upscale neighborhood.



The security guard checked with the homeowner and waved me through.



Luxury cars lined the streets. My beat-up scooter looked pretty pathetic next to them.



I found the address, put on my professional smile, and knocked.



The door swung open‚Äîand my heart dropped.



Ethan was leaning against the doorframe. He let out a low whistle. ""Well, well. If it isn't Johnny's little gold-digger? You actually tracked him down here? Since you came all this way‚Ä¶ come on in. Have a drink.""



Before I could say a word, he yanked me inside. The cake box slipped from my hands and hit the floor.



The whole room went quiet.



Johnny was sitting on the couch, a frown darkening his face. The gorgeous woman in his lap instantly scowled.



""Johnny,"" she whined, ""is this the girl you faked your death to get away from? Is she here to make trouble? She already scammed you out of twenty grand at the club tonight, and now she ruined the cake you bought me! That was expensive!""



Ethan grinned, grabbed a full bottle of liquor, and shoved it toward me. ""Easy fix. Drink this, and I'll cover the $3,800 cake.""



Just then, Wanda‚Äîwho was there delivering drinks‚Äîrushed over. Her face went pale when she saw what was happening.



She snatched the bottle out of my hands and turned desperately to Johnny. ""Mr. Sullivan, you can't! Neena has late-stage stomach cancer‚Äîshe only has one kidney! She can't drink! It could kill her!""



Ethan laughed coldly. ""Convenient. You expect us to believe that? Trying to guilt-trip Johnny now?""



When Johnny's eyes stayed locked on me, Ethan smirked. ""Whoa, Johnny‚Ä¶ don't tell me you actually fell for‚Äî""



""Bullshit! I'd never fall for her!"" Johnny snapped, jumping up like he'd been burned. ""Neena, take a look in the mirror. You're a lying con artist. You're not worth my attention.""



He grabbed a vacuum cleaner, smashed it into the cake on the floor, and pointed at the messy swirl.



""Lick it clean,"" he said, voice cold. ""Do it, and I'll give you a million dollars.""



I just looked at him‚Äîarrogant, cruel, so full of pride. A deep sadness washed over me.



There was a time he would've protected me.



Now, all he wanted was to humiliate me.



For a second, I thought I saw something flicker in his eyes‚Äîdoubt, maybe even regret.



But it vanished as he leaned against the shoe cabinet, lit a cigarette, and said, ""Ethan, record this.""



""With pleasure!""



Ethan hurried off to grab his phone.



I knew there was no way out.



I didn't have $3,800. So I took a breath, closed my eyes, got down on my knees, and started licking the cake off the floor.



I could feel Johnny's amusement slowly turning into something darker‚Äîsomething like rage.



When I finally stood up and held out my hand, he scribbled out a check and slapped it against my face.



""Here's your million. Now get out of my sight. Forever.""







Chapter 3





After devouring that entire cake, my stomach rebelled violently, sending me tumbling off my scooter. My forehead slammed against a roadside stone, filling my mouth with the metallic tang of blood. But I felt nothing‚Äîjust a numb puppet picking myself up and climbing back on, riding home in a daze.



A million dollars. That would cover Lily's transplant and give her the post-op care she deserved. My duty was finally done. I could rest.



I woke to my phone buzzing incessantly. Disoriented, I answered‚Äîand shot straight out of bed.



""Dr. Brown, what did you say? Lily's condition is worse?""



My heart leapt into my throat. My vision started to blur. But then his next words pulled me back from the edge.



""A donor‚Ä¶ we found one. And the money's here. The surgery can happen‚ÄîI'm on my way!""



Still in my cake-smeared delivery uniform, I didn't bother changing. I snatched the check and bolted to the hospital.



""Dr. Brown‚Äîthis check is for a million dollars. Please, just do the surgery!""



He looked at me, sympathetic but firm. ""Ms. Grey, I know you're anxious, but the hospital doesn't accept checks. Go get the cash. We'll start pre-op right away.""



""I'll go now!""



I raced to the bank, my heart still pounding. The thought of Lily finally living a normal life brought tears to my eyes.



Phone pressed to my ear, I rushed up to the counter. ""Dr. Brown, I'm here‚Äîget everything ready, I'm sending the money‚Äî""



The teller took the check, slid it into a machine, and‚Äîshredded it.



""What are you doing?!""



Thunder roared in my head. My temples pulsed.



""I'm sorry,"" she said flatly. ""We have orders from above to destroy this check immediately.""



Before I could process it, chaos erupted through the phone.



""Code blue! Emergency room‚Äînow!""

Wish we never worked together. Wish I never went back to your place after drinking with everyone. I look back at who I was when I was with you and it still feels like I was living in some hellish fever dream. I felt like I was losing my mind, and really, I suppose I was.

You told me I was the one. You told me I was selfish and couldn't be trusted. You said I was the smartest person you knew. You smashed bottles on the ground and flipped furniture in front of me. You asked me to move in with you. You woke me up in the middle of the night so you could argue with me. You made me coffee just the way I liked. You threw all my clothes out the 2nd story window of the room we shared. You let me into your inner world. You threatened me with a kitchen knife. You cried and told me you didn't know why you were that way and that you needed help. You threatened your own life. You tried to recover from alcoholism. You hurt the dogs we adopted together. You wanted to take me on a trip for my birthday. You set your car on fire to teach me a lesson. 

The ends of my sanity were frayed and ragged.  My reality was some sick funhouse. My heart and mind and soul had a taint that didnt exist before you. I lost my job, the one where we met, because I had a no call no show. I never told them it was because you were threatening to kill yourself and I was terrified and desperately trying to help and be present. I told our friends you threatened suicide and harm, and I begged them for help. They only stepped in once, and I didn't know where to turn for help. You went to the hospital with a .26 BAC and were admitted to the psych ward. I cried when I visited to find youphyaucally trembling as you told me you hated me for putting you in there.  Leaving was the best thing I could have done, and I'm grateful to myself for taking that terrifying step. I couch surfed and lived in a car for a month after I left because I didnt have a place lined up and didn't have the money to put a deposit down. Truly, you pulled me down to rock bottom.

It's been 8 years. I still struggle to talk about what you put me through. I struggle even more to talk about who I was when I was with you. Because that person feels like a stranger. Her mind was not the same as my mind. Her heart was not the same as my heart. 

I know you've searched my name over the years.I know on some level I'm still in your crosshair. I know I can't add mutual friends on social media in case anything about me gets back to you. I have a background check site that keeps tabs on any changes to your addresses, so I know where to avoid. I'm not registered to vote because in my state, registered voters' home addresses are publicly available on the voter registration site and I simply can't risk having my address out there for you to find. 

I've only just put myself back into the dating scene. It's hard to try to let anyone in. I know if someone gets that far, eventually I will have to talk about you. About why my heart is so guarded. About why I struggle to trust others. About why I struggle to trust myself. 

Today I write this to put these thoughts and feelings out into the world. I hope you heal. I hope you never attempt to reach out to me. I hope I can heal and let someone else in someday. I hope this post makes someone in the world feel a little less alone in their situation. I hope this post gives someone the courage to leave if they're beaten down but unsure of where to go. I hope this post sheds some light on why it's hard to leave toxic relationships or why someone might stay with a partner who is ""obviously"" bad for them, because really it's not always obvious until it's too late.

1nk4zp5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreatorServices/comments/1nk4zp5/you_dont_always_have_to_follow_the_most_popular/,you don't always have to follow the most popular advice for content creation,"You start creating for youtube... you look at how to videos.. you look at top creators' workflows.. they all recommend the same standard workflow more or less in the ballpark of ideate > script > edit > post... but it doesn't always work... it doesn't always bring out your best videos  
  
UNDERSTAND THIS: Creating videos - at all stages - is a creative job. Rigid structure like that is opposite to the very nature of free flowing creativity  
  
Those workflows you see are from creators with matured creation processes i.e. they have been doing it for years.

But your topic may be different

How you write may be different

And, most of all, your brain will work differently

The process has to work for you.

I am an Organic Visibility Consultant and a Content Creator with a solid track record in SEO Strategy and Organic Growth via Content (check me out on LinkedIn and my website). I am also a YouTube fanatic. On a free day, I watch anywhere between 8-14 hours of youtube. I also have diagnosed Adult ADHD and focusing on routine is very hard for me. I still somehow have survived to be 35 :P

I've never lived by the norm. I've never liked following the book of instructions for anything. I aim for innovation and flexibility all the time - My main content lives on LinkedIn and even there I am not ""consistent"" as how popular media might define consistency. But I do keep producing carousels regularly and now I am close to my 5K follower mark. 

  
Here's a general workflow I'd use if I had the bandwidth for YouTube content creation 

= Develop a regular notepad to write my insights about my chosen niche. IT HAS TO BE ON YOUR SMARTPHONE. Because creativity doesn't follow a clock. I can capture what comes to my mind when I am having coffee, sometimes when I am buying my groceries, or when I am doing my business in the morning. Unshackle your brain, see the ideas flow  
  
= Follow content creators whose niche I have no active interest in doing anything in. I already do this with with astronomy, paleo biology and zoology (dinosaurs), and even Golden Girls and Architectural Digest clips. It's not meant to actively generate ideas but their content style is meant to give me material that helps me capture my ideas more accurately and directly. plus consumption for fun is ... just fun!

1nk4xgu,https://www.reddit.com/r/MarketingHelp/comments/1nk4xgu/you_dont_always_have_to_follow_the_most_popular/,you don't always have to follow the most popular advice,"You start creating for youtube... you look at how to videos.. you look at top creators' workflows.. they all recommend the same standard workflow more or less in the ballpark of ideate > script > edit > post... but it doesn't always work... it doesn't always bring out your best videos  
  
UNDERSTAND THIS: Creating videos - at all stages - is a creative job. Rigid structure like that is opposite to the very nature of free flowing creativity  
  
Those workflows you see are from creators with matured creation processes i.e. they have been doing it for years.

But your topic may be different

How you write may be different

And, most of all, your brain will work differently

The process has to work for you.

I am an Organic Visibility Consultant and a Content Creator with a solid track record in SEO Strategy and Organic Growth via Content (check me out on LinkedIn and my website). I am also a YouTube fanatic. On a free day, I watch anywhere between 8-14 hours of youtube. I also have diagnosed Adult ADHD and focusing on routine is very hard for me. I still somehow have survived to be 35 :P

I've never lived by the norm. I've never liked following the book of instructions for anything. I aim for innovation and flexibility all the time - My main content lives on LinkedIn and even there I am not ""consistent"" as how popular media might define consistency. But I do keep producing carousels regularly and now I am close to my 5K follower mark. 

  
Here's a general workflow I'd use if I had the bandwidth for YouTube content creation 

= Develop a regular notepad to write my insights about my chosen niche. IT HAS TO BE ON YOUR SMARTPHONE. Because creativity doesn't follow a clock. I can capture what comes to my mind when I am having coffee, sometimes when I am buying my groceries, or when I am doing my business in the morning. Unshackle your brain, see the ideas flow  
  
= Follow content creators whose niche I have no active interest in doing anything in. I already do this with with astronomy, paleo biology and zoology (dinosaurs), and even Golden Girls and Architectural Digest clips. It's not meant to actively generate ideas but their content style is meant to give me material that helps me capture my ideas more accurately and directly. plus consumption for fun is ... just fun!   


= Follow content creators in my niche from a distance, think about what they posted and why they posted before jumping on the trend bandwagon. Also, I'd appreciate them publicly and build positive relationships that ignite reciprocity for all of us.

= Separate idea generation from video creation. Only proceed an idea to video creation when I am confident I am ready to deliver it.

1nk4x9x,https://i.redd.it/f35a7r0nkwpf1.jpeg,Panel to Panel: Comics I Can‚Äôt Shut Up About ‚Äì G.I.L.T,"Welcome back to Panel to Panel: Comics I Can‚Äôt Shut Up About, my weekly excuse to gush and ramble about the comics currently living rent-free in my brain.

Every week, I pull a title off my shelf that‚Äôs grabbed me by the heart, the funny bone, or sometimes just the sheer audacity of its premise, and I share it here with you.

This isn‚Äôt about reviews or star ratings; it‚Äôs about enthusiasm.

Think of it like we‚Äôve just sat down with a stack of comics and a pot of coffee, and I can‚Äôt stop waving one in your face, saying, ‚ÄúNo, seriously, you have to read this.‚Äù

From indie gems to cult favourites to the occasionally obvious pick, these are the stories that make me fall in love with comics all over again, and hopefully, they‚Äôll spark the same joy for you, too.

Every now and then, a comic lands in your hands that feels like it was written to be read with a glass of wine in one hand and a raised eyebrow in the other.

G.I.L.T. is one of those comics.

It‚Äôs witty, stylish, unapologetically clever, and just a little messy in all the best ways.

At its centre is Hildy Winters, a sharp-tongued, fiercely independent New Yorker who has managed to do something most of us only daydream about while stuck in traffic: she‚Äôs found herself a time-travel portal.

But Hildy isn‚Äôt just dabbling in temporal tourism for kicks; she‚Äôs part of the Guild of Independent Lady Temporalists (or G.I.L.T. for short), a secret society whose first rule is ‚Äúdon‚Äôt mess with the past without co-op board approval.‚Äù

This is a comic that doesn‚Äôt so much bend genres as it does lounge across them in sequins, daring you not to stare.

Imagine Golden Girls meets Doctor Who with just enough Sex and the City sass to make you smirk, and you‚Äôre getting close.

But what makes G.I.L.T. truly stand out isn‚Äôt its premise; it‚Äôs the heart beating underneath the humour.

Writer Alisa Kwitney and artist Mauricet aren‚Äôt interested in superheroes punching holes through timelines.

Instead, they give us women who feel lived-in, worry about their choices in their 20s, wonder what they might have done differently, and still manage to be utterly relatable in all their flaws and quirks.

It‚Äôs about regret, yes, but also about resilience, friendship, and finding joy in the absurdity of life.

The book swings effortlessly from the chaotic energy of 1970s New York to the quieter corners of modern apartments, and every panel feels like it belongs exactly where it is.

You can almost smell the cigarette smoke, and you‚Äôll want to linger in every background detail.

What I love most about G.I.L.T. is how it shows that sometimes the most magical story is about two women navigating life, time, and their own complicated histories, all while cracking wise and refusing to fade quietly into the background.

So if you‚Äôre in the mood for something bold, clever, and just a little bit glamorous, G.I.L.T. is waiting.

Pick it up, pour yourself a drink, and let Hildy and Trista take you somewhere you didn‚Äôt realise you wanted to go.



That‚Äôs it for this week‚Äôs Panel to Panel: Comics I Can‚Äôt Shut Up About.

G.I.L.T. is proof that comics can be glamorous, hilarious, and heartfelt all at once.

If you pick it up, I‚Äôd love to know your thoughts, because some stories beg to be shared.

Until next week, keep turning those pages and discovering the magic tucked between the panels.

LOL","Heh, didn't expect the love on that last post üòÇ Maybe we should rename our company to¬†*Funny Garage Moments*¬†at this point... cause boy, do we have stories.

.......

Alright, so picture this. It's a standard Tuesday morning, sun's out, cruising in the truck with my coffee. Get a call from a super nice lady in Sherman Oaks, sounds a little frantic. Her garage door is making a noise that, and I quote, ""sounds like a demon trying to eat a bag of forks.""

I'm like, ""Alright, bet. I'm on my way."" Figure it's a classic case of a worn-out roller or maybe the spring's singing its swan song.

I get there, and the door is just... shuddering. Like it's trying to open but it's got the cold shakes. I hit the button, and it goes up about six inches and just stops dead.¬†*Grind grind grind.*¬†**Nope.**

So I do the tech thing, manually disengage it to take a look. I tell the homeowner, ""Stand back, just in case this thing is feeling extra spicy today."" I get the door up, and I'm underneath, checking out the motor and the tracks.

And that's when I hear it. A tiny, rustling sound. Not metal-on-metal. Something else.

I shine my flashlight up into the header space above the door, right where the torsion spring is...

And I'm staring face-to-face with the biggest, fluffiest, most judgmental raccoon I have ever seen in my life. üòÇ This dude had built himself a whole nest out of, like, old leaves and what looked like a shredded tennis ball. He just looked at me like¬†*I*¬†was the one breaking into¬†*his*¬†house.

I just started laughing. I couldn't help it.

I back out and the homeowner is like, ""What is it? Is it bad?!""

I'm like, ""Ma'am, the good news is, your spring is fine. The bad news is, you've got a new tenant. And he hasn't paid his rent."" ü§£

Turns out, a little gap in the weather stripping was his front door. The ""demon eating forks"" noise was him scrambling every time the door tried to open and squish his new penthouse suite.

We had to call animal control (that's a different union, man üòâ) to safely encourage our furry friend to vacate the premises. Once he was out, we fixed the seal, cleared out the... uh... ""redecorating,"" and gave the motor a once-over. Good as new.

Moral of the story? Sometimes the weirdest noise isn't a mechanical failure. It's just a trash panda who really appreciates good real estate.

Hope your Tuesday was less weird than mine!

1nk4qqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1nk4qqf/what_are_the_newest_car_windshield_cover_designs/,What are the newest car windshield cover designs?,"Hey Reddit! I've been diving deep into car accessories lately, and I've got to share my recent discoveries about car windshield covers. Trust me, they've come a long way from those basic sun reflectors we used to see everywhere.

I recently bought a new car, and living in an area with pretty extreme weather made me realize how important it is to protect my windshield. After tons of research and trying out different options, I'm amazed at how advanced these covers have become.

First off, the materials are incredible now. Many new designs use this special multi-layer technology that doesn't just block sun ‚Äì they're actually handling everything from snow to bird droppings (yeah, those pesky creatures). I found some great options at https://athometouch.com/car-windshield-cover that really opened my eyes to what's available now.

The magnetic edges are probably my favorite new feature. No more awkward straps or door jammers! These things just snap into place like magic. And get this - some even have built-in theft protection features. Who knew windshield covers could be this sophisticated?

What really blew my mind were the smart covers with frost sensors. They can actually detect when ice is forming and have special coating that makes ice removal super easy. Game changer for winter mornings!

I've also noticed this cool trend of customizable designs. You're not stuck with plain silver anymore. Some companies are offering personalized patterns, and there are even some with reflective artwork that only shows up when light hits it.

The storage solutions have improved too. Most new models fold down into tiny packages that fit in your glove compartment. I remember my old one was like wrestling with a giant bubble wrap!

If you're in the market for a new windshield cover, definitely check out the selection at https://athometouch.com/car-windshield-cover. The prices are pretty reasonable considering how much technology they pack in these days.

One tip though - make sure to measure your windshield before buying. These new designs are much more size-specific than the old universal fits.

Anyone else tried these newer models? I'd love to hear your experiences with them. The way they're evolving, I wouldn't be surprised if next year's models come with built-in coffee makers or something!",1,1758191772.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

1nk4pfj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1nk4pfj/budget_grinder_from_aliexpress_for_aeropress/,Budget grinder from AliExpress for Aeropress?,"Hello!

I am new to coffee making and really liked what Aeropress offers, so I ordered it.

But now I need coffee grinder that would last me as long as the Aeropress itself. 

To be honest, I am not that demanding, and I don‚Äôt want to pay hundreds of dollars for a perfect grinder, but I don‚Äôt want to cheap out and buy something that would produce bad results.

Locally, grinders are expensive. So I found out that many recommended options have official stores on AliExpress! But there are too many options.

After reading this subreddit for a while, I narrowed down my options to:
- Kingrinder P0 or P2 (around $25-$30; P1 is usually not in stock, so I don‚Äôt consider it)
- Timemore C3S Pro ($37)
- Timemore C3ESP ($40) - some people who bought C3S Pro thought they were buying C3ESP, so they wanted this model specifically for some reason
- iCafilas grinder (TURIN 40) ($18) - very affordable, but way fewer reviews and some people report small issues with it, but nothing critical 

I guess, Kingrinder K1 is also an option, but those above are my main variants. 

Can you please recommend which one I should get?

I want a reliable tool for many years without bothering with maintenance, and for Aeropress only. I don‚Äôt see myself buying something else, at least, for now.

As for the coffee I am gonna brew, if that matters - probably something light to medium roasted from local roasters.

Thanks!

""Dominic, you betrayed me."" When I walked in on my husband kissing another woman in that hotel suite, my world collapsed in an instant.  
He had once been my most trusted partner, but now he had become nothing more than a betrayer.  
And I‚ÄîI would use my sharpest weapons to reclaim my dignity and my life.  
‚Ä¶‚Ä¶  
Manhattan under the night sky remained brilliantly lit, with streams of traffic on both sides of the streets flowing like flickering ribbons of light into countless people's stories.  
I sat in my study, staring at the documents in my hand, but my eyes couldn't focus.  
The phone on the corner of my desk lit up, and a notification popped up on the screen‚Äîa text message reminder from my husband Dominic.  
We'd been married for five years, and had never set passwords on our phones.  
But just last month, he suddenly changed his lock screen and message permissions.  
When I reached for his phone, he smiled and said, ""There's some sensitive client information from work. Can't just unlock it casually.""  
I didn't press further.  
But a woman's intuition is like an invisible hand that grips your heart tight.  
Dominic had been coming home late more and more recently.  
It was always ""working late"" or ""last-minute business cocktails.""  
In his closet appeared a suit jacket I didn't recognize, carrying an unfamiliar fragrance.  
I had carefully asked him once: ""Did you change your cologne?""  
He paused for a moment, then smiled naturally: ""A gift from a business partner on the new project.""  
I forced a smile and nodded, but my heart felt like it had a boulder pressing down on it.  
What made me even more uneasy was that he started frequently turning off his phone's vibration, and even when taking calls at home, he would walk out to the balcony and speak in low voices.  
I tried to convince myself: Don't overthink it.  
He was a man with strong career ambitions‚Äîmaybe he really was just busy with work.  
But that night, when I was organizing clothes, I accidentally saw a hotel receipt stuffed in his shirt pocket, printed with ""Empire State Building Suite‚ÄîDinner for Two.""  
My heart suddenly lurched.  
""Have you been very busy lately?"" I finally spoke up during dinner that evening.  
Dominic looked up, his expression unchanged: ""Yeah, the new project just launched, need to visit more clients.""  
I stared at him‚Äîthat face was still handsome and composed, the reason I had married him without hesitation all those years ago.  
But now, I found myself doubting every word he said.  
""Then why didn't you come home last night?"" My voice was soft, but probing.  
He put down his knife and fork and smiled: ""Company-arranged gathering, had a bit too much to drink, so I rested at the hotel. Don't worry.""  
My hand holding the utensils trembled slightly, and a voice surged in my heart: He's lying.  
But I didn't expose him, just responded lightly: ""Mm, let me know earlier next time.""  
He reached over to cover my hand with his, smiling gently: ""What are you overthinking, Elisa? I've never hidden anything from you.""  
I lowered my head and forcefully cut a piece of steak, every bite I chewed felt like swallowing ice cubes.  
That night, I lay in bed listening to the sound of water from the bathroom.  
My phone was on the nightstand when the screen suddenly lit up.  
I picked it up almost instinctively, only to see a contact name that had been hidden‚Äîshowing only a first initial ""S.""  
The message was short: ""Same place tomorrow?""  
My chest suddenly tightened, and my breathing became rapid.  
But just then, the bathroom door opened, and I frantically put the phone back in place.  
Dominic came out wrapped in a towel, glanced at me, and said with a smile: ""Still not asleep?""  
""Mm, can't sleep."" I forced a smile, but inside my heart, a beast was roaring.  
He walked over and gently kissed my forehead: ""Stop overthinking, okay?""  
I closed my eyes, pretending to be calm, but tears still slipped out quietly.  
The next day, I met my good friend Catherine for coffee.  
She was the kind of woman with sharp eyes who could see through worldly affairs.  
""Are you sure he's got a problem?"" she asked.  
""I can't be sure."" I stared at the latte in my hands, my voice trembling. ""But I feel like he's different from before. There's something unfamiliar about him.""  
Catherine was silent for a moment, then suddenly sneered: ""Elisa, you know what? Men's lies usually aren't in their words, but in the details. The more naturally they act, the more careful you should be.""  
I looked up at the bustling crowd outside the window.  
Neon lights reflected on the glass, making my reflection blurry and unclear.  
Catherine had cruelly torn away the facade I was desperately trying to maintain, making me clearly realize that my marriage was standing on the edge of collapse.  
New York's winter night was particularly cold, the wind cutting across my face like a blade.  
I wrapped my coat tighter around me, clutching my coffee as I emerged from the conference center.  
Originally, my colleagues and I had planned a last-minute dinner gathering, but it ended early when the client canceled.  
I stood hesitant in the crowd for a moment, but instead of going straight home, I turned into a taxi at the corner.  
""Empire State Building Hotel."" As I gave the address, my heart suddenly clenched tight.  
This was instinct driving me.  
Last night I had found that receipt, with this hotel's name boldly printed on it.  
When the car stopped at the hotel entrance, I was almost frozen in my seat.  
The entrance was brilliantly lit with guests streaming in and out. I suddenly felt cowardly.  
Should I just leave and pretend I never saw anything?  
But the text notification with that letter ""S"" kept flashing through my mind.  
I got out of the car and forced myself to walk into the lobby.  
The lobby manager approached with a smile: ""Good evening, do you need assistance?""  
I took a deep breath, forcing myself to stay calm: ""I'm looking for my husband, Dominic Collins. He booked a suite here.""  
The manager paused, his eyes flickering, then nodded: ""Mr. Collins just went upstairs.""  
My heart suddenly sank as I walked toward the elevator.  
The elevator rose slowly while my heartbeat thundered like drums.  
My fingertips dug into the keycard in my hand, my palm slick with cold sweat.  
The elevator stopped on the 25th floor, my heartbeat nearly bursting from my chest.  
The hallway was quiet, filled only with the muffled sound of my heels on the carpet.  
Outside the room door, I heard muffled laughter.  
A woman's laughter.  
Soft, with a flirtatious lilt at the end.  
My fingers trembling, I pushed open the door.  
‚ÄîThe scene before me brutally shattered my sanity.  
The suite's floor-to-ceiling windows were open, night and neon mixing together, ambiguous lighting spilling across the sofa.  
Dominic sat there, his shirt half-open, collar disheveled, sleeves rolled up to his elbows, revealing arms I knew intimately.  
And Amelia was straddling his lap, holding a glass of red wine, a few drops spilling out and sliding down Dominic's chest.  
She tilted her head back, smiling as she used her tongue to lick away the wine stain by his collarbone, the gesture so intimate it nearly suffocated me.  
Dominic didn't push her away. Instead, he lifted his hand to grip her waist, holding her firmly in his embrace.  
""You've had too much to drink,"" his voice was low and husky.  
""Then you should take care of me,"" Amelia laughed coquettishly, her fingers trailing down his chest, stopping at his belt buckle.  
My brain exploded with a roar, blood rushing to my ears, nearly drowning me.  
""Dominic!"" My voice was hoarse.  
Both of them froze instantly.  
Amelia was stunned for a second, then quickly lowered her head as if just realizing my presence.  
Dominic's face turned deathly pale, like someone caught red-handed with a secret.  
He instinctively pushed her away, standing up in panic: ""Elisa, how did you get here?""  
I stared at him intently, tears blurring my vision: ""I want to ask you the same thing‚Äîwhat are you doing here?""  
The room reeked of mixed perfume and alcohol, flowing into my lungs like poison gas, nearly suffocating me.  
Amelia quickly adjusted her expression, her voice trembling: ""You've misunderstood, Elisa. I was just... a little drunk, and Dominic was kindly taking care of me.""  
""Taking care?"" I laughed coldly, pointing straight at the sofa. ""Straddling him? Licking wine off his body? That's what you call taking care?""  
The air froze.  
Dominic rushed over, reaching out to grab my hand: ""It's not what you think! She really had too much to drink, I was just‚Äî""  
I violently shook off his hand, my gaze sharp as a blade: ""Dominic, do you think I'm too stupid to see what's right in front of me?""  
Silence.  
Suffocating silence.  
He looked panicked, opening his mouth but unable to form a complete explanation.  
Tears welled up in Amelia's eyes, looking pitiful: ""I'm sorry, I never meant to ruin your relationship. It's just... I really can't live without Dominic.""  
Her words were like a knife, cutting deep into my heart.  
I turned around, my voice cold as ice: ""Enjoy yourselves, you two.""  
I slammed the door behind me, the crash echoing through the hallway.  
I stumbled forward, each step feeling like walking on sharp glass shards, pain tearing through flesh and blood.  
Behind me, Dominic's urgent voice called out: ""Elisa! Let me explain!""  
But I didn't look back.  
Tears blurred my vision, but they also washed away my last illusion.  
From this moment on, I knew: this marriage had reached its end.",3,1758191585.0,romancenovels,3,1.0,False

I didn't know how else to word the title but I'm looking for a best friend who's also kind of clingy and doesn't mind endlessly chatting away or pestering each other all day ü§≠. I miss the closeness/clingyness of a relationship and I'm hoping to capture some of that in friend form with you! Something deeply connected and genuine. Live, love, laugh, toaster bath ü§ó.

It would be great to meet people locally. As much as I would love to be pen pals, I'd prefer to move things offline eventually and start spending time IRL. Not opposed to finding friends from around the world though!

I'm like an onion. Peel back the layers to find out what's underneath. Try not to cry while you do it. I like my humour how I like my coffee, dark.

I'm working night shift tonight and things are a little bit quiet so I'll be around for a while to chat! Feel free to join me and throw some music recommendations my way.

A little info about me so you know I'm not just a blank slate ready to get smashed to death by the hammer of life:

[Pictures](https://imgur.com/a/ieaaG0K)

* I'm British so get used to sarcasm sprinkled with lots of dark humour.
* Big Heavy Metal fan. Recent attendee of Bloodstock 2025. Deathcore is where it is at for me but I do have a big playlist of guilty pleasures from all kinds of genres. Can't beat some 80s pop now and then.
* Gym rat in the making. I thought it was about time I started taking care of myself a little better. I'm actually taking this somewhat seriously.
* Very much interested in physics/astronomy/cosmology. It hurts my brain at times but it's fun learning how things work on a deeper level. I'm always up for chatting about any new developments or theories.
* I play video games but not as much as I used to. I'm mostly playing OldSchool RuneScape, Satisfactory and Modded Minecraft at the moment.
* I enjoy having deep thought provoking conversations that tickle the brain, no matter how silly the subject.
* Anime is a favourite of mine although I haven't watched anything new for a while. The last things I watched were AOT, Dragonball Super and One Punch Man. I've been meaning to start One Piece.
* I do like to play a good board game. My recent favourites have been Terraforming Mars, Scythe and Wingspan. I've been on the lookout for a D&D group for years.
* Some other things I like to do are hiking, cycling, swimming and exploring.
* I'm hoping to try rock climbing or bouldering soon. I've also got driving lessons to start.

What I'm looking for in you:

* Age 21-40 - Not opposed to people outside this range but Ideally I'm looking for people around my age
* We don't need 100% compatibility on hobbies/likes, just show interest.
* Timezones don't matter. I work a crazy schedule
* Wanting to be supportive of each other and push each other
* Can hold a conversation and willing to put the effort in.
* Silly/chaotic vibes preferred

1nk4n36,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nk4n36/struggling_to_dial_in_new_grinder_eureka_single/,Struggling to dial in new grinder [Eureka Single Dose],"I recently upgraded from Baratza Encore ESP to Eureka Single Dose, but now I am struggling to dial in. I haven‚Äôt really seasoned the burrs because I don‚Äôt like wasting coffee and I also don‚Äôt like the idea of cheap supermarket coffee getting retained in the grinder and later exchanged into my freshly roasted beans. 

I was somewhat happy with the taste of my flat whites from ESP, but I did feel like I could make it even better, hence why I upgraded to Eureka. However none of the shots from Eureka were as good as ESP. I don‚Äôt question the quality of the grinder and burrs, I know it‚Äôs capable of producing better espresso when dialed in and I did notice much better extraction in some of the shots. Some of the shots were sour, but most are on the bitter side, and when I adjust the grind size, I only barely move the dial (to finer if sour, to coarser if bitter)., so I am somewhat surprised to get the coffee from sour to bitter without moving the dial much. Maybe I am just grinding too fine all the time so I sometimes get overextracted bitter shots and sometimes uneven extraction where I feel the acidity?

I am wondering whether my logic is wrong, so here is my question - can I expect the same results from Eureka using the recipe I used with ESP? I thought that the recipe should remain the same, so I focused on grind size, while keeping the other variables constant (11.5g in, 25.5-26.5g out, in about 24-27 seconds - I use time only as a check and not focusing on it as a variable). So should I keep going with this approach (targeting 25.5-26.5g out in similar time and playing with grind size until I get where I want to be) or should I completely start from the beginning - finding the grind size that produces desired flow and okay taste and then play with yield?

P.S. I use Bambino Plus with IMS 14g-18g basket. And yes, I know I‚Äôm underdosing, but with ESP it didn‚Äôt really affect taste, only made the puck a bit more soupy, so I would expect the same with Eureka. ",1,1758191417.0,espresso,6,1.0,False
1nk4mwr,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1nk4mwr/i_think_im_completely_burned_out/,I think I‚Äôm completely burned out,"I‚Äôm a 27 year old corporate / business lawyer in the UK at the top firm in my region. I‚Äôve been qualified for exactly 2 years now and I‚Äôve been put forward for a promotion. 

Before this, I was a trainee solicitor for 2 years, and before that, I was of course in university studying law while working part time in retail and coffee shops.

I‚Äôm essentially at the beginning of my career but I feel completely burned out. The work is interesting, but the pressure is what I think is draining me. I‚Äôve handled it well so far, but the last 6 months have been quite hard (working until midnight multiple times a week, including on Fridays). 

While pay is good, it‚Äôs still 3-4x less than what i‚Äôd be earning if I worked in London (cost of living comparison I‚Äôm still earning 2-3x less), though, working in London would be even more brutal hours.

I‚Äôve been taking semi regular vacation time but I never feel rejuvenated when I return. In March, I had a few days off work where I just relaxed. In July, I had a week off and went to South America. In August I had a long weekend where I did nothing. Last week I took a week off and went to London. And I still have 4 days left of leave to take. 

That being said, the reason I think I don‚Äôt feel rejuvenated is because I keep coming back to a full on and intense workload. Every day just feels like a long day.

I came back to work yesterday but basically did nothing and even though I have so much work to do today I have barely any drive. I just want to sleep, even though I fell asleep at like 10:30pm yesterday and woke up at 8:30am today. I‚Äôve barely done anything at work and it‚Äôs 11:30am now.

Maybe I just need to move job and the excitement of a new workplace might help. ",36,1758191400.0,productivity,16,0.96,False

But the one who delivers it to her table is Tyler, who slides into the bench on the opposite side of the table with his smile we see in the first season. He would slide the coffee over to her and say.

Tyler: It's been a awhile Wednesday. How have you been?

I think this would be an awesome way to bring Tyler into season 3. We get to see a season 1 Tyler again but with a healthier mind set and far more confident than before. I'd like to believe that the Hyde Pack would do wonders for Tyler. The tiktok edits would go wild aswell, if this is Tyler's entrance into season 3.

I would also love there to be a scene where Tyler and Wednesday are dancing to the song Sway by Michael Bubl√©. (This probably won't happen, but a guy can dream!)",11,1758191364.0,weyler,2,0.86,False

1nk4li4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nk4li4/where_to_find_affordable_electric_kettles_for_sale/,Where to find affordable electric kettles for sale?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience finding the perfect electric kettle since I know a lot of us are looking for affordable options that don't sacrifice quality. After my old kettle died last month, I spent weeks researching and comparing different models.

I love my morning tea ritual, and having a reliable electric kettle is essential. The problem is, many high-end models cost $100+, which seems crazy for boiling water. But I discovered some fantastic budget-friendly options that work just as well.

During my search, I found this amazing collection of electric kettles at really reasonable prices: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. They have everything from basic models to ones with temperature control for different types of tea.

What I've learned is that you don't need to spend a fortune to get a good kettle. The key features to look for are:

- Fast boiling time (under 5 minutes)
- Auto shut-off safety feature
- At least 1.5L capacity
- BPA-free materials
- Decent warranty coverage

I ended up getting a stainless steel model that has all these features for under $30. It heats water faster than my old kettle and has this cool blue LED light when it's running. Plus, the base is 360-degree rotational, which is super convenient.

For those interested in comparing prices and reading reviews, you can check out the full selection here: https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. They regularly update their inventory with new deals.

Some pro tips I've learned:
- Clean your kettle monthly with vinegar to prevent mineral buildup
- Don't overfill past the max line
- Let it cool completely before storing
- Keep the cord wrapped when not in use to prevent damage

My new kettle has been a game-changer for my morning routine. It's perfect for tea, instant coffee, oatmeal, and even quick noodles. The best part? It uses less energy than heating water on the stove.

What's your experience with electric kettles? Have you found any great deals lately? Let me know in the comments!",1,1758191258.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
