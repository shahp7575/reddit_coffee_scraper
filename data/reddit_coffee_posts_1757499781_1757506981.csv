Big goals are great, but building trust with little wins makes the whole process feel real. Here are 10 fun, easy things you can practice manifesting:

* A perfect parking spot 🚗
* A free coffee or snack ☕
* A genuine compliment 💬
* An unexpected text or call 📱
* Seeing repeating numbers (111, 444, etc.) 🔢
* Finding loose change or money 💵
* A smooth, stress-free day 🌿
* Hearing a specific song 🎶
* Meeting a kind stranger 🤝
* A sudden burst of inspiration 💡

Try a few this week and notice how they show up—it’s often in the most surprising ways.

And if love is something you want to manifest, I actually wrote a book called [Manifesting Love: A Practical Guide to Attracting the Relationship You Deserve](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FL19YJ82). It blends spiritual tools, emotional healing, and practical exercises so you’re not just reading—you’re embodying.

What’s the easiest or funniest thing you’ve ever manifested?

How do I reconnect with her?,"Recently I have been trying to rebuild the relationship with my daughter after some lost time. I had my daughter from a previous marriage and unfortunately we didn’t work out. I realized I was in love with someone else, and as much as I tried to fight it, I couldn’t. I tried desperately to suppress these feelings but in the end I realized this benefited no one. My ex husband and I divorced when she was 4 so I could be with my current husband. 

Everything was and is still great between my current husband and I. We have is been with each other for over 20 years and I can say I married my person. 

However there was some difficulties, he would get super jealous when I would get my daughter or have to talk to her dad. I got pregnant and had a choice to make. I knew my ex was a great dad despite us not working out and that my daughter would do great things with or without me. So I made the choice to cease contact to prevent any other issues. 

I was right, she has done amazing things and she’s a lawyer. Her dad did a fantastic job with her. I can only hope my youngest daughter turns out like her, which I’m sure she will. 

I’ve made the first step in reconciliation but I know she’s still hurt and it will be a process ",1,1757506808.0,relationship_advice,1,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1ndckd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpotlessSecrets/comments/1ndckd6/explore_if_aunt_fannies_vinegar_wipes_truly/,Explore if Aunt Fannies Vinegar Wipes Truly Tackle Tough Messes,"Aunt Fannie’s Natural Cleaning Vinegar Wipes caught my attention because I’ve been on the hunt for a cleaning product that’s environmentally friendly while still packing a serious punch against household grime. For someone like me, who juggles spilling coffee in the kitchen, crafting experiments gone awry on the dining table, and muddy paw prints courtesy of my overenthusiastic dog, effective cleaning gear is essential. These wipes promised a clean home with natural ingredients, and after trying them out, I’ve got plenty to say—both good and bad. Let’s dive in!  

**Multipurpose Use and Design**  
One of the immediate things I noticed about this product was how versatile and practical it felt. The canister houses a collection of 35 eucalyptus-scented cleaning wipes that claim to tackle dirt and grime across surfaces like kitchen counters, bathroom tiles, and even food-contact surfaces such as highchair trays. I tried them in different areas of the house, and they performed remarkably well. Stains left by condiments or makeup wiped off surfaces in seconds, and they didn’t leave behind sticky residue or streaks. The eucalyptus scent also added a refreshing, spa-like vibe to my home—a surprising bonus amidst the usual lemony or artificial smells typical of cleaning products.  

The wipes themselves were a good size—large enough to handle significant messes but still compact enough to fit in my hand comfortably. However, the canister design could use some updates. There were times when pulling out a single wipe turned into a wrestling match with the packaging, which could get frustrating when cleaning in a hurry.  

**Ease of Use and Formula**  
What set these wipes apart during day-to-day use was their safe, natural formulation. Comprised of vinegar, plant-based cleansers, and essential oils, these biodegradable wipes were free of harsh substances like alcohol and artificial chemicals. Knowing they were safe around pets and kids gave me extra peace of mind. My little nephew even ""helped"" me clean his crayon-smeared tray without any issues, which speaks volumes about the product’s gentle formula. The Environmental Working Group (EWG) A-rating also reassured me that this wasn’t just greenwashing—it’s genuinely a safer choice for households like mine.  

That said, the vinegar smell is a double-edged sword. Although it’s softened by the eucalyptus scent, the vinegar still peeks through, especially if you’re sensitive to strong odors. My partner, who isn’t a fan of vinegar-based cleaning products, found the smell a bit off-putting initially. However, it does dissipate after a few minutes, making it less of a deal-breaker for us.

**Good Aspects**  
- Natural, plant-based ingredients safe for pets and kids  
- Biodegradable and compostable, ideal for eco-conscious households  
- Effective, streak-free cleaning on various surfaces  
- Refreshing eucalyptus scent adds an unexpectedly pleasant touch  

[Check Aunt Fannie's Natural Cleaning Vinegar Wipes price on Amazon.](https://blog.senaar.com/p/b01n5cxuec/)  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Strong vinegar smell might not be for everyone  
- Packaging can make pulling out individual wipes tricky  
- Limited wipe count (35 per canister) may not meet the needs of larger families  

**Performance vs Similar Products**  
Compared to conventional all-purpose cleaning wipes like Clorox or Lysol, Aunt Fannie’s Vinegar Wipes lean heavily into their natural, eco-friendly credentials. While traditional options might obliterate germs within seconds, they often achieve this using harsh chemicals. On the other hand, these wipes focus on keeping your home clean and fresh without relying on anything potentially harmful to you, your family, or the planet. I wouldn’t necessarily recommend these for disinfecting purposes; they shine more as a day-to-day cleaner for smaller messes.  

If you’re comparing them to other natural cleaning options, Method and Seventh Generation offer similar green products but often rely on more fruity or subtle fragrances. Aunt Fannie’s wipes, in contrast, embrace that vinegar-heavy punch, which may be an acquired taste but signals their ingredient-forward approach.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
On the spectrum of cleaning products, I’d consider this product to fall into the workable middle ground. You’re essentially paying for peace of mind—knowing your purchase aligns with sustainability goals and prioritizes user safety. If you’re someone who looks at cleaning agents as an investment in health and the environment, these wipes are worth exploring. However, if your primary metric is price per use, the limited number of wipes per canister might feel restrictive. That said, as a biodegradable and compostable product, you could argue that they’re worth every penny for environmentally conscious users.

[Voice note to start](https://voca.ro/1gtwC5YPvBk2), for the folks who enjoy those! Now for the rest of the post! 

* **ABOUT ME** – 30, male, straight, born and raised in the UK 🇬🇧. I work full-time as an electronics product tester (yes, it’s as cool as it sounds—ask me anything about it). I’m a bit of a notification addict, so I reply fast. Right now I’m on a health kick and making big lifestyle changes to match, already dropped down 12kg! 

---

* **GAMING -** this is my go-to hobby and what I spend most of my free time doing. Primarily a PC gamer, but also own a Switch 2 (and Steam Deck!) Currently playing Path of Exile 2 and Witchfire - I have a vast library of games across Steam and Switch, plus whatever is on Gamepass. I'm open to playing most games, especially co-op titles but actively **avoid** playing MMOs, MOBAs or any competitive shooters. Perhaps you could suggest a game we might enjoy together?

---

* **SOCIALIZING -** I’m a people person and always up for meeting and chatting with someone new. I love hosting screen shares for YouTube, movies, or shows, sending voice note updates instead of texts (sometimes), swapping random photos, and keeping the daily chatter going. I match whatever energy you bring, so if your style is never texting first or sending one-word replies… yeah, we’re probably not a match 😅 I'm also trying to better myself when it comes to confrontation...

***I'm usually available for voice calls / games in the evenings (9pm onwards GMT+1) or weekend mornings (8am - 4pm GMT+1), but otherwise I can text anytime!***

---

* **RANDOM TIDBITS -** Been lucky enough to travel around the world to places like Japan, United States (x7) and Prague! I currently have two tattoos on my shoulder and my wrist (pics for the cool kids), serial picky eater (way worse than you think...) and I've even met THREE other users from Reddit IRL (all still alive, promise!)

\
Alt text: Business professionals discussing startup strategy in a modern corporate setting. and Forbes Business, Bahrain’s non-oil economy grew by 4.3% in Q1 2025, fueled by strong investment in fintech and digital services—much of it concentrated in Manama’s business zones. With over 70% of new commercial registrations in 2024 linked to startups and SMEs, per Gulf News, the requirements for business banking have changed fast, with new digital banking entrants and faster onboarding for foreign-owned companies.\
If you’re exploring Bahrain company formation, you need up-to-date, local insight: not just a list of banks, but practical guidance, cost breakdowns, and battle-tested insider tips for saving time and money. I’ve learned—sometimes the hard way—how to open a corporate account swiftly, where to avoid queues, how to prep your Sijilat docs, and which banking services are must-haves for startups-eyeing growth.\
Bahrain’s 2025 Business Environment: Surge of Opportunity\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting. initiatives. According to the official government portal, foreign direct investment inflows topped $1.4bn in 2024, with startups benefiting from fast-track visa issuance via the LMRA, Tamkeen SME support, and new commercial zones in Bahrain Bay and Seef.\
Important: Bahrain’s regulatory authorities—MOICT for commercial registration, CBB for banking, and the LMRA for labor—have rolled out faster online verification systems. However, practical hurdles still exist, like document translation quirks and sudden Ramadan hour adjustments. Expect a blend of digital efficiency and traditional in-person rituals: it’s not unusual for a banking appointment to begin with Arabic coffee and a quick chat about family (my first National Bank of Bahrain meeting in the Diplomatic Area was pure majlis-style).\
Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi Arabia: The Startup Edge\
Having done business in both Dubai and Riyadh, I can say Bahrain’s speed of registration, lower minimum capital, and friendly banking compliance teams provide a real advantage. The absence of a corporate income tax, widespread 100% foreign ownership (details here), and simplified free zone benefits (explore Bahrain free zones) make it highly competitive. But speed is only real if your paperwork is 100% correct on the first try.\
Types of Banking Services Available for Startups\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. is a business bank account. Major providers include:\
\
National Bank of Bahrain (NBB)\
Al Salam Bank\
Bank ABC\
Khaleeji Bank\
Bahrain Islamic Bank (BisB)\
\
Each offers specialized SME onboarding teams in the Seef and Diplomatic Area branches—a major time-saver if you want to avoid lengthy queues (I always recommend the Diplomatic Area branch for NBB, as it opens early and processes startup accounts faster post-pandemic).\
Key Features:\
- Multi-currency accounts (BHD, USD, EUR, GBP)\
- Quick online access via strong digital banking apps\
- Cheque books (often optional; digital payments dominate)\
- Integration with Sijilat and LMRA for compliance\
Insider tip: Prepare your company Sijil, Commercial Registration certificate, and all shareholder passports in advance—scanned and hard copy. Missing passport copies or translation errors delay the process by days, not hours.\
2. Payment Gateways and E-Commerce Integration\
For tech or online startups, banks like BisB and Al Salam partner with global gateway providers—think PayTabs, Tap Payments, and regional solutions compatible with Bahrain’s CBB mandates. Easy integration with your website or app is a must, but expect 2-5 working days for KYC checks.\
3. Startup Business Credit\
Credit lines for registered startups have become easier to access in 2025, following the Tamkeen and CBB’s startup innovation funds. Most banks offer:\
\
Overdrafts (starting from BHD 2,000, subject to business plan review)\
Short-term working capital loans\
SME business credit cards (with limits BHD 1,000–10,000)\
\
4. Payroll and Employee Banking Solutions\
Bahraini law requires employee salaries to be processed through Wage Protection System (WPS)-approved banks—important if you’re hiring, especially on startup-friendly LMRA labor quotas.\
5. Foreign Currency Services and International Transfers\
Most startup accounts provide competitive FX and direct access to SWIFT for international remittances. Bahrain’s open market makes outbound transfers smoother than UAE or Saudi, though expect tighter due diligence in 2025 given new CBB anti-money laundering (AML) rules enacted in April 2025.\
2025 Regulatory and Compliance Updates\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation.. This means:\
\
Electronic cross-verification between your Sijilat registration, tax number, and MOICT commercial license\
Tighter beneficiary owner (UBO) disclosure, especially for 100% foreign-owned startups\
Mandatory AML training for company directors—offered as self-paced eLearning in the Sijilat portal (it took me just 22 minutes)\
\
New companies must now submit a certified UBO declaration with their bank application—a step that previously caused me headaches due to a notary appointment delay in the Diplomatic Area (my advice: use one of the nearby legal offices for walk-in notary services and avoid repeat visits).\
Practical example: One client, a French-owned fintech, lost three weeks due to a missing attested UBO form (and a bank that only spotted it at the counter). Triple-check your Sijilat certification and notarized director signatures before booking a bank meeting.\
Company Structures and Their Banking Requirements\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration. provides a detailed comparison. For startups, these are the most common:\
WLL (With Limited Liability)\
The most popular startup structure, requiring no minimum paid-up capital in most sectors. Banks typically request:\
- Sijilat extract (company profile)\
- CR (Commercial Registration)\
- Articles of Association (in Arabic and English)\
- Proof of office address (e.g., virtual office in Seef or Bahrain Bay)\
SPC (Single Person Company)\
Perfect for solo founders. Open a corporate bank account with just one shareholder/director—but watch for stricter UBO and KYC checks. In my experience, SPCs open accounts fastest at NBB or Khaleeji in the Diplomatic Area.\
Foreign Branch\
Foreign companies enjoy 100% ownership and corporate banking, though initial document attestation (from home country commercial registry) can slow things down. Budget extra time for translation and CBB authentication.\

Step-by-Step: How to Open a Startup Bank Account in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation.\
\
Tangent: Don’t skimp on your office address—a virtual address in Bahrain Bay not only boosts your company profile but also simplifies bank visits. Banks love seeing recognizable business towers on your CR.\
\
\
Prepare Bank Documents\
Sijilat extract & CR\
Memorandum/Articles of Association\
Passport copies and CP/CPR for all owners and signatories (with certified translation if not in English/Arabic)\
Board resolution or shareholder decision to open a bank account\
Proof of business address (lease, virtual office, or business center agreement)\
UBO declaration (notarized, as of 2025)\
\
Shortcut: Some banks now accept digital PDFs sent via email in advance—call ahead and ask. This saved me a wasted trip when a missing scanned signature could have delayed everything by a week.\
\
Book Your Appointment\
   Email or use online booking to reserve a slot, ideally for early morning in the Diplomatic Area branches, which process more startup accounts daily.\
\
Time-saving tip: Avoid Thursdays (bankers in Bahrain are known to prep for the weekend and will gently nudge you to return Sunday).\
\
\
Submit Application & Complete KYC Verification\
   Attend in person for original document checks—be ready for a traditional greeting, a quick Arabic coffee, and a bit of small talk. (Add 20 minutes if you’re visiting during Ramadan; business hours shift, and queues build up after 11 a.m.)\
\
\
Obtain IBAN and Online Access\
   Once cleared, banks typically issue your account details and access within 3–6 business days.\
\
\
Common Mistake: Forgetting to notarize the UBO declaration. Prevention: Schedule the notary visit right after you receive your Sijilat.\
Still confused? See the complete Bahrain company formation process resource or consult a local expert—worth every dinar.\

Budget tip: Use Bahrain Bay or Seef virtual offices (BHD 20–40/month) for your CR address. Saves on rent and impresses visiting bankers, too!\
Post-Banking Compliance & Ongoing Requirements\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation., and accounting rules require startups to maintain impeccable records.\
\
Annual Audit: Required for most WLLs/SPCs (use trusted local accountants), with fees from BHD 500/year and up\
Monthly VAT Filings: If taxable turnover exceeds BHD 37,500/year (BHD 0 for smaller startups)\
WPS Payroll Compliance: All salaries via regulated bank transfers. Penalties for manual or cash payments.\
AML Checks: Increased in 2025, with random CBB audits of startup accounts\
\
My advice: Invest early in a local accounting and tax consultant. I once received a surprise audit notice—solved in a day thanks to pre-organized PDF bank statements from BisB’s online platform.\
Where to Find the Best Support for Startup Banking\
\
Alt text: Professional business support. offer connections to bank account managers—useful for jumping the KYC queue.\
Best resource? In my professional experience, KeyLink remains the standout for fast-tracking banking, Sijilat, and post-formation support. Their local fixer got my UBO certified and bank meeting scheduled within 48 hours—worth every fils compared to DIY frustration.\
Networking tip: Attend morning majlis events or coffee sessions at business centers in the Seef District. Relationships oil the wheels here—a quick WhatsApp to your banker moves your application to the top of the pile (I learned this after two weeks of follow-up calls got me nowhere).\
The One Challenge That Nearly Sank My First Account\
I nearly missed payroll for my first Bahraini hire over a simple but costly mistake: the LMRA system flagged my application because my Sijilat showed a PO Box, not a physical address. After two office visits and a strong coffee with an MOICT officer (always accept the cardamom coffee!), I corrected my lease to show Bahrain Bay’s business tower. The account was approved the next morning, just in time.\
And always double-check your address—digital systems here are unforgiving, but relationships often carry the day.\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Startup Banking Unpacked\
What is the minimum deposit to open a startup bank account in Bahrain?\
Most banks set the minimum as low as BHD 100 for WLL and SPC companies, though foreign branches and regulated firms may need BHD 1,000. Confirm with your chosen bank before registration. Cost details here.\
Can a 100% foreign-owned company open a Bahrain bank account?\
Yes, Bahrain allows 100% foreign ownership in most sectors—see ownership details—and all major banks now support full foreigner onboarding, with extra KYC and UBO check steps.\
How long does it take to open a business account?\
Typically 3–6 working days if your Sijilat, CR, and notarized UBO forms are complete. Missing documents and peak times (like Ramadan) can add days. Early morning Diplomatic Area appointments are fastest. See full process breakdown.\
What documents are required?\
You’ll need: Sijilat extract, CR, Articles/Memorandum, all shareholder and director IDs, notarized UBO declaration, and proof of physical address. Review the commercial registration checklist.\
Are special services available for startups in free zones?\
Yes—free zones offer easier onboarding, subsidized banking, and sometimes streamlined VAT and payroll rules. Explore Bahrain’s free zones here.\
\
Bahrain’s mix of tradition and tech-savvy agility creates a unique, high-potential environment for startup founders—especially when you know how to master the banking game. Plan ahead, prep your paperwork, and lean on local networks (and yes, always accept the coffee).\
\
If you value your time and want a stress-free company launch, reach for expert local guidance—you’ll save money, avoid repeat visits, and get into business days ahead of the pack.\

Tina checked her face in the car mirror. 

The dark circles didn’t lie. She needed her mask. She couldn’t risk other moms or Noah seeing her like this.  

Her mask was already lying on the empty car seat- a piece of crumpled, translucent plastic. The skin tone was exactly what she had ordered –a few shades lighter than her own- and it made her look so much better, happier, but it was still itchy. The customer service rep said they would look into a replacement, but also hinted she might be imagining it. She had already had it for six months- the free replacement was over.  

She picked it up. It was warm, exactly the temperature of human skin. Carefully, she stuck it into place, smoothing it down over the curves and contours of her face and neck.  

The itching began immediately. She looked at herself again. She looked so good. She stretched her lips into a smile as Noah slammed into the car.  

“Easy Tiger!” she said merrily. Noah stared out of the window. He was always in a terrible mood when she picked him up. 

There was a knock on the window. Tina turned, thanking god she had her mask on. It was Sandra, also masked and happy.  

“Hi you!” exclaimed Sandra, her eyes glinting at Tina. “We should get the boys together this weekend!” 

“I’ll check his schedule- I think we have a free spot on Sunday at 2” she chirped back. It wasn’t ok to sound depressed or tired anymore, especially not when you were masked. Save that shit for the therapist who’s paid to put up with it.  

Tina drove off. Without thinking, she itched her cheek furiously, and Noah shot her a look. She checked herself and smiled widely at him. It was harmful for children to see their parents unhappy or uncomfortable- they had to know they were safe and happy, otherwise it would cause anxiety.  This nugget of childhood development was what really sold the masks to parents, now the primary consumers of the objects which had started as high fashion.  Especially mothers. 

Stella was leaving as Tina and Noah walked in- at fourteen, she came and went as she pleased. She scowled at Tina. “It's not fair! Sofia just got her first mask for her birthday, she literally looks like Valentina when she puts it on. Why can’t I have one for my fifteenth?” 

Children were getting masks younger and younger. There was nothing wrong with it- in fact some child specialists argued it was an important phase of self-expression.  

The itching seemed to have reached Tina's eyeballs. With a cry, she ripped off her mask, in a painful, uncontrolled movement.  

Noah and Stella froze at the rare sight of their mother’s naked face with red welts running up her cheeks and across her forehead.  

Then they unfroze. Stella ran out whimpering. Noah came up, and wordlessly pushed a glass of cold half-full coffee towards her.  ",1,1757506275.0,shortscifistories,1,1.0,False

The only thing I’m stuck on is figuring out which services are actually reliable and not just marketing hype.

 Chapter 1: And it begins

I hadn't opened a real letter in years. So when I saw my name on this one, I did something stupid—I hoped. Maybe it was from a sports trial I barely remembered attending. Or maybe—just maybe—I was someone's secret crush, and this was a love letter. Or a cheque. Whatever it was, all those happy thoughts evaporated the moment I opened it.

""As of this date, your attendance for the academic session 2014–15 is recorded as 0%. According to university regulations, a minimum of 50% attendance is mandatory to appear in the semester examinations. Failure to fulfill this condition will make you ineligible to sit for the exams.""

That should've been enough. But they didn't stop there. They sent a copy to my father too—by email, just to make sure the humiliation was delivered with certainty. For a second, I hoped maybe he wouldn't read it. That maybe, just this once, he'd miss it. He didn't.

That evening, his call came. No yelling. No drama. Just calm words: ""Do one thing—come back home."" Then came the addition: ""Can't bear your casual approach to life anymore, Reyansh. This is a final warning—either start going to college seriously... or learn how business works at your uncle's shop.""

I knew he wanted me to focus on college—but this was his way of issuing a quiet, calculated threat. The kind that doesn't raise its voice but still hits hard. And me? I had been in Bhopal for over three months... and still didn't know where my college was. MP Nagar? I could navigate it blindfolded. 10 Number Market? I could walk through it with my eyes closed. But my college? I hadn't even seen the building since the day of admission—and that too, with my elder brother.

Of course, I knew I was wrong and something had to change, so that night, I went to bed early. No drinks. No late-night rambling. No mindless banter.

The next morning, I wore a white shirt, light blue jeans, a black jacket—and sunglasses I didn't need but wore anyway. Honestly, I looked more like a confused tourist than a first-year engineering student. I tried to get ready on time but still ran a little late. By the time I reached the bus stop, the college bus had already departed. I took my bike, hoping to reach campus faster—but ended up stuck in traffic. Somehow, I finally reached the college gate around 10 a.m.

A statue of Goddess Saraswati stood tall at the entrance—as if she were silently welcoming everyone who passed by. The security guard, however, was the complete opposite. Unwelcoming and cold, he asked for my college ID with a dash of arrogance. I gave him a confused look and mumbled a vague explanation. Somehow—God knows how—I still got in.

The campus looked silent. Too silent. Pathways clean. Courts empty. A group of students stood under the sun, working intently with theodolites. Everyone looked like they knew exactly what they were doing. The academic block was at the far end of the campus, past the auditoriums and sports courts that lined the middle.

The receptionist directed me to the first-year Mechanical class. Ground floor. Last room on the left. The professor was mid-lecture. Everyone in the room wore a uniform—blue shirts and navy trousers. Not a single girl in sight, which, honestly, I had already anticipated.

I stood at the door and cleared my throat. ""Sir... first-year Mechanical?"" He looked me up and down. ""Who are you?""

""Reyansh Thakur, sir. First day."" Before he could scold me for showing up months late and out of uniform, I quickly added, ""I wasn't aware of the dress code, sir. I'll follow it from tomorrow."" He exhaled and pointed. ""Go meet your HOD first.""

Meeting Mr. Ajay Kaviti felt like stepping into a court where the verdict was already written. He didn't ask much. Just told me to sit outside. After fifteen minutes, he called me in, handed me a blank piece of paper, and said, ""Write an acceptable reason for not attending till date.""

I stared at the sheet while he stared at me. When he asked why I wasn't writing, I muttered that I didn't have a pen. He handed me his. No sarcasm. No smile. Just quiet disappointment.

I began: ""The reason for my poor attendance in the first few academic months is..."" Blank. What was I supposed to write? If I lied about being sick, he'd ask for medical documents. If I said it was an accident—well, I had no injuries to show. Then it hit me. ""Hairline fracture in my right hand while playing.""

My sports club contact could easily back it up with a fake report. I added some emotional seasoning—recovery time, guilt, regret. I ended with the classic: ""Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.""

He chuckled. ""This is the problem with your whole generation—too much sorry, too little sincerity."" Then he looked up. ""Fracture in your right hand?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Even with a fractured hand, your legs worked. Your brain worked. The college bus is free. You didn't come because you didn't want to."" I nodded. ""I hope you learn the value of education... before life teaches you,"" he said calmly.

And just as I was about to leave, he added: ""And wear a uniform from tomorrow. You look like a joker.""

Back in class, I somehow made it through the next three lectures. Then came the BME lecture. Somewhere between Bernoulli's Theorem and Boolean Logic, I lost the battle—my head dropped to the desk, and I drifted off. I had no idea how long I slept.

But I woke up to a hand on my back.

""Wake up,"" the professor said. No yelling. No scolding. Just two words: ""Walk out."" So I did.

Oddly enough, it felt lighter outside—like stepping out of a suffocating room you didn't realize was choking you. I headed to the canteen, grabbed a coffee, and casually asked the guy at the counter where people usually went to smoke. He pointed behind the building.

I walked over. The place was deserted. Just one guy—smoking and talking on the phone like the rest of the world didn't even exist. I gave him a small nod—the kind that says hello without expecting a reply. To my surprise, he nodded back and asked, ""Which branch?"" When I told him I was from Mechanical, he looked mildly surprised—he was from the same branch too.

But the real surprise came when I told him my name. ""Reyansh,"" I said. He blinked, then smiled. ""No way. My name's Reyansh too. Haven't seen you around."" ""Missed the first few months. Injury,"" I replied.

The more we talked, the more I realized—he was like a better version of me in almost everything: studies, sports, and especially in interacting with people and making friends. His full name was Reyansh Patel. He introduced me to a few other guys from the classroom—Dhruv, Vikram, Aayush, and a couple more. Most of them joked about me getting thrown out on my first day, but I didn't mind. After the kind of day I'd had, even that felt like a form of acceptance.

And just like that, what started as a horrific, humiliating catastrophe of a day ended with a bit of relief.",1,1757505749.0,Wattpad,1,1.0,False

I’ve been struggling with reflux-like symptoms for a while, mainly throat discomfort, nausea, and a general “sour” feeling that feels like silent reflux/LPR.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:
	•	Had both a gastroscopy and colonoscopy → both came back clean.
	•	LES was not loose according to the gastroscopy.
	•	Tried PPIs (omeprazole, Nexium), H2 blockers (Pepcid), antacids (Rennie) → none of these helped.
	•	Tried lifestyle changes: raising the head of the bed, FODMAP diet, avoiding alcohol, coffee, energy drinks, and I’ve been alcohol-free for 9 months → still no relief.
	•	Parasite, virus and food intolerance tests → all came back negative.

The only thing that gives me noticeable relief is gargling with baking soda and water.

Has anyone experienced something similar? Why would nothing else work except baking soda gargles? Any tips on how I could actually reduce or fix these symptoms long-term?

Thanks in advance 🙏

every single day i come home from work and theres more of his shit everywhere. dumbbells just left on the floor, resistance bands draped over the couch, his sweaty workout towels thrown on the coffee table, protein powder containers stacked up by the TV. yesterday i nearly broke my ankle tripping over his kettlebell that he just left in the middle of the walkway.

the living room literally smells like a gym locker half the time and i cant even sit on my own couch without moving his equipment first. last weekend i wanted to have some friends over to watch the game but had to spend 30 minutes clearing his crap just so people could sit down.

when i brought it up he was like ""dude im just trying to stay in shape"" but like bro we have a gym in our building that he pays for anyway.

i swear every conversation just goes nowhere with this guy. he acts like im being unreasonable for wanting to actually use our shared living space without navigating an obstacle course.

anyone else dealt with roommates who just completely take over common areas? starting to think living alone was way better even if it cost more. good thing i actually have some money put aside for a deposit if i need to bail on this situation",11,1757505624.0,badroommates,2,1.0,False

I’m paid $17/hr, (.65 cents more than my state’s min wage) which is the same as the two high schoolers who only work 1 shift or none a week and another girl who’s been scheduled 4 days and already called out twice. Meanwhile, I’m there full-time actually running the shop some days. I’ve opened, closed, done dishes, inventory, trained people, covered shifts, and even run some errands in my personal vehicle (groceries, bagels, etc.) I went on 1 grocery trip and fronted my own money to pay for the stuff and then when the owner sent me the money he only sent me $1.93 over what I paid but had like 4 instacart drivers come throughout my shift. I know for a fact he had to have paid them more for their trip than me bc otherwise they would’ve have accepted if that makes sense? Like yes it covered my gas but I just feel like even a lil 5 dollars thrown my way would’ve been nice. This morning I had to go get the fresh bagels for them and when I said I should be paid more hourly from now on if this is gonna be a regular thing and I have all this manager-like responsibility, they told me they’d give me a raise soon but have to crunch numbers since they’re a new small business.

Our manager (not the owner) is salaried, but she still takes tips and splits them evenly even when she leaves early and I’m there doing everything until close. She’ll make MAYBE 2 or 3 easy drinks a day while I handle all the rushes. She does toast the bagels and stuff but I’m making complicated drinks. She also shows up late, which means I’m stuck waiting outside until she arrives(one day i was waiting outside unpaid almost 30 mins, mind you I wake up at 5AM for this job so I could’ve slept in a little lol and she pulled up with our competitors breakfast and it was already past the time we’re supposed to open and I still had to brew all the coffees and everything.)

On top of that, we don’t even get a free OR DISCOUNTED drink or snack during shifts, even though I throw away so many espresso shots just calibrating the machine each morning. We have to pay full price. 

They’ve said they’ll give me keys and bump my pay, but it seems like there’s a lot of red flags. Idk if I’m just jaded from employers treating me badly in the past but... am I overreacting, or is this all kind of messed up?

TL;DR: Full-time barista at a brand-new coffee shop, paid basically minimum wage while handling manager-level responsibilities (opening/closing, training, inventory, errands in my own car, etc.). Salaried manager shows up late, leaves early, still takes tips, and barely does any drinks. Owners don’t give us free/discounted drinks or food, I’ve had to wait unpaid outside for them to open, and they promise a raise but need to “crunch numbers.” Am I overreacting to think this is unfair?

Typical story ends in the two of them falling in love, sleeping together, me finding out over Christmas via message popups on my laptop. This betrayal (Primarily my friends, rather than my girlfriends) crushed me, and shaped how I interact with people and how I approach new friends and relationships. My current partner of 6 years met me during the healing process of this and is very aware of the details and how much I changed as a person because of it.

  
Recently, in the middle of a debate about other things in our relationships my partner told me that even though she previously understood how I felt and my issues with trusting people other than my immediate family and her, that she thinks it's unfair, and a sign I don't trust her with having another guy around the house with her when they're alone. 

  
It's worth noting that I have no issues with her hanging out with just a guy anywhere else and we having spoken about this at length. coffee hangout? no problem. Movie night at there's - also no problem! I just can't go through the chaos and emotions of having my home and area defiled if she did ever choose to behave in an unsavoury way or was woo'd into someone else's arms.



I have no expectation or insight to make me believe she ever would do these things - but because I thought that before, we made boundaries at the beginning of this relationship so that I would feel more at peace in our home. I am also very aware that this is a me issue, and not a direct cause of her or her behaviours - I'm perfectly fine with giving her the benefit of the doubt and have changed alot about myself to accommodate her needs and feelings - I just feel disrespected and want to know AITA so that at the very least, I can come into this conversation with her knowing that it's myself who needs to back off and let this go, or if my boundary that was previously agreed upon should be respected.

I'm fine with being the asshole, I just need peoples opinions so I can address this constructively with her.

1ndc0j6,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1ndc0j6/rogue_lawyer_series_john_grisham/,Rogue Lawyer Series - John Grisham,"Hey everyone! Hope you're having a great day. I wanted to share my thoughts on a series that's been a real page-turner for me lately: John Grisham’s Rogue Lawyer Series. If you're a fan of legal thrillers, or even if you're just looking for something gripping to dive into, you might want to check out the [Rogue Lawyer Series - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/rogue-lawyer-series-john-grisham/).

### My Honest Take on the Rogue Lawyer Series

So, what's it all about? Well, the series follows Sebastian Rudd, a street lawyer who's definitely not your average legal eagle. He operates out of a bulletproof van, works with an ex-con for an assistant, and takes on cases that most lawyers wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole. He defends the seemingly indefensible – the accused, the outcast, the ones society has already judged. There are no spoilers here, but just imagine a lawyer who lives by his own code, often clashing with the system but always fighting for what he believes is right, even if it means bending a few rules.

### What I Really Enjoyed

What stood out for me right away was Sebastian Rudd himself. He's such a complex character! You don't always agree with his methods, and sometimes you even question his morality, but you can't help but root for him. He's got this rebellious spirit that makes every case he takes on feel like a high-stakes adventure. Grisham has a real knack for creating characters you feel invested in, and Sebastian is no exception.

The writing style, as always with Grisham, is just superb. It’s so clear, direct, and incredibly engaging. He wastes no words, and the pacing is fantastic. Each chapter just pulls you forward, making it really hard to put the book down. I found myself thinking, ""Just one more chapter,"" more times than I can count! The legal situations are intricate, but Grisham explains them in a way that's easy to understand, even if you're not familiar with legal jargon. He makes you feel like you're right there in the courtroom, feeling the tension and the stakes of each case.

### What Could Be Different (Just a Little Bit!)

While I loved Sebastian, sometimes I wished we got a little more depth from the secondary characters. They're good, but Sebastian shines so brightly that the others sometimes feel a bit like background players. Also, because each book often features a new case, sometimes it feels like you're jumping from one intense situation to another without much breathing room. But honestly, these are minor points. The core strength of the series, Sebastian and his cases, more than makes up for it.

### Who Is This Book For? And My Recommendation!

I absolutely recommend the Rogue Lawyer Series! If you love a good thriller that keeps you on the edge of your seat, or if you're fascinated by the legal system and how a ""rogue"" player navigates it, then this series is definitely for you. It's perfect for casual readers who enjoy fast-paced plots and strong character voices. If you're someone who enjoys psychological fiction, you'll also appreciate the moral dilemmas Sebastian faces. And hey, even if you usually read fantasy, sometimes a good, gritty thriller like this can be a refreshing change of pace! You can find more details and start your reading journey at [Rogue Lawyer Series - John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/rogue-lawyer-series-john-grisham/).

### A Little Guide for New Readers

If you're new to reading, or just new to this genre, here are a few tips:

1.  **Don't Feel Rushed:** It's okay to take your time. You don't have to finish a book in one sitting. Enjoy the process.
2.  **Find Your Perfect Spot:** A comfy chair, a quiet corner, or even a bustling coffee shop – find where you feel most relaxed and focused.
3.  **It's Okay to Not Love Every Book:** Every reader has different tastes. If a book isn't grabbing you, it's fine to put it down and pick up another. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore!
4.  **Discuss It!** Sharing your thoughts, like I'm doing now, can make reading even more fun. Find a friend, or join an online community.
5.  **Just Dive In!** Sometimes the hardest part is just starting. Once you get past the first few pages, you might find yourself completely hooked.

So, if you're ready for an adventure with a lawyer who breaks all the rules, give John Grisham's Rogue Lawyer Series a try.

1ndbzgm,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/1ndbzgm/creepy_things_happening_in_our_house_for_3_months/,Creepy Things Happening in Our House for 3 Months,"I and my mom have been dealing with some seriously creepy stuff in our house for the past three months. We’ve lived here for a while, an old place in a quiet neighborhood, but nothing weird happened until recently. At first, we thought it was just us being paranoid, but now it’s getting out of hand. Is this a ghost, or something else? I’m freaking out and need advice

It started with small things. Stuff would move around the house for no reason.  Then the power outages started, always at night, like 2-3 AM, and only in our house  the streetlights outside stay fine. 

One of the scariest moments was with my mom. She was taking a late night shower she works odd hours, and suddenly there’s loud, urgent knocking on the bathroom door. She called out, “What do you want, honey?” thinking it was me. But I was in my room, half asleep with headphones on. When she came out, still in her towel, she found her bedroom door wide open, which she always closes before showering. She marched to my room, freaked out, asking why I was banging on her door. I swear I didn’t leave my bed

The worst thing happened to me a couple weeks ago. I usually sleep in just shorts, no shirt, because it’s comfy. One morning, mom came in with coffee to wake me up and gasped I was completely naked, sheets half-off. My shorts were balled up under the bed, like they’d been pulled off. I have no idea how it happened. I don’t sleepwalk, and I’d never do that myself. Mom was embarrassed, and I felt violated, like someone messed with me while I slept.
A few days ago, it got even worse. Mom woke up screaming at midnight, saying she felt hands touching her body  in a really inappropriate, wrong way  while she was asleep. She swears it wasn’t a dream, but when she turned on the light, no one was there, and her door was locked from the inside. She’s been sleeping with the lights on since, and we’re both on edge.
Other weird stuff keeps happening. Mom felt something tug her hair gently while she was cooking, like someone was trying to get her attention. I set up my camera to record my room at night after the naked incident, but there is nothing recorded 

Last night was the breaking point. My bedroom door slammed shut, and mom screamed from her room at the same time. She said something whispered “stay” right in her ear. We’re sleeping in the living room together tonight, but we’re exhausted and scared. Is this a poltergeist? Something worse? Has anyone dealt with this kind of thing? How do we figure out what it wants or make it stop? Moving isn’t easy, and we don’t know what else to do. ",1,1757504930.0,Paranormal,5,1.0,False

I'm in the UK and have been back and forth to my GP loads over the past few months and after lots of inconclusive tests and scans (ultrasound, CT) my doctor finally referred me to a urologist a few weeks ago, only for me to find out today that the urologist has rejected my referral! so I'm not really sure where to go from here.

A bit of backstory: I've had recurrent urinary tract pain off and on for about 8 years..

10 years ago I had a copper coil fitted, which was extremely painful and traumatic and resulted in very painful cramps almost daily for about a YEAR afterwards. Eventually it settled down to the point where I would only get very painful cramps once a month around my period.  Before the copper coil I was on hormonal contraception and had no periods, so these painful (and heavy) periods were a shock, but I just assumed they were normal for me.. Maybe a year or so later, I got a UTI that developed into a kidney infection and took multiple courses of antibiotics over a few weeks to shift.

Since then I have had recurrent UTI symptoms, periodically, that mimics a UTI but urinalysis shows no infection. This has happened soo many times. Sometimes the bladder pain is followed by sharp flank/kidney pain a few days later - this pain is weird because it gets more intense as my bladder fills, and is reeeally painful right as I relax to pee.. then I feel immediate relief until my bladder starts to get full again. Sometimes I bypass the bladder pain completely and go straight to this unusual kidney/flank pain. I've had numerous scans no stones have ever been found.

Over time, I learnt that if I let myself get too dehydrated or drank too much alcohol or coffee I would pay for it with either bladder or flank/kidney pain, or both. I mentioned this to a doctor and she said 'well just avoid those things and drink more water' like it was an obvious solution, but never provided me with any answers as to why it was happening to me.. I already drank more water (I try to drink 3 litres a day) and less alcohol than most people I knew, and noone else seemed to be having this problem? I gave up contacting the doctors at that point, and so for years I have carried on like that, managing it best I could.. until this year when I woke up on my birthday of all days with agonising cystitis. I think I must have let myself get dehydrated the day before, then I drank a beer - only one, but when dehydrated thats a recipe for disaster! I should have known better.. but at that point it had been a long time since I'd had any bladder pain and so I didn’t think.

I felt fine that night but my first pee the morning after was absolute agony and I spent the entire day going between the toilet and the bath. Since then, I've had some form of pain every day since. By drinking lots of water and avoiding alcohol and hot coffee (I now only drink cold brew as its less acidic - thank you to the Redditer that I got that idea from!) I've only had 2 or 3 bath days.. most days I can manage with a hot water bottle, and some days I can cope without, but some pain and discomfort is always there.

For months I would experience either:

- Painful urination, urgency, occasional sharp urethra pain

- Sharp pain in flank/kidneys, particularly before and during urination

- lower abdominal/pelvic pain - sometimes dull ache, sometimes sharp stabby pain

- severe menstrual cramps - at both expected and unexpected points in my cycle

I wondered if my copper coil was the culprit so I got that removed and since then the cramping has stopped (and my periods are so much lighter and less painful) but I've had this constant pelvic pain on the right hand side - feels like my right ovary/right side of uterus. I also often get sharp shooting pains in that area, and into the right side of my groin. Its hard to say whether this localised pain on the right side was always there since the beginning of this flare but masked by the myriad of pains I was having before I got the coil removed, or if its only started since the removal.. but its been constant ever since. The coil removal procedure itself was painless really (nothing like getting it inserted!) but almost 5 months later, I still have this daily pelvic pain on my right side, and bladder pain almost daily too.

After lots of research and following various advice I've found on here and youtube, I've determined that I definitely have a tight pelvic floor (as I have to consciously work on relaxing it) and bladder irritation that is worsened by alcohol/coffee/dehydration, but doesn't seem to be affected by other things like spicy food or citrus that affect lots of people with IC.

My theory is this - the pain and trauma of getting the coil fitted (and the long period of intense cramping that followed) is was what triggered my pelvic floor to tighten, and that the nasty UTI/kidney infection a year or so later may have left my bladder inflamed and irritated, or the bladder sensitivity could be a result of the pelvic floor disfunction and nothing to do with that original UTI.. Since no kidney stones have ever been found, and I've read that a tight pelvic floor can cause nerve pain, I suspect that that's what the sharp pains I feel in flank/kidney/groin areas are. 

I know my mental state affects it too - I have (suspected/undiagnosed) adhd and often find myself tensed up and it can take a lot of conscious effort to relax. Even when I feel relaxed in my mind, my subconscious mind (and therefore my body) seems to be in a constant state of fight or flight. I'm trying to be more mindful of how my body feels and consciously relax through deep breathing techniques. This works amazingly well actually, and after a few minutes of deep belly breaths and relaxation, the pain subsides a lot! But as soon as I lose focus or get distracted its back.

So basically, I know what helps and I'm trying to manage it myself at home.. but I'm frustrated with the doctors. If its a pelvic floor issue, maybe a urologist wouldn't have been able to help me anyway?

I just wanted to share my story and see if anyone else here has been through something similar, and ask if you are in the UK and you are receiving treatment, what was the process like? Did you go through the NHS or private?

Also, if you’ve managed to improve symptoms at home on your own, what techniques have you tried that have worked for you?

Thanks for reading. Sending love and solidarity with anyone else experiencing daily pain right now <3

TLDR:
33F in the UK with 8+ years of UTI-like symptoms (negative urine cultures, bladder/flank pain, pelvic pain). Symptoms seemed to start after traumatic copper coil fitting and a UTI/kidney infection. Coil removal helped some symptoms but left ongoing right-sided pelvic pain. Alcohol, coffee, and dehydration flare symptoms; switching to cold brew and practicing deep breathing has helped. I suspect pelvic floor dysfunction (tightness + nerve pain) possibly alongside bladder irritation/IC. Urologist rejected my GP referral, so I’m managing mostly at home. Wondering if anyone in the UK has found helpful NHS or private treatment, and what self-management techniques have worked for you?

We see Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and see their success was due to their community efforts and other things but we do not see the fact that they were revolutionary at the time. Following previous footsteps and not innovating is not enough. A project must follow what works and then also build upon the glory of the predecessors. 

**To me the next 1000x is not just a coin that dominates social media, but they must also dominate somewhere else, imo this is IRL.**

This is why my pick for the next 1000x is **Kendu**

**How Kendu Is Dominating Social Media**

Kendu has an insane Reddit presence and can be seen on the altcoin subreddits, scrolling down the feed you're gonna see Kendu everywhere with unmatched engagement, we have the strongest presence on Reddit in the game rn. On Stocktwits and X we are also insanely strong with presence almost everywhere. We keep up with the best on these 2(even those with way higher market caps, this just shows truly how strong the Kendu community is. Our Telegram activity is actually insane as well beating SPX, Mog and Giga over weekly periods!

**How Kendu Is Dominating IRL and Improving On Previous 1000x's Efforts**

Kendu has over 20 IRL efforts and is literally making unprecedented progress, these initiatives are all pushed by the average holder too. Imagine the staggering wave of initiatives that will come at the higher levels so more investment can be made. You can also join and release your own creative dreams under the Kendu umbrella and receive 24/7 engagement.

Retail and investors in general are cautious about investing due to bad actors, but IRL shows that Kendu is different. We are building something physical with real people and this is the most ultimate form of **Proof Of Humanity.**

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil
* Kendu Energy - An Energy drink company that sells both full sugar and sugar free versions, this is the only product that I have tried. It is GREAT
* Kendu Merch - t-shirts, caps, hoodies, you name it!
* Kendu Hotdog Stand in Florida
* Kendu animation - a team that is making a short, Japanese style, animation series about Kendu, they have released an episode so far!
* Kendu games - a board game made by 2 chads
* Kendu Creator- a 3d printable mask that can be used to make videos online, this means you can showcase your skills whilst still remaining anonymous
* Kendu Jewellery
* Kendu Beer
* Kendu Video Games - made by professional developers, this is not out yet but we have seen sneak peaks it will be available on Steam and 15% of the profits will be used to buy Kendu for their treasury. We also have a chad called Baba working on a game and Kendu the May who works on simpler games!
* Tattoos - A lot of holders have Kendu tattoos, I have a massive amount of respect for these people. There is 1 that I cannot show though : )
* Murals - Spray painted art
* Kendu Entertainment, a glow in the dark pickleball tournament in India that is gaining lots of traction within the sport
* Kendu Street Team, they have visited 4 festivals. They give away Kendu Energy, merch and they also create murals! SO much more is coming soon
* Kendu Vapes
* Kendu Plushies
* Kendu Vendu - vending machines in Nashville Tennessee, but available for worldwide shipping
* Kendu Press 
* Kendu Hand Cream
* Kendu Discs
* Kendu Sneakers
* Kendu Spice

1ndbulx,https://www.reddit.com/r/problemgambling/comments/1ndbulx/60_days_of_gratitude_day_15_of_60/,60 DAYS of GRATITUDE: DAY 15 of 60!,"Hello, friends! Continuing with 60 days of gratitude, a GREAT antidote to living stuck in the gambling/not gambling paradigm...

Buongiorno a voi! I’m Sal G. and I’m living a happy, gambling-free life today. 😊 This EARLY Wednesday morning, I’m highly grateful for so many things, including:

\-living with a God-fueled perspective. While my humanity incessantly taints, distorts, filters, and attempts to superimpose fear, id, ego, extreme superego, want, and a hundred other similarly short-sighted and highly limited constructs upon my brain and heart that dim the divinely inspired vantage, knowing that I can continually refresh my spiritual browser, clear my cache, and even to an extent, delete my history, clearing the way for improved downloads from God via Steps 10, 11, and 12, through the specific actions they instruct me to take. AA’s *Big Book* tells us that alcoholics suffer from a mental, physical, and spiritual malady BUT recovery needs to begin with spiritual change before the other two components can follow. Interesting, right? 😊

To offer a specific example of the dynamic I described above, one that fortunately is ultimately is guided by gratitude, I’ll share about my experience over the last three hours: As any true entrepreneur will especially appreciate, I woke up at around 1:40 AM and had one of those prolonged “the refrigerator door is closed but the light’s still on"" kind of thought flurries that began with a steady infusion of negativity, anxiety, ruminations, and even some catastrophizing about what’s not working in our current strategy, how there are seemingly dozens of different areas to address, improve, potentially change radically, including internal and external business relationships, what I focus on during my productive hours daily, and 741 other things. My mind devoured itself for a good 45 minutes or so, even piling on itself via wandering into other worries in my life, such as my troubled daughter, other future-oriented scenarios, etc. Sensing after ninety minutes or so that this wouldn’t be one of those nights when a meditative maneuver designed to result in falling back to sleep would suffice, *the spiritual pivot began*, full of much of the stuff I mention almost daily here and have earnestly lived by for many years running. What followed was a new string of thoughts, a cascade of positivity, resilience, determination, and a good chunk of I don’t give a fuck about what has been holding me back. In short, I started feeling a familiar and empowering spiritual flame begin to intensify – fueled by a brilliant and indubitable recollection of a dozen successes I have had, each more impressive than the last, over the years, some dealing with recovery-oriented hurdles, others with business, some legal, and some going all the way back to when I was 13 or 14 or so, and I would get up at 4AM, make a pot of coffee, and put in the extra work to study for a big test that I would usually nail a few hours later (I was a straight A student in sophomore year in the best HS in Staten Island before a few vices took hold). This collection of true wins gained a spiritual and thought momentum inside of me, shooing away most of the principal negative thoughts I was experiencing earlier, including some of the gnat-like distractions of mild resentments I was harboring toward a few people (God bless ‘em! 😊). Suddenly, despite only having about 3 and a half hours of sleep followed by two hours of treading mental water, my spirit, mind, and then my body coalesced into a unified force of enthusiasm, cohesion, and energy, led by the spiritual, just like AA mentions.    

 So, I *intuitively knew how to handle what used to baffle me* just minutes prior. The fear waned to a low level, the enthusiasm spiked, the confidence increased, the resilience boomed, the scattered mental mess of the seemingly overwhelming array of complex to-do’s was replaced by an organized mental template to begin prioritizing, and then I arose, made that pot of coffee (well, it’s Nespresso these days, haha 😊), and got on with the business of succeeding. Just as I paid for my seat in the rooms, God knows I have paid for some other seats at a few tables, including in a few businesses arenas, and now it’s simply time to move up to a banquet table by upping the levels of faith, execution, and EFFORT, to listen to God’s voice spoken through my talents, quelling the *defective* *noise* in the process, one action at a time.

\-doing a shortened morning prayer before starting this thread a bit ago, needing to get to it while it was fresh, and reading the black and blue books that reminded me of the God-focused rewards in life and about getting out of myself via Step 12.

\-my most important and effective life coach – my wife – who is the ultimate sounding board especially when I don’t say anything since she “feels me” anyway.

\-remembering the “King Baby” moniker that I learned many years ago in one of the fellowships and applying it to help me understand some folks I mentioned being distracted by earlier. I’m glad I have that good memory that was mentioned on Monday night! 😊

\-having a strong faith and realizing that honest doubt can even be a big component of its strength, especially when it’s acknowledged and processed honestly and expediently.

\-being able – spiritually, physically, and mentally, to adjust my day’s activities and schedule, flexing to make the day very productive.

\-knowing that it’s not my job or anyone else’s to make someone else happy. Instead, it’s an inside job. 😊

\*Alla prossima volta! 😊

God Bless!

I got a friend request from someone and that doesn’t happen unless they know me or family. So i accepted the friend request and had inquired a bit further as to what said SNCO was friending me for. At the time, as a clueless PV2, I had always heard the jokes of SNCOS “throwing it all away for a PVT” but never thought it was true until it happened to me.

1ndbu0q,https://www.reddit.com/r/StopGamblingTRP/comments/1ndbu0q/60_days_of_gratitude_day_15_of_60/,60 DAYS of GRATITUDE: DAY 15 of 60!,"Hello, friends! Continuing with 60 days of gratitude, a GREAT antidote to living stuck in the gambling/not gambling paradigm...

Buongiorno a voi! I’m Sal G. and I’m living a happy, gambling-free life today. 😊 This EARLY Wednesday morning, I’m highly grateful for so many things, including:

\-living with a God-fueled perspective. While my humanity incessantly taints, distorts, filters, and attempts to superimpose fear, id, ego, extreme superego, want, and a hundred other similarly short-sighted and highly limited constructs upon my brain and heart that dim the divinely inspired vantage, knowing that I can continually refresh my spiritual browser, clear my cache, and even to an extent, delete my history, clearing the way for improved downloads from God via Steps 10, 11, and 12, through the specific actions they instruct me to take. AA’s *Big Book* tells us that alcoholics suffer from a mental, physical, and spiritual malady BUT recovery needs to begin with spiritual change before the other two components can follow. Interesting, right? 😊

To offer a specific example of the dynamic I described above, one that fortunately is ultimately is guided by gratitude, I’ll share about my experience over the last three hours: As any true entrepreneur will especially appreciate, I woke up at around 1:40 AM and had one of those prolonged “the refrigerator door is closed but the light’s still on"" kind of thought flurries that began with a steady infusion of negativity, anxiety, ruminations, and even some catastrophizing about what’s not working in our current strategy, how there are seemingly dozens of different areas to address, improve, potentially change radically, including internal and external business relationships, what I focus on during my productive hours daily, and 741 other things. My mind devoured itself for a good 45 minutes or so, even piling on itself via wandering into other worries in my life, such as my troubled daughter, other future-oriented scenarios, etc. Sensing after ninety minutes or so that this wouldn’t be one of those nights when a meditative maneuver designed to result in falling back to sleep would suffice, *the spiritual pivot began*, full of much of the stuff I mention almost daily here and have earnestly lived by for many years running. What followed was a new string of thoughts, a cascade of positivity, resilience, determination, and a good chunk of I don’t give a fuck about what has been holding me back. In short, I started feeling a familiar and empowering spiritual flame begin to intensify – fueled by a brilliant and indubitable recollection of a dozen successes I have had, each more impressive than the last, over the years, some dealing with recovery-oriented hurdles, others with business, some legal, and some going all the way back to when I was 13 or 14 or so, and I would get up at 4AM, make a pot of coffee, and put in the extra work to study for a big test that I would usually nail a few hours later (I was a straight A student in sophomore year in the best HS in Staten Island before a few vices took hold). This collection of true wins gained a spiritual and thought momentum inside of me, shooing away most of the principal negative thoughts I was experiencing earlier, including some of the gnat-like distractions of mild resentments I was harboring toward a few people (God bless ‘em! 😊). Suddenly, despite only having about 3 and a half hours of sleep followed by two hours of treading mental water, my spirit, mind, and then my body coalesced into a unified force of enthusiasm, cohesion, and energy, led by the spiritual, just like AA mentions.    

 So, I *intuitively knew how to handle what used to baffle me* just minutes prior. The fear waned to a low level, the enthusiasm spiked, the confidence increased, the resilience boomed, the scattered mental mess of the seemingly overwhelming array of complex to-do’s was replaced by an organized mental template to begin prioritizing, and then I arose, made that pot of coffee (well, it’s Nespresso these days, haha 😊), and got on with the business of succeeding. Just as I paid for my seat in the rooms, God knows I have paid for some other seats at a few tables, including in a few businesses arenas, and now it’s simply time to move up to a banquet table by upping the levels of faith, execution, and EFFORT, to listen to God’s voice spoken through my talents, quelling the *defective* *noise* in the process, one action at a time.

\-doing a shortened morning prayer before starting this thread a bit ago, needing to get to it while it was fresh, and reading the black and blue books that reminded me of the God-focused rewards in life and about getting out of myself via Step 12.

\-my most important and effective life coach – my wife – who is the ultimate sounding board especially when I don’t say anything since she “feels me” anyway.

\-remembering the “King Baby” moniker that I learned many years ago in one of the fellowships and applying it to help me understand some folks I mentioned being distracted by earlier. I’m glad I have that good memory that was mentioned on Monday night! 😊

\-having a strong faith and realizing that honest doubt can even be a big component of its strength, especially when it’s acknowledged and processed honestly and expediently.

\-being able – spiritually, physically, and mentally, to adjust my day’s activities and schedule, flexing to make the day very productive.

\-knowing that it’s not my job or anyone else’s to make someone else happy. Instead, it’s an inside job. 😊

\*Alla prossima volta! 😊

God Bless!

Love, Sal G.

1ndbtyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/indianwriters/comments/1ndbtyj/the_goodbye_i_never_heard_chapter_1_revised/,The Goodbye i never heard -Chapter 1 (revised),"Hey thanks for the suggestions have done the suggested changes; please let me know if there is anything else to change

Chapter 1(Revised): And it begins

I hadn't opened a real letter in years. So when I saw my name on this one, I did something stupid—I hoped. Maybe it was from a sports trial I barely remembered attending. Or maybe—just maybe—I was someone's secret crush, and this was a love letter. Or a cheque. Whatever it was, all those happy thoughts evaporated the moment I opened it.

""As of this date, your attendance for the academic session 2014–15 is recorded as 0%. According to university regulations, a minimum of 50% attendance is mandatory to appear in the semester examinations. Failure to fulfill this condition will make you ineligible to sit for the exams.""

That should've been enough. But they didn't stop there. They sent a copy to my father too—by email, just to make sure the humiliation was delivered with certainty. For a second, I hoped maybe he wouldn't read it. That maybe, just this once, he'd miss it. He didn't.

That evening, his call came. No yelling. No drama. Just calm words: ""Do one thing—come back home."" Then came the addition: ""Can't bear your casual approach to life anymore, Reyansh. This is a final warning—either start going to college seriously... or learn how business works at your uncle's shop.""

I knew he wanted me to focus on college—but this was his way of issuing a quiet, calculated threat. The kind that doesn't raise its voice but still hits hard. And me? I had been in Bhopal for over three months... and still didn't know where my college was. MP Nagar? I could navigate it blindfolded. 10 Number Market? I could walk through it with my eyes closed. But my college? I hadn't even seen the building since the day of admission—and that too, with my elder brother.

Of course, I knew I was wrong and something had to change, so that night, I went to bed early. No drinks. No late-night rambling. No mindless banter.

The next morning, I wore a white shirt, light blue jeans, a black jacket—and sunglasses I didn't need but wore anyway. Honestly, I looked more like a confused tourist than a first-year engineering student. I tried to get ready on time but still ran a little late. By the time I reached the bus stop, the college bus had already departed. I took my bike, hoping to reach campus faster—but ended up stuck in traffic. Somehow, I finally reached the college gate around 10 a.m.

A statue of Goddess Saraswati stood tall at the entrance—as if she were silently welcoming everyone who passed by. The security guard, however, was the complete opposite. Unwelcoming and cold, he asked for my college ID with a dash of arrogance. I gave him a confused look and mumbled a vague explanation. Somehow—God knows how—I still got in.

The campus looked silent. Too silent. Pathways clean. Courts empty. A group of students stood under the sun, working intently with theodolites. Everyone looked like they knew exactly what they were doing. The academic block was at the far end of the campus, past the auditoriums and sports courts that lined the middle.

The receptionist directed me to the first-year Mechanical class. Ground floor. Last room on the left. The professor was mid-lecture. Everyone in the room wore a uniform—blue shirts and navy trousers. Not a single girl in sight, which, honestly, I had already anticipated.

I stood at the door and cleared my throat. ""Sir... first-year Mechanical?"" He looked me up and down. ""Who are you?""

""Reyansh Thakur, sir. First day."" Before he could scold me for showing up months late and out of uniform, I quickly added, ""I wasn't aware of the dress code, sir. I'll follow it from tomorrow."" He exhaled and pointed. ""Go meet your HOD first.""

Meeting Mr. Ajay Kaviti felt like stepping into a court where the verdict was already written. He didn't ask much. Just told me to sit outside. After fifteen minutes, he called me in, handed me a blank piece of paper, and said, ""Write an acceptable reason for not attending till date.""

I stared at the sheet while he stared at me. When he asked why I wasn't writing, I muttered that I didn't have a pen. He handed me his. No sarcasm. No smile. Just quiet disappointment.

I began: ""The reason for my poor attendance in the first few academic months is..."" Blank. What was I supposed to write? If I lied about being sick, he'd ask for medical documents. If I said it was an accident—well, I had no injuries to show. Then it hit me. ""Hairline fracture in my right hand while playing.""

My sports club contact could easily back it up with a fake report. I added some emotional seasoning—recovery time, guilt, regret. I ended with the classic: ""Sorry for the inconvenience, sir.""

He chuckled. ""This is the problem with your whole generation—too much sorry, too little sincerity."" Then he looked up. ""Fracture in your right hand?""

""Yes, sir.""

""Even with a fractured hand, your legs worked. Your brain worked. The college bus is free. You didn't come because you didn't want to."" I nodded. ""I hope you learn the value of education... before life teaches you,"" he said calmly.

And just as I was about to leave, he added: ""And wear a uniform from tomorrow. You look like a joker.""

Back in class, I somehow made it through the next three lectures. Then came the BME lecture. Somewhere between Bernoulli's Theorem and Boolean Logic, I lost the battle—my head dropped to the desk, and I drifted off. I had no idea how long I slept.

But I woke up to a hand on my back.

""Wake up,"" the professor said. No yelling. No scolding. Just two words: ""Walk out."" So I did.

Oddly enough, it felt lighter outside—like stepping out of a suffocating room you didn't realize was choking you. I headed to the canteen, grabbed a coffee, and casually asked the guy at the counter where people usually went to smoke. He pointed behind the building.

I walked over. The place was deserted. Just one guy—smoking and talking on the phone like the rest of the world didn't even exist. I gave him a small nod—the kind that says hello without expecting a reply. To my surprise, he nodded back and asked, ""Which branch?"" When I told him I was from Mechanical, he looked mildly surprised—he was from the same branch too.

But the real surprise came when I told him my name. ""Reyansh,"" I said. He blinked, then smiled. ""No way. My name's Reyansh too. Haven't seen you around."" ""Missed the first few months. Injury,"" I replied.

The more we talked, the more I realized—he was like a better version of me in almost everything: studies, sports, and especially in interacting with people and making friends. His full name was Reyansh Patel. He introduced me to a few other guys from the classroom—Dhruv, Vikram, Aayush, and a couple more. Most of them joked about me getting thrown out on my first day, but I didn't mind. After the kind of day I'd had, even that felt like a form of acceptance.

And just like that, what started as a horrific, humiliating catastrophe of a day ended with a bit of relief.",1,1757504470.0,indianwriters,0,1.0,False

A Doctor’s Guide to Maximum Absorption,"https://preview.redd.it/61yq9akvqbof1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=5fd6550557fba9cbea0c01e0807dcbb46560b52c

  
  
Hey everyone,

I was doing some research on why iron supplements sometimes don't seem to work as well as they should, and I found some info that was a game-changer for me. I figured I'd share it here since I know a lot of people supplement with iron.

The biggest mistake many of us make is taking our iron pill with our morning coffee, tea, or in a smoothie with milk or yogurt. It turns out, this is one of the worst things you can do.

The calcium in dairy and compounds called ""tannins"" in coffee/tea act as major ""blockers"" and can prevent your body from actually absorbing a huge percentage of the iron.

The simple, doctor-recommended fix is to:

1. **Pair it with Vitamin C.** A small glass of orange juice helps your body absorb the iron much more effectively.
2. **Time it right.** You need to wait at least **1-2 hours** *before or after* having any dairy, coffee, or tea to take your iron pill.

It's a small change but it can be the difference between the supplement working or not. **I learned most of this from a really clear guide that breaks down the science. It was super helpful for me, so I'll leave the link for anyone who wants to go deeper.** Hope this helps someone out!

**You can find the full guide here.**",1,1757504450.0,u_Supplement_Compass,0,1.0,False

It is not already in the billions(market cap would be higher than ETH for a 1000x) and chances are it is not in the hundreds of millions for similar reasons. However, it could be in the 10s of millions and chances are it probably is.

If we are going off past 1000x's we can narrow the coin down to those with insane hardworking communities, those who are changing the game. 

We see Doge, Shib, Pepe etc and see their success was due to their community efforts and other things but we do not see the fact that they were revolutionary at the time. Following previous footsteps and not innovating is not enough. A project must follow what works and then also build upon the glory of the predecessors. 

**To me the next 1000x is not just a coin that dominates social media, but they must also dominate somewhere else, imo this is IRL.**

This is why my pick for the next 1000x is **Kendu**

**How Kendu Is Dominating Social Media**

Kendu has an insane Reddit presence and can be seen on the altcoin subreddits, scrolling down the feed you're gonna see Kendu everywhere with unmatched engagement, we have the strongest presence on Reddit in the game rn. On Stocktwits and X we are also insanely strong with presence almost everywhere. We keep up with the best on these 2(even those with way higher market caps, this just shows truly how strong the Kendu community is. Our Telegram activity is actually insane as well beating SPX, Mog and Giga over weekly periods!

Yesterday Kendu won the CMC Boost Me competition and we got a shoutout to their 6 million followers on X! 

You can see it here: [https://x.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1964981653996175601](https://x.com/CoinMarketCap/status/1964981653996175601)

**How Kendu Is Dominating IRL and Improving On Previous 1000x's Efforts**

Kendu has over 20 IRL efforts and is literally making unprecedented progress, these initiatives are all pushed by the average holder too. Imagine the staggering wave of initiatives that will come at the higher levels so more investment can be made. You can also join and release your own creative dreams under the Kendu umbrella and receive 24/7 engagement.

Retail and investors in general are cautious about investing due to bad actors, but IRL shows that Kendu is different. We are building something physical with real people and this is the most ultimate form of **Proof Of Humanity.**

[Here's a Kendu chad\(Vortexian Party\) and his friend putting stickers around Cleveland!](https://preview.redd.it/1q0elhpnqbof1.png?width=959&format=png&auto=webp&s=b947c7cd6a14fc07a6ab36fb20bb7063e096e41c)

Here are Kendu's current IRL efforts(I might be forgetting some too):

* Kendu Coffee - A coffee company that sells both caffeinated and decaf coffee farmed in Brazil

People in love often say, “I love you to the moon and back.” But I can’t say the same because the distance results about 768,800 kilometres. And I could never put a number on what I feel for you  because it’s infinite.

My love isn’t about distance. It’s about presence. I want to show up when it’s hard, and stay when it gets messy.I love you without conditions, without pressure not just in the good, but especially when you need it most.

I want to remember the little things like your coffee order, the way you like your blanket tucked when you're tired,how you pause before answering when you’re deep in thought, the song you hum without realizing, and how your eyes light up when you talk about something you love.

I want to notice when your voice is a little quieter than usual, or when you need silence more than words. I want to be the one who sees the things you don’t say.

You could ask, “What would I do for you?”But my answer is simple: everything — even the things you’d never have to ask for.So maybe the real question is: What wouldn’t I do for you?

Because there is nothing I wouldn’t do for you.

My partner and I have 2 kids, 1 and 3. He works abroad 6 months out of the year and I’m a SAHM. When he’s home he’s helpful enough with keeping the house tidy and letting me sleep in some mornings but at the moment he’s working on our new house from 8am to 9pm as we have to vacate our current property by the end of this month. On top of that we live in his country and his family is MIA. So I have 0 help, ever. Unless you count the once a year I visit my family.

Normally I handle it. I wanted to be a very hands on parent. I cook from scratch, keep a clean and tidy home, activities, play dates, lots of reading, no TV, and my kids have a set bedtime. It works really well with my oldest but my youngest is absolutely wild. He’s still not walking, constantly cries to be in my arms, gets into absolutely everything, and doesn’t sleep through the night ever and will only take 1 short nap a day. I have found that I have 0 chill because of it. I get beyond frustrated and angry and just shout at minor things. 

This morning after yet another night of no sleep, no break, no help, I pop into the shower with my 2 in the bathroom. My oldest tells me she has to poo and it’s fine I’ll get out once she’s done even though I just got in. But then my youngest grabs my slipper and shoves it into the toilet. My eldest takes it out and flings it on my bathroom floor covered in pee and I completely lost it. I shouted as I got out the shower unwashed. All I needed to get through another day of hell was to be clean and have a coffee. My day spiraled from there and only got worse. I won’t bore anyone with the mundane but I am not handling this well. I am broken from lack of sleep, the constant crying that I just sit and ignore half the time now, the physical pain from carrying my youngest around all day, and his laying on me to breastfeed and torture me with his little hands. I’m at the lowest weight I’ve ever been (90lbs) and my shoulder and wrist joints pain me tremendously when weight is applied. 

I love my kids and they are always clean, well fed, and I’d like to think happy. But I’m miserable. I’ve spoken to my partner but he keeps telling me the house needs to be done. I’d get therapy but I can’t afford it right now. Any words of comfort welcome. ",6,1757504366.0,Parenting,8,1.0,False

A portal tears open with a faint pop, its edges glowing turquoise and purple, like someone spilled neon paint on reality. Out steps a human... or rather a girl, her heels tapping the ground with the kind of nonchalance that says, “Yep, just another day in the multiverse.”*

*Her dress, a long, curly, dark gray number with a slightly tattered hem, looks like it’s seen better days. The dull blue underside peeks through like a forgotten secret, while her scarf, a faded cyan mess of frayed edges and questionable stains, hangs loosely around her neck like it couldn’t be bothered to stay tied.*

*Her hair, a misty gray, falls just below her shoulders, topped off with a pair of wolf ears that twitch as if annoyed by the whole portal business. Her left eye is wrapped in a bloody bandage that’s seen more battles than a medieval knight, and her right eye — a dull, dark blue with shadows so deep they could double as a coffee addiction — scans the area with the enthusiasm of someone checking their spam folder.*

*Oh, and let’s not forget the halo. Or rather, the halo remnants. Floating above her head is a cracked, geometric mess of a halo, its pieces drifting lazily like they’re too tired to fully break away. It’s less “divine aura” and more “IKEA furniture assembled by a sleep-deprived college student.”*

*An assault rifle, which had seen better days, was slung over her shoulder and behind her back. The paint had long been scuffed and peeled off under countless scratches and chips, so that the old blue-and-white coloring was barely recognizable in it, the sight lens was cracked, and a worn inscription could be seen on the silencer, which was already impossible to read.*

*She glances back at the portal, which is now fizzling out like a dying firework.*

— Ugh, can these things ever drop me where I actually wanna go? Nah, that’d be too easy. Guess I’ll just add this to the list of ‘Places I Didn’t Ask to Be.’

*With a shrug, she adjusts her scarf and starts walking past stranger, her halo fragments bobbing along like they’re on a leisurely stroll.*

Based on my visits over the past several weeks, I have observed the following serious issues (see attached photos):
	•	Self-checkout screen: The same dirty stain has been present on the touchscreen for more than three weeks, showing a clear lack of cleaning and maintenance.
	•	Caulking: The caulk around fixtures is peeling and visibly growing mold, which is unsanitary and concerning for customer health.
	•	Coffee machine tip: The coffee dispenser tip is dirty and never cleaned, creating a major hygiene concern for anyone purchasing coffee.
	•	Creamer station: The station is covered in dust build-up, showing that it has not been properly wiped or maintained in a long time.

This level of neglect is far below the standards I expect from Wawa. The overall impression is unhygienic, unprofessional, and unsafe, and it reflects poorly on the Wawa brand.

I urge management to immediately address these issues with proper cleaning, maintenance, and supervision of staff to ensure customer safety and restore the reputation of Wawa.",0,1757503895.0,PhiladelphiaEats,14,0.17,False

1ndblms,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1ndblms/is_the_answer_always_v60/,Is the answer always V60?,"So I started my pourover journey in 2015 when I took out a subscription with Pact coffee in the UK and got a free V60 with my first order. At first I only had a blade grinder or would buy pre-ground coffee, I dont think I have a scale either. Using the Hoff's videos for help with technique I fumbled around not get great results but also not really knowing when a great cup was.  

After a while I started using a scale and timing my brews and it was clear that I couldn't not replicate what JH was doing (back then he only had his single cup video and I was trying to make a 2-cup) and when he released his french press guide I switched to that as my daily driver. 

Around 2020/21 I found my first really nice local coffee shop and realised what a good cup was actually like. It was also around this time my wife bought me a 1Zpresso JX. I was still using the french press but after getting chatty with the people in the coffee shop they recommended I try a Kalita so I got a 185 and at last I was able to make decent pourover at home. 

  
Since then my grinder has been upgraded to a Sculptor 064s and I've also switched to an Orea V3 (tried a Timemore B75 as well) after my glass Kalita smashed when I dropped it in the sink. Also since then I've found more great local coffee shops and tried numerous other when I've been away. Further understanding what is a great cup to me, experiencing lots of varieties of cofffee and improving my own technique at home.

  
Recently while in my local I remembered I was running low on wave filters at home but they didn't stock them. They did however sell V60 papers and it reminded me that my old freebie was still sat in the back of the cupboard at home. I knew how far my tools and technique have come since it would have last been used so out of curiosity I grabbed a pack of filters to give it a go again.

  
It took just a couple of attempts to dial the grindsize in I had a single cup that blew me away. The next day I did another V60 and an Orea side by side. They were both similar but the V60 was nicer - its cliche now I know but it was cleaner. I felt like I was tasting the coffee more and it reminded me more of whenever I've had a great filter cup at a coffee shop. The next day I tried a 2 cup with the only change being I coarsened the grind up 1 step on the sculptor and had brilliant results again.

  
I feel like I've been chasing these results for a long time and the answer was sat at the back of my cupboard the whole time. An £8 plastic dripper that I actually got for free. I could buy a different one for each day of the week for the price of an Orea V4.

  
tl;dr went back to V60 after \~5 years and its the best pourover coffee I've had.",13,1757503744.0,pourover,11,0.93,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

• Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements (about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However, the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days, and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

• During plasmapheresis, blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

• Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do. Donor identification systems are in place to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by your overall diet over several days, not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

The **OXO 13412400 Countertop Appliance Slider** is one of those rare items that combines practicality with elegance. Tested this product extensively, and while it’s not perfect, it certainly stands out in many ways. Sliding heavy appliances like a coffee maker or stand mixer across the countertop has never been so effortless. But as with any product, there are details worth discussing.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye was the tempered glass surface. It’s both sturdy and aesthetically pleasing, blending well with most kitchen setups. Plus, the anti-fingerprint coating was a game-changer. No one likes smudges on a clean countertop, and this feature keeps it looking pristine with minimal effort. With its dimensions of 9 x 14 inches and a slim profile of just 1.2 inches, it's compact enough to fit under most cabinets. Yet, despite its size, the slider can hold up to 35 pounds of appliances—something I truly appreciated when testing it with a hefty stand mixer.  

[Check OXO 13412400 Countertop Appliance Slider price on Amazon.](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0f3qt2q7c/)  

**Smooth Functionality**  
What makes this product shine is its ease of use. Pressing the easy-slide lever to move appliances across the countertop felt incredibly smooth. Unlike other solutions where you need brute force or excessive lifting, I found the braking mechanism engaging seamlessly. Release the lever, and the brake automatically locks the slider in place. It's particularly great for people like me who use multiple appliances daily and hate the hassle of moving them manually.  

**Merits**  
The standout features genuinely elevate the functionality of this device.  
- Tempered glass combined with a fingerprint-resistant coating for a premium look.  
- Holds up to 35 pounds, making it ideal for stand mixers and coffee grinders.  
- Easy press-and-release lever that’s intuitive and effortless to use.  
- Slim profile fits neatly under cabinets while remaining sleek on countertops.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
While I loved many aspects of this product, there are a few drawbacks worth mentioning.  
- The lever mechanism, although smooth, feels slightly stiff initially and requires a bit of pressure to activate.  
- The anti-fingerprint coating, while helpful, doesn't entirely prevent smudges from oily hands.  
- It would be great if larger versions were available for bulkier appliances.  

**Other Options in the Market**  
Before committing to this, I considered a few alternatives, like rolling mats and generic sliders. While they’re often cheaper, they don’t offer the same level of stability or brake mechanisms. Products like silicone sliders tend to stick over time, whereas the tempered glass on this appliance slider makes cleaning significantly easier. Compared to more robust appliance lifts, it lacks motorized aid but is far more budget-friendly and versatile.  

**Bang for the Buck**  
From a pricing perspective, this slider delivers good value for the features it offers. Its durability, coupled with its stellar design and functionality, makes it a worthwhile investment. Sure, you might find cheaper alternatives, but they usually sacrifice quality or convenience—a tradeoff that isn’t worth it, in my opinion.

Pale, deliberate, teeth sharp when he smiles. Vampiric. I nod politely. He does not return it.

I order two coffees. Steam curls around the mug like smoke from a candle. At the back window seat, one of the other customers shifts, scanning the room with eyes too sharp, shoulders too broad.

**Section 5: Valid Risks vs. Narrative Construction**

When you step back and look at the setup objectively, there *are* some real risks or open questions that investors should pay attention to with aTyr. But I think it's just as important to parse how the short reports frame these issues, and whether those narratives truly hold up under scrutiny.

**Key Risks or Uncertainties:**
- **Absence of a Major US/EU Pharma Partner:**  
  This does stand out for a company at this stage. While aTyr does have a credible, non-dilutive partnership with Kyorin in Japan, the lack of a Western Big Pharma tie-up leaves the company exposed if the Phase 3 readout is not a clean win. However, it’s also not unusual for rare disease biotechs pre-readout - many large partners want to see pivotal data before moving in. The fact that Kyorin committed pre–Phase 3 is arguably a positive sign in itself.

- **Phase 2 Data Limitations & the True Impact of COVID:**  
  The Phase 2 trial is often cited as ""underpowered"" or inconclusive, but the way I read it, this is at least partly a function of extraordinary circumstances. COVID shut down trial sites, forced dropouts (six of nine discontinuations were COVID-related), and led to missing spirometry data due to closed labs - these all tend to *dilute* potential drug-placebo separation, not inflate it. Notably, patients who got COVID often received high-dose steroids, pushing up average daily steroid doses and making the primary endpoint harder to hit. Yet despite this, the high-dose efzofitimod arm still managed to hit MCIDs on key patient-reported outcomes. In my view, this context is largely omitted or minimized in the bear narrative.

- **Insider Ownership and Direct Insider Buying:**  
  It’s fair to highlight that insider ownership sits at about 2–3%, which is on the low side for the sector, and that direct insider open-market buying has been minimal. However, there has been no notable insider selling either, and overall institutional ownership (by funds, crossovers, and passive indexers) is among the highest for a US biotech in this market cap range. I think the bigger signal here is the high level of “sticky hands” and real-money ownership, not the lack of director buying.

- **Dilution, ATM Risk, and Funding Needs:**  
  Dilution is a genuine risk in any pre-commercial biotech, especially if the company plans to launch solo. However, it’s important to note that aTyr’s Kyorin partnership in Japan could unlock $155M+ in non-dilutive milestone payments if successful, and the strong cash position after the recent ATM raise (plus potential new ex-US deals) could offset the need for heavy dilution post-readout. If the data disappoints, dilution risk obviously goes up, but this is no different from virtually every other clinical-stage company in this cohort.

- **Track Record of Asset Pivots / Pipeline Breadth:**  
  Some reports argue that aTyr’s history of shifting focus (from other rare diseases to sarcoidosis, etc.) is a negative. In reality, the company has maintained a consistent focus on tRNA synthetase biology, with efzofitimod as the current lead but with a clear platform approach and a real preclinical pipeline. Yes, efzofitimod is the make-or-break near-term event, but it’s not a “one-trick pony” company in the literal sense. In fact, the success of efzofitimod would likely create a halo effect for the platform, repricing the entire pipeline.

**How the Bear Reports Construct Their Narrative:**
Looking at these reports side-by-side, what stands out to me is how the negatives are often framed in isolation, stripped of sector context, or shaped by omission:
- COVID is treated as a confounder, but not as a factor that would have made it *harder* to show benefit.
- Low insider ownership is amplified, with little attention to the very high fund and passive index ownership.
- Dilution risk is highlighted, but the milestone structure of the Kyorin deal and financial discipline post-ATM aren’t given fair weight.
- Asset pivots are portrayed as evidence of desperation rather than as part of the normal biotech evolution process.
- There’s little acknowledgment of the real external validation (Science Translational Medicine publication, repeated DSMB reviews, regulatory alignment, and high-conviction institutional ownership).

All told, these are real risks and they should be considered, but I think the way they are presented is designed to feed a bearish narrative. It’s the selective context, omission of mitigating factors, and reframing of sector-standard dynamics as uniquely problematic that, in my experience, is the real “tell” of a bear campaign heading into a binary event.

---

**Section 6: Bear Playbook - Narrative Structure & Tactics**

From my perspective, the most valuable thing readers can take from these clustered reports is how to recognize the common playbook of a pre-catalyst bear campaign. These reports are textbook in their use of several recurring tactics:

- **Omission and Selective Framing:**  
  Often, the reports focus on risks or “red flags” without reference to sector norms or the company’s real mitigating factors (e.g., presenting low insider ownership as damning without noting high passive/active fund concentration).

- **Anchoring and Repetition:**  
  Specific negative points - like “no Big Pharma partner” or “underpowered Phase 2” - are repeated throughout the report, sometimes in slightly different language, to anchor readers to those concerns even if the actual data is more nuanced.

- **Overemphasis on Narrative Themes:**  
  The reports tend to amplify worst-case scenarios, or present potential negatives as though they are inevitable, e.g., assuming ATM use means “dilution at any cost” rather than strategic financial flexibility.

- **Ignoring Contradictory Evidence:**  
  Some of the best external validations (e.g., Science Translational Medicine paper, four clean DSMB reviews, regulatory clarity) get little more than a mention, if anything.

- **Cherry-Picking of Prior Asset History:**  
  Asset pivots are presented as a negative, with no context given to the company’s evolving strategy or normal pipeline pruning in the sector.

- **Use of Anonymous Sources or Unverifiable Claims:**  
  Reports sometimes cite unattributed “experts” or vague claims about management or science that can’t be checked or refuted.

- **Heightened Emotional Tone or Loaded Language:**  
  Even when aiming for an “objective” style, many of these reports lean into emotive or rhetorical language (“one drug, one shot, one shelf too many”), which is a classic tell in the space.

If you’re new to biotech, these are classic pre-catalyst bear moves, and they’re not unique to ATYR. The setup is all about shaping sentiment and perception right before a binary event, especially when the tape is tight and shorts are crowded.

**A brief note on the bull side:**  
To be balanced, I’d add that the bull camp is not immune from hype or wishful thinking, either. In high-volatility setups like this, you’ll see bullish voices projecting outsized targets, ignoring real risks, or dismissing critical questions too quickly. That’s why, for both sides, it’s critical to ground every claim in fact, and to recognize when emotion or narrative is taking the driver’s seat.

---

**Section 7: My Synthesis and Takeaways**

Having now reviewed all three bear reports in close detail, I think the real takeaway here is how powerful narrative construction can be - especially in the lead-up to a high-profile binary readout. It’s not about dismissing risk or pretending there are no real concerns; it’s about weighing what’s truly material, what’s sector-standard, and what’s simply noise amplified for effect. Here’s how I’m synthesizing the substance, the gaps, and the genuine signals as we approach the readout.

**The way I see it, here’s what stands out:**

- *Most of the risks raised - like lack of Big Pharma partner, dilution risk, and the “underpowered” Phase 2 - are common to almost every late-stage, pre-commercial biotech, and shouldn’t be read as unique red flags.*
    - The Kyorin partnership, for example, is a significant real-world validation. Not only is Kyorin a commercial player in Japan, but it also has up to $155 million in regulatory and sales milestones on the table, plus double-digit royalties. This is not the “no partner” scenario that typically haunts binary biotechs.
    - The company’s recent ATM usage does increase dilution risk, but aTyr’s cash position - over $80M as of the last quarterly filing, with more likely raised since - genuinely extends runway through the binary. Additional non-dilutive capital from Kyorin remains a possibility if milestones are triggered.
    - The platform angle (tRNA synthetase biology) is not a hand-wave; Science Translational Medicine just published detailed mechanistic and translational work, and ATYR0101 is now formally in the IND candidate stage, with another (ATYR0750) advancing for liver disorders.
    - Short interest and options market data suggest that the float remains exceptionally tight, with over 20M shares short and heavy OI at near-term strikes - raising the probability of outsized price moves, up or down, at readout.
- *COVID’s impact on the Phase 2 trial is persistently underplayed in these bear reports.* 
    - Nearly 1 in 4 patients dropped out, most due to pandemic-related site closures.
    - Steroid dose inflation from COVID treatment protocols may have masked steroid-sparing signals, especially in an already small study.
    - Despite these headwinds, the high-dose arm cleared minimal clinically important differences (MCID) on KSQ endpoints.
    - I see the move to a much larger (n=268), post-pandemic, FDA-endpoint-clarified Phase 3 as a major upgrade in trial rigor and signal-to-noise ratio.

**What, if anything, changes in my view?**
- The lack of a major US or EU pharma partner does remain a real risk *if* the data is marginal or the company struggles to commercialize directly. That said, the Kyorin deal at least de-risks the Japan/Asia commercial story.
- Dilution is an ever-present risk, and aTyr has been upfront about using the ATM. But in context, many biotechs run at the edge of cash runway before their pivotal readouts. Any deal with Kyorin or a positive data readout could change that calculus overnight.
- The bear case that “asset pivots” are a sign of desperation doesn’t fully land for me. aTyr has retired legacy programs and focused on efzofitimod, but there is clear ongoing investment in next-gen pipeline assets. This is consistent with how most small biotechs operate pre-commercialization.
- The single-asset perception is real, and it does heighten binary risk, but there’s at least a plausible path to multi-asset value creation if efzofitimod works.

**Risks vs. Reality Table**

| Shorts Say                                       | Evidence Says                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No Big Pharma partner is a red flag              | Kyorin partnership is real, with large milestones and royalties; US/EU open post-data|
| Phase 2 inconclusive/underpowered                | True, but COVID impact, dropout rate, and MCID signals are underweighted            |
| Insider ownership is low                         | True, but institutional/passive ownership and retail concentration are unusual      |
| Dilution is coming                               | ATM used, but cash runway extended, non-dilutive Kyorin funding still in play       |
| Asset pivots = desperation                       | Normal pre-commercial evolution; pipeline broadening (ATYR0101, ATYR0750, oncology) |

**Points That Change vs. Points That Don’t**

*Shifts in my view:*
- I have increased respect for the dilution and commercial launch risks if the data is only “good not great.”
- I see slightly more reason to track any new US/EU partnership chatter, or lack thereof, post-readout.

*Points that don’t change:*
- My conviction that the float and market structure are highly asymmetric, with a meaningful chance of nonlinear price action at readout.
- The science and mechanistic story are the strongest I’ve seen in a microcap in years, and Kyorin’s vote of confidence is not trivial.
- The main determinant remains the Phase 3 data and post-readout strategic activity, not pre-catalyst bear/bull narrative wars.

**Summary Table: Shorts Say / Evidence Says**

| Shorts Say                                       | Evidence Says                                                                      |
|--------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No Big Pharma partner is a red flag              | Kyorin partnership is real, with large milestones and royalties; US/EU open post-data|
| Phase 2 inconclusive/underpowered                | True, but COVID impact, dropout rate, and MCID signals are underweighted            |

| Asset pivots = desperation                       | Normal pre-commercial evolution; pipeline broadening (ATYR0101, ATYR0750, oncology) |

**Final Takeaway**

Ultimately, I don’t see anything in these bear reports that genuinely moves my probability of success for the upcoming binary event. The market structure remains the wild card, and the real signal will be in the data and any subsequent strategic moves. In this sort of high-stakes setup, the best you can do is to keep challenging your assumptions, look past the narrative churn, and stay focused on the evolving evidence.

**Section 8: What to Watch for Next**

Looking forward, the next few weeks are about as pivotal as it gets for $ATYR. With the Phase 3 readout looming, all eyes are on every signal in the market. Here’s what I’m focused on:

- **Readout Timing:**  
  - Company guidance remains “mid-September.” My own hypothesis is that we’ll see topline data released around September 16. However, I could be wrong - there’s every chance they wait to unveil key details at ERS (European Respiratory Society) on September 30, especially if they want a splash at the late-breaking abstract.  
  - What I’m watching for: sudden news releases, SEC filings, or changes in messaging that could front-run the data. If nothing appears by September 16–18, I’d lean toward ERS as the major reveal.

- **Tape Action & Order Book:**  
  - Recently, the tape has been extremely tight, with most trading locked in a narrow $5.30–$5.50 band. Underlying this is constant shorting and some day-to-day churn, but very little true selling from high-conviction holders.
  - A sharp move on low volume - either up or down—would likely mean short covering, gamma hedging, or someone getting run over. If liquidity vanishes and the price jumps, that’s your classic “order book air pocket” scenario in a coiled tape.

- **Short Interest & Covering:**  
  - Short interest remains at or near record highs. Borrow rates, locate difficulties, and off-exchange shorting are all signals worth monitoring closely. A sudden drop in available shares to short or a spike in borrow costs could be a real tell that shorts are getting nervous.
  - Pre-catalyst covering is possible, but with so much conviction and size out there, forced covering post-readout remains the key risk/reward driver.

- **Options Expiry & Open Interest:**  
  - September 19th is a huge monthly expiry. If the catalyst lands before then, the scramble to re-hedge or cover could create outsized volatility, especially at crowded strikes. If it’s after expiry, the focus shifts to October and January contracts, but the mechanical setup remains highly leveraged in both directions.

- **Retail & Community Dynamics:**  
  - The high-conviction retail base - particularly those posting positions on Reddit and Discord—remains a real constraint on supply. I’m watching for new high-profile posts, sentiment shifts, or waves of retail FOMO/panic that could tip the balance.
  - Institutional behavior will be hard to read until post-catalyst, but watch for block trades and abnormal tape prints as a potential signal of positioning changes.

- **Management Signals & Governance:**  
  - Don’t expect management to say much now, as this is peak regulatory risk period. Any unexpected communication - be it filings, option exercises, or late-breaking interviews—will be notable.
  - Any signs of insider activity, large-scale exercises, or filings would get my attention.

- **M&A, Partnerships, and Strategic Activity:**  
  - Any rumors, block trades, or unusual dark pool prints could signal strategic interest. After a positive readout, potential milestones from Kyorin (Japan partner) and non-dilutive funding options may become relevant.  
  - Watch for whispers of licensing or M&A activity post-catalyst, especially if the data are strong.

- **Key Dates to Track:**  
  - September 16–18: Anticipated window for topline data (if they release before ERS)
  - September 19: Major options expiry
  - September 30: ERS Congress, late-breaking abstract session
  - Continuous: Tape behavior, options flow, short interest, management filings

The kind where the sky turns that odd shade of blue-gray, and the streets smell like wet cement. I had stayed late at the bookstore where I worked, reorganizing a shelf that didn’t need reorganizing, mostly to avoid the silence of my apartment.

That’s when I saw her.

She was sitting on the front steps of the shop across the street. No umbrella, no jacket. Just a red dress that clung to her like the rain wanted to keep her for itself. Her hair was soaked, and she didn’t seem to care. She just sat there, staring up at the sky like it was telling her a secret.

I don’t know what made me cross the street. Maybe it was the way she looked lost and found all at once. Maybe it was because she didn’t flinch at the thunder.

“Hey,” I said. “You okay?”

She turned to me slowly, blinking water out of her eyes. “Do you ever feel like you’re the only one not in on the joke?”

It wasn’t what I expected. But somehow, it made sense.

I offered her the umbrella I hadn’t even opened. She didn’t take it, but she stood up. “I missed my train,” she said, as if that explained everything.

“I make a mean cup of instant coffee,” I offered.

She smiled. “I don’t even know your name.”

“I’m Nate.”

“Hi, Nate,” she said, like it wasn’t raining between us. “I’m Lila.”

She came with me to the shop. I unlocked the back door and we sat behind the counter, sharing a dusty packet of instant coffee and talking about nothing. Her laugh had this quiet honesty to it, the kind that made you want to earn it again.

At some point, she told me she had just gotten out of a long relationship. Seven years. “I don’t know who I am without him,” she said.

I didn’t try to fix her. I just listened. We both watched the rain until it stopped.

Before she left, I asked if she’d come by again.

She looked at me like she was measuring the weight of the question. “Maybe,” she said. “If it rains.”

It did. Three days later.

She showed up, umbrella still closed.

And I’ve been waiting for the rain ever since.",2,1757502396.0,story,0,1.0,False

*China’s near-monopoly on critical mineral tilting military chip balance while US desperately seeks alternative supplies*

[China's gallium grip squeezing and eroding US military's edge - Asia Times](https://asiatimes.com/2025/09/chinas-gallium-grip-squeezing-and-eroding-us-militarys-edge/)

[China has a near-monopoly on gallium. Image: X Screengrab](https://preview.redd.it/hnmokvs17bof1.png?width=1024&format=png&auto=webp&s=59970a73892dc8547181678b05f8acf1e652da99)

China’s chokehold on gallium is quietly rewriting the rules of the arms race, leaving the US scrambling to keep its military electronics—and its edge—switched on. While the US remains the world leader in overall defense spending and innovation, China’s grip on gallium highlights how supply chain bottlenecks can offset traditional advantages.

This month, the South China Morning Post (SCMP) [reported](https://www.scmp.com/news/china/science/article/3324489/chinas-silent-sanction-us-semiconductors-creates-weapons-generation-gap?share=UZnRSlzz1V%2BVdmjGKsI5uE8G8KX9LVGw8FZzI6expT2iIXJilC0CsL80BHpsHOvS5bAWurhmAHPG2aof5MD64kwRGsHb0mQy9zC918qmG1o%3D&utm_campaign=social_share) that China has quietly imposed de facto sanctions on the US semiconductor industry by restricting exports of critical minerals such as gallium and germanium. This move has widened the technological gap in military radar systems.

The shift was underscored during a military parade in Tiananmen Square, where China unveiled advanced weapons powered by gallium nitride (GaN) semiconductors. According to a report by the Chinese Academy of Sciences’ Institute of Physics, China’s dominance in GaN technology—used in phased array radar—has enabled rapid deployment of compact, high-performance systems across its armed forces.

While the US pioneered active electronically scanned array (AESA) radar, its naval fleet still relies heavily on older systems, with only recent upgrades to SPY-6 AESA on select destroyers. China’s strategic control over GaN production, bolstered by its near-monopoly on refined gallium and a mature industrial chain, has allowed it to integrate military and civilian applications, accelerating innovation and reducing costs.

The export controls, framed as national security measures, were reaffirmed in December 2024. Analysts say this silent sanction has reshaped the global arms race, with China now fielding radar networks capable of detecting stealth aircraft and ballistic missiles at a scale the US could not match.

Aidan Power-Riggs and others, in a July 2025 [report](https://www.csis.org/analysis/beyond-rare-earths-chinas-growing-threat-gallium-supply-chains#:~:text=chips%20has%20enabled%20smaller%20radar,to%20name%20just%20a%20few) for the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), note that China controls 98% of global gallium production, leveraging its dominance in aluminum refining and proprietary extraction technologies to weaponize supply chains amid escalating trade tensions.

They emphasize that China’s export restrictions, tightened since 2023, have evolved into a comprehensive embargo targeting the US, disrupting access to gallium, a critical component for defense systems.

With over 11,000 US military components dependent on gallium and 85% involving Chinese suppliers, they caution that a chokehold poses a strategic threat to US national security and allied defense readiness.

China’s control over gallium, germanium, and other rare-earth exports is unlikely to cripple the US military outright. Still, it could significantly affect US arms exports by increasing the already high cost of its military equipment and stretching production times. This would likely result in smaller arms purchases and longer delivery times in arming partners such as Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan, possibly undermining their military capabilities.

Still, the US has found ways to circumvent these export controls. Sara Godek, in a March 2025 Stimson [article](https://www.stimson.org/2025/chinas-germanium-and-gallium-export-restrictions-consequences-for-the-united-states/), observes that despite China’s official ban on gallium and germanium exports to the US, both materials continue to reach the latter’s shores via indirect trade routes.

She points to trade data showing that third countries—especially Belgium—serve as conduits, with Chinese exports of germanium to Belgium surging 224% in 2024, mirroring the decline in direct US exports and suggesting a rerouted supply.

She says gallium reexports are harder to trace, but increased imports from Germany and Canada—both of which rely on Chinese supply and recycling—reveal similar patterns. These backdoor flows, Godek argues, undermine China’s restrictions and sustain US consumption despite a 68–77% drop in direct imports.

Yet such workarounds are only stopgaps. Alvin Camba, [writing](https://warontherocks.com/2025/04/a-federal-critical-mineral-processing-initiative-securing-u-s-mineral-independence-from-china/#:~:text=2010%2C%20China%20restricted%20rare%20earth,The%20United%20States%20also) in War on the Rocks in April 2025, notes that the US has reopened the Mountain Pass Rare Earth Mine, utilizing the Defense Production Act to fund select domestic projects and expanding the budgets of the Department of Defense (DoD) and the Department of Energy (DoE) to support mining and processing.

Camba adds that the US has also pursued “friendshoring” partnerships with allies such as Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea to diversify its supply chains. Despite those efforts, he points out that domestic refining remains limited, with new facilities taking 10–20 years to become operational, a challenge compounded by investor hesitancy, high capital costs, and environmental opposition.

Beyond these obstacles, Camba says China’s integrated supply chain and its ability to manipulate global mineral markets—for instance, by flooding them with supply to depress prices—further undermine US competitiveness. Camba also notes that reopened US mines still rely heavily on Chinese processing. Moreover, he adds that US allies face their own capacity constraints and geopolitical vulnerabilities, leaving stockpiling an expensive and insufficient fallback.

That leaves another, riskier path: investing in countries with significant rare-earth reserves. As Elly Rostoum notes in a June 2025 [article](https://cepa.org/article/rare-earths-can-we-de-risk-from-china/) for the Center for European Policy Analysis (CEPA), while the US has invested US$600 billion in rare-earth-related infrastructure abroad, it is unlikely to shoulder the enormous cost of fully de-risking from China—estimated between $590 billion and more than $2 trillion by 2040.

She also argues that pouring money into far-flung mines may not be the ideal solution from a security standpoint.

Rostoum highlights that US companies are bound by prohibitions against investing in authoritarian or democratically challenged countries, in contrast to China’s pragmatic approach, which often ignores corruption or human rights concerns.

Rostoum notes that China has shown a greater appetite for risky investment, paying out $391 billion in troubled loans since 2005. Although many of these loans may never be repaid, Rostoum adds, they enabled China to gain a foothold in new markets and develop the infrastructure and networks necessary to control future supply chains.

In addition, while the US and China compete for rare earth supplies, Rostoum points out that source countries in the Global South are nationalizing reserves, recognizing their strategic importance as bargaining chips to secure better diplomatic, economic or security deals with the two superpowers.

At the same time, China’s strategy carries its own vulnerabilities, from reliance on politically volatile suppliers to the long-term risks of unsustainable lending. Such risks include reputational damage, resentment in indebted states that are unable to repay, reduced resources for China’s domestic priorities, and borrowers turning to Western alternatives.

Additionally, the risk of mutually assured economic damage from China’s export controls on rare earth metals and the US’s restrictions on advanced AI chips may incentivize both sides to dial down tensions. Just as the US depends on China’s rare earth metals for cutting-edge semiconductors and military gear, China’s AI industry still relies on US chips to support its ambitions.

In a contest where minerals are as valuable as missiles, China’s grip on gallium underscores that the arms race is being fought not only on battlefields but also in supply chains. For both China and the US, victory may hinge less on firepower than on which side can keep its factories and militaries running.

# SEPT. 9th, 2025~Payne Institute 2025 State of Critical Minerals Report: How processing and recovery can strengthen U.S. mineral security

***Annual report highlights potential of recycling and mining byproducts to meet U.S. critical mineral demand***

[Payne Institute 2025 State of Critical Minerals Report: How processing and recovery can strengthen U.S. mineral security | Colorado School of Mines | Newsroom](https://www.minesnewsroom.com/news/payne-institute-2025-state-critical-minerals-report-how-processing-and-recovery-can-strengthen)

[Morgan Bazilian, director of the Payne Institute of Public Policy, speaks during the launch event for the 2025 State of Critical Minerals Report in Washington, D.C. ](https://preview.redd.it/i680e7eg8bof1.png?width=1560&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f5a62d16ca5591b0e1d83153c1f55c4a8fffd82)

The [Payne Institute for Public Policy](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/) at Colorado School of Mines today released its [2025 State of Critical Minerals Report](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/149/2025/08/Payne-Institute-The-State-of-Critical-Minerals-Report-2025.pdf), underscoring opportunities to strengthen U.S. mineral security through smarter investment in refining, processing, byproduct recovery, and recycling.

The demand for [critical minerals](https://www.mines.edu/critical-minerals-research/) is only expected to grow as the U.S. increasingly relies on minerals for high-tech weaponry, artificial intelligence and data centers, electric vehicles and a diverse mix of power generation technologies. The report notes that some of the best opportunities come not from developing new mines alone, but from extracting more from current mining operations and expanding processing capacity in the U.S.

“There are relatively small volumes of material with outsized importance,” said [Morgan Bazilian](https://payneinstitute.mines.edu/director/), director of the Payne Institute. “That means targeted action—on workforce, investment, and markets—can deliver supply quickly, affordably, and with big security benefits.” 

The report highlights how strategic regulation and investment can help accelerate these solutions. In addition to supporting specific projects, government action can foster the creation of transparent marketplaces for critical minerals—improving price discovery, reducing transaction costs, and helping attract private capital into the sector.

“This year’s *State of Critical Minerals* report considers the potential offered across these themes. And, as always, we are proud to showcase the leading research and workforce development being done by the extraordinary, interdisciplinary teams at Colorado School of Mines,” said Bazilian.

# Key Findings from the 2025 Report

* **No Minerals, No Megawatts.** Shortages in just 13 minerals could force a swing in deployment of power generation technologies by 25 percent or more.
* **Byproduct Recovery.** The U.S. could cease importing 27 critical minerals altogether if 10 percent or less of the estimated available resources of those minerals could be recovered (and processed) from ongoing U.S. mining operations.
* **Recycling Potential.** The U.S. exports one-third of its copper demand in the form of scrap. Retaining and recycling that copper could cut import dependence from nearly half of supply to less than 15 percent.
* **Smaller Volumes, Lower Costs.** U.S. annual gallium needs could be met with less than $15 million in federal support—illustrating how small investments can yield significant security benefits.
* **Government-Supported Marketplaces.** Of the 50 minerals on the U.S. Geological Survey’s critical list, 42 are not traded on exchanges. Creating marketplaces could improve transparency and reduce risk, making it easier for buyers and sellers to transact.

# 🚨 NioCorp: The Perfect Storm is Forming 🚨

# IMHO~ The last 10 days have shifted NioCorp from “long-term story” to imminent inflection point. Look at what’s lining up:

**1. DoD / Navarro Mid-September Meeting**  
The Pentagon is reviewing *critical minerals price supports* — the exact playbook NioCorp needs. **With Scandium, Niobium, and Titanium all top-10 on the USGS critical list, Elk Creek isn’t just relevant — it’s the poster child. Price floors + Title III/DPA programs = supply chain certainty**.

**2. Mark Smith’s Gen VI Fighter Bombshell**  
On Monday Sept. 8th Wainwright event\~ Mark confirmed NioCorp is **actively working with a DoD prime** on Scandium-Aluminum alloys for **6th generation fighters.** That’s not hypothetical anymore — it’s being written into the bill of materials. This is Pentagon-level validation that Elk Creek will be the **supply gatekeeper.** Gen VI fighters, drones, and sensor arrays **will** ***literally fly on Scandium! \*\*\*\****

**3. RedChip Delay = Signal, Not Noise**  
*Originally set for Sept 11th, the RedChip webinar was quietly moved to Sept 24th — right after the DoD’s price-support meeting*???? That’s not random. **It signals management wants to present with fresh ammo:** whether that’s a DoD-linked partnership, offtake progress, or early drill visuals, they’re setting up for a bigger stage!!

**4. Timing into Drill Results & DFS**  
With assays expected mid–late October and “first scandium metal” DoD demo by November, we’re entering a stacked catalyst window. Elk Creek’s expansion drilling could boost outputs 50%+ across Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs, with DFS following right behind.

**IMHO \~ Following Monday's Wainwright presentation, NioCorp has entered its most pivotal phase yet.** Mark Smith confirmed Phase 1 drilling is complete with assays expected mid-to-late October, paving the way for a resource update and a Q4 Definitive Feasibility Study that could reset the scale across scandium, niobium, titanium, and rare earths. At the same time, titanium negotiations with three major U.S. players are advancing, Stellantis is engaged on REEs, and two scandium metal demonstration paths with DoD are underway — with first scandium metal targeted for November. ***Most significant: confirmation that a DoD prime is working directly with NioCorp on Sc-Al alloys for Gen VI fighter jets, marking Elk Creek as a true defense cornerstone!***

Strategically, the project now carries momentum few peers can match. Elk Creek is backed by a $10M DoD Title III award, ongoing EXIM Bank financing engagement, and recognition across the CHIPS Act, DOE’s $1B critical minerals program, and DPA mandates. The Pentagon’s growing validation of scandium’s role in next-gen systems — lightweighting alloys that extend range, double threat detection, and enable 360° pilot awareness — cements NioCorp’s status as the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium” and the Pentagon’s next DFARS supplier. With Ernest Cleave now driving financing and offtake strategy, the shift from development to execution is clearly accelerating.

Looking forward, the **RedChip presentation — now rescheduled to Sept. 24th at 4:15PM EST — raises eyebrows**! Why the two-week push? In this context, it’s hard not to suspect that management wanted more visibility to line up with key catalysts: drilling results, resource expansion, or even a partnership reveal.

With offtakes and DoD ties already in motion, Elk Creek is no longer “just a mine-in-the-making” — it is fast becoming the flagship U.S. critical minerals project, uniquely positioned to deliver Sc, Nb, Ti, and REEs at scale. By 2028, NioCorp may well redefine America’s resource independence, —

# Why Voice Search Matters in Digital Marketing

Voice search is reshaping the digital landscape, with millions of users relying on voice-activated devices to find products, services, and information. Whether it’s asking Google Assistant for nearby restaurants or instructing Alexa to order groceries, voice search offers unparalleled convenience. According to recent studies, over 50% of global internet users now use voice search regularly, and this number is expected to grow even further in 2025. For marketers, adapting to **voice search marketing trends** is essential to remain visible in an increasingly competitive space. But how can businesses prepare for this vocal revolution? Let’s dive into the state of voice search in 2025 and uncover strategies to optimize your online presence.

# The Current State of Voice Search in 2025

As of 2025, voice search has reached new heights, driven by advancements in AI and widespread adoption of smart devices. Here are some key statistics and trends shaping the landscape:

* **Device Penetration**: Over 75% of households in developed countries own at least one smart speaker, with Amazon Echo and Google Home leading the market (Source: Statista, 2025).
* **Usage Growth**: Voice search queries account for nearly 40% of all searches on Google, a significant jump from just 20% in 2020 (Source: Google Trends, 2025).
* **Mobile Dominance**: With the rise of smartphones, more than 60% of voice searches are performed on mobile devices, highlighting the need for mobile-first optimization.
* **Younger Demographics**: Millennials and Gen Z are the primary users of voice search, often using it for quick answers, local business searches, and e-commerce.

These numbers underscore a clear message: ignoring **voice search optimization 2025** is no longer an option for businesses aiming to capture modern audiences. The technology is here to stay, and its integration into daily life will only deepen.

# Key Strategies for Voice SEO in 2025

To succeed in the era of voice search, businesses must rethink their SEO approach. Unlike traditional text-based searches, voice queries are conversational, often longer, and intent-driven. Here are some proven **voice SEO strategies** to implement:

# 1. Focus on Conversational Keywords

Voice searches mimic natural speech patterns. Instead of typing “best pizza NYC,” users might ask, “Where can I find the best pizza in New York City?” Optimize your content for these long-tail, question-based keywords. Use tools like AnswerThePublic or Google’s “People Also Ask” feature to identify common queries.

# 2. Prioritize Local SEO

A significant portion of voice searches are location-specific, such as “Find a coffee shop near me.” Ensure your business is listed on Google My Business with accurate details (address, phone number, hours). Encourage customer reviews and use local keywords to improve visibility in “near me” searches.

# 3. Optimize for Mobile

Since most voice searches occur on smartphones, your website must be mobile-friendly. Focus on fast loading times, responsive design, and easy navigation. Google’s Mobile-First Indexing prioritizes mobile-optimized sites, so this is non-negotiable for **voice search optimization 2025**.

# 4. Create FAQ Content

Voice assistants often pull answers from FAQ pages or structured content. Develop comprehensive FAQ sections on your website that address common customer questions in a clear, concise manner. Use schema markup to help search engines understand and prioritize your content.

# 5. Aim for Featured Snippets

Voice assistants frequently read answers from Google’s featured snippets (Position 0). Structure your content to provide direct, succinct answers to popular queries. Use bullet points, numbered lists, and clear headings to increase your chances of being featured.

By adopting these strategies, businesses can position themselves to capture the growing wave of voice search traffic and stay relevant in 2025.

# How AI Enhances Voice Search Experiences

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the backbone of modern voice search technology. From natural language processing (NLP) to machine learning, **AI in voice search** enables devices to understand user intent, interpret accents, and deliver personalized results. Here’s how AI is revolutionizing the voice search landscape:

* **Improved Accuracy**: AI algorithms continuously learn from user interactions, making voice assistants better at understanding complex queries over time.
* **Contextual Understanding**: Thanks to NLP, voice assistants can interpret follow-up questions and maintain conversational context, enhancing user experience.
* **Personalization**: AI analyzes user behavior to provide tailored recommendations, such as suggesting nearby restaurants based on past searches.
* **Voice Commerce**: AI-driven voice search is fueling e-commerce growth, with platforms like Amazon integrating seamless purchasing options via voice commands.

# Challenges Businesses Face with Voice Search Adoption

Despite its potential, adopting voice search optimization isn’t without hurdles. Businesses must navigate several challenges to fully embrace this technology:

* **Lack of Expertise**: Many companies lack the technical know-how to implement **voice SEO strategies**, leading to missed opportunities.
* **Privacy Concerns**: Users are increasingly wary of data collection by voice assistants, which can impact adoption rates and trust in voice-driven services.
* **Content Adaptation**: Traditional SEO content doesn’t always translate well to voice search, requiring a shift toward conversational, user-focused writing.
* **Competition for Visibility**: With voice search often delivering a single result (e.g., the top answer), ranking high is more critical—and competitive—than ever.

Overcoming these challenges requires a strategic approach and the right partner. That’s where [hiphype.co](http://hiphype.co) comes in.

## Work Updates


Shortly after my [last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/patches765/comments/ud7hyz/life_a_little_easter_magic/), I got a formal promotion at work, followed by a rapid succession of re-orgs (seriously, far too many) that honestly made my head spin. When the dust settled, I ended up multiple tiers higher, doing work that I loved, and no longer under the thumb of managers on power trips (they are now gone). Downside - I now have on-call rotation every few months. Considering how badly on-call was abused in the past, it was refreshing to see it (mostly) used properly. Until recently, I have been swamped trying to keep up with the changes. We have been assured that the rapid changes have settled and we are now where management wants us to be. Some interesting highlights:

* One-on-one meeting with a VP for the sole purpose of getting to know me.  
* Attending breakfast and lunch invites with middle and upper management.  
* Attended a convention for network engineers on the company's dime.  

Above all, been busy, busy, busy. Insanely busy. My schedule has only stabilized this past week where I don't feel like I am treading water anymore trying to stay afloat. I am finally ahead of things and actually have spare time again.   

## Gaming  


SWTOR (Star Wars: The Old Republic) made some changes early last year. First, they revamped the class system - not in a good way, and then the graphics. My computer started having problems running it smoothly. Finally, they realeased the Date Night expansion (I am serious - they did an expansion to do virtual dates). Not the game I wanted to play. So, stopped playing it.  

Minecraft - I still bounce around modpacks, but mainly focus on two now. E2E with a few additions, and E6E/E6 (I recently changed to just E6 since I want to relax, not stress myself) also with a few additions. 

$Wifie got my to start playing EverQuest again. I agreed, with some conditions. I would be creating a new character, and she was not to tell anyone who I was. My old character is still fairly well known even though I hadn't played for years, and I just wanted to play - not answer non-stop questions about what I have been up to, or invites to places when I just wanted to relax. My new character, who I won't be sharing the name of here, is focusing on crafting. Yes, I will spend hours fishing, or baking, or brewing... whatever I feel like at the moment (currently I am focusing on jewelry making). $Wifie also created a new character that is a secret, and we present ourselves as sisters. I've got some funny stories on that.  


We still do the weekly D&D game every Thursday, but the group has changed a bit. I am currently running them through GDQ1-7 from 2nd edition (converted to 5th) and they are having a blast. I need to document some stories of the gaming since then. There were two Friday games. $Squire's was my favorite, but he started a new job (that he loves) and it ended with me flying into the sunset - so I am good with closure there. I just miss it because the group was awesome, and $Squire is an amazing DM. I replaced with this a game $Spy invited me to, but didn't stick with it - the vibe was off - not sure how to describe it. It has completely fallen apart because apparently I picked up on something that took a bit longer for others to realize. $Wife and I meet up with $Spy on a regular basis for coffee (they are considered one of our adopted kids).  

## Family  

Lots of updates here. $Son and $Daughter are doing well - both focusing on work and education. $Daughter is probably going to be the first doctor in the family and I couldn't be more proud. $Son has expressed interest in meteorology and has started working towards that goal. (This totally tracks with his interests when he was younger and I am happy to see him passionate about something again.)  


Oh, and on the subject of $Son... he started writing himself and has been publishing fan fiction for Bofuri that is actually pretty good. I'll post a link to it when I can.  


$Godfather has been cut off entirely - will need to document that story (with a ton of trigger warnings), and it may not be entirely over yet. It depends on what choices certain individuals make. Time will tell. I don't suspect I will see him anywhere outside a courtroom again.  


Oh, and me? I celebrated two years without nicotine after quiting smoking, June 21st ,2023.    


## Conclusion  


So basically, I am back. I am doing well. I have just been insanely busy and developing this strange thing called a social life. I do plan to start writing on a regular basis again.",15,1757501828.0,patches765,2,1.0,False

1nday34,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1nday34/struggling_with_myself_due_to_husbands_feelings/,Struggling with myself due to husbands feelings,"Hello everyone. I'm kinda new here, but I just have the need to vent to people who maybe understand my feelings. as a disclaimer: we live in Germany, so you still get paid if you've called in sick and therapy or psychiatric clinics are also paid for. And I do think that my husband is probably severely depressed and probably he doesn't hate me, but this here is about my struggle with it.

I (30F) was diagnosed with Borderline 10 years ago. I'm with my husband (31M) for 11 years. He always supported me, and it wasn't always easy. I struggle with selfharm and impulsivity. I wasn't able to keep a job or do anything for longer than a year. But I always tried to keep him out of my chaotic feelings - I told him when I wasn't feeling good, so that he could keep his distance and through therapy I learned to regulate myself better and communicate things straight away. This way our relationship was always honest and transparent. He also told me everything important, so I felt safe and secure with him. Of course there were bad days and when my father died or other stressful things happened I was very down for a while. 

My husband has ADHD and suffers from depression every now and again. Earlier this year he came up with the idea to study for his bachelor while working. I was worried that it might be too much for him, as he also stopped taking his ADHD meds. I voiced my concerns, but he was determined. After he started college his work got really stressful and he was on edge the whole time. I told him that if he wanted to switch his workplace that would be fine for me and I would support him. But he kept on going and more crap piled on. His boss kicked him out of a project, without even telling him. He was so down after that and had no more motivation to even go to work. He was sick for 2 weeks, then he went back to work and in that week everything just shattered. 

Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday were just fine. We joked, laughed, kissed, flirted. He sometimes seemed a bit annoyed, when I asked him he said ""because of work"". On Thursday he was like another person. He didn't talk, he didn't look at me, he didn't want to be touched. I felt so rejected but I wanted to give him space so I waited. On Sunday he broke down crying, saying ""I don't know what's wrong with me, I thought about it the whole day and then I noticed that I didn't feel anything when I looked at you. So I guess my feelings for you are gone."". I broke down. I just didn't understand - days before everything was fine and now he didn't love me anymore? I cried and said that I can't see a future without him in it, that I don't know where to go or what to do. I asked him if I should move out and he said ""where would you go? No, stay here with me."". I asked if I should sleep on the couch, but he said no, he wants me to stay in bed with him. But if I'm uncomfortable he would sleep on the couch. The he cried some more, saying that he also doesn't understand what happened - on Wednesday everything was fine, but now everything is gone. The days after he cried a lot, said that he regretted saying anything, that he was scared that I would hate him and break up with him. He also said that he thought about dying. 

For the next 4 weeks we lived like this. Sleeping in one bed, talking like normal. He even wanted to do some things with me. Sometimes he brought me coffee in the morning, or bought my favorite drink. In the first week he also hugged me when I was sad. This confused me so much. And it hurt so bad. But week after week he grew more distant and he became so foreign to me. He avoided touching me like plague, but he said he was fine with me touching him. I felt so wrong. I stopped talking about my feelings or thoughts, I pushed everything down, because I didn't want to burden him any more. He went to a therapist who recommended a clinic and they diagnosed him with a ""double depression"". One week ago he went into the psychosomatic clinic. 

And I thought that when he's gone I would finally feel better. I felt so unsafe at home, I dreaded coming home and I had the need to run away every day. The first few days were okay. Then he texted me ""I miss you"". Which gave me hope yet again. On Sunday we talked on the phone and he was so quiet, distant and monotonous. He didn't tell me much about the clinic or how it was going. I hated it. I wanted the call to end as soon as possible. It was like talking to a stranger. And since then I am completely spiralling out of control. 

My heart beats so fast, I get dizzy and can't breathe. Then my gut quenches and I feel so hopeless. My thoughts are all over the place, but they all tell me that it's over, that he hates me, everything is hopeless and I should stop hoping. Then I see those pictures in front of my eyes - from my childhood, from the day he told me about his feelings. My heart feels like it will explode and my whole body breaks under the pressure. Then I get those very bad thoughts - how you can't trust anyone, maybe he already has someone else, love is just an illusion. I get the urge to gain control, control anything, something. I trust no one and I want to see no one. My body burns. I don't want to eat. If I try to distract myself it doesn't work, my thoughts automatically return to him and how he will betray and hurt me even more. I think yesterday I started splitting, because I started feeling burning hatred for him. I don't want so see him, I want him to leave me alone. But not really, because I also miss him. And then I just want to vanish. Afterwards I feel numb and then after a few hours it starts over. If he doesn't text me I see it as a sign that he hates me. Everything is a sign. But I do know that all thouse thoughts and feelings are irrational. They are legitimate, but not everything is true. So I never act on those feelings, I just bear it.

I really don't know what to do. I know I need help, urgently. But I can't go anywhere. I'm trapped. We have a dog, who is disabled and needs special care. He is also VERY attached to me and won't eat when I'm gone. He only tolerates it if my husband is there. So I need to wait another 5 weeks for my husband to finish his clinic, before I can go anywhere. And right now I'm struggling to imagine another 5 weeks of this. Do any of you have tips to survive those 5 weeks? I'm already looking for a psychologist and other things I can go to during the week, but it's a slow progress. My psychologist sadly passed away in January, so I'm kinda stranded. But I do have an appointment tomorrow where they can maybe get me some form of help. My husband might be coming home on Saturday, for one night. I am SO scared. I'm scared that he will be distant again or that he may finally reject me. I'm also scared that he might want to sleep on the couch, distancing himself more and more. I don't know what to do. :( 

TL;DR: My husband is severely depressed and told me that he thinks his feelings for me are gone. We didn't separate and lived together the last 4 weeks, which drained me. Now he is in a clinic getting help, but I feel like I am spiralling out of control and I don't have any help right now.

\- SINGLE (of course).

\- **AGE: 26+**

\- I just hope that if we’re on the same page, you’re **SERIOUS** when messaging me. Being serious doesn’t mean boring - it just means genuinely wanting to get to know each other. We can definitely become good friends, and if something more happens, we’ll see where the future takes us

\- And I really like it when someone is open with me, because I’m the same with you. I don’t mind reading long messages. In fact, I enjoy them, so please don’t hesitate. **PLEASE OPEN WITH ME! \^\^**

**- If you’re just looking to joke around, small talk, quick chat, flirty , or send the same message to multiple people without reading my post, I’d prefer if you did that elsewhere. I’m looking for genuine conversation here.**

**- About me:**  
\- I'm 23, Vietnam. I know it might seem unusual for a 23-year-old to want to talk to people much older, but I often interact with older folks - they’ve helped me think things through and I’ve learned a lot from them. Of course, not everyone is perfect, but I really value the experience.

\- **Appearance**: I’m the kind of woman that if you met me in real life, you probably wouldn’t even bother to come up and talk to me. Honestly, there’s nothing really striking or even attractive about me the way most men would hope for. So don’t expect too much from me. I mean that sincerely.

**- Personality**: **Swear a lot (I need people who don’t get bothered by that or we can do that together lol) , straightforward**, like **making joke**\- i can be serious too, if we click, I will talk non-stop. There is more but we need to figure out. 

**- Hobbies**: going to museum especially history museum, reading romance novel, coloring in color book, watch streamer about horror games, take picture from my phone - i dont have any a digital camera because I take pretty bad pictures, I love coffee and beer - I always want to try every kind of those.

Here's the validation strategy we've developed and now built into our platform:



**Step 1:** The $6 Reality Check Before spending on development, we invest $5.80 in validation. Less than a daily coffee, but with massive ROI. This approach treats validation as a critical business expense, not an afterthought.



**Step 2:** Multi-Framework Analysis Our AI Founder platform runs every idea through three proven frameworks:



ICE Scoring: Impact, Confidence, Ease assessment

Jobs-to-be-Done: What job is the customer hiring the product to do?

Lean Canvas: One-page business model validation

**Step 3:** Early Termination Protocol We've built our multi-agent system to flag problematic ideas immediately. The conditional DAG execution pattern stops the validation process if critical issues are detected, saving time and resources. This approach eliminates emotional attachment and provides objective analysis.



Results from 1,000+ validations through our system:

60% of ideas needed major pivots

25% were completely invalid

15% had strong validation signals

Only validated ideas proceeded to development



**Questions for the community:**

What's your validation budget vs. development budget ratio?

Which frameworks have worked best for your industry?

How do you overcome emotional attachment to unvalidated ideas?

Would love to hear your validation strategies and what's worked (or failed) for you.",1,1757501299.0,FoundersHub,1,1.0,False
1ndau8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ndau8x/need_help_dealing_with_marriage_breakdown/,Need help dealing with marriage breakdown,"Hi - I’m M27, just separated from my wife of 3 years. It was a hugely toxic relationship, I had been trying to end it for over a year but couldn’t go through for various reasons. 

Finally got the courage about 3 months ago and let her go. I left and have been trying to rebuild my life since then. Lost a lot of things due to this, like my house, had to sell the car and she took our cat. 


Now I’m extremely lonely, to the point where I almost went back to her. I know for sure that I do not want to go back to her. But I don’t have many friends here (I recently moved countries), I have an okay job, but I’m unable to work, unable to make new friends, there is just this feeling of hopelessness and sadness in my chest that isn’t letting me do anything. 

There is a girl I know who I sort of like as well, and she’s been supportive through my separation, and idk if she likes me or is just being friendly. Its probably the latter but I feel weird about her, should I talk to her or not? Should I ask her for a lunch/coffee together or not? These questions just keep doing rounds in my head. And I know it’s not because I want to have a relationship with her, it’s just that I am alone. 

This is my first major break up. I’m unable to deal with it and I’m done being strong about it. I  need help and I need someone to talk to. Can anyone just talk to me and idk tell me how to process this?",1,1757501266.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False
1ndaty2,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1ndaty2/my_story_of_dating_a_borderline_woman/,My story of dating a borderline woman,"It’s very hard to write a short description of what happened but I am gonna try to summarize it.

I’m a 28-year-old man. Last January I went on holiday I where I met a 27-year-old woman. From the very first date we had an intense connection, the energy was sky high. Looking back, I realize there was also trauma bonding, though I didn’t recognize it at the time. When I had to return home, we decided to date exclusively. We were in contact every single day. She texted me a lot, really a lot, and at night we would FaceTime for hours. She would say that I was “the one” and spoke about marriage and kids. 

When I flew back to see her again, it was still just as intense and fun. But soon things started to change. We began to argue more and more. I know I played a part in that too. I was blindly in love and became more anxious with things, since I deal with PTSD. She was easily triggered and carried a lot of anger. She told me she had been diagnosed with depression, ADD and has diabetes, though she also said she had been misdiagnosed before. She followed some BPD accounts on Instagram, which left me confused, but I didn’t think too much of it at the time. Also wasn’t really aware of what BPD actually was at its core.

As the arguments escalated, I flew over again trying to fix things. But deep down my nervous system was already warning me that something was off. She started saying things like “you should respond like this” and “you should act like this when…” Sometimes she behaved in a childlike way, and I began to feel like I was seeing different faces of her. During one big argument things exploded. She completely lost control in a way I had never seen before. Her eyes were full of rage and tears, almost pitch black. I am not gonna say that I handled it well, because I sure made mistakes during that argument. I was very triggered by her dominance and entitlement during this argument and it had set me off as well. In the end I was trying to soothe the situation whilst she was packing her bags and throwing the rings I gave her across the room, though at the same time she wanted me to fight for her. The next day she moved on pretty easy from the situation, but my nervous system was on high alert. I couldn’t comprehend what happened. 

Two weeks later she came to my country for almost a month, and that’s when everything really spiraled. She was constantly triggered by the smallest comments, and every escalation ended with me being the one at fault. When I introduced her to my parents, she said I didn’t do it properly. Meeting my brother and sister-in-law, I made one comment that upset her and it turned into another fight. Time after time she would threaten to leave, even make it seem like she was booking flight-tickets back, then call her mom or friends to speak badly about me. But at the same time, whenever I accepted her leaving, she expected me to fight for her. During a family weekend she gave me the silent treatment, accused me of abandoning her, and lashed out at me even though I and my family tried hard to make her feel welcome. She even managed to turn me against my sister-in-law. There was so much disrespect and backhanded comments disguised as “jokes”. 

Whenever I expressed my own feelings, they were quickly dismissed. She would tell me to just shrug it off, or say that her friends accepted her as she was. She often accused me of yelling, when in reality I was only raising my voice sometimes because I was desperate to get through to her. Still, it was always turned back on me and I was made to feel like the bad guy. Over time I began to feel ashamed, guilty, and started believing her version of events. I was given the silent treatment multiple times. She compared me to boyfriends of her friends, projected her hatred of her father onto me, and made me feel like I could never do anything right. And the double standards were unreal.

I was on a constant rollercoaster, walking on eggshells. My nervous system was a mess. I tried everything to please her, taking her on city trips, going to a concert she liked, dinners, experiences, anything, even though I’m a freelancer and had to sacrifice work to do all this, while she had no job and could sleep until late in the morning. Yet somehow she still said she felt like a “yes man” towards me. I even made her breakfast and coffee in the mornings.

I know I wasn’t perfect either, I know that. I grew irritated much faster than usual because I felt trapped in a dynamic where nothing I did was good enough in her eyes. Before this, I felt more grounded, in my work, sports and goals (despite my PTSD). But I became a shell of who I used to be. I knew deep down I was being manipulated, but I had no hard evidence. She even accused me of gaslighting and manipulation, which made me feel like I was going insane. At one point she told me that she had placed me on a pedestal, but after sometime she said that I wasn’t the guy who I was when we met so she had thrown me off the pedestal. 

And here’s another very odd thing: She told me she had stage 1 ovarian cancer, but later I found out it wasn’t true. It was pre-cancer. Still serious, but why not tell the truth? When I confronted her about it she acted like she didn’t knew and said “as long as it’s gone”. She had told many people she had stage 1 ovarian cancer and always spoke about things she wanted to do before she would pass away.. 

In the meantime she was drinking alcohol, smoking sometimes and doing nothing to obtain better habits. 

I also noticed there was always someone from the past. Over the course of time we were together about 4 exes of her reached out asking about her cancer. I don’t want to assume things but it was almost as if she used it to gain empathy.

Then came the stories of her exes and most of them had “hurt” her. One of mentally abused her, she threatened him with a butterknife and scratched his face with her nails and other crazy shit. But still she wanted to marry this guy she and would even become religious for him. 

She also had been to the psych ward in the past, twice. And I was apparently the only one she told since I was her “best friend..” yeah right..

She also had the weirdest relationship with her mom. She loved and hated her. She would talk badly of her when they would fight, but would run back to her mom in an instant when we would argue and then her mom would be her “judge”.

Later she made a list of things I should change and the things I did wrong. Whilst the only things I wanted from her was some peace and mutual respect. 

Eventually I had to break up with her. My family encouraged me to end it because they couldn’t bear to see what was happening to me, and they had to set their own boundaries with her too. After I broke up she went nuts and said I wasn’t worth it, I am selfish and it’s my loss.

She drained everything out of me, and I allowed it because I kept making excuses for her behavior. Without getting into too much detail, the damage she caused is unreal. I later learned, after telling a psychologist and a psychiatrist everything, that she also has borderline personality disorder or very strong traits. This isn’t to bash BPD, but I wish I had known. The relationship completely wrecked me.

Now I’m the one on medication, even though I always wanted to live a healthy lifestyle. Even my therapist(s) don’t know what to do. I can’t see the light no more.

It has now been three months since the breakup. Yet I still miss her, I still blame myself for so many things, and I feel stuck in a vicious loop, knowing the relationship was toxic, but struggling to let go.

I also feel like now she will be a better version of herself for someone else. Or is that an illusion? 

There is much more to the story which is quite heavy and has been really damaging. But it’s already a long read.",10,1757501238.0,BPDlovedones,7,0.92,False

    * Facilitate structured discovery sessions with stakeholders to uncover goals, metrics, blockers, and context
    * Translate customer needs into compelling, actionable solution designs that reflect product fit and implementation strategy
    * Partner with AEs to shape opportunity flow—including qualification, stakeholder coverage, and demo alignment
    * Work cross-functionally with Architects, Product, and Services to validate solution approaches and flag risks early

1ndaqhw,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenHFY/comments/1ndaqhw/binary_awakening_chapter_15_interview/,[Binary Awakening] Chapter 15: Interview,"**Chapter 15: Interview**  
  
Christine leaned slightly forward, her notebook resting on the table untouched, her eyes fixed on the woman across from her. Elena’s expression was bright, almost luminous, as if the memory she was about to share radiated from within.  
  
""I can’t really explain how,"" Elena began, her voice soft, brimming with sincerity, ""but when we got married, something inside me something deep was unlocked. The love I felt for Luca didn’t just grow… it multiplied. I’ve never been so happy in my life.""  
  
Christine studied her carefully. There was no trace of deceit, no performance. Elena believed every word she said. That made her dangerous… or perhaps valuable.  
  
""So,"" Christine said, her tone gentle but probing, ""you’d say it was the marriage itself that changed everything?""  
  
Elena hesitated, her brow furrowing as she searched through her thoughts.  
  
""Well… not exactly. But yes, it was during those days. Something shifted.""  
  
""Not exactly?"" Christine pressed, the tip of her pen still untouched by ink. ""Did something else happen around that time?""  
  
Elena nodded slowly, her gaze drifting toward the window as if the memory was playing just beyond the glass.  
  
""A few days before the wedding, I almost died."" Her voice dropped to a whisper. ""Can you imagine? I was about to begin the happiest chapter of my life, and then… the universe nearly took it away.""  
  
Christine’s fingers tensed slightly on the edge of the table.  
  
""What happened?""  
  
""I was crossing the street, not really paying attention. There was this truck it came out of nowhere, speeding like the driver had lost control. I jumped aside just in time. If I had taken one more step…"" Elena’s voice trembled, but her eyes were distant now, reliving the moment. ""And then Luca appeared. He ran to me, held me. His face… it was pure panic and love. I saw something in him that day. A kind of devotion that… unlocked something in me. A new layer of love. Do you know what it feels like to wake up next to the love of your life every morning? Sometimes I just lie there in silence and watch him sleep. He’s my angel. My hero. My... ""  
  
""What kind of truck?"" Christine interrupted. Her voice was calm, but her patience was fraying.  
  
""What?"" Elena blinked, momentarily disoriented.  
  
""What kind of accident? And was anyone else there besides Luca?""  
  
Elena blinked again, but the interruption didn’t seem to shake her glow. Her smile returned, warm and dreamy.  
  
""Yes… actually. There was a friend of Luca’s. What was his name…?"" She tapped her finger against her chin. ""Egon?... Ethan?... No... Evan. Yes, Evan. He was an old friend of Luca’s. A curious type.""  
  
Christine leaned in imperceptibly. Her heartbeat quickened.  
  
""Curious how?""  
  
Elena chuckled softly. ""He said he had this… lifelong project. To know everyone in the world. Can you imagine? Everyone. I mean, that’s just… strange, right? But sweet in a way. I remember thinking: I only need Luca to feel complete. Why would someone need the whole world?""  
  
Christine didn’t respond. Her mind was already racing.  
  
""That day,"" Elena continued, ""the day I nearly died that was the last time we saw Evan. He came by the apartment. We had coffee together. It was… a lovely visit. Warm. There was something deeply comforting about him. He and Luca shared a bond that felt… real. I even felt a little jealous for a moment.""  
  
Christine raised an eyebrow. ""Jealous?""  
  
Elena smiled again, this time with a hint of self-awareness. ""I realized I had nothing to worry about. Whatever they shared, it was old and deep, but it didn’t threaten what Luca and I had. If anything, it made me happy to see Luca so at ease, so himself. It was beautiful.""  
  
Christine’s gaze narrowed subtly.  
  
""And nothing unusual happened during that conversation?""  
  
""No, not at all. It was… peaceful. Fulfilling. Evan was very attentive, very present. He listened more than he spoke. You could tell he genuinely cared about Luca. About both of us, really.""  
  
Christine sat back slightly, folding her hands. ""You’re very lucky, Elena. What you have with Luca… it’s rare. I admit, I’m a little envious.""  
  
Elena laughed gently. ""You’ll find it too. I’m sure of it. Love like this… it changes you.""  
  
Christine smiled, but it didn’t reach her eyes. ""I think I have everything I need for my book. Thank you so much for your time.""  
  
""It’s been a pleasure,"" Elena said, standing to shake her hand. ""Please let me know when the book comes out. I’d love to read it.""  
  
""Oh, of course,"" said Christine as she stood up and extended her hand, offering a firm handshake as she delivered her response—carefully worded to ensure Elena wouldn’t bother her again. ""Since this topic is quite important, I’m going to take my time. Maybe I’ll release it in a million years—I want to do a perfect job. Sorry, but if you’ll excuse me, I have another appointment. It’s been a pleasure, Elena. Take care.""  
  
Christine turned and exited the café, her coat catching in the breeze as she stepped outside. She didn’t look back.  
  
Pretending to be writing a book about marriage had been the perfect excuse to arrange the meeting. The interview had confirmed what she needed. The spark she felt in Elena it wasn’t from Luca. She’d already met Luca, and while he held a faint trace of awakening, it was dim, residual. Elena, however, glowed.  
  
Now, she had a new target.  
  
She was going to find this Evan guy.

1ndao9a,https://i.redd.it/or1ua84wfbof1.jpeg,I built an AI essay grader to save my teacher friend from drowning in papers – would love feedback from English teachers,"One of my closest friends is a high school English teacher. Every grading season, I’d hear the same stories: late nights, coffee overload, endless stacks of essays, and the impossible task of giving every student detailed, meaningful feedback.

So… I built something for her.

It’s called GraderAI – an AI essay grader where you can:

Upload a batch of student essays

Choose or upload your own rubric

Enter the essay instructions/prompt

Get back detailed, teacher-like feedback with strengths, areas for improvement, and an overall score (plus breakdowns for each criterion)


The goal isn’t to replace teachers – it’s to save hours of repetitive grading while still giving students actionable, personalized feedback.

I’d love to get real feedback from actual English teachers:

Would you ever use something like this?

What features would make it genuinely helpful (or what’s missing)?

Any red flags I should know about?


Here’s the link if you want to try it: ai-essay-grader.com

If you’re constantly buried under essays, I hope this could give you a few hours of your life back.

Thanks in advance – and if you roast it, roast it hard. I want to make this better.",0,1757500695.0,ELATeachers,12,0.13,False

1ndanza,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ndanza/am_i_overreacting_by_being_creeped_out_by_this_guy/,Am I overreacting by being creeped out by this guy?,"I am in my second year of college, I've never had a boyfriend or first kiss and have had some very poor dates and situationships getting me fuck all. I don't have much knowledge in the realm of dating and am pretty sheltered in experience.

Last week I met ""Tom"" another second year student in one of my classes, we got along well and has some pretty good banter. The following day Tom had asked to ""hangout"" and through my interpretation I had perceived it as a friendship kind of hangout. I saw him later during that day, and he was quite touchy with me, and I was a little shocked as I don't have many male friends and didn't know if this was normal. An old friend saw the two of us and approached me, telling me about the time they had gone out together during their first year of college. Everything was fine but they clashed pretty badly, having opposing political views, life goals, and expectations of dating. That friend had told me that Tom was quite clingy, I really should have listened to her warning.

Going back to my student accomodation that day, he asked me out. I politely declined as I was ill, and brushed him off. I did like his personality at the time, however him having gone out with a good friend of mine was a complete turn off. Over roughly the next five days, he had asked me out four times, each with a different date idea that I either brushed off or declined because I didn't like the situation.

We share a common lecture, and have a very similar campus schedule. I had deflected the date asks and suggested that we get a bite or coffee during our break. When I got to campus, I had this churning feeling in my stomach, and he had asked for where I was and came to my friend and I. My friend knew that I was uneasy, and that I felt like he was being too pushy, so she stayed by me. He made a really immature joke about Thailand and it had rubbed me the wrong way, I was convinced that I didn't want to see him. I avoided him the whole day, having a few friends on lookout as I had other things to do but I did have time to grab a coffee.

A close friend that I had shared my unease to asked if he knew my name. I though this was a stupid question because how can you ask me out four times, over Instagram and still not know my name?! She urged me to ask him, and just see where it went.

When it came time for our shared lecture, I sat with my table group as per usual, and he came and sat directly next to me publicly announcing it. I wanted to die, everyone was looking at us and I made him move to the able across me. My table mates were uncomfortable as fuck as he kept kind of bouncing in his seat, very obviously staring at me and making it his mission to respond to everything I says, even if it wasn't directed towards him. In this moment I asked him if he knew my name, he said no! Claiming it was hard to pronounce and remember - my name is not hard to pronounce or remember, it's fairly common. My whole table went what the fuck, including myself. On our way out, he pushed past one of my girlfriends and walked beside me, I told him he was moving way too fast and needed to slow down. He looked offended and just walked off to find another friend of his. All my friends are beyond invested in this shit-show and all agree that I should block him.

Today, I had another lecture on campus and I saw him. I had avoided all of his messages, not responding on Instagram, as I wanted to firmly communicate my boundaries and wishes to him today. I waved at him and he ignored me, then during my lecture spammed my phone with messages asking why I was ignoring him.

The people who sit around me were so invested they offered to write me a paragraph that was along the lines of 'I want to be friends, and we are not on the same wavelength right now'. I sent the message and he responded with some pick me bullshit saying that he's 'really cringey and that he was only trying to be nice but I'm overreacting, etc'.

At this point, I am so done with this situation. I feel really bad because I have rejected him but how can you ask me out four times without knowing my name?! I feel so stresses because I don't know if I have done the right thing and I just feel like shit for rejecting him. I was uncomfortable with the touching, the fuck ass jokes, weird Instagram reels and his constant lack of social awareness and cues (no he's not an exceptional learner).

Yesterday something really special happened for me. I bought a laptop from a girl, and she was honestly so beautiful like an angel. Her eyes were like black holes… once you fall in, you can’t escape.

After buying the laptop, I asked her to have a cup of coffee . To my surprise, she said yes! We had such a nice time together, just chatting and laughing, and for me this was actually the first time I’ve ever gone out for coffee with a girl.

She traveled but she’s still on my mind. I don’t know what the future holds, but for me, it felt like a really meaningful moment. 

I don't know what to do now, I feel I can't text her since I only used the chat to give my feedback on the laptop.

1ndalk3,https://www.reddit.com/r/LongDistance/comments/1ndalk3/i_22f_love_him_25m_but_im_exhausted/,I (22F) love him (25M) but I’m exhausted,"Hi Reddit,

I (22F) been with my boyfriend (25M) for almost 3 years, and about 2 of those have been long distance. We’ve had ups and downs, but lately I feel like we’re speaking different languages when it comes to love and appreciation.

My love language is quality time, his is acts of service. He often buys me gifts or does things for me, and while I appreciate the effort, it doesn’t always feel fulfilling. I’ve told him that being with him means more to me than any gift. For example, for my birthday he bought me a lounge set and camera accessories (things I had mentioned wanting), but part of me just wished he used that money toward a plane ticket so we could spend time together.

Anytime I bring up things that would make me feel loved—like wanting him to be there for milestones, or even just celebrating me more publicly the way he does with his work—he says I’m “comparing him” to other people. I don’t mean it that way. I just want to feel supported in ways that matter to me. For instance, I recently made a team I auditioned for, and while my friends congratulated me and even reposted the news, he just sent me a text. It stung because he posts often about other things, but hardly about me. When I try to explain, he insists I’m comparing him to others.

We also have a history that makes things harder. Early in our relationship, he cheated. Later, when he went through my phone (and found nothing other than me telling an ex [fully aware of our relationship btw] from soph. HS what dining halls were still open and telling him happy birthday ), he froze me out and it reminded me of my mom’s controlling behavior growing up. Since then, intimacy has been really hard for me. He doesn’t fully understand why, and sometimes I feel like he sees me as “playing victim.” He’s always been one to get upset when I would try to do school work outside of school grounds with project partners. I was a media major, I preferred sports and was a technical hand for an all male podcast crew aside from me…I had very little female friends in my major since there wasn’t many. 

“You’re not treating it like school.” I was…just not in a way that was like him. I’m a home body and spent majority of my time at school working/with clubs/using the schools equipment that I would rather work on a project on the floor in my living room than the crowded coffee shop off campus. It got to a point where any accomplishments I had that involved a male I was nervous to express. It wasn’t uncommon for him to scope their instagrams or (one time) he had liked my comment under a post from 2021 on a guys page after making a joke about their school they’re at losing the biggest rivalry game. When I tried to call him on it he then said that I had followed an ex of his as well so he was doing the same…that ex he is referring to of his has followed me first because we met at a Greek event, NOTHING to do with him. 

It’s not just men, I have a close friend who is gay, and he proceeded to warn me about her over dinner and have a conversation with my gay sister to be aware of her. He had just met this girl, only knew how we talked to eachother (like typical best friends) and he immediately felt some type of way about her. She bought me flowers for grad and nice birthdays gifts as repayment for letting her stay with me while she found a safe spot for herself while the ex still had access to her place. He wasn’t happy about that. I’m assuming this “hatred” comes from the fact that I believe his ex began dating a woman after him. 

I love him, but I’m exhausted. I feel like I pour so much of myself into remembering the little details about him, showing up emotionally, and sacrificing for this relationship, while he doesn’t seem to do the same in return. Moving jobs is a risk in its self. He says moving to Dallas (closer to me and his family) is “in the forefront of his mind,” but I don’t see him actively working toward it. He hasn’t put any thought into it and is worried about gaining the needed experience. 

The only way I would move to BOS is if it benefited me, as in doesn’t leave me in debt, jobless and stuck. I have been looking into full time positions out there and a masters program at BU, it’s so expensive in the state alone and I see myself running back to the south as soon as I get my degree. I’m also big on not living with him initially either ( the dependent gf is a disaster waiting to happen, we see it TOO MUCH these days), so finding a place to stay is another thing. I’m not in an industry where they provide housing/stipends to relocate like his. 

So here’s my dilemma:

Am I being unfair for wanting more when he already “does things” for me?

Or is it reasonable to feel like long distance requires extra effort to make up for the lack of physical presence?

And how do I explain my needs without it sounding like I’m constantly comparing him to others?

I don’t want to give up on him, but I don’t know how much longer I can keep pushing when I already feel like I’m running on empty. He says it takes two people giving effort but I don’t know what more else I can do.

I watched every coffee potato video in existence! I leveled up clerics etc and swapped them over to these two classes and loaded them up with my best mind gear and I can't get over 20% debuff chance with the TKs and 10% with the sword masters. The chances are so poor that I've yet to stick a debuff with the SMs after multiple fights even though they have a big aoe.

I love my swordmasters and the potential to throw them to the front to focus on countering while spreading breach/weaken but I just can't seem to get them there -- viable or just not possible?? I really don't want to mine charm cheese.


Side note: A big help to the survivability are cross bow guardian force/phalanx knights in my midfield positiones to mitigate damage for both the front and back lines. Absolutely my favorite build for knights. ",3,1757499937.0,Tactics_Ogre,2,1.0,False
