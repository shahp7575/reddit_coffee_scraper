Je partage ici un petit projet perso que j’ai développé ces derniers mois : [CoHu Founders Edition](https://nicob-44.github.io/cohu-fe-web/#/fr-fr) (nom raccourci : CoHu FE).

C’est un site qui suit en quasi-temps réel la **disponibilité des cartes graphiques NVIDIA Founders Edition** (RTX 5090, 5080, etc.) sur les sites officiels NVIDIA en Europe et aux US.

En gros, le site :

* Communautaire : Gratuit, pas d'email, de cookies, tracker, compte à créer ni rien...
* Permet de recevoir une **alerte push instantanée** quand un drop est détecté pour les modèles choisis.
* Permet de consulter un **historique des drops par pays** pour comprendre la fréquence et les tendances.

Le service est **gratuit, anonyme et sans affiliation**. (J'ai quand même un lien ""Buy me a coffee"" si jamais vous vouler m'aider a couvrir les coûts, principalement serveurs)

C’est avant tout un outil que j'ai fait pour me replonger un peu dans le code et rendre service à la communauté.

Le site devrait être compatibles avec les futures cartes, mais toujours limitées au Founders Edition uniquement.

Je serais très preneur de vos retours sur :

* La clarté du site
* L’intérêt de l’historique des drops
* Les éventuelles bugs
* Et vos souhaits de fonctionnalités que vous aimeriez voir.

This post will focus on a selection of questions about the Korean language and honorifics system, check out our FAQ for even more information.

If you have any additional questions about the information in this post or our FAQ, feel free to leave a comment with your question/feedback.

**What Is Hangeul/Hangul?**

The Korean phonemic writing system, in other words, the written Korean alphabet. [*See More Details*](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_hangeul_and_the_korean_language)

**Why Do Koreans Use So Many English Words?**

Korean language has many naturalized words borrowed from different languages, many of the naturalized words from 21st century come from English (eg. coffee, orange juice).

**How To Romanize Korean Names**

According to [Korea's official romanization system](https://www.korean.go.kr/front_eng/roman/roman_01.do):

* (4) Personal names are written by family name first, followed by a space and the given name. As a rule, syllables in given names are not seperated by hyphen, but it is admitted to use a hyphen between syllables. (Transcription in (  ) is permitted.)

> Example

>> 민용하	Min Yongha (Min Yong-ha)

As for different ways of romanizing last names:

* Transcriptions of family names will be established additionally.

Basically, unifying romanization of last names will be a greater challenge since it involves a lot things (changing passports, verifying identities, cultural value of last names, etc.).

Learn more about [romanization](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_romanization_of_korean) and [how to address others](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_addressing_others). 

**What Is Honorifics/Polite Speech?**

Hierarchy is very important in Korean culture and the Korean language reflects that through its complex honorifics system, the proper use of which is crucial for all social interactions. The Korean honorifics system is comprised of both specialized vocabulary and grammar rules, the most famous being its speech levels (addressee honorifics; distinctive sentence enders). The use of the honorifics system conveys important information about the context of the speech and the speaker’s relationship with the subject (referent) and the listener (addressee) of the speech. The relationship indicated can be based on a variety of factors such as age, gender, social status, and degree of intimacy.

The most well-known aspect of the Korean honorifics system is its speech levels, also known as addressee honorifics (hearer honorifics), represented by distinctive sentence enders. The sentence enders are determined based on sentence type and the speaker’s relationship to the listener (addressee) of the speech. The selection of which speech level to use is heavily context and purpose dependent, thus different speech levels are used to indicate varying degrees of social hierarchy, familiarity, and formality along with the purpose or intent of the speech. This means that sometimes a speaker will even use a mix of different speech levels when interacting with the same person within a given situation. Furthermore, depending on the exact context of use and communicative intent of the speaker, the meaning conveyed by the speech may be opposite or different than what that speech level traditionally represents (for example, if the speaker was being sarcastic). Thus no one style is polite or impolite in all situations, the context must be considered when figuring out the intended meaning. In general though, when the speaker wants to show respect toward the listener (addressee) of their speech, they will choose a honorific speech level. 

When discussing Korean speech levels, note that the Korean language itself is split along the lines of honorific [존댓말 (jondaemal)] and non-honorific [반말 (banmal)] rather than informal and formal. And the key to determining whether honorific level should or should not be used depends on the relationship between the speaker and the listener and the situation. While it is true that in very formal situations, honorific forms will be used, it is not the case that non-honorific forms will always be used in non-formal situations. Honorific forms can still be used in informal situations.

An example to explain this is that you are trying to ask for directions from a stranger, for example the cashier at the convenience store. The situation is not a formal situation but you would still be using the honorific form (jondaemal) because you are addressing a stranger.

In any situation, formal or non-formal, if the listener is of superior status (due to age, generation, work relationship, etc.) and the speaker wants to acknowledge or demonstrate that difference, they would use honorifics when addressing the listener and at the same time ""lower"" themselves when talking about themselves. By ""lower"", it means that the speaker wants their language to reflect their respect for the listener. It's not used in the sense that the speaker consider themselves as inferior to the listener, just that they are trying to demonstrate their respect for the listener. If on the other hand, the speaker does not want to or need to lower themselves in comparison to the listener, their speech can reflect that too.   

>> 존댓말 (jondaemal) is honorific speech (also called polite speech), which includes both the deferential and the polite speech levels, and indicates that the speaker views the listener with respect and is honoring the listener. 존대 (jondae) literally means respect.

>> 반말 (banmal) is non-honorific speech (also called impolite speech), which includes both the plain and the intimate speech level. 반말 (banmal) can be literally translated as *half-speech*.

Below is a ***rough*** guide to honorific markers in Korean and their significance. For more details, see our [full section](/r/KDRAMA/wiki/generalresources#wiki_honorifics_and_speech_levels) on honorifics in our KDRAMA 101. 

**2 Important Things To Remember**

A speaker may use a mix of different speech levels when interacting with the same person within a given situation.

No speech level is polite or impolite in all situations; the context and intent of the speaker is the ultimate determinator of intended meaning. (In other words: *sarcasm* exists.) 

**When You Hear ~ᄇ니다  ~ᄇ니까?  ~ᄇ시오  ~ᄇ시다** { ~pnida  ~pnikka?  ~psio  ~psida }

> ***Speech Level***: Deferential

> ***Used When***: Public or formal discourse such as in broadcasting or conference presentations. | Addressing the public. | When a subordinate addresses a superior in a formal situation.


**When You Hear ~요 (~yo)**

> ***Speech Level***: Polite

> ***Used When***: Addressing someone of senior status in casual, non-formal, and everyday types of conversations. | Addressing someone who is an equal, based on factors such as age/status/power/etc. (coworkers, acquaintances, classmates, etc.) | Between strangers. | Addressing someone older. | In a new relationship (friendship/dating).


**When You Hear ~다  ~니/냐?  ~라  ~자** { ~da  ~ni?/nya?  ~ra  ~ja }

> ***Speech Level***: Plain

> ***Used When***: In written form for nonspecific listeners (books, magazines, etc.) | When a superior addresses a subordinate. | Addressing someone younger in casual situations but the relationship may not be a super close one. | Addressing close friends or otherwise agreed to by both parties (includes dating relationships).


**When You Hear ~어/아 ( ~eo/a)**

> ***Speech Level***: Intimate

> ***Used When***: Between close friends of similar age. | Between family members. | When an elder addresses a child.


**When You Hear ~님 (~nim) and 씨 (~ssi)**

> * ~nim and ~ssi are honorific title suffixes, used to show respect by the speaker for the person who’s name/job title is modified with the suffix.

> * ~nim shows the most respect and can be added directly to names or job titles with or without the surname (used to distinguish when multiple people hold the same position).

> * ~ssi can only be added to names, not job titles. Can be attached to full name (more formal/less intimate), only the given name (less formal/more intimate), or just the surname (implies the addressee is of lower social position).

**When You Hear 나 (na) and 우리 (uri) for I/Me and Us**

> * Used when speaker and listener are relatively equal to each other or are close to each other.

> * Generally not used in formal situations.

**When You Hear 저 (jeo) and 저희 (jeohui) for I/Me and Us**

> * Used when the listener is of superior status or when speaking with strangers.

> * Used often in formal situations.


**Addressing Someone By Name**

Koreans generally do not call people by their given names unless the speaker is a (close) friend, colleague, or superior of the listener. When names are used, they are often modified with honorific suffixes. Below are examples of use. 

> **Full Name + ~님/~씨** Used when addressing someone distant (no close personal relationship) or when a service employee is calling a customer. Used in conjunction with honorific speech levels (존댓말 (jondaemal)). (김진호 님 or 김진호 씨)

> **Given Name + ~씨** Used to address coworkers, acquaintances, friends or when a superior addresses a subordinate (such as in a work or college environment). Can imply that the interpersonal relationship is not a very close one. But can also just be a conscious decision by the relevant parties to remain respectful of each other. Used in conjunction with honorific speech levels (존댓말 (jondaemal)). (진호 씨)

> **Given Name** Used between (close) friends, classmates, or when someone older is addressing a younger person that they know or are familiar with. Parents would also call their children by just their given name. Used in conjunction with non-honorific speech levels (반말 (banmal)). (진호) *Note:* sometimes the vocative marker -a/-ya is added at the end of the name. This generally indicates a very close relationship. 

> **Full Name** When parents are addressing their child, it could either signify the child is in trouble (angry/exasperated tone) or the parent wants to talk to the child as an equal (friend) instead of asserting their parental authority (usually seen in dramas when the parent pulls the child over to sit and discuss something important). When used between friends or in a relationship, the person speaking is probably angry or the person being called is being absentminded/distracted and not paying attention. (김진호 (!))

**Addressing Someone By Title**

Koreans generally address each other by their (work) title. The honorific suffix ~nim can be added to the end of the title to show respect. This is especially the case when subordinates would address their superiors, they would use their superior’s title + ~nim suffix. It is possible to add the full name or just the surname before the title to clarify exactly who is being referred to if multiple people hold the same title. Coworkers may address each other as name + title without the ~nim suffix. When a superior addresses a subordinate, they generally do not add the ~nim suffix to the subordinate’s title or name. Some commonly used examples of titles:

|**Title**|**With Suffix**|**Meaning**|**Notes**|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-|
|사장|사장님|President, CEO, Owner|In a large company, refers to president of the company. For a shop/restaurant, refers to the owner. Can be used without attaching name in front.|
|과장|과장님|Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|감독|감독님|Director, Superintendent|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|팀장|팀장님|Team Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|부장|부장님|Director, Department Head|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|대리|대리님|Deputy, Assistant Manager|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|회장|회장님|Chairman|Can be used without attaching name in front. When used to address the person directly, generally only surname is added. When used to refer to the person, full name may be added.|
|이사|이사님|Director|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|선생|선생님|Teacher, Doctor|Can be used with just surname or full name.|
|교수|교수님|Professor|Can be used with just surname or full name.|

**Addressing Others By Their Social Position/Relationship**

Koreans may also address each other based on their social position or relationship. Below are the most commonly used ones.

* **Seonbae-Hubae (선배/후배)**

> 선배 (seonbae) is a Sino-Korean word that is often translated as a senior or elder in an organization, or an upperclassman when talking about school. But its use is not limited to a work or school setting, it can be applied more broadly as in “a seonbae in life”. Its Hanja is 先輩 and can be literally translated as prior (선/先) generation (배/輩). The priority does not depend on the age of the people in question but rather the achievement. So one can be a 선배 in school, work, or life achievements (such as marriage or having children).

> 후배 (hubae) is the corresponding Sino-Korean word that is often translated as a junior in an organization or an underclassman when talking about school. Its Hanja is 後輩 and can be literally translated as later (후/後) generation (배/輩). Again, the deciding factor is not the age of the people in question but the timing of the achievement.

> When the honorific suffix ~nim is added to 선배, it usually means that the two people are not very close personally or the situation is more formal (business meeting as opposed to coffee). When the hubae has a close relationship with the seonbae, they may use seonbae without the ~nim suffix.

* **Haksaeng (학생)**

> When an adult is talking to a student-aged young person that they do not know, they may address them with 학생 (haksaeng), which literally means student. This does not need to take place near a school, it could be anywhere. For example, it could be an adult asking a student on the street for directions.

* **{Child's Name} + Father/Mother**

> When adults are addressing other adults who are parents, it is possible to call the adult as their child’s name + father/mother instead of the adult's given name. So the father of the child will be called {child’s name} 아버님 (a-beo-nim, father), while the mother will be called {child’s name} 어머님 (eo-meo-nim, mother). If the conversation is one-one, such as when a teacher is talking only to one student’s parents without other people in the conversation, they may not add the child’s name in front and directly use 아버님 and 어머님.

**Kinship Terms**

Traditionally, Korean families were large and several generations would live together in a single household. As a result, kinship terms in Korean are well-developed and very specific according to the relationship in play. However, changes in social structure has affected the use of these terms and some are no longer used as often or how they are used has changed. Additionally, some kinship terms have been adapted for general use in daily life to refer to people other than relatives.

In addition to the abundance of kinship terms available, their proper use is complicated by the fact that choosing the appropriate term depends on who the listener is. 

Examples:

> * A grandson talking directly to his maternal grandmother can just address her as “grandmother” but if he was talking to his classmate, he would use “maternal grandmother” to describe her.

> * An uncle talking to his nephew about the nephew’s father would use “your father” instead of “my younger brother.” 
 
In order to differentiate the uses, this section on kinship terms will be split into two parts, the first part will address kinship terms when used to address relatives and the second part will highlight kinship terms in their other common uses.

'''Richard Thomas Malone''' (14 March 1956 – 22 August 1977), known professionally as '''Ricky ""The Rat"" Malone''', was an English singer-songwriter and musician who is widely regarded as a pioneering figure in the [[gutter pop]] genre. Emerging from the gritty underbelly of 1970s British urban life, Malone's music blended catchy pop melodies with raw, unfiltered lyrics drawn from street experiences, poverty, addiction, and disillusionment. His brief but explosive career, marked by a single studio album and a handful of incendiary singles, captured the zeitgeist of a disillusioned youth amid economic decline and social unrest in the UK.

Malone's rise to underground fame was meteoric, beginning with busking on the streets of Liverpool and culminating in chaotic, sold-out performances in London's punk clubs. However, his life was plagued by severe alcoholism, which ultimately led to his death at the age of 21 from acute alcohol poisoning. Despite his short lifespan, Malone's influence on subsequent genres like punk-pop, indie rock, and even elements of grunge has been profound, earning him a cult following and posthumous recognition as a tragic icon of the 1970s music scene. Critics have often compared him to contemporaries like [[Sid Vicious]] or [[Jim Morrison]], though Malone's style was distinctly more melodic and accessible, earning gutter pop the moniker ""the pop music of the sewers.""

## Early life

Richard Thomas Malone was born on 14 March 1956, in the working-class district of Toxteth, Liverpool, England. His father, Thomas Malone, was a dockworker who struggled with unemployment during the post-war economic shifts, while his mother, Eileen (née O'Reilly), worked as a cleaner in local factories. The family lived in cramped council housing, and Malone was the second of four children. From an early age, he was exposed to the harsh realities of urban poverty, including frequent evictions, domestic violence, and the pervasive influence of alcohol in his household—his father was a heavy drinker, which later mirrored Malone's own struggles.

Malone's education was sporadic; he attended St. Silas Church of England Primary School but was expelled at age 11 for truancy and disruptive behavior. He later enrolled in a secondary modern school but dropped out at 15, citing boredom and a desire to escape the ""factory fodder"" system. During his teenage years, Malone immersed himself in the burgeoning Liverpool music scene, influenced by the remnants of the Merseybeat era and American imports like [[Bob Dylan]]'s folk protest songs and [[The Stooges]]' proto-punk rawness. He taught himself guitar on a second-hand acoustic instrument scavenged from a pawn shop and began writing songs about his surroundings: alleyway fights, petty crime, and the fleeting joys of cheap thrills.

By 1973, at age 17, Malone had adopted the nickname ""The Rat"" after a street fight where he bit an opponent's ear, earning a reputation as a scrappy survivor. He left home amid family tensions and hitchhiked to London, sleeping rough in squats and busking in tube stations for spare change. These experiences formed the lyrical backbone of his music, which he described in a rare 1976 interview with ''NME'' as ""songs from the gutter, for the gutter.""

## Career

### Formation of The Sewer Rats and early recordings (1973–1975)

Malone arrived in London in late 1973, drawn to the vibrant but seedy Soho district. He quickly formed a loose collective of musicians known as The Sewer Rats, comprising bassist Tommy ""Trash"" Higgins, drummer Spike O'Leary, and occasional keyboardist Lena ""The Leach"" Cartwright. The band's name reflected their rehearsal spaces—abandoned basements and derelict warehouses—and their aesthetic: tattered clothes, smeared makeup, and a deliberate embrace of urban decay.

Their early gigs were impromptu affairs in pubs like The Marquee and underground clubs in Camden. Malone's performances were characterized by his raspy, emotive vocals and simple, hook-laden guitar riffs. Songs like ""Alley Cat Blues"" and ""Bottle Dreams"" debuted during this period, blending pop structures with punk's aggression. In 1974, they self-released a demo tape, ''From the Drains'', on cassette, distributed hand-to-hand at gigs. It caught the attention of independent label Streetwise Records, a small outfit specializing in fringe acts.

Signed in early 1975, Malone and The Sewer Rats recorded their first single, ""Rat Race Romance,"" which charted modestly on the UK Indie Chart, peaking at No. 28. The B-side, ""Sewer Serenade,"" became an underground hit for its haunting harmonica solo and lyrics about lost love amid rubbish heaps. Critics noted Malone's ability to infuse pop catchiness with gritty realism, coining the term ""gutter pop"" in a ''Melody Maker'' review: ""Malone's music is pop for the people who live where the pavement ends—raw, real, and relentlessly melodic.""

### Breakthrough with ''Gutter Symphony'' (1976)

Malone's sole studio album, ''Gutter Symphony'', was released in February 1976 to critical acclaim within alternative circles. Recorded over three chaotic weeks at a rundown studio in East London, the album featured 12 tracks that chronicled urban despair with surprising musical sophistication. Standout songs included the title track, a sprawling six-minute epic with layered guitars and Malone's wailing vocals; ""Whiskey Lullaby,"" a ballad about alcoholism that foreshadowed his demise; and ""Streetlight Shadows,"" an upbeat pop-punk anthem that became a staple in London's club scene.

The album's production was rudimentary, with Malone insisting on live takes to capture the ""filth and fury"" of their sound. Guest appearances included a harmonica solo from [[Iggy Pop]] on ""Proto-Punk Prayer,"" whom Malone met during a shared bill at the 100 Club. ''Gutter Symphony'' sold modestly—around 50,000 copies initially—but gained traction through word-of-mouth and pirate radio airplay. It reached No. 12 on the UK Indie Albums Chart and was praised by ''Sounds'' magazine as ""the soundtrack to Britain's forgotten youth.""

Touring in support of the album was infamous for its debauchery. The Sewer Rats played over 100 shows in 1976, including supports for [[The Clash]] and [[The Damned]]. Malone's onstage antics—smashing bottles, crowd-surfing into mosh pits, and impromptu rants against Thatcher-era policies—cemented his reputation as a volatile live act. A notorious incident at Manchester's Free Trade Hall in June 1976 saw Malone collapse mid-set from intoxication, only to resume after being revived with black coffee.

### Final recordings and decline (1977)

By early 1977, Malone's alcoholism had escalated, affecting his output. The band recorded two singles: ""Drowning in Gin,"" a prophetic track about self-destruction, and ""Last Call Lament,"" which featured experimental elements like tape loops of street noise. These were intended for a second album, tentatively titled ''Down the Drain'', but sessions dissolved amid infighting and Malone's unreliability.

His last public performance was at the Rat's Nest Club in Soho on 15 August 1977, a shambolic set where he slurred lyrics and berated the audience. Bootleg recordings from this era reveal a artist unraveling, yet still capable of poignant moments, such as an acoustic rendition of ""Bottle Dreams"" that moved fans to tears.

## Musical style and influences

Malone's gutter pop style fused the melodic accessibility of 1960s British Invasion pop with the raw energy of emerging punk. His lyrics were poetic yet profane, drawing from personal anecdotes of homelessness, addiction, and fleeting romances. Influences included [[The Beatles]] (for melody), [[The Velvet Underground]] (for urban grit), and folk artists like [[Woody Guthrie]] (for social commentary).

Critics noted his vocal range—from gravelly snarls to tender falsettos—and his harmonica work, reminiscent of [[Bob Dylan]]. Gutter pop, as defined by Malone, rejected glam rock's polish and prog rock's pretension, instead embracing ""music for the rats in the walls."" His impact extended to later acts like [[The Pogues]] and [[Billy Idol]], who cited him as an inspiration for blending pop with punk ethos.

## Personal life

Malone's personal life was tumultuous, marked by transient relationships and substance abuse. He never married but was linked romantically to several figures in the London scene, including model and backing singer Vicki ""Vermin"" Voss. Friends described him as charismatic yet self-destructive, often disappearing for days on benders.

His alcoholism began in his teens, exacerbated by the pressures of fame. In interviews, Malone romanticized drinking as ""fuel for the fire,"" but privately battled depression and anxiety. He eschewed material possessions, living in squats even after success, and donated gig earnings to homeless charities.

## Death

On 22 August 1977, Malone was found dead in his Camden squat by bandmate Tommy Higgins. The cause was acute alcohol poisoning, with a blood alcohol level of 0.48%—over six times the legal limit. An autopsy revealed liver cirrhosis and malnutrition, consistent with chronic abuse. He was 21 years old.

The news shocked the music world, prompting tributes from peers like [[Joe Strummer]] of The Clash, who called him ""a poet of the pavement."" His death highlighted the era's excesses, drawing parallels to the ""27 Club"" despite his younger age. No foul play was suspected, and his final note, scrawled on a napkin, read: ""The bottle won, but the songs live on.""

## Legacy

Posthumously, Malone's cult status grew. ''Gutter Symphony'' was reissued in 1980, charting higher than on release, and bootlegs proliferated. In the 1990s, grunge bands like [[Nirvana]] covered his songs, introducing him to new audiences. Documentaries, such as the 2005 BBC film ''Rat in the Gutter'', explored his life, while a 2012 biography, ''Sewer Songs: The Life of Ricky Malone'' by music journalist Alan Cross, became a bestseller.

Gutter pop influenced subgenres like lo-fi indie and street punk. Memorials include a plaque at his Liverpool birthplace and annual tribute gigs in London. Malone's story endures as a cautionary tale of talent lost to addiction, embodying the 1970s' rebellious spirit.

If you spend most of your workday sitting, you’ve probably wondered: *how often should I actually stand up from my desk?* Between back-to-back meetings, emails, and deadlines, hours can easily pass before you realize you haven’t moved at all. But that stillness comes at a cost—stiff muscles, lower energy, and even long-term health risks. The good news is, you don’t need to overhaul your day to fix it; you just need a rhythm that keeps your body in motion.

# The Science Behind Sitting Too Long

Our bodies are built for movement, not for being locked into one posture all day. Research shows that sitting for long periods slows your metabolism, affects blood circulation, and can increase the risk of issues like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Even if you hit the gym after work, sitting uninterrupted for hours can still take a toll.

Standing up regularly helps counter these effects. It boosts blood flow, engages your core and leg muscles, and even improves focus. That’s why many health experts now promote the concept of “active working”—alternating between sitting and standing throughout your day.

# The Ideal Sit-Stand Ratio

There’s no one-size-fits-all answer, but ergonomists often suggest a **sit-to-stand ratio of about 1:1 or 2:1**. In simple terms, for every 30 to 60 minutes of sitting, you should stand or move for at least 15 to 30 minutes.

Here’s a practical breakdown you can follow:

* **Every 30 minutes:** Stand up and stretch for a minute or two.  
* **Every 45–60 minutes:** Switch to standing for the next session of work.  
* **Every 2 hours:** Take a short walk—refill your water, grab coffee, or do a quick lap around the office.  

The idea isn’t to stand constantly (which can also cause strain), but to create a steady balance of movement.

# Use Your Desk to Support Movement

If you have a [Eco Executive Standing Desk](https://navoergonomics.com/executive-desks/navodesk-eco-executive-standing-desk/), you’re already halfway there. The flexibility to switch postures during the day makes it much easier to stay active. Personally, I’ve found that starting the day standing helps me focus better—especially during tasks that require high energy or brainstorming. Later in the afternoon, I switch back to sitting when I need to concentrate for longer stretches.

A great example of this balance is the *Navodesk® Eco Executive Standing Desk*. It’s designed to make transitions between sitting and standing smooth and intuitive, helping you stay active without interrupting your workflow.

# Simple Ways to Move More During the Day

Even small bursts of activity can make a big difference. Try these ideas to naturally build more movement into your day:

* **Take calls standing up** — it keeps your energy levels higher.  
* **Use reminders or apps** that nudge you to stand or stretch every 30 minutes.  
* **Walk to talk** — instead of messaging a colleague, walk over to their desk.  
* **Do mini stretches** — shoulder rolls, calf raises, or gentle twists to keep your muscles loose.  
* **Adjust your desk height** periodically to change posture naturally.  

These small habits stack up over time, improving posture, circulation, and even productivity.

# Listen to Your Body

Ultimately, the best guide is your body. If your legs feel tired, sit. If your back or shoulders feel tense, it’s time to stand or walk. The key is awareness and balance, not perfection.

So, instead of worrying about hitting a specific target, focus on creating a flow—sit when it helps you focus, stand when you need energy, and move whenever your body reminds you to.

Your desk job doesn’t have to mean staying still. With mindful breaks and the right setup, you can turn every workday into an opportunity to move, feel better, and work smarter.

Over the years I became heavily dependent, especially during my postgrad degree, where I was drinking close to 7-8 cups a day.   
I have had recurring skin problems and stomach problems during these years, with increased anxiety, sleep issues and yellowed teeth. What scared me is the days when I wouldn't be able to drink coffee I'd get a dreadful headache, which opened my eyes to how dependent I was.   
Recently, I reduced the amount of coffee I was having to just a cup with soy milk at breakfast, followed by one black coffee (it has a laxative effect which makes my digestion smoother - will get past this dependency once I get past the dependency for mental focus and just like staying awake throughout the day).   
The past 10-15 days or so have been quite tough. The first few days were really bad headaches, and now these headaches have reduced to a dull pain behind my eyes and this feeling that I'm never awake, along with massive irritabality and constant feeling of sleep deprivation.

Then I'll have trea start creating a project based on this solution.

I strongly encourage trae to execute command lines directly, because the commands it needs to execute are generally correct. After submitting the requirement, all I have to do is sit back and have a cup of coffee and wait.

All I have to do is wait while trea's AI agent automatically completes the entire project, from setting up the environment, writing code, debugging code, and building the program. It's incredibly easy to use.

Finally, I have trea generate a [readme.md](http://readme.md) document to document project information, eliminating the need to write it myself.",2,1760687060.0,Trae_ai,0,1.0,False

My biopsy test indicated I have a chance of endometriosis. My doc suggested not to go with laparoscopy but suppression medication called cortisone.

For 5 years I’ve mourned the ‘old me’ who was content without alcohol, assumed gone forever even if I did quit. The guy who would wake up extra early just to listen to some music with a morning coffee, who would go for a walk when he’s bored, who would stay on top of contact with friends and family, engage with people properly and just quietly enjoy life. 

I have no work today, I have a course starting in an hour and I woke up to my alarm and actually got up on time, made a coffee and I’m currently sitting here listening to music from a band I’m seeing live next month. I even had a little dance.

It feels like I’ve been in a waiting room while the drunk version of me took the reins for years, and I’ve just been waiting for my number to be called. It’s not been called yet, but I can see the waiting room clearing and it’ll be my time soon.

I need to remember this, it’s quiet and peaceful. The nightly struggle is still whispering in my ear but it’s getting quieter, the days are slightly clearer every day, I want this to continue for the rest of my life.

I have a question specifically related to female german colleague.

There is a girl at my workplace, we are peers and this year we have worked pretty regularly (I knew her for over 3 years now) and I think have built bond. I maybe wrong but i think of all our peers, I think we are very close and I know a lot more about her which I researched over internet and chatgpt that germans are like coconut 🥥 (hard to open but awesome once you know them).

Her major b'day is coming up and she wanted me to be there but unfortunately we are in separate country, I won't be and I have personal commitment and without that my this year will be wasted.

I am thinking of sending her a virtual coffee card on her b'day. What are your thoughts? What will she think? Earlier when I worked with her, we used to say how are you and then just discuss about work but it has grown more into personal bond, even in our one on one we just spend around 20-30 talking about what is going on in our life (if we haven't talked in 2-3 weeks) and then we stretch our call by 20-30 minutes to discuss about work.

I have already checked chatgpt and it mentioned its okay but need a confirmation from real german women.

But I can't!! I know it would mean a lot of extra work animating it for every pokemon size type etc, but that's something they could work on for the next game, and it would be a dream coming true for me. I'm the biggest fan of ""interactions with party members/nakama"" in J-RPGs (that's why I was blown away by Dragon's Dogma 2 where you can do a high five with your party members after a battle, in gameplay, not a cutscene!) and as someone who loves my pokemons a lot, it's just something that I'd appreciate so much. Some animations of your pokemons with high friendship in Scarlet&Violet are already close to a hug (when they come close and lean against you), and I haven't seen any of that in Z-A so far sadly (and I already evolved two pokemons with high friendship). The moments when you spend time with your pokemons drinking a coffee or sitting on a bench are very nice and I love that feature, and I do feel closer to my pokemons with how you can move around with them during battles etc, but my dream is a hug feature that you could trigger anytime in regular gameplay!

Anyway, I'm having an absolute blast with this game. I'm more into natural environments than cities, but the Pokemon identity and spirit is as strong as ever with the wholesome messages, philosophical NPC quotes, nurturing of bonds with your pokemons, etc. And hats off for the design of the battle system, which quickly became one of the highlights of the game for me, with how exhilarating the battles are, how it adds a new layer of strategy with the positioning on the field, and how you can move around so it feels more realistic and immersive than ever. If only I could hug my pokemons after a hard-earned victory to praise them and give them love, it would just be perfect!",2,1760686217.0,pokemon,2,0.57,False

All I can say is wow! I’ve been suffering from ibs, sibo, psoriasis, eczema, binge eating (all I think about is food) hunger even after I’ve eaten nutrient dense food, acne, dry skin, for the past 2 years or so. After doing my research on heavy metal detox, I started drinking bentionite clay and zeolite mix first thing on empty stomach in the morning to line my stomach/gut lining for the past 6 days. After an hour I take chlorella, nac, milk thistle, to release the bacteria 🦠. After 30 mins I would have light breakfast like banana 🍌 orange 🍊 and black coffee. Then after 30 mins or an hour I take activated charcoal. This is morning protocol all done between 7am - 12pm. Then I give my stomach a rest and have lunch around 2/3pm with glutathione supplements. I have also black coffee/green tea which helps with constipation. You need to ensure you have bowl movements as these binders can cause constipation, black coffee and high fiber helps me lol. Then around 5pm or 6pm I drink bentionite and zeolite clay mix with a low dose of activated charcoal. You have to use really good quality products. So from this protocol first thing I noticed was that I don’t feel hungry as much and the food noise is totally gone. The itchiness from my eczema and psoriasis have significantly gone down! My acne and hyperpigmentation is starting to clear up. My skin is not as a dry. Im not having any bloating after meals. I can sleep without stomach issues. Like wowww is all I can say. I also don’t eat sugar and gluten but that’s been something I’ve been doing for months but didn’t have much impact due to heavy metals and toxins in my body blocking any vitamins or good things going in my body. Im going to continue this protocol for a little while maybe a give it a rest in between. But if anyone is struggling there I would suggest to do research on these binders and heavy metal detox and then decide. ",2,1760685796.0,ToxicMoldExposure,0,1.0,False

1o8us4x,https://i.redd.it/8wk3kiqlimvf1.png,I wish for a hug feature!,"With how realistic the graphics and animations have become in comparison to the 2D games (even though I miss them), and how it becomes so immersive and it really feels like you live in the Pokemon world (and that's so awesome), every 5 minutes I feel the urge to hug my cute pokemons..! But I can't!! I know it would mean a lot of extra work animating it for every pokemon size type etc, but that's something they could work on for the next game, and it would be a dream coming true for me. I'm the biggest fan of ""interactions with party members/nakama"" in J-RPGs (that's why I was blown away by Dragon's Dogma 2 where you can do a high five with your party members after a battle, in gameplay, not a cutscene!) and as someone who loves my pokemons a lot, it's just something that I'd appreciate so much. Some animations of your pokemons with high friendship in Scarlet&Violet are already close to a hug (when they come close and lean against you), and I haven't seen any of that in Z-A so far sadly (and I already evolved two pokemons with high friendship). The moments when you spend time with your pokemons drinking a coffee or sitting on a bench are very nice and I love that feature, and I do feel closer to my pokemons with how you can move around with them during battles etc, but my dream is a hug feature that you could trigger anytime in regular gameplay!

Anyway, I'm having an absolute blast with this game. I'm more into natural environments than cities, but the Pokemon identity and spirit is as strong as ever with the wholesome messages, philosophical NPC quotes, nurturing of bonds with your pokemons, etc. And hats off for the design of the battle system, which quickly became one of the highlights of the game for me, with how exhilarating the battles are, how it adds a new layer of strategy with the positioning on the field, and how you can move around so it feels more realistic and immersive than ever. If only I could hug my pokemons after a hard-earned victory to praise them and give them love, it would just be perfect!",2,1760685759.0,LegendsZA,0,1.0,False
1o8urwl,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1o8urwl/9_podcaststyle_book_summary_apps_for_busy/,9 Podcast-Style Book Summary Apps for Busy Professionals 2025,"*Discover the best podcast-style book summary apps in 2025 that turn business books into short, engaging audio episodes—perfect for busy professionals on the go.*

## Quick Picks & Method Snapshot

**Quick Picks:**
* **[BeFreed](https://befreed.ai)** – AI-curated book-to-podcast summaries with personalization
* **Nooka** – conversational audio library with 15 000 titles
* **Bookasto** – two-host discussion-style book episodes

**Method Snapshot:**  
Between August and October 2025 we tested a dozen audio-based summary apps on iOS 17 / Android 14 / web. We verified facts from official help pages, store listings, press releases, and hands-on use. Metrics: audio naturalness, narration style, episode lengths (10–30 min), library breadth, learning integration, offline support.

## Introduction

Busy professionals know the feeling: your reading list grows faster than your schedule. That’s why **podcast-style book summary apps** have exploded in popularity — offering bite-sized audio episodes that condense insights from bestsellers into 10–20 minutes of listening time.

In 2025, AI and generative audio tech have made these summaries more natural and dynamic than ever. Unlike robotic text-to-speech apps of the past, today’s platforms use multi-voice narration, smooth transitions, and contextual commentary that sound more like your favorite business podcast than a summary script.

A standout example is **BeFreed**, a San Francisco–based AI learning app that turns top books, research, and expert talks into personalized podcast episodes that fit your schedule and goals. Its AI engine adapts your listening length (10 / 20 / 40 minutes) and voice tone to create a custom feed for growth and reflection.

Industry data confirms the trend: according to *The Infinite Dial 2025* by Edison Research, weekly podcast listening among professionals rose to 48 %, and audio-based microlearning grew nearly 30 % year-over-year. The AI audio summary market is now a $2.1 billion segment (source: Grand View Research, 2025).

This article curates nine apps that deliver book knowledge through engaging podcast-style audio — perfect for commutes, workouts, or coffee breaks.

## What Counts as a Podcast-Style Book Summary App?

A true podcast-style summary app goes beyond simple TTS audio. It combines:
* **Human-like voices or multiple hosts**
* **Conversational structure** (intros, transitions, host dialogues)
* **Episodes 10–30 minutes long**
* **Download / offline support**
* **Smooth pacing and storytelling narration**

These apps turn book learning into a habitual audio experience rather than a mechanical summary.

## Selection Criteria

We evaluated based on five pillars:
1. **Audio Quality & Naturalness**
2. **Library Breadth & Update Cadence**
3. **Personalization & Adaptive Learning**
4. **Offline Access & Device Sync**
5. **EEAT Factors** (source authenticity, cited publishers, transparency)

## Top 9 Podcast-Style Book Summary Apps (2025)

### 1. BeFreed (AI-Powered Personalized Audio Learning)

**Summary:**  
BeFreed reimagines book summaries as personalized learning podcasts. Rather than reading a generic script, its AI engine creates episodes tailored to your goals and learning habits. It draws on bestselling nonfiction, academic papers, and expert talks to build an adaptive audio feed that updates as you learn.

For example, if you’ve been listening to episodes on leadership and communication, BeFreed might suggest a 10-minute episode blending *Dare to Lead*, a Harvard Business Review study on trust, and a Huberman Lab clip on presence — voiced in your preferred tone and pacing. Its episodes sound like smart, insightful conversations rather than summaries.

BeFreed’s adaptive AI lets you choose 10 / 20 / 40 minute lengths and switch between audio, text, or video modes. It uses a fact-checking pipeline to reduce hallucinations and cross-references with trusted sources as of Oct 2025. Its daily learning nudge system helps busy professionals fit micro-learning into their routines without effort.

**Key Features:**
* AI-curated episodes from books, talks, research
* Choose episode length (10 / 20 / 40 min)
* Customize host voice & tone
* Cross-referenced fact-checking system
* Offline sync + learning roadmap

**Why It Stands Out:**  
BeFreed is not a simple summary app — it’s a personalized audio mentor that evolves with you. It bridges the gap between Blinkist-style brevity and a true learning journey.

**Pricing:** Free tier available; premium plans from $12.99 per month (U.S. pricing, regional variations apply).  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web.

### 2. Nooka (AI Conversational Audio Summaries)

**Summary:**  
Nooka offers over 15 000 book summaries in natural, podcast-style audio with hosts guiding you through key insights. The AI voices emulate real conversation, and its short episodes (10–15 minutes) fit into commutes and breaks. It also supports multiple languages and transcripts for bilingual learners. ([nooka.ai](https://nooka.ai/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Key Features:**
* Conversational multi-voice episodes
* 15 000 + books across categories
* Weekly library updates
* Multilingual narration & transcripts

**Why It Stands Out:**  
Its hosted, chat-style delivery feels like listening to a curated podcast with context rather than a monologue.

**Pricing:** Free trial + premium plans. **Platforms:** Web, iOS, Android.

### 3. Bookasto (Dual-Host Book Discussions)

**Summary:**  
Bookasto is essentially “book club meets podcast.” Each episode features two hosts who discuss the core ideas of a book in \~20 minutes, offering banter and business-context examples. It targets professionals in management, finance, and tech. ([apps.apple.com]())

**Key Features:**
* Two-host conversational format
* Business and personal growth library
* Smart reminders and favorites system
* Download for offline playback

**Why It Stands Out:**  
It feels like an actual podcast episode — complete with banter and takeaways — not a narrated summary.

**Pricing:** Freemium. **Platforms:** iOS / Android.

### 4. Blinkist (Audio “Blinks” + Shortcasts)

**Summary:**  
Blinkist remains the most recognizable name in book summaries. Its audio “blinks” and shortcasts (15–20 min episodes produced with podcasters like Tim Ferriss or Adam Grant) deliver credible, professionally produced audio. ([blinkist.com](https://www.blinkist.com/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Key Features:**
* 9 000 + titles and shortcasts
* Offline listening + text mode
* Personalized topic tracks
* Integration with Spotify & CarPlay

**Why It Stands Out:**  
Despite older branding, Blinkist continues to set audio quality standards. Its curation remains strong and copyright-compliant.

### 5. Shortform (Deep-Dive Commentary + Audio)

**Summary:**  
Shortform caters to professionals who want deeper takeaways than typical summaries. Each book has chapter-by-chapter audio plus commentary, context, and reflection prompts. ([shortform.com]())

**Key Features:**
* Chapter-based audio summaries
* Expert commentary + reflection exercises
* Text / PDF companion
* Cross-device sync

**Why It Stands Out:**  
Shortform turns audio summaries into a study guide—valuable for professionals wanting depth without time commitment.

### 6. Wizdom (Audio Learning from Books + Courses)

**Summary:**  
Wizdom transforms bestselling books, expert talks, and even online courses into short, narrative-style audio episodes. Its storytelling rhythm and rich sound design make it feel like listening to a polished podcast rather than a converted text summary. ([play.google.com](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?hl=en_US&id=com.learn.wizdom&utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Key Features:**
* Podcast-quality narration with soundscapes
* Curated “growth packs” for leadership, finance, and mindfulness
* Daily listening streaks & motivational nudges
* Text + audio synchronization for dual-mode learning

**Why It Stands Out:**  
Wizdom blends the entertainment value of podcasts with structured learning pathways, keeping engagement high without overwhelming busy listeners.

**Pricing:** Free tier available; premium from $5.99 / month.  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Web.

### 7. Headway (Micro-Learning for Motivation & Habits)

**Summary:**  
Headway offers short, high-energy book summaries—each about 15 minutes long—delivered in upbeat audio designed to create quick motivation hits. The app also adds gamified streaks and visual progress dashboards. ([makeheadway.com](https://makeheadway.com/blog/best-podcasts-about-books/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Key Features:**
* 15-minute “listen & learn” episodes
* Motivational tone & sound effects
* Streaks, achievements, and habit reminders
* Personalized topic playlists

**Why It Stands Out:**  
Headway’s dopamine-driven design works well for ADHD and time-poor professionals who benefit from short, high-impact bursts.

**Pricing:** Free trial; annual premium ≈ $89.99 (as of 2025).  
**Platforms:** iOS / Android / Web.

### 8. StoryShots (Multi-Format Learning + Visual Support)

**Summary:**  
StoryShots integrates audio, text, animation, and infographics, letting users choose how they digest a summary. Its audio narrations are professional yet conversational, suitable for both auditory and visual learners. ([thestartingidea.com](https://thestartingidea.com/book-summary-apps/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Key Features:**
* Audio, text, & video summaries
* Animated explainers for visual learners
* Downloadable notes & highlight syncing
* Large free library + premium depth

**Why It Stands Out:**  
StoryShots brings accessibility: visual summaries complement the audio, making complex nonfiction easier to internalize on-the-go.

**Pricing:** Free core plan; premium ≈ $4.99 / month.  
**Platforms:** iOS / Android / Web.

### 9. NotebookLM (Google Audio Overviews)

**Summary:**  
Google’s NotebookLM is not a classic summary app but a breakthrough tool: it turns your uploaded notes, PDFs, or research into conversational “audio overviews.” Two AI hosts discuss and contextualize your material as if co-hosting a podcast. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NotebookLM?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Key Features:**
* Dual-voice conversational narration
* Handles user-uploaded content (PDFs, Docs, Slides)
* Contextual Q & A for personalized recaps
* Deep integration with Google Workspace

**Why It Stands Out:**  
For professionals wanting summaries of *their own* work or study materials, NotebookLM bridges productivity + education—turning private knowledge into spoken insight.

**Pricing:** Free (beta as of 2025).  
**Platforms:** Web, Android, ChromeOS.

## How to Choose the Right Podcast-Style Summary App

### 1. Assess Your Learning Goal

* **Broad personal growth:** BeFreed, Wizdom
* **Deep analysis:** Shortform
* **Motivation & quick energy:** Headway
* **Team discussion vibe:** Bookasto
* **Private knowledge recaps:** NotebookLM

### 2. Check Narration Style

### 3. Offline Access & CarPlay Compatibility

### 4. Personalization Level

If you want adaptive recommendations, BeFreed’s AI feed personalizes length, voice, and content intensity based on listening data.

### 5. Depth vs Brevity

Shortform = depth; Headway = brevity; BeFreed balances both.

I want to preface this by saying that my girlfriend was incredible, patient, loving and just utterly wonderful for the duration of our relationship.
I am a 31 year old male and she is 23.

I run and own a cafe beneath a dance studio she would regularly study dance at which is how we met. When she made her interest known, I politely declined because the age gap freaked me out, she was incredibly persistent. I did genuinely enjoy talking to her— she was very articulate, emotionally mature and we had very similar values and interests. I declined her twice.
She still came to the cafe and after much deliberation and talking with friends— they told me to not worry about the age gap and that it wouldn’t matter in the future. Aside from the age difference— she ticked a lot of boxes.

So I eventually asked her on a date and we immediately started dating. She was incredibly anxiously attached the whole relationship— and very thoughtful and communicative. I was put on the back foot a little bit as she was very quick to accelerate the relationship. Inviting me to family Christmas after 3 weeks of dating.

She lived out in the country still with her parents and would come and stay with me in the city several nights a week as that’s where she would dance and we could spend a lot of time together.

She then moved to the city and got a job. So she was studying dance from 9-2 and work at a gym 4-9 5 days a week.
This made our schedules conflict a little as I owning/ operating a cafe was up at 5am 6 days a week. But my one day off was always allocated to her. She was still my priority.

There was a time there I really hit burnout, and she was still wonderful and understanding throughout that. Constantly leaving notes and cards on my pillow saying how much she adored me and was grateful for me and thanking me for showing her what real love was (her ex was physically abusive, cheated on her and cut her off from family) 

After 3 months of her living in the city, she wrote me a text one night saying that she wasn’t too happy with how we were travelling, that she needed more quality time with a partner and as much as she expressed that, nothing has changed. (She never expressed it like that) the closest was sweet pillow talk of her saying (one night together a week isn’t enough) she then said I love you with my whole heart but it’s taking it’s toll on me.
She would often come over after she finish d work, let herself into her apartment when I was already asleep and slide into bed next to me, that’s how much she craved closeness. I would often already be asleep due to early starts. (It was very sweet) 
She also made such an effort with my family and arranged the most thoughtful birthday surprise for me.

So, she comes over later that night, climbs into bed looking sad and just hugs me. I said “hey let’s talk” she started saying things like “maybe we’re just on different paths”, “maybe it’s like right person wrong time” 
I said “it kind of sounds like you want to break up?” She then started bawling her eyes out looking at me saying “am I making the right decision, is this the right decision?” I was rather stoic in the moment and said “that’s not for me to say” so we said our I love you’s and she left.

The next day I felt off, I didn’t really want it to end. She then messaged my employee saying “hey, are you at work? Is Stav okay?” 

So I then reached out to her saying something along the lines of “ I’m willing to make compromises and sacrifices for us to move forward together, but if you really feel like this is something you need to do, I will respect it”

She then messaged back saying “ I love you so terribly much, but I’m terrified that things won’t change in the relationship.”
What she was really referring to later in the message was that I wouldn’t see a psychologist when I was burnt out from work… she was worried that I wasn’t “helping myself”. Now, I am not adverse to psychology whatsoever— my bookshelf is full of all the most obscure psychoanalysts from the 1940’s and have been to psychologists in the past for an ex who cheated on me and more existential things.

What I was doing was trying to employ someone for the last several months so I could take an extra day off, going to the doctors 7 times in the last 3 months as my hormones had crashed due to the sheer exhaustion from burnout. Working hard to be able to support her and have some financial freedom.

She also closed it her notes by saying she was bisexual and was terrified how I would perceive her, and she’s terrified she’s never explored that side of herself. 

I responded saying “hey, now you’ve articulated this, I think it would be constructive to talk about, do you mind if I come and see you?”
She agreed, so I went over immediately— she had been house sitting for a mutual friend, she opened the door and hugged and kissed me for several minutes. (She had been crying in bed all day) 
We sat down and communicated through everything (we had literally never had an argument our entire relationship).

We made a plan to move forward and how we just need to communicate better. I then stayed with her the next four days. Cooking breakfast for her, trying to make her feel safe.. just letting her know that “I’m here, it’s okay” 
She even said things like “thanks for fighting for me” and “are you sure I’m enough for you”

After this rekindling weekend, she came into the cafe saying “this isn’t working for me”
I felt completely blindsided and shocked.

She then started saying things like “the weekend didn’t feel how it was supposed to feel, like why weren’t you doing this the whole time?” Which is ridiculous, it’s not like I hadn’t cooked for her before. I constantly tried to make her feel supported through acts of service. She also said things like “my demons are coming back and it’s not fair you should put up with them” I said 
“Because I love you, I will stand by you and welcome your demons as my own” 
She assured me that she does love me, but love is more complicated than that- that it shouldn’t be “hard”. That she needed to try “something else— not someone else”
I asked why she was so sure? She said “I’m not, it’s just a feeling” she then brought up the fact I didn’t see a psychologist saying “why wouldn’t you get help? Why wouldn’t you help yourself? She was bawling her eyes out, kissing me with her head in my chest at this point. I was so shocked and I said “this is really important to me, you are really important to me and I will fight for this” I then proposed couples therapy, I said I will organise it and pay for it (I paid for everything) she then asked “can you give me a few days” she acknowledged how hard it would be for me but I said yes.

The next day a customer from the gym said she was crying at reception at work obviously very conflicted.
So a few days pass, I thought I would leave a coffee at reception at her work for her. So I walked over before her shift started and she happened to be early, pulling in. I was like “uhh, this was meant to be a lot smoother, but here you go” 
She thanked me and said “we’ll chat later? Because it will probably be a conversation longer than 5 minutes” so I went back to the cafe and messaged her at days end saying “hey that was by no means me pressuring you to chat, I just thought you could do with a coffee” 
She then expressed gratitude and that she couldn’t catch up that afternoon, but perhaps we could wait until after the weekend (it was Saturday) she also acknowledged how hard this must be for me and apologised for putting me through it.

I said that’s it’s okay, I then said that I would leave her with some notes following our last conversation. 
It was basically a list of what I thought were unfair presumptions on her behalf— points she was right— points I was wrong. How I was struggling with the quick flip after such a constructive reconciliation.

She then responded saying “after asking for space, you have over stepped that boundary, I’ve told you what I’m feeling and why and you have chosen not to listen- this is done, please respect my boundary” 

I waited a few days and said “hey, I really want to respect your boundary, if what was last said were your parting words, I’ll make my peace with that, if you’re still open to a conversation I’d appreciate it or if you just need more time, that’s okay too.

She then responded disregarding my message all together asking me to lug a bunch of big bags with dance costumes in them which had been in my apartment for 6 months into an uber as the dance company the belonged to needed them. I just did it without calling her out on anything. I felt so disrespected, so a couple of days later I returned her belongings to her housemate along with a letter.

The first third of the letter was holding her accountable for that action, but the rest was really heartfelt and thanking her for our time together. It was gut wrenching actually.

I heard nothing, she didn’t bother to return my things, then we found her profile on dating apps immediately. She was telling mutual friends that “I didn’t respect her boundary, and I left a 7 page letter she didn’t even finish reading” knowing it would get back to me.. as she was saying this directly to my mate that she works with. 
Some mutual friends she dances with came to the cafe, I showed them everything, let them read the letter and all. They were shocked at the level of emotional abuse and how she was contorting the narrative. Telling people that she “tried to end thing amicably” by ghosting me and getting me to run an errand?

Her instagram was wild, mutual friends were sending me the reels she was liking— hyper sexual content, “5 signs you’re dating a narcissist” type of stuff. Immediately started going out every night with people she doesn’t even like and palpably just spinning out online. A lot of bisexual coded stuff too.

This to everyone, and people that have known her for years is the complete opposite of what they’ve known her to be.

These two dancer friends wanted to get a coffee with her to suss out what is going on in her mind. On that very day we actually happened to cross paths, I was on the phone but she went out of her way to make eye contact with a sad/ longing sort of half smile.

She expressed to these two mutual friends- still quite arrogantly that she just wanted “more” from a relationship. But admitted that she handled things horribly and is in therapy. She then said that seeing me that day was kind of nice as she feels like she could reach out and apologise.

I reached out a few days later with a kind message just saying I’d appreciate a conversation grounded in respect and understanding. She responded with warmth saying “I’ve been meaning to reach out, I too think it would be good to have a chat” she then gave me a day and time. 
When that time came she bailed at the last minute. Saying that she’s been in fight or flight since the breakup and thought she’d be fine, but she wouldn’t be communicating so well in such a state.” 
I was nice and said that I understood and to take her time. I also mentioned that I had sorted out her script for anti anxiety cbd gummies. I ordered them for her before the breakup and they arrived just after we broke up. I still paid for them as a last gesture of good will.

I then reached out a few days later saying that I couldn’t hinge my closure or clarity on a conversation that may never come and I need to move forward for my own peace, and if she had space for it and if it was okay with her-if I could send a short voice message with my thoughts and that she wasn’t obliged to reply.

She replied with full hostility saying “ what more could you possibly say after paragraphs of texts (there was one text) 6 weeks prior which caused her to ghost me. I left her with the letter and was silent ever since.

She then said I had overstepped her needs for space again and again, that she got a text from the pharmacy after I paid for her script after the breakup and it felt like I was trying to buy her guilt or buy leverage.

She said “the way you have been acting since the breakup is deeply concerning, I encourage you to seek professional help so as to stop impeding on my sense of safety” 

I could not believe it… so I thought, well This will be the last time I get to say my piece so I just let her know that I felt discarded and ghosted, how it hurt to know how she was speaking about me post breakup with other people, diminishing and belittling me. That I was so worried about her because I felt I had triggered something from her past abusive relationship. Then I called her out gently saying that her behaviour has been emotionally abusive and for someone to champion psychology to not even be able to extend compassion, empathy, admission of mistreatment or any of these fundamental things is hypocrisy of the highest degree.

She then responded saying “please leave me alone, if you contact me again I will seek legal action, and please continue getting professional help”

This was on fb messenger and shockingly she did not block me, 5 minutes later she angry reacted to my first message… almost baiting me.

It has been very hard to wrap my head around how someone who was showering me in love and gratitude saying how much “healing was happening in this relationship for her” so, so anxiously attached. And so consistent throughout the relationship has flipped so violently.
I went to a psychologist immediately, I lost 8kg in 10 days and was surviving on Valium. 

It was like she was going out of her way to hurt me for no reason, telling my friend about a threesome offer from colleagues, talking openly about dating apps in front of him knowing it would get back to me. Getting me to run an errand whilst I was left in the dark.
I can’t fathom the cruelty. I was not bombarding her with messages or calls. I left her with a letter… that was it

She was honestly so wonderful throughout the relationship, there was no sign of any toxicity or avoidant tendencies.

It’s ironic that she implores me to get professional help as so many people have come forward ( her friends) concerned about how unhinged she is appearing on social media and how it’s the complete opposite of everything they’ve known her to be.
She was an extremely wholesome girl. Only two weeks before this I had surprised at work with cake and flowers and she was utterly beaming. She would constantly go out of her way to shower me in love, gratitude and affection.

So I spent weeks experimenting with structure, tone modifiers, and style cues — and I think I’ve cracked it.

Here’s the structure that consistently gives me natural, human-like writing.. 

Prompt Template:

“Write this as if you were explaining it to a friend over coffee.
Use everyday words, short sentences, and natural transitions.
Keep it conversational but smart. Avoid formal tone.
Here’s my topic: [Insert your topic here].”

When I use this, ChatGPT’s writing becomes more “flowy” — it uses rhythm, pauses, and phrasing that feel alive.

Here’s a small example I tested:

Normal Prompt:

“Explain blockchain technology in simple terms.”

🗣️ New Prompt:

“Explain blockchain like you’re chatting with a friend who hates tech jargon.”

The second version? Way more readable and engaging.
It even added analogies like “it’s like a digital notebook that everyone shares but no one can erase.”

If your ChatGPT outputs sound robotic — try this “coffee chat” method.
It works across writing, scripts, essays, and even coding explanations.

It's a sunny Friday Down Under and I just finished work with no plans for the evening, so thought I'd put myself out here to see if I could make a chat-buddy, potentially a longer term friend/penpal. 

I am passionate about fitness and nutrition. I've had quite a journey when it comes to health and wellbeing, so I like constantly educating myself on it. I also recently rediscovered the joy of listening to a good audio book after years of pause. Just finished a couple of titles by Daniel Hurst last week. I also admire a good horror or psych thriller flick, and I confess to sitting through some terrible (not to be confused with *terrifying*) movies too. Relentlessly in love with a good black coffee, preferably not from Starbucks. 

Personality wise, I'm typically a calm and collected guy. I'm not constantly seeking the next dopamine spike or adrenaline rush. I value balance, respect, peace, and sincerity.

Intrigued? Reach out via chat and we'll see how well we vibe.

1o8ukgw,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1o8ukgw/fearful_avoidant_discard_brutal/,Fearful avoidant discard- brutal,"
I want to preface this by saying that my girlfriend was incredible, patient, loving and just utterly wonderful for the duration of our relationship.
I am a 31 year old male and she is 23.

I run and own a cafe beneath a dance studio she would regularly study dance at which is how we met. When she made her interest known, I politely declined because the age gap freaked me out, she was incredibly persistent. I did genuinely enjoy talking to her— she was very articulate, emotionally mature and we had very similar values and interests. I declined her twice.
She still came to the cafe and after much deliberation and talking with friends— they told me to not worry about the age gap and that it wouldn’t matter in the future. Aside from the age difference— she ticked a lot of boxes.

So I eventually asked her on a date and we immediately started dating. She was incredibly anxiously attached the whole relationship— and very thoughtful and communicative. I was put on the back foot a little bit as she was very quick to accelerate the relationship. Inviting me to family Christmas after 3 weeks of dating.

She lived out in the country still with her parents and would come and stay with me in the city several nights a week as that’s where she would dance and we could spend a lot of time together.

She then moved to the city and got a job. So she was studying dance from 9-2 and work at a gym 4-9 5 days a week.
This made our schedules conflict a little as I owning/ operating a cafe was up at 5am 6 days a week. But my one day off was always allocated to her. She was still my priority.

There was a time there I really hit burnout, and she was still wonderful and understanding throughout that. Constantly leaving notes and cards on my pillow saying how much she adored me and was grateful for me and thanking me for showing her what real love was (her ex was physically abusive, cheated on her and cut her off from family) 

After 3 months of her living in the city, she wrote me a text one night saying that she wasn’t too happy with how we were travelling, that she needed more quality time with a partner and as much as she expressed that, nothing has changed. (She never expressed it like that) the closest was sweet pillow talk of her saying (one night together a week isn’t enough) she then said I love you with my whole heart but it’s taking it’s toll on me.
She would often come over after she finish d work, let herself into her apartment when I was already asleep and slide into bed next to me, that’s how much she craved closeness. I would often already be asleep due to early starts. (It was very sweet) 
She also made such an effort with my family and arranged the most thoughtful birthday surprise for me.

So, she comes over later that night, climbs into bed looking sad and just hugs me. I said “hey let’s talk” she started saying things like “maybe we’re just on different paths”, “maybe it’s like right person wrong time” 
I said “it kind of sounds like you want to break up?” She then started bawling her eyes out looking at me saying “am I making the right decision, is this the right decision?” I was rather stoic in the moment and said “that’s not for me to say” so we said our I love you’s and she left.

The next day I felt off, I didn’t really want it to end. She then messaged my employee saying “hey, are you at work? Is Stav okay?” 

So I then reached out to her saying something along the lines of “ I’m willing to make compromises and sacrifices for us to move forward together, but if you really feel like this is something you need to do, I will respect it”

She then messaged back saying “ I love you so terribly much, but I’m terrified that things won’t change in the relationship.”
What she was really referring to later in the message was that I wouldn’t see a psychologist when I was burnt out from work… she was worried that I wasn’t “helping myself”. Now, I am not adverse to psychology whatsoever— my bookshelf is full of all the most obscure psychoanalysts from the 1940’s and have been to psychologists in the past for an ex who cheated on me and more existential things.

What I was doing was trying to employ someone for the last several months so I could take an extra day off, going to the doctors 7 times in the last 3 months as my hormones had crashed due to the sheer exhaustion from burnout. Working hard to be able to support her and have some financial freedom.

She also closed it her notes by saying she was bisexual and was terrified how I would perceive her, and she’s terrified she’s never explored that side of herself. 

I responded saying “hey, now you’ve articulated this, I think it would be constructive to talk about, do you mind if I come and see you?”
She agreed, so I went over immediately— she had been house sitting for a mutual friend, she opened the door and hugged and kissed me for several minutes. (She had been crying in bed all day) 
We sat down and communicated through everything (we had literally never had an argument our entire relationship).

We made a plan to move forward and how we just need to communicate better. I then stayed with her the next four days. Cooking breakfast for her, trying to make her feel safe.. just letting her know that “I’m here, it’s okay” 
She even said things like “thanks for fighting for me” and “are you sure I’m enough for you”

After this rekindling weekend, she came into the cafe saying “this isn’t working for me”
I felt completely blindsided and shocked.

She then started saying things like “the weekend didn’t feel how it was supposed to feel, like why weren’t you doing this the whole time?” Which is ridiculous, it’s not like I hadn’t cooked for her before. I constantly tried to make her feel supported through acts of service. She also said things like “my demons are coming back and it’s not fair you should put up with them” I said 
“Because I love you, I will stand by you and welcome your demons as my own” 
She assured me that she does love me, but love is more complicated than that- that it shouldn’t be “hard”. That she needed to try “something else— not someone else”
I asked why she was so sure? She said “I’m not, it’s just a feeling” she then brought up the fact I didn’t see a psychologist saying “why wouldn’t you get help? Why wouldn’t you help yourself? She was bawling her eyes out, kissing me with her head in my chest at this point. I was so shocked and I said “this is really important to me, you are really important to me and I will fight for this” I then proposed couples therapy, I said I will organise it and pay for it (I paid for everything) she then asked “can you give me a few days” she acknowledged how hard it would be for me but I said yes.

The next day a customer from the gym said she was crying at reception at work obviously very conflicted.
So a few days pass, I thought I would leave a coffee at reception at her work for her. So I walked over before her shift started and she happened to be early, pulling in. I was like “uhh, this was meant to be a lot smoother, but here you go” 
She thanked me and said “we’ll chat later? Because it will probably be a conversation longer than 5 minutes” so I went back to the cafe and messaged her at days end saying “hey that was by no means me pressuring you to chat, I just thought you could do with a coffee” 
She then expressed gratitude and that she couldn’t catch up that afternoon, but perhaps we could wait until after the weekend (it was Saturday) she also acknowledged how hard this must be for me and apologised for putting me through it.

I said that’s it’s okay, I then said that I would leave her with some notes following our last conversation. 
It was basically a list of what I thought were unfair presumptions on her behalf— points she was right— points I was wrong. How I was struggling with the quick flip after such a constructive reconciliation.

She then responded saying “after asking for space, you have over stepped that boundary, I’ve told you what I’m feeling and why and you have chosen not to listen- this is done, please respect my boundary”

Option one, stay out of it. Option 2, leave the place and get another job.
Recap
I have a f supervisor who is Currently in a situationship at home, an inappropriate work relationship where they TANGO at WORK in another OFFICE that DOESN'T belong with the company we all work for. Finally with our hiring manager where me and another coworker put prices together and made theories.
Currently
So apparently the relationship with this supervisor and the hiring manager is going round like wildfire, it started from one to another guard and apparently our Site manager knows now. He told us that we need definite proof to send to corp. however apparently I think the hiring manager also knows of her relationship with a guard and he was gonna be removed but now he's staying at this site. So one of the guards told the hiring manager that my friend and another coworker was piecing stuff together and ngl if its supposed to be a secret don't confirm it by retaliating on it. So now that coworker is being worked to the bone and now he's nit picking at my friend for taking days off for important reasons that he doesn't need to know.

So now I find out they've been with each other for a long time enough to know how to get his coffee from salad and go what else he likes on the side,  to bossing HIM to push HER duties on the site manager,  HER BOSS mind you. And from what I'm also told is that situationship at home is the same thing she did at the previous company she worked for before quitting and now she has a kid and a deadbeat and financial issues. 

Im just worried it'll get to the point where im also gonna get picked on cuz ive witnessed HER cover up some guards locations on the GPS tracker on our site phones. 
Least you could do is leave the site phones in the office restrooms. Than all you have to deal with is a warning. And not only that after I saw her changed the GPS I was informed that I was non compliant and letting people walk all over me when bomb squad arrived and she complained to her hiring manager.

So im gonna leave, probably better myself than this chic. They messed with the friend which is the only reason I went back to this site,  and she don't give any fucks now cuz we all could've been bros, or even a team and she just can't do the TANGO offsite.

1o8ujiv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Global-Mention-5254/comments/1o8ujiv/phoxing_village_rd_hub_a_realitybased_proposal/,"Phoxing Village R&D Hub: A Reality-Based Proposal for Integrated Rural Innovation in Khilung Deurali, Syangja","# Introduction and Background

**Phoxing** Village is located in Khilung Deurali, corresponding to Wards 6-7 of Bheerkot Municipality in Syangja District, Gandaki Province, Nepal. This mid-hill region experiences a subtropical to lower temperate climate depending on elevation and slope. Many farmers in Syangja are already cultivating citrus (especially oranges) on large scales. The district has expanded orange orchards to more than two thousand hectares under the Orange Superzone program, and in recent years Syangja has produced oranges worth over one billion Nepalese rupees. These facts show that high-value horticulture is already viable here, and that there is institutional support for horticultural expansion.

Electricity is present in many rural areas, and certain nearby places are served by internet service providers offering fiber or high-speed connectivity. There are agricultural extension services, cooperative groups, and local government bodies that have supported farmers through subsidies, training, and infrastructural programs. The Cooperative Act of Nepal (2074) provides legal infrastructure for cooperatives, and recent amendments and ordinances are strengthening cooperative regulation, including transparency, savings protection, and governance.

In Phoxing Village the terrain is hilly, slope gradients vary, soil conditions are mixed, and water availability is seasonal. Many households engage in subsistence farming, some cultivate cash crops, and traditional knowledge exists among farmers. But there is a gap between what is possible and what has been scientifically optimized; especially for new crops, post-harvest processing, digital agriculture, biodiversity, and combining tourism with agro-innovation.



# Vision

The vision is to establish a fully non-profit research, development, and enterprise hub in Phoxing Village that integrates sustainable agriculture, climate-resilient research, digital tools and remote work training, biodiversity conservation, and community-led eco-tourism, operating under a legally registered cooperative which ensures shared ownership among the local residents. The model will be replicable and documented, and will aim for financial sustainability through sale of research, information, trainings, and income from tourism and value-added agricultural products. Abroad researchers are invited to collaborate, contribute expertise, and live in the hub with free accommodation; they only cover basic living expenses (food, clothing, travel) in support of shared, non-profit goals.



# Research & Development Goals

These goals are grounded in local realities and existing institutional frameworks in Syangja. The R&D hub will focus on:

1. Establishing baseline data in Phoxing for soil composition, micro-climate, water availability, slope and sun exposure. These data will guide which crops grow best in each micro-zone.
2. Pilot trials of high-value cash crops suited to the location, likely including coffee, citrus (like oranges and lemons), avocado, and possibly indigenous fruit species. Trials will include testing different varieties, shade levels, fertilizer inputs, and organic or low-chemical methods.
3. Post-harvest processing research so that value is added locally: for example better drying, storage, packaging, quality grading so that fruit or coffee can fetch higher prices.
4. Biodiversity and ecosystem services research: mapping insect pollinators and pests, forest health, erosion and landslide risk, water catchment, and studies of agro-forestry combinations that can help both conservation and crop yield.
5. Digital agriculture tools: deploying sensors for soil moisture, temperature, humidity; developing predictive models for yields, weather patterns, disease risk; building simple software or apps to help farmers track production, quality, market demand and cooperative management.
6. Eco-tourism and homestay development that connects visitors with the research process: people can come, stay, learn about planting, processing, biodiversity, climate, digital tools. This experience gives them a reason to visit, and also helps share knowledge.
7. Cooperative governance, training, capacity building: ensuring that local people are trained in farm science, digital skills, cooperative financial management, environmental monitoring, hospitality. Ensuring the cooperative structure works legally, transparently, and benefits all members.



# Requirements & What Must Be Done

To make this proposal real and feasible, several necessary steps must be taken and resources identified:

* Formally register the cooperative under Nepal’s Cooperative Act 2074. Confirm number of members, draft bylaws, secure necessary approvals. This gives legal identity, allows fund applications, agreed profit sharing, financial transparency.
* Collect local data: soil tests (pH, organic matter, nutrient levels), rain and temperature records, water sources mapping; survey land slopes, sun exposure; inventory of existing cash crops and forest cover in Phoxing.
* Assess local connectivity: check actual internet service in Phoxing, distance to fiber nodes, mobile network coverage, reliability of power supply; plan for backup power (solar, batteries) and possible infrastructure extension if needed.
* Secure small land plot(s) for R&D trials, homestay construction, sensor station, processing space. Confirm land tenure and local community support.
* Build essential infrastructure: trial farm plots, small lab or workspace, homestay building, guest accommodation, simple processing facilities.
* Train local people: in agronomy, digital literacy, hospitality, environmental monitoring. Possibly partner with local agricultural extension services, NGOs.
* Seek small grants initially: for baseline survey work, soil testing, sensor equipment, trial inputs, construction of minimal accommodation. Use existing programs (agrarian development, climate, conservation). Leverage cooperative registration to qualify.
* Create documentation plan: record everything, publish findings (reports, articles), share best practices. This builds credibility for larger funding and replication.



# Reality Constraints & Risk Mitigation

Because Phoxing is a remote mid-hill village, the following challenges must be acknowledged and planned for:

* Dry season water scarcity: must plan for irrigation or water storage.
* Difficult access during monsoon: roads may become muddy, slippery; transportation of inputs and products may be disrupted. Need to choose sites accessible year-round, build storage to buffer.
* Limited budgets: must prioritize low-cost, high-impact interventions first: soil.tests, varieties that have higher chance of success, minimal infrastructure to start.
* Market linkage: even if you produce high quality crop, getting it to market, storing, packaging, transport can eat margins. Need to research markets and possibly form partnerships with buyers.
* Community buy-in: local acceptance matters. Trainings, shared ownership, fairness in benefit sharing must be built in to avoid conflicts.
* Regulatory compliance: cooperatives, land use, forest / biodiversity regulations must be followed. Local government must be involved.



# Call for Abroad Collaboration

We are seeking collaborators from around the world who can offer expertise, support, or partnership. You may be a researcher, student, grant writer, environmental scientist, agronomist, software or AI engineer, eco-tourism expert.

What we offer to you: free stay in Phoxing Village, access to land, workspace, internet (as available), support from local community, opportunity to live and work in rural Nepal, contribute to non-profit research with real impact. Your expenses for food, clothing, and travel will be your responsibility.

What we hope you can bring: scientific or technical expertise, help with data collection and analysis, helping write research reports or grant proposals, help design or build small tools (sensors, apps), assistance in organizing community-training or workshops, working with post-harvest processing, help with eco-tourism design.



# Conclusion

Phoxing Village, Khilung Deurali, has the climate, local farming base, and institutional environment to become a model R&D hub for sustainable rural development. With realistic baseline data, carefully selected crops, capacity building, digital tools, conservation research, and community ownership under a cooperative, it is possible to build a fully non-profit hub that benefits locals, produces publishable research, attracts collaboration, and generates sustainable livelihoods.

Abroad experts and organizations are invited to join this journey. Even modest contributions of knowledge, time, or small funding can accelerate reality.

The milk issue was really bothering me and I even considered getting a cheap espresso machine with a steam wand - but those would need to be descaled and that was exactly what I was trying to avoid with the Robot. But I think I have perfected this workflow with a couple weeks of practice.

I am using the Nanofoamer Lithium and played around with different options to warm milk… the best solution was to get a separate milk frother with a PADDLE (not spring) to heat milk to 150. Since it’s a milk frother, it won’t overheat and I can turn it to on to heat up right before I dose the beans. Then it’s ready after the shot is pulled. I found a couple options on Amazon with the paddle (the one I have was $22), and it only adds minimal foam to the milk. I tried a couple times without the paddle but the milk would burn if it didn’t move.

Once that’s transferred into an actual milk pitcher, I use the Nanofoamer but plunge it deep into the milk at the slow speed without introducing more air as Nanofoamer suggests. Their suggestion of 3-5 seconds added way too much air for me. Once the milk is being textured (you can pull in a little air if needed like literally 1 second), it’s important to find the vortex as quickly as possible without introducing more air. The vortex helps break up any large bubbles and creates the microfoam in 20-40 seconds. It seems the more surface area you can create with the milk without introducing bubbles is the secret to perfect texture.

The size of pitcher is super important! I tried everything from 300-900 ml. It literally has to be 2x the milk you are using or else it will not work consistently. Too big of a pitcher and you will get massive bubbles. Too small and it’s very easy for milk to spill out during the vortex. For latte art beginners, a round spout makes things much easier! There are tons of pointed spout options to pour designs and have more control, but that was really counterproductive for me. Round spout and as big as possible pitcher that is roughly 2x the milk worked for me. I also find more milk is easier to texture than less.

FWIW I found a cheap $14 scale with auto timer on Temu that works well, and got a coffee distributor there as well for $2. It’s made things a lot more consistent.

Hope this helps anyone who is trying to figure it out!",5,1760684806.0,CafelatRobot,1,1.0,False

It’s glow-up season, and I’m here to share my W! 🙌 After grinding it out for 2 years as a support engineer, I finally landed my dream SDE role – a huge step up! Decided to pack my bags and move to a new city for that fresh start energy. New apartment, new routines, and that unreal feeling of leveling up professionally. Honestly, it feels damn good to be here right now! 

On the personal front, it’s been a wild ride. My first (and only) breakup back in college hit like a truck, so I took a 2-3 year dating hiatus to focus on myself – skilling up, grinding through life, and just figuring things out. I’m still that introverted dude who overthinks talking to new people IRL, but I’m ready to change that. 

Hoping to meet some solid folks in this new city for coffee runs, tech meetups, or just low-key weekend plans.
October-November has been my ultimate character development arc. Been showing up for therapy, hitting the gym like a champ, and finally jumping back into dating. Signed up for Bumble, crafted some fire bios (thanks, Reddit, for the tips!), and yo – 70+ matches already! 🐝

One day, Joan and her husband went to the campus coffee shop to meet Bess and her boyfriend. The coffee shop was maybe 20'x20',  with a wide open floor plan. Unless you went into the bathroom, there was nowhere you could sit where you wouldn't have been seen by everyone else in the building.

Joan sat at their usual table, made small talk with a couple of mutual friends, waited for 20 or so minutes, and finally texted Bess to find out where they were. 

Bess replied ""I just left the coffee shop. We waited for 20 minutes and I didn't see you there."" 

From Bess' perspective, she and her boyfriend went into the same coffee shop at the same time Joan was there, went to the same familiar table, and had small talk with the same mutual friends.

1o8ugow,https://i.redd.it/2gsn2cj0fmvf1.jpeg,Evercade Update: High Scores and Roguecraft DX Suspend Save,"The October 2025 firmware update is now live for Evercade EXP/EXP-R, VS/VS-R, and Alpha. It adds two headline features along with the new “Highlight of the Month,” Boulder Dash from TheC64 Collection 3.

1. Reset High Scores
You can now manually reset saved high scores in supported arcade titles. Select the “…” on a game’s info page and choose Reset High Scores to wipe your scores back to their default settings. This is useful if you want to start fresh or fix corrupted data. A few games with unreliable score saving have had the feature turned off for now. Blaze also notes that using save states alongside high scores can sometimes cause issues, and a fix is planned for a future update.

2. Roguecraft DX Suspend Save
The standout feature is a new suspend save system for Roguecraft DX, the Amiga-inspired “coffee break” roguelike. Players can now pause mid-run, quit to the Evercade menu, and resume later without breaking the game’s permadeath design. The suspended save deletes itself once you resume or start a new game, so it remains true to the roguelike spirit. It is a smart quality-of-life feature that makes the game more accessible without removing the challenge.

The developers, Badger Punch Games, actually discussed this topic on the Retro Titans podcast, explaining why save states were originally left out to protect the roguelike experience. It looks like they listened to the community and found a compromise that works for everyone.

(Note: These features are not available on the Super Pocket or original Evercade handheld.)

1o8udyx,https://www.reddit.com/r/assam/comments/1o8udyx/a_little_incident_that_happened_long_ago/,A little incident that happened long ago,"This is an incident that happened about a decade ago. My friend, whose house is right next to the main road in a busy part of Guwahati, has the habit of standing in his balcony with a cup of coffee and casually watching people and vehicles pass by in the late evenings. On the footpath in front of his house, a few vendors gather every evening to sell vegetables, eggs and such other things.

One such late evening, my friend was standing in the usual spot in his balcony, when he noticed that all of the vendors had left after selling their stuff, except one - an old man with a small heap of garlic spread out on a sheet of plastic by the side of the footpath. There were no street lights at the time and all he had for light was a small candle that he had placed in front of him. Time passed, yet the old man didn’t seem to have a single customer come by. The candle had almost completely burned out and it’s understandable that the poor man was distraught.

The old man had given up and was on his feet arranging to pack up his garlic, when a car stopped right by him. A man got down and the following is the conversation that happened between them:

Car guy: “ki o kokai, nohoru khini bikibo nuwarila?”

Old man: “Mom dalei numai thakil. Etiya andharot bohi thaki ki nu korim.”

Car guy: “Kiman ase nohoru?”

Old man: “8-10 kilo man hobo neki.”

The car guy went back to his car, opened the boot and came back.

Car guy: “Tumi tirpal khon tumar pine dhora, moi eipine dhorisu. Eikhini ni garir dikkit dhali dim.”

The old man did as he was told and the car guy paid him. My friend couldn’t see how much he was paid, but it was a significant number of notes and the old man seemed extremely happy. The car guy was about to get into his vehicle, when the old man asked him, “pise bupai, imar hupa nohoru loisa je ki koriba?”

The car guy replied, “olop man ghorot rakhim, baki khini kaliloi goi logor keitamanok di ahim. Tatateu bhabi thakok je Zubeen e amak nohoru khini kio nu dile.”

We’re all aware of Zubeen da’s big acts of kindness. Not many of us can afford to be that selfless or generous. But these “small” acts of kindness? These are definitely within our means to imitate. This is just one incident that my friend witnessed one single evening. Zubeen da may have been doing this every day without anyone knowing about it.

1o8u3fy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o8u3fy/brutal_fearful_avoidant_discard_help/,Brutal fearful avoidant discard (help),"
I want to preface this by saying that my girlfriend was incredible, patient, loving and just utterly wonderful for the duration of our relationship.
I am a 31 year old male and she is 23.

I run and own a cafe beneath a dance studio she would regularly study dance at which is how we met. When she made her interest known, I politely declined because the age gap freaked me out, she was incredibly persistent. I did genuinely enjoy talking to her— she was very articulate, emotionally mature and we had very similar values and interests. I declined her twice.
She still came to the cafe and after much deliberation and talking with friends— they told me to not worry about the age gap and that it wouldn’t matter in the future. Aside from the age difference— she ticked a lot of boxes.

So I eventually asked her on a date and we immediately started dating. She was incredibly anxiously attached the whole relationship— and very thoughtful and communicative. I was put on the back foot a little bit as she was very quick to accelerate the relationship. Inviting me to family Christmas after 3 weeks of dating.

She lived out in the country still with her parents and would come and stay with me in the city several nights a week as that’s where she would dance and we could spend a lot of time together.

She then moved to the city and got a job. So she was studying dance from 9-2 and work at a gym 4-9 5 days a week.
This made our schedules conflict a little as I owning/ operating a cafe was up at 5am 6 days a week. But my one day off was always allocated to her. She was still my priority.

There was a time there I really hit burnout, and she was still wonderful and understanding throughout that. Constantly leaving notes and cards on my pillow saying how much she adored me and was grateful for me and thanking me for showing her what real love was (her ex was physically abusive, cheated on her and cut her off from family) 

After 3 months of her living in the city, she wrote me a text one night saying that she wasn’t too happy with how we were travelling, that she needed more quality time with a partner and as much as she expressed that, nothing has changed. (She never expressed it like that) the closest was sweet pillow talk of her saying (one night together a week isn’t enough) she then said I love you with my whole heart but it’s taking it’s toll on me.
She would often come over after she finish d work, let herself into her apartment when I was already asleep and slide into bed next to me, that’s how much she craved closeness. I would often already be asleep due to early starts. (It was very sweet) 
She also made such an effort with my family and arranged the most thoughtful birthday surprise for me.

So, she comes over later that night, climbs into bed looking sad and just hugs me. I said “hey let’s talk” she started saying things like “maybe we’re just on different paths”, “maybe it’s like right person wrong time” 
I said “it kind of sounds like you want to break up?” She then started bawling her eyes out looking at me saying “am I making the right decision, is this the right decision?” I was rather stoic in the moment and said “that’s not for me to say” so we said our I love you’s and she left.

The next day I felt off, I didn’t really want it to end. She then messaged my employee saying “hey, are you at work? Is Stav okay?” 

So I then reached out to her saying something along the lines of “ I’m willing to make compromises and sacrifices for us to move forward together, but if you really feel like this is something you need to do, I will respect it”

She then messaged back saying “ I love you so terribly much, but I’m terrified that things won’t change in the relationship.”
What she was really referring to later in the message was that I wouldn’t see a psychologist when I was burnt out from work… she was worried that I wasn’t “helping myself”. Now, I am not adverse to psychology whatsoever— my bookshelf is full of all the most obscure psychoanalysts from the 1940’s and have been to psychologists in the past for an ex who cheated on me and more existential things.

What I was doing was trying to employ someone for the last several months so I could take an extra day off, going to the doctors 7 times in the last 3 months as my hormones had crashed due to the sheer exhaustion from burnout. Working hard to be able to support her and have some financial freedom.

She also closed it her notes by saying she was bisexual and was terrified how I would perceive her, and she’s terrified she’s never explored that side of herself. 

I responded saying “hey, now you’ve articulated this, I think it would be constructive to talk about, do you mind if I come and see you?”
She agreed, so I went over immediately— she had been house sitting for a mutual friend, she opened the door and hugged and kissed me for several minutes. (She had been crying in bed all day) 
We sat down and communicated through everything (we had literally never had an argument our entire relationship).

We made a plan to move forward and how we just need to communicate better. I then stayed with her the next four days. Cooking breakfast for her, trying to make her feel safe.. just letting her know that “I’m here, it’s okay” 
She even said things like “thanks for fighting for me” and “are you sure I’m enough for you”

After this rekindling weekend, she came into the cafe saying “this isn’t working for me”
I felt completely blindsided and shocked.

She then started saying things like “the weekend didn’t feel how it was supposed to feel, like why weren’t you doing this the whole time?” Which is ridiculous, it’s not like I hadn’t cooked for her before. I constantly tried to make her feel supported through acts of service. She also said things like “my demons are coming back and it’s not fair you should put up with them” I said 
“Because I love you, I will stand by you and welcome your demons as my own” 
She assured me that she does love me, but love is more complicated than that- that it shouldn’t be “hard”. That she needed to try “something else— not someone else”
I asked why she was so sure? She said “I’m not, it’s just a feeling” she then brought up the fact I didn’t see a psychologist saying “why wouldn’t you get help? Why wouldn’t you help yourself? She was bawling her eyes out, kissing me with her head in my chest at this point. I was so shocked and I said “this is really important to me, you are really important to me and I will fight for this” I then proposed couples therapy, I said I will organise it and pay for it (I paid for everything) she then asked “can you give me a few days” she acknowledged how hard it would be for me but I said yes.

The next day a customer from the gym said she was crying at reception at work obviously very conflicted.
So a few days pass, I thought I would leave a coffee at reception at her work for her. So I walked over before her shift started and she happened to be early, pulling in. I was like “uhh, this was meant to be a lot smoother, but here you go” 
She thanked me and said “we’ll chat later? Because it will probably be a conversation longer than 5 minutes” so I went back to the cafe and messaged her at days end saying “hey that was by no means me pressuring you to chat, I just thought you could do with a coffee” 
She then expressed gratitude and that she couldn’t catch up that afternoon, but perhaps we could wait until after the weekend (it was Saturday) she also acknowledged how hard this must be for me and apologised for putting me through it.

I said that’s it’s okay, I then said that I would leave her with some notes following our last conversation. 
It was basically a list of what I thought were unfair presumptions on her behalf— points she was right— points I was wrong. How I was struggling with the quick flip after such a constructive reconciliation.

She then responded saying “after asking for space, you have over stepped that boundary, I’ve told you what I’m feeling and why and you have chosen not to listen- this is done, please respect my boundary” 

I waited a few days and said “hey, I really want to respect your boundary, if what was last said were your parting words, I’ll make my peace with that, if you’re still open to a conversation I’d appreciate it or if you just need more time, that’s okay too.

She then responded disregarding my message all together asking me to lug a bunch of big bags with dance costumes in them which had been in my apartment for 6 months into an uber as the dance company the belonged to needed them. I just did it without calling her out on anything. I felt so disrespected, so a couple of days later I returned her belongings to her housemate along with a letter.

The first third of the letter was holding her accountable for that action, but the rest was really heartfelt and thanking her for our time together. It was gut wrenching actually.

I heard nothing, she didn’t bother to return my things, then we found her profile on dating apps immediately. She was telling mutual friends that “I didn’t respect her boundary, and I left a 7 page letter she didn’t even finish reading” knowing it would get back to me.. as she was saying this directly to my mate that she works with. 
Some mutual friends she dances with came to the cafe, I showed them everything, let them read the letter and all. They were shocked at the level of emotional abuse and how she was contorting the narrative. Telling people that she “tried to end thing amicably” by ghosting me and getting me to run an errand?

Her instagram was wild, mutual friends were sending me the reels she was liking— hyper sexual content, “5 signs you’re dating a narcissist” type of stuff. Immediately started going out every night with people she doesn’t even like and palpably just spinning out online. A lot of bisexual coded stuff too.

This to everyone, and people that have known her for years is the complete opposite of what they’ve known her to be.

These two dancer friends wanted to get a coffee with her to suss out what is going on in her mind. On that very day we actually happened to cross paths, I was on the phone but she went out of her way to make eye contact with a sad/ longing sort of half smile.

She expressed to these two mutual friends- still quite arrogantly that she just wanted “more” from a relationship. But admitted that she handled things horribly and is in therapy. She then said that seeing me that day was kind of nice as she feels like she could reach out and apologise.

I reached out a few days later with a kind message just saying I’d appreciate a conversation grounded in respect and understanding. She responded with warmth saying “I’ve been meaning to reach out, I too think it would be good to have a chat” she then gave me a day and time. 
When that time came she bailed at the last minute. Saying that she’s been in fight or flight since the breakup and thought she’d be fine, but she wouldn’t be communicating so well in such a state.” 
I was nice and said that I understood and to take her time. I also mentioned that I had sorted out her script for anti anxiety cbd gummies. I ordered them for her before the breakup and they arrived just after we broke up. I still paid for them as a last gesture of good will.

I then reached out a few days later saying that I couldn’t hinge my closure or clarity on a conversation that may never come and I need to move forward for my own peace, and if she had space for it and if it was okay with her-if I could send a short voice message with my thoughts and that she wasn’t obliged to reply.

She replied with full hostility saying “ what more could you possibly say after paragraphs of texts (there was one text) 6 weeks prior which caused her to ghost me. I left her with the letter and was silent ever since.

She then said I had overstepped her needs for space again and again, that she got a text from the pharmacy after I paid for her script after the breakup and it felt like I was trying to buy her guilt or buy leverage.

She said “the way you have been acting since the breakup is deeply concerning, I encourage you to seek professional help so as to stop impeding on my sense of safety” 

I could not believe it… so I thought, well This will be the last time I get to say my piece so I just let her know that I felt discarded and ghosted, how it hurt to know how she was speaking about me post breakup with other people, diminishing and belittling me. That I was so worried about her because I felt I had triggered something from her past abusive relationship. Then I called her out gently saying that her behaviour has been emotionally abusive and for someone to champion psychology to not even be able to extend compassion, empathy, admission of mistreatment or any of these fundamental things is hypocrisy of the highest degree.

She then responded saying “please leave me alone, if you contact me again I will seek legal action, and please continue getting professional help”

This was on fb messenger and shockingly she did not block me, 5 minutes later she angry reacted to my first message… almost baiting me.

It has been very hard to wrap my head around how someone who was showering me in love and gratitude saying how much “healing was happening in this relationship for her” so, so anxiously attached. And so consistent throughout the relationship has flipped so violently.
I went to a psychologist immediately, I lost 8kg in 10 days and was surviving on Valium. 

It was like she was going out of her way to hurt me for no reason, telling my friend about a threesome offer from colleagues, talking openly about dating apps in front of him knowing it would get back to me. Getting me to run an errand whilst I was left in the dark.
I can’t fathom the cruelty. I was not bombarding her with messages or calls. I left her with a letter… that was it

She was honestly so wonderful throughout the relationship, there was no sign of any toxicity or avoidant tendencies.

It’s ironic that she implores me to get professional help as so many people have come forward ( her friends) concerned about how unhinged she is appearing on social media and how it’s the complete opposite of everything they’ve known her to be.
She was an extremely wholesome girl. Only two weeks before this I had surprised at work with cake and flowers and she was utterly beaming. She would constantly go out of her way to shower me in love, gratitude and affection.

I want to preface this by saying that my girlfriend was incredible, patient, loving and just utterly wonderful for the duration of our relationship.
I am a 31 year old male and she is 23.

I run and own a cafe beneath a dance studio she would regularly study dance at which is how we met. When she made her interest known, I politely declined because the age gap freaked me out, she was incredibly persistent. I did genuinely enjoy talking to her— she was very articulate, emotionally mature and we had very similar values and interests. I declined her twice.
She still came to the cafe and after much deliberation and talking with friends— they told me to not worry about the age gap and that it wouldn’t matter in the future. Aside from the age difference— she ticked a lot of boxes.

So I eventually asked her on a date and we immediately started dating. She was incredibly anxiously attached the whole relationship— and very thoughtful and communicative. I was put on the back foot a little bit as she was very quick to accelerate the relationship. Inviting me to family Christmas after 3 weeks of dating.

She lived out in the country still with her parents and would come and stay with me in the city several nights a week as that’s where she would dance and we could spend a lot of time together.

She then moved to the city and got a job. So she was studying dance from 9-2 and work at a gym 4-9 5 days a week.
This made our schedules conflict a little as I owning/ operating a cafe was up at 5am 6 days a week. But my one day off was always allocated to her. She was still my priority.

There was a time there I really hit burnout, and she was still wonderful and understanding throughout that. Constantly leaving notes and cards on my pillow saying how much she adored me and was grateful for me and thanking me for showing her what real love was (her ex was physically abusive, cheated on her and cut her off from family) 

After 3 months of her living in the city, she wrote me a text one night saying that she wasn’t too happy with how we were travelling, that she needed more quality time with a partner and as much as she expressed that, nothing has changed. (She never expressed it like that) the closest was sweet pillow talk of her saying (one night together a week isn’t enough) she then said I love you with my whole heart but it’s taking it’s toll on me.
She would often come over after she finish d work, let herself into her apartment when I was already asleep and slide into bed next to me, that’s how much she craved closeness. I would often already be asleep due to early starts. (It was very sweet) 
She also made such an effort with my family and arranged the most thoughtful birthday surprise for me.

So, she comes over later that night, climbs into bed looking sad and just hugs me. I said “hey let’s talk” she started saying things like “maybe we’re just on different paths”, “maybe it’s like right person wrong time” 
I said “it kind of sounds like you want to break up?” She then started bawling her eyes out looking at me saying “am I making the right decision, is this the right decision?” I was rather stoic in the moment and said “that’s not for me to say” so we said our I love you’s and she left.

...And then I remembered being 22, 23, 24, on and on. I realized I'd been wanting human connection then too. I remembered that I always felt pretty lonely, even in a room full of people. People I actually knew and who knew me, too. 

I had convinced myself the last couple years that this loneliness was a new thing. That over the past decade, I had lost nearly every meaningful connection I had with someone in some way. Honestly, some days that thought stream really beat me over the head. I started to almost convince myself that I was just a wildly unlikeable thing. 

I came here not with much intent to speak to anyone but to voyeur at the loneliness of others. Pretty shitty, I know. My intentions weren't malicious. I was looking for kindred spirits from the wallpapered corner of the party, so to speak. 

I've had a change of heart. Reading all your posts, it helped me dig around the bins of my brain. I was able to objectively look at the social sector of my life. (I'm not sure how it happened really - both Freud and Jung would have answers, I'm not sure if like either.) What I realized is very simple.

**I am not the wildly unlikeable thing, and neither are any of you.** 

Thank you for that. Everyone who posted anything here. 

Some of my favorite things are: 
Reading (with special interest in Poetry and...well, philosophy I suppose. You ever thought about how an Anarchist society would protect itself from major threats? Have you ever read a haiku in translation so touching you literally cried?)

The vast and endless genre of RPG games 
Classic tabletop games (Yahtzee anyone?) 

Coffee. That is all. 

Animals of all kind (including a penchant for bugs and snakes)

Documentaries (particularly True Crime and loooonnnnggggg historical works)

Horror Films! 

Painting (I've recently started learning my way with watercolor)

Health and Wellness (I've been doing this semi Carnivore thing, it's an interesting journey. Wanna talk about it?)

Wandering the world with my partner and feline fur child


It's really hard to write about yourself in this way and I did my best. I will warn you I am supportive and loving, but direct in ways that can sometimes be off putting. I am not constantly glued to my phone, but I will always text or call you back. I've heard I'm pretty funny. 

 I see you, you know. Whoever read this far. Not in the literal weird fucking way but in the way that something in me recognizes something in you. It's nice, I swear.

Wanna talk and hang out for a bit?

She also made such an effort with my family and arranged the most thoughtful birthday surprise for me.

So, she comes over later that night, climbs into bed looking sad and just hugs me. I said “hey let’s talk” she started saying things like “maybe we’re just on different paths”, “maybe it’s like right person wrong time” 
I said “it kind of sounds like you want to break up?” She then started bawling her eyes out looking at me saying “am I making the right decision, is this the right decision?” I was rather stoic in the moment and said “that’s not for me to say” so we said our I love you’s and she left.

The next day I felt off, I didn’t really want it to end. She then messaged my employee saying “hey, are you at work? Is Stav okay?” 

So I then reached out to her saying something along the lines of “ I’m willing to make compromises and sacrifices for us to move forward together, but if you really feel like this is something you need to do, I will respect it”

She then messaged back saying “ I love you so terribly much, but I’m terrified that things won’t change in the relationship.”
What she was really referring to later in the message was that I wouldn’t see a psychologist when I was burnt out from work… she was worried that I wasn’t “helping myself”. Now, I am not adverse to psychology whatsoever— my bookshelf is full of all the most obscure psychoanalysts from the 1940’s and have been to psychologists in the past for an ex who cheated on me and more existential things.

What I was doing was trying to employ someone for the last several months so I could take an extra day off, going to the doctors 7 times in the last 3 months as my hormones had crashed due to the sheer exhaustion from burnout. Working hard to be able to support her and have some financial freedom.

She also closed it her notes by saying she was bisexual and was terrified how I would perceive her, and she’s terrified she’s never explored that side of herself. 

I responded saying “hey, now you’ve articulated this, I think it would be constructive to talk about, do you mind if I come and see you?”
She agreed, so I went over immediately— she had been house sitting for a mutual friend, she opened the door and hugged and kissed me for several minutes. (She had been crying in bed all day) 
We sat down and communicated through everything (we had literally never had an argument our entire relationship).

We made a plan to move forward and how we just need to communicate better. I then stayed with her the next four days. Cooking breakfast for her, trying to make her feel safe.. just letting her know that “I’m here, it’s okay” 
She even said things like “thanks for fighting for me” and “are you sure I’m enough for you”

After this rekindling weekend, she came into the cafe saying “this isn’t working for me”
I felt completely blindsided and shocked.

She then started saying things like “the weekend didn’t feel how it was supposed to feel, like why weren’t you doing this the whole time?” Which is ridiculous, it’s not like I hadn’t cooked for her before. I constantly tried to make her feel supported through acts of service. She also said things like “my demons are coming back and it’s not fair you should put up with them” I said 
“Because I love you, I will stand by you and welcome your demons as my own” 
She assured me that she does love me, but love is more complicated than that- that it shouldn’t be “hard”. That she needed to try “something else— not someone else”
I asked why she was so sure? She said “I’m not, it’s just a feeling” she then brought up the fact I didn’t see a psychologist saying “why wouldn’t you get help? Why wouldn’t you help yourself? She was bawling her eyes out, kissing me with her head in my chest at this point. I was so shocked and I said “this is really important to me, you are really important to me and I will fight for this” I then proposed couples therapy, I said I will organise it and pay for it (I paid for everything) she then asked “can you give me a few days” she acknowledged how hard it would be for me but I said yes.

The next day a customer from the gym said she was crying at reception at work obviously very conflicted.
So a few days pass, I thought I would leave a coffee at reception at her work for her. So I walked over before her shift started and she happened to be early, pulling in. I was like “uhh, this was meant to be a lot smoother, but here you go” 
She thanked me and said “we’ll chat later? Because it will probably be a conversation longer than 5 minutes” so I went back to the cafe and messaged her at days end saying “hey that was by no means me pressuring you to chat, I just thought you could do with a coffee” 
She then expressed gratitude and that she couldn’t catch up that afternoon, but perhaps we could wait until after the weekend (it was Saturday) she also acknowledged how hard this must be for me and apologised for putting me through it.

I said that’s it’s okay, I then said that I would leave her with some notes following our last conversation. 
It was basically a list of what I thought were unfair presumptions on her behalf— points she was right— points I was wrong. How I was struggling with the quick flip after such a constructive reconciliation.

She then responded saying “after asking for space, you have over stepped that boundary, I’ve told you what I’m feeling and why and you have chosen not to listen- this is done, please respect my boundary” 

I waited a few days and said “hey, I really want to respect your boundary, if what was last said were your parting words, I’ll make my peace with that, if you’re still open to a conversation I’d appreciate it or if you just need more time, that’s okay too.

She then responded disregarding my message all together asking me to lug a bunch of big bags with dance costumes in them which had been in my apartment for 6 months into an uber as the dance company the belonged to needed them. I just did it without calling her out on anything. I felt so disrespected, so a couple of days later I returned her belongings to her housemate along with a letter.

The first third of the letter was holding her accountable for that action, but the rest was really heartfelt and thanking her for our time together. It was gut wrenching actually.

I heard nothing, she didn’t bother to return my things, then we found her profile on dating apps immediately. She was telling mutual friends that “I didn’t respect her boundary, and I left a 7 page letter she didn’t even finish reading” knowing it would get back to me.. as she was saying this directly to my mate that she works with. 
Some mutual friends she dances with came to the cafe, I showed them everything, let them read the letter and all. They were shocked at the level of emotional abuse and how she was contorting the narrative. Telling people that she “tried to end thing amicably” by ghosting me and getting me to run an errand?

Her instagram was wild, mutual friends were sending me the reels she was liking— hyper sexual content, “5 signs you’re dating a narcissist” type of stuff. Immediately started going out every night with people she doesn’t even like and palpably just spinning out online. A lot of bisexual coded stuff too.

This to everyone, and people that have known her for years is the complete opposite of what they’ve known her to be.

These two dancer friends wanted to get a coffee with her to suss out what is going on in her mind. On that very day we actually happened to cross paths, I was on the phone but she went out of her way to make eye contact with a sad/ longing sort of half smile.

She expressed to these two mutual friends- still quite arrogantly that she just wanted “more” from a relationship. But admitted that she handled things horribly and is in therapy. She then said that seeing me that day was kind of nice as she feels like she could reach out and apologise.

I reached out a few days later with a kind message just saying I’d appreciate a conversation grounded in respect and understanding. She responded with warmth saying “I’ve been meaning to reach out, I too think it would be good to have a chat” she then gave me a day and time. 
When that time came she bailed at the last minute. Saying that she’s been in fight or flight since the breakup and thought she’d be fine, but she wouldn’t be communicating so well in such a state.” 
I was nice and said that I understood and to take her time. I also mentioned that I had sorted out her script for anti anxiety cbd gummies. I ordered them for her before the breakup and they arrived just after we broke up. I still paid for them as a last gesture of good will.

I then reached out a few days later saying that I couldn’t hinge my closure or clarity on a conversation that may never come and I need to move forward for my own peace, and if she had space for it and if it was okay with her-if I could send a short voice message with my thoughts and that she wasn’t obliged to reply.

She replied with full hostility saying “ what more could you possibly say after paragraphs of texts (there was one text) 6 weeks prior which caused her to ghost me. I left her with the letter and was silent ever since.

She then said I had overstepped her needs for space again and again, that she got a text from the pharmacy after I paid for her script after the breakup and it felt like I was trying to buy her guilt or buy leverage.

She said “the way you have been acting since the breakup is deeply concerning, I encourage you to seek professional help so as to stop impeding on my sense of safety” 

I could not believe it… so I thought, well This will be the last time I get to say my piece so I just let her know that I felt discarded and ghosted, how it hurt to know how she was speaking about me post breakup with other people, diminishing and belittling me. That I was so worried about her because I felt I had triggered something from her past abusive relationship. Then I called her out gently saying that her behaviour has been emotionally abusive and for someone to champion psychology to not even be able to extend compassion, empathy, admission of mistreatment or any of these fundamental things is hypocrisy of the highest degree.

She then responded saying “please leave me alone, if you contact me again I will seek legal action, and please continue getting professional help”

This was on fb messenger and shockingly she did not block me, 5 minutes later she angry reacted to my first message… almost baiting me.

It has been very hard to wrap my head around how someone who was showering me in love and gratitude saying how much “healing was happening in this relationship for her” so, so anxiously attached. And so consistent throughout the relationship has flipped so violently.
I went to a psychologist immediately, I lost 8kg in 10 days and was surviving on Valium. 

It was like she was going out of her way to hurt me for no reason, telling my friend about a threesome offer from colleagues, talking openly about dating apps in front of him knowing it would get back to me. Getting me to run an errand whilst I was left in the dark.
I can’t fathom the cruelty. I was not bombarding her with messages or calls. I left her with a letter… that was it

She was honestly so wonderful throughout the relationship, there was no sign of any toxicity or avoidant tendencies.

It’s ironic that she implores me to get professional help as so many people have come forward ( her friends) concerned about how unhinged she is appearing on social media and how it’s the complete opposite of everything they’ve known her to be.
She was an extremely wholesome girl. Only two weeks before this I had surprised at work with cake and flowers and she was utterly beaming. She would constantly go out of her way to shower me in love, gratitude and affection.

Then a few days ago, HR somehow found my profile. My manager emails me: “Please schedule a meeting regarding recent online activity.”

We get on a call, and he pulls up a bunch of screenshots of me streaming. Says I violated company policy by “broadcasting internal workflows and confidential materials.”

I tried explaining that nothing from work was visible, only my face, but they called it a “potential security risk.”

I’m solo and pretty social, so if there are any casual meetups, events, or if anyone wants to grab a drink or wander around, I’m down. Feel free to drop suggestions or DM.

Some things I love doing.

Im big into reading so I have a few bookstores on my list
Seeing local art
Occult and oddities stores will often hurt me financially 
Goth stuff???? Is there a goth scene in SF i would love to know
Talking to weird people like myself
I also plan on spending a day exploring castro street so thats in the itinerary. 

What should I add?????

Thanks in advance!

I should also note im bringing my car as I only live a few hours away so any good car garage places that have a nice daily rate and security would be appreciated.

I’ve tried instant coffee (convenient, but soulless), drip machines (too watery) and even a few espresso makers (good, but something still feels missing).

A coffee machine that doesn’t just make coffee, but gives that cafe-level experience specially the smell.

Something that lets me feel the process... the grind, the aroma, the steam... not just press a button.

Ideally, something that balances convenience with ritual of making coffee.

I went to sit down at some tables and she sits across a few tables down..I've noticed she's making a lot of eye contact. 

I don't even finish my coffee. I get my helmet and get on my motorcycle to leave. As I'm driving. I see her standing in the middle of the parking lot and I see her and just moved on. I'm sure she wanted to look at her. 

The thing is, she wanted me to not control her. I gave her that. She would barely talk to e after things were getting sour. Why all of a sudden this after she seemed disinterested. 

If there are ladies here. Tell me our thoughts. What you perceive. ",0,1760682156.0,adultery,1,0.5,False
