1kyttz6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kyttz6,Please help me choose a wall color!,"I’m planning to repaint the blue/gray walls but want to keep the existing white trim and wainscoting. I’m torn between two options that I’ve come down to:

Option 1: Match the trim color and use it on the walls in a flat finish. My concern is that it might feel a bit too sterile - but since the room doesn’t get much natural light, that might actually work in its favor.

Option 2: Go with something warmer, which is what my designer suggested. But so far, I haven’t been happy with the results. I’ve tested Swiss Coffee, Simply White, and White Dove, and they all read too yellow - or even greenish in certain lighting. White Dove in particular looked muddy and picked up reddish tones in low light, especially next to the white trim and wainscoting.

If I’m keeping the current trim and ceiling color, would it make the most sense to just use that same color on the walls in a flat finish? Any other suggestions are more than welcome!",2,1748574252.0,interiordecorating,0,1.0,False
1kyttn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BangaloreSocial/comments/1kyttn0/where_are_the_chill_hangout_folks_in_bangalore/,Where are the chill hangout folks in Bangalore these days?,"Hey everyone,

24M here. Born and raised in Bangalore, but somehow finding it surprisingly tough to build those day-to-day friendships — the kind where you spontaneously text someone and say “Gym today?” or “Let’s hit a board game café this Sunday” or just chill with a chai and talk about life.

Some personal lore: I’ve got a decent circle of friends from school and college, but most have either moved out of Bangalore, are neck-deep in work, or have entered that “I only leave the house for groceries” era of adulthood. I’ve always been the kind of person who values those low-key, consistent, quality friendships — and I’ve realized recently that I’m really missing them.

I’m not much of a party guy, and pubs/clubs don’t really feel like my scene. I don’t drink or smoke, and I’m not super into nightlife culture — so that cuts out a large chunk of the usual “hangout” options people suggest. And while I’ve tried meetup events (board game cafes, poetry nights, hobby circles), they sometimes feel like one-off encounters — fun in the moment, but rarely translating into something lasting.

What I’m looking for:

A gym buddy (someone who can push and be pushed — I’m consistent, not ripped lol)

A cricket buddy — maybe some casual weekend matches or nets? I’m not gully cricket legend material but I can hold a bat and bowl without embarrassing myself too much

A board game buddy — cafes like Dialogues, Lahe Lahe, etc. are cool but it's more fun with the right crowd

Just someone who's down to hang out — could be walks, coffee, food, even just doing nothing much but chilling and vibing


I’m not super extroverted, but not a full introvert either. Somewhere in between. I can hold conversations, enjoy listening as much as talking, and I’m the kind of person who actually replies to messages.

I’ve come to accept that this stage of life — early 20s, post-college, pre-marriage, figuring-it-out phase — is one where a lot of us feel a little adrift. I know I do, sometimes. And I genuinely believe that a lot of us out here in Bangalore are quietly looking for the same thing: connection, not just interaction.

So yeah — if you’re in a similar headspace, around my age, and feel like we could vibe over shared hobbies or just the occasional gym session or board game night, drop a message or leave a comment.

Let’s try building something offline for a change. :)

Peace out,
A guy who still believes in friendship in the digital age.

1kytsls,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskChicago/comments/1kytsls/has_chicago_ever_felt_underwhelming_to_you_is_it/,Has Chicago ever felt underwhelming to you? Is it just me?,"I moved here recently. I grew up in Rockford, Illinois, but I haven't been in this state in around 7 years. Recently, I spent around a year and a half in London and a month in Tokyo.

Having moved from those places, Chicago just feels dead and empty to me. It doesn't feel like a city. I live in Avondale right now, in a more suburban area, but even when I go to a place like Logan Square or the Loop or wherever, it doesn't feel like anything is happening. It doesn't feel like there's any motion.

In London, there's always a massive crowd. I mean, it's like 10 times the amount of people here. You can always find people performing in the tube stations, on street corners, and the crowd feels alive. London is a massive multicultural center, and you can always hear like 5 different languages at once.

Or take Shibuya; the crossing has thousands of people in going in every direction. I saw a man with a horse mask playing drums, there was another man with a spandex suit and plastic bats saying ""hit me for 500 yen"", there's neon lights everywhere, people drive go-karts through the streets, etc. It feels like there's ""motion"", like the area has a life of its own. There's always a motion, and it never dies; even at 3 AM on Tuesday, people are still out.

I notice this lack even on the trains; the trains here are old, slow, and dirty. In Tokyo, the trains have TVs on them, and you can watch game shows and anime and all kinds of stuff. You see the people who into alternative fashion and wearing whatever collab is popular at the time, etc. In London too, the tube stations are bigger, you can get coffee there, there are more people playing music, there are more people on the train, etc. I remember one time, on the Jubilee Line, it got so crowded that I didn't even have space to turn my head; for about half an hour, when anyone wants to get off, about 20 people had get out to create room.

Here, on my daily blue line trip, barely anyone is on the train, and even in the CTAs ""crowded"" moments, it just doesn't feel anything like that.

I don't know if anyone has a similar feeling, but, for me, this feels more like a small town trying to be a big city than an actual big city. It's a bit disappointing; I have memories coming here when I was a kid, and I remember it feeling more like that. I guess that's how nostalgia works though.

I’m just doing a “soft” 16:8, where I’ll have a splash of lite milk in my morning coffee, and my nightcap cup of tea around 9:30.m, but strict around everything else. Some days it sort of organically becomes 18:6 depending on my schedule! I’m not intentionally calorie restricting - just listening to my body and eating within the window when I’m hungry, but that routine *has* put me in a caloric deficit.

So I’m losing weight quite effectively, and feeling good. But honestly it’s been faster than I thought. I’m down 5kg (11lbs) in 20 days! I suspect the first couple of those were water weight, but that still feels quite quick.

I’m not complaining, but I guess just wondering if I should be doing anything different, or slowing down at all?

For some, that might be enough time to heal—but for me, the grief still sits heavy. We had a very special bond (as I’m sure many of you can relate to). She wasn’t just my grandmother—she was my best friend, my role model, and in many ways, my anchor.

During her final months in hospice, I was battling a secret addiction to opioids—mainly oxycodone and Percocet. No one in my family, including her, knew. I share this not to shift focus, but because it colors the complexity of my grief and the guilt I still carry.

My grandmother had beaten breast cancer twice. The first time, I was around 8 years old, and she handled it with strength and grace. She’d lost her hair and said she loved wearing beautiful wigs and wraps. She always focused on the positive. She’d sit on the porch with coffee and remind me how beautiful life is. Those moments shaped who I am.

The cancer returned again when I was a teenager, and this time she had to undergo a mastectomy. Still, she was unbreakable to me. She had friends, a routine, a vibrant spirit. She had worked in television as a journalist and was well-known in both Cuba and Miami. Everyone loved her. She was elegant, kind, creative, and endlessly generous. I used to say I’d be lucky to become half the woman she was.

But about 15 years after her last fight, the cancer returned once more—this time in her liver, and it quickly spread. She chose to forgo chemotherapy. She knew it would only prolong the inevitable, and she wanted to be at home.

We’re a small, tight-knit family. My mom, uncle, and grandmother raised me. I’m an only child, and losing her felt like losing the foundation of my world. We all took turns caring for her—sleeping by her side, helping her to the bathroom, doing everything we could.

At first, she was still herself—joking, sipping coffee, even smoking the occasional cigarette. She told me she wasn’t afraid of death, but she was afraid of what dying would feel like. That has haunted me ever since.

Eventually, she couldn’t eat. Then she couldn’t keep water down. Her pain became unbearable. She was given morphine, which helped somewhat—but toward the end, she stopped speaking. She’d wake up crying out for her long-departed parents, confused and distressed. We did everything to comfort her, but it was heartbreaking to witness.

My uncle began researching self-euthanasia. We were devastated to learn it was illegal in Florida. Before she went non-verbal, she told us clearly: she was ready to go. But we couldn’t help her. She was trapped in her failing body, unable to voice her needs anymore, and there was nothing we could do.

I’m still so angry. Angry that we couldn’t give her the dignity of dying on her own terms. Angry that I don’t know what she was thinking or feeling in her final days. Angry that a woman who cherished life so deeply had to suffer so much in the end. She didn’t deserve that. No one does.

And I’m angry at myself—for using, for numbing, for not being fully present. At the time, I told myself I was coping, but the truth is, I hadn’t processed anything. Now, at 9 months sober, it’s all crashing down on me. The guilt. The grief. The regret.

I don’t know why I’m posting this. Maybe just to get it out. Maybe in hopes that someone else can relate. Maybe to say, publicly, that I want to advocate for the right to die with dignity. I truly believe terminally ill individuals should have the option to leave this world peacefully—on their terms, before they lose the ability to express that wish.

If you’ve experienced something similar, I’m so sorry. I hope you know you’re not alone.

Abue, I miss you more than I can put into words. I don’t believe in God or an afterlife, but I’m endlessly grateful that we coincided in this one. I love you always.",1,1748573947.0,GriefSupport,0,1.0,False
1kytq2n,https://www.reddit.com/r/PrincessCruises/comments/1kytq2n/coral_princessalaska_cruise_tour_51828/,Coral Princess-Alaska Cruise Tour 5/18-28,"First time/last time cruising with Princess! We started with the tour part of our journey in Fairbanks. The first night was fine, everything seemed fine from airport to hotel. Then the next two nights as we moved further into Alaska, seeing Denali, taking the train, things started to be a bit disorganized. They gave us hotel keys that did not work the second night. There was a hotel person there to let us in, but when I enquired as to how we needed to proceed to get our key fixed, she was kinda snotty. The third night, after a very long day, we were assigned an occupied room. So embarrassing as we bothered this man and his sick wife. When we went to guest services, no real apology and a lie were given but they did give us our actual room number this time. After an hour and half or so it was sorted. Too bad everything was now closed at the hotel, so we ate snacks and went to bed. 

Now onto the cruise. I had never cruised with Princess, but was always told how perfect they were to cruise to Alaska. I booked a cruise package that included the drink package. Here are the issues we ran into:

I quickly learned that the drink package was a pain as to what was included and you couldn’t have a can of soda, it had to be in a glass. They brought us fountain drinks all cruise that never tasted right. They also serve you in a tiny glass, but you cannot order two? Whatever. Makes them look petty and cheap. We don’t drink alcohol so I think a can of soda wouldn’t have bankrupted them. 

Then the food. Not good. Poor presentation, lots of mystery and hot orange juice and milk. Who puts milk in a container on a tray with no refrigeration and leaves it until it’s gone? Ew. The orange juice was so warm it could melt a whole glass of ice in 5 minutes. Gross. Salad bar was lacking. My husband had stomach issues after eating cold seafood and also again after eating a burger. He just stopped eating the day before the cruise ended because he was tired of all the issues. 

Their tracking app and medallion thing is a bit ridiculous. You could order drinks etc, but you may never get it. You’ll be charged though! I ordered a pizza to the state room because I didn’t want to brace the buffet and it came half cooked. I requested a refund, didn’t get it. 

Many of the staff seemed irritated, particularly at the bars around the ship. When they discovered you were on the drink plan, they stopped talking to you. 

Good things:

Room steward was absolutely on top of it. Super friendly too. 

Staff at the coffee shop was awesome. 

The excursions we took, salmon bake, wagon ride with dinner, lumberjack show and axe throwing, white pass train, glacier gardens and Mendenhall glacier were all outstanding. 

The captain did a great job showing us the glacier Bay and other sights from the ship. 

The naturalist on board was great. She did presentations and spent quite a bit of time on the mic sharing info and pointing out animals. 

Park service rangers were very informative and helpful at Glacier Bay. 

Overall, I give it a 7/10. I was ready to go home. We have sailed 6 or 7 times with Carnival and never had any of these issues. I think I’ll be going back!

1kytmzr,https://www.reddit.com/r/bipolar/comments/1kytmzr/a_series_of_fortunate_events_a_diary_entry_of_a/,"A Series of Fortunate Events, a diary entry of a Bipolar l Mom of 2 kids","For the first time since last Spring, I feel like a person again. 

A couple nights ago I had a talk with Sam, my husband, and cried my eyeballs out. He listened and offered support. We talked for a couple hours I bet. He reminded me that all I could do is focus on him and the kids. He said, “I need you. The kids need you.” “I’m not going to push you but I’m not going to stop encouraging you to get out.” 

Later that night, I decided to book a flight to join my kids on their visit to see my Mom in Arizona. “My kids need me” and I need to focus on them. In fact my mom needs me too. And going to see her will feel like a reprieve from awkward encounters with everyone around here. It was a decision that I felt proud of, instead of “passing the buck” of taking care of my kids onto someone else, I could make memories with them. Take them to the water park  they love. Wake up early and skate like last year while I was going through IOP. 

The next morning, I sent an apology text to Irene for missing Memorial Day dinner. She had invited the family over but I wasn’t feeling up to it so they went without me. Sam covered for me, said I was sick and while that’s technically true, the reality is that I’ve been sick in bed with depression since September. Sleeping endlessly. On a good day I was watching 8-12 hrs of reality TV. 

Anyway, Irene shared that there was a long time where she never left the house. I cried because I felt seen. I told her that everyone in my life knows what happened when I was manic last Summer, and I can’t shield myself from the embarrassment, guilt, and shame when I see other people so I just want to hide. She said so many encouraging and supportive things like “don’t put pressure on yourself to snap out of it. “Everyone knows. It happened 🤷‍♀️… it’s done, you can’t go back and change it.” “We all mistakes and have issues.” 

All of a sudden I had courage. I sent an apology to my neighbors the next day for my behavior in Summer. I didn’t hear back from everyone but I did hear from A, K and T. I felt heard and supported. More on that later I guess. Afterward I called my Mom and told her about my apology, while crying, and that I was coming to Arizona. She was so excited. 

Today I woke up around 9:30 and thought “I wouldn’t mind getting out of bed.” What a fucking miracle. 

Thank goodness because it’s the first day of Summer for the kids. We had agreed to try going Bowling today. So I got up, made coffee for the first time in a whiiillllllleee, drank it, showered (still skipping makeup and hair), and took them bowling.  

I was able to coach my son through feeling bad about not bowling very well. He was pouting real bad but I chatted with him and tickled him and a couple minutes later he was back to his silly self! Mom win, y’all. At dinner he said bowling was the best part of the day. 

I need to get some sleep. Oh but I was gonna say… 
Feeling good feels a lot like mania. Isn’t it scary? Yes. Yes it is. But I’m taking my meds this time, and I’m stone-cold sober and have been for two years. 

So hopefully I don’t slide back into mania. I hope I don’t sink back into depression. Bipolar is a bitch.

1kytl0j,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1kytl0j/i_signed_an_nda_to_meet_a_game_dev_team_i_regret/,I Signed an NDA to Meet a Game Dev Team. I Regret It.,"I have to be incredibly careful with what I say here. Not just because of the NDA I signed with one of the biggest names in gaming, but because what I'm about to share is one of the darkest secrets a billion-dollar company could possibly bury. And I fear the consequences might be worse than a pack of hungry lawyers clawing down my door.

Honestly, I never planned to speak on any of this. In my mind, it was always meant to stay buried. One of the skeletons we take to the grave, you know? *Maybe* it'd come out to a longtime partner or some random at a bar. But for the most part? I fully expected to keep all of this to myself.

Things have changed. Drastically.

A few months back, I was lurking on a few boards and came across a rumor that this particular gaming studio was developing a new project. By rule, I typically avoided anything related to this gaming studio, so it had been a while since I had seen any associated news. I suppose that when I did see the community buzzing, it sparked a mild curiosity.

This goes without saying, but most online rumors are entirely false, regardless of the conversation around them. However, anyone with a nerdy niche interest knows that if you're in the right circles, there's always someone who seems to know just a little bit more than everyone else. And confirmation from one of these types of people led me on a wild goose chase for more information.

While I didn't find much beyond hints at what might be in development, I came across a comment that halted my research.

The comment read: ""I'm surprised \[the gaming company\] is still around. Does anyone else recall the disturbing stunt they pulled at their offices years ago? They never addressed it and continued on like nothing happened after seriously traumatizing people. Seriously. Stop buying their games.""

It was odd at the moment. I could feel my heartbeat rapidly increasing in my chest. I kept re-reading the comment over and over because there was no way he was referring to what I thought he was referring to.

Five, ten, fifteen minutes later, I'm still looking at the comment. Trying to deny what I knew had to be true.

But why was I reacting like that? I had seen the company's name and watched playthroughs of their game? Hell, I was doing research on them myself. Why was I reacting like this?

Only now, on reflection, do I realize it's not about them. It's not even about me. Not really. It's in the understanding that the experience was a shared one. Not just my trauma but the widespread silent trauma of everyone who had been there.

We saw something collectively, and the fact that it wasn't just me or one or two other people made it so much more real. And even more so... We were all so scared that every single person had been forced into silence.

I quickly typed out a reply for the commenter to message me. Not good enough. After deleting the comment, I messaged them directly, hoping and praying for a response.

Almost immediately after I did, they replied with a simple ""F--- off"" and blocked me.

Great.

I spent the next few weeks looking to see if anyone else had said anything similar. My life was comprised of going to work, ordering takeout, and scouring the internet for someone else who had come forward. Nothing.

And in the midst of all of this. I got a call. One that sent me spiraling. It reignited images of that day so vivid I often feel as though they're burned into my psyche.

The following nightmares have woken me up in cold sweats on multiple occasions.

So here I am, telling a story roughly a decade old. I apologize if anyone was looking for a grand adventure or a philosophical lesson. This isn't that. Just a story of a terrified man who understands that telling you this may be the only way I can cope.

That's all I'm asking for at this point. I don't need a solution or even for those responsible to face justice. I just want to be able to sleep peacefully again.

So, there I was again, lurking on forums. This one, in particular, was dedicated to one of the most anticipated titles of the time from the aforementioned gaming studio. Exciting life, I know.

I rarely talked on forums. But whenever I did, I'd usually get replies from the same few accounts. Most of it was innocuous, and nothing I've committed to memory. I suppose that day was unique.

At that point, we were still far enough away from release that there wasn't a whole lot of information out yet. So I did what any delusional person would do: I asked the board if anyone knew someone with inside info. Gameplay, mechanics, plans for the story... I didn't care. I just wanted something to enhance the excitement I was already feeling in the fear that my curiosity would grow painfully unbearable.

Hours passed, and disappointingly, my question was lost in the sea of random conversation. It's not the first time, but this one stung a bit extra.

I slept, thought nothing of it, and woke up to a familiar notification the next day. It was one of the accounts that had often replied to me.

When I checked the forum, he had responded to my post with a simple ""Yes"" and a link.

Curious but excited, I cautiously clicked on it to see what they had sent me. I was greeted by this bland-looking flyer. My eyes widened as I read the headline, ""Meet & Greet with the Dev Team"" along with the company logo and the title of the upcoming game.

I nearly gasped when I finished reading the words. Here was my chance. I could meet the team behind the game and get some inside information on their plans. Hell, maybe I could even bring some of the most-asked questions from the forum back and really make an impression on people. Anything to get those meaningless internet points.

And wouldn't you know it? They were setting up shop pretty close, and tickets were relatively cheap. Back then, I assumed that dev teams only met fans at huge cons or launch parties, if they did at all. Never before a game was even released. But I wasn't complaining.

In the end, I figured it was perhaps something to stir up some hype. It's not unusual for PR teams to devise innovative ways to connect with the public. And hey, maybe the team leaked a rumor or two to one of the participants, who then spread it around, and now there's a newfound interest in your game.

It's wrong as hell now, but that's how I rationalized it in my mind.

The day of the meet-and-greet arrives, and I'm headed over. My expectation is to pull into a GameStop  or some other cleared-out lot with tons of fanfare. Maybe there would be signing booths, different stations, mascots, you know? The whole thing.

Instead, I pull into a relatively mundane set of office buildings. At first, I wasn't sure if I was very early or being pranked because there was no way an official event wouldn't have hundreds of people there. Especially given that I live near a very populous city.

Looking out my window, I finally spot a decent-sized line of people coming out of one of the buildings and several unremarkable signs lazily pointing toward where the meet-and-greet is taking place.

Side note. If you're looking to crush the spirit of anyone attending your event, just don't try. Seriously. No effort is almost always worse than a bad effort. At least the latter shows you care.

Anyway, remarkably less enthused, I made my way over to the line and waited. And waited. The most interesting part was the small talk with the organizers and some of the other waiting people. Not only that, but the line moved so slowly... If I hadn't been really committed to meeting the devs, I likely would have just walked away.

I mostly stayed on my phone during my wait, but the few times I glanced up, something caught my eye.

Every person who left seemed out of place. I don't know how to describe my feelings at the time. I think at first, I thought they were all depressed.

At first, I assumed it was just general disappointment. But the more I observed, the more they seemed genuinely sad. A good portion of those who left were crying. Total strangers would exchange silent hugs. There was just this heaviness that I couldn't perceive.

Little did I know that was a sneak peek at what was to come. My attention was immediately caught as I shifted my focus to the front door.

At first, I thought I was being deluded. I had to be. But the more I watched, the more I noticed that not everyone who went inside came back out. You wouldn't see it at a glance. The frequency was irregular. Masterfully so. Just a few people vanishing here and there, never enough to trigger alarm. Maybe they stayed for an extra autograph? Maybe there was a back door? Rational questions.

What's harder to rationalize is why they never returned to the only available parking lot. How many confused office workers glanced at them and quietly wondered? How many people were tasked with removing them and brushed off the creeping question: *Where did the owners go?* The thought of the empty cars sitting there, waiting for someone who would never return... It bugs me. I still get the ick when I see a car that's been sitting empty in one spot for too long.

After what felt like forever, I finally made it to the front of the line. A guy in oversized sunglasses gave me a lazy nod toward the office entrance.

The moment I stepped inside, I got hit with a blast of cold air. One of their hit game soundtracks was playing through some cheap, blown-out speakers, filling the space with tinny noise. Behind a desk sat a balding clerk, half-buried in a sea of paperwork with a few suspicious cans lying about.

Off to the side stood a single orange door. Taped to the frame was a scrap of paper with the poorly written words ""Dev Team.""

I glanced around, expecting more before mentally chastising myself, given how the rest of the event had gone. Couldn't exactly expect much more than what I was seeing. Aside from a dusty life-size cutout of one of their big-name characters, the room was depressingly bare. No merch. No excited fans. No energy. Just recycled air, bad music, and the sense that maybe this wasn't worth the $40.

We exchanged a few awkward hellos, and he slid a thick stack of paperwork my way. By then, I had already begun to feel that I no longer wanted to do this. But I'd come all this way. Spent the gas. Took the day off. At that point, it made more sense to just get it over with.

I signed the forms and returned them. He took them, looked down, and hesitated. Then he let out a deep sigh and rubbed his temples.

""Long day, man?"" I asked him, trying to keep it light.

He stared at me longer than necessary, then let out a short, tired laugh. ""Yeah. Long day,"" he said before rattling off a canned spiel about NDAs and basic rules. Then he pointed toward the orange door, plastered a half-hearted smile on his face, and said, ""Good luck.""

Ready to get my answers and promptly leave, I walk toward the door and give the man behind the desk, who had now moved to silently playing on his phone, one final half-smile.

Touching the doorknob was like plunging my hand into dry ice. An instant, burning cold made me yank back with a gasp while instinctively shooting a look at the guy behind the desk. My shocked and angry expression spoke for me.

He glanced up, gave me a lazy shrug, and went right back to scrolling on his phone.

I wrapped my sleeve around my hand and tried again, gripping the cold metal through the fabric. This time, the door creaked open.

Inside, shadows swallowed everything. The only light came from the sickly blue glow of scattered computer monitors.

As I stepped in, the door clicked shut behind me. The awful music from the lobby vanished, smothered by thick silence broken only by a low electrical hum and a slight burning smell.

""...H-Hello?"" I called out, my words eaten by the dark.

I like to consider myself a rational person. I knew from the jump that this whole experience was off, and whatever *this* was, it set my danger signals to one hundred.

I spun back toward the door and reached for the knob—only to recoil again. It was colder now. Not just cold—biting. My fingers stung on contact like I'd touched dry steel in a snowstorm. I forced myself to try again. It didn't budge.

I swore under my breath and pounded on the door. ""Hey! Hey!""

Nothing.

I hit it again, harder this time—desperate now—but no answer came. I tried again. Nothing. Like a caged animal, I pulled and twisted, hoping I could tear down the only thing keeping me from safety. But with each failed attempt, the cold reality sank in that I was alone. The hum and the dark were my only company.

I let out a frustrated scream into the nothing before turning to face the dark room again. My eyes strained, hunting for some other way out—anything that wasn't a dead end. I crept toward the soft glow of one of the computer screens, moving slowly when my shin knocked into something solid.

I froze.

Reaching out, my fingers brushed against the back of something hard. Cautiously, I felt around the object until my mind pieced together what it was from the little light in the room. It was a chair.

Figuring maybe I could use it to reach a vent or something, I swirled the object toward me and before I even had time to process why, I was already falling back hard onto the floor.

Someone was sitting in it. Slumped, still, almost posed.

The dim monitor light cast a sickly blue glow over his face, but it wasn't the screen that drew my eye.

It was his mouth.

It hung unnaturally wide—distended, broken-looking—and from within, a striped red-and-blue light spun like a siren buried in his throat. The flickering cast shadows across his gaunt face, dancing over skin pulled tight to the bone. Whatever fat or muscle he'd once had was long gone. He looked... consumed. Like he'd been starved from the inside out.

His hands gripped the arms of the chair so tightly they seemed fused to it—flesh sunken, knuckles bone-white, fingernails blackened.

His clothes hung off him in tatters, dusted in long strands of white hair that looked like they'd once belonged to a full head of shoulder-length hair.

But it was his eyes... Or... The absence of them—that made my breath catch.

His eye sockets gaped impossibly wide, empty but surgically clean. Not a drop of blood, not a shred of tissue. Just polished hollows where his eyes should've been.

And yet, somehow, they weren't empty.

Because inside each socket, suspended in the void, spun another light—identical to the one in his mouth. Red and blue. Rotating. Silent. Hypnotic.

I found myself staring. Trapped in those pits. Caught in the endless cycle of color and motion. I don’t know how long I was lost there, only that I snapped out of it with a sharp slap to my own face. Then I kicked the corpse away from me, hard.

My breathing turned erratic. My thoughts were a storm of confusion and panic.

I had to find a way out. Now.

I shot to my feet, fumbling for my phone, and flicked on the flashlight, desperately looking for another way out, but nearly dropped it when something on the man's monitor caught my attention.

Lines of code were appearing on the screen. Then vanishing. Then reappearing. As if someone were typing and deleting in real time.

I moved to the next workstation. Another body. Same position. Same spinning lights.

Code was being written there as well. I moved to the next. And the next.

Every screen. Every corpse. Every one of them still writing.

I’m no game developer, but I couldn’t stop myself from looking closer. Even with my limited understanding, it was clear—this was game code.

Someone had to see this. I hit record and made a second round, capturing all of the bodies and their workstations, hoping that as soon as I got out, I'd take it to everyone I could think of. The police, friends, and family. Hell, I would drive to the state capital and show it to the governor if I had to. Whatever was happening here couldn't be kept a secret.

And then, the silence broke.

It was subtle—barely there. In any other setting, I might’ve missed it entirely.

The faintest sound of an inhale.

I turned toward the sound, my heart hammering against my ribs. One of them—the one nearest to me—its jaw twitched. A tiny, grotesque motion, like it was struggling to open wider, to pull in more air.

I stepped closer.

The mouth opened further, joints clicking. The breath came again—deeper this time.

They were breathing.

I turned on my phone's flashlight, desperately looking around the room for a way out.

And the lights... God, the lights...

The lights in their eyes started spinning faster. The speed increasing in sync with the breaths. It was like they were waking up.

I turned my phone's flashlight back on and swept it across the room, panic now in full bloom. There had to be another way out—there had to be.

But the walls were bare. No windows. No vents. I was alone with the glowing screens and breathing corpses.

I turned and bolted back to the door.

I grabbed the knob again, but this time, the cold was even deeper. It burned my skin, but I didn't let go. I couldn't. All the while, I'm banging and screaming at the top of my lungs.

""Please, for the love of God, HELP me!""

**Bang. Bang. Bang.**

The breaths were growing deeper, heavier. I knew I was running out of time.

I slammed my fists against the door, harder, faster. From behind me, I heard it—the soft creak of old chairs turning in unison.

**Bang. Bang.**

“Help!” I screamed. Desperate. Raw.

A wet cough echoed from the room. One of the corpses was waking up.

They were coming.

“Goddammit!” I yelled.

And then—

Daylight.

I flew out the tiny crack, turning for a final glance just in time to see one of the corpses illuminated by the light, its neck cracking as it fully rotated toward me. Its jaw popped as it attempted to communicate. And then, in a loud whisper that didn't match the movement of its mouth, it spoke.

Standing above me was the man from the front desk, arms crossed, face twisted with barely concealed annoyance, like I'd spilled coffee on his favorite keyboard.

""Alright. That's enough,"" he said flatly. ""You need to leave.""

I scrambled upright, gasping, trying to piece together a coherent sentence—anything to make him understand. I babbled about the bodies, the lights, the breathing, the code.

He held up a finger to his lips and then pointed at the door. All while giving me a look that clearly stated, ""You're crazy.""

I stared back, confused. How could he not get it? I wasn't crazy. I had seen what I saw. The man himself was mere feet from the door. And if others were experiencing the same thing within minutes of each other, I'd imagine all of them would be as disturbed as I am. So... What the hell?

At first, I didn't want to leave. I couldn't leave. There were people in there who clearly needed help. And I'd already seen others go in and never come out. I begged the man to listen.

That's when two large guys materialized out of nowhere and physically removed me from the building. No discussion.

Later, I got a text. No pleasantries—just a reminder that everything I saw and heard that day was protected under the NDA I signed. And a warning that this company had no qualms about launching life-ruining lawsuits to protect its secrets.

At first, I didn't care. What I had recorded clearly crossed a line—this wasn't just a breach of contract but a serious criminal offense.

Then, I tried to check the footage.

Corrupted. Every file.

Of course.

The only thing left was to call the police. I lied. Said there were sick people inside, possibly in danger. But I didn't stick around. I couldn't bring myself to be there when they showed up.

To this day, as far as I know, there's never been a news story. No investigation. No PR nightmare for the company. Only silence.

I wish I could take anything from any of this. As far as I know, I don't have clinical depression. But I felt like I was right there for a couple of months.

The game eventually came out to great reviews, and of course, I couldn't bring myself to play it. Or any of their other games, for that matter.

It's weird. You'd think any mention of that studio or their IPs would send me into a full-blown panic, but it's not like that. Not at all. I do have this lingering dread that follows. But it's almost like my abject fear is stuck in that place. Or rather, with that place.

I mean, hell, I don't even know if whatever I experienced has anything to do with the studio in question. To that point, I conducted research on who was involved with the actual game, and none of the names of the development team that I allegedly met were listed.

But still. They were coding something, right? I mean, I saw them building a game.

I think of all this. The thing I think back on most was when the last corpse turned to me. He said something that was undeniably the most true thing I know about this situation.

He said, ""I'm in hell.""

Whoever you are or were, I'm sorry.

Last thing. And I almost forgot this one. For a while, I was getting these weird calls. At first, I thought they were just promotional robocalls telling me to buy their games because I had been placed on a list somewhere.

One day, I grew tired of the spam and said something less than pleasant on the phone. Immediately, the guy on the other end pauses and tells me, ""Remember to keep your fucking mouth shut."" He proceeded to list off my home address and where I worked at the time. Then, he hung up and for years, he never called back.

It wasn't until after I tried communicating with that random commentor that I finally received another call. The call that set me on the path here today.

He didn't speak for long. He didn't need to. I'll remember his words forever. He said, ""You almost broke your silence. It's too bad. We know you have great eyes for gaming. Next time, we'll use them.""

To this day, I don't know what to do with that.

Before anyone asks, no, I'm not saying the location of the offices or releasing any information about anything. I just... Can't. Even if I could, I don't believe anyone should be digging into this.

Honestly, I wish I could end this off with something... I don't know. Important? Meaningful? However, I don't have anything to offer. Like I said earlier, I'm just a scared guy who needed to vent. However, I appreciate anyone who took the time to read this.

At the very least, I can offer you this parting piece of advice. Be really careful which doors you step through. You never know what you'll find on the other side.",2,1748573478.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

I recently caught a movie and happened to be sitting next to an attractive guy who showed up with what appeared to be his parents, but I was pretty confident he was def my age range. There was a joke he made about us being together when the server came to get my order since I hit my seat button for service. I decided hec what do I have to lose and chose to leave a note on the back of my receipt that summed up to say:

This is odd, but if you ever want to grab coffee or catch a movie text me and I left my name and #. As we were leaving the theatre I gave it to him. 

He texted me that night and friended each other on social media and then we texted a bit the following day and there was def some back and forth flirting and we left off with potential plans to do something soon. He was upfront about not being on the market for anything except connections/friendships as he is very work involved and travels a lot. Which I aligned with and don’t mind as I’m not sure that I’m looking for anything serious or more than that myself right now.

I was recently commissioned by a host of a politics/economics podcast to draw a YouTube thumbnail for one of their episodes. The theme was Trump’s “big beautiful bill” so they wanted me to reference the bill from the schoolhouse rock episode in a “bloated” state as a caricature of the actual bill.

I was confused why they chose me tbh, my background is a furry inflation artist but I guess one of the hosts (probably the bald one?) knew me from my previous work.

Once I confronted him about this he got very angry. Since then he has been spamming me with threatening pictures of his face superimposed onto what appears to be a dining utensils that it crashed my internet.

1kytdas,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kytdas,My partner’s coffee plant… I have to save her!,"Long story short, love of my life moves in with me, their once thriving beloved coffee plant begins to get a bit droopy and sad. 
Trying to diagnose the issue, we move it to a sunnier window in the bathroom. Shortly, the leaves began to scald. We moved it to the kitchen with less light, now it is no longer burned but now the poor thing looks very sick. Leaves are beginning to loose shine, look veiny, before becoming yellow and falling off. It certainly has gone through a lot and is struggling with something more. The current window it is in now gets good, indirect light with a little bright sunrise ray and is rotated fairly regularly. The environment is not unlike when it was thriving here- my instinct says it might have become root bound or have some sort of rot for one reason or another. I know it likely may need a touch of pruning eventually, but I am terrified to deal any sort of blow to this plant that may cause it to truly give up.

Before I attempt to extract her from her pot, to be moved to a slightly larger clay pot, and see whats up. I would love any and all advice for what else I could be doing for this plant- I would love any help, tips, things to look our for. Ive managed to save a lot of plants from the brink, but this beloved coffee plant seems to be my biggest challenge yet! Help!

(Extra details: This plant gets watered whenever the soil begins to feel dry to the fingertip, it gets pretty decent drainage from the bottom of the clay pot. Provided pictures are the current state of the plant, and old pictures from when it was healthy and young some years ago)

Details are: 

- 1st date was coffee for an hour, cut short because I had to go to a house inspection afterwards. 2nd date was a wine bar for 2.5 hours, we had work the next day so didn’t go that late. Easy conversation (although some awkward silences still) and heaps in common. This is less time than the first date with both ex boyfriends which worries me a bit, as those felt more natural/romantic. My last boyfriend, we’d already kissed, texted a lot and cuddled by the 3rd date.
- There were parts of the 2nd date where I felt super attracted to him/butterflies but then other parts where I really didn’t. This has never happened to me before.
- We haven’t had much physical contact on either date (apart from hello/goodbye hugs) but he was leaning closer to me at the wine bar and said he definitely wants to see me again at the end of our 2nd date. We don’t text that much between dates which is unlike my exes too, where I got really excited about messages. 
- I’m stressed because sometimes I did want to kiss him (I also miss physical closeness) but other times I really didn’t/the idea of it stressed me out. 

My last relationship: 
I was blindsided by a breakup before this (2yr relationship ended 1yr 4months ago - avoidant ex) which hit me really hard. I’ve done therapy and all the stuff you’re supposed to do. I’m craving intimacy (and know it’s been a while) but also feel scared at the idea of it which is frustrating.

I’m stressed because my last 2 boyfriends, I had zero doubts about from first meeting them. I instantly wanted them and things flowed very easily. Texting/banter was better with both of them also. But they were also more “smooth”, very forward and maybe too ‘player-ish’. They both had commitment issues and I feel saw relationships as replaceable because getting women is easy for them. This guy is more introverted and not forward at all. 

Tl;dr Should I give it a 3rd date or is my confusion/lack of excitement about this current guy a bad sign? I’ve always prided myself on being black and white with guys - I’m either super into it or not at all. I’ve never been in-between those feelings with someone before and I can’t help comparing to my exes which felt different in the beginning, even if they didn’t work out.

I’ve been drowning in disposable coffee pods for way too long, feeling guilty about the waste and annoyed by the cost. Then I found these reusable coffee pods made specifically for the Ninja Dual Brew and Dual Brew Pro, and honestly, it’s been a game-changer. The stainless steel mesh filter makes a smooth cup without the gritty bits, and the BPA-free plastic keeps things safe without messing with the flavor.

Filling them up is super simple thanks to the wide opening, and the snap-tight lid means zero leaks while brewing. Cleanup is just as easy, you can rinse them under the tap or toss them in the dishwasher without a second thought. Whether I want a bold or mellow brew, these pods handle both perfectly and fit all the settings on my machine.

They’re lightweight and durable too, so I take them everywhere, home, office, even travel. If you’re tired of tossing pods and spending too much, give these a shot. Saving money and the planet? Win-win.

DICLAIMER:: This is a fictional/confessional story I generated for fun — not a real experience.

I don’t really use Reddit, but my wife said I should write this down because she hasn’t stopped laughing since I told her.

Anyway. I’m a department manager at a mid-sized marketing firm. I’m in my early 50s, been in the game for over 25 years, and I like to think I’ve seen it all. I deal with everything from interns ghosting on their second day to clients sending feedback in Comic Sans. Nothing surprises me anymore.

Or so I thought.

So yesterday, I’m sitting at my desk at home, quietly sipping my coffee, catching up on Slack messages, when my phone buzzes. It’s a text from one of my employees, let’s call him Jake (not his real name, obviously). Great guy, solid worker, a little too fond of emojis in professional emails but otherwise dependable.

I glance at the preview, expecting something like “Hey, quick question about the client deck.” Instead, I see:

“Mmm, I can’t wait to peel that off you tonight. You better not wear anything under it. 😈🔥🍆”

At first I just… stared at it. Thought maybe it was some weird spam or maybe he got hacked.

Nope. Sent directly from his number. My work phone. My professional line. With the eggplant emoji. The goddamn eggplant emoji.

Now, I’ve got a pretty good poker face, but I swear to God I made this full-body noise like a dying accordion. I dropped my pen. My coffee sloshed. My dog looked at me like “You good?” I was not good.

Then, two minutes later, a follow-up:

“OH MY GOD. I am so sorry, that was meant for my girlfriend. Deeply inappropriate. I sincerely apologize. Please disregard.”

What can you even do in that situation?

I sat there, feeling 47 different kinds of secondhand embarrassment. I didn’t want to make it worse by joking about it (because what if he’s freaking out?), but I also didn’t want to be cold and make him feel like I was preparing to fire him or report him to HR.

So I just replied with the most neutral, corporate dad message I could muster:

“Please be more careful with your messages in the future. Also, I would prefer not to receive eggplant emojis from my staff.”

And then I immediately walked out of my office, looked at my wife and said, “I think I just got sexted by Jake.”

She’s been calling me “babe” and sending me eggplant emojis ever since.

Today we had our regular one-on-one on Zoom. Poor guy looked like he hadn’t slept. His eyes darted everywhere except at the camera. I said “Let’s keep it professional” at one point — about a completely unrelated topic — and I could see him die a little inside.

Anyway. I’m not mad. I’m not even really weirded out. Just… exhausted. Being a manager in 2025 means half your job is doing actual work, and the other half is accidentally becoming a side character in someone’s romantic comedy gone wrong.

If nothing else, I’ve now been sent an unsolicited sext and an eggplant emoji by someone who once gave a 10-minute presentation on ad retargeting.

1kyt6ju,https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/1kyt6ju/hat_tip_to_your_community_from_a_kraken_fan_not/,Hat tip to your community from a Kraken fan. (<-- not game related),"I was really impressed by the way your community rallied to honor Scheifele's late father, and for the Ben Stelter Foundation fundraiser before that (following the La Bamba incident). You have my respect and appreciation for these gestures. It speaks to the character of this community, especially considering the depth of the rivalries (especially with Edmonton). Nicely done, y'all.

 The thing is, I already knew this about r/DallasStars. Two years ago, the Kraken faced the Stars in the second round of the playoffs, and instead of the usual adversarial, toxic back-and-forth between subreddits that you'd expect in any given series, our respective subreddits did it differently. It started with[ this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/DallasStars/comments/135nba6/kraken_fan_here_made_this_to_kick_off_the_second/) (still funny), and continued with a lighthearted, respectful, often silly banter between our subs that really embodied good sportsmanship and healthy rivalry. The entire series marked a good moment in time that I'll always remember fondly. For anyone that was here for that series, let me just keep the PG-rated trash talking going: IF ANY OF YOU SCOUNDREL STARS FANS EVEN THINK OF VISITING THE SEATTLE AREA, BE WARNED WE'LL HAPPILY MEET UP WITH YOU AND BUY YOU A BEER/COFFEE/MILK.

 So, in the spirit of respect, comradery, and good taste in sports, I made a Dallas Stars puck display model, intended for 3D printing. It's the second in a series (apparently!) that started with the Kraken display shown. Each face is separated for easy multi-color printing, but the relief I've added to the logo's facets means that it'll have some definition if printed in one color. The display *should* be free-standing without feet (with the puck in the display, the center of mass is just right), but I've included small feet to be printed separately if necessary. The model is [available on Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7052093). Brand color codes[ available here (link to PDF)](https://media.d3.nhle.com/image/private/t_document/prd/fnfrr6spowanebh2oqr0.pdf) for those looking to get the right filaments.

\[edit\] The pics aren't showing up on mobile, which is irritating. The Thingiverse post has pics (and if you're interested, the Kraken model will be under my profile link).

1kyt1dt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1kyt1dt/freezing_for_apparently_no_reason/,Freezing for apparently no reason,"Hey everyone, I'm at my wits end. I'll go over my freezing experience in detail.

Before you ask, yes, I use mods.

TLDR; The first time I had freezes I tried everything and in the end deleting outpost links fixed it. Now freezing is back from nowhere and I can't seem to fix it.

The detailed version:

A few days ago I managed to solve a freezing issue that had made me quit playing the game entirely. The game would freeze every minute or so for 10+ seconds, with CPU usage dropping to 0%. Saving the game also caused it to freeze for a few seconds and took way longer than usual (10-15 seconds per save, even quicksaves, plus throwing the ""Starfield is not responding"" for a few seconds until it finished saving).

Every thread I came across either recommended limiting CPU usage, cleaning save bloat, deleting excess save files, reinstalling, checking drivers, etc. I tried basically everything, including upgrading my PC pretty substantially (way better CPU, 16gb of extra ram, new cooler in case it was thermal throttling).

In the end, it ended up being an issue with having complex cargo links and outpost extractor-storage links. which nobody had mentioned until I randomly found a thread talking about it. I deleted the landing pads and one outpost and it instantly fixed itself. I happily returned to playing as normal. The time it took to save the game also dropped dramatically.

A couple hours ago, however, I was playing as I'd been for the last few days, doing the Deserted Trade Authority spacer cleanup mission, when suddenly the game froze as it used to before the outpost fix. Saving the game also takes longer now, like it used to before I fixed it.

I instantly tried deleting my production outpost but that didn't change anything. I passed an in game month in Venus and that didn't change anything either. I deleted my other outpost (no resource production, just buildings) as well and that didn't fix anything either. I manually cleared DX shaders, and that didn't fix anything. I removed **BlueprintShips-Starfield.esm** as a dependency on all flagged mods, and it did nothing.

It's not thermal throttling, it's not CPU usage over 100% (it consistently stays below 50%), it's not outdated drivers, it's not from the new update since I haven't updated so as not to risk breaking my mods, and I heavily doubt it's save bloating as I cleaned my saves not that long ago and the files are \~25mb in size, and it's not too many save files either as it still happens with 2 save files total.

I'm slowly losing my mind.

If any of you has a suggestion, no matter how trivial, simple, or outlandish it may sound, please share it. I'm willing to cast spells at my PC if needed. Seriously, I'm desperate.

Thanks in advance.

1kyt0pl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Puppyblues/comments/1kyt0pl/guidance_needed_in_my_newly_rehomed_10_month_old/,Guidance needed in my newly rehomed 10 month old puppy,"Hi All!
I’m looking for any kind advice or guidance on a 10 month old Maltese x Shitzu x Bichon  I brought home on Monday that was needing to be rehomed, I’m going to get a professional trainer in and keep working with him but I wanted honest advice on whether another environment might be better for him given his background and needs.

I realised on the day I took him, and it’s becoming even more apparent that the owners didn’t understand him and his needs very well and haven’t been upfront about everything. They had previously rehomed him for one night the week prior but ended up taking him back because the guy was a creep (long story). So I figured he wasn’t in the right home and they clearly weren’t vetting people correctly so I would take him regardless as I know I was a better fit than the current owners. Their reason for rehoming is that he was escaping through their fencing and their landlord will not fix/amend their fencing (however after seeing the fencing they could’ve put mesh and cable ties to cover the space he was escaping from). For context he was adopted when he was about 9 weeks old as a puppy and they’ve said they think he was the runt of the litter. His previous owners live on a 2 acre property with a massive house and four young kids and another large dog which they failed to tell me about till I went to see him - I didn’t see a strong emotional bond with the dog but now I do believe the other dog was providing him with some sort of emotional regulation by presence. Before I went there I asked a lot of questions back and forth to ensure I was a good fit and if he would need to perhaps go to a bigger space. They said he was a chill dog, loved people and other dogs, saw everyone as a friend and didn’t need further training, socialised well. I was told he doesn’t get separation anxiety and is fine being left alone at home. Which is all untrue and he barely knows sit. They also never took him for walks because he would just run around outside when his owners were out there and that he hasn’t  destroy anything within the home. He won’t nap during the day unless I’m laying down and not moving around so I assumed that was also the same his last place so he was just outside and following his owners around all day, not sleeping. To also add, the owner told me two different birthdays that were incorrect, his microchip is still registered to the breeders and they said he was 2kg when he’s 6.5kg.

I am in my mid thirties and live alone in a one bedroom apartment with access to a large grassed courtyard area that he needs to remain on lead for due to strata and also other people/dogs who have access to courtyard. I also never realised till I brought him home how loud the traffic was, but I have continuous ASMR puppy music on. I have time to invest in him now but I also feel like I can’t leave my apartment because it’s too much for him.
I need to start uni in August which needs my full attention and will take a lot out of me as I also have ADHD and in November I need to visit a relative via plane who is elderly and this might be the last time I see them so I will need him to stay with someone or get someone to stay here. I’m extremely burnt out right now, which has reduced my appetite and made me sick which rarely happens. Overall I have a lot of love to give but I’m a very independent person - calm, rest, downtime and a clean space are an essential for me.

Yesterday it was almost like he was regressing and he’s started wincing, tearing up coffee table books, clawing at my couch, jumping up onto my dining table etc. I feel a bit stupid because I set my space up for a dog that is chill and trained rather than a dog that is very sensitive, has been both under stimulated and overstimulated and needs boundaries and structure and I feel like a bit of an idiot and that I’ve let us both down. He’s also not toileting as regularly as he should be yet but I’ve managed to get him to go a few times in the courtyard on lead, and he went to pee by the front door overnight last night which is the first time he’s gone inside (Had a vet check up, nothing medical going on). I take him to toilet/walk in the courtyard area but sometimes he gets overstimulated by the sounds and smells as it can be different every time if people are on their balconies. I finally got a bit of sleep for the first time last night. He does sleep in my room and actually is pretty good with sleeping in the night but jumped up on me wanting to play and lick this morning at 5am so I redirected him to calm behaviour.  

I put on an adaptil collar last night so I hope that might actually help, I’ve brought in a playpen but haven’t enforced anything yet, but will slowly start to get him used to the area with nourishment, treats etc. It’s not enclosed yet but I’m using it as a barrier to the front door and to stop him wincing and clawing at the door.
Do you think it’s too late to try and get him crate trained? I don’t know if he’ll see this as a punishment as he’s always had free roam of space.
I know he’s decompressing and things take time but this poor little guy has lots of emotions and is very sensitive. As I’ve said I am getting a trainer in and know that will take time but wanted honest opinions if he’s better to be rehomed somewhere with less traffic, another well behaved dog for co regulation when owners aren’t home and access to a backyard where he can go to the toilet and run around freely when he wants to. I’m willing to do whatever is best for him.

“Yes?” 

“The audience would like more tap dance, correct,” Bride ask the detective. “They want you to kill me off?”

This time the detective holds a small bullet up to the Bride’s head as warning and starts reading an article. 

“Day 18 of governmental riots lead by the Bride of Phantoms,”  the detective says sternly.  He pauses, “what do you have to say for your self?”

The  Bride pauses to sip her coffee. It’s the first coffee she had since she left the ship hull that had her imprisoned.  The Brides not going down.  The detective will learn that. 

The Bride smiles, “I’m just enjoying my coffee, sir, nothing more.” 

“Really? You think you don’t have to answer me?” The detective asking snidely.

The Bride snickers. “Take a good look. I boarded up the windows of my house.  I lost my life blood.  My trade.  I’ve been looted three times.  I’ve been imprisoned in a haunted ship where everyone tried to murder me.  What are you going to do for me besides get out of my way!”

“You gotta be kidding me! You who ruined the last simulation with all your bot roleplayers that RUINED the illusion and cost a dozen people to lose their gambling bets,” the detective snipes bitterly.  He holds up his electric dog catching net to show the Bride he means business.


“Oh yes, sir, I’m hear to tell you that the Smileys are going to release another wave of the virus.  Go ahead and kill me off, it won’t stop it you’ll see. The replication already began.”

The Bride lost patience and shapeshifts to dog.  “I’m a real bitch so deal with it. Woof woof,” she barks knowing the detective will use his dog catcher net to kill her simulation.

“You gotta be kidding me,” screams the detective. 

The Bride in dog form speaks, “...more severe measures will be implemented according to the Compound.  You have not understood having fun, detective.”

The Bride as the Dog bites the detective  in the pants.  

The detective hits here with his electric dog catcher and ends The Brides simulation. “Take the red pill,” he screams hitting her in so much slow motion that he earns fifty ghost coins. 


The Brides ghost rises up alive but this time as deadly wafting stench to speak to the detective, “the next wave of the virus will infect the audience with anal retention. Extreme gas pain will occur from them holding in sharts.  Nothing you do can save them.”

The Bride as a Ghost speaks directly to the detective’s camera.  She knows the detective is televising this for the gamblers watching.  

“You can place a bounty on my head, fellows.  But I am everywhere.”


“I am Chaos,” she sings, “I am the infinite order spawning.  See me sprawling?  Try to escape me.  You can’t.  I am mercury in your fingers. I am the anus, the mouth and the endless black hole shitting.  I poot on you.  I am Chaos magic.”

1kysxuu,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kysxuu/why_does_pretty_privilege_suck_so_much_my_coffee/,Why does pretty privilege suck so much? My coffee shop experience and beyond,"Okay, I just need to get this off my chest because it’s been bugging me for weeks.

So me and my friend always go to this coffee shop. Lately, there’s this guy working there who keeps giving my friend a *medium* iced cappuccino even though she only pays for a *small*. Like, he literally argues with his coworkers and leaves the counter (even with a line behind us!) just to make sure she gets the bigger drink. And me? I always get exactly what I ordered — no extras, no freebies.

Then, another coworker started giving my other pretty friend ( lol) free coffee every single day and even asked for her Instagram. This friend is considered “pretty” by society’s standards, and I think that’s why she’s getting all this special treatment. Meanwhile, my other friend — who’s not “pretty” by those standards — had her order messed up and got a hot cocoa that tasted nasty. Like, the difference is so obvious and it hurts.

I’ve tried to stand up for myself and ask why she gets treated that way, but my friend brushes me off. She says I’m being dramatic or that it’s just because she’s a regular customer. But honestly, I don’t buy it. I think it’s because she fits this narrow idea of “pretty” and that’s why she gets the special treatment.

And here’s the thing : I don’t get that treatment. I get the regular order. No freebies, no special attention. Sometimes, it even feels like I’m invisible or not worth the same kindness just because I don’t fit society’s “pretty” mold. It’s frustrating and it makes me feel uglier sometimes, even though I know I shouldn’t compare myself like that.

It’s not just about coffee. It’s about feeling seen and valued. It’s about how people — especially men treat you differently because of how you look. Even at school, teachers treat the “pretty” white girls differently more attention, more patience, more chances. The rest of us? We’re kinda invisible.

I cry sometimes when I’m frustrated about all this, but I can’t say that out loud because then my friends will think I’m jealous or “too emotional.”They also say that they come there regulary but the so do I and so do my not so pretty friend and we never get anything extra. But it’s not about jealousy or coffee it’s about fairness. It’s about dignity.

Honestly, what I really want is to be *seen* for who I am — not just judged by my looks. I want people to notice me for my kindness, my humor, my effort, and my heart. Is that too much to ask?

If you feel this too  like you’re being overlooked because of how you look, you’re not alone. It really sucks, and it’s okay to be upset about it :(",14,1748571511.0,offmychest,30,0.72,False

This is Day 1 of my journey to get people to use something I've been building for the last few months.

I'm Shivam , 21, a student from India. I built a web app— it's a place where early-stage founders and students with ideas/projects can find like-minded collaborators or even just get their startup idea validated.

I didn't have a network, co-founders, or any support when I started. So I built something I wish I had:

A space where your idea doesn’t die alone in your notes app.


It's raw. It's real. It’s not perfect, but it works — onboarding, posting, matching, chatting — all live.
I'm doing this without a team, funding, or paid ads. Just sweat, coffee, and code.

Would love it if you checked it out
Even if you don’t sign up, a simple upvote would mean a lot — I want this post to reach more people who might resonate with it.

Open to feedback, roast, questions, or just your thoughts ❤️
Thanks for reading. Let’s see where this goes.

1kysxag,https://www.reddit.com/r/Custodians/comments/1kysxag/i_messed_up_crying/,I messed up (crying),"TLDR; Been a full time night shift custodian at a smallish prek-8 school for the past 6 months and besides the strange distribution of tasks, my dickhead boss, me ruining my downtime for myself and the wicked calluses forming on my feet, it's overall been good.

I have by far the most intensive zone, I have to walk a minimum of 4 times around the entire school every night. I'm responsible for all hallways, 11 entrances 7 of which are vestibules, 2 superintendent secretaries offices, the entire big main office which itself has 3 smaller offices and a meeting room and a single toilet bathroom, the break/lounge/copy machine room, a library including 2 reading pits and 4 offices around the library, 2 disciplinary/kinder/stim rooms, 2 staff bathrooms each with a single toilet, the main cafeteria bathrooms with 11 toilets, the smaller but still full size gym, and all water fountains not near other bathrooms.

Last couple weeks I really started to dial in my area and methods, that along with skipping lunch and having no more snow meaning less trips to the ends of the whole school, I sometimes found myself with up to 4 hours of effective downtime.

I get that there's always something to do but do they seriously expect me to mop the edges of the hallways and scrub the bathroom walls every night while everyone else takes 10 smoke, coffee, and chew breaks? So after a while I got inspired by my well seasoned coworker always leaving for definitely longer than his prescribed break time, and quickly escalated my extended lunch to tripling it, which admittedly was insane and definitely pushing my limits to the max, I'd just leave and go live my life and come clock back out at time. Did that for a week and a half or so, really thought if I got caught they wouldn't care at this point but yesterday me and that other fast working custodian got the crackdown and yeah it's over, at least for me right now, I guess. Bossman was super pissed said he told the superintendent as well, even brang up how they could prosecute us or whatever, pretty much just got told to stop and mop the edges of the hallways if I get done early. 

Meanwhile a clear favorite of my supervisor seemingly gets to clean his areas whenever he wants, as he only does his gym twice a week. With by far the easiest zone as well consisting of 2 locker rooms with 2 total toilets that barely get used, a weight room that sees minimal use with a tiny single toilet bathroom, the art, tec ed, music, language, and home ec classrooms that are all tile, the front main vestibule and surrounding area in front of the main office that sees little-to-no traffic (all tile as well) a pair of smaller little kid bathrooms, and a single toilet staff bathroom, apparently I'm responsible to come mop a little 4 sq ft section under his 2 f-ing water fountains that are literally connected to his bathroom floors because he only mops to a certain tile line, in a similar vain I have to walk all the way down the one wing just to go in the gym office and change 3 little garbages; and last but not least one of the vestibules I'm responsible for literally leads directly into the area of someone else so that's another entire trip with the vacuum all the way down an entire wing just to go do that tiny area, but my boss wants to start going on about how ""we're a team"" after he realized I wasn't meshing well with mostly everyone else, what a crock. I think at this point I'm definitely being played with, mainly probably because I'm relatively young and to be very honest I don't think my boss or his golden boy like brown people. It feels like they all got together and came up with a bunch of bs to tack onto this zone before I came in... either way it's all corrupt all the way to the top, it's an unsubtle message that they're part of the club and I'm not.

And do I feel guilty ? Not really, I worked hard and busted my a$$ to finish early, I accomplished the same amount of work in 5 hours that used to take me the full 8 and did more than the last guy who consistently took most of the full 8. It's not as if me taking my sweet time or being bored and miserable at the school has any effect on how clean my area is, everything still gets cleaned so what's the big deal? So now I guess it's time to drag a$$ all night and take a good 6+ hours to clean an already mostly clean area like everyone else because apparently they're paying me to suffer, but I digress, still the best gig I've had, definitely beats sitting in the soup aisle all night and morning at Wally World... but yeah I don't expect any sympathy I know a lot more people work a lot tougher routes, I just needed to vent to some people that actually get it and just cut the bs.",1,1748571461.0,Custodians,4,0.6,False

A clear struggle, for the creature surely is unable to understand who or what it is, where it is, and why it is even alive. 

Suddenly it cries out. In pain or confusion, it is not known by, but it cries. Skeletal bones wrapped in synthetic and real flesh reach for its face, attempting to feel itself in some way. Fingers twisting and cracking as they reach out. 

Metal creaking muscles and structure force the creature on its feet with a groan, faltering slightly in an attempt to stand. Synthetic hands reach out forward into the light, trying to get out of this wretched body.

Twisting, sprawling weaves of wires sewn into inorganic flesh across joints of the body, blood replaced by oil and wiring. Haphazardly done by someone with a clear lack of inexperience but the pure height of fantasticism. 

The torso is even more of a disaster than the arms of the poor creature. A grotesque mix of organic, synthetic, and industrial components jambled together in a robust attempt to create something that can live and exist. 

A creation of pure adoration and admiration of *something* but something so clearly unknown and not understood. 

The thing attempts one more time to stand, placing those jumbled wires of hands onto the floor to help steady the weight of the uneven, displaced body it houses.

After a struggle, the creature stands somewhat awkwardly on its feet, and begins to walk with a stumble and lurch. The left leg is slightly longer than its right.

Eyes clink back and forth, robotically, in fractions and increments. Unevenly and slowly, then janky and quickly. Disorienting and distracting.

Language is lost on the creature as it babbles sounds together, stringing them along in a half sentence in such a way a baby and some sort of hypothetical alien would, vocal cords unable to emit anything else.

The stitching down the belly of the creature is massively uneven and lopsided. A plastic tube juts out from the torso, the skin almost *rotting* and *sagging*. 

Several orphaned wires hang loosely, decidedly left alone and eventually discarded and forgotten about. Perhaps it would not all be so wrong if there were no exposed organs, but towards the end of the torso, in a cut in the skin lies an attempt of an intestine, slightly brown and dying already. 

The quiet hum of metal breathing in and out builds to scraping metal, sliding harshly back and forth in an attempt to regulate feelings and soothe the creature. 

It takes one more glance across the now dark room. Feeling around one last time, the creature finds a coffee mug and cradles it in its hands. Perhaps this will guide it to where it belongs. ",9,1748571407.0,shortscarystories,1,1.0,False

[[Explore Top Rated high top patio table and chairs on amazon.]](https://site.trendsupplier.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=high top patio table and chairs)

## Key Features Analysis

The selection of high-top patio sets available in 2025 includes a wide range of materials and construction techniques designed to withstand the elements. Quality materials and durable construction are essential for longevity and usability.**Frame Material:** The frames are typically constructed from powder-coated aluminum or rust-proof steel providing maximum durability.

Powder-coated aluminum frames offer lightweight durability and resistance to corrosion, making them ideal for coastal environments. These frames are designed to withstand prolonged exposure to the elements and can resist fading, chipping, and scratching. Rust-proof steel is a heavier option frequently enough used for its added stability and robust feel. Both aluminum and steel frames ensure the furniture retains its structure over time while minimizing maintenance requirements, making these materials a practical investment for long-term outdoor use.

**Tabletop Surface:** The tabletop surfaces may include tempered glass, polywood, or natural wood, each affecting aesthetics and maintenance requirements.

Tempered glass tabletops provide a sleek, modern aesthetic, resisting heat and breakage while being easy to clean.Polywood, a wood alternative made from recycled plastics, delivers a natural wood look without the maintenance requirements, being resistant to weather and minimizing wear.

1kyssay,https://www.reddit.com/r/puppy101/comments/1kyssay/guidance_needed_in_my_newly_rehomed_10_month_old/,Guidance needed in my newly rehomed 10 month old puppy,"Hi All!
I’m looking for any kind advice or guidance on a 10 month old Maltese x Shitzu x Bichon  I brought home on Monday that was needing to be rehomed, I’m going to get a professional trainer in and keep working with him but I wanted honest advice on whether another environment might be better for him given his background and needs.

I realised on the day I took him, and it’s becoming even more apparent that the owners didn’t understand him and his needs very well and haven’t been upfront about everything. They had previously rehomed him for one night the week prior but ended up taking him back because the guy was a creep (long story). So I figured he wasn’t in the right home and they clearly weren’t vetting people correctly so I would take him regardless as I know I was a better fit than the current owners. Their reason for rehoming is that he was escaping through their fencing and their landlord will not fix/amend their fencing (however after seeing the fencing they could’ve put mesh and cable ties to cover the space he was escaping from). For context he was adopted when he was about 9 weeks old as a puppy and they’ve said they think he was the runt of the litter. His previous owners live on a 2 acre property with a massive house and four young kids and another large dog which they failed to tell me about till I went to see him - I didn’t see a strong emotional bond with the dog but I do believe the other dog was providing him with some sort of emotional regulation by presence. Before I went there I asked a lot of questions back and forth to ensure I was a good fit and if he would need to perhaps go to a bigger space. They said he was a chill dog, loved people and other dogs, saw everyone as a friend and didn’t need further training, socialised well. I was told he doesn’t get separation anxiety and is fine being left alone at home. Which is all untrue and he barely knows sit. They also never took him for walks because he would just run around outside when his owners were out there and that he hasn’t  destroy anything within the home. He won’t nap during the day unless I’m laying down and not moving around so I assumed that was also the same his last place so he was just outside and following his owners around all day, not sleeping. To also add, the owner told me two different birthdays that were incorrect,  his microchip is still registered to the breeders and they said he was 2kg when he’s 6.5kg.

I am in my mid thirties and  live alone in a one bedroom apartment with access to a large grassed courtyard area that he needs to remain on lead for due to strata and also other people/dogs who have access to courtyard. I also never realised till I brought him home how loud the traffic was, but I have continuous ASMR puppy music on. I have time to invest in him now but I also feel like I can’t leave my apartment because it’s too much for him.
I need to start uni in August which needs my full attention and will take a lot out of me as I also have ADHD and in November I need to visit a relative via plane who is elderly and this might be the last time I see them so I will need him to stay with someone or get someone to stay here. I’m extremely burnt out right now, which has reduced my appetite and made me sick which rarely happens. Overall I have a lot of love to give but I’m a very independent person - calm, rest, downtime and a clean space are an essential for me.

Yesterday it was almost like he was regressing and he’s started wincing, tearing up coffee table books, pawing at my couch, jumping up onto my dining table etc. I feel a bit stupid because I set my space up for a dog that is chill and trained rather than a dog that is very sensitive, has been both under stimulated and overstimulated and needs boundaries and structure and I feel like a bit of an idiot and that I’ve let us both down. He’s also not toileting as regular as he should be yet but I’ve managed to get him to go a few times in the courtyard on lead, and he went to pee by the front door overnight last night which is the first time he’s gone inside (Had a vet check up, nothing medical going on). I take him to toilet/walk in the courtyard area but sometimes he gets overstimulated by the sounds and smells as it can be different every time if people are on their balconies. I finally got a bit of sleep for the first time last night. He does sleep in my room and actually is pretty good with sleeping in the night but jumped up on me wanting to play and lick this morning at 5am so I redirected him to calm behaviour.  

I put on an adaptil collar last night so I hope that might actually help, I’ve brought in a playpen but haven’t enforced anything yet, but will slowly start to get him used to the area with nourishment, treats etc.
Do you think it’s too late to try and get him crate trained? I don’t know if he’ll see this as a punishment as he’s always had free roam of space.
I know he’s decompressing and things take time but this poor little guy has lots of emotions and is very sensitive. As I’ve said I am getting a trainer in and know that will take time but wanted honest opinions if he’s better to be rehomed somewhere with less traffic, another well behaved dog for co regulation when owners aren’t home and access to a backyard where he can go to the toilet and run around freely when he wants to. I’m willing to do whatever is best for him.
Please be kind with responses!

I’ve been living in Boston the last 6 years (Back Bay area). Now I am relocating back to Denver* and starting to get cold feet (except job offer has been signed so it is happening). 

What areas are going to give me the same urban, green, walkable, clean, safe, a bit higher end feel as Back Bay? 

I was leaning towards lohi, but just google earthed my way around (like to a near by pilates studio etc) and it felt so bleak (?). It seemed like every street corner had a run down auto body shop or something similar. 

I just want to be able to walk to Pilates, core power, solidcore, a coffee shop, lunch spots, a grocery store, a decent green park (bonus if there’s a pond or water or something). And also not feel like the only person doing so if that makes sense? Like an area where everyone else is also walking around.

Alexander Zverev, the world's third-ranked tennis player, is looking to make a statement against Flavio Cobolli, the Hamburg winner. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, Zverev's first-round match was a bit of a snooze-fest, with him losing the first set 3-6 to Jesper de Jong. He eventually woke up, winning the next three sets 6-1, 6-2, 6-3. Talk about a morning coffee boost.

Now, Cobolli, on the other hand, is no pushover. He's got the skills, the talent, and the Italian flair to take on the big guns. But, let's be real, Zverev is a whole different beast. He's been to the semifinals four times in Paris and lost to Carlos Alcaraz in the final last year. The man's got experience, and experience is key on the clay courts of Roland-Garros.

The odds are in Zverev's favor, with BetRivers offering 1.2 for a Zverev win, and 4.6 for a Cobolli upset. The spread is -5.5 for Zverev, with BetMGM offering 1.74 for a Zverev win and 1.91 for a Cobolli cover.

My best bet? Zverev to win, but not by much. I'm taking the under 37.5 games, offered by BetUS at 1.87. Zverev's got the skills to take down Cobolli, but the Italian's got the grit to make it a close match. It'll be a battle, but in the end, Zverev's experience and talent will shine through.

So, there you have it, folks. Zverev to win, under 37.5 games. Don't @ me.

Kratom (*Mitragyna speciosa*) is a tropical tree indigenous to Southeast Asia, traditionally used for its stimulant and analgesic properties. Increasing interest in its various forms—powder, capsules, extracts, and tea—necessitates a detailed understanding of their distinct characteristics. This report provides a comprehensive analysis of these forms, examining their differences in potency, onset, duration, and convenience, and exploring the nuanced concept of ""effectiveness.""

The primary findings indicate that while each form offers unique advantages, ""effectiveness"" is highly subjective, depending on the desired physiological outcome (e.g., stimulant vs. sedative effects) and is significantly influenced by the concentration of active alkaloids, particularly 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH). Extracts generally offer the highest potency and fastest onset due to concentrated alkaloid content, including enhanced levels of 7-OH, which is a key mediator of analgesic effects. Powder and capsules provide more gradual and sustained effects, while tea offers a traditional, faster-absorbing liquid form with variable alkaloid extraction.

Crucially, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved kratom for any medical use and strongly advises against its consumption due to significant safety risks, including addiction, abuse, dependence, and severe adverse effects, some of which have been fatal. The unregulated nature of the market further exacerbates these risks, leading to inconsistent product quality, purity, and potency, making reliable and safe use inherently challenging. Given these substantial concerns, professional medical consultation is imperative before considering any use of kratom.

**1. Introduction to Kratom: Botanical Origin, Key Alkaloids, and Context**

**1.1. Botanical Origin and Traditional Uses**

Kratom, scientifically known as *Mitragyna speciosa* Korth., is a tropical tree belonging to the coffee family (Rubiaceae), native to various regions in Southeast Asia, including Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines, and New Guinea. Historically, the leaves of the kratom tree have been integral to traditional practices. Manual laborers in these regions commonly chewed fresh or dried kratom leaves or brewed them into tea to combat fatigue, enhance stamina, and increase tolerance to heat during long working hours.  

Beyond its use as a stimulant for physical endurance, kratom holds a place in Malaysian folk medicine, where its leaves have been traditionally employed to address a range of ailments. These include treating diarrhea, fever, asthma, cough, pain, and stomach issues, as well as for deworming and to prolong sexual intercourse. Notably, kratom has also been historically utilized as a substitute for opium or as an aid in managing opioid withdrawal symptoms. This dualistic traditional application—serving both as a stimulant for labor and as an analgesic or opioid substitute—underscores the complex pharmacological profile of kratom. This historical context is vital for understanding how its modern applications are perceived in terms of ""effectiveness,"" as the desired outcome heavily influences the choice of form and dosage. The capacity of kratom to produce both invigorating and sedating effects, depending on the dose, is a fundamental aspect that shapes discussions around its utility and potential risks.  

**1.2. Key Active Alkaloids: Mitragynine and 7-Hydroxymitragynine**

The primary psychoactive compounds responsible for kratom's effects are the indole alkaloids mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH). Mitragynine is the most abundant alkaloid found in the leaves of *Mitragyna speciosa*. Chemically, mitragynine is characterized by its insolubility in water but solubility in conventional organic solvents such as acetone, acetic acid, alcohols, chloroform, and diethyl ether.  

The water insolubility of mitragynine carries significant implications for the efficacy of kratom preparations, particularly traditional tea. When leaves are steeped in hot water to make tea, the primary alkaloid, mitragynine, may not be efficiently extracted into the aqueous solution compared to methods that utilize organic solvents or produce concentrated extracts. This inherent chemical property suggests a potential difference in the overall alkaloid profile and, consequently, the perceived ""effectiveness"" of tea preparations compared to other forms. While tea has a long history of use, the actual amount of mitragynine delivered through traditional brewing methods might be lower than expected, potentially leading to a milder experience or requiring larger quantities of leaf material to achieve desired effects. This highlights how the chemical properties of the active compounds directly influence the practical utility and comparative potency of different kratom forms.  

**1.3. Regulatory Status and Safety Warnings**

It is imperative to acknowledge the critical regulatory landscape surrounding kratom. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has explicitly stated that there are no approved uses for kratom products and has issued strong advisories against their use due to significant safety risks. These risks include, but are not limited to, addiction, abuse, dependence, and in some reported cases, fatal outcomes. The FDA has also initiated mandatory recalls of kratom-containing products, such as those associated with Triangle Pharmanaturals, LLC, in 2018.  

A significant challenge in assessing the ""effectiveness"" and safety of kratom across its various forms stems from the largely unregulated nature of the market, particularly in the United States. This lack of oversight means that consumers have no guarantee regarding the quality, purity, or actual potency of kratom products. Products may be contaminated with heavy metals like lead, adulterated with other drugs, or contain inaccurate statements about their alkaloid content. This inconsistent product quality directly compromises the concept of reliable ""effectiveness"" for any form. Without standardization and rigorous quality control, users cannot consistently predict the dosage or purity of what they are consuming, rendering any discussion of comparative effectiveness inherently speculative and risky. The legal status of kratom is also in flux; while federally legal in the U.S., it is banned, regulated, or age-restricted in numerous states and various countries globally. This fragmented regulatory environment further complicates informed decision-making and underscores the critical overarching risk factor associated with all kratom products currently available on the market.  

**2. Pharmacological Basis of Kratom's Effects**

**2.1. Mechanism of Action and Dose-Dependent Effects**

The pharmacological actions of kratom are primarily attributed to its key active alkaloids, mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine. These compounds interact with various receptors in the brain, notably the mu-opioid receptors (MOR). The effects of kratom are profoundly dose-dependent, exhibiting a biphasic pharmacological profile.  

At lower doses, typically ranging from 1 to 5 grams, kratom generally acts as a stimulant. Users often report increased energy, heightened alertness, and enhanced sociability. This stimulant effect is traditionally utilized to combat fatigue and improve work capacity during long working hours. Conversely, at higher doses, generally between 5 and 15 grams, kratom exhibits sedative-narcotic effects. These effects are comparable to those of opioid pain relievers like morphine and codeine, inducing feelings of calmness, euphoria, pain relief, and a dreamlike state. Very high doses, exceeding 15 grams, can lead to significantly amplified sedation and potentially even loss of consciousness.  

This dose-dependent biphasic effect is a cornerstone of kratom's pharmacology. It means that the ""effectiveness"" of kratom is not a singular, inherent quality but is critically tied to the specific dosage within each form and the desired physiological outcome. For instance, a form and dose considered ""effective"" for promoting energy and alertness would be entirely different from one sought for pain relief or sedation. This necessitates a nuanced understanding of user intent when discussing effectiveness; a form that is effective for one purpose might be ineffective or even counterproductive if the dosage is misaligned with the user's goals.

**2.2. The Critical Role of 7-Hydroxymitragynine (7-OH)**

The pharmacological profile of kratom is significantly influenced by the metabolic conversion of mitragynine to 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH). This conversion primarily occurs through metabolic processes mediated by cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) isoforms, such as CYP3A4, within the liver. Research indicates that 7-OH is a crucial active metabolite, and strong evidence suggests it is the primary mediator of mitragynine's analgesic effects. While mitragynine itself possesses some opioid agonist activity, its pain-relieving effects are largely dependent on its transformation into 7-OH.  

A key aspect of 7-OH's significance is its considerably higher potency. It is approximately 10-fold more potent as a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist at the human μ-opioid receptor (hMOR) compared to mitragynine. In animal models, 7-OH demonstrated about fivefold greater analgesic potency than orally administered mitragynine. This high potency means that even relatively small quantities of 7-OH, formed *in vivo* as a metabolite, can substantially contribute to kratom's overall analgesic activity. Furthermore, 7-OH has been shown to penetrate the brain, where it exerts its effects.  

The metabolic conversion of mitragynine to the highly potent 7-OH is a critical determinant of kratom's perceived ""effectiveness,"" particularly for achieving opioid-like effects such as pain relief. Forms of kratom that either naturally contain higher levels of pre-formed 7-OH or those whose processing methods lead to an increase in 7-OH (such as extracts) may be perceived as more ""effective"" for these specific outcomes. This inherent chemical enhancement provides a clear pharmacological basis for differences in potency across forms. Additionally, the reliance on CYP3A enzymes for this conversion introduces an element of inter-individual variability; differences in metabolic rates among users can influence the amount of 7-OH produced, thereby affecting the consistency of observed effects and the overall ""effectiveness"" for different individuals. This complex metabolic pathway underscores why a simple comparison of ""effectiveness"" between forms is insufficient without considering the specific chemical transformations occurring within the body.  

**2.3. Bioavailability Considerations**

Bioavailability refers to the proportion of a substance that enters the circulation when introduced into the body and is thus able to have an active effect. For mitragynine, the principal alkaloid in kratom, oral consumption results in relatively low absorption, estimated at approximately 20% or 30%. In stark contrast, intravenous administration achieves complete bioavailability.  

This relatively low oral bioavailability of mitragynine signifies that a substantial portion of the active compound ingested is not absorbed into the systemic circulation and, therefore, does not become available to exert its effects. This has direct implications for the ""effectiveness"" of all orally consumed kratom forms. It means that to achieve a desired effect, higher doses are generally required for oral forms compared to a hypothetical scenario of complete absorption. Furthermore, factors influencing absorption, such as the presence of food in the stomach or the physical form of the kratom product, will directly impact the actual amount of active alkaloids that reach the bloodstream. For instance, taking kratom on an empty stomach may lead to faster absorption, while consumption with food can slow down digestion and metabolism. The body's ability to utilize the active compounds is inherently limited by this absorption rate, meaning that even a highly concentrated form will only deliver a fraction of its total alkaloid content to the target receptors. This underscores that ""effectiveness"" is not solely about the concentration of alkaloids in a product but also about how efficiently those compounds can be absorbed and metabolized by the body.

**3. Detailed Analysis of Kratom Forms**

Kratom is available in various forms, each presenting distinct characteristics that influence its absorption, onset, duration, potency, and user experience. Understanding these differences is crucial for comprehending their relative ""effectiveness"" for different purposes.

**3.1. Kratom Powder**

Kratom powder is arguably the most common and traditional form available, consisting of crushed or finely milled dried leaves. Its color typically ranges from light to dark green, reflecting the natural plant material. This form offers versatility in preparation; it can be mixed directly into beverages like water or juice, blended with food, or simply ingested via the ""toss and wash"" method.  

Regarding absorption and onset, kratom powder generally takes longer to absorb and metabolize compared to extracts, as the body must first digest the raw plant material. However, some sources suggest that finely milled powders, particularly certain strains like White Maeng Da, are prepared for ""rapid absorption,"" which may imply a faster onset relative to coarser powders or whole leaves. Despite this, the full digestion process means that the initial stimulant effects at low doses are typically felt within 10 minutes, lasting approximately 1 to 1.5 hours. For higher, sedative doses, the effects can extend up to 6 hours. The duration of effects for powder is generally longer and more gradual compared to extracts, providing a steady experience as the active compounds are released over time during digestion. Typical starting dosages for powder range from 2 to 3 grams, with low doses (1-2g) often associated with energy and alertness, moderate doses (2-4g) supporting motivation and mood, and higher doses (4g+) leading to more relaxing or sedating effects. The advantages of kratom powder include its customizability in dosing, retention of the full natural alkaloid content, and generally lower cost compared to concentrated extracts. The primary drawback is the required preparation time and a slower onset of effects compared to more refined forms. The variability in absorption speed, even within the powder form, depending on the fineness of the grind or specific strain, highlights that the *quality* and processing of the powder itself can significantly influence its perceived ""effectiveness"" and how quickly effects manifest.  

**3.2. Kratom Capsules**

Kratom capsules offer a highly convenient and discreet method of consumption, containing pre-measured servings of powdered kratom. This format eliminates the need for measuring loose powder and masks the characteristic bitter taste of kratom, making it appealing to many users.  

Similar to loose powder, capsules require digestion of both the capsule shell and the encapsulated plant material before the active compounds can be absorbed into the bloodstream. This digestive step typically results in a slower absorption profile compared to liquid forms or extracts. Reported onset times for capsules vary, with some sources indicating effects within 5 to 15 minutes and others around 10 minutes. The duration of effects also shows variability, with reports ranging from 60 to 90 minutes to 2 to 5 hours. Certain encapsulated strains are noted for a ""slow onset with a steady energy plateau,"" suggesting a more prolonged and consistent effect profile. The pre-measured nature of capsules contributes to more consistent dosing, which can be beneficial for users seeking predictable effects. The main advantages of capsules are their unparalleled convenience, portability, and the precise, consistent dosing they offer, along with the avoidance of kratom's bitter taste. However, their absorption and onset can be slower than extracts, and they are generally more expensive per gram than bulk powder. The observed variability in reported duration for capsules across different sources underscores that factors beyond the form itself, such as individual metabolism, specific dosage, and potentially the kratom strain, significantly influence the overall experience. This makes precise prediction of the duration of ""effectiveness"" challenging for individual users, despite the convenience of the encapsulated format.  

**3.3. Kratom Extracts**

Kratom extracts represent a highly concentrated form of kratom, engineered to deliver a greater potency of active alkaloids in a smaller serving size. The extraction process involves pulling out the active compounds, primarily mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, from the raw plant material, often by boiling down aqueous suspensions of the leaves to create a more potent product. These extracts are available in various formats, including stable pastes, dark brown resins, tinctures, liquid shots, gummies, and softgels.  

A defining characteristic of extracts is their significantly higher alkaloid content compared to raw powder, particularly in terms of 7-hydroxymitragynine. The extraction process itself can enhance 7-OH levels, as mitragynine can partially convert into 7-OH during the boiling-down phase. Some extracts may even be standardized to contain a specific percentage of mitragynine and/or 7-OH, offering a degree of consistency in potency (e.g., a 2% mitragynine extract contains 0.02g of mitragynine per 1g of extract). Due to their concentrated nature, extracts absorb faster into the body because the active compounds are already separated from the bulky plant material, leading to a quicker onset of effects. Onset times are typically reported within 5 to 10 minutes. The duration of effects generally ranges from 2 to 5 hours , though some sources suggest that traditional powders might offer a longer-lasting experience compared to extracts. Given their high concentration, extracts require much smaller serving sizes; for instance, a liquid extract might only require 1-2 drops compared to 3-5 grams of powder. Beginners are advised to start with very low doses due to the inherent strength of these products.  

The advantages of extracts include stronger effects, faster onset, smaller serving sizes, and convenient consumption methods like liquid shots or gummies. However, they are typically more expensive than powder and carry a higher risk of overconsumption due to their potency. Some sources also suggest that due to their higher potency, extracts may remain in the body longer. The elevated concentration of 7-hydroxymitragynine in extracts, often a result of the processing itself, is a critical factor influencing their ""effectiveness,"" particularly for analgesic effects. Given that 7-OH is the primary mediator of pain relief and is significantly more potent at opioid receptors , extracts are chemically designed to be more ""effective"" for such outcomes. This direct chemical pathway to enhanced potency makes extracts a distinct and potentially more impactful category, though this also inherently increases the risks associated with their use, including a higher potential for dependence and adverse effects.

**3.4. Kratom Tea**

Kratom tea is a traditional method of consumption, prepared by brewing fresh or dried kratom leaves in hot water. The preparation typically involves steeping loose-leaf kratom for 15 to 20 minutes. To mask the bitter taste, users often add sugar, honey, or lemon juice; notably, lemon juice may also facilitate the extraction of alkaloids.  

As a liquid form, kratom tea is absorbed faster than powder or capsules because the active compounds are already dissolved or suspended, bypassing the initial digestion of solid plant material. Effects are generally felt within 10 to 15 minutes of ingestion. The duration of effects for tea is dose-dependent: lower doses (1-5g) typically produce stimulant effects lasting up to 2 hours, while higher doses (7-8g) can induce sedative effects that may last up to 8 hours, with peak effects occurring between 1.5 to 2.5 hours after consumption. The dosage for tea varies significantly based on the amount of leaves used and the steeping time.  

The primary advantages of kratom tea include its traditional appeal, a perception of being more ""natural"" and less like taking a substance, and its faster absorption rate compared to solid forms. However, the bitter taste can be a deterrent, and it requires preparation time. A significant consideration for tea's ""effectiveness"" is the water insolubility of mitragynine, the most abundant alkaloid. This chemical property suggests that traditional tea brewing may not efficiently extract the full profile of primary alkaloids compared to methods that use organic solvents or produce concentrated extracts. While 7-OH and other alkaloids may still be present and contribute to effects, the overall potency derived from mitragynine might be lower than expected, despite the faster absorption. This implies that traditional tea might offer a different, potentially milder, experience compared to other forms, highlighting a potential mismatch between traditional preparation methods and the full pharmacological potential of the plant's compounds. Furthermore, tea may leave the system sooner compared to other forms.

**4. Comparative Effectiveness: A Multi-Factorial Perspective**

Assessing the ""effectiveness"" of different kratom forms is a complex endeavor, as it is not a singular metric but rather a function of multiple interacting factors, including desired effects, pharmacokinetic properties, and product characteristics.

**4.1. Comparative Table of Kratom Forms**

The following table provides a concise comparison of the key differentiating factors across powder, capsules, extracts, and tea, offering a direct, at-a-glance overview of their respective profiles.

|| || |**Feature**|**Kratom Powder**|**Kratom Capsules**|**Kratom Extracts**|**Kratom Tea**| |**Typical Onset**|10-15 minutes (stimulant effects)|5-15 minutes|5-10 minutes (fastest)|10-15 minutes| |**Typical Duration**|1-1.5 hours (stimulant), up to 6 hours (sedative) ; longer-lasting than extracts|2-5 hours ; 60-90 minutes ; can be steady/prolonged|2-5 hours ; potentially shorter than powder|Up to 2 hours (low dose), up to 8 hours (high dose)| |**Relative Potency**|Standard/Natural alkaloid content|Standard/Natural alkaloid content|High/Concentrated (elevated 7-OH)|Variable (mitragynine water insolubility)| |**Convenience**|Low (requires preparation)|High (pre-measured, portable)|High (small serving, various forms)|Medium (requires preparation)| |**Key Characteristics**|Full plant material, custom dosage|Encapsulated powder, no bitter taste|Concentrated alkaloids, higher 7-OH|Traditional, perceived as natural|

 

**4.2. Bioavailability and Absorption Rates Across Forms**

The oral absorption of mitragynine, the primary active alkaloid, is relatively low, estimated at only 20-30%. This inherent limitation means that a significant portion of the active compounds ingested is not absorbed into the bloodstream, irrespective of the form. This has profound implications for the perceived ""effectiveness"" of any kratom product, as a substantial amount of the active substance is simply not utilized by the body.  

The physical form of kratom directly influences the speed at which its active compounds are absorbed. Forms that require the body to digest solid plant material, such as powders and capsules, generally exhibit a slower absorption profile. This is because the active alkaloids must first be released from the plant matrix and then absorbed through the digestive system. In contrast, forms where the alkaloids are already extracted or are in a liquid state, such as extracts and tea, allow for faster absorption. This quicker entry into the bloodstream contributes to a more rapid onset of effects. Therefore, the perceived ""effectiveness"" in terms of how quickly effects are felt is directly tied to the physical form and its impact on the absorption rate. The overall effectiveness is a delicate balance between the concentration of active compounds in the product, the speed of their absorption, and the body's metabolic efficiency in converting mitragynine to the more potent 7-hydroxymitragynine.  

**4.3. How Desired Effects Influence Form Choice**

The concept of ""effectiveness"" for kratom is highly subjective and fundamentally depends on the user's specific desired outcome. There is no single form that is universally ""most effective""; rather, each form offers a distinct pharmacokinetic profile that aligns with different user needs and preferences.

For individuals seeking rapid and potent effects, particularly for strong pain relief or a pronounced opioid-like experience, extracts might be the preferred choice. Their higher concentration of alkaloids, especially the potent 7-hydroxymitragynine, combined with a faster onset, makes them suitable for quick impact. Conversely, for those desiring more sustained, gradual effects—such as prolonged energy, mild mood support, or a steady sense of calm—powder or capsules might be chosen. These forms, due to their slower digestion and release of active compounds, tend to offer a longer duration of action. For users prioritizing convenience, discretion, and precise, consistent dosing, capsules are often favored, as they eliminate the need for measuring loose powder and are easy to transport. Lastly, for individuals who value traditional consumption methods or seek a perceived ""natural"" experience, tea is often selected, despite the potential variability in alkaloid extraction efficiency. This multi-faceted perspective highlights that ""effectiveness"" is not a simple linear scale but a complex interplay of pharmacokinetic properties and specific physiological outcomes. Each form is more suitable for a particular, often risky, application rather than being universally superior.  

**4.4. The Impact of Concentration and 7-Hydroxymitragynine Levels on Perceived ""Effectiveness""**

The concentration of active alkaloids, particularly 7-hydroxymitragynine (7-OH), plays a pivotal role in the perceived ""effectiveness"" of different kratom forms. Extracts are specifically designed for a higher concentration of alkaloids, and importantly, the extraction process itself can lead to elevated levels of 7-OH. This is significant because 7-OH is recognized as the primary mediator of kratom's analgesic effects and is significantly more potent than mitragynine at mu-opioid receptors.  

The higher 7-OH content in extracts means that a much smaller serving size can achieve stronger effects, leading to a perception of significantly higher ""effectiveness"" for certain outcomes, particularly pain relief or pronounced sedative effects. This provides a strong pharmacological basis for why extracts are often considered more potent and impactful for opioid-like effects. The chemical process involved in creating extracts directly enhances the presence of the most potent compound, making extracts a distinct category in terms of pharmacological impact. Furthermore, while extracts deliver pre-concentrated 7-OH, the body's own metabolism also plays a crucial role in generating this potent compound from mitragynine in other forms like powder or tea. Therefore, the ultimate ""effectiveness"" is a combination of the initial alkaloid profile of the product and the individual's metabolic capacity to convert mitragynine into the highly active 7-OH. This intricate relationship between form, concentration, and metabolic conversion underscores the complexity of predicting and achieving desired effects, especially given the lack of regulation and standardization in the market.  

**5. Safety Profile, Risks, and Responsible Use Considerations**

Despite the various forms and perceived ""effectiveness"" of kratom, it is critical to emphasize the significant safety concerns and risks associated with its use.

**5.1. Common Adverse Reactions and Potential for Severe Side Effects**

Kratom use is linked to a range of adverse reactions, from common discomforts to severe and potentially life-threatening conditions. Common side effects include sensitivity to sunlight, nausea, itching, sweating, dry mouth, constipation, increased urination, and loss of appetite. More concerning neuropsychiatric symptoms, such as psychotic episodes, hallucinations, delusion, confusion, agitation, tremors, and seizures, have been reported. Cardiovascular symptoms, including hypertension (high blood pressure) and tachycardia (fast heart rate), can also occur.  

Long-term use, particularly at high doses, is associated with a more severe spectrum of adverse effects. These include anorexia, significant weight loss, insomnia, skin darkening, tremors, and polyuria. In some cases, high-dose, long-term use has led to hallucinations and paranoia. Furthermore, cases of intrahepatic cholestasis, a form of liver injury, have been reported. A particularly grave risk arises when kratom is consumed in combination with other substances, especially central nervous system (CNS) depressants. Serious and even fatal adverse effects have been documented in such instances. This extensive list of adverse effects, ranging from mild to severe and potentially fatal, significantly outweighs any perceived ""effectiveness"" for self-treatment. The inherent danger of combining kratom with other drugs is a critical public health concern, especially given its proposed use for managing opioid withdrawal symptoms, where individuals may be concurrently using other substances.  

**5.2. Addiction, Dependence, and Withdrawal Symptoms**

Kratom carries significant risks of addiction, abuse, and dependence, which are critical considerations for any user. Regular use of kratom can lead to the development of physical and psychological dependence. When use is discontinued, individuals may experience a range of withdrawal symptoms, which, although typically diminishing within a week, can be distressing. These symptoms include intense craving for the substance, general weakness and lethargy, anxiety, restlessness, rhinorrhea (runny nose), myalgia (muscle pain), nausea, sweating, jerky movements of the limbs, tremors, sleep disturbances, and even hallucinations.  

The development of tolerance with long-term use is a common phenomenon, necessitating higher doses to achieve the same effects. This escalating dosage directly increases the risk of physical dependence and addiction. The clear evidence of addiction and dependence, coupled with the presence of withdrawal symptoms, underscores that kratom is not a benign ""natural alternative"" but rather a substance with drug-like properties and a significant potential for harm, regardless of the form consumed. This aspect is fundamental to understanding the overall safety profile and should be a primary consideration for anyone contemplating its use.  

**5.3. Risks of Product Adulteration, Contamination, and Inconsistent Potency**

A pervasive and critical safety concern across all kratom forms is the unregulated nature of its market in the United States. This lack of regulatory oversight means there is no guarantee of product quality, purity, or consistent potency. Without standardized manufacturing practices and independent verification, consumers are exposed to substantial risks.  

Kratom products have been found to be contaminated with various toxins, such as lead, or adulterated with other drugs, posing unforeseen health hazards. Furthermore, the alkaloid content, particularly of mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, can be highly variable and inaccurately labeled. This inconsistency in potency means that self-dosing, which is common among users, can lead to unpredictable effects, including accidental overconsumption or insufficient dosing for desired outcomes. The absence of reliable quality control fundamentally undermines any discussion of ""effectiveness"" and safety. Even if a particular form, such as an extract, is theoretically more potent, the actual product purchased by a consumer may not deliver that expected potency or, worse, could contain harmful contaminants. This makes reliable and safe use impossible, as users cannot make informed decisions about dosage or purity, leading to unpredictable effects or potential harm.  

**5.4. Importance of Consulting Healthcare Professionals**

Given the significant safety risks, the potential for addiction and adverse effects, and the largely unregulated market, it is unequivocally recommended that individuals consult with a qualified healthcare provider—such as a physician, nurse, or pharmacist—before considering the use of kratom in any form. This professional guidance is paramount to assess individual health conditions, potential drug interactions, and to understand the inherent risks.  

Users should never alter suggested doses or frequency of kratom consumption without prior consultation with their healthcare provider. Furthermore, if any concerning changes in health status occur while using kratom, immediate medical attention should be sought. This emphasis on professional medical oversight is a non-negotiable recommendation, stemming directly from the comprehensive analysis of kratom's pharmacology, its documented harms, and the current regulatory void.  

**6. Conclusion and Recommendations**

**6.1. Summary of Key Differences and Nuanced ""Effectiveness""**

The analysis of kratom forms—powder, capsules, extracts, and tea—reveals distinct differences primarily in their **potency, onset of effects, duration of action, and convenience of use**. Powder offers versatility and a more gradual, sustained experience, allowing for customizable dosages. Capsules prioritize convenience, portability, and precise dosing, making them a discreet option. Extracts stand out for their highest potency and fastest onset, particularly for analgesic effects, largely attributable to their concentrated alkaloid content, including elevated levels of 7-hydroxymitragynine. Tea provides a traditional, faster-absorbing liquid form, though its efficiency in extracting the primary alkaloid, mitragynine, may vary due to its water insolubility.

It is crucial to reiterate that ""effectiveness"" is not a singular, objective measure but is highly subjective and contingent upon the user's specific desired effects, whether stimulant or sedative. This effectiveness is further influenced by individual metabolic differences, particularly the body's capacity to convert mitragynine into the more potent 7-hydroxymitragynine. The detailed examination demonstrates that there is no single ""most effective"" form; instead, each form presents a unique pharmacokinetic profile that may be more suitable for specific, often risky, applications. The perceived utility of a form is therefore a complex interplay of its chemical composition, absorption characteristics, and the user's intended outcome.

**6.2. Recommendations for Extreme Caution and Informed Decision-Making**

Based on the comprehensive review of available data, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's strong warnings against kratom use due to significant safety risks—including addiction, severe adverse effects, and potential fatalities—cannot be overstated. The pervasive issue of an unregulated market exacerbates these dangers, as products frequently lack consistent quality, purity, and accurate potency labeling. This inherent unpredictability makes safe and predictable use of any kratom form virtually impossible.

Therefore, it is strongly advised against self-medication with kratom for any condition, including pain management or opioid withdrawal symptoms. The absence of robust clinical data supporting its efficacy for approved medical uses, coupled with the documented risks, necessitates this cautionary stance. Consumers should be acutely aware that relying on unregulated kratom products exposes them to unknown concentrations of active compounds and potential contaminants, leading to unpredictable and potentially harmful outcomes.

**6.3. Call for Further Rigorous Scientific Research and Regulatory Oversight**

The current understanding of kratom's pharmacology, efficacy, and safety remains limited, particularly concerning its various forms and long-term effects. This knowledge gap, coupled with the significant public health concerns arising from an unregulated market, underscores an urgent need for comprehensive, well-controlled clinical studies. Such research is essential to fully elucidate kratom's mechanisms of action, establish safe and effective dosages (if any), and understand its full spectrum of potential benefits and harms.

Concurrently, the establishment of robust regulatory frameworks is imperative. These frameworks must ensure stringent product quality, standardization of alkaloid content, and consumer safety. Addressing the current market's significant shortcomings through rigorous regulation would provide a foundation for more reliable product information and, ultimately, mitigate the substantial risks currently faced by individuals who choose to use kratom. Without such measures, the inherent dangers associated with kratom use across all its forms will persist.

Felix splashed puke into the downstairs sink. Cameron stared at the contents. An odd, sunny-day breeze swirled around the basement 

“Are those…is this from Fall Creek?” he whispered.

They were. 

I hadn’t seen the cards from **The Sylvan Shore** in twenty years—but they still slithered through my dreams, gold-edged and mold-slick, every week since I was fifteen. 

I never even knew how the game ended, except that the body count was three and rising. 

I picked up the rubber-banded stack of cards. I went dizzy. The smoke and mold and water smell bloomed. Felix spasmed and dry-heaved. 

I waved cigarette smoke out of my eyes. *The odd warm breeze changed direction.* I didn’t understand where I was. 

*I was in a basement.*

Yes. It was today. Right before the funeral. 

*No.* 

It was twenty years ago. I could feel Verrett’s long yellow fingernails on my neck. 

# __________

It started a quarter mile from the State Fairgrounds. 

We turned off Keystone and into the cracked-up Fall Creek Water Plant under the faded sign that proclaimed:

**EVERYTHING THAT GROWS NEEDS WATER.**

We hustled through the padlocked bay door.

Scrambled down the stairwell past the locked fire door.

Slipped through the dead-bolted steel slab marked:

**BACKWASH CHAMBER SUB B1.**

The sub-basement reeked. Mold, chlorine, and chain-smoked cigarettes pervaded. 

*But here we were.* 

Felix yanked, shook, and cracked a beer from a cooler packed with ice, and said this was exactly what the fuck we needed. Verrett said congratulations were in order.

We clapped for Ricky—he’d really set the place up.

Ricky grinned bigtime as he helped Verrett with his coat. Verrett lifted his good shoulder as Ricky gently pulled the sleeve past the bad one. 

Verrett’s shirt got hung on the butt of a revolver. I must have been staring right at it, because Ricky winked at me and covered it with a flick of Verrett’s flannel shirt.

Verrett was our advanced math teacher. He wore these huge steel-rimmed glasses, and always had one hand tucked inside a pocket. Students would whisper he’d been in a mental institution. That he was fucking loaded. That he had a false hand, and he'd cut the old one off himself. 

Verrett understood us. He understood that everyone in our little group  only got the wrong kind of attention from adults. For most of us, he was the first male adult who wasn’t constantly shouting at us.

“Before he was in my class, Ricky couldn’t even factor a trinomial. Now look at him, setting up our critical event with personal grace. I’d clap, ah, if only I was able.” 

Ricky was all smiles as he rolled up a sticky joint.  He ran our Dungeons and Dragons games, his plots drip-filtered from weekly LSD swan-dives. 

Dominic and I passed the joint pinch-to-pinch, exhaling thick cones of cannabis indica smoke. A week ago Dom and I dyed our hair—Lunar Tides Eclipse Black—over his moms chipped kitchen sink. 

Ricky said we should be really excited. He said he played Verrett’s game just one time and it changed his whole life. All that was left for us to do was  playtest the final prototype. And in return, all the weed, beer, and Dungeons and Dragons we could stand. We were all virgins but Dominic, and it was heaven. 

“Credit?” Felix asked. “You said we get credit?”

“Each one of your names, in **Sylvan Shores Game Manual**, on the very first page.” Verrett said. 

“For what, exactly?” I asked. 

“For refining the game.”

“So we’re just…unpaid labor?” Dominic asked. 

“On my teacher’s salary, this…is the best I can do.”

Dominic rolled his eyes. “So you’ll be the designer, writer, person who gets all the credit and money?”

“No.” Verrett laughed. His breath stank like coffee and mold. “Just the Translator.”

“Ricky said you invented it. What, did you and Ricky discover it on some acid trip?” Dylan giggled. 

“No. Oh, no.” Verrett said, tapping the front of his skull. “I just translated as it was spoken to me and the rules were placed into my head one-by-one.”

Everyone eyeballed each other. *Is this shit for real?* 

“By who?” Dominic scoffed

Verrett sighed, closed his eyes. He leaned back and sighed. “*The* ***Goddess.***”

Some of the other guys laughed. 

I didn’t. 

A fist of ice squeezed my stomach as I thought about Verrett, the gun, and those three locked doors. 

# __________

This was how the game started. 

This is how every tick of the clock for twenty years was another turn, until Dylan waved the flag when he hanged himself next to his Toyota Camry. 

See, Verrett worked for the water company. Indianapolis needed an expert on pipes, flow, and pressure. So, you get Julian Verrett.

That’s how he had his accident. That’s how he saw the **Goddess**. 

His memory of it was just two distinct noises. Angry groaning from the lathe as it snatched his cuff, then one wet snap as his arm shattered, and his shoulder pried out of socket.

Verrett said the lathe whipped all the clothes off. He was cold and naked as his head slammed over and over against the hard metal saddle of the machine.

By the time most of his teeth were gone, and he was blind from his own foamy blood, well, that was when he finally met the **Goddess**. 

“She reached down, with one slender hand, from above the bubbling red death and clicked off the machine.”

He looked us each in the eye and reached a short, shaking arm out. “I could have never reached that button on my own, boys.”

He said the **Goddess** saved him with one hand, and placed a vision into his mind with the other. 

They scraped what was left of him off the lathe and got him to Methodist Hospital with twenty-two fractures, a cranium fracture, and one arm that would be little more than dead weight at best.

He said the game could pierce the inexplicable veil and that he, Julian Verrett, would be the one to bring the truth of the **Goddess** across this chasm.. 

He shuffled the cards *plk-plk-plk*. 

“Each one of us has the same odds. Every card is a moment in life moving forward from this point in time. Every play, a lifetime in miniature. You put your will to the test and win, or succumb, to the whims of the **Goddess**. Time to experience your future.” 

Pretty cards. Black White Gold Blue Red. Their names glinted and tantalized. **The Twilight Bay**. **The Question of Seashells**. **Dashed against the Rocks**.

A strong, warm wind blew through the chamber. Verrett gasped as they freckled the dingy floor.

 I picked one up - **The Undertow**. Gold fingers grasping just above the waves grasping for something already gone, catching only an ocean breeze. 

“Jesus, this looks unpleasant.” I said. 

Ricky lit a joint. “Tell em, Julian.”

“Some take all. Some give all. Only one card wins.”

“What does this one…do?” Dylan said, poking the edges of “**Dashed against the Rocks**”. He traced a woodcut image of a man battered, his body painting jagged rocks crimson as the seafoam below curled pink. 

“Instant death.” Ricky said. “*The player is removed from the game. No further turns are taken.*”

Julian cleared the table off. He unfolded a thick black game board in front of us, thin slots sunk to stand the cards up nicely. 

“But it has already been proven before I even start.” Julian began stacking out piles 1-2-3-4-5 for each of us. 

“Each card is destiny, sure as the tide. What will happen, has happened, and is always happening. But only I will arrive at the Sylvan Shore.”

Dom rolled his eyes and scoffed. He couldn’t possibly be sold. 

Verrett used his good hand to lift the gun from its holster. The room got so quiet all you could hear was the cigarette paper smoldering. 

“If anyone thinks they can stop what has started. ” Verrett said. 

“Bullshit.” Said Dominic, as Verrett moved the gun less than a foot from his face. 

“First turn. See what the **Goddess** has chosen for you.”

“Are you going to kill me, what if the game says I win?”

Verrett tapped out Dominic’s cards.

“Dominic, let’s find out.”

“They don’t mean anything.”

“Oh, they certainly do. You’ll see exactly what the **Goddess** has in store for each of us.”

“It’s a toy.”

Verrett raged. “Pick it up! The **Goddess** demands it!”

Dominic pursed his lips. He picked the top card off his pile. With a glance, he went pfffft, and flicked the card over his shoulder. 

Ricky leaned to catch a glance of it. “Uh oh.”

Verrett didn’t take his eyes off Dom. He asked what the card was.

“**Dashed against the Rocks**.” Ricky said. 

Verrett pulled the trigger an inch away. Long dark strands of his hair smoldered onto the game board. His head made a terrible sizzling noise as he tilted straight back. 

Verrett slid the barrel of the gun across our faces and shouted that we better stop crying. 

He told Ricky to clean up the mess. The odd warm breeze started up again as Ricky yanked Dom’s jacket up past his shoulder. 

Verrett stared right down the gun barrel. I tried to shout, but only dry yelps escaped. 

Verrett tugged a tight knot across Dom’s soaked head, jamming the denim deep into the hole in his forehead. 

Ricky grunted and shoved Dominic’s body over the rails and into the huge backwash pool beneath us. We watched the gray water grind away and churn red before the ringing in our ears stopped. 

Verrett said in a merry tone that it was my turn at the card. 

I froze, cell by dreadful cell. I remember wishing Verrett would push the barrel into my hair and pull the trigger. End this now. I’ll take my chances with the inconceivable. 

But this suffering was Verrett’s plan. 

In phone-jammed subfloors beneath the city, he held a smoking gun and the only keys to daylight.

We were going to play this game until we were dead or insane.

One turn at a time.

**Chapter 22: Yes, Me — Er... Allegedly**

 

As the ice lady’s friends turned their heads away and giggled, her own expression was one of apologetically controlling her humor. “Yes, sir, you are. Red-handed. But that’s alright! You aren’t the first newbie caught in the headlights here.”

“Gotta be the oldest, though,” one of her friends blurted. The other gasped shyly at her audacity, while the ice lady gave her a ‘look’ with her brows raised and her chin down.

“No doubts there,” Jack replied, shrugging. “Alright, moving on, uh… I’ll take a milkshake. Vanilla- no, Caramel. Yeah. Medium.”

“I could do a blend? Add a real caramel swirl? I can’t recommend adding an infusion. Not right for these flavors.”

“Oh, no way. No jet fuel in this puppy. Hmm. Yeah, let’s go with the rest of what you said, though.”

“Would you like me to utilize my powers or have it done by my folks in the back there? Actually, just my dad at the moment. Shouldn’t change much, just some added entertainment while I’m around.”

Jack glanced, noticing an opening where a middle-aged man with a puffy mustache and a white cap on his head was watching with a grin. He gave a thumbs up. Jack returned the gesture, then turned back to the ice lady. “Being a *newbie*, I can’t pass up a powers demonstration. Go ahead.”

“Coming right up!” She gestured with a hand out toward the alcove, where her presumed father had swiftly moved out of the way. Multiple streams of liquid flowed in wavy lines and formed into a little combined sphere in the air. She conventionally grabbed a fancy transparent cup and set it down, the sphere falling into it and mixing. A vague, cool breeze of sorts could be felt as the liquid swirled and changed consistency in a span of moments.

She set the milkshake in front of him without a top and stuck a hard straw in it. It was overall quite aesthetic, soft semi-liquid with a discernible swirl of caramel going around, something unlikely to be possible conventionally. An imprint of ‘Frosties!’ with icicle patterns was carved into one side of the glass. Despite that he could subtly tell the material wasn’t quite glass, it was made to look like some faux crystalline ice structure.

Smiling widely, the ice lady declared, “There you go, sir! Please utilize the drop box in the wall to the left of the counter for the cup and straw. They’re a specialty plant-based polymer, biodegradable for no microplastic intake. You can also purchase it if you prefer. They are permanent and sturdy.”

“Sure, why not? A memento. What do I owe you?” He glanced over to his right to see if the girls were still snickering and such at him, but they had left.

“The cup and straw are twenty bennies total. The shake is already logged as the ‘drink’ portion of your lunch credit. Unless, of course, you need a refund. Try it and make sure you like it, would you?”

Jack picked it up and took a sip, then quickly nodded appreciatively. “Charge me, lady. It’s delicious.”

“Alright. Thank you for your purchase! I’m Permafrost, by the way.”

“Ooh! Nice one.” An approval for the purchase flashed across Jack’s vision, and he checked through it immediately. “I’m Jack. Just Jack.”

She studied him with a grin. “For now, anyway. That’ll change. And thank you! It was kind of obvious. Probably unavoidable. I’m pretty difficult to get rid of.”

“Hmm.” Jack sipped his irresistible shake and squinted at her. “Almost indestructible? Regeneration type stuff?”

“Oh, this sculpture?” She struck a subtle but queenly pose briefly. “No, it’s very fragile! And very *expendable*. I guess that’s the trade-off. It’s more like a prettier, ice-based gun drone I pilot while I’m *chilling out* elsewhere. I’m a hyper-focused Summoner. Lucky mutation because I can pilot from a good range away. Unfortunately, it’s a bit of a *glass cannon*.”

Jack nodded slowly as he sipped. “*Cool*.” After a pause, looking at each other, they shared a smile.

“Always glad for people that understand the necessity to make puns when you’re an ice power user. *I don’t have a choice!*”

Jack shook his head with a helpless shrug. “Of course not. That’s just the reality. Anyway, sorry about gawking earlier. Didn’t mean to be rude.”

“It’s not a big deal. I don’t really look like this — it’s like an avatar. I designed it for stylish recognition because I aspire to be a public hero. I’m already a front-liner due to my expendability.” She paused, her gaze shifting away. “Well, let’s just say I’ve seen enough to want to be as much of an inspiration as I can for those who *actually* risk their life, and especially for *why* they do, which is all the people here. New Babylon and the territories of humanity.”

Jack nodded in understanding. “As a newbie, it’s good to hear such idealism survives the front lines. Thank you for doing it. For being there for the rest of us.”

She smiled, perhaps a touch wryly. “Relatively speaking, anyway. Whatever our job is, we should embrace it enthusiastically. Especially when we’re so well compensated.”

“I was curious why you’re doing *this*, on that same subject. Ice cream and such.”

“Oh. Well…” Permafrost glanced behind her, where the guy from before could just be seen, his back turned as he replaced stock in a mini-fridge. She then leaned forward and whispered, “My folks are especially enthusiastic for me, let’s say? They needed some *channel* to be involved, and they ran something similar back home. I don’t think my dad even understands the word ‘retirement.’ Anyway, I’m not *around* a lot, so this is a semi-special appearance. It has numerous benefits and — honestly — is pretty fun.”

Jack grinned. “And you get to spend time with your folks, who like to stay busy.”

She looked a bit sheepish as she flipped her head side-to-side in grudging ‘maybeness.’ “Even when he *doesn’t need it*, there’s nothing my dad likes more than me making him money.” Despite the words, it held that special brand of familial familiarity — threads of happiness within the teasing exasperation.

Jack loved seeing such things. Looked for it and envied it a bit. His own familiarity and ensuing memory tickled and finally bubbled up. Suddenly, he snapped his fingers and pointed. “Frost Top! Tomatotown, Enkidu District! Mister, Mister, uh, uh” — he kept snapping his fingers until he got it — “Billswan! Used to have a big beard.”

Permafrost’s eyes bugged out. “Wha-? How?!”

It piqued her dad’s interest, his head shooting up and him soon wheeling around to poke his head through the inner window, staring at Jack and squinting his eyes. “What’s that I’m hearing, a fellow Tomato?! What’s your name, son?”

“Not a Tomato, sir. Edenite, originally. My dad took me to your establishment many times. Never a trip between the city and Eden without stopping there. I had ice cream and he had the same thing every time: a root beer float. Jack Laker is the name.”

Mr. Billswan slapped the counter. “Blow me off the Plats, little Jack Laker?! Freddie’s son?!”

Grinning, Jack nodded. Then he hesitated. “Er, allegedly. Not sure my identity-”

“Ha ha *ha*!” Mr. Billswan burst into hearty, joyous laughter as he also burst through a swinging door, hopped the counter with amazing smoothness for his significant size, and shortly threw his arms out and embraced Jack firmly, laughing all the while. The general power of the act was such that Jack was glad for his recently improved toughness.

Permafrost stared on, mouth hanging open, perhaps just a little bit mortified.

Internally, Mini-Mem clarified, ***<Chance recognition within our ability to contain is not an issue, Jack. Most will surmise something strange occurred with you to get powers so late. They simply aren’t allowed to know how or why, for now. You can reference your life, though we’d prefer you keep it vague about the very recent history. Your general time and experience as a taxi pilot in recent years before the incident is fine to share, though.>***

*“Alright. Noted, thanks.”*

“What a sight for sore eyes!” Mr. Billswan broke from the hug, repeatedly clapping Jack on the back with a big grin. He was also suddenly shaken with a big hand on his shoulder. “Haha, look at *this*, Snowcake! He’s all grown up!”

Permafrost glared at her dad. “I told you to *never* use that nickname in-”

“You brought him his sundaes when you were a wee little thing,” Mr. Billswan interrupted smoothly with his unwavering cheer, apparently oblivious to his daughter’s ire. “A time or two anyway. Or was it ice cream cones?”

“Both,” Jack answered, smiling politely as he awkwardly patted the big guy’s shoulder in return. “Unlike my dad, I didn’t always get the same thing.” He was eying Permafrost, trying to recollect her younger self. Once again, he managed to summon it. “Aup! Now I remember. You dropped my ice cream cone once! You were totally inconsolable, bawling your eyes out on the floor, like you’d just *killed* someone.”

Mr. Billswan exclaimed, hand going to his forehead. “By Marduk’s Left Tit, I remember it! Half the damn restaurant tried to comfort her before I came sweeping in to the rescue!”

“ ‘I smushed it, daddy! I smushed the *icekweem* on the *fwooor*!’ ”

Her dad pointed at him in amazement at the sheer gold of his recall, and they both laughed uproariously.

Permafrost glared at them, though half in resignation. She huffed once and said, “Yes, I, too, am *thrilled* to ‘revisit’ this embarrassing childhood thing I don’t remember. In public.”

Her dad glanced over at her. “Oooh, hush now. It was adorable! My little girl can’t help but be adorable in everything she does or ever did. From a wee babe to today, it’s effortless.”

“Oh really? Including when I’m fighting with murderous invading hideous monsters? That’s adorable, still? Not that you’ll ever get to see it in the first place.”

Her dad frowned at her in concern.

Just then, another customer came up, smiling politely. “Hope I’m not interrupting too much…”

“Not at all, sir!” both Permafrost and her dad said with lightning-speed cheer, right on top of each other.

Mr. Billswan was quicker on the follow-up. “What’ll you have?! We've got any shake you can dream up, or take a look at our extensive menu!” He was back over the counter like a dance he’d performed a thousand times. He held a finger up emotively, grin wide under his big mustaches. “What’s more, my *amazing*, *beautiful* daughter can even construct it for you with her *Powers Most Cool* while you watch on!”

The young man blinked several times. “Right. Well, I was wondering if you can incorporate coffee and what the options are — I know it'll be extra if you have it…”

As Mr. Billswan regaled him with options, Jack moved off to the side and leaned over the counter to get Permafrost’s attention. “Hey, sorry about that. I got carried away. I’ve been remembering things *way* too well lately…”

Permafrost shook her head and offered him a polite smile. “It’s alright, Jack. It’s pretty ridiculous.” She snorted. “I just- I really talked like that? Ugh. Wow. Need Mom to break out the old videos and cringe at myself. Anyway, see you around. Good luck with training, rookie. Enjoy your cup — it’s dishwasher safe. And do come back and see us! Five percent off for cup owners!”

“You bet. Thanks. I will!”

Jack proceeded further down the circumference of the Great Ring of Food. Once he saw an automated station called *Slapped Between*, serving custom foot-long sandwiches, he couldn’t resist the sights or smells. He ordered up a double meat, double cheese Deluxe Ham & Chicken with the works, and watched robotic arms put it together and package it. A special Infused sauce was squirted on top. From a separate machine on the side, five types of baked chips were served, which would dump them on your tray. He went with plain and yet another Infused concoction as a dip. ‘Peppy Bean N’ Cheese.’

His shake balanced on his new tray, Jack found a seat and took it to eat. While devouring it all, he bounced around in his head about his imminent attribute choice. Augment, Interpret, Destroy, or Transmute. When he leveled up, he’d have to choose one of them again, and could thereby specialize in one if he wanted to.

He gravitated to Augment or Transmute as having the most apparent potential to start out with. Between the two, the former was maybe a bit more of a stable, even choice, the latter more of a gamble. Transmute was, all-in-all, more radical. Wanting some of both down the line was a given, but Lindsay had advised to choose carefully based on how he wanted to ‘steer’ the development of his powerset, as mutations were not set in stone nor entirely random.

On the surface, Augment was raw functionality and power — probably mainly defensively — and Transmute was versatility and utility. But the gamble was if Transmute happened to provide an option that did both at once. The biggest trouble for him was that he had no clue what any of it looked like. What did it actually mean in tangible reflection? Lindsay’s power could help with that. Ultimately, his final choice was better off punted to after his first training session and her full power utilization on him. Which came first, he wasn’t sure.

When he was done eating — down to pinching up crumbs — Mini-Mem chimed in. ***“As an incentive to ensure proper nutrition for a still-depleted body, you’ve been granted another free meal credit. Drink and food must be fully Infused rather than drizzled with it via sauces.”***

Jack shrugged. *“Okay. I can eat. You don’t have to tell me twice.”*

***“Technically, you*** *were* ***told twice. Lindsay first instructed it in your room.”***

*“Yeah, yeah… Big Sisters looking out for me. I’m eternally blessed by your loving concern.”*

***“Indeed.”***

*“I’m forever in debt to your priceless advice.”*

***“Correct.”***

*“You don’t have to agree every time I say these things, you know.”*

***“True.”***

Just as Jack was sighing longsufferingly, Lindsay sent a Mem-text: <I’m en route to mess.> Then he got a request to share his location coordinates with her.

He approved it and then sent a voice-link request, which she accepted. *“So,”* Jack began, *“I ate, but I was granted another Infusion-specific meal. Any advice?”*

*“You went light on the extra juice, didn’t you?”* she asked with an admonishing tone.

*“I guess? I got some thrown in with oil and a dip. Sandwich and chips from Slapped Between.”*

*“Boys and their sandwiches. I just don’t get it.”*

*“You don’t have to get it, Sister, just accept that you’re damned skippity I can’t resist a toasted foot-long served without a single living witness!”*

*“You wandered around to order? Yeesh, you need to get with the times, grandpa. Okay, whatever, but let me order for you this time, yeah?”* Another request came through for Lindsay to ‘arrange his lunch credit.’ He approved it.

*“Getting the ‘ole royal treatment again, hehe. A guy could get used to this!”*

*“Yes, I’m sure. I’ve eaten here half my life, though. I just use the interface. Speed of thought efficiency. Your order is already made and being prepped, boyo. Yours and mine will be droned over to the table.”*

*“Hot damn, we can do that?”*

*“Mm-hmm...”*

*“A girl who doesn’t like window shopping?”* Jack asked in mock incredulity, teasing her.

*“Not for my lunch, no. But I’ve been around that block enough. I prefer to have my lunches planned out a week in advance.”*

*“Of course you do.”*

*“Do you have a problem with that, Jack?”* The cool, subtle danger in her tone.

*“Not at all — I acknowledge that this is consistent with your character and fully accept you as the beautiful, unique human being that you are. Quirks and all.”*

*“Hmph. You better. Be there soon.”* She disconnected.

“Dodged another bullet, Jack!” Jack declared to no one as he fist-pumped. “Haha! Smoothest of the smooth confirmed.”

The drone arrived to set the food down just as Jack caught sight of Lindsay coming down the steps. The bag was labeled *‘Phonominal’* and the wonderful smell gave it away as, indeed, Pho. Pho and jet fuel. He started taking everything out, noting two bubble teas, one labeled ‘Energy Latte’ and another ‘Wintermelon Green Milk Tea,’ whatever the hell that was. It was clear whose was whose, though, so he set the milky, tapioca-pearled milk tea on her side.

Lindsay did a friendly wave as she took her seat, nodding at the paper container of food he was opening up. “There you go — lots of meat for a strapping young lad’s tastes, saturated also in heavy Infused elements. Drink all of that *actual beef broth*, too. Also, the latte is among the thickest of concentrations you’ll find. A pretty good staple to slurp up in between meals, by the way.”

“Yes ma’am,” Jack replied as he began prepping the soup, his mouth watering for it despite having just stuffed his face. *This new factory inside me is something else.* “Duly noted.”

As soon as Jack started eating, he was absorbed, feeling that special satiation once more. It was delicious, especially the meatballs. What they were made of, he didn’t know or care. He was feeling more ‘fueled,’ too. The drink especially had a kind of ‘kick’ to it, bestowing a noticeable energy spike.

Lindsay appeared no less hungry as she attacked the food, scarfing it down as if on a mission. Jack was still eating meat and noodles when Lindsay was at the ‘spooning up the broth’ stage.

A gaggle of laughter somewhat behind her made Lindsay look, and a small group of cadets could be seen crowded around the station Jack had been — *Frosties*. Apparently, Mr. Billswan or Permafrost had said something funny. Lindsay turned back and glanced at Jack’s ‘killed’ shake cup. “Got lured by that ice siren, huh?”

“I’m an easy mark, what can I say?” Jack replied after swallowing a bite. “She seems to have a pretty important powerset. I forgot to ask what club she was in.”

“Guess.”

“A fellow Linewalker, maybe?”

“Close. Nope. She’s a Mantle. Another group known for producing leaders, though they are way more likely to be the obvious faces and icons. Lots of tank types. Guardians, Bruisers.”

“Ironic considering a singer is considered one of the penultimate faces.”

“The truth is that any club can produce a leader. In fact, most of us will lead in some capacity eventually, being the most capable of elites. The randomness of powers ensures some who aren’t inclined or suited. The suitability isn’t always obvious… Memoria can see things in people the rest of us can’t. But those truly inclined for the subtleties of the background are much more likely to find themselves in clubs that celebrate that, so to speak. I certainly don’t talk about this or that leader to besmirch other kinds of potential. I’m from a club with plenty of unsung types myself. If we had nothing but archetypical Linewalkers and Mantles, we’d be completely fragged.”

“Right. I get you. Gotta have minions to boss around.” He grinned, showing it as a flippant comment.

Lindsay rolled her eyes as she sipped some broth off of her spoon. “People who execute commands, when those who make them see a bigger picture. Sometimes that executor makes a sacrifice to eat the ego of their own ideas, so as to suit the larger vision, though they themselves are much, much more than someone’s minion.”

“Preach that teamwork! No need for me to worry about that yet, though. I don’t even know what *I’m* doing, yet, much less others.”

Lindsay leaned on the table and thrust her spoon at him, giving him a stern look. “You do need to worry about it, Jack. You’ve spent most of your life piloting, fully in control of your solo vessel. Passengers and cargo, not teammates, and you preferred it, didn’t you? But you passed on the option to continue that because you want to grow and be all that you’re capable of. You’re on a multi-manned ship, now — a capital vessel. It’s bigger, it’s badder, but it’s more complicated in every way. Arguably, the biggest complexity is, quite simply, people. People who sometimes suck.”

Jack nodded slowly to this, as Lindsay emphasized each point with the spoon. He glanced at it after. “Food for thought.” He kept his face straight as he maintained rapt eye contact while cramming noodles in his mouth.

His tutor sighed, shook her head, and went back to sipping. He detected a bit of a smirk to her lips at one corner, at least. “My grade for you right now is: Hopeless. Fortunately, that’s a grade, so you *can* improve it.”

“Seems like that’s both our jobs, so I better.”

“Keep such sentiments up, and you’ll be well on your way to Hopeless Plus.”

“Oooh.” As they both continued scarfing down, Jack added, “I hope Extra Credit can include more eating.”

“Oh, you’ll eat, but it will be *in-between* busting your ass. You’ll need the fuel.”

“Shucks.”

Lena zipped her jacket higher, regretting the after-hours coffee with friends. It was late. Too late. And the bus hadn’t come.

Then came the hum of tires. A patrol car. It rolled to a stop beside her, window sliding down with a mechanical sigh.

“You shouldn’t be out alone,” the officer said. His face was pale in the dash glow. Calm. Kind, even. “Hop in. I’ll drive you.”

She hesitated.

“You don’t trust the police?” he asked, smiling.

That smile—that was the mistake. It was too polished. Too deliberate. But it was cold, and her phone was dead, and the road stretched into darkness.

The door clicked open.

He didn’t speak as they drove. No radio chatter. No engine noise, really—just the sound of gravel under tires and Lena’s breath tightening.

“Where are we going?” she asked.

He didn’t answer.

Instead, he turned down a narrow road lined with skeletal birch trees. The branches scraped the windshield like fingernails. Her mouth went dry.

“I—I live the other way.”

The car stopped.

He turned slowly, and the smile was gone.

“Girls like you,” he said softly, “never learn.”

She reached for the door handle.

It was locked.

Later, they would find the patrol car abandoned in a ravine.

1kysalg,https://i.redd.it/t2ptz9e6rt3f1.jpeg,The Ted Bundy case,"Theodore Robert Bundy was born on November 24, 1946, in Burlington, Vermont. His life began under a web of lies and deception. He was raised to believe that his mother, Eleanor Louise Cowell, was his sister and that his maternal grandparents were his parents. The true identity of his biological father remains uncertain to this day. Some records list a man named Lloyd Marshall, while others suggest his father may have been a military man whose identity was never officially confirmed. This deception regarding his parentage would profoundly affect his psychological development.

Bundy’s childhood appeared outwardly normal but was marked by deep dysfunction behind closed doors. His maternal grandfather, Samuel Cowell, was known to be an abusive, violent, and tyrannical figure who regularly beat his wife, terrorized his family, and displayed cruelty toward animals. Bundy was reportedly exposed to this environment of aggression and control during his formative years. His mother, Eleanor, eventually moved with Ted to Tacoma, Washington, to escape this toxic household, but the psychological damage had already begun to take root.

As a teenager, Bundy began displaying troubling behaviors that are commonly associated with psychopathy. He engaged in voyeurism, theft, and developed an intense fascination with violent pornography and stories about crime. Despite these dark tendencies, Bundy maintained a facade of a polite, well-mannered, and intelligent young man — a mask he would wear for much of his life. He learned to mimic normal social behaviors, using his charm and charisma to disarm those around him.

Bundy enrolled at the University of Washington in Seattle, where he studied psychology. During his time there, he was regarded as articulate, intelligent, and charismatic by his peers and professors. It was during this period that he entered into a romantic relationship with a woman widely known under the pseudonym Diane Edwards. She came from a wealthy family and had high social standards. When Diane eventually ended their relationship, citing Bundy’s lack of direction and ambition, it triggered an emotional and psychological collapse in him. Many criminologists believe this rejection planted the seeds of rage, inadequacy, and a pathological need to assert control, particularly over women who reminded him of Diane.

The first wave of his murders began in the early 1970s. Young college-aged women started disappearing from campuses across the Pacific Northwest, including Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, and Colorado. Bundy’s victims shared similar physical characteristics: they were typically young, attractive, white women with long brown hair parted down the middle. This physical type eerily resembled Diane Edwards, suggesting a psychological link between his first major rejection and his choice of victims.

Bundy developed highly manipulative techniques to lure his victims. He often feigned injuries, wearing a fake cast or using crutches, and asked women for help loading books, packages, or items into his infamous tan 1968 Volkswagen Beetle. Once the victim was close enough, he would strike them with a blunt object, handcuff them, and force them into his car, which had the passenger seat removed to facilitate hiding the victim out of sight. From there, he would drive them to secluded locations where he would subject them to horrific acts of sexual assault, torture, and murder. In many cases, Bundy would return to the dump sites days or even weeks later to engage in necrophilia. Some victims were decapitated, and he sometimes kept the severed heads in his apartment as trophies.

Bundy was arrested for the first time in August 1975 after a routine traffic stop in Utah. Police discovered burglary tools in his car — including handcuffs, a ski mask, a crowbar, rope, and duct tape — but initially lacked enough evidence to charge him with murder. However, mounting circumstantial evidence soon connected him to multiple disappearances. He was eventually convicted of kidnapping Carol DaRonch, one of the few women to survive an encounter with him.

In 1977, Bundy executed two brazen escapes from custody. The first involved jumping from a second-story courthouse library window while serving as his own legal counsel. He was recaptured six days later. The second, more audacious escape involved sawing a hole in the ceiling of his jail cell and crawling through the ceiling into the living quarters of a jailer, from where he walked out dressed in civilian clothes. This time, Bundy managed to flee across the country to Florida, where his crimes escalated to unprecedented levels of brutality.

On January 15, 1978, Bundy broke into the Chi Omega sorority house at Florida State University in Tallahassee. Within a span of just 15 minutes, he brutally attacked four sleeping women. He beat and strangled Lisa Levy and Margaret Bowman to death and severely injured Karen Chandler and Kathy Kleiner, leaving both with lasting physical and psychological injuries. Only a few hours after the sorority house attacks, Bundy broke into the apartment of Cheryl Thomas, another young woman, who survived but was left with permanent deafness and balance issues.

A few weeks later, Bundy abducted and murdered 12-year-old Kimberly Leach in Lake City, Florida. Her body was found months later in a pig shed, badly decomposed. The murder of Kimberly Leach marked a disturbing escalation — the victim was a child, far younger than his previous targets.

Bundy was arrested for the final time on February 15, 1978, after a traffic stop revealed he was driving a stolen vehicle. Fingerprints quickly confirmed his identity, ending his killing spree once and for all. His trial for the Chi Omega murders began in 1979 and became a media spectacle. It was the first trial in American history to be televised nationally. Bundy represented himself in court, showcasing his narcissism, arrogance, and manipulative charm. He cross-examined witnesses, engaged with the media, and even proposed marriage to Carol Boone, a former coworker, during the trial. Due to a peculiar Florida law, this proposal, made in the presence of a judge, was considered legally binding.

Bundy was found guilty of the Chi Omega murders and sentenced to death. A separate trial later resulted in another death sentence for the murder of Kimberly Leach. While on death row, Bundy spent years attempting to delay his execution by offering investigators information about additional murders, many of which he had previously denied. He confessed to 30 murders, but experts believe the actual number is likely much higher — possibly exceeding 100 victims.

On January 24, 1989, at 7:16 a.m., Ted Bundy was executed in the electric chair at Florida State Prison. Outside the prison, crowds gathered in a near-festival atmosphere, holding signs that read “Burn Bundy Burn” and celebrating the end of one of the most notorious serial killers in modern history.

Ted Bundy remains one of the most studied and infamous serial killers in criminal history. His psychological profile is often cited in forensic psychology as a textbook example of psychopathy. He exhibited classic traits: superficial charm, manipulativeness, a lack of empathy, egocentricity, and a complete absence of remorse. His ability to mask his monstrous nature behind a facade of intelligence and charm continues to serve as a chilling reminder of how dangerous predatory individuals can be when they appear to blend seamlessly into society.

Bundy’s life and crimes have been the subject of countless documentaries, films, books, and academic studies. Notable portrayals include the film Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile starring Zac Efron, and the Netflix documentary Conversations with a Killer: The Ted Bundy Tapes, which features hours of audio interviews with Bundy himself. His legacy is not only a gruesome chapter in the history of American crime but also a cautionary tale about the deceptive nature of evil hiding in plain sight.

Curiosities about Ted Bundy

	5.	Unconfirmed Victims: Bundy confessed to 30 murders, but many experts believe he may have killed over 100 people across several states, though much of this remains speculative due to lack of evidence.
	6.	Psychological Impact: Bundy’s ability to mimic normalcy and maintain relationships baffled psychologists and helped establish modern profiles of psychopathic serial killers.
	7.	Pop Culture Icon: Bundy has inspired numerous movies, books, podcasts, and even true crime tourism. His life story raises ethical questions about society’s fascination with serial killers.
	8.	Last Meal: For his last meal, Bundy reportedly ordered steak, eggs, hash browns, coffee, and a salad.

Him: 31M, Aquarius, Supply Chain Specialist

We’ve known each other socially for about 5 years. We first saw each others in 2019 at a corporate event, but he was the one who reached out to me first in 2021 — he remembered small details about me and said he admired how driven I was, and that we shared similar interests. He’s selective, reserved, and hyper-focused on his goals. I was connected to him in social media and I knew about his growing achievements in life. I respected and adored him but I always found men of his type way out my league so when he reached out I really felt special and someone he is trusting. But soon when I told him I am। not in same city as him anymore he stopped communicating with. He ghosted me although I offered friendship. Then a year later he reached again and ghosted again. I stopped taking him seriously but one time I did defended him and took his side when one of his business partners started spreading rumors about him. I genuinely believed he was in the right side. He was humbled by my support but although we become friends but he was still irregular.
Anyways, fast forward this year he suddenly called me and asked me out for coffee. when we met I was surprised how thoughtful he was and the same time flirted with me like a pro. I was completely surprised at his in person personality. We laughed, talked like goofy teenagers, career, relationships and also about sex fantasies. He tricked me into holding hands and we ended up kissing by the end of the evening. 

So you see,
When we’re together in person, he’s incredibly attentive and present. It’s intense, deep  like I’m the center of his world. But then he disappears for months. No messages, no calls. I’ve tried walking away, thinking he just isn’t interested, but then out of the blue intervals  of 2 months, 6 months later he reappears with a charm and I’m pulled back in. In our last date 2 months ago he’s told me about his demanding job, a car accident, plans to do this job for 2 more years before going all in on entrepreneurship, and his goal to retire before 40.
So like I understood he is driven guy but I don't understand is his pattern with me. now he’s unreachable again. It’s been months since our last contact. I genuinely liked him, but I don’t know what to make of this cycle anymore.",0,1748569519.0,Crushes,1,0.5,False

Hey besties, I need some solidarity and advice because I am STEAMED and ready to make someone's life very uncomfortable.

**The Setup**

I'm a single mom with three incredible daughters who are absolutely crushing it in college. I work as a director at a nonprofit (Harvard MA, lots of student loans, making a difference but not making bank, you know how it is), and I've been working one day a week at our local brewery as a side hustle. This gig brings in about $15k extra per year - money that goes straight to supporting my girls and their dreams.

The brewery is literally down the street from my house, all my neighbors are regulars, the team is amazing, and honestly? It's been pure good vibes. I love this job.

**Enter the Villain: ""Dick""**

Meet our antagonist - the property owner (NOT the business owner). Let's call him Dick because, well, accurate. This man is:

* A mansplaining, patronizing misogynist who apparently forgot deodorant exists
* Incredibly wealthy (owns the entire beach block) but dresses like he shops exclusively in dumpsters
* The kind of rich guy whose personality is just ""I'm good at business""
* A slumlord who won't fix anything and apparently has legal leases that allow this.  Apparently, this is quite typical of commercial leases.

Dick regularly camps out at the brewery, buys nothing, and basically treats the place like his personal hangout spot where he can snoop and feel important. He brings in a case of Ginger Beer that we keep in the back for him.  Nobody likes him - they just tolerate him because my hood is a laid-back beach town, and they just let him be him.

Here's where it gets personal: He's also the landlord for the coffee shop next door WHERE MY DAUGHTER WORKS. The roof is leaking; a ceiling tile almost clocked my kid in the head because the building is literally falling apart. 

**The Incident That Started It All**

Last Sunday was busy and sunny. Dick planted himself at the bar next to my neighbors (who are also good friends). Conversation turned to the coffee shop's business, and I casually asked if fixing a leaking roof was the landlord's responsibility.

Dick immediately got condescending, told me I was wrong, that's not how commercial leases work, blah blah blah. My response? ""I believe you. It doesn't sound right to me."" That's literally ALL I said.

The male manager was joking around loudly, saying ""Dick ain't gonna do shit!"" like three times. Everyone laughed.

**When Dick Lost His Mind**

I went to clear tables. When I came back, this man EXPLODED on me. Started yelling about how I was rude, disrespectful, didn't know what I was talking about, and maybe I should negotiate the coffee shop lease myself since I'm such an expert.

I've worked in bars. I've dealt with drunk assholes. I have NEVER had anyone yell at me like this. I just said goodbye and went to get my manager. Once my switch flipped, he would have been laid out on the floor. I had to remove myself from the situation.  I may have gone to Harvard, but I grew up in the projects.  I am not the one.  Earrings were about to come off with this man talking sideways to me. 

Dick kept raging, demanding my name, calling me ""that employee,"" and saying I had no right to have opinions about the lease next door. My manager told him my name didn't matter and kicked him out. Witnesses backed up my story.

**The Retaliation Begins**

Dick left a screaming voicemail for the brewery owner demanding I be fired. The owner texted the manager asking what happened stating that he knew Dick was crazy.  My manager explained what happened and that seemed to be the end of it. But my spidy senses told me it wasn’t. And I was right.

PLOT TWIST: The next day, my daughter calls asking what happened. Dick had called the coffee shop owner, screaming about me and demanding apologies from both the owner AND my daughter.

**The Final Blow**

Today (Thursday), my manager called. He was clearly upset. He had to fire me. When I asked why (I have HR experience), he couldn't give me a real answer. No performance issues, no customer complaints, no staff problems. Just that Dick was pissed and demanded I be taken off the schedule.

I told him this was wrongful termination without cause. He said he fought for me, but the owner made the decision. The owner was supposed to call me - still waiting.

**The Damage**

* Lost $15k annual income my family needs
* Lost my social life and neighborhood hangout spot
* My daughter was about to start working there too - not happening now
* A misogynist bully got exactly what he wanted

**Why I'm Ready for War ⚔️**

The more I think about this, the angrier I get. I did absolutely NOTHING wrong. A man was literally mocking this guy to his face, but he chose to explode on the woman who dared to have a quiet opinion.

I want to sue Dick for lost wages and defamation. I want to make his life miserable. He got me fired, but I want it to cost him not me.

**So Besties... How Do I BTAA?**

(Bring That Ass-whooping)

I'm ready to move in the shadows and make this man regret messing with the wrong single mom. What's my next move? Where do I start?  Any creative idea?

He has always been on the extreme level of tidiness, the type who feels they can’t relax if anything is out of place or ‘calling to him’ to be done, takes pride in deep cleaning the bathroom to the extent surgery could be performed in there on a weekly basis (he’s literally said this before), gets over stimulated if his bare feet detect anything on the floor.. etc. He admittedly has a lot of ‘rules’ and says it’s hard to be in his head and I’ve always been able to empathize with that and come from a place of love. He recently got on anti-depressants, which I am also on, to help in addition to meditating and reading a million self help books over the years. We have had several talks about what we each can do to navigate his borderline OCD. Obviously, finding a man who takes pride in his space and enjoys cleaning seemed like a godsend at first. But lately I’m reaching my breaking point with the nit-picking and condescending tone he’s taking on concerning the things I ‘overlook’ WHEN cleaning, usually when he’s at work and for his peace of mind, since I get off earlier and don’t require a completely sterile house to relax. For context, if there are dishes in the sink I load them, if the washer is full I unload and reload it, if the trash is full I take it out, if my dog went outside when it’s muddy/snowy I soak his paws in warm water and towel them off every single time he potties, if I’m last to get out of bed I make the bed, if I spill a drop of coffee or grain of salt on the counter I wipe it up, if I use the last of something I replace it. Just general courteous things I’ve always done because I also like a clean home, and a few extras that I don’t mind doing for his peace of mind. He also does all of these things… and a lot more. 

So for whatever reason this week has been rough. There have been about 10 little instances that irked me, and one that finally broke me. The other night he came home as usual to a spotless kitchen after I unloaded the washer and loaded dishes from the sink (mostly his, he’s a 3 beverage at a time person and eats breakfast where as I do not), and instead of being grateful it all got done, passive aggressively scrubbed the sink because I guess there was a speck of something I didn’t get when I also sprayed it out. He was home maybe 10 minutes before politely requesting that when I do the dishes I make sure there isn’t ’rotting food’ left in the sink (there absolutely wasn’t). This morning while I was getting ready for work (I leave 2 hours before him) he said from the other room in a cute voice that my dog was at the back door and was ‘extra dirty’ as it’s been raining. I said all good, I’ll just bathe him. Bathed the dog, toweled him off with one of my own towels from my old place, and blow dried him. Enter him using the bathroom, noticing the missing towel and remarking that I used a ‘human’ towel for my dog as if a clean one wasn’t hanging right there and as if I hung a soiled towel back on the rack. I checked our cabinet where the 2 ‘dog towels’ are and it was empty as they are in the wash, which I pointed out (FTR, he loves my dog, he’s allowed on the furniture, sleeps in the bed when he wants to, etc.)

I ended up breaking down and getting upset because rushing to bathe and DRY my dog in the little time I had before I go into work was not something I’d do if I lived alone, and I’m starting to feel like nothing is good enough. We did talk and he hugged and apologized, said he never wants to make me feel small but I’m starting to be miserable in our beautiful home because I feel like I can’t actually LIVE without constantly being scrutinized. I work outside all day and it’d be nice to come home and relax OR enjoy my morning without stressing about what he might find to stress about. 

I have been so on top of the little things he’s mentioned (the dog paws, dusting, making sure the counters are surgically spotless at all times, folding a blanket on the couch after I’m done using it, hanging my purse instead of sitting it on our entry bench) but then there’s always something else. I’m starting to feel like I’m actually cleaning MORE than he is and he’s just coming in to pick at little things afterwards. Or are these universally big things and I’m not as clean as I thought I was? How do other ‘normal’ clean people live with neat freaks and what are your boundaries? I have a lot of hobbies and between work, keeping myself active and present and trying to be generally happy and healthy, I don’t feel like I have much more bandwidth or patience to dedicate to these tiny things to me that are obviously a big deal to him. 

This turned into a bit more of a vent than I intended but I’m still in my feels, apologies.

This is not a knock on Melbourne! It’s an amazing city. But it just doesn’t feel remotely “European” to me, and I don’t really understand what people mean by it when they say it.

In terms of streetscape I would say it is more American than even Sydney — heavily gridded and suburban, with wide car-suitable boulevards everywhere. 

In terms of culture — I mean, both Sydney and Melbourne have a similar multicultural vibe that is similar to parts of Europe now, but also quite similar to the US.

There are more pronounced seasons, but the range of weather conditions within Europe is so varied, wider than the variation between Sydney and Melbourne to be honest.

Is it just a way of saying that the coffee is better and there are more cute shopping laneways and small bars around? I can kind of get that, but I don’t see that this quality is distinctively European.

I sort of think this is a last relic of some sort of cultural cringe. Melbourne isn’t “European”. It doesn’t need to be “European” to be good. it’s a great Australian city and that should be enough to recommend it!",18,1748568401.0,AskAnAustralian,63,0.83,False

**Chapter One: Mr. & Mrs. Cunningham**

Once upon a long time ago, situated in a majestic group of mountains, there was a quaint little village named Willowbrook. It is one of the many situated in the majestic and beautiful land of Alexandria. A kingdom where the summers are not too hot, and the winters are not too cold. A land filled with beautiful lakes, deep forests, and glorious fields filled with delicious crops and gorgeous wildflowers to provide plenty of food for the glad people in this wondrous land. Living comfortably in this pleasant village was the wonderful Cunningham family. William Cunningham is the most successful businessman in Willowbrook. He has lived in Willowbrook for the last thirty years and owns and runs multiple businesses in and around the village. He owns the village general store where… He owns and runs the village hotel where… He owns and runs the fanciest restaurant in Willowbrook, where the menu never stays the same. It is situated inside the hotel, where he can provide many different meals for the hotel guests and village locals. He calls the restaurant “The Enchanted Sisters” after his two beautiful daughters. He owns the village lumber yard where… He owns and runs the old village apple orchard and cider mill where thousands of delicious apples, pears, peaches, and oranges are handpicked from the hundreds of fruit trees that grow on the land near the mill and throughout the grassy plains near the village entrance. These fruits are then taken to the mill, where they are transformed and created into different goods to sell at the general store or served at the restaurant.

Mr. William Cunningham is a tall, strong, and handsome middle-aged man with dark brown hair and bright green eyes. His kindness spreads to everyone he meets, works with, and cares for in and around all his businesses. He goes by many different names, such as Sir, Mister, or Mr. Cunningham. However, the locals always call him William or Will. He is a man who likes to keep busy and likes to be moving all the time. As busy as he is with running all his businesses, he is also finishing his final manuscript for a cookbook he has been working on for the last ten years. A cookbook on how to make different kinds of bread and the tricks to baking them perfectly every single time without fail. He hopes to get it published and distributed throughout all of Alexandria. After a long day of work, he can usually be found in his favorite armchair near a roaring fireplace reading a good book.

He and his wife Ruth have been married for almost twenty-five years, and he always says he has been the happiest man in the world since he met her. Ruth Cunningham is a beautiful and talented woman whom everyone in the village has come to admire and respect. She is tall with long black hair and dark brown eyes. Besides helping William with all his businesses, Ruth is also the village midwife and has a small office in the village doctor’s clinic. The clinic is located right next door to the hotel, so that if someone in the hotel or restaurant needs medical attention, they can receive it in no time at all.

Ruth and William have twin daughters named Cynthia and Ophelia. Ruth loves her husband and daughters with all her heart, and she often daydreams of the wonderful things they have done and could do since she and William started building their family sixteen years ago. On a cold night in December, Ruth gave birth to identical twin daughters, whom they named Cynthia and Ophelia. Each of them was unique, even though they were identical. Cynthia was born with dark black hair but bright blue eyes. She is the oldest of the twins by three minutes. Ophelia was born with bright blonde hair but had dark, violet-colored eyes.

**Chapter Two: Cynthia & Ophelia Cunningham**

**Chapter Three: An Emergency Delivery**

One night during a heavy rainstorm, the Cunninghams were closing the store and restaurant up for the evening. Suddenly, a stagecoach came rushing up to the front of the hotel from out of nowhere. The frantic coachman quickly jumped down off his coach and yelled for help.

They all rushed over to the coach and saw the young woman having a difficult time breathing, and saw that she was bleeding heavily from a wound on her abdomen. Being the most amazing midwife that she is, Ruth acted quickly by asking William and the coachman, who introduced himself as Barney Franklinstine, to carry the young woman into the clinic. Ruth then began to ask the struggling mom some important questions.

The men brought her into the clinic and placed her on a bed in an empty room.

The woman continued to have a difficult time breathing, and her labor began to intensify.

When Ruth asked this, the woman took a short, labored breath and answered her.

Ruth asked William and Barney to go outside to give Danielle some privacy. They did so, and William gave Barney some coffee to warm himself up and told him that he could stay at the hotel overnight while the storm passed. Ruth, Cynthia, and Ophelia prepared Danielle for a hard, difficult delivery. The girls would run back and forth, getting the things their mother and the village doctor needed. The village doctor, Dr. Augustus Brown, helped and encouraged Danielle through the contractions, and Ruth coached her in the delivery. After a long six hours of hard labor, everyone finally heard the cry of a healthy baby. The girls helped clean the newborn, bundled it up to keep it warm, and handed the child to Ruth. Ruth then handed the child to Danielle to hold for the first time. Danielle smiled down at her newborn child, looked up at Ruth, and said,

Suddenly, Danielle passed out and stopped breathing altogether. Ruth handed the baby back to Cynthia, and she began to help the doctor treat Danielle to revive her. After a few moments of struggle, they were able to save Danielle from death, but it came with some terrible consequences. Yes, Danielle is alive physically, but she becomes nonverbal and childlike herself. She couldn’t speak and didn’t know who she was or the fact that she had just had a baby. Dr. Brown explained to the girls that while she was unconscious, her brain did somewhat of reset, and when she woke up, she lost some of her present memories. He instructed Ruth, William, and the girls never to tell Danielle that the child is hers, never to leave the child with her, and to take care of her and the newborn, for she would now need someone to depend on, for she was like a child herself now.

**Chapter Four: Delilah Cunningham**

The baby, a little red-headed girl like Danielle, was adopted by the Cunningham’s and they gave Danielle a room in the attic of the hotel and a job with housekeeping at the hotel. For her protection, they placed a small bell around her waist every day, so they knew where she was because she tended to wander off sometimes. Now, Cynthia and Ophelia had a baby sister, whom the family decided to name Delilah in honor of her birth mother, Danielle. After sixteen years, Delilah has grown into a beautiful, spirited young woman. Eventually, a few years ago, the Cunninghams told Delilah about Danielle and what had happened on that stormy night. Delilah understood and thanked them for adopting her and taking care of Danielle. The three girls went everywhere together and did everything together. Cynthia and Ophelia continued to work in the hotel, restaurant, and bakery, having more responsibilities than before, while Delilah finished her final year at the village school. Life was simple, but all of that was about to change.

**Chapter Five: Life-Changing Circumstances**

One evening, after picking Delilah up from school, the three girls were walking in the direction of the general store when they saw a lot of people standing outside the hotel and restaurant entrance.

The village chairman, a short, fluffy man named Mr. Gabriel Rogers, ran up to the girls before they could get any closer to the crowd.

The girls gasped in horror, and Delilah began to weep. Ophelia held her tight and assured her that everything would be alright. As they began to walk to the scene, Mr. Rogers continued with the facts.

The girls walked up to the hotel and saw the doctor treating William. William was so upset about the attack that all he did was sit silently in a hotel armchair, refusing to speak to anyone. Cynthia walked over to him and the doctor, with Ophelia and Delilah close behind her.

Cynthia helped the doctor place a sling on her father’s arm and told the doctor they would make sure he rested it. The girls took William home and laid him in his bed. For the next three days, which is where William slept without talking to them. He wouldn’t eat or drink anything at all, only feeling sorry for himself and disappointed he couldn’t protect Ruth and Danielle from being kidnapped. All he would do was sit in a chair in the room, look out the window, and stare out all day, wishing to see his precious Ruth once more. Three weeks later, the chairman and his men still couldn’t find anything else that could lead them to the villains who attacked William. No clue whether or not Ruth and Danielle were alive, but he told the girls not to lose hope that they were alive. The case got cold, and after another two weeks, there were still no leads.

**Chapter Six: Doing What Is Best**

William’s health continued to get worse as he barely ate anything and did not speak a word to anyone. The girls wanted so much to see Ruth and Danielle return safely and to see William happy once again. So, they sat together one night with their father and had a long discussion about their future and what they thought was the best thing to do. After much deliberation and discussion, the Cunninghams decided to leave Willowbrook and head to the capital city of Dapplewood; the great center of Alexandria, where the great king Frederick Alexander and his lovely wife Queen Josephine Elizabeth lived. Maybe they could help them with their case and find Danielle and Ruth. They left the hotel, restaurant, store, bakery, and the other of William’s businesses to the chairman to oversee for this difficult time they are gone. The chairman and other people of Willowbrook began helping them pack up their belongings for their long journey. They were sad and a bit surprised to see them leave but understood why and wished them well and a safe journey. As they began their journey to the capital, Cynthia would sing songs, Ophelia would tell or read stories, and Delilah would remind them of happy, joyful, and silly times they had had. William would smile occasionally but would still never say a word. Cynthia proudly told her father, “We are going to find Mama, Papa! We promise. We will find them both in no time!” Once they arrived in Dapplewood a week later, they bought a small cottage on the edge of the capital. They moved in their belongings and began to make the small house into a home. The cottage had two bedrooms, a large kitchen, and a great living room space. Perfect for the four of them to start a new life. The girls put their father into the smallest of the two bedrooms and the three of them were set to share the other slightly larger room. Cynthia and Ophelia had beds in two of the corners while Delilah slept in a bed above them in a loft. Once settled into their new home, the girls went right to work. Cynthia began to write down their entire dilemma in full detail, so they might present it to the king himself. Ophelia cared for their father who seemed to drift further away as the days went by, barely eating anything at all. She introduced herself to the local doctor, Dr. Edward Jacobson, so they may call upon him when their father is in need. Dr. Edward went to examine William that same day and instructed him to eat better and to get plenty of sunshine. He warned the girls of his declining health, and they told him they would do their best. Delilah helped by keeping the house clean, making sure everything was in its place, and assisting Cynthia and Ophelia when they needed extra help or even a tea break.

**Chapter Seven: Off To The Palace**

After three days of non-stop work, Cynthia had finished writing their dilemma down and it was ready to present to the king’s court. Dr. Jacobson came to stay with William, whom the girls told the whole story, and their father for the first time since the event, began to tell Dr. Jacobson about his dear Ruth. The girls went off to the palace to present their case to the king. Once the girls arrived at the palace, they requested an audience with the king immediately. They presented a copy of their case to the king’s grand viewer, Sir Arthur Hemmingway, who asked them to wait in the front waiting area near the main palace entrance. While they waited, a servant offered them each a cup of tea and some cakes. They thanked her and dined quietly. After a while, an anxious Delilah asked Ophelia, “Do you think the king will see us, Ophelia?” “I hope so, Delilah. For father’s sake, I hope so.” After two hours of waiting, Sir Arthur walked over to them and said, “I am so sorry to have kept you waiting this long ladies. Please follow me. The King and the rest of the royal family are ready to see you now.” The girls stood up and followed him through many doors and rooms. They were so nervous but ready for any questions the king may have for them. They walked into a grand room filled with books, maps, and scrolls. It also had a juvenile of the known world in the middle of the room along with a miniature replica of Alexandria next to a set of large windows. Cynthia, Ophelia, and Delilah were amazed at the size of the room and all of its wondrous items inside. Past the globe sitting at a large table that was covered in piles of maps, scrolls, and piles of other reports was the royal family. The King, the queen, and their three sons; the royal princes of Alexandria. Sir Arthur instructed the girls to wait a few feet away while he approached the king to introduce them. “Excuse me, your amenities. These young ladies are here with a case in which they have traveled from Willowbrook to ask you for your immediate assistance. It is a matter of life and death, my highness.” The girls stepped forward and bowed before the elegant royal family. The King was quite taken with the girl’s manners and asked them to rise. “Hello, young ladies. What is your case that you have traveled so far to present to me? Please have a seat and tell us about your dilemma.” Cynthia presented another full copy of their written case and explained what had happened to their parents and Danielle. When the queen heard these details, she gasped in horror and asked, “Are you the only children of William and Ruth Cunningham?” “Ophelia and I are their biological twin daughters, but Delilah here is adopted.” Cynthia continued by explaining the events that happened the night Delilah was born and how her father was kidnapped, and her mother was injured. She explained that it was in the same manner as the robbery at the hotel with Danielle and their mother Ruth’s kidnapping. No witnesses, no clues, and a single stabbing attack. The King stood to his feet and said, “We shall begin the investigation immediately.” Everyone else stood up as the king walked around the table to where his sons were. “Now may I introduce to you, own sons. This is our oldest son; Edward, our middle son; Nicolas, and our youngest son; Richard.” The princes bowed to the girls and the girls gladly bowed to them in return. “Now, my boys. Please escort these lovely ladies home. It is too dark out for such polite young people to be walking home. Give our regards to your father and let him know that the investigation has begun.” The girls and princes bowed to the king and queen, and the three handsome princes escorted the girls out of the room and into an elegant coach that was ready to take them home back to their cottage. When they arrived back at the cottage, Prince Edward asked Cynthia if he could speak to her father on the king’s behalf. At that moment, Dr. Jacobson bowed to the royalist and left William in his daughter’s care. Cynthia introduced her father to Prince Edward and his brothers. William thanked him and his brothers for bringing the girls back home safely. Edward told William that the investigation to find Ruth and Danielle had begun. Prince Edward then asked, “Sir William, my brothers and I would be honored if you and your lovely daughters would join us for dinner. Would tomorrow night be alright?” The girls smiled, and William accepted the invention and thanked them for everything they were doing for him and his family. The three princes smiled back at the girls, and Prince Edward told them they would arrive to fetch them tomorrow afternoon around five o’clock.

**Chapter Eight: Dinner At The Palace**

**Chapter Nine: Another Life-Changing Circumstance**

As they were riding home, the coachman told the princes about a strange glow shining over the next hill near where the cottage would be. As they drove over the hill, they saw that the range glow was their sweet little cottage was on fire. Delilah began to cry, while William just stared into the flames as they destroyed their home. We are now, truly lost, he said with bated breath. That’s not true, Father. We still have each other. Plus, if we were not at the palace for dinner, we might be worse off. Edward, Nicholas, and Richard knew right away what they had to do. Edward signaled the driver, and they took William and the girls back to the palace where they would be safe from any other further trouble. Once they were all back at the palace, they told the king and queen what had happened to the cottage. The queen hugged them all and stated, “Of course, you should stay here. It will be best for everyone, and you will be protected here.” The queen escorted them to a private suite where there were four large bedrooms grouped by a grand living hall filled with tables, desks, and comfortable couches to sit on. It was like a house inside the palace, and then some. The girls put their father in the bedroom that was themed around the color brown, and he slept hard for the rest of the night. Cynthia slept in the blue bedroom that looked like an ocean underwater world. Ophelia was in the purple room that looked like she was living in a cloud. Delilah was in the green room that looked like an enchanted forest filled with trees and animals. William slept for the next three days and became quite ill due to his refusal to eat or drink anything. Dr. Jacobson and a few other doctors came many times to treat William, but the only curse was if he ate something and drank some water. The doctors told the girls that it was the worst case of a broken heart he had seen in their combined forty years of practice. Soon, with the king and queen’s help, they were finally able to get William to eat and drink something for his daughter’s sake.

**Chapter Ten: Life At The Palace**

Life in the palace became quiet after the fire. The King and William spent most of the time together, figuring out more clues about the kidnappings, stabbings, and the cottage fire. The queen and Cynthia spent most of their time together talking in the royal parlor or as they walked through the castle halls. They would share recipes, and Cynthia would tell the queen that she was hoping to see her mother again, but the queen was so kind that she reminded Cynthia of her mother. Ophelia and Delilah spent most of their time in the library, reading books and studying maps. When the weather was nice, the two of them would be in the royal stables, grooming and riding some of the horses. In the evenings, they all had dinner together in the grand dining hall and talked all about what they did or discovered that day. Once dinner was finished, the girls would dance with the princes until it was time to retire for the night. The girls were enjoying their new life at the palace, and they loved seeing how much their father was improving every day, discovering new clues that may lead to the return of Danielle and his beloved Ruth. As the weeks went by and they spent more time with the princes, their hearts were full, and they felt completely at home. The six of them were so comfortable together. Edward was falling in love with Cynthia, and Cynthia was with him. Nicolas was falling in love with Ophelia, and Ophelia was with him. Richard was falling in love with Delilah, and Delilah was with him. William was so glad to see his girls finding love during these difficult times. After a few months, the king and his men made many interesting developments in the case and discovered the person behind the robberies, stabbings, kidnapping, and cottage fire. It was the king’s own jealous, exiled younger brother, Jacob Godfrey. He was banished to the Umberwood Mountains after he tried to kill the king before Edward was born and secured his position with a ligament heir. But the question remains… Why, after all these years, has he attacked these innocent people? The King brought the queen, his sons, the girls, and William together and updated them on their findings. When the king finished, Cynthia began to ask questions. What does any of this have to do with us? Why did he target us? Why did he kidnap Danielle and our mother? Why stab our father? What does it have to do with us? The King looked at William and said, “William, it is time to tell them everything. The girls looked all confessed and looked at their father.

**Chapter Eleven: William's Confession**

William took a deep breath and began to explain the whole story. “When I was much younger, before I was this successful businessman, I am today, and way before I met your mother, I was a knight here in his majesty’s royal guard.” Ophelia and Delilah’s jaws dropped, and everyone moved in closer and sat down while William continued. “I was even promoted to Captain of the Guard and would be the Grand Knight, meaning I would oversee the other knights and those who were put in prison or sentenced to life in the dungeons. I also oversaw the palace security team.” The girls were so surprised and gasped at him as he continued with his tale. “It was during the time of Jacobs’s attack that would test not only me but every knight in his majesty’s royal guard. When he attempted to murder the king, I was the one who defeated him and ended the attack. He was brought before the court and sentenced to life in exile. With the help of four other knights, we escorted him to the base of the Umberwood Mountains. I was responsible for getting him there and making sure he stayed there. As we left him, he shouted back threats at me, the other knights, and the royal family. He said he would make everyone pay.” William stood to his feet, walked over to a large window, looked out at the setting sun, and continued his story. “After a few years, three of the other knights who took Jacob to the mountains; Sir Quincy Robertson, Sir George Youngingshire, and Sir Charles Davidson went missing along with their possessions and families. We were never able to find them or the person who did it. The cases turned cold, but I grew weary knowing I could be next. So, I told the king that I and the other surviving knight, Sir Harry de LaFleur should move away for the safety of the royal family and the kingdom. The hotel, restaurant, store, lumber yard, mill, and recently, the bakery were funded by the king himself. Life was simple, good, and quiet, and I began to feel like I could live without worrying about him finding me. After a few years, I met Ruth and we fell in love. Not long after we met, we were married. Soon after, the twins were born, and I was truly the happiest man on earth. Alas sixteen years later came the night the stage came into town and Delilah’s birth mother Danielle was in labor after being stabbed and robbed. When she told us her name, I knew who she was. Her husband was Sir Harry LaFleur, the other knight who was in hiding like me. He and Danielle were coming to Willowbrook to warn me that the attacks were happening again. After what happened to Danielle the only right thing to do was to adopt Delilah and take in Danielle to protect them too. For the next sixteen years, it was peaceful again, but I was always on edge that another attack was soon upon us. My intuition was right the night of the robbery, and the kidnapping of Danielle and my beloved Ruth. That is why the attackers were unable to hurt me worse than they did, it was in that stab they used to distract me and kidnap Danielle and Ruth. They are being held captive because of my connections and involvement in Jacobs’s defeat, capture, and exile.” The girls huddled around their father and hugged him tightly. Cynthia told him that everything was alright and that he was only doing his duty to protect Alexandria. William was tired and became sad after telling the story because it made him think of Ruth. Everyone else agreed it was time to rest for the night.

**Chapter Twelve: Life-Changing Circumstances For William**

The next morning everyone came down for breakfast, except William. Cynthia went to his room to check on her father and to her surprise found that he would not wake up. She felt his forehead and discovered he was quite feverish. She ran down to the king and asked for the doctors to come right away. The King sent for the doctors who arrived soon after. The royal doctors examined him alongside the king’s most trusted wizard and found he had developed an infection in the shoulder wound. After some medication, tonics, and tests, they discovered the wound was more serious than before. It was suggested that William not be moved from his bed until the fever breaks and the wound hopefully improves. His room was kept quiet, and the doctors and palace staff kept a close visual over him for the next six days. On the seventh day, the doctors warned the girls that if he didn’t improve, they might lose him. The girls passed the halls near his room, trying to produce a solution.",1,1748568387.0,theEichlerChronicles,0,1.0,False

4. So much of S2 was rewritten to kill off Nat, that we will never get the bonus episode because so much of it references the original writing that was cut. 
5. Juliette left because of issues with other cast members and not storyline. 
6. Showtime only cares about signing up big name guest stars and focusing the marketing around them, so YJ had a messy and blast minute marketing roll out.

Granola bar, toast, sometimes nothing. Then came the 10 a.m. crash, the random snacking, and the zero motivation by lunchtime.

Three weeks ago, I decided to try something different: **high-protein breakfasts**. I’m not talking about shakes or just adding eggs — I mean intentional meals that are protein-focused, filling, and balanced.

Here’s what I noticed:

* **No more mid-morning hunger**. Like, at all. I go from 7 a.m. to lunch without even thinking about food.
* **Energy is way more stable**. No sugar crashes. No weird brain fog.
* **Fewer random snacks throughout the day**. Especially the “bored” snacking I used to do at my desk.
* **I actually look forward to breakfast now**. Which is weird for me, because I never used to care.

The cool part? You don’t need to cook from scratch every morning. I found a few solid recipes that I prep on Sundays — some I bake in ramekins, others I just reheat from frozen. Easy.

I wrote a full post about it if anyone wants to dig deeper (no ingredients, just insights and structure):

I began existing centuries before the Humans got to the Federation, and was my duty was souls of the Federation (as stated earlier, I'm not the only one, but I've never seen a soul outside of it so... I guess I'll only see them).

The ""job"" as the living call my task is pretty redundant. When I arrive somwhere, I always know the specie, name, and cause of passing. The first information is the most important, for it tells me a lot on how to handle the soul.  
The Kla'rik, a race of fighters, will always go down with a fight. Sometimes it's out of denial, refusal, thinking they can overcome Death. Sometimes it's an inexplicable feeling of going down with a fight. My favourite are the sparring, the ritual aspect of respect to ""The one I've made seen to so many"" as the sparrers call me, even the elderly who pass from old age deserve honor.  
The Jzigig, an artificial life-form with a conflicted past of successive hive-minds and oppression, were to be expected positive emotionnal outbursts. Being recognized as living beings is always a form of relief... but it goes down rapidly when they understand why I'm here. The first Jzigig assigned to me was as confused to meet me as I was to meet them. Their cause of death stated ""fried motherboard""...  
The Halkometh, a race with an exceptionnal life-span, are a bit complicated. Some consider that they are immune to death (wich is fairly true, since they can't die of most illnesses nor old age) and are outraged to meet their end. The other part of them greet me like some sort of celebrity, somehow happy to finally meet The One That Everyone Shall See.

But the Humans...! After centuries, or perhaps millenias of meetings with human soul, I still can't figure out how to greet them. Sadly, outside of the three informations, I can't know anything the soul won't tell me. Sometimes, I can see the living in their past moments and figure out things, like their main occupations, a person they hold dear, or a work that they'll never finish... But they don't always get lucky. When they see me at the same time I see them, I feel... happy ? No, excited would be a more correct term. A Kla'rik will always fight, a Jzigig will ask questions I'll answered billions of time, and even the Halkometh or the Yugoth are predictable. But not the Humans. Unpredictable. After the countless souls of various specie I met, only humans managed to get me off-guard. The one that will probably forever stick in my memory is a Medic, a person who treats the wounded on a battlefield so they don't die. This one, Garry, should have died of a stress-induced heart attack hours before we left. But I allowed him to live a little longer...

It was the longest time I spent with a soul. When he saw me, he jumped straight on me, forbidding me to make any step further. ""These soldiers are under my watch, and if these God-forsaken Ulgariths didn't managed to bring you for them, you'll better prepare yourself to go back empty handed, because I'm gonna save every single one of them. You made me lost enough time, fuck right off from whence you came, I've got lives to save !""... It caught me off guard. I sat in a corner, watching him chewing on the unconcious soldiers' heads, as he did with me.  
When I told him the cause of death, he looked frantically to the heart monitors of the 20 wounded under his watch, ""BPMs are nominal for all of them, I told you I will save them."". When I told him the specie of the soul I came to take, he told me that I was wrong, since he was the only human in this tent. I knew that if I revealed the last information, he would crash. It's a strange feeling, seeing a dead person frantically moving around, tending to people with missing parts, repeating the same cleaning ritual while walking on a muddy and blood-soaked soil.  
At one point, I started to doubt my own never-failling informations, but in a flash, I saw his name on his badge : Garry. That's when I intervened. I stood up, put my scythe on the side (Humans picture me with a scythe so I always have one when I meet them), and searched for more informations on him in this tent. I learnt his grade, qualifications and records on a datapad. I learnt his religion, the name of his friends and patients, and even his favorite ale when he muttered to a sleeping fellow he was stitching a wound.  
I called him by his full name, including grades and military honors, and asked if I could be of any help. ""For Christ's sake, I've been tending to 20 morons for hours, and the nurse that God sent me is the fucking Reaper ! These higher-ups will definitively hear me once I get out of this tent !  
\- I'm afraid, lover of Francis, that you will not. When I arrived, I only knew three things about the soul I came for. It's race, cause of death... and name.  
\- H-Huh...? You mean I-...  
\- Roughly for hours ago, yes. When I sat down in that corner, it should have been the time where you'd be accepting your passing. But for some reason, you kept going despite your body functions stopping. You didn't noticed you stopped breathing, bathroom break or even not feeling thirst. Dead don't need all of that.  
\- Why then ?  
\- It's my doing. Though I could not explain why, Garry, but I've decided to let you finish your task. And, for the only occurence in my existence, I will save a life.  
\- You don't have a list of people who will die ? These men, women and other lying here, will they live ?  
\- I don't have such list. Judging by your determination and qualifications, they will.  
\- Then let's not loose any other second, people are dying under this tent !  
\- You don't say...""  
I helped Garry for the next couple of hours, as his assisstant, giving him the tools or information he needed. When the last patient was out of danger, he finally sat down and looked at his mug.  
""Shit, it's cold now. 'To Hell and back' well, I won't make it back this time, boys...  
\- Nor will you make it to hell.  
\- Oh, you're making gallows humor now ?, he chuckled.  
\- Where you go, they got a coffee so heavenly good, it's damnable.""  
He burst into a laugh. And when I walked him to the afterlife, he threatened his mates one last time ""I don't want to see any single one of you before 20 years.""",74,1748567974.0,humansarespaceorcs,6,1.0,False
1kyrqwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1kyrqwn/you_used_to_look_so_happy/,“You used to look so happy”,"Quick context - have been married for 20 years (me - 49M, her - 48F). Been in a sexless marriage for a decade. Have a 10yo son. Love my wife and have been supporting her as she’s going through a massive project of overcoming childhood trauma, but also struggling with the lack of physical connection.

This evening, my wife had added a lot of older pictures to our digital photo frame. Many from our younger days.

My son was looking at them and said, “You used to look so happy.” 

My heart broke. I’m having a tough night. Lots of work stress. Feeling like there’s an endless amount of house work to deal with. I’m trying to constantly figure out how to overcome 20 years of no communication about sex, and then to hear this hit SO hard. 

I’m not sure what to say - just needed some lovely internet strangers who know how hard marriage can be to get express my pain and heartache.

My wife and I have our weekly coffee date in the morning, and part of me is screaming to tell her that our son wasn’t wrong in his observation, but I also know myself - I’ll get too into my head and I’ll be too uncomfortable putting this on her…even though I know this doesn’t get fixed without both of us working together.

That vulture eye. Cold. Pale. Veiled in a bluish film that watched me… even when it didn’t move. I loved the old man. Truly. He had never wronged me. Never insulted me. Never denied me anything. But that eye? It saw things. It *knew* things. It stripped me bare with every glance, laying open my soul like a book left out in the rain. I couldn’t escape its gaze — not in waking life, not even in dreams.

I began to dread the daylight, when it might open. I began to hate the shadows, in which its memory lingered. I tried to avert my thoughts, distract myself with books or work — but always, always, the eye would return. Watching. Judging. Knowing.

So I waited.

Every night, at the stroke of midnight, I crept into his room. Silently. Slowly. Carefully. Like a shadow learning to breathe. I’d open the lantern — just a sliver — enough to shine on that cursed eye. For seven nights… it stayed closed. Closed tight, like it was mocking me. As if it *knew* why I came. I stared at the lids, clenched fists trembling in the dark, lips dry, breath shallow. But I couldn’t do it. I wouldn't strike unless it was open.

On the eighth night… he stirred. A floorboard betrayed me. I paused, frozen, mid-step. He sat up suddenly and whispered, his voice a thin ribbon of fear:  
“Who’s there?”

My heart pounded like a war drum. I dared not breathe. The lantern flickered in my hand. And then — the eye opened.

That pale, soulless eye locked onto mine. Shining like ice beneath the moon. Cold. Merciless. Infinite. In that instant, I knew what I had to do. It was no longer a man I saw, but the eye — the monstrous, watching eye.

That was the moment. That was the signal. I lunged.

One cry — muffled by the mattress — and he was gone. Lifeless. The eye would never open again.

And I… I felt nothing. No guilt. No sorrow. Only peace. Sweet, ringing silence. The kind that hums in your ears like the hush of a snowfall.

I dismembered the body with surgical care. No mess. No blood. I had planned every detail. I removed the planks of the sitting room floor, placed him beneath, and returned the boards. Perfect. Seamless. Clean. Not a trace left behind.

When morning came, I even opened the windows. Let in the light. Brewed coffee. Sat calmly in the same room. Victory was warm in my chest.

Then the knock.

Three men. Police. A neighbor had reported a scream. Just routine, they said. I smiled. Welcomed them in. I was confident. Clever. Untouchable. I invited them to sit — right above him. Right above the body.

We talked. I laughed. I charmed them. I poured them tea. I showed them the house, every corner. Nothing to hide. The performance was perfect.

And then… the sound.

Faint at first.  
*Thump-thump... thump-thump...*

I stiffened. It grew louder.  
*Thump-thump... THUMP-THUMP...*

Not outside. Not in the walls. From below. Beneath the floorboards. Beneath their feet. From *within* me.

They didn’t hear it. They kept chatting, sipping tea, smiling. But I heard it. Oh, I heard it! It pounded in my chest, echoed in my ears, burned in my blood. *THUMP-THUMP!* Louder. *THUMP-THUMP!* It wouldn’t stop.

I smiled wider. Spoke faster. Tried to drown it out. My voice rose in pitch. I gestured wildly. My hands shook. Still — the sound. *THUMP-THUMP! THUMP-THUMP!* It was no longer beneath the floor. It was inside my skull. Inside my soul. The very rhythm of guilt.

The officers didn’t notice. But I did. Every beat was a nail driven into my brain. Every second, a blade twisting in my chest. My vision swam. The room tilted. My mouth went dry.

And then — I snapped.

I leapt from my chair, eyes wide, breath ragged. I screamed. I could no longer hold it back.

“*STOP!*” I shrieked. “*Stop it! Don’t pretend you don’t hear it!*”

They looked at me, stunned. I pointed at the floor. My hands clawed at the boards.

“*It’s his heart!*” I cried. “*It’s still beating! I can’t take it anymore!*”

I tore at the wood with my bare hands, nails splintering, skin tearing, blood mixing with dust. “*There!*” I screamed, ripping open the truth. “*THERE! BENEATH YOU!*”

Letters and percentages invented, 

to keep kids motivated.

Students like me, 

they only give me dread.

Scribbling in bubbles,

writing short answers on lines,

and putting answers on a dime.

My one thought is–

what grade will be aftermath?

when test scores are so outdated,

But I still let them bleed through me.



The red mark of an F,

surely means I’ll be a drop out

And a failure by all means.

Forget my degree,

I’ll be on the path,

of mopping floors,

Never being truly set free. 



D and C

The troublemakers those letters cause.

Will I be able to pass the class?

Late night sessions,

With coffee in hand,

studying– 

no given pause,

until my vision is blurry, 

from the scanning of jumbled up words.



Incision in my eyes,

to open my mind…

and hurry along, 

to make me cry.



Here comes B,

Eighty percent and up.

I tell myself,

I should’ve studied harder,

To deem perfection. 

Telling myself I’m just dumb, 

Not understanding,

the numbness I’m in…

to please my low self esteem.



The grand A,

every student desires to see.

that higher score,

the brand everyone goes for.

It tells me what kind of genius I am,

giving me the tiny satisfaction 

which lasts for a day–

until the vicious cycle,

the action of self-loathing starts over again.

Even then, 

it feels like malice intent.



*Why do I care about these grades?*

I ask myself,

because of the empathized importance given to them,

when competency doesn't matter. 

And letters and percentage outshines personality.

I’ll keep playing the system, 

Tearing and wearing me down, 

driving me mad, 

about the grades.",1,1748567861.0,Poems,0,0.99,False
