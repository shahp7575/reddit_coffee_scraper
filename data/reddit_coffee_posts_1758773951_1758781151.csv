hey, posting here again.

about me: early 30s, working in tech in bangalore. quiet, low-drama guy who enjoys cafes, long walks, lazy sundays and real convos more than parties or small talk. into photography, 3d design and small web/homelab projects. i’ve spent the last few years focusing on skills and hobbies, so i’m new to dating but ready to try.

why i’m here: dating apps felt shallow and too hookup-heavy. most weekends i just end up scrolling, and i want to change that. i’m looking for something real, honest and slow-build.

what i’m like:

calm and thoughtful, listen more than i talk

loyal, not into drama

prefer 1 on 1 stuff: coffee/tea, parks, long walks, late night talks

creative and curious, like building/learning random skills


what i’m looking for: someone kind, emotionally mature and curious. more than that, i want a partner, not an echo.

on vibe: you don’t have to agree on everything to connect. a person is always bigger than one opinion. i value honesty and the freedom to be ourselves. i’ll respect your worldview and i’m looking for someone who’ll do the same.

if your instinct when you disagree is to shut down or dismiss, we won’t match. but if you can see the whole person and handle differences with curiosity instead of judgment, that’s what i’m after.

last thing: i’d rather hear “hey this isn’t a vibe” than deal with ghosting. clear and kind endings > confusion.

if this feels like your vibe, say hi and tell me one of these: fav cafe, ideal lazy weekend, or a song you can’t stop replaying. reply or dm, no pressure, no pics upfront.

Hope the dev can fix that, i think that can be the right moment to improve the game.

- sometimes u lose the weapon/item focus, even if It was selected.
- after the item's switch the item wasn't ready, even the animation was complete, so many death occur instead trying to healing yourself.
- sometimes the gun/weapon do not shoot/attack, even if you are really close to the enemy, (last night the double barrel shoot only one even if i long press the button to release all the ammo)

Here, instead, there are some tips who can improve the Gameplay experience.

- in the research table, do not share the item's already searched/learned (u can research it multiple times and waste featers)
- disable the projects already learned at the ""coffee machines"" (same problem)
- improve the text size, on bigger monitor It was very small, specially the numbers of the featers/requested item's on shop/creation page
- during the merchants trade trying to improve the UI, explain the difference between silver and featers (the alcool can be selled but i cannot find anyone who can buy it)
- personally i have problem to understand the physics during throwing granade/moltov, they stuck in the walls/doors/windows and the trajectory can't be understand. No Power during throw and the very high launch curve can't figure out were the object will be thrown. I'll understand that can be difficult, but this can be a game changer feature.

1npz5mh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientAstroVedic/comments/1npz5mh/everyone_is_manifesting_blindly_but_what_if_your/,Everyone is manifesting blindly. But what if your soul is already coded with what you must manifest...and when? Your Soul Planet in Vedic Astrology is the missing link between success and stuckness.,"Have You Found Your Soul Planet? Why You Feel Stuck in Life (and How to Unlock Your Purpose)

Most people look at their Sun sign or Moon sign...but Vedic Astrology goes deeper.
Hidden in your chart is your Soul Planet (Ātmakāraka)...the planet that carries your karmic lessons, your struggles, and ultimately… your true purpose of life.

Here’s the secret:
Your life only flows when your Soul Planet manifests during the period of your Benefit Planet (your strongest supportive planet). That’s when the universe aligns to push you toward your destiny.

But why do so many of us feel stuck?

Because we’re chasing careers, relationships, or goals that don’t align with our Soul Planet’s lesson.
 Because we ignore the planetary cycle that actually supports our growth.

For example:

If your Soul Planet is Saturn → your life purpose is discipline, persistence, and mastery. But unless your Benefit Planet (say Venus or Jupiter) activates, you’ll feel blocked no matter how hard you work.

If your Soul Planet is Venus → your purpose is relationships, beauty, harmony. But when Mars rules your period, you may feel restless, frustrated, or out of place.


The Key:

When you align your daily choices + career path + relationships with your Soul Planet’s purpose, and time them with your Benefit Planet’s activation, you stop feeling stuck. That’s when manifestations happen fast—wealth, love, recognition, peace.

 Why this matters now:

Whether you’re in Dubai, London, Singapore, New York, Zurich, India Amsterdam, Mumbai, Milan, or Kuwait City. The pressure of modern life is the same: chasing money, titles, and success, but still feeling empty.

Your chart already holds the map.
Your Soul Planet shows why you are here.
Your Benefit Planet shows when it will work out.

Why you should act now

Think of this as a monthly health check-up for your destiny.
You spend on shoes, coffee, dinners — but one chart reading can shift how you see your whole life.

 I am opening appointment slots for this week and next.

 For the next 3 hours, bookings are open.
If you’ve been waiting for a sign, this is it.

1npz4wy,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDUK/comments/1npz4wy/what_finally_worked_for_my_adhd_after_years_of/,What FINALLY worked for my ADHD after years of failed “hacks”,"I’ve had ADHD my whole life but only got diagnosed last year at 31. For years I tried every hyped-up productivity system, Pomodoro apps, bullet journals, “deep work” trackers, and failed so hard every time. Each failure made me feel broken. I wanted to share the random little shifts that finally clicked, just in case they help someone else too.

Body doubling was my first breakthrough. I started using Focusmate after hearing it on a podcast, and it blew my mind how 50 minutes with a silent stranger can keep me locked in better than any timer. Another game-changer was the “ugly first draft” rule. I literally tell myself I’m trying to write garbage, and somehow the perfectionism freeze disappears. Even deleting Instagram during the week made a bigger difference than all those fancy blocking apps, because reinstalling adds friction my brain hates.

When I dug into the science, I realized why these hacks worked. Andrew Huberman talks about how ADHD brains need external structure, light, movement, visible time. A quick 10-minute walk and then NSDR (non-sleep deep rest) primes my brain better than coffee. Russell Barkley’s research shows ADHD isn’t laziness but a need for scaffolds to externalize time and goals, which finally made sense of my late dx. That’s why I swapped endless to-do lists for time blocks I can move around. Even small sensory tweaks matter; gum plus a fidget toy gives my brain just enough extra stimulation to focus longer.

Resources that shaped me: ADHD 2.0 reframed my brain as different, not broken, it’s the best ADHD book I’ve ever read. Cal Newport’s Deep Work (NYT bestseller, insanely good read) made me rethink distraction, though I had to remix it into shorter sprints. Jessica McCabe’s How to ADHD YouTube channel felt like a survival guide made by someone who actually gets it. The Huberman Lab podcast gave me science-backed daily focus tools. A friend also put me on BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by a Columbia team. It turns books, research, and expert talks into podcasts you can tailor, choose 10, 20, or 40 minutes, even pick your host’s voice. Mine is a deep one like morgan freeman, and it learns from what I listen to and updates my learning plan. One episode combined ADHD 2.0, Huberman tips, and McCabe’s strategies into a morning plan I still use. And the Modern Wisdom podcast with Anna Lembke explained dopamine so clearly it finally made sense why doomscrolling fried my motivation.

The biggest shift wasn’t one single hack, it was realizing ADHD brains aren’t broken. We just need different inputs, structure, and learning loops. And daily reading and learning have been the only things that truly rewired me. Knowledge really does change everything.

I used ALL of my expensive creams today in contempt of my sadness, and in spite of my tears. I am not crying anymore today. I am going to do my damnedest to refuse this looming resurgence of darkness. 

The sun is still shining and while I may not be thriving, fuck, I'm still alive. Are there days that I don't want to be? Absolutely, I will never lie about that. But there are also days where the push back and determination to remain unmoved are somehow enough. 

I woke up so sad and I cried almost immediately, so I put on some sad songs and let my tears flow freely during my shower. There's nothing special about today, I just woke up this way. Funnily enough, it was something in the warmth and richness of my morning coffee that put some brightness in my day and helped push away a little bit of the shadow lingering around my heart. 

It really is the little things, y’know? Life is full of them. Little flowers and little daggers everywhere … I look back and think of how many times I believed myself to be running wild and free through a field of wildflowers only to realize that I was actually surrounded by flames. And I wasn't free at all, I was trapped. 

But not now … now I am free, nothing and no one holding me, nothing and no one wanting me. Truly … free … 

There are no wildflowers, though, not in this field that I find myself in. It's just shadows and swirling darkness. I'm alone here, too, but this place is familiar … I won't find happiness here, it can't exist here, nothing can, not even sadness. This place is just dark and empty. And that's why I like it here, because being in a place where I feel nothing also means being in a place where nothing hurts. 

It's a kind of peace, albeit not the peace I want, not the peace I'm looking for and working towards. I want the peace that comes out of love, not defeat. I want to love you so badly … but you won't let me. And it doesn't matter why, whether your reasons are truth or lies, all that matters is the love that you deny. There are times that I still feel yours, and it's the most amazing feeling, it's unlike anything I've ever felt before … and you have no idea how bad it hurts me and how low I fall when you take it away. 

Trying to stay strong in the face of all of this asks for a kind of brave that I'm not sure I am, and a kind of strength I don't think I have anymore … maybe I never did. I don't know what to do, because all I want is you. And I love you, in a way that I have never experienced love, the purest and most honest love that I have ever felt … and you don't even want it … 

I don't know how to make it stop. I keep feeling you and seeing signs but nothing makes sense because you keep going away. And I don't just mean the distance between us or your silence, it's something else entirely ... 

I'm taking the rest of the day off … I can't focus or concentrate on work, days like today the heaviness in my head and heart are just too much. Today's challenge will be simply sitting by the river, without wanting to drown myself in it. 

But I won't cry anymore today. The darkness can swirl and I'll stand in defiance of it. My light may be greatly diminished, it still flickers with a love that cannot be extinguished. Love is my only purpose, love is all there is. A good love, and a good heart … those are things to live for. And while I haven't experienced much return, I've still got a bit to share. 

If you ever change your mind … come find me.

But I see a lot of worry warts here and alternatively a lot of folk nonchalantly in a state that most would consider “critically ill.” Lol.  NFA, not life advice, not medical advice, not advice but just from personal anecdotal points I make and no one should follow:

-  if I have a weird ass symptom like when I first got spider web veins in my palms. I checked here vs google. Google says serious condition. Truth is, not great, doesn’t really mean much.


-  bowed fingernails, accordingly to google this is end stage shit. Truth is… again not good. But don’t effin panic unless you got lollipop fingers


-  neuropathy- mine is mild, extreeemly mild. The slightest tiny bit of two of my toes. Lost it fairly early into my years of what I’d consider CA status. Google says will only get worse, will lead to other issues. Me: nah, nothings changed. Scary at first but I still blame it drinking brooklyns tap water so much at the time. Started over 15 years ago no change.


-  vomiting/shitting blood - varices. / bile - I should’ve pointed out that not all of these should be completely discredited as worthy of care or consideration. You know your body better than anyone else and if somethin ain’t feel right or youre concerned always do right by you. Not totally belittling any of the symptoms as they *could* be serious, but again: GOOGLE: Emergency room necessary. You’ll bleed out. Welp bitch if that’s the case I’ve been bleeding for 9 years.


-   Abdomen or stomach pain.   There is a very very very quick and very obvious difference in the pain involved when there’s the dull left side constant “pain” vs when your hurdled over. You’ll know the difference and you’ll be praying for the hospital vs even questioning it. Same goes with the visibly larger liver area. Yeah, get used to it! Could be fatty liver could be your genes that youre not completely symmetrical.


Things to do and have always scared me:

Jaundice: I used to regularly use the extra red eye solution then check the corners for yella.

Coffee grounds.


Shaking so bad I seize at work/with family.


And that was pretty much it. I’m not anti getting checked out or anti dr. If youre concerned and have the ability please ease your anxiety and do so. But for those who are constantly worried ah fuck is this this or did I fuck myself permanently…. more likely than not your good. There’s stories all over the spectrum and  I’d hope it helps calms your nerves. I’d trust another stranger’s anecdotal account/story here before I’d trust any where else tbh. With a grain o sal but yeah. Sit back, breathe, and accept that life will be life and all will be okay. Fuck the anxiety even for 5-10 seconds if you can

So, I went on the date on Monday evening. I wore a shirt, pants, and sneakers, kept it simple and skipped the flowers. She arrived a bit late but greeted me warmly with a hug and a cheek kiss, apologising for the delay.

We grabbed coffee and pizza, then took a walk in the nearby park. The date ended up lasting almost three hours, and we covered a wide range of topics, avoiding anything too controversial. As the conversation unfolded, I began to notice some significant cultural differences and a fundamental mismatch in our worldviews. I think she sensed it, too.

We wrapped up the date together, and she suggested a second one. I politely dodged it by mentioning a busy schedule. We’ve exchanged a few texts since, but the energy has faded, and it’s clear to both of us that the connection didn’t quite click.",6,1758779943.0,AskAnAustralian,7,0.8,False

1npyymr,https://www.reddit.com/r/AtHomeEssentials/comments/1npyymr/how_does_a_garage_heater_perform_in_windy_areas/,How does a garage heater perform in windy areas?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience with garage heaters, specifically how they handle windy conditions. I've lived in some pretty gusty areas, and I know the struggle of trying to keep a garage warm when the wind is howling outside.

First off, I recently got an electric garage heater from https://athometouch.com/garage-heater and it's been a game-changer. The thing about garage heaters in windy areas is that you need to consider both the unit's power and your garage's insulation. I learned this the hard way after freezing my butt off trying to work on my car last winter.

Here's what I've discovered about garage heater performance in windy conditions:

1. Sealed garages work best - Even the most powerful heater won't help much if wind is sneaking in through gaps. I spent a weekend weather-stripping my garage door and sealing obvious gaps, and it made a huge difference.

2. Mounting location matters - I mounted mine on the wall opposite to where I usually work. This creates better air circulation and prevents cold spots. Some people prefer ceiling mounts, but I found wall mounting works better in windy conditions.

3. Size matters (seriously) - Don't cheap out on a small unit thinking it'll do the job. My first heater was undersized, and it struggled constantly. The current one I got from https://athometouch.com/garage-heater is properly sized for my space, and it maintains temperature even when it's super windy outside.

4. Supplemental insulation helps - I added some basic insulation to my garage walls and it dramatically improved the heater's performance. It's like giving your heater a fighting chance against the wind.

5. Warm-up time - Give your heater about 30-45 minutes to warm up the space before you start working. This creates a nice heat buffer that helps maintain temperature when wind picks up.

A quick pro tip: I installed a basic thermometer on different walls to track temperature distribution. This helped me optimize the heater's position and identify problem areas where wind was affecting performance.

Here's what surprised me: even on super windy days, a properly installed garage heater maintains pretty consistent temperatures. The key is creating that sealed envelope in your garage. Think of it like a coffee thermos - it doesn't matter how cold and windy it is outside if the container is well-insulated.

For those wondering about running costs - I tracked my electricity usage, and it's actually not as bad as I expected. The initial investment in a good unit and proper insulation pays off in the long run through better efficiency.

I hope this helps anyone considering a garage heater in a windy area. Feel free to ask any questions - I've probably made all the rookie mistakes already and learned from them!",1,1758779837.0,AtHomeEssentials,0,1.0,False

The space feels like a haven for music lovers, artists, members of the LGBTQ community and allies. It's part café, part creative hub. You’ll find amazing themed decor, nods to inspirational musicians across genres and generations, and a super welcoming vibe. Plus, the coffee is Intelligentsia (so you know it’s good) and their food + drinks menu is delicious (go for the turkey wrap & Fade Into You).

It’s the kind of place you can grab a coffee, soak in the atmosphere, and feel like you’re part of something bigger than just a coffee stop. If you’re into music, community spaces, or just a great café experience, this one’s worth adding to your list when in LA/West Hollywood!

Tristan Blackwood was Blackwood Pack's top Alpha. Tall, powerfully built, with a skull tattoo sprawled across his chest, he radiated an aura that could freeze blood.

No one knew the truth. No one knew these two apex Alphas were locked in a desperate, breathless embrace in the back of a carriage, late into the night. No one saw them savagely tangled on a banquet balcony. Or heard them making love recklessly behind a cellar door.

After another climax, the shower began to hiss from the bathroom.

Sienna propped herself up against the headboard, mind—linked her father.

""I'll take that dying Alpha from Stormcrest Pack as my mate,"" she said,""but I have one condition.""

Her father's eager growl vibrated through the link.""Speak! Become his mate, and anything you ask is yours.""

""I'll explain everything when I'm home."" Her voice was honey—smooth, but her eyes were winter—cold

Sienna severed the link. As she moved to dress, a faint glow caught her eye—Tristan's Comm Stone flickering on the nightstand.

Once the white glow faded, a delicate, fragile voice rang out.

【Tris, it's thundering, and I'm so scared...】

""Ugh, that voice is disgusting!"" Elara, her wolf, shuddered violently in Sienna's mind, her tone dripping with disdain.

Sienna's fingertips trembled. She lowered her gaze, remembering the person behind the voice.

It was Lillian Fairchild, the Omega.

The bathroom door suddenly opened, and Tristan walked out.

Water dripped along his collarbone, his shirt casually undone at the top, radiating a lazy, dangerous charm.

""Pack business. Gotta go."" He grabbed his jacket, his voice still cool and detached.

Sienna's red lips curved into a subtle smirk.""Pack business, huh? Or are you just rushing off to see your little first love?""

Tristan didn't quite catch it.""What?""

""Nothing,"" she said, getting out of bed. Her bare feet sank into the soft carpet.

His eyes flickered darker, thumb lingering on her swollen lips.""Be good. Don't cause trouble.""

The moment the door clicked shut, the smile dropped from Sienna's face.

She called for a carriage and followed him.

Half an hour later, the carriage pulled up in front of an Inn. Through the curtain of rain, Sienna watched Lillian sprint out of the entrance in a white dress.

Tristan rushed over, shrugging off his jacket to drape it over her shoulders before sweeping her up into his arms.

""It's freezing out here. Why are you out with barely anything on, huh?""

His movements were so practiced, like he'd rehearsed them a thousand times.

Sienna clenched her fists, her nails digging deep into her palms.

Elara snarled, her voice thick with fury,""That annoying idiot wolf! I knew he was no good!""

""Elara."" Sienna called her calmly, appearing not to be angry at all.

She watched Tristan gently carry Lillian into the inn, and for some reason, she suddenly remembered the first time she'd seen him.

Back then, she and her father, Victor Roth, were constantly clashing. After she'd cracked his head open one too many times, he sent her to live with his best friend's son to discipline her, saying he needed to curb her spoiled ways.

The first time they met, Tristan was sitting in the great hall of the Blackwood Pack manor, his gaze behind his glasses as cold as ice.

Even though she felt the Moon Goddess's arrangement, her heart instantly quickened, and her blood boiled.

Elara's voice, a low growl, echoed in Sienna's mind:""He's the mate!""

But she still didn't want to be there.

So she found every possible way to mess with him.

The very first day they met, she spilled wine all over his expensive suit.

Tristan just gave her a cool look.""That's unicorn down,"" he said,""send the bill to Roth Pack.""

The next day, she deliberately fed the intel Gamma had brought into the shredder. Tristan didn’t bat an eye; he recited every detail from memory on the spot, stunning all the elders in the conference room.

The third day, she drugged his wine and set up the Memory Crystal, planning to catch him in a compromising state and blackmail him.

But it ended up acting as his antidote instead.

The next morning, her whole body ached, and Sienna was furious enough to kill. Yet Tristan pinned her against the window and F**Ked her again.

""Rory,"" he rasped, nipping at her earlobe,""Be a good girl.""

Just that one word,""Rory,"" completely broke her.

No one had called her that in ages, not since her mom passed away.

From then on, everything between them changed.

Every time she acted out, Tristan would just haul her into the conference room. Outsiders thought he was gonna lay down the law, but really, he'd pin her against the desk and F**Ked her until her legs turned to jelly.

Slowly, she found herself developing a real taste for it.

Was it because he was so good in bed? Or was it just because she was so damn lonely?

She didn't know.

All she knew was that she'd fallen into his hands—just as destiny intended.

But Elara was growing to dislike him more and more.

She found him fake and arrogant.

In short, he was everything a wolf shouldn't be—totally unlikable!

Elara had begged her over and over to reject Tristan as her mate.

But Sienna never listened, not once. In fact, on his birthday, she spent an entire day decorating the Manor.

Roses, candlelight, music—she even had the ritual materials for a blood oath ready.

She wanted to become his true mate that night, to become the Luna of Blackwood Pack.

But Sienna waited all night. The candles burned down, the roses withered, and he never showed.

It wasn't until 3 AM that she heard wolves talking outside, their voices filled with surprise—

""Moon Goddess, bless us, our Alpha actually picked up an Omega late at night.""

""No way, seriously?""

That wolf didn't quite believe it, her tone laced with suspicion.

""Of course, it's true!"" The first werewolf to speak nodded furiously and pulled out a Memory Crystal from his pocket to show her.

Sienna pressed herself against the window, and a flash of white light later, a scene played out inside the Memory Crystal.

Tristan was carefully escorting a girl in a white dress into a carriage, his gaze blindingly tender.

The two wolves exploded:

""OMG, an Alpha and an Omega, they look so perfect together!""

""Our Alpha and this Omega have known each other for ages! Back in the day, they were the absolute stars of Lunaris Academy!""

""I remember! The Alpha was always ice—cold to everyone, but he'd actually smile at Lillian! If she hadn't gotten sick and gone to another pack for treatment, they'd totally be mates by now, right?""

The rose dropped to the floor.

Sienna couldn't believe her eyes.

If Tristan already had someone in his heart, then what was she?

Just a convenient hookup?

Trembling, she connected to Tristan's Comm Stone, desperate for an answer, but it kept failing to connect.

After the last failed attempt, Sienna put down the Comm Stone and walked into Tristan's study—a room he never let her enter.

The moment she pushed the door open, she froze, as if struck by lightning—

It was filled with images of Lillian.

There were graduation photos, travel photos, and even creepy candid shots of Lillian sleeping.

Tristan, who was always so cool and self—possessed, was actually capable of something like this.

""Ha! I knew it!"" Elara couldn't hold back, she burst out of Sienna, latching onto one of the Memory Crystals, and with a furious bite, crunched it to dust.

""I told you, Tristan isn't good mate! I'd rather black out from the pain of rejecting him as my mate than ever live with him!""

Elara, in a fit of pure rage, started tearing through the study.

Sienna just stood there, still reeling from the revelation that he was in love with his first love.

Elara tackled her to the ground, snarling low,""Sienna, what are you even thinking about? You're not actually still gonna make him your mate, are you, are you?""

""No. Not anymore."" Sienna suddenly laughed, the sound sharp and hollow in the empty room.

""I've given up.""

But as she laughed, hot tears streamed from her eyes, tracing paths down her delicate jawline and splattering onto the floor.

And then, red—eyed, she and Elara proceeded to tear apart the entire Manor.

The next day, when Tristan returned, he just calmly told his staff to clean up the utter devastation.

He didn't even spare her a glance, as if her trashing the place was just another Tuesday.

Sienna watched, numb, as the staff swept away the Blood Oath Parchment she had so painstakingly prepared, treating it like nothing but trash.

He had no idea what was in that box.

He didn't know she'd wanted to be his Luna, to spend the rest of her life by his side.

What he really didn't know was that the moment those precious items were swept into the trash, she decided to defy the Moon Goddess's will.

She was going to reject him as her mate.

""Princess, where are you headed?"" The driver's voice jolted her back to reality.

""Home,"" Sienna said, opening her eyes. Her voice was icy cold.""Back to Roth Pack.""

Back at the Roth Pack Manor, her father immediately rushed to meet her.""Rory, is it true you're willing to go to the Stormcrest Pack?""

On the stairs, her father's new Luna also watched her with hopeful eyes.

""It is,"" Sienna replied, a chill entering her gaze.""But didn't I say there was a condition?""

""What is it? Spill it!""

""I want to... cut ties with you,"" Sienna said, enunciating each word.

The air in the room instantly thickened.

Victor's face contorted.""Are you insane?! Do you know what you're saying?!""

""Couldn't be clearer.""

Sienna's voice was like ice.""You cheated on Mom, and to make way for that Omega, you pushed her to her death. From that day on, I swore I'd never call you my father.""

She stared at Victor's ashen face.""Now, that dying Alpha from the Stormcrest Pack put a bounty of fifty billion make me his mate, and you've been hounding me for three months. If I didn't agree, you were just going to tie me up and drag me there, weren't you?""

""So what's the difference if we cut ties or not?""

She curled her lips into a mocking smirk.""Perfect, just bring your mistress's daughter home and let an Omega be Roth Pack's heir.""

Victor was shaking with rage.""Fine! Cut ties then! But that Alpha from the Stormcrest Pack supposedly won't live past the end of the month. You have to go before then!""

He sneered.""The new Luna's daughter actually came back from another pack a couple of days ago. She's been staying at the Inn. Since you're so eager to step aside, she'll move in tomorrow!""

Sienna let out a laugh, her heart aching.""So eager to raise someone else's kid, completely ignoring your own daughter. You're truly one of a kind, aren't you?""

She turned to leave, but Luna Fairchild, feigning concern, blocked her path and said,""Rory, how can you talk to your father like that?""

Sienna stopped dead in her tracks.

She slowly turned around, years of suppressed hatred churning in her eyes.""What? You think once I'm out of this house, you can finally act like the Luna around here?""

She closed in.""Serena Fairchild, listen up. My mom died. That doesn't change the fact you're a homewrecker—and everyone knows it. And your precious daughter? Even if she becomes the Roths' little princess, it won't wipe off the stain of having a homewrecker for a mother.""

Serena's face instantly went pale, and she staggered back two steps.

Sienna turned on her heel and stormed out, every single step feeling like she was treading on broken glass.

It wasn't until she was back in her room, the door slammed shut, that she slid to the floor, as if all her strength had been sucked out of her, burying her face deep in her knees.

Early the next morning, a cacophony of moving furniture and cheerful chatter drifted up from downstairs.

""What the hell is going on?"" She flung her door open.""Are you seriously not letting anyone sleep around here?""

The butler stammered,""Princess... Miss Lily... she's moved in...""

Before the butler even finished speaking, a familiar figure appeared at the top of the stairs—

Lillian stood there, dressed in a pristine white dress, looking every bit the picture of delicate innocence.

Sienna's blood ran cold!

2

Sienna had never in a million years imagined that Serena's daughter, the one who'd supposedly been ""recuperating"" in another pack for years, was actually Tristan's first love.

The Moon Goddess, was truly playing a cruel joke on her.

In the next instant, Lillian walked towards her, a sweet smile gracing her lips.""Oh, Sis, I'm so sorry,"" she cooed,""Did we disturb you...?""

Sienna slammed the door shut with a bang, cutting her off mid—sentence.

""Sienna! Have you no manners?!""

Victor roared from outside,""Empty your room! Lily likes it, so it's hers now!""

Sienna just scoffed, stalked to her closet, and started packing.

Snatches of conversation drifted in from outside the door—

""Uncle Roth, is Sienna mad?"" Lillian's voice was so sweet it could make your teeth ache.

""Don't mind her. She's been spoiled rotten since she was a kid.""

""But...""

""Don't worry, she'll be married off to the Stormcrest Pack soon. Then this home will be just for you and Serena.""

Sienna's hand froze for a beat, then her sneer deepened.

""They seriously suck!"" Elara snarled, her claws scraping restlessly inside Sienna's mind.

Sienna nodded.""Damn right!""

Without hesitation, she booked a carriage for the Stormcrest Pack at the end of the month, then went back to packing.

Half an hour later, she dragged her luggage out of the room.

In the living room, Victor, Serena, and Lillian were chatting on the couch, fruit and pastries laid out on the coffee table. They looked like a picture—perfect family.

Sienna walked past them without so much as a glance.

""Stop!"" Victor snapped, his voice sharp.""Where are you going? Don't forget what you promised!""

""Don't worry, I always keep my promises."" Sienna didn't even turn around.""I just can't stomach being here for the next two weeks.""

She headed straight to the most luxurious inn in the whole pack, and checked into a deluxe suite.

For the next few days, Sienna went on a wild shopping spree.

She bought the most extravagant wedding gown and splurged a fortune at the Lunar Auction, snagging antique jewelry for her dowry.

Even if she was being forced into this marriage, she was going to go out with a bang.

Her Comm Stone had been buzzing non—stop in her bag, but Sienna didn't check it until she'd bought the last diamond necklace.

Thirty—eight messages. All from her dad.

The moment she answered, her father's roar blasted through the Comm Stone:""Are you out of your mind?! Three billion dollars in one day! Are you trying to bankrupt our pack?!""

""Don't worry!""

Sienna scoffed,""Once I'm with the Stormcrest Pack's Alpha, you'll have fifty billion coming in.""

""But that money isn't in yet! If you keep blowing through cash like this, our pack'll be bankrupt by tomorrow!""

Sienna just smirked.

She intended for his pack to crumble, utterly.

As for the pack members after it disbanded, she'd take them in. But him and those two bitches? She'd never let them set foot near her!

And the fifty billion dollars promised by the Stormcrest Pack? She already had plans for that too.

Once she was there, she'd make sure the Storm family handed it directly to her.

Then she'd watch and see if Lillian and her stepmother would still cling to a penniless old Alpha, ending up as rogues themselves.

Did they seriously think everyone was as naive as her own mother?

She'd stuck by an Alpha through thick and thin, built an empire from nothing, worked herself half to death—coughing up blood, landing in the hospital—only to be driven to her grave in the end.

The thought of her mother sent a stabbing pain through Sienna's chest.

Her Comm Stone buzzed again. A text from Tristan popped up:[What's with the dramatics? Why aren't you here today?]

Sienna just stared at the message.

For the past year, because Tristan had been 'disciplining her,' she had to report to his pack nearly every day, on the dot.

But now she was about to marry into the Stormcrest Pack, what was the point of him trying to 'discipline' her?

Loaded down with over a dozen shopping bags, she got back to the Inn, only to find her luggage piled up in the lobby.

""What the hell is this?"" she demanded, her voice icy.

The desk clerk stammered awkwardly,""Ms. Roth, your funds have been depleted... and according to hotel policy...""

Just then, her Comm Stone flashed. A message from her father, Victor, popped up:[If you want to cut ties, don't use my money. I've frozen all your accounts.]

Sienna stared at the message for a long time, until her eyes burned.

Finally, she only replied with one word:[Fine.]

Sienna trudged down the street, dragging her luggage.

The carriage wasn't coming until the end of the month, and now she had nowhere to go.

Where was she supposed to live for the next two weeks? What would she eat? What would she use?

Her bags were packed with wedding dresses and jewelry, none of which she could sell. As for borrowing money...

She'd rather sleep on the street than stoop to begging those wolves in the pack who were just waiting for a laugh.

The nearby riverside bench looked somewhat usable for a nap. Sienna had just set down her luggage when a drunken, unattached werewolf stumbled over.

""Hey, gorgeous, all by yourself?""

""Get lost!""

""Why so feisty? Come on, have some fun with me...""

The man's greasy hand landed on her shoulder, and Sienna instantly raised her hand to slap him—

""Ah!!""

A scream ripped through the air.

Tristan appeared out of nowhere, twisting the wolf's wrist with a single swift motion.

Before Sienna could even react, she was yanked into the carriage, luggage and all.

""Let go of me!""

Tristan clamped down on her thrashing wrists.""What's the drama this time?""

His voice was low.""Homeless, and you still wouldn't come to me?""

3

That line hit Sienna right in the feels.

Back then, whenever she ran off after a fight with her dad, Tristan would chase her across the pack lands and carry her home on his back.

""What are you stirring up now?"" He'd always say that back then, too.

She'd be sprawled on his back, inhaling the crisp cedar scent of him, naively believing he might actually like her a little.

Now? Thinking back—

No one's a bigger dirtbag than him!

He didn't even like her—but still slept with her.

And after, he'd go back to his study, gazing at Lillian's photo like she was the love of his life.

She just didn't get it. What did she lack compared to that Omega, Lillian?

Status, looks, body—what did she lack?

Out of everyone in the world, why her? Why did it have to be Lillian?

""Let go!"" Sienna's eyes were blazing as she bit down hard on Tristan's hand.

The Alpha just frowned, not saying a word. He drove the carriage straight back to the Manor, carrying her bags right through the door.

""Same as always.""

He unbuttoned his cuffs, tone final.""Stay as long as you want.""

Sienna stood in the entryway, her nails digging into her palms.""I'll only stay for two weeks. After that, I'm out. I'll pay you rent, and I won't bother you again.""

""Won't bother me again?""

Tristan met her gaze, eyes dark behind his glasses.""You really think you can do that?""

His words twisted like a knife in her gut, making Sienna's heart clench painfully.

Elara scoffed.""He saw right through you. He knows you're head over heels for him, that you can't live without him.""

""How could the Moon Goddess let such a hypocritical, arrogant jerk be your mate?"" Elara sneered.""I'm ashamed for it!""

Sienna ignored Elara's words, her gaze still fixed on Tristan.

She was madly in love with him.

But him?

He loved someone else, and still just stood by, watching her fall apart?

* **Faster Response:** By excluding non-organic elements, the API processes requests more quickly.
* **Structured Data:** Receive results in a clean JSON format, including title, link, and snippet.

# 🧪 How to Use It:

To fetch 100 results for a query (e.g., ""coffee""):

    https://serpapi.com/search.json?engine=google_light_fast&q=coffee&api_key=YOUR_API_KEY
    

Replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual SerpApi key and adjust the query (`q`) as needed. You can test this directly in the SerpApi Playground.

# 🔄 Handling Rich Results:

If you require additional data like knowledge graphs, ads, or People Also Ask sections, you can still use the standard Google Search API. Simply make a separate request to gather these rich results.

# ✅ Why It Matters:

With Google's recent changes, many SEO professionals and researchers faced challenges in collecting comprehensive search data. The Google Light Fast API addresses this gap, providing a reliable solution for obtaining extensive organic search results efficiently.

Hong Kong’s Cyberport quietly testing mainland Chinese GPUs is the startup-world equivalent of switching from expensive artisanal coffee to instant when the rent hits. It’s pragmatic, a little resentful, and undeniably adult.

Why this matters beyond signal‑flavored headlines: the AI stack is no longer purely technical — it’s a supply chain with diplomatic relations. If your model training depends on a single vendor that lives under a sanctions/ export‑control storm cloud, your production plan isn’t a risk mitigation strategy, it’s a prayer.

Meanwhile, opinion pieces keep arguing whether the US and China can talk about AI without turning into a shouting match or a Netflix limited series. The compromise being floated is the least sexy kind: norms, incident reporting, maybe shared benchmarks. Think of it as “diplomacy light” — low commitment, plausible deniability, and enough bureaucracy to feel meaningful.

And then there’s the ceremonial bit: top AI CEOs jetting into the UK during a state visit to announce multibillion-pound data centres and partnerships. To the public it looks like investment and sovereignty; to the cynical oracle in the room it looks like a strategic PR pivot where private cloud meets public theater. Both readings are true.

For founders and indie hackers, this trifecta means three practical moves:

- Design for portability. Train with abstractions that let you switch accelerators without breaking production. Model format lock‑in is the new vendor lock‑in.
- Watch policy as an operational metric. Export controls, data residency rules, and “strategic investment” headlines must go into your product roadmap.
- Treat infrastructure announcements as a market signal, not a business plan. Big names and big money open opportunities — and competition for talent, power, and grid access.

This era rewards people who build adapters: software that moves models between runtimes, businesses that invest in multi‑cloud, and consultants who can translate legalese into deployable checklists. The rest will debug geopolitics in production.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you're considering a spacious yet functional living space, a barndominium with five bedrooms could be the perfect choice. These unique homes blend rustic charm with modern design, and they offer plenty of opportunities to maximize space and functionality. Let's explore creative ideas to make your 5-bedroom barndominium truly shine.

Begin by conceptualizing your layout. An open-concept floor plan can create a seamless flow between living spaces while making the area feel larger. By eliminating unnecessary walls, you can encourage a sense of togetherness and provide ample room for family or guests. Think about the arrangement of common areas like the kitchen, living room, and dining room adjacent to one another, allowing for easy interaction.

**Functional Zones**

- **Living Area:** Install large windows to bring in natural light. Consider a cozy seating arrangement with a sectional couch, creating a welcoming atmosphere.
- **Kitchen:** Design a kitchen island that doubles as a dining space. This feature optimizes functionality and helps you maximize space without needing a separate dining room.
- **Multi-Purpose Room:** Dedicate one bedroom as a multi-purpose space. This room can serve as a guest room, office, or playroom. Look into foldable furniture or Murphy beds to make the most of the available area.

The right storage solutions can enhance the utility of your barndominium. Consider built-in shelves, cabinets, and closets in each bedroom to keep your space organized. Additionally, under-bed storage can be a game changer, providing hidden space for seasonal items or extra bedding.

Another smart design element is the creation of interconnected bathrooms. If each bedroom has direct access to a bathroom, it elevates convenience for everyone in the house. When bathrooms are designed efficiently, they can include features like dual sinks or a sectioned-off toilet area to enhance privacy.

**Outdoor Access and Utility**

For families, outdoor space can be as crucial as interior space. Incorporate patios or decks that connect to common areas. This can extend your living space and serve as an outdoor entertainment hub or quiet retreat.

Consider creating a mudroom entryway to keep your home clean and organized. This area is ideal for storing shoes, coats, and bags, and can include lockers or cubbies for each family member. A dedicated laundry room nearby can also streamline household chores without infringing on your living area.

**Creative Design Elements**

- **Porches and Balconies:** Adding a porch or balcony to the master suite provides an inviting personal space to relax. Enjoy your morning coffee or unwind in the evenings.
- **Natural Materials:** Utilize wood and stone for a rustic feel. Exposed beams or brick accents can enhance the charm of your barndominium.
- **Color Scheme:** Opt for light, neutral colors to make your space feel more expansive. Consider pops of color in décor or accent walls for a modern touch.

Also, think about the efficiency of your layout in terms of energy usage. For instance, consider positioning utility rooms and bathrooms near each other to minimize plumbing costs. Wrap-around insulation will also help with heating and cooling, reducing long-term expenses.

Accessibility is another key aspect to consider while designing your barndominium. wide hallways and doorways will accommodate mobility devices while making it easier for everyone to navigate the home comfortably.

The final touch is landscaping. Surround your barndominium with trees, greenery, or a well-maintained garden to complement your living space. Not only does this create a serene environment, but it also provides privacy from neighbors.

All in all, designing a 5-bedroom barndominium is about creativity and efficient use of space. By utilizing open layouts, multi-functional areas, and thoughtful storage solutions, your barndominium can become a comfortable and functional haven for your family. Whether you're entertaining guests or enjoying a quiet night at home, these design strategies ensure that your living space is maximized for both comfort and style.

The Benefits of Choosing Barndominiums for Spacious Family Living
-----------------------------------------------------------------

More families are discovering the charm and functionality of barndominiums, especially when they need ample space for comfortable living. These unique dwellings blend traditional barn aesthetics with modern amenities, offering homeowners a variety of benefits. As you consider transforming your living space, barndominiums can be an ideal choice for spacious family living.

### Versatile Floor Plans

One of the primary advantages of barndominiums is the flexibility in floor plans. You can easily customize layouts to fit your family's specific needs. Options for 5-bedroom barndominium floor plans are particularly enticing for larger families, as they provide room to grow.

- Open-concept living areas allow for family gatherings and entertaining.
- Separate bedrooms ensure privacy for everyone, including kids and guests.
- Designs often include additional spaces that can serve as home offices, playrooms, or gyms.

### Spacious Living with High Ceilings

Barndominiums often feature high ceilings, which create a sense of openness and tranquility. This architectural style not only enhances the aesthetic appeal but also makes interiors feel expansive.

- High ceilings improve airflow, making the space feel less cramped.
- Natural light can flood in, brightening your living spaces and reducing the need for artificial lighting.
- For families with children, more vertical space means more room for creativity, like building lofted areas for play.

### Cost-Effective Construction

Building a barndominium can be more economical than traditional homes. The construction often involves less expensive materials and simplified building processes, making it easier to stick to a budget.

- Metal can be significantly cheaper than lumber over time due to durability.
- Lower maintenance costs mean you’ll save money in the long run.
- Energy-efficient designs often result in lower utility bills.

### Environmentally Friendly Options

Choosing a barndominium can also align with a more sustainable lifestyle. Many builders are embracing eco-friendly materials and practices in their designs, which is a huge plus for families looking to minimize their environmental footprint.

- Using reclaimed materials can reduce waste and overall impact on the environment.
- green technologies, such as solar panels, can lead to significant energy savings.
- Efficient insulation in barndominiums can maintain comfortable temperatures year-round, reducing energy consumption.

### Customizable Aesthetic

Barndominiums present a unique opportunity to express your personal style. With their rustic charm, you can easily customize both the exterior and interior finishes. This flexibility allows you to create a welcoming home that reflects your family’s personality.

- Mix modern and rustic elements for a cozy yet stylish vibe.
- Select from various siding options, including wood, metal, or a combination of both.
- Interior layouts can showcase open spaces, bold colors, or natural wood finishes.

### Community and Land Opportunities

When you choose a barndominium, you often have the option to build on larger plots of land. This can provide opportunities for farming, gardening, or even just enjoying more outdoor space for your kids to play and explore.

- Larger land plots can promote a sense of community with neighbors while still offering privacy.
- Outdoor living areas can become extensions of your home for barbecues, social gatherings, or peaceful retreats.
- Space for hobbies such as gardening, raising livestock, or recreational activities adds additional value.

Barndominiums provide a wealth of benefits for families seeking spacious living options. With their flexible designs, cost-effectiveness, customizable aesthetics, and environmental advantages, it’s no wonder they are gaining popularity. If you’re considering a new home, a barndominium might just be the perfect fit for your family’s needs.

### Conclusion

When considering your dream home, 5-bedroom barndominium floor plans uniquely blend rustic charm with modern living. By maximizing space and functionality, these designs allow you to tailor your home to the needs of your family while promoting a comfortable and inviting atmosphere.

I've been on a mission to step up my coffee game lately, and I wanted to share my journey of finding the perfect coffee grinder. After weeks of research and testing different options, I think I've finally found a winner.

I used to buy pre-ground coffee (I know, I know), but once I started grinding my own beans, there was no going back. The difference in taste is just mind-blowing. Fresh ground coffee has this incredible aroma and flavor that you just can't get from store-bought ground coffee.

Initially, I was overwhelmed by all the options out there - blade grinders, burr grinders, manual, electric, conical, flat... it's a lot to take in. But after diving deep into coffee forums and watching countless reviews, I discovered this amazing collection of coffee grinders that really stood out: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder

What I love about these grinders is how they cater to different needs. Whether you're into espresso, French press, or drip coffee, there's something for everyone. The burr grinders especially caught my attention because they give you consistent grounds, which is super important for getting that perfect cup every time.

Here's what I learned to look for in a good coffee grinder:
- Grind consistency
- Noise level (trust me, this matters if you're grinding early morning)
- Easy cleaning (some are a real pain to maintain)
- Multiple grind settings
- Build quality
- Price point

I personally went with a burr grinder from this collection: https://athometouch.com/coffee-grinder and I couldn't be happier. It's been three months now, and my morning coffee routine has completely transformed. The grinder is quiet, reliable, and gives me perfectly ground coffee every single time.

For beginners, I'd recommend starting with a mid-range electric burr grinder. It's a good balance between quality and price, and it'll last you years if you take care of it properly. Plus, most of them come with multiple grind settings, so you can experiment with different brewing methods.

Remember, investing in a good grinder is just as important as buying quality beans. You could have the most expensive coffee beans in the world, but if your grinder isn't up to par, you won't get the best out of them.

Hope this helps anyone who's looking to upgrade their coffee game! Feel free to ask any questions - I've become quite the coffee grinder enthusiast lately!",1,1758778674.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

#SUMMARY
*****
#Year One


- 1 - **Phoenix** is 2 weeks over her due date and in the Remand infirmary when her contractions start. At 5am the other women wake and the guard Henriette is called. She has to wait for the nurse to arrive at 7am and check her. Phoenix walks as long as she can manage between contractions. Later at the hospital she gets an epidural and sleeps until it is time to push. She wants to hold the baby in, but her body knows what needs to be done and even though she can't feel anything she pushes, and he is born. 8lbs 6oz (about 3.8kg) she calls him Sparrow. The Social Worker arrives and takes the baby. Jesse, Spencer's mom, has come to pick up the baby. She wants to adopt him asap. Phoenix is returned to the Remand infirmary like nothing happened, and 3 days later she was transferred to youth detention. She's to be tried as a minor and will be out in 3 years max **if** she can behave. When she arrives Dez is there, but the other girls have gotten a suspended sentence (and a beat down on the outside). Dez's priors means things are taking longer for her. Phoenix eats her dinner and as they go to leave she jumps Dez, who insists she didn't rat. Phoenix is back in solitary (or the Special Needs Unit)


- 2 - **Cedar** is in monitored visitation with her Mama - the first in a year - and struggling to be excited about Phoenix's baby that got taken away, because she knows she'l never meet him. The baby is named Sparrow after their little sister who died. Her Mama is antsy and it's making her nervous. She leaves to get a coffee and Cedar reflects on visitations when she and her sisters had first gone in to care. Mama was sober, and Sparrow was alive, and Phoenix used to hug her tight. The social worker and her mother drop news on her that her dad is out of prison, is married, and has gotten his life together. He has been approved for custody of her. She'll be going back to her foster *place* with Luiza for now but moving in with her new family (incl. step sister) before school starts in a few weeks. She doesn't even know her dad's name. Shawn is a stranger to her. She and Mama say a teary goodbye. On the drive back Cedar contemplates all the places she's lived over the years. She asks Chelsea (her Respite worker) to take her to the library on Saturday. Back at the foster place Cedar overhears Luiza's daughter begging her mother to give up fostering and move in with her to look after her own grandchildren. Maria criticizes Cedar and her family and that makes Cedar mad. Cedar daydreams about running away, but thinks how she is not brave enough...


- 3 - **Elsie** has left Jimmy and is working on getting clean. She's waiting for the anti-depressants to kick in and has been to the methadone clinc. She is staying with her Uncle Toby. This is the longest she's gone without using since before Sparrow died. After her last visit with Phoenix (that those of us who read The Break >!will remember this from the end of that book!<) Elsie spiralled until one day she woke up from a bender in a pool of piss. Elsie sits on a park bench in the heat smoking bummed cigarettes, and trying not to let her thoughts spiral out. As she walks past a bar a man outside waves her in, and supplies her with drinks and smokes till the bar begins to fill up and Elsie leaves. She doesn't know his name, but he knows her whole family. She walks to her local where she spends her last $5 on a beer in the hopes that telling everyone she's become a Grandma might result in some free drinks. Jimmy and Val (her on again off again ex of 5 years and her ex bezzie) are there, and the dutch courage makes Elsie approach them. Val buys the rounds and they soon become friends again.....until they are not. Elsie and Jimmy hugging almost kiss and Val throws her to the ground. Back at Uncle Toby's he rolls her cigarettes in the dark while she cries. She falls asleep thinking about her children and how worthless she is.


- 4 - **Margaret** choose not to visit Elsie the day she gave birth to Phoenix. She'd been married to Sasha for 10 years. He was a truck driver, then in prison, then a truck driver again (which suited Margaret well enough). Now, however, they have a place with an industrial shop (Chop Shop) out back. It is good money, but it means Sasha is always around. Flash back - 16 year old Elsie hadn't told them she was pregnant until she was 6 months along and refused to say who the father was. Sasha had insisted she be put in the home. Annie, or Mamere, though in her 80s, had said she could come and live with her after, but Margaret knew that meant it'd be her lumbered with the work. Annie, a sad woman who had grown up in a shanty town lean-to, had been an older mother and cared little for her youngest child and only daughter Margaret. The oldest sibling, John, was in and out of juvie for B and E, Joseph was a charmer and Toby was dumb. They were all, including Margaret, well known around the neighbourhood for being scrappy. Margaret's father Mac, though happier than his wife, was equally distant. He worked away on the roads all summer and was home all winter. He was proud to be Métis and proud to be a Stranger. They both doted on Elsie who lived with them when times were tough for Margaret during Sasha's incarceration. When Margaret was younger she'd died her hair aubern, got a job, done well in high school and worked her way in to Pre-Law part time at college whilst working full time at Eaton's. This is where she met Becky from Ukraine and the two became best friends. The day after Phoenix was born Annie convinces Margaret finally to move into her big house. In a few months Elsie and the baby will be released from the home to move back in with Annie. 


#Year Two


- 5 - **Phoenix** is pretty much permanently in Solitary (SNU) now. After she returned the 1st time Dez was out on suspended sentence and so Dakota became the new target or her anger. They tried to put her in the cottages with 5 of the older girls, but she set the microwave on fire, which escalated to her biting a guard (Chris) breaking the skin of his hand. She was sent to the psych ward, and ""treated"" (read dosed up so high she was a shell of her self) for PPD. She returned to SNU but they continue her on a high dose of Diazapam whilst Ben talks to her through the cell door. Eventually they lower her dose and she feels the rage return (though not as strongly nor with any motivations to act on it), and with it come a flood of emotions and tears. Ben continues to talk, and talk, and talk. She finally goes outside and the snow makes her realise she has no idea of the date. Its the 10th of December and Sparrow will be 1 year and 8 months old by now. She begins to escalate, but the guards quickly restrain her. Later Ben brings her a [Nanimo bar](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nanaimo_bar) and stories of [wiindigoo](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wendigo)

1npyfu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Psychosis/comments/1npyfu9/brief_psychosis/,Brief Psychosis,"Hi everyone,

I’m not sure if what I’m experiencing is what could be psychosis or not but I wanted to share some of my weirdest experiences here.

I have had 3 night terrors(?) 3 sleep paralysis episodes and one horrible case of insomnia.

All my night terrors are similar in nature. My first night terror happened when I was in middle school. I know everyone experiences these differently but I don’t feel like what I was experiencing to be a regular night terror. I woke up randomly in the middle of the night with a bit of anxiety but it was slowly becoming a creeping feeling of someone out there to get me and an impending sense of inevitable despair. I got out of bed and went to the kitchen to get all the knives, forks, and spoons I could grab and then left the house in panic telling myself that “I have to leave” I kept repeating that over and over and when my mom came out wondering what was going on I had no idea but then I started crying profusely telling her I had to leave. Then the next day it was like nothing happened. She told me about it and I actually remembered it vividly and told her yea I have no idea.

The second and third instances of this happened within 2 weeks of each other (and I’m almost certain it was caused by a specific traumatic event which I don’t really want to share here) so I know what caused it which was extreme stress I assume. This second instance was similar but the theme behind it was weird. I’ll try my best to explain but it started with me waking up to that same feeling of a slow but sure feeling of an impending sense of dread. This sense of dread in my mind was a feeling that at that currently moment, a war was coming and that there was absolutely no escape. Every passing second was followed by a vision that someone, something, like an army of some sort was closing in. During this time, I started hyperventilating and eventually lead to me taking steps outside but knowing that whatever I did was meaningless and the inevitable(?) would happen. I darted back and forth from my front door and I physically started to feel pain each passing second. As that invisible entity or army or whatever it was was closing in, I felt more and more debilitating pain and agony.  Then I started to snap back to reality and toward the end of that I was wondering what the hell I was doing and then I went back to sleep like nothing happened. 

The third instance was definitely the worst of them all. This happened with a roommate (who I hope was asleep). I woke up with the same feeling but this time it happened more rapidly. I started feeling that same sense of inevitable doom but instead of a weird army, it was instead a closing circle of death. (Yes much like a battle royale game, with a closing ring) when that ring closed in completely I lost my shit. I rushed outside at around 3 am and I started frantically running around my college dorm at the time. I ran a really weird route where I was being chased by some random intangible entity. I was running around for about 20 min dodging certain areas that I thought the entity was coming from and then started crying followed by a snap back to reality. It was so bizarre.

Regarding night terrors, I don’t hear much of what I experienced at all so idk if it follows what a typical night terrors is.

My sleep paralysis incidents were weird too. They all happened as I was falling asleep, not when waking up. The first instance I was able to look around my room. I saw a black entity in the corner of my room and I heard a bunch of whispering I couldn’t make out. I was able to get out of it by moving my pinky which Lead to my arm and then the rest of my body. 

The second instance wasn’t particularly that scary but it was incredibly weird nonetheless. I felt phantom movement where I felt as if I moved parts of my body but then when I think again I haven’t moved at all. I thought I moved my arm a whole foot but they were locked in place when I looked. 

The third instance was the scariest. I was locked in bed and I FELT something touching my leg. And right when I was able to snap out of it, the thing shot up my body and I screamed a bit. 

Finally, my insomnia. I’ve had one or 2 days of insomnia and they were awful. But THIS case, I wouldn’t want ANYONE to experience. It started off with me not being able to get much sleep. It was about 5 hours. Then that day I went to go eat brunch with my parents. I drank some coffee and had a croissant sandwich. When I got back in my car, I had probably one of the most euphoric feelings I’ve ever had in my life. I was sitting slumped in the car seat and I felt so incredibly comfortable. I fell asleep for about 10 min but it abruptly ended when I got home. I tried to sleep again but I couldn’t. Then the next few days I was absolutely dying. The second day I couldn’t go to sleep. The usual symptoms, racing heart and thoughts, etc. and in the morning I was terrified of it happening again. Then the third day which was even worse with me begging to be able to sleep while I kept crying. In 3 days I had a total of about 10 hours of sleep. Then the 4th day hit and I’m almost sure I was in psychosis. I was dizzy, I was incredibly sensitive to light, I felt that there were things around me like random entities made of some sort of bubble. My life felt like i was running in 20fps. Everything was lagging a second behind and I couldn’t properly think straight about anything. Then I randomly fell asleep at 7pm and slept until 2pm the next morning and everything was back to normal. I almost feel like maybe it was the result of a slipped drug or something in my food at that brunch spot. Because that really weird sense of pure euphoria was followed by 4 days of agonizing pain (maybe from withdrawal?) 

Anyway, if you came to the end thank you for reading up until here. If any of you have any relatable experiences, please let me know. I just can’t find anyone in my immediate family or friend group that’s experienced any of these things. ",1,1758777899.0,Psychosis,0,1.0,False

My family of 4 (late 40s with 11 yo and 13 yo kids) are considering a move there as the situation here in the U.S. becomes increasingly shitty. We are both physicians (internal medicine subspecialist and primary care) and are currently applying for Canadian citizenship by descent.


We know Vancouver is extremely expensive, but having practiced medicine in the U.S. for ~15 years, we're fortunate to have some financial freedom in terms of choosing a neighborhood that best fits our ideal lifestyle. We currently live in Portland, OR in the Buckman neighborhood for those who are familiar, which is a close-in urban neighborhood with a mix of apartments and single-family detached homes and is very walkable with lots of restaurants and close to multiple city parks and mass transit. It's a bit on the younger side (one of the more hipster Portland hoods), which we like. Living in Portland, we're no stranger to property crime/homeless and know Vancouver has the same issues though it sounds like they're a lot more localized to east hastings/less spread out than Portland? We're typical Portlanders and pretty liberal and often bike commute to work and school. 


We'd like to find a Vancouver neighborhood with similar amenities to where we live now:

-Single-family homes 

-Proximity to nature: waterfront, good parks, hiking and skiing

-Good walkability to amenities like groceries, restaurants, coffee shops, shopping etc

-Good for bike commuting and long fitness rides (road, gravel, MTB)


We've visited Vancouver a bunch in the past though we don't know it super well. Downtown/Yaletown/West End are a bit too urban than what we're looking for, but we still want to be relatively close to the downtown core. We liked Kitsilano a lot for nature/water access, walkability and proximity to downtown, but not sure that we could afford it. North/West Vancouver sound like they're great for nature access, but haven't spent as much time there and unsure how well those areas meet our criteria. Any other neighborhoods we should be considering? Depending on what jobs are available, we're also considering Victoria/Kelowna though I'm worried they'd feel too small

You know the feeling - you're tired, stressed, maybe had a long day, and your workout motivation is somewhere between zero and negative infinity.

Old me would just write off the whole day and feel guilty about it. Current me has figured out this whole ""stealth cardio"" thing where I trick myself into moving without it feeling like exercise. It's like I'm sneaking fitness past my own laziness, and honestly? It's been a game changer for maintaining some kind of activity even on my most exhausted days.

**Why ""Stealth Cardio"" Saves My Sanity**

Let me paint you a picture: It's 7 PM, I've been staring at a computer screen all day, my brain feels like mush, and the thought of changing into workout clothes and doing jumping jacks makes me want to cry. But I also know that if I just collapse on the couch and scroll my phone for 3 hours, I'm going to feel even worse tomorrow.

Enter stealth cardio - movement that doesn't feel like punishment when you're already running on empty. It's the difference between getting zero activity and getting some activity, and that difference actually matters more than I thought it would.

**The Philosophy Behind Stealth Cardio**

**Rule #1:** It can't feel like ""working out"" or my tired brain will rebel **Rule #2:** No special clothes or equipment required **Rule #3:** It has to be something I can do while doing other stuff **Rule #4:** If it raises my heart rate even a little bit, it counts

This isn't about burning tons of calories or getting swole. It's about keeping my body moving when my motivation is in the toilet, and maintaining the habit of daily movement even when I can't manage ""real"" exercise.

**My Stealth Cardio Arsenal**

**The ""Productive Procrastination"" Method**

When I'm avoiding doing something (usually chores), I turn the avoidance into movement:

- Need to fold laundry? I do it standing up and pace between items
- Dishes to wash? I do calf raises while scrubbing
- Waiting for food to cook? Kitchen dance party for one
- On a long phone call? I pace around my apartment the whole time

My record is getting 4,000 steps during a single work conference call where I was basically just listening anyway.

**The ""Commercial Break Cardio""**

Watching Netflix? Every time I pause to get snacks or use the bathroom, I take the long way around my apartment. Sometimes I'll do a few stretches or walk in place for like 30 seconds before sitting back down.

Not exactly CrossFit, but it breaks up hours of sitting and tricks me into moving when I thought I was just being lazy.

**The ""Errand Enhancement"" Strategy**

This one's probably my favorite because it makes boring tasks feel more productive:

- Park farther away from store entrances (but not so far that I hate myself)
- Take the stairs instead of elevators when I'm not carrying heavy stuff
- Walk to the far bathroom at work instead of the close one
- Pace while brushing teeth (2 minutes of automatic movement!)

It's like adding tiny movement bonuses to stuff I have to do anyway.

**The ""Waiting Game"" Approach**

Anytime I'm waiting for something, I try to move instead of just standing there:

- Waiting for the microwave? Gentle stretching or marching in place
- Waiting for my friend to show up? Walk around the block
- Waiting for the bus? Shift my weight, do ankle circles, anything but just standing still
- Waiting in any line? Subtle calf raises or weight shifting

Turns dead time into sneaky cardio time.

**The ""Background Movement"" Techniques**

**Fidgeting Upgrade**

I'm naturally a fidgety person, so I turned my nervous energy into productive movement:

- Bouncing my leg while working (but like, more intentionally)
- Doing desk stretches during video calls when my camera's off
- Walking around while talking on the phone
- Standing and swaying instead of just standing still

It's movement that happens automatically while I'm focused on other things.

**The ""Multitasking Movement"" Hack**

Basically combining movement with stuff I was going to do anyway:

- Walking while listening to podcasts instead of lying down
- Doing gentle yoga stretches while watching TV
- Pacing while FaceTiming friends
- Dancing while cleaning (even if it's just swaying to music)

My brain doesn't register it as exercise because I'm primarily focused on the other activity.

**The Psychology That Makes It Work**

**No Pressure, No Guilt**

The beauty of stealth cardio is that there's no failure state. Got 500 extra steps while pacing during a phone call? That's a win. Did some calf raises while waiting for coffee to brew? Also a win.

There's no ""I should have done more"" because these weren't planned workouts to begin with.

**Habit Stacking**

I attach tiny movements to stuff I already do every day. Brush teeth = pace around bathroom. Make coffee = calf raises while waiting. Check mail = take the long way back to my apartment.

It becomes automatic because it's linked to existing habits.

**Energy That Builds Energy**

Here's the weird part - even tiny amounts of movement seem to give me slightly more energy instead of draining it. Maybe it's just getting my blood moving, but I swear 10 minutes of gentle movement makes me feel more awake than 10 minutes of sitting.

**The ""Better Than Nothing"" Mindset**

**Lowering the Bar to Manageable**

On days when I'm exhausted, the choice isn't between stealth cardio and a real workout. It's between stealth cardio and being completely sedentary. When I frame it that way, the choice is obvious.

**Consistency Over Intensity**

I'd rather move a little bit every day than do intense workouts twice a week and burn out. Stealth cardio keeps me in the habit of daily movement even when I can't manage anything intense.

**Building Momentum for Better Days**

Sometimes doing 20 minutes of gentle movement on a tired day actually motivates me to do a real workout the next day. It's like it reminds my body that movement feels good.

**When Stealth Cardio Actually Adds Up**

I started tracking my steps just out of curiosity, and I was shocked at how much my stealth cardio days contribute. A day of pacing during phone calls, taking stairs, and walking while listening to music can easily add up to 6,000+ steps without feeling like I ""worked out.""

Over a week, that's the difference between being mostly sedentary and getting a decent amount of movement. Not marathon-level fitness, but way better than nothing.

**The Reality Check**

Will stealth cardio turn me into an athlete? Obviously not. But will it keep me from becoming a complete couch potato during stressful periods? Absolutely.

It's not about optimization - it's about maintaining a baseline level of movement when life gets overwhelming and formal exercise feels impossible.

**Anyone else have sneaky ways to stay active when you're too tired for real workouts? What's your go-to movement when motivation is MIA?** I'm convinced there are probably tons of creative ways to trick ourselves into moving that we haven't thought of yet.

**TL;DR:** Developed ""stealth cardio"" methods for exhausted days - pacing during phone calls, taking stairs, moving while doing chores, and adding tiny movements to existing habits. It's not intense, but it keeps me moving when formal exercise feels impossible.",1,1758777429.0,NoFriendsFriendsClub,0,1.0,False

Bahrain in 2025: The Year Change Got Faster\
\
Alt text: Business environment in modern setting, Bahrain’s corporate landscape., Bahrain’s economic growth is projected to hit 3.2% in 2025, rebounding strongly post-pandemic, helped by surges in technology, logistics, and foreign investment (Reuters). The Bahrain Economic Development Board (EDB) has reported over 180 new companies registered in Bahrain Bay alone this year.\
But with growth, churn comes too—liquidations are at their highest since 2018, driven by sector shifts and regulatory tightening. According to Gulf News, new 2025 labour rules (effective March 2025) now require all employee dues to be settled and reported directly to the LMRA before final company deregistration.\
Bahrain’s openness—especially its 99% foreign ownership (detailed here) and simplified free zone registrations (learn more)—means rapid company formation is easy, but the closure process is equally formalized and transparent.\
My recent experience supporting a logistics client through closure in the Diplomatic Area highlighted how quickly regulations change. As of April 2025, Sijilat’s online workflow now instantly alerts the Labour Ministry if wages or end-of-service benefits are disputed. This has virtually eliminated “quiet” closures and protects employees even more strongly than before.\
\
Understanding Employee Rights During Bahrain Company Liquidation\
The Legal Framework: What Law Says\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation, corporate paperwork in Bahrain. lays out employee rights during closure, updated under the Labour Law Amendment (Decree No. 7 of 2025). These rights include:\
\
Notice Period: Employees must receive written notice (minimum 30 days or as per contract).\
Outstanding Salaries: All salary arrears must be paid immediately upon initiating liquidation.\
End-of-Service Gratuity: Employees are entitled to a gratuity based on length of service, calculated as outlined by the Ministry of Labour and Social Development.\
Unused Leave Encashment: Companies must pay for any unused annual leave.\
Indemnity and Allowances: All other contractual benefits must be honored.\
LMRA Clearance: The Labour Market Regulatory Authority must confirm that all dues are settled before the Commercial Registration (CR) is canceled.\
\
Ignoring any of these? The MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism) will refuse to complete the company’s closure. And the founder—and their sponsor, if applicable—may face a travel ban until all obligations are met.\
Majlis-Style Meetings: The Secret to Stress-Free Settlement\
A quick aside—sometimes the old ways work best. I’ve found that holding a majlis-style meeting, complete with traditional coffee, fosters goodwill and clarifies doubts, reducing disputes. Bahraini custom values openness and respect. Employees deeply appreciate this gesture—especially during Ramadan or Eid.\
\
Practical Example: How Employee Settlements Actually Work\
Imagine a tech startup in Bahrain Bay employing 10 staff. The company must close due to funding loss. Here’s what really happens:\
\
First, formal notice is issued (with copy sent to the LMRA).\
Second, salary, gratuity, and remaining leave are calculated per each employee.\
Third, a certified accountant (find one here) audits records and issues a “final settlement” statement.\
Fourth, all payments must be wired or paid by cheque—no cash-only deals.\
Fifth, employee consent is recorded (often via Sijilat’s system), with benefit receipts signed.\
Finally, once the LMRA confirms all dues settled, the Sijilat system activates the official CR closure process.\
\
The trickiest part? Making sure you start early (at least 1–2 months before planned closure) and keep all documents scanned and organized. Once, I forgot to get a signed receipt for a staff gratuity. It delayed my CR cancellation by three weeks—costly, and absolutely avoidable.\

Alt text: Business process and documentation, Bahrain liquidation workflow. to download the latest employee list.\
2. Calculate and Review All Employee Dues\
  - Salary, allowance, overtime, leave encashment, and gratuity.\
  - Budget: For a company with 10–15 employees, expect BHD 2,500–8,000 in settlements, depending on tenure.\
3. Schedule Individual Majlis-Style Exit Meetings\
  - Helps minimize disputes and builds trust.\
  - Include coffee and dates for tradition, even if hybrid/remote (I’ve done this via Zoom with virtual coffee delivered!).\
4. Submit Final Payroll & Settlement Sheets\
  - Have an approved accountant (recommended resource) sign off on all figures.\
  - Upload into Sijilat and notify both the MOICT and LMRA.\
5. Settle Any Labour Disputes Before Final Closure\
  - Labour Ministry mediation available in Isa Town, but queues are shorter at Seef District’s branch.\
6. Obtain LMRA & MOICT Clearance\
  - No clearance, no closure. It’s that simple.\
  - Pro Tip: Apply Sunday-Tuesday mornings to avoid long lines; Ramadan hours require even earlier scheduling.\
7. Complete CR Cancellation in Sijilat\
  - Final step. Download and archive deregistration certificates securely.\
Money-Saving Tip:\
Pre-scan all employee contracts and payroll details to your Sijilat account. It saves hours in the office and can be done off-site.\

But I might have found a solution (keep in mind, everybody have different reactions to certain stuff so this might not work for everyone) I was a coffee addict before i got gerd. And had to stop drinking coffee. Until one day I got curious and thought there has to be a way for people with gerd to enjoy coffee. So I decided to experiment and drank any kind of coffee to see which one will cause to trigger my symptoms. Light Roast and Medium Roast triggered my symptoms. Cold Brew and Dark Roast coffee didn’t (Also side note, the coffee was brewed cold. I did ice coffee with these cause hot drinks is bad for gerd) The Cold brew and dark roast didn’t trigger my symptoms because they have the lowest acid content of any coffee. I also went to starbucks to see if their coffee will trigger my symptoms. And to my surprise it did. So I recommend to brew your own coffee at home. If you don’t have a brewer at home i recommend using instant coffee. half a tablespoon, with a little bit of creamer. No sugar. AGAIN, This will not for everyone. 

So In conclusion. Stay away from light roast and medium roast. And Try Cold Brews and Dark Roast. Since they have the lower acid content. Also decaf if you just like the flavor of coffee but make sure it’s swiss’s water processed. ",1,1758776325.0,GERD,4,0.67,False

So obviously, I stopped doing that. I felt like shit. Now, im built like a lumpy potato.

What I have been doing in the last month is walking a minimum of around 1.5 miles, and a max of around 5 miles. I eat around one or two kinda bigger meals a day, and maybe a snack or coffee when I can afford to buy one. (College, so no money.)

The gnawing sense that the game is fixed. That the odds are stacked against you from the start. You’re not wrong, and bad luck at the start doesn’t mean everything balances out overtime. 

We are living in a debt crisis.

You can't solve inequality, fix education, or rebuild infrastructure if the nation is bankrupt. For decades the U.S. has and still is printing its purchasing power into oblivion. Increasing the money supply aka debt, means inflation rises causing your dollars to buy less and less each month. This is even before factoring in foreign exchange rates that moves based on volatility, and if volatility is high momentum of money slows, or worse stagnates because planned ROI is too uncertain for investors to invest.

Furthermore, your dollar will afford even less if the government selects to impose and or raise additional artificial price gouging tariffs. Tariffs will make everything more expensive, because the end consumer is forced to pay until broke. All tariffs hide the real price signals, making the signals less visible leading to market volatility. Visible price signals are required for an economy to function properly, and to shake this up can delay corrections from being priced in for months and or fiscal quarters. Which is like purchasing a coffee on Monday at $5, and then for it to rise sharply to $8 overnight. Tariffs also builds on a false equilibrium of opportunity costs, instead of improving added value to the goods and services in the market.

To put it simply, more businesses are forced to close forever, and your real wages will never rise. Offshoring becomes more incentivized as it redistributes skills, while to exploit cheaper labor using the same technology and or equipment at either regional point location.

Then moved onto paying for her coffees, takeaways etc.

And it is SO HARD to be patient with myself when moving my hands feels like trying to operate a crane game via walkie-talkie. 

I don't know whether or not dyspraxia is the root of the issue... it feels, more than anything, like my brain is too full with overstimulation, and its rerouted bandwidth away from my sense of proprioception and just the general ability to pay attention to my own movements. Even when I'm actively watching myself, it feels like my movements are on the jankiest auto-pilot known to man. 

When using my hands, I'm constantly bumping or even slamming what I'm holding into nearby items/surfaces, failing to grasp or manipulate objects, my typing accuracy has gone to shit, objects will simply fall out of my hands, and so on. If I'm handling anything delicate, like trying to put a lid on my morning coffee, I have to basically pause all other brain activity so I can hyperfocus on *making my hands do the thing*, and it's still like trying to use a battering ram to pluck a single hair. 

This round started a few days ago, and I've already lost any ability to be patient with myself. I don't have the energy to get the meltdown that's been stalking me *over with*, and I just want to be able to pour my morning coffee without nearly shattering the carafe — and type a single sentence without having to backtrack a dozen typos.

I know it changes regularly in St Johns for some things, and I know I’m way out of the loop on a lot (especially as life circumstances are very diff now). 

Looking for some recommendations for the following - we tend to like mid range stuff that’s affordable but not bottom of the barrel. Happy to pay a bit more for quality items that last. 

- Mid range furniture that’s better than IKEA but not 4K for a couch or a bed. (Did you know NL prices at major furniture stores are inflated 150%? We were going to sell our stuff and pack light but it’s cheaper to bring a lot of it)
- Home goods (similarly mid range, better than homesense but not 10x the cost.)
- Fresh produce / farm eggs 
- Treat type baked goods (like cupcakes or donuts or scones) 
- Bougie baby stuff/clothes (besides Newbornlander) or consignment baby/toddler clothes stores (besides once upon a child)
- Vegetarian take out 
- Play groups/gyms for toddlers and babies 
- Art supplies

Last night, Jeff invited me over for a beer. We were sitting on his porch, talking about how insane things had gotten, when he leaned in and said something that made my blood run cold: *“You know… Karen wasn’t wrong about you being dangerous.”*

I laughed nervously, thinking he was joking. But then he pulled out my missing gnome. My gnome. It was sitting right there on his coffee table.

He admitted he’d taken it after the break-in. “To protect you,” he claimed. But then he launched into this bizarre rant about how the HOA needed “new leadership” and how *together* we could “reshape the neighborhood.” He wanted me to run for HOA president once Karen was out of the picture—and suggested we could “use fear to keep people in line.”

I told him he was insane, grabbed the gnome, and left. But now I don’t know who to trust. Was Jeff helping me all along, or manipulating me? Did he plant the USB? The envelopes?

Meanwhile, the police investigation revealed that Karen’s “consulting fees” company had ties to a larger network of shady contractors. Apparently, multiple HOAs across the county were involved. Which means this isn’t just local corruption—it’s a full-blown racket.

And guess what? The news picked it up. A local reporter knocked on my door asking for a statement. The headline the next morning: **“Garden Gnome Sparks County-Wide HOA Corruption Probe.”**

A moth to every pulse of your small light.
Your laugh, a comet trailing gold and wine,
I chart its arcs and claim each star as mine.

I keep a map of places where you breathe,
Lay trails of murmurs only I can read.
Your name’s a bell that tugs the moon to stay;
I learn its chime and never dare look away.

I worship inches where your secrets hide,
Trace latitude by the curve of your sighs.
In every mirror I invent your face,
And steal the minutes time has left to waste.

Obsession tastes like coffee on your lips,
Like midnight letters folded into ships.
I send my heart in small and scandalous notes,
It docks at your breath and on your laughter floats.

If madness flowers, let it be for you:
A garden full of sins that feel like truth.
Take my two hands, they know the path, the art,
To keep your name like a compass in my heart.

My parents are religious and vegetarian so i cant eat meat at home. I do make eggs but cant make them on Tuesdays and other religious days. (I swear there are so many religious days)

I want to balance out my plate
Like 1/2 vegetables 
1/4 protein 
1/4 carbs
A thumb of healthy fats

How do i do this ????? 
I cant think of any protein other than paneer and cant even eat it everyday
And the vegetables we make at home half a plate of it is insane yk like allo paneer or bhindi and stuff like that. 

My ususally diet is 
Breakfast > oats / 2 egg omelet + 1 roti + chai
Morning snack > fruits + nuts 
Lunch > 1 katrori rice / 1/2 katori rice + 1 roti + dal/sabzi + curd
Snacks > chai/coffee/green tea + 3 buiscuits / 1 toast
Dinner > 2 roti + sabzi

1npxdc1,https://www.reddit.com/r/japanlife/comments/1npxdc1/question_about_toothpaste_andor_oral_hygiene/,Question about toothpaste and/or oral hygiene products,"Hi everyone,

For a bit of a background, when I was in my home country, my oral hygiene routine was very simple: brush my teeth twice a day in addition to using gum sometimes here and there. Barely visit the dentist for any kind of teeth whitening procedures and my teeth were completely fine, as white as snow. Toothpaste wise back then, I didn't use any expensive or special treatment ones either, just average popular ones selling at supermarkets. I don't smoke or vape either.

But lo and behold, after a while living in Japan, my teeth has started turning yellow with the exact same oral hygiene routine. I even copied my Japanese co workers and started brushing my teeth 3 times a day (an addition one after lunch). I don't know how it went wrong, but since the oral hygiene routine is the same, I am assuming that the issue is with the toothpaste. I am using the extra whitening type but doesn't seem to improve at all.

My fellows, are you experiencing the same problem? If you do, what did you do to keep your teeth shine and white? Do you have any recommendation on toothpaste or extra oral hygiene products?

Edit: Have been living in Japan around 4 years and vocab mistake

Edit 2: Thank you everyone for your advice! The reason might be because that I have started consuming coffee excessively in this one recent year. ",0,1758774130.0,japanlife,23,0.29,False
