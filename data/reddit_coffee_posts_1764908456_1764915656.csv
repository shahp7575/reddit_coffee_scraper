1penucx,https://www.reddit.com/r/fredericton/comments/1penucx/any_muslim_reverts_in_fredericton_looking_to/,Any Muslim Reverts in Fredericton? Looking to Connect.,"Assalamu alaikum everyone,

I’m a recent revert (almost 1 year) to Islam living in Fredericton, and I’m hoping to connect with other reverts in the city. I haven’t had the chance to visit the mosque yet (feeling a little nervous about that step, to be honest), and I think it would be really helpful to talk to others who have been on a similar journey.

I’ve actually met two reverts recently, which inspired me to see who else is out there! It would be great to have a small group for coffee, support, or just to share experiences.

If you’re a revert in the Fredericton area, or if you have any revert friends, please leave a comment or send me a DM. Jazakallah khair!

I’m a 33-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing. I'm also a huge fan of coffee, chips, chocolate, and ice cream. I don’t drink or smoke, and I prefer one-on-one chats over group settings or parties.

All ages, races, locations, time zones, and relationship statuses are welcome to message me. I just ask that you’re respectful and genuinely want to chat.

1penqv4,https://www.reddit.com/r/BokunoheroFanfiction/comments/1penqv4/ryukyu_and_ippan_josei_dating/,Ryukyu and Ippan Josei dating,"Ryuko Tatsuma and Ippan Josei were drinking coffee in a regular cafe. The Dragon heroine was able to stay unrecognized by wearing unremarkable clothing and a different hairstyle. This normality was something she needed to take breaks from her heroic routine. In front of her, the fox lady was talking to her about unpleasant customers. Ryuko's mind went back to their first dates months ago.



They met through a run-of-the-mil dating app, and Ryukyu left no mention about her public persona. She wanted someone who would like her as a person, not as hero. Ippan wanted somebody big and strong, but given her height, it was quite unrealistic. She had to lower her bar in that regard.



Their first date was hiking trail away from city noises. Ippan said that she was a hair stylist in a mall, while Ryuko only mentioned working within law enforcement. The tall lady complained that her height felt like a burden because she was a timid person. Josei wanted to be carried and cuddled like a small plushy, but her size made it near impossible. Tatsuma chuckled and said that her friend opposite problem: not being treated seriously because she was so short. It made Ippan chuckle too, seeing how a different person directly opposite issue. The fox was towering at 3 meters tall, while her partner was only 176 centimeters in her current form. Ippan felt so uncomfortably huge.



Back to the present, Ryukyu decided to open up. Ippan didn't seem particularly obsessed with heroes, so there was hope of them staying on the same terms. Besides, Ryuko wanted to vent out her frustrations at someone who would listen.



When they were coming back from an Ice Rink, Ryuko started the conversation.



""Is it okay if I share a secret of mine?""



""Sure.""



""I am Ryukyu, The Dragon hero.""



""Yeah, right."" Ippan said in disbelief. ""Look, not everyone who looks like a hero is one.""



""I'm serious."" Ryuko showed a photo of herself in her hero costume. 



It was much easier to understand the similarities when they were shown directly.



""Oh..."" The fox lady gulped. ""I... er... should I be worried?""



""Worried? Why?""



""I mean, I... You are a top ranking hero, and I'm just a hairdresser. Am I stepping out of line? Did I make you upset and now you're establishing that I don't deserve you? Is this a way...""



""Calm down, please."" Ryukyu did deep breaths to show her girlfriend how to collect her nerves. ""You are overthinking this.""



""But, but... You are a celebrity, and I am...""



""See? Overthinking. I didn't tell you this to make some strong statement; I just felt like you deserve yo know.""



""But why me? Why did you date me all this time? You have so many fans.""



""I have a feeling those fans only care about my persona, not me.""



""Well, I... I like Ryukyu, she is big and strong..."" Josei blushed. ""Wait! That's not what I meant. I meant to say...""



""No worries, I know that you mean you like me for me."" Tatsuma smiled. ""But I guess I can be Ryukyu for you sometimes.""



Much to Ryuko's delight, her relationship with Ippan stayed mostly the same. There were dating casually as unassuming civilians. When Ryukyu felt ready, she took Ippan for a flight over a faraway forest in her dragon form. The tall woman felt tiny and secure when hugging and kissing a giant dragon carrying her to the skies. It was like a dream come true to her.",1,1764915295.0,BokunoheroFanfiction,0,1.0,False

1penqfc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CustomerService/comments/1penqfc/mobile_order_pickup_shouldnt_be_a_scavenger_hunt/,Mobile order pickup shouldn't be a scavenger hunt (my Tim Horton's experience),"I placed a mobile order at Tim Hortons at 12:45 PM, hoping to grab it quickly before a 1 PM meeting. My coffee was ready, but my food wasn’t visible. I waited **20 minutes** before asking an employee because the store was slammed with the lunch rush, and I didn’t want to interrupt staff already juggling multiple orders. I assumed they were still preparing my food—maybe the croissants needed baking, or the sausages were still cooking—so I didn’t want to pester anyone while they were obviously busy. When I finally asked, the employee found my food under the counter—nobody even knew who put it there. Meanwhile, other people’s orders were in the designated pickup area, so I had no clue why mine wasn’t. Only part of my order was visible, which added to the confusion.

To be clear, this isn’t about being entitled or “being a Karen”—I’m not blaming the staff. They were doing their best under pressure. I also get that theft and order mix-ups are a concern, which is why some locations might keep orders behind the counter. The problem is inconsistent store practices: some locations leave all orders in the pickup spot, some put them behind the counter, and some hide them under the counter where customers have no visual cue that their order is ready. These wildly different strategies make mobile ordering a guessing game rather than a convenience.

This was completely preventable. If all mobile orders were placed consistently in a visible, designated area, and the system followed corporate design instead of arbitrary local decisions, customers wouldn’t have to wait 20 minutes wondering where their food is. Simple visual indicators or a dedicated pickup staff member during peak hours would solve most of these issues.

Other chains like Starbucks and Chipotle manage mobile pickup consistently: orders are left where customers can see them, and the system actually works. So if a local manager can arbitrarily decide how customers should pick up orders, why does Tim Hortons corporate even design a physical space for self-serve mobile pickup at all? It’s almost like they enjoy making customers play “Find My Breakfast.”

The 20-minute wait made me late to my meeting, which really highlighted the inefficiency. This isn’t about impatience—it’s about a system that’s supposed to save time but consistently fails to do so.

Has anyone else experienced this? How do other chains handle theft or mix-ups while keeping orders visible? I’d love to hear thoughts on how mobile pickup could be made consistent and reliable.

  
**TL;DR:** Tim Hortons’ mobile pickup system is inconsistent and confusing, making customers wait unnecessarily. Staff are doing their best, but corporate and franchise practices need a serious overhaul.",1,1764915251.0,CustomerService,0,1.0,False

1penpmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArunachalConfession/comments/1penpmj/she_leaned_in_everything_else_fell_apart/,She leaned in. Everything else fell apart.,"People think affairs start with temptation.
Ours didn’t.
Ours started with pain.

Some stories aren’t born out of romance. Some are born out of hunger — the kind you hide even from yourself.

Both of us (M32, F32) were married. Both of us were exhausted. Both of us were slipping through the cracks of our own lives without anyone noticing.

We were just colleagues at first. Two married people pretending our lives were fine, carrying cracks nobody else could see.

But when you sit next to someone every day, fight the same deadlines, share the same coffee breaks, the walls start to fall.
One honest conversation becomes two… then suddenly you’re confessing things you never even admitted to yourself.

Her marriage was hanging by a thread.
Mine wasn’t far behind.
And maybe that’s what brought us closer — not desire, but the comfort of being understood by someone who felt the exact same emptiness.

I don’t know when it stopped being friendship and turned into fire.
Maybe it was in the way she looked at me during stand-ups…
Maybe it was the way her voice softened only when she spoke to me…
Maybe it was the way two married people, both starving for affection, accidentally became each other’s escape.

It was supposed to be just another corporate outing — presentations, dinners, forced team bonding.
But late at night, after everyone drifted to their rooms, we found ourselves sitting together on the balcony outside the hotel’s conference hall. The city lights below us, the ocean far away, and that strange silence that makes people say things they shouldn’t.

She looked tired… the kind of tired that comes from holding yourself together for too long.

“Sometimes I feel like I’m living in a house, not a marriage,” she whispered.
I didn’t know if it was the night breeze or the way her voice cracked, but something inside me snapped.
I admitted the same — that my own marriage was surviving on routine, not love.

That one confession lit up a spark we had been pretending not to see.

She shifted closer.
I didn’t move away.

For a moment, neither of us spoke.
Just breath against breath, fear mixing with a kind of electric pull that felt both wrong and inevitable.

She wasn’t just someone else’s wife in that moment.
She was a storm who had spent years pretending to be calm.

There was no hesitation.
No fear.
No guilt.
Just pure, undeniable pull.

We came close, She came close enough for me to feel her breath.
Her fingers shook—not with doubt, but with the weight of a desire she had buried for years.

Her voice trembled when she said,
“We both know this is wrong… but tell me why it feels like the most honest moment I’ve had in years.”

And then it happened —
her mangalsutra slipped forward, touching her cleavage like a spark, reminding us what forbidden thing we are going to do. 

She didn't budge.

It wasn’t guilt.
It wasn’t warning.
It was fuel.

That black-beaded chain didn’t remind either of us of boundaries.
It only made the moment sharper…
forbidden…
dangerously real.

She said, 
I don’t want to be anyone’s responsibility tonight… just someone’s desire.

And what happened after that —
we both chose it.
The night was full of moans, screams, wetness, intoxicating smell, smile, laughter, pleasure, everything.

Our marriages, our routines, our hollow lives — they all faded into nothing.

It wasn’t about breaking vows — it was about finding a version of ourselves we had buried under responsibilities, routines, and expectations.

The only thing that stayed between us…
was that mangalsutra.

And God, the intensity of that when she rode in cowgirl and her mangalsutra dangled between her breasts. That mangalsutra that defined that she was someone's else wife. That made us realise that we are doing a forbidden and taboo thing. That mangalsutra told us that it was so wrong yet felt right at that moment.

After everything, she lay beside me — not soft, not emotional —
just breathing hard, staring at the ceiling like she was finally awake after years of sleep.

Her mangalsutra rested on her collarbone, rising and falling with every breath, the gold pendant glinting like a silent acknowledgement of what we had done.

She didn’t apologize.
Neither did I.

Instead, she looked at me with a half-smile — dark, confident, unashamed — and said:

“We can’t undo this. And I don’t want to.”

And that’s exactly what stayed with me.

Not the warmth.
Not the closeness.
But the feeling of crossing a line so boldly…
that turning back was never an option. ",1,1764915176.0,ArunachalConfession,0,1.0,False

# Coffee With Two Shots of Anxiety

***How My Social Anxiety Started a New Trend***

This isn’t a story of extreme triumph, or one with a dramatic ending. It’s about something so small it should never have its own story, but it does. It’s a story of how our brains can turn something so little, into the next Mount Everest. So, sit back and be prepared to feel better about yourself.

It was a warm summer day, and I was sitting on the beach. Wrong story. I was actually sitting in my freezing college apartment on a cold winter day. It was one of those days that had me contemplating cuddling up with the cockroaches just to stay warm. Luckily for me, my girlfriend was there instead. Out of boredom, we decided it was time for a coffee break.

Little did I know that these two words would lead to a story that stuck with me forever.

Withing minutes, we were running across the cold parking lot. We jumped into the wagon and turned the key. But nothing. No engine turning over, just dead. This should have been my omen. My car was warning us. The silence was actually a scream.

**“YOU’RE ABOUT TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF…STAY HOME! PLEASE!!!”**

Did I listen? Nah, not me. Instead, I found my neighbor and boosted my battery. Success! We are back on track. No need to avoid self-humiliation today.

Finally, we arrived at our favorite coffee shop. I won’t say any names, but let’s just say the place where they have everything, but a normal cup of coffee on the menu. Seriously, it is coffee; why do we need 200 types and none of them the one I want! That will be a rant for another day.

So here we are in line. Suddenly, my heart starts beating faster. There are three people in front of me. I pray somebody has a large order.

You see, I suffer from social anxiety. Having a girlfriend was about as far as my social skills went. I feared public interactions. Not because I disliked people, but due to me always putting my foot in my mouth.

How bad could it be though? It was only coffee, right?

So against all my wishes, the line blazes by. My girlfriend orders her Mocha Latte Frappe Skinny Oat Milk Double Frothed Venti Half-Caff monstrosity.

Now it’s my turn. The barista looked at me. Too friendly, too cheerful, too prepared for this interaction. My anxiety-ridden brain short-circuited. I forgot the name of the drink I get every morning of my life. My anxiety did what it always does. It put me into a panic and asked me to spin the fancy dictionary wheel. My brain screams at me,

**“You moron. Pick a word. Any word. Just pick one!”**

My throat gets tight and my mind goes blank. Who am I? What the heck am I doing here? Why can’t I remember the human language?

So the barista stands there, waiting for a simple response. She is likely in high school and just wants to go home. I’m ready though. I planned for this moment. Here I go. I replied with about as much confidence as a puppy running on a marble floor; slipping and flailing for dear life just to get that shiny new ball. After all my planning, this is all my brain could come up with:

**“Yes, could I please get warm cup of coffee?”**

No, that is not a typo. I was aiming for “one” coffee, but my brain decided it wasn’t on the same page. The barista stares at me with no words. I just want her to blink. Why won’t you blink! I can tell I broke her internal system. She needs a reboot.

Finally, she resets and tells me that their coffee is either hot or cold. What do I do? Do I admit my mistake?

Come on now. If you have read any of my stories, you would know my answer. I was like a degenerate gambler at the craps table. I doubled down, of course! With no word of a lie, this is all my socially awkward brain could spit out:

**“Oh, could you please put some ice into my black coffee? Hot coffee burns my tongue.”**

What? Why would you say that? Would I also like a warm blankie and a pacifier? Come on, brain, my girlfriend heard that! I just want to crawl into a cup of coffee and close the lid behind me.

At this point, I am almost ready to head to the airport and start over again. Somewhere warm, maybe the Cayman Islands? Fiji looks nice. Any place that wasn’t within an earshot of today would be fine.

At this point, I am ready to implode. My girlfriend’s eyes are burning my neck. I can see the question marks floating above the barista’s head. Then, right as I’m about to take off like Usain Bolt’s much slower cousin… something unexpected happens.

A man behind me giggles. Not out of hate, but because he was surprised how much he liked the idea of a warm coffee. He taps me on the shoulder and says,

**“Haha…what a great idea. I always wait 20 minutes to drink my coffee. You are brilliant!”**

Okay, okay. Maybe I added in the brilliant part. What matters is the rest is true. He proceeded to order the exact same thing I did. The barista shook off her confused look and started to make our coffees. And suddenly I wasn’t embarrassed anymore.

I wasn’t spiraling.

I wasn’t dying inside.

Not proud, not perfect. Just relieved.

Because here is a moment. One where I used my inferior language skills to put myself on an island. An island of anxiety and fear. Thinking the world was about to burn me at the stake. Instead, I found a new friend and we started a new trend together.

But most importantly, my fears didn’t come true. Nobody laughed at me. My girlfriend didn’t leave me. I didn’t die of embarrassment. Was I glowing like I just had a sleepover at Chernobyl? 100%. But it is also a story that will stick with me forever. One where I felt closer to society than ever before.

I continued to talk to my new friend as we waited for our perfectly tempered coffees. Then like a beautiful movie, my girlfriend and I walked off into the winter sunset with our coffees.

***I left feeling lighter. Not because everything went perfectly, but because it didn’t, and it was still okay. Better than okay, actually.***

Anxiety will always try to convince us that we are a neon sign. It will always make us feel like we are standing out. But the honest truth? Most people are too busy living their own lives to care. Some people might even laugh with you. Or, like in my case, some might start ordering “warm coffee” too.

***And sometimes that tiny moment, that blink of a connection, is all you need to remind you you’re not alone.***

With a warm coffee in my hand, I wish you goodbye for now.

With all my love and support.

Remember, you deserve more than a life. You deserve happiness.

Did they show any of the additional behaviors listed below? Calms down, Wants to cuddle

The best part of my Daycation was when.......We went to the truck yard and after eating a burger patty he wanted to lean on my leg

Playgroup Observation

11/18: PG1 - Social, RR - Rough & Rowdy

It was one of those days that had me contemplating cuddling up with the cockroaches just to stay warm. Luckily for me, my girlfriend was there instead. Out of boredom, we decided it was time for a coffee break.

Little did I know that these two words would lead to a story that stuck with me forever.

Withing minutes, we were running across the cold parking lot. We jumped into the wagon and turned the key. But nothing. No engine turning over, just dead. This should have been my omen. My car was warning us. The silence was actually a scream.

**“YOU’RE ABOUT TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF…STAY HOME! PLEASE!!!”**

Did I listen? Nah, not me. Instead, I found my neighbor and boosted my battery. Success! We are back on track. No need to avoid self-humiliation today.

Finally, we arrived at our favorite coffee shop. I won’t say any names, but let’s just say the place where they have everything, but a normal cup of coffee on the menu. Seriously, it is coffee; why do we need 200 types and none of them the one I want! That will be a rant for another day.

So here we are in line. Suddenly, my heart starts beating faster. There are three people in front of me. I pray somebody has a large order.

You see, I suffer from social anxiety. Having a girlfriend was about as far as my social skills went. I feared public interactions. Not because I disliked people, but due to me always putting my foot in my mouth.

How bad could it be though? It was only coffee, right?

So against all my wishes, the line blazes by. My girlfriend orders her Mocha Latte Frappe Skinny Oat Milk Double Frothed Venti Half-Caff monstrosity.

Now it’s my turn. The barista looked at me. Too friendly, too cheerful, too prepared for this interaction. My anxiety-ridden brain short-circuited. I forgot the name of the drink I get every morning of my life. My anxiety did what it always does. It put me into a panic and asked me to spin the fancy dictionary wheel. My brain screams at me,

**“You moron. Pick a word. Any word. Just pick one!”**

My throat gets tight and my mind goes blank. Who am I? What the heck am I doing here? Why can’t I remember the human language?

So the barista stands there, waiting for a simple response. She is likely in high school and just wants to go home. I’m ready though. I planned for this moment. Here I go. I replied with about as much confidence as a puppy running on a marble floor; slipping and flailing for dear life just to get that shiny new ball. After all my planning, this is all my brain could come up with:

**“Yes, could I please get warm cup of coffee?”**

No, that is not a typo. I was aiming for “one” coffee, but my brain decided it wasn’t on the same page. The barista stares at me with no words. I just want her to blink. Why won’t you blink! I can tell I broke her internal system. She needs a reboot.

Finally, she resets and tells me that their coffee is either hot or cold. What do I do? Do I admit my mistake?

Come on now. If you have read any of my stories, you would know my answer. I was like a degenerate gambler at the craps table. I doubled down, of course! With no word of a lie, this is all my socially awkward brain could spit out:

**“Oh, could you please put some ice into my black coffee? Hot coffee burns my tongue.”**

What? Why would you say that? Would I also like a warm blankie and a pacifier? Come on, brain, my girlfriend heard that! I just want to crawl into a cup of coffee and close the lid behind me.

At this point, I am almost ready to head to the airport and start over again. Somewhere warm, maybe the Cayman Islands? Fiji looks nice. Any place that wasn’t within an earshot of today would be fine.

At this point, I am ready to implode. My girlfriend’s eyes are burning my neck. I can see the question marks floating above the barista’s head. Then, right as I’m about to take off like Usain Bolt’s much slower cousin… something unexpected happens.

A man behind me giggles. Not out of hate, but because he was surprised how much he liked the idea of a warm coffee. He taps me on the shoulder and says,

**“Haha…what a great idea. I always wait 20 minutes to drink my coffee. You are brilliant!”**

Okay, okay. Maybe I added in the brilliant part. What matters is the rest is true. He proceeded to order the exact same thing I did. The barista shook off her confused look and started to make our coffees. And suddenly I wasn’t embarrassed anymore.

I wasn’t spiraling.

I wasn’t dying inside.

Not proud, not perfect. Just relieved.

Because here is a moment. One where I used my inferior language skills to put myself on an island. An island of anxiety and fear. Thinking the world was about to burn me at the stake. Instead, I found a new friend and we started a new trend together.

But most importantly, my fears didn’t come true. Nobody laughed at me. My girlfriend didn’t leave me. I didn’t die of embarrassment. Was I glowing like I just had a sleepover at Chernobyl? 100%. But it is also a story that will stick with me forever. One where I felt closer to society than ever before.

I continued to talk to my new friend as we waited for our perfectly tempered coffees. Then like a beautiful movie, my girlfriend and I walked off into the winter sunset with our coffees.

***I left feeling lighter. Not because everything went perfectly, but because it didn’t, and it was still okay. Better than okay, actually.***

Anxiety will always try to convince us that we are a neon sign. It will always make us feel like we are standing out. But the honest truth? Most people are too busy living their own lives to care. Some people might even laugh with you. Or, like in my case, some might start ordering “warm coffee” too.

***And sometimes that tiny moment, that blink of a connection, is all you need to remind you you’re not alone.***

With a warm coffee in my hand, I wish you goodbye for now.

With all my love and support.

Remember, you deserve more than a life. You deserve happiness.

1penmn8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ColdWarPowers/comments/1penmn8/event_la_vie_en_ruse/,[EVENT] La Vie en Ruse,"**October, 1954** 

&nbsp;

The chill of an autumn night slowly broke as the sun rose over the Danube. From his seating in the cafe, Vladimir could see the Bridge of Friendship’s steel trusses gleaming in the morning light. The bridge had just opened that summer, one of the most prominent Soviet-assisted projects still in progress, and there was already a decent amount of traffic crossing between Ruse and Giurgiu. It was the only bridge between Vidin and Cernavodă, making it attractive for freight vehicles that otherwise had to queue for specially designed ferries. While he wasn’t a fan of all the new traffic, Vlad did appreciate the potential benefits for his town.

&nbsp;

He took a sip of his coffee, the good stuff from Brazil, and turned back to his paper. The Ruse Monitor had started featuring advertisements from local retailers, so he’d taken to skimming through in case he found a nice gift for his wife. His new posting as a professor at the technical campus was a considerable step up in salary from his previous post teaching rigid body mechanics in Burgas, and he’d been in a better mood ever since coming home again. Plus, the academic culture was a breath of fresh air compared to teaching the Labor Troops. 

&nbsp;

It was a good morning, he decided.

&nbsp;

*****

&nbsp;

The director passed a document folder across the desk. “Miss Filipova, congratulations.”

&nbsp;

She picked it up, resisting the urge to hold it to her chest. “Thank you, director.”

&nbsp;

Savina’s grandfather had been Romanian, and she’d learned a bit of the language before he passed, but she’d never been all that interested. Then they’d come around asking for orderlies who could cross-check Romanian documents for the new bridge they were building, and she got trained up on it properly. Of course, they eventually didn’t need her anymore, and Savina would’ve had to go back to her old clerical position, for worse pay… that is, until a man with a weaselly face came onto the job site looking for anyone who could learn a language quickly. She raised a hand and said she knew Romanian, and he snapped her up then and there.

&nbsp;

It was difficult, but she’d managed to pick up a working professional vocabulary in Spanish within a short few months of intensive study. It was really similar to Romanian in a lot of ways, and Savina knew she’d never have reached her level of fluency so quickly without the head start. The accelerated curriculum was on behalf of the factory she’d been poached by, of course; they made dehumidifiers, and needed an accurate translator for all the technical documentation. Apparently there was a big demand for them in Argentina? It was crazy for her to think of people half a world away reading something she’d written, but Savina had gotten her accreditation and now that would be happening. 

&nbsp;

She strode out of the building with a smile that outshone the noonday sun.

&nbsp;

*****

&nbsp;

“Apostolov, off the line!”

&nbsp;

The manager’s barked order signaled the end of Radovan’s first shift, and the start of his lunch break. He stepped out of the line and doffed his hairnet and gloves, letting a trickle of sweat drip down the hook of his nose. The ovens kept the inside of the factory hot even in the dead of winter, churning out byurek and other pastries made with filo. Not the hardest work but certainly monotonous, and he always came home smelling like sesame and spinach.

&nbsp;

His Lyuba had packed him lunch, as usual. She’d gotten on his case for just having a couple of cigarettes while on his break, wanted him to be healthier. She’d found more time now that they could leave Matey at the daycare, so she didn’t need to walk him halfway out of town to her nana’s house and back. They still visited on the weekends, of course — nana would have it no other way.

&nbsp;

Radovan watched the clock strike three, ate his pilaf, and let his mind wander.

&nbsp;

*****

&nbsp;

“Ioan, what the fuck is this?”

&nbsp;

His buddy just grinned, “I know right? It’s like a train wreck, you can’t look away.”

&nbsp;

“No, seriously. We’re not going to get in trouble for reading this, are we?” 

&nbsp;

Ioan scoffed, “I got this from higher up, they want the beat cops to have an idea of what we’re looking at if somebody starts passing out pamphlets somewhere. Unofficially, the Party doesn’t care because… well, who would ever be convinced by this?”

&nbsp;

True enough. Boško couldn’t see the screed put in front of him changing any minds at all, let alone being an actual threat to stability. *’Modern Revisionists Proceed Along the Treacherous Tracks of Social Democracy’* wasn’t exactly catchy, and the actual content was a confused mish-mash of jargon-filled accusations and self-aggrandizement. He had no idea that Albania’s premier was such a crackpot, and idly wondered what it would look like when Moscow’s hammer came down.

&nbsp;

He and Ioan spent the rest of the evening reading passages to each other in faux-seriousness, sparing occasional glances at the doorway to make sure the Chief didn’t walk in on them.

&nbsp;

*****

&nbsp;

Tsveta couldn’t sleep. She kept rolling over in bed, her mind running and running and running. She’d gotten the highest mathematics scores in her year in the *entire oblast*, and the headmaster said she’d get to go all the way to *Germany* to compete in a contest! Well, if her parents approved anyway, but her tatko had always let her have things if she pouted at him enough. Now her feet kept doing a little dance and she couldn’t keep her eyes closed. 

&nbsp;

Her friend Diana had shown her a postcard of Leipzig once. Her uncle had gone there on Party business and sent it to her father. She was going somewhere called Jena, but she wondered if it looked like Leipzig? She didn’t know German either, but apparently there would be government people who would translate things for her. Maybe she should take German when she got to secondary school? They might want her to work there if she did well in the competition — everyone knew how Germans got about math. 

&nbsp;

…were German boys cute? Would they like her if they saw she was good at math?

1penfq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/recruitinghell/comments/1penfq4/finally_landed_multiple_offers_after_1_year_of/,Finally landed multiple offers after 1+ year of job hunting: here is how I succeeded,"Hey Reddit! Recent grad here. I graduated this May, started job searching the summer before senior year, and just now began receiving multiple offers. 

After a lot of trial and error, here are the tips that ended up helping me the most. Obviously this is just what worked for me, but hopefully it helps someone.

1. If something isn’t working, change your approach (even if it’s uncomfortable.)

My biggest mistake was over-prepping. I’d write pages of responses, memorize perfect STAR stories, and try to script everything. By striving for perfection, I was missing the chance to genuinely connect with the interviewer. This is why I failed so many interviews.

I started succeeding once I focused on being more authentic and confident. I know everyone says that, and it used to annoy me because I didn’t know how to do it without memorizing perfect stories. What finally helped was this:

Take time to genuinely reflect on your strengths and achievements.
Think about how you’ve helped others, compliments you’ve received, and feedback from coworkers/managers. Even talk to former colleagues if it helps you pinpoint your strengths. Once you believe in them, communicating them becomes much more natural. These strengths become your “talking points,” which are easier to use than memorized stories.

Being good at interviews really comes down to knowing yourself deeply - what you value, what you’re looking for in a career, your strengths, and how your past experiences align with your goals. When you know yourself, you can answer almost any question authentically and naturally, and that’s how real connections form.

Trust yourself. Prep matters, but once you do the reflection above, you won’t need to prep nearly as much. Know your resume and experiences well, but don’t spend days memorizing, this burns you out and makes you sound robotic (technical interviews are the exception). Trust that you can think on your feet.

2. Referrals are the easiest path in. Networking works.

Hate to admit it, but LinkedIn Premium was worth it for me. I sent out 50+ connection requests a week and ended up forming meaningful relationships that led to referrals and, eventually, offers. I probably landed 20+ interviews through LinkedIn Premium cold messages. 

Also, don’t be afraid to stay in touch with interviewers at companies where you were rejected. I was rejected from a consulting firm before graduating, but I kept in touch with one interviewer who liked me. He later referred me to a colleague at another firm - which I ended up getting an offer at. You truly never know who will lead you to what.

3. Coffee chats build confidence.

As someone with zero family connections, networking felt daunting at first. But it helped me tremendously - not just with referrals, but with becoming a better interviewer. I scheduled at least three coffee chats a week. My goal wasn’t only to get referrals, but to get comfortable speaking professionally with senior leaders and sharing my story without pressure. It also helped me view seniors more as peers/mentors. By the time interviews came around, I felt much more comfortable being myself.

4. A lot of the outcomes are out of your control.

You can be a great interviewer but still not get the offer because of things happening behind the scenes. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve gone into an interview and immediately sensed they’d already chosen a candidate (bored, disinterested from the start). I’ve been ghosted after recruiters aggressively pursued me.

All you can do is reflect on what you could’ve improved, work on it, and move on.

Job searching sucks and can feel demoralizing at times but these tips helped me tremendously!

TL;DR:

Stop over-prepping and focus on genuinely knowing your strengths. Be authentic, not scripted. Networking and referrals matter a lot. Coffee chats build confidence. Some hiring decisions are out of your control, improve what you can.

# Coffee With Two Shots of Anxiety

***How My Social Anxiety Started a New Trend***

This isn’t a story of extreme triumph, or one with a dramatic ending. It’s about something so small it should never have its own story, but it does. It’s a story of how our brains can turn something so little, into the next Mount Everest. So, sit back and be prepared to feel better about yourself.

It was a warm summer day, and I was sitting on the beach. Wrong story. I was actually sitting in my freezing college apartment on a cold winter day. It was one of those days that had me contemplating cuddling up with the cockroaches just to stay warm. Luckily for me, my girlfriend was there instead. Out of boredom, we decided it was time for a coffee break.

Little did I know that these two words would lead to a story that stuck with me forever.

Withing minutes, we were running across the cold parking lot. We jumped into the wagon and turned the key. But nothing. No engine turning over, just dead. This should have been my omen. My car was warning us. The silence was actually a scream.

**“YOU’RE ABOUT TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF…STAY HOME! PLEASE!!!”**

Did I listen? Nah, not me. Instead, I found my neighbor and boosted my battery. Success! We are back on track. No need to avoid self-humiliation today.

Finally, we arrived at our favorite coffee shop. I won’t say any names, but let’s just say the place where they have everything, but a normal cup of coffee on the menu. Seriously, it is coffee; why do we need 200 types and none of them the one I want! That will be a rant for another day.

So here we are in line. Suddenly, my heart starts beating faster. There are three people in front of me. I pray somebody has a large order.

You see, I suffer from social anxiety. Having a girlfriend was about as far as my social skills went. I feared public interactions. Not because I disliked people, but due to me always putting my foot in my mouth.

How bad could it be though? It was only coffee, right?

So against all my wishes, the line blazes by. My girlfriend orders her Mocha Latte Frappe Skinny Oat Milk Double Frothed Venti Half-Caff monstrosity.

Now it’s my turn. The barista looked at me. Too friendly, too cheerful, too prepared for this interaction. My anxiety-ridden brain short-circuited. I forgot the name of the drink I get every morning of my life. My anxiety did what it always does. It put me into a panic and asked me to spin the fancy dictionary wheel. My brain screams at me,

**“You moron. Pick a word. Any word. Just pick one!”**

My throat gets tight and my mind goes blank. Who am I? What the heck am I doing here? Why can’t I remember the human language?

So the barista stands there, waiting for a simple response. She is likely in high school and just wants to go home. I’m ready though. I planned for this moment. Here I go. I replied with about as much confidence as a puppy running on a marble floor; slipping and flailing for dear life just to get that shiny new ball. After all my planning, this is all my brain could come up with:

**“Yes, could I please get warm cup of coffee?”**

No, that is not a typo. I was aiming for “one” coffee, but my brain decided it wasn’t on the same page. The barista stares at me with no words. I just want her to blink. Why won’t you blink! I can tell I broke her internal system. She needs a reboot.

Finally, she resets and tells me that their coffee is either hot or cold. What do I do? Do I admit my mistake?

Come on now. If you have read any of my stories, you would know my answer. I was like a degenerate gambler at the craps table. I doubled down, of course! With no word of a lie, this is all my socially awkward brain could spit out:

**“Oh, could you please put some ice into my black coffee? Hot coffee burns my tongue.”**

What? Why would you say that? Would I also like a warm blankie and a pacifier? Come on, brain, my girlfriend heard that! I just want to crawl into a cup of coffee and close the lid behind me.

At this point, I am almost ready to head to the airport and start over again. Somewhere warm, maybe the Cayman Islands? Fiji looks nice. Any place that wasn’t within an earshot of today would be fine.

At this point, I am ready to implode. My girlfriend’s eyes are burning my neck. I can see the question marks floating above the barista’s head. Then, right as I’m about to take off like Usain Bolt’s much slower cousin… something unexpected happens.

A man behind me giggles. Not out of hate, but because he was surprised how much he liked the idea of a warm coffee. He taps me on the shoulder and says,

**“Haha…what a great idea. I always wait 20 minutes to drink my coffee. You are brilliant!”**

Okay, okay. Maybe I added in the brilliant part. What matters is the rest is true. He proceeded to order the exact same thing I did. The barista shook off her confused look and started to make our coffees. And suddenly I wasn’t embarrassed anymore.

I wasn’t spiraling.

I wasn’t dying inside.

Not proud, not perfect. Just relieved.

Because here is a moment. One where I used my inferior language skills to put myself on an island. An island of anxiety and fear. Thinking the world was about to burn me at the stake. Instead, I found a new friend and we started a new trend together.

But most importantly, my fears didn’t come true. Nobody laughed at me. My girlfriend didn’t leave me. I didn’t die of embarrassment. Was I glowing like I just had a sleepover at Chernobyl? 100%. But it is also a story that will stick with me forever. One where I felt closer to society than ever before.

I continued to talk to my new friend as we waited for our perfectly tempered coffees. Then like a beautiful movie, my girlfriend and I walked off into the winter sunset with our coffees.

***I left feeling lighter. Not because everything went perfectly, but because it didn’t, and it was still okay. Better than okay, actually.***

Anxiety will always try to convince us that we are a neon sign. It will always make us feel like we are standing out. But the honest truth? Most people are too busy living their own lives to care. Some people might even laugh with you. Or, like in my case, some might start ordering “warm coffee” too.

***And sometimes that tiny moment, that blink of a connection, is all you need to remind you you’re not alone.***

With a warm coffee in my hand, I wish you goodbye for now.

With all my love and support.

Remember, you deserve more than a life. You deserve happiness.

He was dissappionted and was hurt, he said I broke his trust. 
Context:  last night we were somewhere, his playing his cards while I was at the bar counter chilling and waiting for him. 

few hours later...

A guy approach me and politely offered me a drink through one of his guard,, I was parch cuz its been hours since I finish mine.. I wanted to decline but I wanted to accept it more and so I did.. I went to the guy and said hi and thanks for offering, I also told him in advance that I am with someone my Boyfriend whose currently playing cards just incase he thought of hitting on me..  because we all know  what this kind of act is... And he said all good he was just offering cuz I been sitting hours without a drink and offered one without malice... 
 he was also with his other friend who was kind and understood what I meant. So i felt okay they seem fine we had friendly conversation like ""how are you"" blah blah,..

in my mind since i drew the line the conversation were having is literally just for the purpose of ""socializing with no malice on"" 

My bf then came, he looks puzzled but I introduced him to the guys  and told him about them.. At first I thought it was okay then I felt him being distant... 

after the game we went back to the apt and tgere he was real distant, giving me silent treatment and wouldnt say he loves me back... 

This morning he went to his phone and ordered coffee without mine.. he also left me in the apt without money or food for today and went to his cards cus he has to go by 12 ... 


Now im here alone starving trying to assess my situation... 

Any advise is welcome go on all you want I need to know is this something I deserve or what?

1pendnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/GoMiningDiscussion/comments/1pendnz/my_2_cents_on_lock_and_long_term_investing_in/,My 2 cents on Lock (and long term investing in general),"This is my personal opinion and I am not any kind of investing or math expert - if one is reading this, please confirm or shoot down this concept.   
  
Investing is a tough thing to start, especially in a ""buy buy buy"", ""keeping up with the Joneses'"" culture. Missing out on a few things (dare I say sacrifce?) now will result in so much more later. The cliche is true - your older self will thank you.

At max/4years, the Lock is currently getting \~35% return paid weekly. This is an insane rate - more than the worst credit cards charge.  
  
A lot of people think adding a a few $ isn't worth it - that's true if you need the $ right now to eat, or really want that $5+ coffee every day or 7th pair of shoes. I think most people can add a little something consistently <<<consistency, habit is the key, not the actual amount you invest.

Here's what $10 (\~30 GMT) / month locked for max - assuming 30% return - would do:

* After 1 year, you’d invest $120 and end up with ≈ $131.13
* After 5 years, you’d invest $600 and end up with ≈ $820.67
* After 10 years, you’d invest $1,200 and end up with ≈ $4,963.96 - 4x your investment for doing nothing but missing out on a minor purchase once a month.

This assumes 30% (not the current \~35%) forever - the lock percent will fluxuate, but I can't imagine it will move much in the forseeable future. The average S&P 500 stock return is 8-10% per year on average. We're looking at more than 3 times that. 

Imagine if you could spare $20, $50, $100 a month? Then imagine you could do this for 20, 30, 40 years - That's a long time, especially if you're not as ancient as I am, but your retirement will be far better than your butt-busting for pennies current life. 

Can you find $10/month to forget about? Heck, I probably waste $10 every day (on average) on garbage I'll get nothing out of. 

What if you get a $1 raise - put half in to investment and enjoy the other half. 

$0.50 \*.65 (taxes) \* 40 hours = $13 / week (\~$56/month)  
 \- assumes full time work and 35% taken out for taxes, social security, etc.  
  
The lock is no joke if you're in this for the long term.

That being said, if you have debt, I'd focus on that first or at least mostly - get rid of monthly payments to the credit cards, then turn that into payments to your wallet.

One weekend set of plans. Be sure to share other ideas.,"It will be a busy weekend this weekend in Show Low and Pinetop as many of your towns kick off the Christmas season. 

Here’s some ideas:
Saturday there are various day activities going on at local shops and businesses. I’d start your mid day with a hike on the Show Low Meadow trail and check out the trees in the afternoon. It’s about 1.5 paved trail or hike the tree trail along the bluff.  Greet for pups.  At 4 pm head to the House for activities there and grab early lunch. 

At 6pm things will be happening downtown as the Light Parade gets rolling and concludes by Show Low city hall Downtown. 

The city maybe passing out maps of local homes decorated with lights at the downtown event. 

Sunday, there’s a Makers Market at the Arts Alliance around 11-3pm.  Depending on weather hit the Rim Trail around sunset for a spectacular view.  Caution it can be cold and windy. 

Sunday night the WM Chorale will perform Handel’s Messiah at the WM United Method Church, a mountain tradition to enjoy.  7pm. 

Monday, take a drive up to Greer or Sunrise for a little more white stuff. As well as visit your local coffee shops. Pinetop will have lights up at their parks as well. Check out some of the cute shops in Old Pinetop. 

Enjoy.

# Coffee With Two Shots of Anxiety

***How My Social Anxiety Started a New Trend***

This isn’t a story of extreme triumph, or one with a dramatic ending. It’s about something so small it should never have its own story, but it does. It’s a story of how our brains can turn something so little, into the next Mount Everest. So, sit back and be prepared to feel better about yourself.

It was a warm summer day, and I was sitting on the beach. Wrong story. I was actually sitting in my freezing college apartment on a cold winter day. It was one of those days that had me contemplating cuddling up with the cockroaches just to stay warm. Luckily for me, my girlfriend was there instead. Out of boredom, we decided it was time for a coffee break.

Little did I know that these two words would lead to a story that stuck with me forever.

Withing minutes, we were running across the cold parking lot. We jumped into the wagon and turned the key. But nothing. No engine turning over, just dead. This should have been my omen. My car was warning us. The silence was actually a scream.

**“YOU’RE ABOUT TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF…STAY HOME! PLEASE!!!”**

Did I listen? Nah, not me. Instead, I found my neighbor and boosted my battery. Success! We are back on track. No need to avoid self-humiliation today.

Finally, we arrived at our favorite coffee shop. I won’t say any names, but let’s just say the place where they have everything, but a normal cup of coffee on the menu. Seriously, it is coffee; why do we need 200 types and none of them the one I want! That will be a rant for another day.

So here we are in line. Suddenly, my heart starts beating faster. There are three people in front of me. I pray somebody has a large order.

You see, I suffer from social anxiety. Having a girlfriend was about as far as my social skills went. I feared public interactions. Not because I disliked people, but due to me always putting my foot in my mouth.

How bad could it be though? It was only coffee, right?

So against all my wishes, the line blazes by. My girlfriend orders her Mocha Latte Frappe Skinny Oat Milk Double Frothed Venti Half-Caff monstrosity.

Now it’s my turn. The barista looked at me. Too friendly, too cheerful, too prepared for this interaction. My anxiety-ridden brain short-circuited. I forgot the name of the drink I get every morning of my life. My anxiety did what it always does. It put me into a panic and asked me to spin the fancy dictionary wheel. My brain screams at me,

**“You moron. Pick a word. Any word. Just pick one!”**

My throat gets tight and my mind goes blank. Who am I? What the heck am I doing here? Why can’t I remember the human language?

So the barista stands there, waiting for a simple response. She is likely in high school and just wants to go home. I’m ready though. I planned for this moment. Here I go. I replied with about as much confidence as a puppy running on a marble floor; slipping and flailing for dear life just to get that shiny new ball. After all my planning, this is all my brain could come up with:

**“Yes, could I please get warm cup of coffee?”**

No, that is not a typo. I was aiming for “one” coffee, but my brain decided it wasn’t on the same page. The barista stares at me with no words. I just want her to blink. Why won’t you blink! I can tell I broke her internal system. She needs a reboot.

Finally, she resets and tells me that their coffee is either hot or cold. What do I do? Do I admit my mistake?

Come on now. If you have read any of my stories, you would know my answer. I was like a degenerate gambler at the craps table. I doubled down, of course! With no word of a lie, this is all my socially awkward brain could spit out:

**“Oh, could you please put some ice into my black coffee? Hot coffee burns my tongue.”**

What? Why would you say that? Would I also like a warm blankie and a pacifier? Come on, brain, my girlfriend heard that! I just want to crawl into a cup of coffee and close the lid behind me.

At this point, I am almost ready to head to the airport and start over again. Somewhere warm, maybe the Cayman Islands? Fiji looks nice. Any place that wasn’t within an earshot of today would be fine.

At this point, I am ready to implode. My girlfriend’s eyes are burning my neck. I can see the question marks floating above the barista’s head. Then, right as I’m about to take off like Usain Bolt’s much slower cousin… something unexpected happens.

A man behind me giggles. Not out of hate, but because he was surprised how much he liked the idea of a warm coffee. He taps me on the shoulder and says,

**“Haha…what a great idea. I always wait 20 minutes to drink my coffee. You are brilliant!”**

So I measured, tinkered and after about 6 revision, came up with this model.  It's not the prettiest, but it works well, fits well and allows the glasses to still be foldable.

The only drawback is that this adaptor will block the port for the XREAL Eye, so keep that in mind.

I printed this on a Creality CR6SE at 100% infill.  Supports and adhesion settings optional, but I used a brim and tree supports.

1pen7ha,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1pen7ha/aith_for_sleeping_with_my_buddys_ex/,AITH for sleeping with my buddys ex?,"TLDR: My buddy cheated on his ex that he doesnt care about and then she asked me to hang out as freinds, she started cuddling me and we ended up in her bed.

Hello everyone, id like to apologize for the rambled story and possible mistakes with spelling. Names have been changed but sound very close to their real names. Heres the story

I 21M have a buddy ill call Bill 42M and his ex kenzie 20F. They broke up a few days ago because hes been cheating aanddoesnt give her attention. I first met them about 2-3 years ago, when I was engaged to my ex. Her and kenzie were freinds and we spent alot of time with them.

Long story short, we moved away to another town for 8 months before i broke up with her and moved back home. I hadnt seen Bill and Kenzie as they were my exs freind and had moved to another house. About a year after I moved back, i was washing my towtruck at the truck wash behind a lady washing her bus. I reconized her but couldnt quite place where i knew her from. I continued washing my truck when i heard her yell in excitement ""OMG IT IS YOU"". I will admit, she gained weight and it took a minute for me to reconize her, but it was Kenzie. 

I was almost certian that Bill and Kenzie didnt like me as they wrre freinds with my ex fiance before i knew them, but they didnt hold anything against me. We began catching up on life before she invited me over to her place to have dinner with her and Bill. I declined as im not a social person. 

Fast forward 2 weeks and i got a call for work, i had to pick up a truck from a competitors yard. They were waiting for me when i arrived. It was Bill, he was working at the rival towing company. We started chatting, exchanged numbers and he taught me alot about towing. We ended up hanging out alot, going for coffee and helping each other out on jobs. Eventually i started hanging out with him at his shop, fixing trucks until 6am and stuff like that. Weve got a bunch of freinds in the group that hangout at the shop with us, Grady 25M being the one that hangs out the most. Well, Grady cant stand Kenzie (she rejected him when she was a minor cuz he was an adult and since then he cant stand her). 

I found out that Bill cheats on Kenzie alot. I was obviously told that nothing leaves the shop that is said in the shop. But its clear that hes been cheating on her and wanting to leave for awhile. Grady has been very loud about his thoughts, calling Bill a limp dick and such for not leaving Kenzie, and encourages his cheating. Although ive wanted to tell her, its not my place and i didnt want her to tell Bill that i said anything.. yes im an asshole in this regard but thats not what im asking about in this post. 

Anyways, kenzie caught Bill texting other women a few days ago and she dumped him. He doesnt care and has been yelling at her (she has videos).  He has been telling lies to us acting all calm and collected telling the groupchat that they just grew apart and she found texts of a girl flirting with him but he made it clear he had a girlfreind.. which couldnt be further from the truth. 

I found out all this after kenzie and i hung out last night. We went for coffee in my truck and talked for 2 hours, she made it clear we are freinds and shes tired of all Bills freinds trying to get into her pants. I understand how annoying that is and had no intentions of hitting on her at all. We even talked about how we arent each others types. Then we had made plans to hang out the next day since we were both off. 

Today, i slept in, snapping her a few times and she kept asking when we were going to hang out. I honestly didnt feel like hanging out but she said we could watch movies or play games. Id had a few 14+ hour work days in a row and thought that playing games or watching a movie sounded relaxing, besides wed had long conversations before and I enjoy telling her about everything in my life. The conversations flow, they never seem to end. 

She sent me 3 snaps before i decided to head over. all 3 were her in a bra showing alot of cleavage. Now.. ladies i know your going to think this is obvious and you know what shes doing. But im sure guys can agree with me i found this a bit odd, but she complained about guys trying to get with her, so why would she be trying to get with me? Im just porn brained and need to grow up i thought as i put my phone away and headed over.

 She invited me in, i sat on the couch across from her and we began watching a movie. About half way in i realized she had moved pretty close, about 6 inches away after being all the way on the other side, i started paying attentikn to how she was moving. Shed pet the dog and act like the dog was pushing her in my direction. Then she would stretch and move closer to me. Our legs were touching, her arm on my stomache. She then laid her head on my shoulder/chest.

I knew at this point that she had to have known what she was doing. Keep in mind that i didnt move a muscle since the movie started. It was all fine until she got a call from Bill. They talked about her having the kids (his kids not hers) for christmas and she began to cry as she was happy. She got up and left the room to call her mom to tell her about how theyd have the kids for christmas. At this point i was alone in the room, 6 minutes left of the movie still in the same position as when id first sat down. I looked up at the ceiling, wondering what the fuck im doing. 

After about 15 minutes she comes back in the room. Kenzie began apologizing for leaving and wiped away tears, she asked if id like a glass of water. I said yes, we talked in the kitchen but she was out of water. We laughed and she offered a tour of the house. Its a duplex, not very big so about 5 minutes later we end up in her room which she passed 3 times to show me other parts of the house. Clearly she wanted to show me her room last and this fact wasnt lost on me in the moment. I sat on her bed and so did she. We talked for an hour, getting closer to each other.

 Eventually she started rubbing my arm, tracing her fingers along my tattoos, and putting her fingers in the holes of my clothes. Im dumb, but im not stupid. I knew what she was doing. She offered me a back massage and i didnt pass up on the offer. Shes got very strong hands and rubbed my back for 15 minutes. Then i stood up and put my shirt back on. We locked eyes, she looked away nervously and commented that her room smells like old people now (she used A535). I kind of chuckled and began to say sorry when she cut me off saying ""it would be better if my room smelled like sex instead"". My mind went blank, i asked what she had said. She kept laughing and kept brushing it off. I closed the door and hugged her, asked what she said once more. She laughed again and tried to say ""nothing"". i moved my hands around her waist to the front of her pants, and began teasing her. She moaned and we fell back onto the bed. I wont get into the details but it happened.

 She says she really liked it but that she isnt ready. I feel like an ass because its my buddys ex and she wasnt ready. Let me make this perfectly clear, she wanted it. No doubt. I kept asking her if she wants me to stop. Every few minutes id stop and as her if she wants me to keep going or stop and she begged me not to stop. 

Now weve been texting and we want to slow this down. Idk what to do. Be honest. Am i the asshole?",1,1764913473.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

I’m a PhD student (M28). I struggle heavily with ""starting resistance""-- that wall you hit before doing complex work. I have a bad habit of daily procrastination, usually doom-scrolling Reddit/Twitter or seeking cheap dopamine (porn) whenever I get stressed or bored. I decided to finally try L-Tyrosine and L-Theanine for this.

First, a warning: I messed up immediately. I was excited to start, so I took the L-Tyrosine (500mg) and L-Theanine (200mg) together at 9 PM the night before yesterday night. Huge mistake. I got this weird tired but restless feeling and had vivid, nightmarish sleep. I woke up after two hours and couldn't settle. Next morning, I felt groggy and heavy, almost like I was hungover from an extreme weed session.

The next day which is today, I took 500mg of L-Tyrosine on an empty stomach right when I woke up. 50 minutes later I took a cup of black coffee and 200mg of L-Theanine.

Then, I started my workday.

At the end of the day, the first thing I noticed was what I didn't do. I didn't scroll Reddit once. I didn't look at porn today, which is usually a daily struggle for me. I just... worked. That massive resistance I usually feel before starting a task just wasn't there. I felt locked in.

But the real test happened in the lab this afternoon.
I discovered that all the cells I had sorted after a grueling 5-6 hour experiment two days ago were contaminated. Basically, days of hard work went down the drain instantly. Normally, this would break me. I’d spiral into stress, give up for the day, and go home to numb myself with screens.
But today it was easy to ignore the stress and think pragmatically. I looked at the dead cells, didn't panic, and immediately made a troubleshooting plan to find the source of the contamination. I felt clinical about the failure rather than emotional. I just started over.

A few questions for the vets here:

* It this just placebo or a beginner's thing and will it just go away?
 * Is running this Mon-Fri with weekends off enough to avoid tolerance?
 * Anything to be careful about? Any general tips? Any heads up?

Can't sleep past usually 4-5 hours without waking up and then can't go back to sleep. Though those hours are pretty deep and i dont wake up. Stuggled with those for years,  ive tried ton of supplaments. Sleep hygiene is great,  lights, noises, temp. Don't drink coffee dont smoke, no crazy amount of food before sleep etc.

  
When I wake up I sometimes have strong heart beat, then brains goes into work mode but I dont feel anxiety, consciously at least. I've also done CBT sleep therapy didnt saw great effect. From time to time I sleep 6 and a half hours straight maybe but like once a month. Would like for this to be my normal. From what I've gathered over the years I think its a cortisol spike during the morning hours that happens normally but it fucks me up , usually around 3-4 am and prolly is tied with anxiety or just real life pace and I dont seem to be able to cool down.

Any suggestions? Haven't gone the pills route yet, for anxiety or depression etc.

I walked in with my iced coffee, already bracing myself for the usual morning chaos. The store was quiet for once, just the hum of the coolers and the soft thump of the stockroom door closing behind the opener. I took a second to breathe before clocking in. I should have known that moment of peace was a warning.

About an hour into the shift the sky outside turned the kind of dark that makes you wonder if the weather app is lying again. The wind started pushing the carts across the parking lot and one slammed into the front doors so hard the windows rattled. A customer walked up just in time to see it and backed away like the cart was alive. I could not blame them. I would have turned around too if I had the choice.

We kept working because that is what we do. I was zoning the candy wall when the power flickered once and went out completely. The whole store exhaled at the same time. A second later one emergency light kicked on in the middle of aisle seven and everything else stayed black. I could hear customers talking but could not see a single face. It felt like being underwater.

My manager came out of the office with the flashlight we keep taped to the desk for exactly this reason. The battery was half dead and the beam looked like it was trying its best but needed a nap. Customers were getting restless and a few were trying to shop in the dark even though we told them we could not ring anything up.

Then something totally unexpected happened. One of the regulars, the older guy who always buys crossword books and tells us corny jokes, pulled out this massive work light from his backpack. It looked like something a mechanic would use. He clicked it on and the whole front half of the store lit up. Everyone stared at him like we had just been rescued by a very kind, slightly eccentric superhero.

With his help we guided people to the doors and kept everyone calm until the power finally came back on. When the lights returned the whole store gave this weird half cheer, half sigh. The regular just shrugged like it was nothing, placed his crossword on the counter, and told us he figured someone would need it someday.

When he left, my manager and I just stood there for a minute letting the chaos settle. The shift still ended up being long, messy, and loud, just like always, but that moment made the whole day feel different. Working here can be stressful, ridiculous, and thankless, but sometimes someone surprises you in the best way.

And honestly, a shift with a surprise hero is better than any slow day I could have asked for.",6,1764912759.0,DollarTree,1,1.0,False

Why is this?,"So I've only ever smoked just 2 cigarettes in my entire life and the last time I hit a vape was several months ago and the last time before that was several months before that and the last time before that was 2 years and the last time before that was 1 year. So cigarettes is almost never and vapes have months to years long gaps between. I by no means consider myself a true smoker since it's such a rare occasion for me. 

But because its such a rare occasion for me, I should not have a high nicotine tolerance. But it seems I do anyway since almost every time I've ever smoked or vaped I never got any nicotine buzz? I only got a nicotine buzz the very first 2 or 3 times I vaped ever. Afterwards the nicotine buzz stopped for life. The only reason I ever tried a cigarette was out of curisiouty or vaped again at all was because it tasted good. But I never got nicotine buzzes despite months to years long gaps in between a hit.

Recently, I decided to try nicotine gum and nicotine patches. I did the nicotine gum correctly and wore the nicotine patch for the max amount of time. Same thing, nothing happened. No nicotine buzz.

It's not just nicotine. I have a similar thing with caffeine. The amount of caffeine in standard coffees has no effect on me despite the fact I've always been an occasional caffeine drinker, never a regular caffeine dribker, but it still has no effect on me at standard doses. I need to literally od or almost od on caffeine in order to feel any effects. It's the same thing where even if I go a long time without caffeine then drink it again I still feel nothing.

It feels like she doesn’t care.,"(TLDR at the bottom, sorry it’s so ranty. Idk how else to communicate my situation right now)

Recently I, immunocompromised, got sick from my in-laws bringing their sick daughter to Thanksgiving and I didn’t know until when, that night, the daughter told me herself. 

I am now sick.

I do not have sick leave left for work. I used the last of it Tuesday. Work is requiring me to come in and work every day, 9 to 5:30. I cannot function. I’m too sapped. I cannot think. I’m worried about getting in trouble and spreading the illness. It’s all made worse by my adhd. I literally have done nothing but sit at my desk and try to stay awake each workday so far and must report what I’ve completed by the end of the day Friday.

I desperately purchased and drank a cold brew coffee in the next door building thinking it could help me function better (since caffeine has been proven to help people with adhd concentrate and I have no meds and am sleep deprived), but it affected my Crohn’s, making me have the runs now and feel even weaker.

I got home desperate to shower (I was freezing and also hadn’t showered that morning) and sleep and care for myself so I could function Friday/tomorrow. My wife knows I’m sick but wanted me to walk both of our dogs when I came home because she was busy making dinner. I did it despite feeling like I couldn’t. Then I showered and ate the dinner: Legitimately was just 5 chicken nuggets and a few edamame beans. I didn’t realize how little that really was until now. I think I’m delirious. Idk how she eats so little. I didn’t have an appetite anyways.

I crawl into bed, finally warm and showered all comfy in shorts, then, after a few minutes she asks me if I’m going to bed, asking me to instead watch the dogs so she can shower and go to bed because her thumb and tooth hurts. She wouldn’t elaborate when I asked. 

I asked her if she could please just walk the dogs the last time they need before she gets warm in the shower because I finally showered and got warm and was wearing shorts and sick and it’s winter. 

She asked me to because her thumb and her wanting to go to bed. She’s not sick. And I told her several times I’m feeling delirious before I went to bed. I understand why she’d want to go to bed since she wakes every morning at 4am for work, but this thumb thing is not making any sense and she had told me that she’s taking tomorrow off just before she went to bed!

I pressed her about her thumb as she was showering and she said it felt like there was a feeling like a splinter under the nail but that she doesn’t see anything, and that she thinks her root canal might be infected and that she might take tomorrow off to get it checked out. Then she gets out and goes to bed. 

I continue now, staying up into the night, sick and going back and forth to the toilet, needing to unclog it once, re-showering every time I use the toilet, and overall just having a really tough time and wanting to sleep because I have to work again tomorrow and MUST complete stuff to report on.

It feels like she doesn’t care about me. And now I’m about to take these dogs out so they don’t wake her up in the middle of the night despite it being cold and winter and despite me being continually wet from this darn shower and needing to change to bundle up for it.

My coworker asked me why I don’t just let the neighbors walk our dogs because something similar happened yesterday. We live in an apartment complex. I can’t expect them to come over and walk them late at night. 

Only thing I can think of doing is taking away the free feed kibble (they are good at not overeating and stay a healthy weight) and put them on a schedule so the younger one can predictably poop earlier in the day. He’s so skinny and yet he poops every 3 hours except for when he’s kenneled while we’re at work. It’s nuts. Idk how he’s not overweight with how much he poops.

Anyways, 

**TLDR**: I’m needing to work while very ill but cannot function AT ALL at work, and my wife knows this and is still asking me to do stuff for her for reasons that just don’t make any sense like saying she can’t help walk the dogs because a splinter feeling in her thumb?? I feel like she’s aware of my suffering. I’ve voiced it.

My question: What in the heck do I need to communicate to more fully express that I need her help better despite her also not feeling well? 

This is ridiculous, right? I’m not crazy? Maybe she’s feeling worse than I thought? Maybe she’s not thinking I’m that bad myself?",1,1764912414.0,Marriage,6,1.0,False

my friends keep saying i center him too much, and even my bf lowkey thinks i think about the relationship “too much.” but like… i literally work a 9-5, have a part time job, i’m a full time uni student taking 6 classes, i’m a brand new immigrant trying to adjust, i hit the gym, i do pilates. i’m not exactly sitting around hyper-fixating on him all day. yeah i’m kinda clingy and needy sometimes but like… i deserve love too no?

and because i’m earning in usd, i get to spoil him more. i bring him coffee/food almost daily, i send him random gifts, i spend a decent amount on him every week. he’s a student with no income yet so i don’t expect him to match me. he still gets me fresh flowers and starbucks sometimes, which i appreciate. i guess financially i understand the imbalance, but emotionally it feels kinda one-sided. like i don’t really get love letters, cute messages, praise, or much affection from him. i also usually set up and plan our date nights. 

recently, when i’ve been feeling extra needy he gets stressed out and says i’m bringing him “so much problems.” he keeps saying he’s tired from school and worried about his future, and that he doesn’t feel established yet. he’s also mentioned that he feels pressure because i’m already earning in a first world country while he’s still just trying to barely survive uni. i get it, but it still hurts that me wanting closeness makes him feel overwhelmed instead of loved.

tldr: i spoil my long distance bf a lot and try really hard in the relationship, but when i get needy or want more affection he gets stressed and says i’m “too much,” and now i'm just sad because i really, really just want some good loving ",0,1764912285.0,relationships,17,0.5,False

Well, this is my most active year since turning 40. Now that the last, best prospect has gone the same way as all the previous, I figure now is a good time to reflect on my year as a whole and share my thoughts.

January: I had a coffee date with a lady that went ok, nothing amazing. I think both of us were just thinking the other was a nice person, probably wouldn't mind being co-workers, but that's it. Mutual unmatch.

Lesson: some dates are just dull but fine, you move on.

February-April: I didn't date. I did spend a few weeks in Japan, and that was a great time, which is what gave me the energy to make such a go of it for the rest of the year.

Lesson: Breaks are great, important and refreshing, so long as they aren't permanent.

May: I match with a belly dancer. Has kids, great rapport, we share a lot of hobbies. Due to her kids graduations, we had 2 weeks between first and second date, talked at length in both directions each day (a fellow long texter.) Second date was great, about 6 hours, but towards the end she tells me that despite her hinge saying monogamy, she is actually not looking for monogamy, she wanted to try ENM and also experiment with girls after coming out of a suffocating marriage since she was 21, only person she had ever dated before me. First date after a divorce is always doomed. Posted about her here regarding the disparate emotional investment.

Lesson: Don't invest emotion in someone you haven't even kissed yet.

June: very quick texting phase, went out for drinks with a dog groomer that said she hated dogs, would not look me in the eye, and said her hobby was ""being outside"" without elaborating on what that meant when I inquired. When we were done with out first drink, which was very fast, maybe 15 minutes, she asked if I wanted another and I said I was good, nice to meet her and left. Posted about that one here too, it weirdly got 148K views. This was actually my first post here.

Lesson: It's fine to be the one that says no, it doesn't always have to be the lady making that decision.

July: Matched with a woman that had a killer personality, funny, smart. Went on a date with her, turns out her real personality is almost surly, and she had been using ChatGPT to text with me, so essentially, cat fishing with AI. Also a very fast date. Also posted about this one here.

Lesson: AI is a blight on the universe, and I am REALLY sick of it invading everything.

August: I got three matches at the same time, and at the encouragement of almost everyone I know, I decided to juggle first dates. First was an artist that I quite liked, second was a video game designer that clearly quite liked me, the third was a gothy lady that works at a hospital. The artist made plans with me, her idea, but then cancelled the second date last minute, never heard from her again. The game designer I had a second date with and I really wanted to like, but it was more cool sister vibes than anything romantic on my end (no spark, essentially) and let her down gently after the second date. The gothy girl was cute but kind of socially inept, and she ghosted after the date anyway. I wrote about them here too.

Lesson: multi-dating is doable, and likely a good barrier to getting feelings hurt, but it's also kind of exhausting. AND I learned what it's like to be on the sending side of a ""no spark"" let down.

September: Had a beer with a naturopathic doctor. I also got the impression she was a habitual liar. Said her father was one of the founders of cisco systems, but looking that up after the date, that appeared to be false. Said she was between jobs, which seems odd for a doctor. Said she had spent time in Korea teaching at the same time I was there teaching, but didn't seem to remember any details that anyone who lived in Korea would know. All around bad vibes. She asked me out on a second date and I declined. I didn't write about this one, I was dealing with other things at the time that I almost forgot this date even happened. I also had two other first dates, one with a personal trainer and another with a phlebotomist. Both of those were fine but sorta boring dates, like the first one this year.

I also got my ADHD diagnosis around here and started medications.

Lesson: some folks are super weird. I guess already knew that.

October: Went out with a fellow government employee. Instant chemistry, really enjoyed each others company, she tells me I'm easy to talk to. Leans on me while I walk her to her car. We talk quite a bit between dates, go on a second date, and I get my first kiss of the year. She says yes to coming over to my place for a third date that next week. The next day, she texts to cancel saying she is too anxious to come over due perceived expectations on how the night will go. I let her know that not the case, no expectations are there, but still peaces out. No problem. I'm bummed out bcause I thought a kiss would mean...something, I guess. Later that day, she texts to uncancel and wants to have the third date. I offer to do it somewhere other than my apartment, but she says she wants to come over, have dinner and cuddle watching a movie. Ok, sure, I try to say yes to possibilities. The next morning she texts again to cancel again, citing a lack of chemistry. I am annoyed at this point and text that clearly there is something wrong with me (which I shouldn't have.) I block and delete her contact. I wrote about that one.

Lesson: I don't fucking know. Maybe that I'm a bad kisser anymore?

Early November: Meet a travel consultant and a big time lefty socialist, just like me. We have a great first date talking about politics and charity and have a ton of shared interests. We have a dinner dates for the second date, goes fine but I noticed her face fall and the lights go out of her eyes when I mention I rent instead of own a home. We don't kiss, I didn't even try, the vibes were off. We still flirt a bit for the next few days before she finally tells me that she likes to be wined and dined and made to feel like a princess, and is looking for a guy to care for her ""including financial care"" and I clearly wasn't it. Posted about that one too, sorta. It was more an example in a different subject. The contradictions between the socialism and the weird sugar daddy greed was repulsive, especially the more I think about it. I feel dirty for meeting her.

Lesson: While I refuse to believe the sexist bullshit about so many women being gold diggers, I must admit I met at least one.

Late November-December: The last one. A special needs teacher and also my literal neighbor from a block away. We met two weeks ago, had an awkward first date where I kind of assumed another failure and talked about the stuff you avoid on a first date, like past dates and ex's and stuff. She also talked about her ex and bit. She was nice, but I went home thinking that was a one off. However, she reaches out the next day with her phone number. We continue to talk, and we start flirting in a way that I usually wouldn't after only a first date. Maybe still having a 'fuck it, why not' energy. We have dinner for the second date, make out by her car. She kisses me with hunger. It's really nice. She comes over for a third date two days later, we hook up, my first time in over six years. We are super sweet texting each other the next day, and I post about her here to be a nice little blog because I was feeling happy. Then she gets home from work, her ex sent her some package or something, and she suddenly isn't ready to date anymore. I send a panic text that was surely too long and I write about that here too. She responds, it's over, been nice, see ya. I post one last time here to show the conclusion. That was yesterday. And this morning, my doctor told me I have a kidney stone. Sex, breakup, kidney stone. Hell of a week.

Lesson: There are several. First, I am still attractive enough and have enough personality to sleep with. That was something I've worried about for some time with such a long dry spell. I was really thinking people found the idea of sex with me repulsive. It's nice to have been proven wrong.

Second, I need to edit my texts better. Apparently, sending long texts is something only monsters do according to the majority of you folks, haha.

Third: Despite some folks here armchair diagnosing me based on some pretty inaccurate assumptions, I was relatively calm throughout all of it and remained kind despite the fact that I was pretty hurt by the whiplash, so the ADHD medications were really helping me through it. I know I wrote a lot yesterday, but that doesn't always mean panic or spiraling. I think the comments I replied to show that.

Ok, so, overall, it's actually been a positive year, even if it was a bit draining. I went from bland coffee dates to having a pretty lady in my bed. That is not bad. I wish I got an actually relationship out of the deal, as I'm not just looking to get laid, but that is just how it goes.

Despite my earlier posts and comments this week while I was in it, I'm actually quite satisfied with how this year has gone. And I must say that writing about it the past months has be extremely helpful, especially in offering perspectives and points of view that I'd not have considered otherwise. The great majority of you have been kind, some have been harsh, and only a few have been total dicks, and honestly for reddit, that's not the worst ratio.

So, thank you for reading my posts, commenting on them, giving advise and perspectives. I am wrapping up this dating season, gonna sleep for the winter I think, contemplate what I've learned, try to find the right balance for me which will likely be a different balance than it is for anyone else, and next year give it another go, hopefully with the same tenacity I had through this year.

For those that are single and post things that sound like you are in despair, I just want to say that I see you, and others see you, and I encourage folks to not give in and give up. Progress is slow, and there are no guarantees, and there is no perfect, but there is better, and if I can grow this year as much as I have, despite my stumbles, then so can anyone.",5,1764911922.0,datingoverforty,6,1.0,False

1pemky8,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1pemky8/espresso_machine_for_coffee_cart_but_also_home/,"Espresso machine for coffee cart but also home use [$4,000]","Hey everyone,

I’m currently running a very bare-bones coffee cart setup using my home Breville Bambino. It’s been great for getting started, but I’m ready to upgrade to a more entry-level commercial that I can use both:
	•	On my coffee cart at events
	•	At home when I’m not working events

My main requirements are:
	•	Budget: Around $4,000 USD
	•	Dual boiler: To improve workflow and be able to steam and pull shots efficiently
	•	Rotary pump: For quieter operation and better long-term reliability
	•	Plumbing flexibility: Ideally able to be direct-plumbed on the cart, but also run off a reservoir at home

My dream machine would be a La Marzocco Linea Mini, but that’s unfortunately out of budget.

I’ve been looking at the Lucca A53 (both the tank and direct-plumb versions). The issues I’m running into are:
	•	The direct plumb version seems like it can’t be used with a reservoir at all, which would make home use difficult.
	•	The tank version uses a vibratory pump, which I’m not super excited about, but I’m wondering if that’s just something I might have to accept at this price point.

So I’m stuck between these trade-offs and wanted to ask:

Are there any other machines you’d recommend that fit (or come close to) these requirements?
Dual boiler, rotary pump, can be plumbed in on the cart but also run off a tank at home, and around $4k?

Any suggestions or personal experiences with similar setups would be really appreciated.

By all accounts we should be much better off now with a kid in college (she works too and still lives at home, but we no longer have all of her club soccer expenses, travel expenses, tuition, lunch fees, etc).

One day, Lady Sandrone was brushing her hair; the loose hairs that fell out fell to the ground, grew, propagated, and spread, and are what we now know as ""grass.""

2. Lady Sandrone invited the Hexenzirkel Witches for a tea party once, but they declined knowing they weren't refined enough ladies to sit at The Marionette's table.

3. Lady Sandrone once saved an Inazuman ""game developer's"" cat from a house-fire; in her honour, the man named his game's protagonist ""Mario"" in honour of The **Mario**nette.

4. There came a day when Lady Sandrone was tired of walking around, so she found an elevated surface, turned her back to it, and bent her knees until her posterior was resting on the aforementioned elevated surface—this was the invention of what we now know as ""sitting down.""

5. On a fateful night, while Lady Sandrone was out on a maidenly stroll, she cast her gaze upon the moon, at which point the moon grew brighter due to reflecting the radiance of The Marionette's cool, deep-blue eyes—this moon is now known as ""the Frost Moon.""

6. Lady Sandrone takes 3 minutes and 12 seconds to cook 5-minute ramen.

7. People might wonder why The Marionette is ""only"" the 7th of the Eleven, or even mock her for it, but the truth is that she could easily procure a higher spot if she wants, she simply stays near the middle because she believes that a refined young lady like herself should remain close and connected to the ~~peasants~~ **general populace**.

8. Lady Sandrone developed a supercomputer once upon a time and sent it into space, that supercomputer is now known through the universe as ""Nous, the Erudition."" Note that a scheming man of name ""Zandar One Kuwabara"" has falsely taken credit for The Marionette's creation, but she doesn't care because this petty computer isn't even one of her best works anyways.

9. The Marionette is an inimitable beauty, to the point where any mirrors she looks in crack or shatter instantly because they cannot accurately reflect the Lady Harbinger's maidenly radiance.

11. Lady Sandrone chose the title ""Marionette,"" meaning ""little little Marie"" because she is just so incredibly humble and tries to make herself seem smaller than she is.

12. Eh, Comrades, do y'all remember that Skirmisher who asked Lady Sandrone how old she was? No, you don't? **Exactly—tread lightly, and watch your tongues.**

13. **There are no unethical experiments, projects, or any other workings in the Lady Harbinger's shared Lab with the Doctor. There is nothing to see in there, all is well, all is above board. Do not ask questions about Lab 13, do not pry into the contents of the Forsaken Lab.**

14. Lady Sandrone was walking through the Court of Fontaine one day, and when the children of Fontaine witnessed the elegant maiden walking through the streets, they begged and begged for their toys to be even 1% as majestic as the Lady Harbinger—this is how wind-up toys were invented.

16. Lady Sandrone loves poodles\~! Poodles are the best\~. 

17. For The Marionette's various engineering endeavours, she at once point needed a comically large scale in order to measure materials, so she made one; the people of Fontaine now know this scale as l'Oratrice Mécanique d'Analyse Cardinale.

18. Idrilla the Beauty tried gazing at Lady Sandrone once, but THEY realized that the Lady Harbinger was immeasurably more beautiful than THEM, which is what led to THEIR disappearance from the cosmos.

19. One day, Lady Sandrone noticed a group of young ladies dressed in rags, all depressed and lacking self-worth; feeling bad, she **invented fashion** in order to show those young ladies their true beauty and to restore their self-esteem.

19. Lady Sandrone once came to know of a tea party that had been robbed of its tea, leaving the attendants with nothing but beans and cakes; The Marionnette stepped in, crushed the beans with her bare hands, and **invented coffee**.

20. The reason Phanes is asleep is because the night after they saw Lady Sandrone for the first time, they got trapped in an eternal dream about how beautiful she is.

21. Lady Sandrone knows why the Doctor's answer is 70.

22. *Lady Sandrone is a peerless gem, Lady Sandrone is an inimitable beauty, Lady Sandrone is an unrivaled genius.* This verse of praise for the Lady Harbinger is also something that was appropriated by an eccentric alien, but Lady Sandrone is so humble and merciful that she shares this verse with no ill-will.

23. Lady Sandrone **won** the game.

24. The Marionette took a deep breath once; when she exhaled, the Thousand Winds were born.

26. When Lady Sandrone was born, the nurse cried, overwhelmed by the baby girl's radiance.

27. An Inazuman Guuji once tried writing a light novel about The Marionette, but the paper spontaneously combusted the moment this would-be author tried describing the Lady Harbinger's beauty.

28. Lady Sandrone is so humble that she's requested I stop writing these and return to my post at the Forsaken Lab... we don't deserve her, Comrades.",12,1764910837.0,FatuiHQ,3,1.0,False

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/1ro2GeCQvK): **May 10, 2025**

OOP lives in a semi-rural neighborhood with a hot spring-fed backyard hot tub and a stream running through the area, used by all neighbors for gardens and recreational purposes. OOP's neighbor, referred to as ""CN"" (Crazy Neighbor), is described as litigious and entitled, previously sued former homeowners and later trying to impose bizarre rules on the neighborhood, like claiming everyone should have access to each other's hot springs and that kids can play in private backyard streams. OOP has a neighbor, Jay, who has been on their side from day one.

After moving in, OOP had an unpleasant encounter with CN, who tried to impose these rules on OOP's property. Despite being told no, CN's kids were caught playing in OOP's hot spring, and CN herself later hired workers to pipe hot spring water into her yard without OOP's permission. Once OOP confronted her, CN showed a questionable contract claiming OOP agreed to supply her with water, though OOP had no recollection of signing anything and planned to prove the document was forged. Things escalated when CN began dumping chemicals into the communal stream, poisoning OOP’s garden. OOP is considering legal action and gathering evidence to protect the property. They have also reached out to a lawyer for advice and are trying to figure out the next steps, including using video footage as evidence.

In short: OOP's neighbor is wreaking havoc by stealing water and poisoning the stream, and OOP is looking for legal advice and ways to protect their property.

[Test results](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/qwJA1sdMWb): **May 10, 2025 (four hours later)**

**Update 1:** Jay offered to use a large drum in his garage to temporarily remove the water from the stream and seeing your comments, I’m taking him up on his deal. All the neighbors down the street that I’ve talked to so far (two besides Jay) agreed. One who has two sons said that they might block off the start of the stream. It is a small outlet of a moderately sized creek. It will probably be blocked off not that hard. Jay said that he can probably get the drum in place by tonight as his dad can help. Jay also has a sweet dog and definitely wants to protect it. I am going to remove my plants from the soil nearby the stream. Also, for reference in size of the stream, it’s about 1-2 feet across. Truly just a stream. There’s lots of obstacles and things that would probably filter out, but we definitely still have to be safe. I’ll update later tonight or tomorrow.

**Update 2:** Big news! The nice neighbors’ kids dammed up the stream at where it starts. It’s a couple pieces of wood, a branch or two, and a lot of small rocks. There’s still a tiny bit of water flowing, but it’s absorbed by the soil higher up before CN. Jay got the drum out, but we turned out not to need it. There’s water still in the pools in his backyard and we plan to do a water test. Apparently pH tests are sold in a store just 10 mins away, so I will head there as soon as I finish this post.

**Update 3:** Jays getting the pH test and an oxygen level test, but I don’t know how oxygen levels would play into it. I’ll look at responses and figure out what to do next. I will call authorities soon.

**Update 4:** The water test: pH came lower than the creek water before CN’s house (a full .9 lower). Nitrates a bit higher, Dissolved Oxygen significantly lower. That’s the only real changes in between the two tests. I wonder if she just poured a lot of vinegar. I think herbicides do change pH, but .9 is quite a bit I think.

&nbsp;

[Cops pick up crazy neighbor](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/MJJoQOjH5y): **May 11, 2025 (next day)**

**Update 5:** Big update! The makeshift dam broke and water has been flowing down, but it’s been slow. CN complained to a neighbor up the street that she’s on speaking terms with about me being a major asshole for not letting her kids use my hot spring tub. She let it slip that she poured vinegar in the stream as “justice”. The neighbor was also shown the contract for the pipes and she said that she didn’t even have it signed by me. She and her lawyer had signed it, but without any signature space for me. I thought that she forged my signature, but she didn’t have any agreement (fraudulent or otherwise) on my side whatsoever. The neighbor similarly dislikes her, but their kids are friends, so she has to talk to CN. I sent all the info to a local environmental charity that has contacts within environmental protection agencies. They usually deal with lakes and dumping, so this was in what they deal with regularly.

The police were outside CN’s house a couple hours ago and took her to the station. CN is back at her house, now yelling over the fence profanities while I’m having a coffee. I don’t know if they arrested her and she payed bail or that she just was taken in for questioning or something. I know her brother in law works at the police station, but I wouldn’t doubt that her family members have a strained relationship with her. I hope that she’s stuck with a giant fine and/or jail time. CN’s lawyer still hasn’t served me regarding the pipes, and my lawyer is saying that CN has no case whatsoever. I’ll update as soon as anything interesting comes up.

**Update 6:** My power just went out in most of my house. I think CN just flipped the breakers to annoy me. Going outside ASAP

**Update 7:** CN indeed did flip the breakers. As far as I know, the security camera has an internal battery for some time after it’s disconnected from the power, so I don’t have to worry about her doing anything.

[Revenge Tactics](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/wPsQosUJb0): **May 11, 2025 (one hour later)**

While the government does its thing against my neighbor, I would like to do the most legal annoying thing to do. Currently, I'm thinking about removing the piping and separating the original cost. I think I will send every piece individually through a local copy/print/delivery shop. I know the owner and I think he would think it would be hilarious and agree to it.

The plan (please help with it):

1) Remove the piping from the ground and separate *every* piece into small plastic baggies (and boxes).
2) Bring to copy/print/delivery shop
3) Plan deliveries of each package every period of time over a long time that require signage
4) Wait
5) Tip the copy/print/shop a hundred bucks

What do you think? What else could I do?

&nbsp;

[The beginning of sweet revenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/4S0npgC6zf): **May 11, 2025 (three hours later)**

I called the owner of the copy/print/delivery shop and he agreed to what I said in the previous post. I removed all of the pipes from my yard and put them into bags. I didn’t have as much plastic bags and boxes as I thought so I’m paying extra for the owner of the copy shop to supply them. He just delivered the first one to CN (I watched from the street) and CN’s husband answered. He shouted for CN and she came up. I didn’t hear any of the discussion, but she signed delivery sheet, took the package (of a single small corner pipe piece), and stormed into her house. She went up to the 2nd story window and proceeded to glare at me since, still glaring as I sit on my couch while writing this. Working from home will be so nice for watching this.

&nbsp;

[Crazy Neighbor's weak jabs at me](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/OX0lVXVnCE): **May 11, 2025 (four hours later)**

Since my last post, there has been one more pipe delivery to CN and she is *pissed*. She stormed over to my house (after signing the delivery which I thought she would stop doing) and banged on the door. I started recording my front door and opened the door (I'm not dumb enough to let her in). CN starts shrieking about how I'm awful and that I had to keep the pipes installed as it was *her* property and that *we* had a contract. When I told her that the contract wasn't legal at all, she starts screaming at me. I stepped inside for a second and called the police with the door closed. CN continues banging on my door. I don't open until a police car comes down the street.

I tell the police that I don't want her ever to be on my property and that she is trespassing. They relay that to her, and she takes up a hurt old lady act (for reference, she is in her 40s). CN tells them that my hot tub burned her youngest child and that I was luring kids in. I showed the police the camera footage and they asked her to come to the station with them. I'm assuming that she made some fake report, but I guess that will be another charge of lying to a police officer. I think that the officer (not CN's brother-in-law) believed me and saw that she was in fact a CN.

I saw CN get back into her house and once again went up to the top window, staring. I closed the blinds. I thought she would stop (honestly it doesn't bother me), but to my surprise, she crosses the street to the side of the hill (there’s a slope on the other side of the street from the houses. There's more houses up the slope) and stares through my front window. I don't have blinds for that one and was about to head to a different room when I see her trip backwards (there’s a small ditch for runoff) and land on her butt. CN lets out a ungodly shriek (it wasn't that loud, but I'd like to say it was) as she storms back into her house.

I feel at this point, with all of the stuff from my lawyer, from reddit, and neighbors saying that I am completely in the right and that CN is insane has made this more into entertainment than a scary situation for me. I have multiple locks arriving in a couple days and a new security camera for the side yard. If you have any *legal* suggestions, please tell me. If there's anything I should be aware of, please tell me.

[Pulling back and going forwards legally](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/hZ2daagGbf): **May 12, 2025 (next day)**

I’ve been told that messing with CN is probably not going to help out legally, especially with a restraining order, so I just told the copy shop owner just to deliver it all at once. I don’t know if that’s happened yet, but I’m fine not being looking when I happens. I will file a restraining order today. I don’t know how it works, but I hope I can complete it today. No new news from CN except Jay saying that she looked really mad. I know this isn’t a big update, but it’s an update on the situation.

[Husband comes over to talk](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/IHUDGiHHgw): **May 13, 2025 (next day)**

This happened last night and I was too tired to update after it. CN's husband (I'll call him NH for neighbor husband) knocked on my door last night, alone. CN wasn't there, so I answered it. He then tells me that CN is ""going through some things right now"" and some other stuff. He then asks me if I could ""let sleeping dogs lie. She did some stuff wrong, but she's a really great person"". I told him that I would consider it. I'm not, but I didn't want to be in that conversation. I honestly thought that he would apologize about it, but making excuses like that is so pathetic. According to many of my neighbors, CN's been like this for years. I think he's trying to cover themselves from the bomb they just planted. That's all. New updates probably coming soon.

&nbsp;

[Some resolution (but not in the way you think)](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/mUVeWilBwq): **May 14, 2025 (next day)**

I was typing this out earlier, but it didn’t save as a draft so I will paraphrase it instead of writing it all out like earlier.

I went out to get my mail and I noticed CN rush out of her house onto her porch to watch me. I take the mail and head inside. Through the endless sea of junk mail, there was a wedding invitation. Nobody I know remotely nearby is getting married and I didn’t recognize the names or the faces. On the back was a handwritten letter thanking me for volunteering my house for the bachelorette party and inviting me to wedding at a local venue.

1) Definitely did NOT invite anyone to use my property for a party
2) My backyard isn’t the biggest for a party
3) I don’t know who these people are

I took a picture of the front and the back and then went and made a copy of the invitation and cut it to the right size. I then took the copy and walked in front of CN’s house (in the street). She is looking from the door. I then light the copy on fire (safely). She runs out and starts yelling at me. I am not entirely listening as I had an earbud in my left ear listening to a podcast (I listen to podcasts while doing my routines and hadn’t bothered to take it out) and at one point, I heard the groom’s name. Clearly she was behind it (I knew before, this just solidified the fact). I called her husband and told him that I was not hosting the bachelorette party and to leave me alone. He asks which one. I told him the names of the bride and groom. He is audibly surprised. He then tells me that the groom is CN’s son from a teenage pregnancy (not with him). He then said that he would talk to CN about it, calling it an accident.

I find the name of the dad of the groom and call him. He sounded super genuinely grateful when I told him who I was. I asked him about CN and he said that she had left the baby with him and when he had sued for child support, the judge said that it was his poor choices that led to the baby and he was responsible for it, without child support. I told him the situation, and he sounded defeated. Apparently, the groom had been quick to forgive his absent mother (CN) and had invited her against the dad’s wishes. He said that he would tell the groom and the bride about the situation.

I then had a thought that would be the absolute perfect revenge: I offered to host the party for free with 2 rules

1) They don’t damage anything and clean everything up
2) CN is blocked at the door of the wedding despite her invitation
3) My invite to the wedding still stands.

He said he would discuss it with the bride and groom. Even if he says no, it’s worth a try.

I just realized I typed it all up in detail despite what I said at the beginning. I will probably get the news in the next couple days.

&nbsp;

Groom's dad (GD), Groom, and Bride

I was looking over some comments just before posting this and realized I don't want to be screwed over, so I am staying back. 

Also, GD gave me a call *extremely* late last night and told me that Groom wanted to meet his mom (CN) at the wedding. Bride was supportive, thinking it would be an extremely wholesome wedding. GD said that he would try to find another location for the party, but that it would be hard this late as Bride had a large bridesmaids group. GD is going to help CN with preparing for the wedding at his son's request, even though he thinks it might be a disaster. 

My plants that are near the stream look scorched as if they were in a fire. (I'm talking about the plants that are next and around the stream, not in my garden.

I think the next steps are through legal means and not through petty actions. I will keep you all updated.

[Piecing parts together](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/Kf3YW51zje): **May 15, 2025 (six hours later)**

CN had been trying to gain access to the hot spring for as long as she's known of it. She had tried lawsuits, land disputes, and other legal and legally dubious means to get it. When she heard of her son becoming married, she thought that she could have a good attempt at gaining access to the hot spring.

CN had initially offered to use her house for a price for the bridesmaids party, but since it didn't have anything good for a party, Bride had declined. She couldn't find another place though, but still didn't want CN's house. CN had then had the bright idea to tell the Bride and Groom that she had had a *natural, healing, and amazing* hot spring in her yard and Bride said yes. 

This is when CN tries the whole piping the hot spring to her yard. She obviously doesn't get far into that plan. After I dismantle all the piping, she volunteers my house and backyard for the party.

I think that the stream pollution was lashing out because she was mad before she volunteered my house. No updates besides what I've pieced together from assorted sources.

[Revenge is back in action, without me needing to participate](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/WoyeHkiRct): **May 15, 2025 (seven hours later)**
  
GD called me about 10 mins ago. I was going to post the update right away, but I was reading some of the comments.

This is what he said, and asked if my offer about hosting the bridesmaids party was still standing (this is heavily paraphrased to be readable, but all the main points and events are there).

GD met up with CN to talk to her about the wedding, mostly setting boundaries. He went to her house (with his phone recording just in case anything happened, knowing the history of CN). 

GD is talking to CN very formally, as much straight facts as possible when he glances through a cracked open door into her bedroom. I don't remember the word he used to describe it (it was a very good way to say it), but kind of out of the corner of your vision when you're avoiding eye contact. GD sees multiple white dresses laying on CN's bed. They are fancy dresses. Not quite wedding dresses, but definitely close. GD can't stop staring at it. He then asks CN about what she's wearing to the wedding, and CN says that she has a couple dresses picked out.

He connects the dots and subtly leaves the conversation, calls Bride and Groom and tells them what he saw. He then gives Groom some of CN's history. Bride then asks if they can do the house with the hot spring then.

GD tells me that he knows that I don't like CN and that I wouldn't be at the wedding, but that the rest of the deal would stand. I told him sure, but not to let CN know about it, just letting herself think that I got pushed around by him into hosting.

I know that the agencies I contacted about her pouring vinegar into the creek have been investigating, so even though it likely wouldn't, I hope it all falls out on the day of the wedding

[CN Angry](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/2UBoowojed): **May 17, 2025 (two days later)**

I’ve been asked for an update. There has not been much crazy neighbor activity over the time that I haven’t updated. I think she installed a step stool on her side of the fence as she’s been looking evil eying me whenever I’m in the hot tub. The weddings coming up next weekend, so I’m interested in what’s going to happen. Not much has happened besides that.

[Really funny mini-revenge](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/AY79UY3yJF): **May 20, 2025 (three days later)** 

Ok, I’ve been told to skinny dip in the hot spring. I’m not doing that. I am not socially ok enough for my neighbor to see, even if it’s to get revenge. I do know some people who are.

This happened yesterday around 1, just for reference. I tell some friends who are comfortable in their own bodies that they could hang out in the hot tub and I’m not going to be there, so they could do whatever. I more asked them to do it after I gave a little bit of backstory of the neighbor. They happily agreed and they came around 1. I left for a nice long lunch when they came and I told them to call me if anything happened. I also turned off the back security camera just to not be weird. Not 30 minutes later do the COPS call me asking if I was ok with the people in my backyard. CN had called the cops for a trespassing (hypocrite) and they had arrived and talked to my friends. They had my number and they called me. I told them that I invited them over and the cops left. I didn’t get a call this time, but the police were called again for my friends “exposing themselves to children”. The police knew that they were in a private backyard, but still came and pretty much left almost immediately after (it was the same officers I think). That’s all. I don’t think I’m going to do anything until the wedding. Thank you for the astounding amounts of comments, it’s absolutely insane.

[The Wedding](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/p0pwrZpxfe): **May 25, 2025 (five days later)**

I haven’t updated in a while even though some stuff is happened just so I could save it for this giant update. I am so shocked by what happened and I guess I should have listened to some advice about being safe. Also, I phrased the update about the card wrong as the bridesmaids party was last night and the wedding is today (the ceremony just finished just a couple minutes ago and I got the news of what happened by a mutual friend who went to the wedding (I didn’t know he was a mutual friend or going to the wedding. I told him about the situation a while ago and he decided to let me know).

Friday: CN kept looking over the fence. I would have turned on sprinklers, but I don’t have any because I don’t really have grass in my backyard. Later in the day, a police car pulled into CN’s driveway and a bit after, it left. CN’s “revenge” of staring at me continued a lot more after that. I don’t understand why she wastes her time doing it. It doesn’t make me feel uncomfortable.

Saturday: Some people knocked on my door midday asking if I could let them into the backyard to set up for the bridal party. I called GD and he said it was the right people (just to be safe). They set up some surprisingly expensive and nice decorations and furniture in the yard (not in a destructive way). People come in and out while setting up and the backyard looks amazing. CN continuously peered over the fence for a good amount of time, but I didn’t care. Around 6, Bride and all the bridesmaids (I’ll do M for bridesmaids) (also about 20 bridesmaids there). I stayed inside mostly, but they occasionally asked me to come out and they drunkenly thanked me. I think the Ms were very wealthy as I received a little over 3K in “tips” from them as I occasionally brought out a carton of ice cream. Well worth it I think.

More to the events of the party. CN had a campfire in her backyard around 9, but there wasn’t really any wind, so the smoke just stayed in her yard. I think she tried to smoke us out, but maybe she was just having a little fire (I doubt it though). She then gets her hose to put out the fire and “accidentally” sprays water over the fence. Eventually, once the party winds down and they’re packing up, Bride hands a card signed by all of them thanking me for hosting with additional tips inside (about 2K). I was honestly stunned how nice they were.

Around 11, a very drunk CN bangs on my front door as I’m about to go to sleep. I don’t answer, but have the video on the doorbell camera. She leaves after a bit and I go to bed.

This morning: this is a secondhand account, so I won’t have all the details. CN comes to the wedding in her very white dress and demands to be let in, but the security denies her. She tries to push the security, but he isn’t fazed. People were watching, but my friend who was there had to go do something (I didn’t ask what). When he gets back, CN isn’t there.

What’s happening on my side: this is my account that is right after, but before I got the news about what happened. CN bangs on my door and tries the knob. Since I was getting groceries a bit before, I had accidentally left it unlocked. She comes into my house. I call the cops as soon as I see her open my door. I run upstairs while I give the info to the cops. CN screams at me and eventually slaps me in the face. I’m screaming at her to leave and she tries to slap me again. I grab her wrist and she screams. I basically drag her out the front door right as the police arrive. She is put in the back of the cop car and the police interview me. I tell them and they leave, then I get the news.

CN is not back. I honestly won’t argue with people about if this is true or not as what happened this morning doesn’t feel real even though I just lived through it.

[Final Update: FAFO](https://www.reddit.com/r/EntitledPeople/comments/1l57pxg/final_update_fafo/): **June 6, 2025**

This is probably the final update as I doubt any new updates will come. CN still hasn’t come back from the police station, or she’s been hiding in her house. If she hasn’t come back (which I think), I think she might have not been able to pay bail, but I have no legal knowledge really. She’s apparently facing north of 3 years in jail, but there’s a good chance she’ll get less or not at all. I grilled some food Saturday and hosted a good amount of the neighborhood. As much as I would like to say I was cool and collected after the assault, I felt a bit shaky and not great, so having some people over seemed like a good idea. I think it’s mostly worked. Last night, I went in the hot spring and it was really nice to hang out.

#----NEW UPDATES----

[An update on the creek poisoning crazy neighbor](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/gxTPHYxxcz): **November 24, 2025 (5.5 months later from the previous update)**

An update on the creek poisoning crazy neighbor

I really didn’t think I would do an update as I thought that my CN would finally stop after getting legal punishment. She so far has only with me. 

One of my very nice neighbors who has the kids who volunteered to help stop the creek earlier this year is well liked throughout the neighborhood. I think I’ll call her Donna because I don’t want to put her name here after someone found out what city I live in. So she often helps with babysitting kids for a couple hours for a simple IOU. It’s thanksgiving break for all the kids so lots of people are going on vacation or visiting family. CN and her husband are currently in California. You may think ‘oh where are her kids’. She left all 3 of her kids at the doorstep of Donna with an envelope that has $50 to pay for the 2 weeks that they’re at the beach. The thing is, Donna and her whole family is in the Midwest for the week visiting family for Thanksgiving. 

CN’s kids were out at the door for hours (presumably in the cold rain) before another neighbor noticed them and asked what they were doing. The kids said that Donna had agreed to have them until their parents got back, but obviously Donna wasn’t there. They didn’t want to call the cops as they thought it was a misunderstanding, so they brought the kids around until a newer family agreed to watch them until it was sorted out. CN isn’t responding to any attempts to reach her, and nobody wants to bring the cops into it. Donna’s pissed and said that she won’t come back to babysit them and that there was no deal ahead of time. 

I’m just an observer in this so far, so this is more of a neighbor update. Probably going to have another update or two. Any recommendations? Nobody in the neighborhood wants anyone with the government involved really, and it’s not really involving me, so I doubt my voice will be heard or taken seriously. I don’t know. Thanks

**Update:** Pretty big consensus I should call CPS. I think I will but not tell anyone I did. CN is not a good person. If you want to know what the full situation is, I’d look at the old post. It’s archived so I think you can still see it.

**Update 2:** it wasn’t me, but someone called the cops earlier and by the time I called, they said that someone was at the house already. Currently, they’re trying to contact CN and her husband, but so far no luck. 

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** CPS should be called... idk if you're counting that as ""government"" but CN abandoned her kids for 2 WEEKS! It's child abandonment, plain and simple. She needs to come get her kids and if you guys can't get her to do it, I bet CPS will. They are there for the kids and to ensure their safety.

> **OOP:** I’ve said that but the family that’s having them now think that it’s cruel to the kids and would break up the family. It’s their choice in the end I guess :/

**Commenter 2:** What’s cruel to the kids is thinking you bumpkins know what’s best for them and protecting a deadbeat. Kids need stability. If their parents can’t provide that then you are doing them a massive disservice by not calling cps. No “family” leaves their kids in another state without knowing their wellbeing or making sure they are safe.

> **OOP:** I know. CN is definitely not a good parent but a lot of the people in the neighborhood haven’t like directly seen stuff and I’m not really involved right now so I don’t really have a say. Calling the cops or anyone will just reflect really negatively on me because I think they just think it’s a misunderstanding right now.

**OOP on the said kids' ages**

> **OOP:** I don’t know exactly, but probably 9,10,11? In spring the youngest was 8 and they’re very similar in age so it’s a guess

**Commenter 3:** Did she get any jail time based on the breaking and entering she committed post wedding?

> **OOP:** Not as far as I know. A giant fine and a giant amount of community service I think.

**OOP on if CN got fined for pouring vinegar into the creek water?** 

> **OOP:** She already got fined a giant amount due to my reporting of it to a local environmentalist group and then taking it to the authorities.

&nbsp;

**Editor's note: the next latest update was rehashed in the previous update**

[Not good update on child abandoning neighbor](https://www.reddit.com/r/neighborsfromhell/s/NYnoSUpLHK): **November 28, 2025 (four days later)**

Not good update on child abandoning neighbor

So yesterday, CN actually responded to a call and when asked about everything, she sent screenshots from months ago where Donna said that she could possibly babysit them for the two weeks, but she was still making plans with her family about visiting them. Donna said that it would be $2000 for the two weeks, but she wasn’t sure if she could and that she would let her know if she could do it and not to count on it. CN played it off as a big misunderstanding with Donna as the fault and pretty much everyone believed her. So the kids are staying at the newer family’s house for the remaining time in exchange for $1000 from CN. I’d say $1000 in exchange for not being arrested is a pretty good deal for CN that she does not deserve. 

At least the kids looked super happy spending thanksgiving with the family and were playing with their family in the yard for much of yesterday. 

I guess everyone forgot that the kids brought $50 instead of $2000.

:/

What should I do?

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter:** So is this all done? Timestamps show this discussion took place awhile ago and there was no follow up. Does CN have friends in higher up places or is CPS moving at a holiday pace?

> **OOP:** I think CPS left the situation after CN convinced everyone it was a misunderstanding. It happened yesterday and the day before, but started at the beginning of their thanksgiving break

We talked over break everyday and she would even randomly send cute pictures of what she was doing.  When I had gotten back to campus I had followed up on asking what day she thinks she may be free for coffee.  She ghosted me for 3 days before I sent another saying i would really like to see her in person and she immediately responded saying sorry and she’s been dealing with family issues.  She had told me before that her parents were divorced and other stories involving them so it wasn’t the most unbelievable thing she could’ve said.  Anyways I asked if she was alr and wanted to talk about it but she told me she was ok and appreciated me asking but she thinks she needs time to get back to being herself again.

1pemb06,https://linktr.ee/universityexploitsbyjx,"The 110+ TOEFL Blueprint: Your Protocol for Global Admissions, TA Assistantships & Visa Certainty","# The Premise: A University Simulation, Not Just a Language Test.

Achieving a 110+ score on the TOEFL iBT is not simply about proving you speak English; it is the definitive signal to Admissions Committees and Visa Officers that you are ""Day One Ready."" For international applicants, a sub-100 score is a red flag suggesting you will struggle in a seminar; a 110+ is a validated asset that unlocks Teaching Assistantships (TA/RA), merit scholarships, and instant credibility at Ivy League and Top-tier institutions.

Treating the TOEFL like a casual conversation or relying solely on your consumption of American movies is how fluent speakers end up with a 23 in Speaking and a rejection letter. The winning approach is to treat the TOEFL as a **standardized performance assessment**: deconstruct the ETS scoring rubrics, master the art of ""synthesized note-taking,"" and pressure-test your ability to produce structured academic responses under extreme time constraints.

# At a glance (Core Components):

* **Reading:** Academic prose (Science, History, Art). It tests your ability to map arguments and vocabulary in context, not just skim for keywords.
* **Listening:** The backbone of the exam. You must comprehend lecture structures (Theory vs. Example) and conversational pragmatics (Student vs. Professor dynamics).
* **Speaking:** Four tasks. One independent, three integrated. This is not a chat; it is a timed oral presentation requiring perfect pacing and transition logic.
* **Writing:** The ""Integrated Task"" (Reading/Listening synthesis) and the ""Writing for an Academic Discussion"" (The modern, short-form debate).

**The ""Compiler"" (Note-Taking Strategy):** Your cheat code. If you try to remember everything, you fail. If you write down everything, you miss the logic. Developing a shorthand symbol system (e.g., using arrows for cause-and-effect) is how professionals clear the Integrated sections with high precision.

# The Challenge: Four Score-Killing Traps That Derail Fluent Speakers

**1. The ""Conversationalist"" Fallacy**  
Being able to order coffee or chat in a discord server does not translate to TOEFL success. The Speaking section is scored by the **SpeechRater** algorithm and human raters who look for specific delivery metrics: topic development, fluidity, and vocabulary variety. Using slang, ""umms,"" or circular logic will tank your score, even if your grammar is perfect. You need structured templates, not casual improv.

**2. The ""Transcription"" Trap**  
In the Listening section, amateurs try to transcribe the lecture verbatim. This is impossible. The questions ask about the function of a statement (""Why does the professor mention the bacteria?""), not just the detail. If your head is buried in your scratch paper, you miss the intonation cues that signal the answer. You must map the structure of the lecture, not the script.

**3. The ""Template Zombie"" Syndrome**  
While templates are essential, memorizing rigid, high-vocabulary blocks (""I unequivocally agree with the aforementioned statement due to a plethora of reasons..."") sounds robotic and lowers your score. ETS raters are trained to spot ""canned"" responses. You need a ""Flexible Framework""—a skeleton of logic that you fill with natural, topic-specific content.

**4. The ""New Format"" Blindspot**  
The TOEFL changed recently. The long ""Independent Essay"" is gone, replaced by the ""Writing for an Academic Discussion."" Students using prep materials from 2022 or earlier are practicing for a test that no longer exists. You must simulate the new 10-minute writing pressure test, or you will run out of time.

# The High-Pass Protocol: A System for Peak Exam-Day Performance

# Phase 1 — Diagnostic Baseline & Strategic Planning

**Objective:** Identify whether your issue is Language (vocabulary/grammar) or Strategy (timing/structure).

* **The Baseline:** Take the **TOEFL Go!** free practice test from ETS.
* **The Goal:** 100 is the minimum for most Top 30 Grad Schools; 110+ is the target for Ivy League/Funding eligibility.
* **Analyze the Gap:**
   * Reading/Listening < 25? You have a comprehension/vocabulary deficit.
   * Speaking/Writing < 24? You have a template and delivery deficit.

# Phase 2 — Domain Mastery & Integrated Fluency

Isolate → Master → Build.

* **Vocabulary Engineering:** Do not memorize random lists. Focus on ""Tier 2"" Academic words (e.g., subsequent, facilitate, paradox, accumulate). These appear across all sections.
* **The Speaking ""Flow"" Drill:** Record yourself. If you pause for more than 2 seconds, you lose. Practice ""stalling strategies"" (e.g., ""That’s an interesting perspective to consider..."") to keep the audio stream continuous while your brain catches up.
* **Synthesized Note-Taking:** Practice listening to 2-minute TED Talks. Take notes on the Main Idea, Two Supporting Points, and Conclusion. If you can't reconstruct the talk from your notes, your system is broken.

# Phase 3 — Full-Spectrum Simulation & Stamina

* **The Endurance Factor:** Even though the test is shorter now (<2 hours), the cognitive load is high. You must maintain focus during the Speaking section while other test-takers are shouting around you (if at a center).
* **Background Noise Training:** Practice your Speaking tasks with a TV on or in a coffee shop. You must learn to tunnel-vision your focus.
* **Reviewing Output:** For Writing and Speaking, you cannot self-grade effectively. You need external feedback (Teacher, AI tools, or peer review) to identify grammar fossilization.

# Your Resource Trinity (Quality over Quantity)

**Official Sources (The Canon)**

* **ETS Official Guide to the TOEFL iBT:** The source of truth.
* **TOEFL Go! App:** Official practice sets from the test makers.
* **TPO (TOEFL Practice Online):** These are retired real exams. They are the most accurate predictor of your score.

**Focused Tooling (The Toolkit)**

* **GregMat:** Originally for GRE, his TOEFL logic is unmatched for structure and essay writing. Extremely affordable ($5/mo).
* **TST Prep (YouTube):** Excellent breakdowns of the new ""Academic Discussion"" writing task.
* **MySpeakingScore / ELSA Speak:** AI-driven tools to analyze your pronunciation, pacing, and intonation against native baselines.
* **Otter.ai:** Use this to transcribe your own speaking practice. Reading your own transcripts reveals grammar errors you didn't hear yourself make.

**Targeted Communities (The Forge)**

* **Reddit:** r/Toefl — For recent exam trends and template sharing.
* **TST Prep Discord:** Active community for finding speaking partners.

# 8-Week Accelerator (Global Mobility Roadmap)

Assumes 6-8 hours of study per week.

* **Weeks 1-2 — Input Mastery (Reading/Listening):** Get comfortable with academic texts. Learn to identify ""Signal Words"" (However, Therefore, For example). Master the ""Detail Question"" vs. ""Inference Question"" logic.
* **Weeks 3-5 — Output Structures (Speaking):** Memorize your Flexible Frameworks. Practice Task 1 (Personal Choice) until you can generate 2 reasons for any topic in 15 seconds. Practice Integrated Tasks (2, 3, 4) focusing on summarizing the reading/listening connection.
* **Weeks 6-7 — The New Writing Section:** Master the ""Academic Discussion"" task. You have 10 minutes to read a prompt, read two student opinions, and write your own contribution. Speed typing and quick idea generation are key.
* **Week 8 — The Pressure Test:** Take a full official TPO mock exam. Simulate test conditions (no spell check, noisy environment). Light review of vocabulary.

# Why This System Works

1. **Prioritizes Rubrics over Intuition:** It forces you to speak and write in the exact format ETS graders are trained to reward.
2. **Integrates Skills:** By focusing on note-taking, you simultaneously improve Listening, Speaking, and Integrated Writing.
3. **Insulates Against Anxiety:** Having a template for Speaking removes the ""freeze"" response when the timer starts.

# Quick Start Checklist (Do These Tonight)

1. **Register for the Test:** Dates fill up fast, especially in peak application seasons.
2. **Download the ""TOEFL Go!"" app** and take the free diagnostic for Reading/Listening.
3. **Find a ""Speaking Template""** (TST Prep or GregMat) and print it out.
4. **Listen to one ""60-Second Science"" podcast** and try to summarize it verbally in 45 seconds.

**A:** Check your target universities. US universities generally prefer TOEFL (it’s American academic English), while UK/Australia/Canada lean toward IELTS.

* **Strategy:** TOEFL is 100% computer-based and requires speaking into a microphone. IELTS has a human interviewer. If you get nervous talking to people but are good with tech/mics, pick TOEFL. If you have bad typing speed, IELTS (paper-based option) might be safer.

**Q: Home Edition vs. Test Center?**  
**A:** **Go to the Test Center.** The Home Edition is plagued with horror stories of strict proctors terminating exams due to ""eye movement"" or internet glitches. A Test Center is a controlled environment where technical failures are not your fault.

**Q: What is ""MyBest™ Scores""?**  
**A:** This is ETS's superscoring. It combines your highest section scores from all valid tests in the last 2 years. Warning: Not all universities accept MyBest Scores. Always check the specific department requirements.

**Q: Do I need a native accent?**  
**A:** No. You need **Clarity**. The SpeechRater penalizes choppy rhythm and unintelligible pronunciation, not your native accent. Focus on stress, intonation, and pausing, not on sounding like a California news anchor.

1pemab8,https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAIDev/comments/1pemab8/chatgpt_ads_arent_ads_theyre_the_best_opportunity/,"ChatGPT ""ads"" aren't ads, they're the best opportunity for developers","I saw a lot of people roasting ChatGPT, especially in this thread: [https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1pc351s/comment/ns4oikc/?context=1](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI/comments/1pc351s/comment/ns4oikc/?context=1)

Here is my hot take: calling them ""ads"" is totally wrong. This enables amazing capabilities, but the model is still bad at figuring out when to use the right app. If I ask for grocery shopping, it should use Instacart. If I ask for gift shopping, it should use Target. Right now, it messes up that suggestion step a lot, and that is what makes people mad.

But when it works, it is insane. I made a video showing a scenario where I used ChatGPT to plan a dinner and order all the groceries, all inside the chat. I already had the Instacart app installed, so it did not prompt me to install anything. I just hit checkout. It skips all the copy and pasting. You go from having an idea to completing the real-world task in one chat window. It is actually magic. ChatGPT can actually bring you coffee now (if you're willing to pay for the service lol)

This is also a massive opportunity for business owners, way bigger than Google. You are connected to a high-intent user instantly, and OpenAI is not charging you now. That is pure gold.

What are your thoughts on this? Has anyone else had a good experience using the apps when they are correctly surfaced?

They’re subtle, silent, and often impossible to decode. They don’t flirt like extroverts. They won’t slide into your DMs with 47 heart emojis or post “I like you” TikToks. And if you try to follow the usual dating advice online, you’ll end up confused AF.

I’ve read way too much on this from psychology papers, social neuroscience books, and communication podcasts, and I’ve come to one conclusion: most of the viral dating advice on social media doesn’t apply to introverts at all. Especially not to the type who overthink social interactions and would rather die than double-text.

Here’s your no-fluff, research-backed cheat sheet to spotting when an introvert is lowkey into you.

---

### 1. They remember weirdly specific details about you

Most people forget casual mentions. Not introverts. If they remember what book you said you were reading last week, your coffee order, your favorite childhood cartoon, or that you casually said you hate cilantro once in 2021? That’s their version of “I like you.”

According to Dr. Laurie Helgoe, author of Introvert Power, introverts tend to process interactions deeply. They replay conversations in their minds. And when they like someone, even your most random comment sticks.

---

### 2. They find excuses to be around you (even if it drains them)

Introverts value alone time more than anything. So if they keep showing up where you are, even when they don’t have to? That’s a big deal. They’re spending precious energy to be in your orbit.

You might think: “But they barely talk when they’re around me.” Doesn’t matter. Presence is their way of saying “I care.”  

Susan Cain, in her groundbreaking book Quiet, explains how introverts naturally guard their time and energy. Sharing those resources with you is a loud signal in their quiet language.

---

### 3. You notice long pauses before they respond

It isn’t because they’re awkward, it’s because they’re filtering their words carefully. Introverts tend to self-monitor more, especially around someone they’re interested in. They want to say the right thing. They don’t just speak to fill silence.

Dr. Marti Olsen Laney, a psychotherapist and author of The Introvert Advantage, says introverts process stimuli more slowly and deeply. Which means if they pause before answering you? They care. A LOT.

---

### 4. They open up about their inner world (rare AF)

Introverts won’t tell just anyone how they’re doing, what they’re thinking, or what stresses them out. They might be friendly to many people, but vulnerable with only a few. If they’re sharing their inner thoughts with you like their dreams, fears, even weird childhood stories? You’re in.

This relates to a 2020 study from the Journal of Social and Personal Relationships which showed that introverts tend to form fewer but deeper emotional bonds. If they’re letting you in, it’s intentional.

---

### 5. They imitate your body language without realizing it

Mirroring is one of the most reliable nonverbal cues of attraction. But with introverts, it’s more subconscious. If you cross your legs and a few minutes later they do too? Or you rest your hand on your chin and they mirror that? Their body is speaking what their lips won’t.

Psychologist Dr. Albert Mehrabian's classic communication research backs this up: 55% of communication is nonverbal. And introverts, who say less, often “speak” through tone, posture, and micro-gestures.

---

### 6. They send thoughtful texts (but never fast replies)

Don’t assume they’re not interested just because they reply slow. Introverts can take hours to respond, not because they’re ignoring you, but because they want every reply to be meaningful. They hate small talk. They’d rather send one long message than 10 half-hearted ones.

Watch for how intentional their messages are. If they reference a conversation from earlier or send you something that reminded them of you? They’re into you.

---

### 7. They initiate small moments of physical contact

Introverts usually prefer their personal space. But when they like someone, they’ll lean just a bit closer, brush their hand near yours, or lightly tap your shoulder during a joke. It’s barely noticeable. But it’s them stepping out of their comfort zone just for you.

This echoes findings from social psychologist Dr. Kory Floyd, who studies affection and attraction. Physical touch, even in small amounts, becomes powerful when it's out of character.

---

### 8. They give you their full attention

Introverts aren’t multitaskers in conversations. If they’re with you, they’re fully present, no phone, no distractions. They maintain long eye contact and actually listen. You’ll feel seen. That’s rare.

Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s flow theory suggests that deep focus = deep connection. If an introvert enters a flow state during your convo? That’s intimacy in its rawest form.

---

### 9. They act way more nervous around you than other people

If your normally calm introvert seems fidgety around you? That’s attraction. They might stumble over words, avoid eye contact, blush more. Their anxiety skyrockets not because they don’t like you but because they do.

A 2016 study from Biological Psychology found that infatuation triggers physical anxiety responses, especially in people prone to overprocessing (aka introverts). So if they’re jumpy around just you? Red flag in the best way.

---

### 10. They share niche obsessions with you

Introverts can go deep into hobbies or interests. If they start sending you niche memes about their favorite show, tell you about some obscure sci-fi book they love, or explain how they hand-coded a personal blog? They trust you. That’s a heart-on-sleeve moment for them.

This is known as “intimacy through shared enthusiasm,” a trait often seen in digital-era courtship, as noted in Dr. Helen Fisher’s research on modern relationships for Match.com. It’s less about flirting, more about bonding through shared obsession.

---

### Bonus tip: Best ways to tell if they REALLY like you

Wanna double-confirm it? Use these subtle but effective apps, books, and tools to decode signals better:

- Finch: A self-care pet app that helps introverts express emotions indirectly by caring for a virtual creature. Honestly sweet and weirdly helpful.

- Ash: For relationship coaching, Ash gives daily prompts and gentle nudges to improve emotional literacy and understand your attachment style. Great for analyzing lowkey crush behavior.

- BeFreed: A personalized audio learning app built by AI experts from Google and Columbia grads. It recently went viral on X for a reason. You can type in any topic like “how to understand introvert behavior in dating” and it pulls from expert research, books, and real-world insights to create podcast-style lessons tailored to your interests and depth. I use it during walks or cleaning sessions and even pause mid-lesson to ask follow-up questions. The deep dive mode is insanely good. Replaced my doomscrolling habit and my brain feels way less foggy.

- Book rec: “Attached” by Amir Levine and Rachel Heller. Absolute MUST-READ. NYT bestseller, beloved by therapists and TikTokers alike. Breaks down avoidant and anxious personalities. You’ll finally understand why introverts act hot and cold.

- Podcast: “The Love, Happiness and Success Podcast” by Dr. Lisa Marie Bobby. Amazing episodes on communication between introverts and extroverts. Deep yet practical.

- YouTube: Frank James, a classic. His INFJ and INTP sketches are hilarious but also brutally accurate. You’ll learn more about introvert psychology in one binge than you would in a semester.

- Book rec: “Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can’t Stop Talking” by Susan Cain. Bestseller. Multi-award-winning. This book will make you rethink your whole idea of charisma and attraction. Best book I’ve ever read about how introverts express care. Insanely good read.

Salary as an enlisted personnel is average, but I wanted more.  The responsibility Im having now includes the security of this nation’s leader and facilitating his daily needs is just like our morning coffee. I’ll be entitled for retirement pay and pension if i continue this path for 8 more years but pension alone cant help me live a comfortable life. More pensioners still find themselves being employed instead of being fully retired. And still become broke. I feel “LUGI AKO” for the pay Im having since we work more than 8 hours a day on call 24/7 even after the shift. A day will not end without having compliances for the next day or the next week. The pressure build up and stress made contributions to my weak personal decision making. Yes I signed up for this, but Im thinking that I want to spend more time with my family that i’ll be having and this job won’t allow it. One option I found is to work aboard a cruise ship as a security officer but it’s only 6 months per contract and being aboard again will take time since you will line up. 

Maybe you can share some ideas of other field of work that I can apply my skills that has better pay or maybe there are former military pips here that shifted their career and is now successful financially. 

Here are some notable trainings I finished during my military service

- Combat Medic
- Basic Life Support
- Pistol Course
- Tactical and Defensive Driving
- Small Units Tactics Training
- Close Quarter Combat

I guess to begin with, l'd love to meet you and cuddle. BUT we both are random people on the internet. So let's take our time to get to know one another. Im not saying that we need to wait months on end but like a week or so. Or until you are comfortable with meeting.

With meeting said, I'm pretty much fine with doing mostly whatever you would want to do. I'm not really picky on most things just a few (I make a list). But I would like to meet in a public place first since of course we are strangers, something like getting a bite to eat or getting a drink (boba or coffee or whatever) first would be nice. But I guess I should say a bit more on what l like and don't.

There's a long list of things I like to do but I don't feel like writing a biography. So here's a handful of things I like to do, I like going to museums and looking at the art (obviously) and imagine what the painter was thinking along with what the painting means to me or you, seeing movies in the theatre's (or relaxing at home with a nice blanket and watching them), window shopping and looking at all the things that I can't afford or just shouldn't buy, trying new foods (not much I haven't tried already but there's some), listening to music 24/7, going to concerts, and lastly getting boba or tropical smoothie. There is probably more to that list but I just can't think of everything.

Then today I get a call from the recruiter and they say they have this “new approach” to hiring where they call all your references first and only if those check out they’ll start the actual interview process.

Who actually does that? Like seriously. They’re calling references before even speaking to the candidate. Before even making sure the job is a good fit. Before I get a chance to ask questions or even confirm basic details.And what really pisses me off is that you don’t get to use your references more.

1pelqxv,https://i.redd.it/5jyy5j3bbb5g1.jpeg,Sending some love to a small record store worth checking out while in Melbourne for Justice,"Alley Tunes has been helping me with my record digging fix for over a decade, and they have always been the no.1 spot in Melbourne to find French house singles.

The coffee is always good, the speakers are nicely tuned and the music always has a groove. 

Pictured is just some of the Justice related stuff I've found there over the years, and the poster they gave me after the 2012 show.

I am not affiliated with them in any way, but just wanted to share some love to a spot that has been keeping music alive, and give them a shout out to some people who might like to go and have a dig through their house and french sections, while in town.

(I was there just under a week ago and they had a Simian X Justice 12 inch, a couple of Mr Ozio's, one with a Justice mix, and a bunch of other French and Daft Punk singles. )",15,1764908811.0,JusticeMusic,1,1.0,False

Also, I'm not in love with my comps, so if this sparks anything, I'd love to hear so I can give it a read.* 

  
\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I’m seeking representation for my upmarket novel, THE MIDDLE PART, complete at 87,000 words. Told from the points of view of a cast of characters connected to one family over a week in June 2015, the novel could be compared to *Blue Sisters* by Coco Mellors for exploring complicated sibling relationships in the wake of grief, and *Martyr!* by Kaveh Akbar for themes of family baggage, queerness, and immigration. 

Celebrated food journalist Helen Dimas’s memoir is due in a week. Except she can’t finish the chapters about her childhood. Those years are nothing like the lighthearted scenes from *My Big Fat Greek Wedding* her publisher imagines, and even thinking about them makes her feel like the angry teenager who disappointed her family and the guilty adult who never reconciled with her parents before they died. But, she’s heading to stay with her teenage niece, while her older sister, Diane, takes an inspiration trip to Copenhagen for her coffee shop. Helen agreed partly to strengthen their fragilely rebuilt relationship, and partly because the coffee shop is in the same building as their late father’s restaurant, and could serve as the push she needs to finish writing.

Except Diane’s not going to Copenhagen. She’s following instructions left only to her in their mom’s will: Invite Helen to stay and don’t tell her you’re visiting my sister in Greece. Torn between honoring her mom, who helped her start her business, and risking alienating Helen again, Diane delayed the decision for two years before finally booking the trip, deciding Helen could be hurt either way if she discovers their mom excluded her yet again.

In Greece, the Dimas sisters’ aunt reveals a different version of their parents’ immigration story to Diane, a plan born of necessity instead of romance, which never included opening a restaurant. Meanwhile, Helen avoids writing and spends the week with her niece, the coffee shop’s employees, and a customer, each of whom holds a missing piece to the story Diane’s hearing. When the sisters reunite, each carrying halves of the truth, they’ll have to put them together to form a complete picture of their childhoods. That is, if Helen will even talk to Diane again when she learns she lied. If past wounds reopen, their family story will remain incomplete, and Helen could write a memoir so scathing, it damages the Dimas sisters’ relationship irreparably. ",2,1764908602.0,PubTips,0,1.0,False
