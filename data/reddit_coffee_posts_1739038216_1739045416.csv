   I have been with my Husband for 7 years and love him dearly. We have been in a financial strain this past year with getting married and him having medical issues and having to miss work. I’m also wanting to go back to school for my masters so I can advance my position at my job. I’ve brought up to him about being a platonic companion to an older gentleman or other SD. He is not very sold on the idea of me going out for coffee or having conversations in a friendly way. I’ve told several times I know there are relationships with no sex or feelings involved. I am the bread winner in our relationship and have a higher education and I think it hurts his pride that I would go out and seek a SD. However having conversations with someone who is educated and well versed would be nice. For other married women what has been your experience as a SB and what boundaries did you put up?

Malaysia’s comedians say the nation is galloping into a cancel-culture that will soon push satire and social commentary off the stage – and the political classes share the blame.

In the latest eruption of outcry, it was the turn of stand-up comedy pioneer Harith Iskander to face the whiplash of Malaysia’s increasingly censorious social media.

Harith, a 58-year-old Muslim from southern Johor state who is considered the “godfather” of Malaysian stand-up comedy, was hauled up by police and religious authorities for questioning last month after making a joke about ham on Facebook.

In a January 18 post, he jokingly suggested that the word “ham” in the name of an iced coffee drink – ham sap kopi – could “lead me down the wrong path in so many ways”.

1ikw5jh,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1ikw5jh/cruel_friday/,Cruel Friday,"One of my embarrassments about my LE is that I just shared with her a few evenings and it was more than enough to get me totally hooked. I don’t know what happened, my brain tends to fall in love very slowly, but no with her. Anyways, she didn’t feel the same, so after living the worst two months of my life, I went NC a year ago. 

She has no socials, so I really don't know what is happening in her life. It was really hard, but things gradually improved. I have four photographs of her, but they bore me now and I go weeks without watching them. I was thinking of finally deleting them. I could say I’m happy again now, but this crazy thirst for her never stopped. As most of you know very well, there is something powerful and ethereal in this attraction.

In one of those shared evenings, I mentioned a subject and she showed a keen interest, asking me some questions about it. I have the impression that she thought I liked to talk about that matter in particular.

This week has been a busy one at work. I need to deliver some requirements asap, I have my manager breathing over my neck, so I set my alarm to 5:40AM. Ten minutes after I woke up, I opened reddit on my phone (I don’t know why, usually I visit reddit on my desktop after lunch) and the first thing I saw was the same question my LO asked me several times, and it was on the same subbreddit where we met. (Both of us deleted our accounts after we went NC, but I knew it was not her main account). I browsed the profile that asked the question and… it was her! Her ten years old account. (There is a chance the question was a bait, but I don’t even want to go there). 

I read it for seven hours straight, while holding my mug of coffee. And as the hours passed, I could feel her presence more and more after reading every comment. I realized that I have actually been forgetting her, forgetting her deliciously dorky personality. But suddenly, while reading through her comments, I recovered that feeling of euphoria, admiration and pure love that I felt while we talked and laughed for many hours a year ago. I can even imagine how she tilts her head, and how she was doing those elegant and funny gestures with her hands, the movements that I love. Since when the hands of a woman can be so hypnotic?

I’m devastated though, after reading her jokes, advice and struggles for the last ten years. And yes, the things that I suspected regarding her, are there. She is adorable, but kinda dull, and the fact that all her boyfriends dumped her, it’s a massive red flag. But she is so kind! There is a spirit of goodwill, sincerity and joy leaking through each one of her comments. How could I not love her? I want to cry. I don’t want to play this game anymore. I’d have preferred to never have found her account. I want her damit!

I opened a throwaway account and I wrote a message, responding to her question on the subreddit. It’s one of our inner jokes, so, she knows it's me. A day has passed, last night I couldn’t sleep, but I’m too cowardly to see if she already wrote an answer. I’m terrified to read “I also miss my friend” or some stupid shit like it. I couldn't handle it, not now, not after the last twenty four hours. Maybe at some point next week. I’m not your friend! I will never be your friend.

Needless to say, I didn't spend a single minute on my work. But I couldn’t care less, I want to live now. I just bought a ticket to Sao Paulo, where a friend just rented an apartment. I need to escape from all this, again.

1ikw43x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cna/comments/1ikw43x/day_3_and_i_like_it/,Day 3 and I like it,"So this is my update! I just woke up from my sleep and I finished day 3 and my orientation. I’m on the floor myself Sunday! But I asked my trainer to let me do more and let me chart. I still will need helping with that part but I was told I should get it. I was t ask nervous and I was more vocal and talking to residents and some liked me 🥰 but I was sad because I had a lady who was admitted in later in the day way before I got in and she was kind of on the ““ neglected hall” and I felt bad because she only speak Spanish so by the time I got to her, it was like 3 o’clock in the morning she was full of pee, like up her back and like she was in distress, and she started crying when I was changing her because I had to change all of her bedding and stuff like that and I just felt so bad because she was trying to explain to me in Spanish and they didn’t have anything on her like they didn’t give her like nogood pr know anything so like I gave her all that I can I give her coffee. I gave her graham crackers. I gave her yogurt to find out because I don’t speak Spanish. Yes, she’s diabetic and I just raised her blood sugar so but they also believe that is because she hasn’t eaten like she’s only been given I guess cause I gave her sweet stuff but that’s all that I had so I really really did try my best. I didn’t get in trouble with my nurses because I made her sugar go up but yeah it wasn’t as bad of a night. It was kind of rough. I didn’t finish my rounds until like 330 Ish I didn’t go on break but I did do charting and basically I was told that if don’t really stress myself out, do what I can and like as long as I try to finish the majority the a.m. CNA’s 6-2’s take over they were really sympathetic with me like I told him like I only was able to do one around like I’m really sorry like I was really really sorry and I just felt like really bad. I really did feel bad that like I was so slow, but granted I have to get myself some sort of grace because I did do majority of the work by myself. I was on a floor with. I’m gonna say heavy hitters and heavy wetters so I did have to change a lot of bedding. Overall, I think I enjoy it is that weird? Is that bad and I don’t even find like the fact that yes I do clean up a lot of poop but I honestly don’t find that horrible. I think when you start texting lines and hey I wanna make sure that you’re clean that they just like find a little piece of dignity like I’m making sure like if I fully explain some ha I’m making sure that you are clean like they relax like they don’t wanna fight or anything.

I was interested in it as rarely guys want to just grab a coffee at 12pm! I am usually asked out on dinner, bars or even people wanting to come to my house, so I was intrigued this guy is decent enough to call me for a coffee near his house!

I had no expectations going to it, and was only looking forward to chatting with him and sharing experiences.

I meet him, we definitely vibe and discuss our hobbies etc! After finishing coffee, he invites me for a walk to the neighborhood! I have never been much in that neighborhood so again I was impressed this decent man just wants to show me around the quaint area!

We end up going to a park, not many people around but still some people jogging and walking their dogs. We hike to a point near the highway, and he just starts taking about how nice it is to sometimes just do it out in the open. I humour him a bit about it, not really thinking where it’s going. And all of a sudden he just grabs my junk and tells me how hard he is. At that time, I realized he brought me to his “spot” where he must give men BJs at after his coffee date! 

It was still too out in the open and incoming traffic can ofc see two men getting at it. I understood his urge and offered him going back to my place, which is way too far or his place if he is comfortable! But then he says u know let’s walk a bit more and our conversations became light again.

I am not gonna lie, I did become slightly horny and have never ever in my life did it out in the open at all. Like I have only read cruising in the park stories or caught some porn maybe? Anyways, we end up in a more remote area with some homeless camps nearby. But it was private enough for me to oblige his kink.

He gave me a nice, sloppy BJ and he was so worried someone would see us, maybe that was part of his thrill?

We finished our business and the guy came prepared with the whole mouth washes and stuff! Like he planned this whole outing out beforehand. It was definitely hot I am not gonna lie! We went back to the roads and I called myself uber back home and parted on a good, funny note! 

And now, after sitting in the Uber, I realized how weird this whole experience was. I am not self hating, but it definitely made me hate myself in that moment with my dick soaking wet from a strangers saliva. I don’t know why I let this thing happen, it was a mix of trying something new and not disappointing this person I just had really nice conversations with at the coffee shop.

I feel so confused now. How did this cute coffee date turned into a light cruising in the daylight. Not sure if this will be a memory I will cherish or hate now, if I ever go back to that moderately famous park again!

As someone who takes their coffee seriously, I wanted an effective grinder that could handle fresh beans daily, and this model delivers—but with a few caveats worth mentioning.

Starting with its **design and build quality**, the grinder is compact and lightweight, making it a perfect fit for limited counter space. Its black finish is sleek, and despite its plastic construction, it feels sturdy enough for everyday use. However, the lack of detachable parts makes cleaning a bit tricky. I’ve resorted to using a small brush to clear out leftover grounds, which isn’t particularly inconvenient but certainly not ideal for those who prefer a more thorough cleaning process.

[Check Mr. Coffee IDS57-RB Electric Grinder price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/mr-coffee-ids57-rb-grinder-review-b00005otxm/)

In terms of **grinding performance**, the Mr. Coffee grinder offers a solid range of grind sizes, from coarse for French press to fine for espresso. While the blade mechanism is not as precise as burr grinders, it does a fair job for drip coffee and pour-over methods. I use it to grind beans for my French press, and the consistency has been impressive for its price range. However, achieving a super-fine espresso grind can be a bit challenging, as the blades don’t always deliver the uniformity required for high-end espresso machines.

The **grinding mechanism** relies on sharp stainless steel blades. While this design is efficient for quick grinding, it lacks the precision of burr grinders, which are better for preserving the flavor of premium coffee beans. Still, for casual brewing, such as a standard drip coffee maker or a French press, the performance is more than sufficient. I also tried grinding spices, and while it managed to break them down, the results weren’t as fine or consistent as I’d hoped.

Using this grinder is straightforward. The **ease of use** is one of its best features. It has a simple on/off switch that activates the blades, and the transparent lid allows you to monitor the grind size. There’s no guesswork involved, and the operation is intuitive even for first-time users like my younger cousin, who tried it out and was grinding beans like a pro in no time. However, the lack of preset grind settings might be a downside for those who like precise customization.

Regarding **capacity and speed**, the grinder can handle up to 12 cups’ worth of coffee beans, which is perfect for personal use or small family gatherings. It grinds quickly, taking just seconds to produce a batch of grounds, but the noise level is noticeable. If you’re an early riser like me, you might want to grind your beans while the household is awake to avoid startling anyone.

**Pros**

* Compact design and lightweight build make it easy to store and move.
* Affordable and budget-friendly, offering good performance for casual coffee drinkers.
* Simple operation with a transparent lid for monitoring grind size.
* Decent range of grind sizes suitable for various brewing methods.
* Quick grinding speed, perfect for those in a rush.

**Cons**

* Not as precise as burr grinders, especially for espresso-level fineness.
* Cleaning can be cumbersome due to non-detachable parts.
* Loud operation could be disruptive in quiet settings.
* Struggles with achieving consistent results for non-coffee items like spices.

In comparing the Mr. Coffee IDS57-RB to **competitors**, such as the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind or even entry-level burr grinders, it holds its own in terms of affordability and simplicity. While the Hamilton Beach model offers quieter operation, it lacks the same grinding power and struggles with consistency. On the other hand, burr grinders like the Baratza Encore are miles ahead in precision but come with a significantly higher price tag. For a budget blade grinder, the Mr. Coffee strikes a good balance between cost and functionality.

When it comes to **cost analysis and value for money**, this grinder is a solid investment for casual coffee drinkers. It’s not aimed at coffee aficionados who demand the utmost precision, but for someone looking for a quick, convenient, and affordable way to grind their beans fresh each morning, it’s hard to beat. While it may not have all the bells and whistles of higher-end models, it delivers reliable performance at a fraction of the cost.

Features-wise, this grinder offers versatility. The ability to grind for various brewing methods is a standout, even if it means having to manually monitor the grind size. The safety on/off switch provides peace of mind, especially if you have kids around. The 36-inch cord length is sufficient for most kitchen setups, though I do wish it had a retractable feature for tidier storage. Despite some shortcomings, it’s a practical tool for everyday use.

1ikvxem,https://i.redd.it/s3w6h44ezyhe1.jpeg,Why do I attract people who seem normal at first but end up being crazy and obsessive (currently have 2 stalkers),"I give these people a chance but then they ruin it. Once they realize I have cut them off for good they threaten me / stalk me. Currently I have a guy calling me everyday on no caller id. 
Romantically this has happened 2 times but there is a time years and years ago where I made a friend with this girl and she hates me as well. I met her when I was about 14 (I’m 24f). Around this time I had just started making friends. I had always gotten bullied before then. Long story short she faked her suicide blamed it on me ( I never did anything wrong to her) years later when I’m 18 she contacts me telling me she will kill me one day? And tells me I bullied her when I never did? To this day she still gets people to contact me telling me I got someone to kill themselves.. Now that I’m typing this I realize my ex that has stalked me for months also says that I hurt him too and blames everything on me even when he was the one that was abusive and cheated on me?? 
I swear each one of these people I never treated wrong all I ever did wrong is defend myself then leave… anything stand out in my chart?

1ikvvnd,https://www.reddit.com/r/GermanRoaches/comments/1ikvvnd/roach_in_my_fridge/,Roach in my fridge…,"I live in a small apartment in a massive complex that’s kind of dorm-style. There’s even a door between my unit and another unit. Nothing is very well sealed. I have never had a problem with roaches before & I have been living here for about a year. Had some fruit flies here and there but it happens. Pest control came in and gelled under my kitchen sink a few months ago & I was confused as to even why they were doing it lol. Looking back I partially believe the reason why I have never had a roach issue is because I use so much eucalyptus & lavender scented cleaners, trash bags, etc. But I hadn’t for awhile and that’s when I started seein em’. 

I usually keep very clean but I have been behind lately as I am a STEM girl with crippling ADHD & just haven’t been on top of vacuuming & such. Nothing extreme like food being left out but college student dirty- pile of clothes on couch, homework clutter, broken down boxes, etc.

I also unfortunately realized my “clean” is also cockroach heaven. I keep isopods and keep my room warm for them (around 68-72), I have a ton of houseplants and keep it humid for them… I have a cat & leave for 2 days a week so there is always her water fountain and dry food out. Her litter is wood pellets so the powder sometimes gets onto the floor while i’m gone. I am clean but I am also ADHD lazy as well as an OCD hoarder so I don’t bother cleaning non-food trash sometimes & will keep papers and stuff I don’t need. Like I had my bed “bedblocked” with cardboard boxes because my foster cat needed to socialize and I never cleaned up a few of the pieces. I just threw them out the other day.

So anyways… the past few weeks I had been spotting small german nymphs every now and then in my bathroom when I turned the lights on Maybe 1-2 every 2-3 days. Deep down I knew they were roaches but I wasn’t sure so I just kept flushin em’ when I saw them. I also was kind of praying they were wandering in.

The sightings have started to get a bit worse- I found a nymph drowned in a coffee cup, one every now and then on my wall or in my very small kitchen… but I still was only seeing small ones every few days, and only one or two at worst.

Then it happened… I opened my (mini) fridge to my first big german roach. It freaked me out so bad. I chased it but it got under something and then scuttled under the door into the next unit. AH! It was touching my FOOD! and it ESCAPED!

Fortunately that triggered me enough to deep clean pretty much my whole room. I sprayed everything down with cleaner, vacuumed, deep cleaned the litter box, everything in the bathroom, etc. I need to tackle under my bed next since it’s so cluttered. 

During the cleaning I spotted two very small german nymphs, smaller than the ones I’d been seeing, and in two total different spots of the apartment (albeit it is very small.) I killed them both. 

Didn’t spot any for a few days after that, then while cleaning my cat’s water fountain yesterday I found another super tiny nymph drowning itself in it. I sprayed everything down with lemongrass scented cleaner (to see if my scent theory has any grounds) and put down advion gel bait in a few areas to test the population. I got alpine WSG but still am waiting on my spray bottles to come in, and I am also a bit worried about spraying in areas near my isopods & cat. 

So anyways, that begs the question… do I have a breeding population, or do you think they are mostly nymphs wandering in? Am I the problem?! Am I screwed? If I have a breeding pop, where should I be looking for them? I’m going to see if I can get behind my fridge & going to check under my bed next. So scared. ",1,1739044119.0,GermanRoaches,1,1.0,False

She asked about hotels in my area, so I just offered to let her stay at my place for the week. I'm wondering if she is being a little rude or if I'm just personally uncomfortable with hosting people I don't know that well. When it's family or close friends visiting to see me, I take time off work and pull out all the stops with hosting.  
  
The day of her arrival, I invited her to join us for dinner. I assumed that she would likely have dinner plans with others during the conference. Now it turns out she is coming home for dinner every night. We don't usually cook a full meal every night -- half the time it's leftovers and sometimes it's just ""fend for yourself"" with a can of soup and a makeshift salad. But with her here, I've made several full meals. I feel pressure now to plan multiple dinners and not sure if it's better to just suck it up and do it (I don't want to be rude and make her feel unwelcome). But I also don't like to be treated rudely.... What would you do in this situation?

I usually like to have an easy dinner with my partner and then we go our separate ways to decompress. But the coworker wants to hang out and chat for several hours....How do I politely disengage?

I usually don't eat breakfast....I left her fruit, eggs to cook herself, and coffee in the guest studio, but the other night she said, ""I would love some breakfast food if you have it."" Is it the right thing to wake up early than usual and provide her breakfast? I assumed since she had a car and a conference agenda that she would figure out a lot of this on her own. 

I am having trouble reconciling not wanting to be a rude host but also not wanting to have her stay disrupt my life since I'm working all week. I have a certain routine to feel at my best (my sleep hours, diet, etc.) and I'm starting to feel burdened.....I wish I could casually and breezily host a coworker.

1ikvs6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1ikvs6u/my_mom_hates_my_boyfriend/,My mom hates my boyfriend,"Moving in with my boyfriend was simultaneously the hardest and yet the best decision I have ever made. I’ll admit, I had *some* doubts myself on whether it was “too soon”. After all, we had only been together for a few weeks at that point. But like Kyle always said, “Quality over Quantity”. Still, I had lingering doubts. What if we broke up? What if we lived together and ended up hating each other?

But the first month or so with Kyle had been such a breeze. He was such a gentleman. He woke me up every morning with pancakes and coffee. If I did the dishes, he did the laundry. When I had nightmares, he made sure to cuddle me in his large arms and put me back to sleep. He literally could not be more perfect. 

My mom, however, did not share my view. She was vehemently opposed to our relationship from day 1. In her words ""A mom always knows what is best for her daughter"" which really was just code for ""I enjoy micromanaging every aspect of your life because I am unhappy with my own""

I found her crying in her bedroom the night I and Kyle broke the news. Kyle said she was overreacting. “She always has to make everything about herself, don’t worry,” he said. 

When I told Mom that I and Kyle were planning to move in together, she went ballistic. She called her sister, who of course came over to stick her overly large nose into our business. A shouting match between the four of us ensued with the entire neighborhood getting front-row seats. Eventually, Kyle and I just walked out of the house, ignoring her repeated pleas and cries. “You can never win an argument with a stupid person” Kyle would tell me later. 

One day, Kyle and I got a message from her sister. 

*Maria committed suicide last night. The two of you will rot in hell.*

At first tears swelled in my eyes but they were quickly replaced by a seething rage. The audacity of this bitch. I chanced a glance at Kyle and he looked furious too.

“Kyle, I don’t know what to say… This.. This”

I had begun to sway, my head was spinning. He came out of his reverie and caught me in his hands.

“Hey, hey easy there girl” 

“The bitch”

“I know”

“The fucking bitch” 

“I know”

“How… how…. Dare she. She and her sister, do they realize the fucking trauma they inflicted on me for a decision that concerns MY LIFE?”

I sobbed into his shoulder. He wrapped his arms around me. I felt a little more steady.

“Fuck her. The bitch will soon go the way of her sister. Don’t worry about this babe. Do you understand me?”

I looked up at him, his large, round amber eyes were looking at me with concern.

1ikvs23,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1ikvs23/my_husbands_trump_obsession_has_turned_our_home/,My husband's Trump obsession has turned our home into a MAGA shrine and I'm losing my mind,"I never thought I'd be posting here, but I desperately need to vent. My husband of 12 years has transformed from a reasonable conservative into what I can only describe as a Trump cult member, and it's destroying our marriage.

Our house has become a literal shrine to Trump. I wish I was exaggerating. There's a 6-foot Trump cardboard cutout in our living room that he talks to every morning like some sort of religious ritual. Our walls, once decorated with family photos, are now plastered with Trump flags. He even replaced our American flag with a ""Trump 2024 or Death"" banner. My kids are embarrassed to have friends over.

Last week was the final straw. He spent $3,000 of our savings on ""limited edition"" Trump gold-plated coins and a ""certified authentic"" piece of Mar-a-Lago toilet paper. THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS. When I confronted him about taking money from our children's college fund, he said ""Trump University will be reopened and make education great again."" I couldn't make this shit up if I tried.

Every dinner conversation somehow turns into a Trump sermon. He'll randomly shout ""STOP THE STEAL"" during family meals. When our 15-year-old daughter got an A+ on her history project about the Civil War, he accused her teacher of being a ""communist infiltrator"" for not teaching ""the truth about Trump's victory.""

Our bedroom... God, I'm mortified to even type this. He insists on keeping a giant Trump portrait above our bed because ""Trump watches over us."" He even got a Trump tattoo on his chest and keeps trying to convince me to get one too. He calls it his ""Mark of Patriotism.""

His entire personality has been consumed. He changed his wardrobe to only red clothing. He refers to himself as a ""Digital Soldier"" and spends hours posting on Truth Social. When I asked him to help with our son's homework, he said he was too busy ""fighting the deep state online.""

The paranoia is getting worse. He installed cameras around our house to ""watch for Antifa."" He thinks our neighbors are ""deep state agents"" because they have a pride flag. He threw out our coffee maker because ""Starbucks is funding the radical left."" He even accused our golden retriever of being ""suspiciously woke"" because she didn't bark at a Biden commercial.

Our sex life? He insists on playing Trump rally speeches in the background and keeps trying to get me to wear a Melania mask. I wish I was joking. He has different MAGA hats for different occasions - including one specifically for ""bedroom patriot time."" I'm dying inside.

I found receipts showing he's donated over $15,000 to various Trump-related causes this year alone. Money we needed for our mortgage. When I showed him our overdue bills, he said ""Trump will fix the economy and make us rich."" We're facing foreclosure, but he keeps buying Trump merchandise.

Yesterday, he announced he's legally changing his name to ""Donald J. Trump Smith"" and wants our kids to follow suit. Our 10-year-old son started crying, and my husband told him ""real patriots don't cry"" and made him watch four hours of rally footage as ""testosterone training.""

I've tried everything - marriage counseling (he called the therapist a socialist), family interventions (he disowned his own mother for suggesting he get help), even pleading with his Trump-supporting friends to tell him he's going too far. Nothing works. He just goes deeper into the rabbit hole.

The worst part? Under all this Trump worship, I know my real husband is still in there somewhere. Sometimes, late at night, I catch glimpses of the man I married. But then morning comes, he puts on his MAGA hat, salutes the Trump cutout, and the cycle begins again.

Edit: Please stop DMing me about joining your ""Trump Wives Support Group."" I appreciate the thought, but I'm not interested in your MLM scheme selling Trump-themed essential oils.

Edit 2: Yes, I've already hidden our important documents and started a secret savings account. And no, I won't sell you his ""rare"" Trump toilet paper, even if you're offering Bitcoin.

Edit 3: To the people saying ""this can't be real"" - I wish I was creative enough to make this up. Come visit for dinner sometime. Hope you like hamberders while watching Tucker Carlson reruns on loop.",1,1739043854.0,copypasta,0,1.0,False
1ikvq1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesperateHousewives/comments/1ikvq1q/so_teri_was_really_the_problem_all_along/,So Teri was really the problem all along?,"I follow a YouTube channel called ""Coffee & Cults"" that recently did a deep dive into all the drama surrounding Desperate Housewives. This is the link of the video if anyone is interested: https://youtu.be/QUOdi1hnBP4?si=XNQ8FWJdlhGj56N7

She took a look into the Vanity Fair photoshoot fiasco, the alleged jealousy between the actresses because of the awards, Eva Longoria's references of a bully on set throughout the whole series, the actresses's gift to the crew at the end of the series excluding Teri...but nobody could confirm if the bully was actually Teri, because nobody accused her directly.

However, in her next video (analyzing the drama behind Grey's Anatomy), she mentions that someone that used to work on Desperate Housewives approached her after she released the video, and basically confirmed that Teri was a nightmare to work with. She even explained that the Vanity Fair incident went all the way back to an incident that happened during the pilot. What happened was that, due to pilots having a tight budget, Teri and Marcia had to share a make-up person. Teri went in first, they did her make-up, and then went out to shoot her scenes. Then, this person had to do Marcia's make up so that she could do her scenes, but Teri wanted them to go with her to set to do touch ups. Logically, the make-up person said they couldn't do it, because Marcia had no make-up on and she had to do her scenes, and Teri was so pissed off that it basically turned into a big argument.

I know this isn't definitive proof of anything, but to me, it shatters the perception that I had of Teri as a misunderstood loner and the other three being a clique that basically left her out.

I know this might seem like a naive question, but I genuinely wonder about it. I've been with my partner for almost 8 years, and he's been incarcerated for the past two. Honestly, it’s been the safest I’ve felt in a long time. Before all of this, our relationship was abusive — both physically and emotionally. He was the type of guy who would throw anything in sight when angry. I have countless pictures of bruises, and he’s broken three of my phones. One time, he even hit me in the face with a stainless steel bottle, breaking half of my front tooth. I’d go to work with popped blood vessels in my eyes, and had to wear heavy makeup to cover black eyes or scratches from being dragged across the floor.

The triggers were often small things — not giving him a kiss in the morning, forgetting to lock the balcony door, I made his instant coffee too watery. Once, he cracked eggs on my head because he felt I gave him attitude. Afterward, he’d apologize and shower me with love, and things would calm down for a while.

I tried to leave twice, even working with a woman’s helpline to make a plan, but I never followed through. Then, he got arrested for something unrelated, and I moved back in with my family.

I am still completely traumatized by everything that happened, I have nightmares. But I continue to support him through phone calls and visits. Part of me can’t bear the thought of him being isolated without me. I’m his only support. He keeps telling me how sorry he is and how he’s changed. He insists he would never hurt me again and that his time in jail has given him a new perspective on things and he realizes how much he took me for granted. He asks me for one more chance. 

But I’m not convinced. There's a part of me, though, that is struggling to let go because he’s been my partner for so long. How can I go back to someone who treated me like that but why am I so attached? I’m so confused and just looking for some perspective/advice here. ",1,1739043577.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

Last month I bought a KINGrinder K6 to use with my Cafelat Robot. Before that I used a manual Timemore C2 copycat which took 1 minute and 40 seconds to grind fine enough for espresso. I got the model with the bent handle as depicted in the photo.

(TLDR: K6 was performing terribly until reassembled, now it's amazing)

Assembled the K6 as per the instructions: removed the o-ring on the lid and place the small ring that's included to join the lid and the handle. I ground some medium roast beans at 60 clicks to ""break in"" the grinder. All good. Then I hit a (metaphorical) wall: I dialed the grinder down to 40 clicks to try grinding for espresso (to use on my Robot)... it was very hard. Very difficult to turn, and very slow. 1 minute and 40 seconds for 17g, just like my Timemore C2 copycat, but much harder to turn, choppy, and the output was way too coarse for espresso. Salvaged a turbo shot of sorts, but definitely not good enough. Tried dialing down to 30 clicks: unusable. Had to place the grinder on my lap to turn it, took 2 minutes to grind 17g, and output was still not fine enough for espresso!

This persisted for 2 weeks of almost daily use. Did not get any easier. Did not grind any finer. Too hard. Too slow. Too coarse. Was it defective? Or just an awful grinder in general?

The grinder comes with (limited) instructions for disassembling, so proceeded to watch a couple of videos on youtube of people disassembling it and gave it a try. Figured perhaps the pieces had been assembled at an angle that made the spring too stiff, or perhaps something got stuck during my first breaking-in grind. Adjusted the coarseness to the max, proceeded to take off the clip that holds the mechanism together, and cleaned everything thoroughly. Then gently pressed the spring repeatedly until it felt responsive and not stiff. Reassembled the grinder (still at max coarseness) using tweezers to put the clip back. Took 5 seconds. No drama.

Tried grinding 17g of the same medium roast coffee at 40 clicks with the reassembled K6. Took 35 seconds. Effortless. Expecting the worst, I looked at the outputs and... beautiful, clearly espresso fine. Made a 40ml shot in 30 seconds at \~7 bar. Incredible taste, body, everything. Bright, sweet, etc. Much better than any shot ever pulled with the previous grinder.

I googled whether some people had struggled with the hardness of their new K6 and sure enough, there are a few instances of people finding it excruciatingly hard to use. Clearly a small minority of users, but still. I have now used it daily for a few weeks and it is nothing short of fantastic. From hard light roasts to decaf, Italian dark roasts, and everything in between, the K6 has been delightful. Powerful. Fast. Very happy with my purchase, and would definitely recommend to others.

Leaving this review up here in case it's useful to other new K6 owners stumbling upon this issue.

If you have never owned a manual grinder before do not assume that your new grinder has this problem just because it takes some effort to grind. It does take some effort, it is exercise. But if an adult reasonably fit male is struggling to rotate both the right and left hands while grinding dark roasted coffee, then you might want to consider doing a deep clean and reassembling. There are risks to doing this. Apparently your clicks might be messed up and all your previous recipes/dials will be lost as a result... but since mine was essentially unusable before this was no big loss. Some people apparently have a very hard time putting the clip back in, and it is easy to lose, so do be careful, weigh in the risks, and make sure you know what you are doing.

Best of luck to everyone and happy brewing!",3,1739043411.0,CafelatRobot,1,1.0,False

Hello! So, I'm 22 years old and I weight 59kg and my height is 1.63cm. I'm a healthy weight, but I used to weight a bit less and It has given me a bit of body issues.

I would like to lose wait slowly but surely, nothing to drastic, 3-4kg over a few months, is that realistic?

I do pretty much 0 exercise, and that's something I would like to change. Since I can't go from 0 to a 100 overnight, I was planning on doing some light exercise everyday to build resistance, like 30-50 minutes of light cardio (because I know that's something I would stick to). After building a better physical condition, I was thinking about jogging, since It seems fun. I don't want any complicate routines because I know I wouldn't stick to them, and I also don't want to but a gym membership at the moment because money's tight.

About my usual diet; I believe I eat pretty well. I could use more protein and more fruits though, other than that I alwas cook my meals at home and I don't usually buy processed food. I can't stand breakfast, so usually I skip directly to lunch, sometimes it's a bit carb heavy (pasta or rice dishes) but I pretty much always incluye veggies, and minimum oil (I nevera fry anything). Afternoon snack is always a milk coffee (no sugar, no creamer) + something sweet, sometimes a tiny piece of chocolate, sometimes a slice of cake (I looove baking), dinner is usually on the lighter side, and sometimes a second milk coffee. The main change I would implement is eating less sweets, maybe only baking something monthly instead of bi weekly? Maybe cutting out the second coffee as well and instead having some tea (sugarless). I don't want to give up baking completely since I love it.

Is my goal feasible with the exercise I have planned and only some tweaks to my diet? Are some more heavy changes required? Thanks a lot!! I really want to do some easy changes so I don't give up, I don't care how long I'll have to wait to see weight loss.",3,1739043337.0,loseit,3,1.0,False

How should I handle this?,"For context she (23F) left me (24M). This was exactly 2 weeks ago. Her reasons were the classic I'm not ready for a relationship, I'm not ready to commit, I don't think I was single long enough since my last relationship. I was taken by surprise, that was the hardest thing for me to deal with. I'm doing okay. We didn't talk at all after the breakup.

Fast forward to last week, my friends convince me to break no contact. They said ""you should ask for closure"", ""you'd be dumb not to reach out again"", ""my ex and I left each other multiple times the same way and we'd keep talking and got back together"" etc. I listened to them and texted her. Instant regret.

I realized that I don't need closure. I do want her back but I know I can't convince her to do that. 

I should also mention that she sounds pretty cold over text. She's not mean or anything but it's very obvious that this is not going to be a getting back together kind of talk. She seems very resolute.

I didn't cancel for two reasons. First, she was nice enough to agree to meet. I would feel terrible cancelling when she made that effort. Second, I thought that cancelling might not look too good. Like maybe at this point the best thing I can do is show up, be nice and polite and that's it.

I don't know if I should mention the relationship and try to understand her better. I don't know if I should tell her what I think now that I've had time to process things.

Advion and boric acid have been placed and they are dying! Yay. Made coffee this morning and at the very last sip I had something hard in my mouth - immediately spat out a roach. It was hiding in our milk frother maybe dead before frothing and I didn't see it. Feel bad for me.  Alpine is on its way to really nail-in-coffin this whole experience.

While I could have checked Discogs for price comparisons, I felt the prices were reasonable, the records were in good condition, and supporting a local shop was worth it, so I decided I didn't mind paying a little extra.

1ikvdug,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_RevolutionaryTop6590/comments/1ikvdug/do_you_really_want_to_earn_more_money/,Do YOU Really Want To Earn More Money?,"I see it all the time.

People posting on Reddit saying, “I want to make $6,000 a month.” or “I want to earn $100K a year.”

That’s great. But do you actually want to put in the work to make it happen? Or is it just a dream?

See, I don’t just talk about making money—I’ve done it.

In 2023, my car business in Colorado did $5.8 million in sales. That’s not luck. That’s understanding how money is actually made in America.

And I’m about to break it down for you.

---

Step 1: Understand LEVERAGE

If you’re trading your time for money, you’ll always be stuck. Period.

Look at Starbucks:

The baristas work hourly. If they don’t clock in, they don’t get paid.

The CEO makes money whether he works or not. He gets a salary, stock options, and bonuses based on the company’s overall performance.

See the difference? The CEO leverages an entire company of people making coffee all day, and that’s why he’s rich.

If you’re stuck thinking “I just need a higher-paying job,” you’re missing the bigger picture.

---

Step 2: You Need a Product to Sell

You can’t just “want more money.” Money follows sales.

What are you selling? Beer? Wine? Coffee? Clothes? Advertising? Cars? Houses? It doesn’t matter—but you need a product.

And if you’re smart, you’ll pick something people buy over and over again.

A family with three cars? That’s three potential sales from one client. A coffee shop? That’s repeat customers every morning.

---

Step 3: What Makes You Different?

Why should someone buy from you instead of the competition?

If I buy your coffee, do I get free Wi-Fi?

If I buy an ad on your platform, how many people will see it?

And if very few people will see it, I might not care—if it's cheap enough and I can earn money from it.

How does your offer compare to others?


If you don’t stand out, you’ll always struggle.

---

Step 4: Know Your Costs

Here’s where people mess up.

You get a great idea. You start a business. And then you realize… Wait, this is expensive.

Restaurants in NYC and LA open and close all the time. Why? Their burn rate is too high. Rent, fees, employees—meanwhile, they’re just trying to sell a burger for $15 and praying enough people walk through the door.

If your costs are too high, you’re just working for your landlord and vendors.

---

Step 5: Be Careful with Loans, VCs & Partners

I’ve had business partners. I’ve had investors.

Here’s the first question you need to ask: “What’s my exit strategy when things go south?”

I had a company worth $10M—but my business partners and VCs? Clueless.

The second they saw a big valuation, everything changed.

People watch Shark Tank thinking getting money is the goal. It’s not. You have to count the cost of that money.

---

Step 6: Profit Margins Matter More Than Revenue

A lot of people brag about how much revenue they make. That doesn’t mean anything if your margins suck.

If you sell a $10 product, you might have to mark it up 2.5x, 5x, even 10x just to stay competitive.

But if your net profit is only 5% or 10%, is it worth it? Investors avoid low-margin businesses for a reason. They can make 5%–10% in the stock market with zero effort.

---

So Where Does Freak Sites Fit In?

That’s why I built FreakSites.com.

Most people never make real money because they don’t have the right vehicle to get there.

I created a system where anyone can make money with zero risk and zero overhead—just by being an affiliate.

How It Works:

✅ You sign up for FREE as an affiliate.
✅ You promote three websites:

HousingFreak.com (Real estate ads)

CarsFreak.com (Car-related ads)

TravelersFreak.com (Travel listings & discounts)
✅ You earn commissions on every sale.

---

The Pay Structure (50% Payouts)

30% on your direct sales

10% on your sub-affiliates

5% on their sub-affiliates

+ Two more bonus levels

---

The Math: Your Earning Potential

Let’s break it down:

Sell 1,000 ads in a year (~3 per day) → You earn $15,000.

If 10% of those customers become affiliates (100 affiliates), you earn 10% of their sales.

If those 100 affiliates sell 500 ads each, that’s 50,000 total sales.

Even if just 10% of them become affiliates (5,000 people), you still earn 5% of their sales.

💡 Do the math yourself, and you’ll realize just how scalable and massive of an income opportunity this is.

And here’s the real kicker…

---

Why This Wouldn’t Even Be Possible 10 Years Ago

I can pay out 50% of revenues to affiliates because this is a virtual product with almost no overhead.

Think about it—if I were selling a physical product, I’d have to:
✔ Manufacture it
✔ Package it
✔ Ship it
✔ Handle returns
✔ Manage employees
✔ Rent storage space

With all those costs, I couldn’t afford to pay affiliates 50% of every sale. It just wouldn’t work.

But because this is an online classified ad platform, my costs stay low—and that’s why you can earn so much from it.

This kind of opportunity didn’t exist 10 years ago because the tech wasn’t there. Now it is. And that’s why this is the perfect side hustle for 2025.

---

So, Do You REALLY Want to Make More Money?

Or are you just going to keep dreaming about it?

This is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It’s real. It’s scalable. It’s how Starbucks, Amazon, and every major company operates—except now you can use the same principles for yourself.

So what’s it going to be?

Keep hoping things magically change?

Or start building something that can actually pay you?

1ikvad1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ikvad1/aita_for_blocking_my_childhood_friend/,AITA for blocking my childhood friend?,"Hey,
This is going to be long but I want to include all of the important details:

I (36F) have known Jessi (36F) since we were 4 years old. Growing up in a small village, we spent most of our childhood and youth together. We’ve been supporting each other throughout many times: her coming out as a lesbian, relationships, both of our parents passing away, etc.
Over the years, we’ve had issues and fights, causing us to go no-contact for days/weeks/even months, but we always reconnect and stayed friends.
The most difficult part for me was her obsessive and needy behavior. moreover, she tends to lie and get defensive when she gets caught, and often would even attack back and play the victim.
Around 2 years ago, she started an argument in our friends group, complaining about us not available to meet her (although she has the least flexible schedule) and one of our other friends (Sarah, 36F) confronted Jessi and made it clear that she’s not going to cancel plans just so we could meet spontaneously. After this argument, which included many accusations towards us by Jessi, I decided to go no-contact again and calmly explained Jessi that I refuse to be a part of this friendship if that’s how she feels about me.

Fast forward to 2 years later, she reached out and wanted to reconnect. I was recently diagnosed with cancer, so I thought it would be best to accept her invitation for coffee, and share with her the details, before she would hear it from somebody else. However, I was very clear that I’m into casual friendship, since I have limited time for my social life, so she won’t expect an intensive connection like before.
We finally met and the conversation went well. Jessi told me she started therapy and apologized for her behavior over the years, admitting some of it was out of jealousy and sense of ownership over me. She also shared some things about her abusive relationship with her father. After opening up, I shared with her the news about my health. she was shocked, and took it very hard, she nearly cried and I had to calm her down. 

Few weeks later, I went through a surgery and had a really rough time at the hospital. Since I wasn’t available, she was in touch with my mom and wanted to come visit me. I didn’t want to have visitors during the days I was not feeling well, but when I got better I invited her to come. Unfortunately, I got worse that evening and couldn’t handle the pain. At this time she was already downstairs at the hospital (she lives nearby). My mother met her there and told her that I am currently suffering from severe pain. It didn’t stop Jessi from insisting (and probably manipulating my mom) to come up to my room “just to say hello”.
At this point I was crying and moaning so bad from the pain and couldn’t even turn around to see her. After few moments she left and the next day she texted me sharing how worried she was and how she told my mom that I would never let anyone see me in this condition. That line made me angry since I realized that she was total aware of my boundaries. She wanted to come visit me again, but I told her that I would rather that she would join Sarah when she’ll come visit me at home after I’ll leave the hospital. On Thursday I told Jessi that I’ll probably be home on Saturday and asked her to be in touch with Sarah so they would come together. However, Jessi didn’t contact Sarah, and Sarah came on her own to visit me on Saturday (she was 40-weeks pregnant at the time).
The following Sunday, Jessi contacted Sarah asking her if she wants to schedule a visit at my place. Sarah said that she already did and probably won’t be able to go again this week, to which Jessi replied: “oh really? I wish I knew that before. I would have joined you”. I got really mad, since she obviously knew about it but chose to disappear and lie about it. Immediately I felt all the anger towards her from past years rising up and didn’t want anything to do with her.

A month later she finally reached out again and said that she didn’t contact me since she needed some space from everything. At first she acted like she doesn’t know why am I upset, to which I replied: “I don’t like it when you act innocent” and then she knew exactly what I was referring to and didn’t even apologize, just kept saying that she needed space and asked for my understanding.
I said that I understand and respect her needs, however it doesn’t change the fact that I felt she was being dishonest and disrespectful towards my boundaries. After that I blocked her. I don’t want her to have any access to me, since I know that in few weeks/months she will reach out again and manipulate me to reconnect.

For those who have done this **for over six months**, how has it changed you?

* Is your **mind sharper** than before?
* Has your **intuition, intellect, or creative power** expanded?
* Can you **visualize more vividly**, **plan more effectively**, and **act with greater clarity**?
* Has your **inner world deepened**, and do you feel more in control of your **thoughts, emotions, and direction in life**?
* How has this affected your **ability to deal with people, pursue goals, and think critically**?
* More self control?

I’m also curious about your **routine**:

* Do you journal **first thing in the morning**, during the day, or at night?
* Do you **sit in front of a view, in a library, or in an office**?
* Do you **pair it with coffee, tea, or just the stillness of the moment**?

And i thought about it a moment and said it has one hole in it, like a donut or a tunnel. And he said yes that's right and went on to elaborate about why saying it has two holes is stupid.

He pointed to a short cup and a coffee mug sitting on the table in front of us, and started to explain some complicated things about topographers saying a cup could be reshaped into a donut so that's why it has one hole in it and the coffee mug has two.

I really didn't understand what this has to do with the conversation at all. He asked me more questions about it and I kept saying I didn't know how this was relevant basically. He quickly lost his temper and looked up a YouTube video that showed a mug turning into a donut and saying something about topography and afyer thirty seconds he paused it and was like ""now do you understand?""

I said I still don't know what this has to do with how many holes are in a straw? So now he is getting irrate and I open chat gpt on my phone to see what it would say if I ask it how many holes are in a straw.

One of his pet peeves is that he hates that I use chat gpt (I do love it and have at least 40+ chats with it a day) so this made him more mad but he asked if it said the same thing he was saying and I tried to say.. ""uh no it's not saying anything about topography and reshaping a mug into a donut""

But he lost his temper and called me a liar because the chat did say that a straw has one hole in it. And he said I was gas lighting him and rotting my brain with ai. And then he slapped my thigh really hard several times and eventually demanded I go be in time out in our room.

I have to add the caveat that I've consented to physical violence because we have a d/s type of dynamic but he hasn't been violent very often since I became pregnant and we kind of agreed he wouldn't hit me while I'm pregnant.

Twenty minutes go by and he comes in and claims I started the argument by saying a straw has two holes in it. I never said that, I never thought that.. Now he is wanting to sleep on the couch and this is the second big fight he started in a week.

I'm really sick of it and I would just apologize if I could but sorry wouldn't be enough, I would need to explain why I was wrong in detail and with these impossible fights (we literally never even disagreed!) It's so hard to do that..",1,1739042381.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I’ve been experiencing an unsettling pattern where I wake up around 6–7 AM, much earlier than I’d like, and immediately feel extremely “wired.” It’s like an unwanted surge of energy that I can’t seem to shake off. Physically, I notice restless legs, heavy or fatigued arms, and an overall burning sensation from the inside out.

I’ve observed that coffee definitely worsens these feelings, so I avoid it. I’ve also tried to steer clear of running or intense workouts since they often leave me crashing afterward. I know that incorporating breathing exercises or meditation might help, but when my mind is in full-on panic mode, sitting calmly seems nearly impossible. It feels like my body and mind are in a loop where one makes the other worse.

I’m curious—has anyone else experienced similar early morning dysregulation? What strategies or techniques have helped you manage this state of hyper-arousal? Whether it’s specific breathing methods, gentle movement practices, or any other form of self-care, I’d really appreciate your insights.

For background, I helped at the host stand and as a server during a morning brunch rush.  

While I was helping the host stand these three people came in a girl and two guys in track suits.  The girl spoke in a British accent and was confused when we told her that there was a wait because we all our servers had full sections and we told her that she could give us her number and text her back.  

She looked like we just insulted her and one of the track suit guys came up to my colleague and asked what the problem was and insulted her for giving poor service along with his other track suit friend.  I don't know what country they were from their accents were a mixture of Eastern European and British.  A manager came and defused the situation offering to seat them at the bar which was open seating and just glared at my coworker and would complain every minute that they weren't seated (the wait time was like 5-10 minutes).  

I just told a buser to clean a table and we eventually sat them after they started complaining about the service while they waited, particularly the track suit guys.  I led them to their table and they were surprisingly polite to me but when their server came they were super rude to her especially since they wanted a drink we didn't offer (it was some kind of coffee that we didn't have I don't remember what it was but even the experienced baristas didn't recognize it).   They would call her a stupid monkey when she couldn't understand their accents.  

Me and a food runner helped and they were polite to us but the server they were just rude to her and would talk to her like she was stupid and didn't know anything.  Eventually they paid and surprisingly they left a tip but with a note calling the girl at the host stand a bitch among other slurs (she was black).  

Side note but we all talked about them after the shift ended and we noted that they were only hostile to the server I was helping and the girl at the host stand who were both black and were ok with me, the manager, and the food runner who weren't.    But hey at least they tipped.  

Is it not common to put your name down on a waiting list in the UK/ EU?  Other European tourists I've served never had an issue with it and while they can be curt I usually find Europeans to be low maintenance.  I just find the situation a littler hilarious looking back on it, they were so pissed that they had to wait 5 minutes and that we didn't have this super specific coffee.

Listening to Linus state that they just can't do a video on a new motherboard, there needs to be something to go with it.  Also about merch and figuring out new revenue streams from that.

There is the new board for Framework and they were spitballing what else it could be used with.  Why not try to make a PC in a Breville / Sage Barista Touch and at the same time launch a coffee mug or a smaller water bottle intended for coffee and or tea?  And they intend to make the PC for James Hoffmann, with him trying out a new mug / water bottle.  The water tank should be big enough for it and they can change it over to be hard lined.",3,1739041816.0,LinusTechTips,1,1.0,False

1ikuy0r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dream/comments/1ikuy0r/a_boy_and_his_stoat/,A boy and his … stoat?,"I had a dream I had a stoat as a pet. It was a little different than most stoats for a few reasons. For one, its face was sort of catlike in that it had pointed ears and slitted green eyes. It was also highly intelligent and knew how to do things like pick locks and speak. I think it had a name too, but I don’t remember what, just that it sounded Greek. It accompanied me everywhere by either following me or sitting on my shoulders. It helped me out with all sorts of little things like bringing me lost or misplaced items (usually small things like keys, jewelry or missing socks). It had the ability to literally sniff out people’s intentions and also helped me with problems I was stuck on during my homework. Then at one point I was back in the coffee shop where I do most of my studying because I hate my dorm room and it turned to me and I noticed it had three eyes. It said, “you know I’m you’re familiar, right?” Then I woke up.

Funny thing is is that I’ve been having dreams about my *cat* having three eyes. In the dreams she’s just sort of sitting by me calmly, slow-blinking and purring. And when I wake up she’s always right next to my head. I just think that’s a weird coincidence.",1,1739041741.0,Dream,0,1.0,False

degassed the bag for 3 weeks, floral cup with light to medium sweeteness so far. tasted and smelled very similar to the ethiopian beans i dialled-in in the past. Heard some people on the sub ranting about how savorworks messed up the roast profile compared to C7 geisha that was released last year… i beg to differ because imo this tastes exactly like the cups i got from C7! sadly its out of stock now otherwise i would’ve gotten another bag.

I went there yesterday for a latte because I was running errands and in the neighbourhood. The female staff seemed nervous and unsure of herself, kept going into the back to ask questions. I noticed a sign on the cooler where the pastries are usually displayed that said it was out of order, and the items were sitting on top in plastic bags. When I ordered my Latte, the girl seemed unsure and then a guy who looked like a bouncer came out to take my payment. He was not too friendly and his eyes were piercing and cold. When I sat down someone in the back, a different man, was yelling at someone on the phone, swearing, and it was extremely loud. I had ordered the Latte for inside but changed it to a to-go cup and left. The floor looked like it hadn't been mopped for some time. It's too bad, as it was a great place when Gina, the previous owner ran it. Don't think I'll be back, sad to say. 😒",4,1739041516.0,Winnipeg,7,0.56,False
1ikuufc,https://www.reddit.com/r/Dhaka/comments/1ikuufc/academia_dating_and_everything_in_between/,"academia, dating, and everything in between","no purpose in writing this, im just bored and thought i could vent. I've been studying pretty seriously this past year for hsc and admissions and somehow ended up meeting a really nice girl at a coffee shop. We instantly clicked and basically started seeing eachother. It was supposed to be sth casual since she's a med student and I'm fucked trying to pass chemistry, but things kept getting more serious(?).

  
We're not dating, at least we're not wearing labels. But I'm def exclusive to her and she is pretty much as well. I have not let myself fantasize the idea of having feelings, the last time that happened shit was bad bad bad. I dont want to go down that rabbit hole again and have my academia fucked. And i think she has developed feelings for me, which i wouldve reciprocated to, if i hadnt been under current academic circumstances.  

  
That being said, ei rant er kono aga matha nai and kono purpose nai, i dont have any questions either, but i needed to talk ab this cos i think i'm clearly burdened by this. I'm not used to having someone be attached to me emotionally, and she is VERY and i mean VERY understanding, but still i just dont know. 

  
I keep coming back to, what if i get attached and fuck up hsc and admission, amar toh cd gey guru hoye jaabe.

I'm a 33-year-old guy who loves to create. One of my favorites ways to create and be somewhat creative is to cook delicious food, learn new techniques in the kitchen and satisfy my hungry friends.

I'm here for something a bit different right now. An open-minded, adventurous, and creative female chef or cook that shares her creations with me. We will talk about new techniques and maybe share some gourmet food pics. Having a flirty angle to the chat would be a plus.

What I love outside cooking:

* Enjoying a good cup of coffee while engaging in deep conversations
* Watching and discussing our favorite Netflix shows (I'm a huge adventure/sci-fi fan!)
* Admiring tattoos and humans
* Laughing at corny dad jokes and indulging in witty, sarcastic humor

Looking forward to hearing from you!

1ikupd4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ikupd4,"Meet my OC, Widget Cogs: the dumb... But actually smart Engineer with PhD","Hi everyone! This is actually an old oc of mine, these pictures are somewhat old too but he's been roaming in my mind for awhile now so I thought I'd share this fella in my brain with you guys :). 
The title pretty much sums up his entire character, well not really but I'll write this out in detail for y'all hehe!

Widget is a VERY intelligent stallion, with a PhD in engineering. He's very quick when it comes to crafting and fixing things. Which is why Erebus came to him in the first place, albeit... Not expecting his quick service but he's definitely a talk of the town because of his skills.... What others don't know is that Widget is also ahead of his time! With one of his inventions being ""Mini Cannons"" (aka. GUNS!) and ""The Emperor Bomb"". 

Widget however... Is easily distracted, he has a short attention span and sometimes couldn't keep up with his work. But when he became very enthused and focused with his work, he barely gets any sleep and won't stop working until it's done. Sometimes a few cups of coffee can hold him but the more the drank the more his body became numb to high amount of caffeine. 

Social wise, his distraction problem is also apparent. As Widget would have trouble keeping up with conversations sometimes and would often change topics or talk about the same topics/questions all over again without noticing.

1ikup7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnancy_care/comments/1ikup7r/i_cant_breathe/,I cant breathe.,"I am 10 weeks pregnant with my 4th. I have been so incredibly out of breath and short of breath since before i found out. So probably since about 4 weeks pregnant. I had an appointment with my primary care doctor to go over labs and i mentioned that i’d had a positive pregnancy test like 2 weeks prior and that im so incredibly out of breath. he listens and diagnoses me with asthma at the ripe old age of 25! but the inhaler doesnt help! ive had it for a week now and it doesn’t do anything. 
Now im pretty active. i was going for walks almost everyday for almost 2 years now. i got a walking pad for the colder months. i don’t get winded easily. i cannot walk to the bathroom without being incredibly winded. once again, 10 WEEKS PREGNANT!! nothing is being pushed into my lungs yet. 
I also have crippling anxiety because my last pregnancy and labor was verrrrry traumatic and stressful. I would chalk this up to anxiety if i hadn’t started the symptoms BEFORE finding out i’m pregnant. 

Im wondering if anyone else has experienced this? Im not audibly wheezing. i hit my inhaler and im still out of breath. it feels like my lungs are full of water sometimes. i haven’t vaped/smoked in 3 years. im sitting here drinking a cup of coffee freaking out because i. can’t. breathe. i’m going to call my ob on monday obviously but im still asking if any of you have dealt with this, this early on.

1ikup60,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ikup60,RIP sweet baby T,"Thunder (aka Lil T) and I have had the same morning ritual since we moved into our home about 7 years ago. He’ll wake me up telling me it’s time to go outside and then go back in for breakfast. We live in a neighborhood with other indoor/outdoor cats and they all just patrol their own property letting them know this was their home. Lil T did the same. There was never any altercations, just puffy tails and warming growls at first. After a while, they all just stay in their perceptive yards. Lil T likes to play in the leaves and Chatter at the squirrels and birds and go potty while I have my morning coffee. When we’re done, we go back inside and I feed the animals and freshen up their water bowls. Then I eat and do whatever tasks need to be done before work. 24 hours ago was just the same. Instead of doing the task I decided to take a nap. Wherever I go, my little band cats and dogs follow. I nuzzle up on the couch and when napping this is the usual layout. Me on my side in a loose fetal position, in front of my chest and under the covers, my oldest cat Jupiter nestles, Lil T will take the spot behind my legs and Jupiter’s son ,Apollo, will loaf on top of me on my side. But yesterday, Lil T makes the move for Jupiter’s spot at my chest and starts purring. I ask him if he likes the Upgrade and he continues his purring and tucks his lil beans in. Jupiter just loafs on top of the couch and Apollo assumes his position on my side. We take a nice little nap, waking briefly to adjust positions. Lil T likes to bathe Apollo’s face and ears and does so before moving back to my feet. Continue nap. I wake up hot due to all the body heat and I see Lil T loafing on the floor between Dash ,our Corgi, and the couch. I start to get up and see a puddle on the kitchen tile. Dash is about 13/14 y/o. I took him outside before Lil T and I went outside. So I assume he just pooped and didn’t pee. So I go to clean it up and when I try to maneuver around Dash and T, Dash Moves and Lil T let’s out a cry. I ask him if he’s okay and he continues to loaf. I quickly clean up the pee and go check on T. He’s moving around slowly and is panting. I assume he’s over heated since I woke up hot. So I pulled the cooling blanket we have from the freezer and place him on it on the kitchen counter, refreshing his water cup with cold water and try to coax him to drink it. He does not. I try to dab some of the cold water on his head to try to cool him down. He’s still panting and moving lethargicly and occasionally cries. At this point it’s time for me to get ready for work. While I’m getting ready his crying has stopped but still sluggish. I ask my Husband to keep an eye on him and if he’s still feeling like that, I’ll take him to the vet tomorrow morning. I go to work worried about him and saying to myself no news is good news since I haven’t heard from my husband about Lil T yet. I get home and immediately ask where T is at. He’s hidden himself between a couch and a chair, and peed on himself more lethargic than before. I quickly and carefully pull him out of the crevice and give him a quick bath. He lets me bathe him and I see some hope when he fights me a little but then continues to lay there. He’s still breathing so I still hope, I swaddle and dry and brush him. And tuck him in bed promising a vet visit 1st in the morning. I wake up at 3am every morning for water and potty, I go check on him and he made his way to the cat room, laying like a donut, still breathing. I prop his head up so he can get more air since his face is on the floor. Give him a kiss and tell him I’ll see him in the morning. I wake up at 9 to check on him and he’s laying on his side, stiff. I know he has passed and I begin to wail. I don’t know what could have taken him so suddenly. My husband tries to tell us, even if we did take him to vet when his cries first started, they probably couldn’t have done much with how fast he went. I am so heart broken and I feel so guilty for not taking him. Can you please tell me what could have happened? 

TL:DR- our sweet baby boy passed unexpectedly on us and we’re heart broken and don’t know what could have happened to him. All we know is that we are grateful for the time and love he has shared with us. After the initial shock wore off I picked a spot to bury him in our back yard and my husband dug a hole and burried him. I’ll be working on a stone to mark his physical presence. I picked a spot to see him from the kitchen and bathroom windows. So if I’m crying while doing dishes, you know why, poke. 
Rest in peace Thunder. I’ll remember and love you always. From our now quiet mornings, the birds chirping, squirrels running amok, your love of crunchy plastic, loafs on your terms, carrying you around our home like a baby. your opinions on our sleep schedule. Our beans will be colder without your beans warming them. We love you sweet baby T. ❤️‍🩹",30,1739041139.0,VoidCats,2,0.97,False

1ikunqa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Btechtards/comments/1ikunqa/hey_college_students_here_are_some_practical_tips/,Hey college students! Here are some practical tips to help you build skills before graduation and also learn how to read research papers and publish your own.,"*Note- AI generated summary of this text is in comments*

>Reading research papers and writing publications

__Reading research papers__

start reading, a lot. Pick one topic from your course. go to google scholar and search that topic. Pick one paper. Read the introduction, then results then conclusion. If you found it interesting, read the methodology and the the rest of the meat. Dont get hung up on any one thing that you dont understand. Preferably, download zotero and the browser plugin and log the paper along with some notes about what you thought about the topic/paper. Then find another paper and repeat. You can find another paper through google scholar or through the references of the previous paper.  You can access papers through university provided login or pirate through scihub. 

__Writing publications__

having done the first half, compile your notes and identify any gaps in the field. search for more online research to fill those gaps. If you cant find it online, take your notes and references to a professor and sit with them for an hour and discuss. If you've put in the work, professors will engage and help you. It would also be helpful it you went to a professor with a topic that they've already spent time working on, find out their research background. 

>__useful skills as a fresher__

these are sometimes very different than research and publication prowess. Go to the linkedin or other job boards of companies (preferably startups) and log all the skills they require for their new hires. Build projects that would require those skills. Don't spend time learning only the skill, spend time building a project that uses the skill. Go to subs about engineers in your domain and ask for specific advise. Keep a log of your project progress in a word document with screenshots and pictures along with reasons for doing what you did. Very important to be able to tell your story in interviews. You'll forget what you did and therefore an explanation of your project that could have been 20 minutes will end up being just 10. The progress and pitfalls are your story. Make a record of them. Find other engineer's personal project blogs and maybe make your own. Don't spend time learning how to built it if you don't know, pay someone ~500INR to build yours. 

All this is general advise and i hope someone benefits from it. Don't depend on campus recruitment, connect with engineers companies directly at companies based on your project, what that means is do advanced projects, send linkedin messages to engineers asking for help with very specific things. Do it a few times and it'll get easier. Ask for maybe a 20 minute meeting and even have a presentation ready if your explanation needs that medium, but the theme is asking for help and advise. 

__Additionally, use a pair of headphones, chill coffee house music playlist and use Pomodoro. Set aside a few hours a week for your future. Your bachelors degree is a professional training course, treat it as such and you will be rewarded.__",5,1739041037.0,Btechtards,2,1.0,False

I am going to use Sobieski vodka since I think the flavour from the rye will pull down the flavour into some bready type areas, as opposed to a rum which would be brighter. (My upgrade pick would be Belvedere, but too expensive for a liquor imo)

My main dilemma is the coffee extraction. For example, the popular Mr. Black is a ""cold brew"". Does that mean the cold brew is made from water and then added to the spirit? I was thinking I could infuse the coffee directly in the spirit, and then dilute with water if I want to. (after adding demerara syrup)

I was also going to add cacao nibs to the infusion to increase the bitterness, but I have also seen orange peel added.

Teacher and student father (M4a or m4f) only discord and Instagram 


I’m the father of my 7-year-old son/daughter—a brilliant but mischievous kid. Recently, I was called to the principal’s office because my child decided to rip up another student’s book. After a stern discussion with the principal, I was directed to visit the class teacher’s room for further guidance.

I knocked on her door, and a soft, sweet voice answered, “Yes, please, come in.” I stepped inside with my child, taking a seat at her desk. The moment I saw her, my attention shifted. She was wearing a traditional saree, draped elegantly, and her natural charm was impossible to ignore. Her warm smile and graceful demeanor made it difficult to focus on the reason I was there.

As she began discussing my child’s results and behavior, I found myself less interested in the report card and more captivated by her. It was as if the world slowed down. Then, almost unexpectedly, she looked at me and asked, “Would you like to meet for coffee?”

Her words caught me off guard, but I quickly replied, “Yes, please,” without hesitation.

What could she possibly want to discuss over coffee? Was it about my child—or something more? I couldn’t wait to find out.

Ever wanted to turn your handwritten notes directly into Anki flashcards? I built [NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) to solve this exact problem! It works with any note-taking app (GoodNotes, Notability, Nebo, OneNote) - all you need is a PDF export.

[Left - PDF notes with flashcard co-existing with normal pages, Right - Only extract flashcard page into Anki](https://preview.redd.it/1w9zp5xqnyhe1.png?width=2726&format=png&auto=webp&s=0225458dc333ba41fa56605c31153e20bb23b369)

# Key Features

* **Works with any note-taking app that can backup to a folder as PDF files**
* **Preserves your handwriting and diagrams**
* **Automatic duplicate detection**
* **Multiple processing modes**
* **Free**

# How It Works

1. Take notes and create flashcards in your favorite note-taking app along with your regular notes. Flashcards can just be another page within your notebook.
2. Export/backup your notes as PDF (e.g., GoodNotes backup to OneDrive)
3. Run [NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) on your PDF folder
4. Your flashcards are extracted from each note and appear in Anki automatically!

# Creating Flashcards

1. **Use the template** ([Download here](https://notesankify.com/flashcard-template/))
2. **Add QUESTION/ANSWER markers** on any page
3. Use any **specific page dimension**.
4. **Split any page** into top (question) and bottom (answer)

# Smart Duplicate Handling

[NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/) uses content hashing to prevent duplicates:

* Same cards across different notes? Added only once
* Made a small change? Treated as a new card
* Your Anki deck stays clean and organized!

# Deck Organisation

* Organise Anki decks with nested sub-decks mimicking the folder structure of your notes.

# Useful Links

* [Website & Documentation](https://notesankify.com/)
* [Download NotesAnkify](https://notesankify.com/#download)
* [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/kpauljoseph/notesankify)

# Why I Built This

I was tired of:

* Manual flashcard creation in Anki
* Being locked into proprietary features (like GoodNotes Studysets)
* Maintaining separate pdf files for notes and flashcards

Special thanks to [u/smponi](https://www.reddit.com/user/smponi/). I've been using their PAPER2ANKI scripts for manually converting my flashcards to Anki, and finally decided to make an automated solution with a user-friendly GUI.

my name's haley! i normally work nights and am temporarily on days and surviving solely on coffee.

i have a dog who is the love of my life and my lil baby. i love animals & wanna have a hobby farm one day.

i enjoy reading, i have a few hundred books in various genres. horror movies are my favorite genre of movies, but i also love fantasy/sci-fi alot! 

 video games are my main hobby when i have free time. (i'm currently hyperfixated on getting achievements in any game i own and depression cycling through games) music is also v important to me and i listen to it every day, i like literally anything that sounds good. send me ur favorite bands!

 i also love swimming & hiking!  but i'm usually a homebody, i love baking treats for people, if we become friends i'll make you yummy desserts anytime, lol. 

diet dr pepper is my shit and i love it so much. if you don't like dr pepper you're wrong and i'll die on my hill

i'm pretty shy at first but i think i'm at least a semi cool person. i have discord like most chronically online people and am cool with chatting there if we vibe! i'd love to make new friends and find people to talk to on a daily basis and build a connection with, and see where it leads. i have pictures on my page if that's important to you.",2,1739039908.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

1iku5ze,https://i.redd.it/88ff8d04myhe1.jpeg,Oudh Al Anfar - so good!,"Bought a bunch of Oudh Al Anfar perfumes from attariessence .com and they are so good! 

Musk Al Ahmar red - dupe of Kayali Juicy Apple

Musk Al Ahmar Violet- dupe of badee al oud amethyst from Lattafa but smoother and lasts longer 

Surreal - dupe of Yara tous but lasts waay longer and is stronger and smells better 

Timeless - dupe of Kayali yum pistachio but way stronger and lasts so long 

Majestic- dupe of Lattafa Yara but waaaay stronger and fruitier and lasts so long 

(Timeless, surreal and majestic are all extrait de parfum so that’s why I think they are stronger too and the two musks also) 

Bara and Bara coffee - lattafa khamrah and khamrah qahwa but so much nicer and smoother and wearable I find lattafa to be too overwhelming when you first spray and these last throughout the day so well (also extrait de parfums) 

Muse - original from them and so sweet and juicy! Citrusy sweet not one I thought I would normally like but it’s beautiful! 

Fouco- spicy sexy men’s scent and the bottle is so beautiful too! My husband and I are both obsessed! 

Definitely buying more from them I’m so impressed!

1iku3xr,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopsmoking/comments/1iku3xr/this_is_going_to_be_a_hard_week/,This is going to be a hard week.,"43 days in. My husband and I quit together, and as usual, we push each other to do better. 

Well, this morning my husband left for a ski trip. Now it's just me and the pets, and I find myself arguing with the addict inside all day long. 

Last night when I went to bed, I was certain I would get up and immediately go buy cigarettes. Instead, I relaxed with some coffee, had a brief personal dance party, took a long shower, walked the dog, and planned my shopping list. By then it was noon - since I'd make it this far, I decided I can make it until tomorrow.

So that's how I'm going to do it. A few hours at a time, and before I know it my husband will be back, and I can lean on him for strength. And he may not know how hard I struggled, but I will be proud of me for not giving in.

1iku2s5,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1iku2s5/just_went_through_a_divorce_and_im_struggling/,Just went through a divorce and I'm struggling...,"Just got divorced and I'm struggling. Sorry for the extremely long post.

I was married for 14 years to a woman (call her ""M"") and it didn't work. She lost respect for me and out of love, I could feel it so I left... I had a girlfriend (call her ""S"") who distracted me along with heavy drinking throughout that time and in retrospect I never processed the divorce. 

About a year and a half later, I met a great woman (call her ""L"") who was a bartender at a place I got lunch and a beer at once in a while. Just like I did, through her divorce she had a boyfriend and drank heavily and never processed the divorce. 

 We hit it off and my girlfriend at the time was angry and a bit crazy and I had already broken up with her once and was on the way out. So we broke up and I hooked up with a woman older than me for a month, all the while going to lunch at the place. 
Well I hit it off with L and she gave me her number. We were both divorcing. Lots in common. She had been married for 12 years or so to an abusive drunk who is a real pos, (call him ""R""). Started shit with me and wanted to fight and all that. A violent loser who smokes meth and drinks himself into a stupor about every day. Always causing drama. We both have 2 boys each by our previous marriages. L is 36, I am 47. We had so much in common and hit it off. We had so much fun together and a year and a half later, we got married. Everything seemed perfect. We went on trips all the time and had a great life together. It was like the stars aligned and everything was meant to be. I was a good step-dad and she was a good step-mom. We made so many great memories and had pictures of us all over the house.

The whole marriage to L she had to communicate with R obviously, but she was very close with his family still and always gossiping with them about him and all in his business and would go rush to help him on several occasions, including picking him up from jail. She would cut me off and say don't worry, don't be insecure which I wasn't. At her kids birthday parties he was there and I could feel the energy between them. Me and R never ended up getting physical because I thought it would be damaging for me to fight him/beat him up due to her kids. Not cool for my stepkids to see or know that. Peace is always better. I boxed for many years and stil train so I dont have anything to prove. She seemed to really hate him and would be disgusted at his behavior and drama. 

After a year of marriage, my wife said she's not happy and was thinking divorce. We talked and she could see how upset I was so she after talking with her mom, decided to give it a chance. She started going out alot, hanging out with his family more and going to concerts, going out drinking with friends,  etc which was fine with me. She is free to do what she wants. She also started sleeping on the couch and doing puzzles and generally being unapproachable. I would go to bed early and she would stay up late watching shows she knew I didn't like and getting up at 5am to do the same, texting whoever and generally avoiding me. I tried to hang out with her but she was being distant so I gave her space. I figured that's what she wants.

I have always suffered from depression and this affected her. She took it personally. I let her in and became vulnerable. She would ask me to show my feelings and communicate. I did and as a result she lost respect for me. She got resentful and bored. 

So I was in a depressed phase for a couple months and on November 1st, one week before our 2 year anniversary, she told me she doesn't love me and wanted a divorce, she's not happy. I didn't take her on dates and wasn't doing the things she told me she needed. 

We owned a house together, we made it a home and we had a great life. I thought she loved me. I was in shock. She all of a sudden was very cold and final about it all. No talking it through, refused counseling. She said she tried everything which obviously she didn't. 

She initially said she would give me a couple months to save money so I could get my own place while she can stay with friends and R's brothers house as she was friends with him and his wife... She refused to stay home with me and said it just makes it harder. 

I would try to talk to her when she came home to get ready for work or came home with her kids for a bit. Mainly she stayed away. There was no talking it through. Quickly she came off giving me months to save up for my own place and gave me until mid December to be out. She was keeping the house. I had to scramble to pack and also get my shit together. 

So she came and stayed the night on a Monday, saying she was super stressed and her back hurt and needed to sleep in bed... I offered her a massage and she said I didn't have to and didn't want to give me the wrong idea, but if I wanted to she would take it. So I did and after, she asked if it would be weird if we had sex... I figured it would be the last time so I said no it would be fine, and we did... We went to sleep holding hands. 

On Saturday morning, I woke up to see texts from both her and R separately with her saying her and R had sex and she didn't want me to hate her but wanted to be honest. He said she had been staying at his house for a month and they had sex and wanted to let me know. I didn't respond to either. I just fell apart. She said she was staying at friends houses and all the while she was at his place. He has a girlfriend and she said he was staying with her the whole time except the night they slept together. 

I was too hurt to be angry. When I was staying with my mom she had R come over to spend the night a couple times because his lease was up and she wanted to help him... She said she and him only had sex the one time. I don't believe her. She said he slept on the couch, not that it matters at this point. She brought him in to muscle me out, saying he's coming and if I don't want the drama, I better go stay at my mom's or exes. I didn't want to assault him or involve the cops, so I did. I stayed at my mom's for 2 weeks while I could get a place of my own.

I got a small depressing shitty apartment. I only had my kids on weekends which I normally have them one week on, one week off. My ex, M told me my older son told her he was worried about me and she asked why, and he said he thought I was gonna kill myself. That woke me up in a way.

I had been shaking uncontrollably especially my limbs and I was struggling at work. I couldn't stop shaking. I'm in physical therapy working with geriatrics in a skilled nursing facility. I couldn't function. I lost 30 lbs during that month. People at work including long term residents were telling me I look like shit. Word got to my boss and she pulled me into the HR office which I'm very friendly with the HR girl, and they basically told me they could see I'm struggling and I'm not fit to work like this, that I need to check myself in somewhere. I was planning suicide at the time so I agreed and the HR girl drove me to a mental health facility and I checked in. I was there 4 days. It was like a jail more than anything. After I was discharged I was on new meds but didn't feel any better. 

Me and L met at a restaurant to talk. We shared a beer and ate and I wrote my feelings on a notepad and read it to her during. I told her where I was. After, we were about to walk to our vehicles and she was standing there looking upset, so I went to hug her. She embraced me and we hugged for like 3 minutes, with her kissing me on the cheek 3 times. We both wept.

About a week later it was new years eve I decided to drink vodka and got very dark and was gonna go through with suicide. I called a close friend (call her ""K"") who she knows everything about the whole story, more than anyone else and she helped talk me down and stop drinking for the night, so I did. She told me to think about my kids and that I have plenty of people who would be devastated if I went through with it, inculding her. The next day she saw me at work and said I looked really bad and I probably need to go back to a mental health facility to check myself in, so again I went to HR and she took me to another facility. 

Again it was like jail. Really fucked up people there. I had a cellmate and there was a shower curtain for a bathroom door, I don't smoke but there were smoke breaks about every 2 or 3 hours, so I would smoke cigarettes and walk the yard. Drank black coffee all day. That's all there was to do. There was 2 therapy sessions per day and I attended all of them. Got my meds adjusted. I was there 6 days this time. I befriended a career criminal who was a fentanyl and meth dealer, as I would bum him cigarettes. He had a good heart and had so many stories of his life about dealing drugs and all his toys and guns he bought from the money and about kicking in doors and robbing people... I learned all the creative ways they had to take meth and fentanyl. It was a fascinating experience. I saw two fights while I was there, including between one of the bouncer dudes who patrolled the place and a patient who had major mental health issues. Dude got power slammed against a wall and flattened... Entertaining. Most of the people there were homeless and/or had major life problems. I looked around and decided this isn't me. I'm not one of them. I have a good job, kids and friends that love me, I have my own place and own car. It could be way worse and I should be grateful. 

I was out of pto and was discharged and let L know where I had been, told her about the almost suicide and she asked if I wanted to meet up again to catch up and talk. I responded by saying I didn't want to be friends and it was better for my mental health to not talk to her. She said ""sounds like a perfect plan, good luck"". 

I've been no contact with her since, other than when she contacted me to give me my tax mail. She gave it to my older son who works with her at her restaurant. Awkward.

Also I texted her about getting my copy of the divorce paperwork so I can get her and one of her kids off my insurance... Since it's not open enrollment I need proof of a life changing event to make changes to the policy. She has yet to contact me and said she would once she gets it in the mail. I plan to have lunch or meet her somewhere to get it and read another thing I wrote about my thoughts about how it went down, which contains no insults but I lay it out about how disgusted I am with her and that it's like a Jerry Springer episode.

Since then I've stopped drinking, as I would drink every day and have for years... I don't know how I did it but I just quit and haven't drank since early January. I've been seeing a psychiatrist for meds and a counselor weekly. I've been working on myself and staying to myself, learning to love myself and my new life, embracing my solitude. Focus on my kids. I have no desire to date or really see anyone. I hadn't been working out due to depression but last week I went to a buddy's house and talked and hit the mitts for a couple rounds and it felt good to get back to what I love- boxing. My older son is 17 and has boxed for a couple years now and goes to the same boxing gym I used to. We are hitting the mitts this weekend which we haven't done since I was in the house. I had a whole boxing ring and all kinds of bags and equipment, gloves, etc and would train anyone who came over, including my kids friends. I had to throw the ring away through a bulk trash service and it broke my heart. I've had that ring for many many years. I had to give all the gloves and bags and equipment to my kids who store it at their moms.

It's all so depressing and deflating. Very traumatic to have someone you really connected with and thought was perfect for you only to have them lose respect, lose their love for you and betray and disrespect you like she did. 

So really long story short, I went through a terrible divorce and ordeal but I'm starting to come through it by changing my destructive self talk and meditating and being sober. I've subscribed to motivational and inspirational subreddits which I read as I scroll through. I'm recovering but still struggling. I've just now got to the point where I can go grocery shopping and pay my bills and self-care like taking showers every day, as it was monumental achievements to do those things weeks ago. I'm back to work and able to function, changing my thinking to work being a safe place and a good distraction.

So for those suffering after a breakup or divorce, know that there is hope. Just work on yourself and get back to doing things you love. Learn to embrace being alone and standing on your own. Be your own man and learn to count your blessings and be grateful. It could almost always be worse. 

TL;DR: I went through a traumatic divorce and almost killed myself but I'm finding purpose and hope. Learning to enjoy my peace. I'm on the road to recovery. ",20,1739039560.0,GuyCry,8,0.89,False

1iku07r,https://www.reddit.com/r/gallbladders/comments/1iku07r/asymptomatic_turns_tragic_2_surgeries_in_3_days/,Asymptomatic turns tragic. 2 Surgeries in 3 days gallbladder removal yesterday; sharing my timeline and experience :),"Hello :) sharing my experience about my  awful journey this week but blessed to be alive today (27F) 

It started Sunday evening, I thought it was just another acid reflux attack but then after taking all the necessary precautions and vomit 4 times pain still didn’t went away. So decided to go to urgent care Tuesday morning the Dr. just gave me Malanta and Lidocaine had relief and advised to see a GI doctor. After 2hours pain came back 2x painful. It’s like someone is stepping in my Right abdomen and breast rib straight to my back 😭

Decided to go to ER in the evening. 
Waiting another 2hrs and they game me Morphine it help tremendously.
They did Ultrasound and MRI. 

Then boom 
Dr. said ; you have gallbladder stones but the one that I am more worried is that the stones came down to a different “tube” on your Pancreas and It is blocking the Liver that is causing you the pain. So I will call a different hospital and transfer you there to take it our immediately bcoz if not It will cause infection and worst eruptions of the Liver. :( oh God. 

Transferred to another hospital (Temecula Valley Hospital) then Wednesday afternoon they did the surgery right away taking the stones by mouth only. And they did a very good job. Amazingly, throat didn’t hurt that much and just a manageable pain still on my abdomen bcoz it’s where they pass the camera and suctions that removed my stones. 
After that surgery, I just requested a Tylenol for pain to make me sleep , no morphine.
Then woke up in the morning , no more pain. 

Around noon of Thursday. GI doctors visit me and asked how am I doing and then gave me the news that the 100% recommended to take my gallbladder out because that’s the source of the stones where there is stones inside btw so mostlikely if I decide not to do it the terrible pain will happen all over again. 

So decided to go will the procedure and was scheduled 1:45pm yesterday.
From my room they took me around 11am on the operating waiting rooms to discuss everything.
1:30pm took me in and they did 4 in cessions with the robot machine :) 
Woke up around 4:30pm then back on my room 5:12pm.
No pain because of anesthesia still, little light headed but I am not worried. Stood up right away and peed 7 times. Lol
Water base foods was given. 
They game me Ibrupofen 12mn then had a good sleep woke up 6am.
Pain manageable, it’s amazing. 
I am blessed to be able to wake up and breathe. 
Vitals on point, no fever and oxygen is perfect.
They draw another blood for last testing to check any signs of infection. Then God willing i’ll out today afternoon and go home :) 


Sorry guys, it’s a little long timeline.
But I hope everyone who is now Who has been through this, who is healing and came here to get POV for what to expect I am proud of yall because we are brave and we will make it. 🙏🏼
It’s all life’s experience for us to learn our lessons that food is the best but with moderation.
I have learned so much. 

Overeating especially last at night, No good
Eating then go laying down in bed, No good
Drinking coffee & carbonated drink with empty stomach, No good
Too much spicy food and vinegary food, No good.
After the pain I went through, I will not be a hypocrite and say I will not be eating and drinking this anymore lol No. 
I still will be bcoz I’m Filipino we love food lol. 
But now I am aware that if we abuse our body we will suffer the consequences sometimes you never know when it will hit you. 🥲 
Just eat moderately, healthy and small portions 3 times a day. 

I hope this is helpful in some way. And Praise God I survived another day and bless me on my recovery. 🙏🏼

1iktyo5,https://i.redd.it/0ou0csfmkyhe1.jpeg,"Our Green Card Journey: 338 Days from Filing to Approval – Thank You, Reddit!","Hey everyone,

I wanted to take a moment to share our timeline and experience in hopes that it helps others going through this process. This community has been so helpful in giving us a better idea of what to expect, how long things might take, and even guiding us when we needed to file an expedite request for our I-131. I truly appreciate this space and hope it continues to be a resource for all of us!

About Us

We are a gay couple, married since June 2022, with a priority date of 03/04/2024. We filed everything by ourselves (no lawyer), and I was actually abroad on Advance Parole for about five months before returning for our interview. Both of us are studying abroad, so this was a unique journey for us!

	•	February 5, 2025 – I-130 and I-485 approved

Interview Experience

We were scheduled for 1:00 PM and arrived at 11:30 AM since somebody gave us a ride. We went through security and waited at a cafeteria before heading up to the waiting room about 30 minutes before our interview. The wait was long—more than an hour before they called my name as the beneficiary.

At first, I was a little nervous because the officer who called us looked serious and intimidating. But I had heard great things about the Newark Field Office, and wow… this officer turned out to be amazing. He was very clear, saying, “This is all I know from your case, so tell me,” while holding up the interview appointment notice.

Apparently, the actual adjudicating officer for our case wasn’t there, so our case was randomly assigned to him. I’m really glad he decided to go ahead with the interview rather than rescheduling it again.

He took us to another floor and reviewed our file for over 30 minutes. That wait was nerve-wracking because we had no idea what he was thinking. When he came back, he asked for extra evidence. We provided joint finances (mostly abroad) and money transfers between our accounts, but he said that might not be enough—though he reassured us that should not be an issue.

Questioning and Fun Moments

	•	He took me in first, swore me in, and asked the usual questions: how we met, our wedding date, how we got to the interview, where we slept last night, what we ate for dinner, and what we wore to bed.

	•	Then my spouse came in and got the same questions.

	•	We had one small difference—I said we didn’t have dinner, just a late lunch at 5:00 PM, while my husband said we had dinner at 7:00 PM. But we both described the exact same meal, so it wasn’t a problem. Differences in answers are okay as long as you can explain why there is a small difference in perception.

	•	The best moment? He asked my husband if we had dessert, and he confidently answered, “Coffee.” The officer laughed and said, “Are you sure? I heard there was a specific sweet you had.” My husband sat there thinking for 15 seconds and then practically yelled, “COOKIE DOUGH ICE CREAM!!” The officer burst out laughing, saying, “How can you forget cookie dough ice cream?”

After covering our studies abroad, plans for the next few months, and my I-693 medical, I signed an update regarding my AP entry. He then printed a letter stating they would keep the case for review, but everything looked good for approval. He just wanted to give it a final review since he had only received the case that same day.

The Big Moment

We left the federal building exhausted but relieved. The next morning, my spouse woke me up saying he saw our I-130 approval under the documents tab. Later that day, we got an email that action was taken, and both I-485 and I-130 were marked as approved.

Lessons and Final Thoughts

	1.	Know how your spouse thinks. When answering questions, I always tried to include details my husband would most likely remember. For example, when asked about our sleeping attire, I described our pajamas but also mentioned that we slept in boxers, knowing my husband would likely only remember that part. Sure enough, when he was asked, he simply said “underwear,” and when the officer followed up with what type, he confidently answered “boxers.” That really helped demonstrate our truthfulness.

	2.	Differences in answers are okay as long as you can explain why there is a small difference in perception. For example, I said our meal was a late lunch at 5:00 PM, while my husband called it dinner at 7:00 PM. We both described the exact same food, and I also mentioned we had ice cream later that night. The officer later asked my husband if we had dessert, and when he first forgot, the officer gently prompted him.

	3.	This process is nerve-wracking, but the right officer can make a huge difference. Our officer was tough but fair, professional but kind.

	4.	This Reddit community is gold. I can’t express how much reading timelines, experiences, and advice helped us prepare—and even push for the expedited I-131 when needed.

This journey has come to an end for now, until applying for citizenship. Wishing the best for everyone still in the process. If you have questions, I’m happy to help!",14,1739039277.0,USCIS,2,1.0,False

It’s not my first grinder, so naturally, I approached it with a mix of optimism and caution. After months of daily use, I’ve come to appreciate its strengths and note its quirks. The brushed stainless steel design is sleek and modern, blending seamlessly with my other kitchen appliances. Though compact in size, it manages to feel sturdy—like it’s built to last.

The grinder’s 90g capacity is a sweet spot, allowing me to make up to 18 cups of coffee in one session. I’ve used it to prep my morning French press or grind a smaller batch for an espresso machine. What struck me immediately was how easy it is to use. With just an on/off button, there’s hardly any learning curve. Plus, the safety interlock ensures it won’t operate unless the lid is properly secured—a small but reassuring feature, especially when my nephew decided to “help” grind beans one morning.

Looking for Cuisinart DCG-12BC Coffee Grinder?[ Check Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/cuisinart-dcg-12bc-coffee-grinder-review-b0000a1zn7/)

Grinding performance is where this model shines and stumbles, depending on your expectations. The stainless steel blades are quick and efficient, producing fine grounds suited for drip coffee or a French press. However, if you’re seeking the precision of a burr grinder, especially for espresso, this may not be your go-to. I’ve tried grinding for a manual pour-over, and while it works in a pinch, it doesn’t produce the uniformity I’d prefer. That said, for an electric blade grinder, it’s reliable and delivers consistent results for most casual coffee drinkers.

The removable stainless steel bowl makes cleanup a breeze, especially since it’s dishwasher-safe. This feature is a lifesaver after those rushed mornings when I forget to clean it until later. Another thoughtful touch is the lid, which doubles as a storage option for leftover grounds. I’ve kept the lid on to save unused coffee for the next day, avoiding the hassle of transferring it to another container.

Speed isn’t something you’ll worry about with this grinder. It’s fast—perhaps too fast at times. The heavy-duty motor doesn’t mess around, and I’ve found myself needing to pulse instead of holding the button continuously to avoid over-grinding. It’s a minor adjustment, but worth mentioning.

**Pros**

* Compact and modern brushed stainless steel design.
* Easy to clean with a removable, dishwasher-safe bowl.
* Large capacity, enough for 18 cups in one grind.
* Simple one-button operation with safety features.
* Doubles as a spice grinder.

**Cons**

* Noisy during operation, which might wake up the house.
* Limited grind size precision compared to burr grinders.
* Motor can cause over-grinding if not pulsed carefully.
* Lid can feel a bit flimsy after multiple uses.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
When comparing the Cuisinart DCG-12BC to other electric blade grinders, it holds its own. Models like the KRUPS F203 are similarly priced and offer comparable features, but the Cuisinart edges ahead with its removable bowl for easy cleaning. However, if you’re willing to spend more, burr grinders like the Baratza Encore provide superior grind consistency, especially for espresso enthusiasts. The trade-off is the higher price and larger footprint, making the Cuisinart a better choice for those who prioritize simplicity and affordability.

Another alternative, the Hamilton Beach Fresh Grind, is quieter and slightly cheaper but lacks the capacity and sleek design of the DCG-12BC. While it’s a solid option for single-cup drinkers or minimalists, it doesn’t feel as robust or versatile.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
In terms of value, the Cuisinart DCG-12BC delivers more than what you’d expect at its price point. The combination of a durable motor, quality build, and thoughtful features like cord storage and a safety interlock makes it a practical choice for everyday use. While it won’t replace a high-end burr grinder, it serves its purpose well for casual coffee drinkers or those just starting to experiment with grinding their beans.

The added versatility of grinding spices is a bonus. I’ve used it for cumin and peppercorns, and it performed surprisingly well. It’s like getting two appliances in one, which enhances its value proposition. Considering its durability and ease of maintenance, this grinder is worth the investment for anyone content with blade grinding.

The Cuisinart DCG-12BC has become a staple in my kitchen. Despite its quirks, it has performed reliably and made my mornings easier. For those who want a simple, efficient, and stylish grinder without breaking the bank, this one is a solid contender.

I saw everyone else's beardies waking and worried over mine like the nervous wreck I am. Thankfully, someone shared their experience that was exactly like mine, and it helped put my mind at ease and not to let panic get the best of me.

This morning, good news, my beardie came out of his burrow! I was so happy to see him on his basking spot, looking like I do before my morning coffee. I turned his lights back on, aaaand, the basking bulb was out. It's the zoomed basking bulb that is getting really hard to find nowadays. I will pick up the arcadia golden sun basking bulb, same wattage, I hope it works at the same temperature as the zoomed one.

I gave him a mini basking bulb whilst I grab a new one and I plan to take him out for a bath after he warms up, to give him water. If he's still awake tomorrow, I will give him some greens.",2,1739038946.0,BeardedDragons,0,1.0,False

I was feeling quite energized yesterday, (i was home alone, and i'm often motivated to do things when no one else is around. Anyone else feel like that, or just me?) and I cleaned my whole bedroom and felt really good about it. 

Today, I realized I still have clothes in the dryer, and my bathroom is a mess. The thought of doing anything after all my hard work yesterday makes me nauseous. I just broke down in tears. 

How am I expected to live the rest of my life like this? I can only perform ""normally"" within random bursts of energy, and 98% of the time, I am completely frozen. I feel so defeated.

Plus, I'm currently trying to get a full-time job (in this economy? HA!) and it is the most draining experience of my life. I fight SO HARD to simply find positions I like and send out my application. Oh, and cover letters?? This shit is HARD, especially bc I don't actually really WANT any of these jobs, but I have to apply bc I know I need one. 

Then, after what feels like 1M applications, I get absolutely nowhere. Zero dopamine reward, or really any fucking reward for that matter. No one even sends rejection emails anymore. Just silence. And I'm expected to just keep doing this?? Writing cover letters and scouring job sites for HOURS for nothing in return? This process is actually so painful and excruciating for me. And all this so I can become a slave to capitalism forever?

I'm just feeling really defeated. Yes, I'm unmedicated, but all the meds I've tried barely worked for me, then my psychiatrist stopped taking my insurance, and well, yeah. I don't have the energy to start the process over considering all the meds I've tried were not much more effective than coffee. I'm exhausted.

I (65F) have been reading this sub since my diagnosis 4 years ago. I had some small flares but never needed the ER or hospital until this past December. I'm Canadian but wintering in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. I contracted Dengue Fever, triggering a bad diverticulitis flare. I was hospitalized for 3 days with IV antibiotics and sent home with Cipro/Flagyl for 10 days. I had to wait out the Dengue. I wasn't myself for 7 weeks.

Here's what has been working for me to keep my stomach happy and things moving. I haven’t found any food triggers but I can't get constipated.

I start the morning with warm water and fresh lime or lemon juice, followed by warm water with psyllium husk. Once I healed, I added coffee.

We know that the Omnitrix has DNA of a dolphin and a white laboratory rat.

What does this have to do with it?

Let’s imagine:

In a battle, Ben accidentally turns into a white dolphin/lab rat. The Omnitrix realizes that this transformation is inadequate for this fight, so he decides to change the genetic code of the transformation DNA, changing the Skeletal System, making his body more humanoid and less animalistic, and also improving the capabilities of the transformation, such as increased strength, speed, intelligence, resistance and agility. That’s why I have 4 questions for you:

1 - How strong, fast, intelligent, resistant and agile would this transformation be?

2- What alien transformations would be able to rival these transformations of the Earth?

3- What kind of clothes would they have?

4- Where would the Omnitrix symbol be located?

Another interesting thing is that the transformation of the white laboratory mouse could have both brown fur (Ben’s hair color) and the albino. After all, there are domestic rats with different colors and shades of hair, and this is very reminiscent of the Upchuck subspecies

1iktpig,https://www.reddit.com/r/wisdomteeth/comments/1iktpig/wisdom_teeth_recovery_weenie_edition/,Wisdom Teeth Recovery - Weenie Edition,"I had my top two wisdom teeth removed on 2/1 and now that I'm a week post-surgery I feel like it's a good time to give some advice! This is particularly true for my fellow weenies who are scared of this - because that's how I was pre-op and finding other people who understand the nerves is always a struggle! For a little background I'm 32f, this isn't my first medical rodeo, and I have a ton of dental trauma so I feel like saying I was terrified before hand is a bit of an understatement.

Pre-surgery:

I like Knowing so I did a ton of research on what to eat, what not to eat, and found some good menu suggestions beforehand. I stocked up on jellos and puddings, applesauce, meal replacement shakes, and yogurt and barely touched any of it haha. I mostly ate mashed potatoes (shout out to my mom) and thick, blended soups and a daily bowl of ice cream. I also knew I'd be on a week of rest (my surgeon said no dog walks, so he spent the week at his day camp) and stocked up on books and dvds from the library. I was terrified so I spent a lot of time crying also lol

Day of surgery:

It was scary and that's okay! Surgery is a big deal for anyone, me included, even if I've gone through 5 previous operations for different things. I was scared of the needle going in for sedation and asked for laughing gas which they gave me and it works wonders. For anyone wondering, laughing gas makes you feel high as a kite but you won't do or say anything out of pocket. It's more to relax you and make the scary parts easier! I recommend it for anyone who is afraid, it's better to do the things that makes this easier for YOU than to tough it out for no reason. They put the needle in and like two minutes later I was out. I woke up and the only thing I remember was trying to go back to sleep after haha. I didn't do or say anything weird or loopy, all I did was texted a few friends that I'd survived my surgery and looked like a chipmunk due to the gauze.

I spent the day resting on the couch with Netflix on, doing nothing but recuperating. You (and I) just underwent surgery, so rest is key! Milk it for ALL IT'S WORTH if you can! Rest is very important for healing and you don't want to do anything more than walking to the bathroom the 24 hours after surgery. Pro tip: bite down HARD on the gauze in order to form a clot. Like someone is trying to take the damn thing from you and you can't do anything else to keep them from doing that. I bled for hours after surgery until my mom (bless her) spoke to my surgeon and said I wasn't trying hard enough (yeah, his bedside manner is atrocious but he did a good job).

Day 1 & 2 post-op:

These were the hardest and, I don't mean to brag, but even they weren't so bad. It might be just because I had the top two removed and my expectations for recovery were in the toilet, but my pain levels were manageable. I recovered just by taking ibuprofen and some tylenol. I had been prescribed a painkiller but haven't touched it. I was also given an antibiotic to take with food. The worst part about the days immediately after surgery was that I wasn't sleeping. At all. I couldn't get comfortable as a side sleeper and every time I laid down something would be uncomfortable. So the first two nights I only managed about 3 hours of sleep which isn't ideal. But since my only job was to sit in bed and be lazy, it wasn't so bad! I iced my face a LOT to combat swelling - which, leads me to a pro tip: invest in packs that can be frozen on those first days and then microwaved for heat for the next few. After 48 hours the ice doesn't help the swelling anymore and the heat helps relax the jaw and makes a world of difference. Trust me, you're going to want at least one of these but ideally two for recovery. We got mine from the Dollar Tree here in the US and I would have been worse off had I not had anything like this. Definitely grab if you can!

Day 3-present:

I switched to heat on the third day (Tuesday) after surgery and, my god, it made such a difference in terms of immediate relief. I hate being in pain (does anyone love it? No, but I do anything to avoid it) so that + ibuprofen really kept me from going over the edge. 20 minutes on switching back and forth and then repeat an hour or so later. This also made things like brushing my teeth easier, as it was difficult to get the brush in between my jaws difficult (even using a kid toothbrush, I have a small mouth). At this time I also called my surgeon asking if I could have coffee because 4 days without it was hard! They said yes, just no straws, which I've been avoiding fully since Saturday. So if you have any questions, call your doctor! They know you and your mouth which makes their personalized answers in that way so key.

Pro tips:   
  
1. buy a tongue scraper, especially if you're on an antibiotic. It's gross but you'll feel so much better.  
2. buy a small thing of salt to keep in your bathroom, along with a few disposable cups. Having a small station to do salt water rinses 3/4 times a day makes wanting to do it easier. I also recommend keeping some tissues nearby if you don't already because you can't spit and it makes the string of saliva dangly  
3. Sleep might be hard to come by if you're like me. Try to take it as easy as you can during those first few days, find a good show to binge on Netflix or treat yourself to a cozy video game. Having something to take your mind off of the recovery really helps!  
4. Hydrate! You won't be eating your typical caloric intake but keeping up with water is something easy to do that'll help recovery and help you feel better faster. That being said, my lips have been SO dry so also get a favorite chapstick or tub of vaseline to help feel better!  
5. Be careful while driving the first time post-op. I thought I'd be fine yesterday but I was struggling more than I thought I would.

So, yeah, that's my recovery life! I hope this helps a little. It's scary but if I can do it with my PTSD and trauma, I promise you that you can too! This was the scariest thing I've ever done, my true biggest fear, and I'm here on the other side to tell the tale.",3,1739038635.0,wisdomteeth,0,1.0,False

I always try to do something new each trip and take a casual approach. We only do Standby lines. For me, this was a trip to hang out with our cousin (also AP).

**Thursday- 2/5/25 (Steps - 18,108) Good To Go Day for APs**

* 7:00 am - Secured Virtual Queue (VQ) for Cosmic Rewind (CR), group 17  with callback estimated in 135 minutes.
* 8:40 am- Just my brother and I on the road from our cousin’s house in Titusville. 
* 8:50 am- Called back (no pressure).
* 9:58 am - Scanned into CR and we were in the final line for the ride by 10:30 am. Our song was “I Ran” which was a first for both of us! Now we just need “One Way or Another”. I love the song “I Ran”, but of the 5 I have gotten so far, it goes least with the ride and is too slow or at least not timed well.
* 10:54 am - New passholder magnet (Ray from Princess and the Frog)
* 11ish am -  Wandered around to look at the Festival of the Arts (aka FArts), saw the 30 Years of Disney on Broadway exhibit in Communicore, enjoyed the chalk sidewalk drawings, and some of the art booths and wandered to France. I had never been to FArts before.
* We saw a bridal party leaving EPCOT near France/Port of Entry! It looked like they had a ceremony and/or reception right on the water in front of France. I wonder how much that costs?
* 11:30 am - Les Halles for Quiche Lorraine and the strongest coffee in EPCOT! It was not busy and the line was the shortest I had ever seen; well inside the main ordering area. We even snagged a table for 4. While we were eating, I heard someone ask to sit with us and replied ”yes” without even looking up. A nice couple, retired military from Missouri, sat at our table and we chatted. They were staying at Shades of Green.
* 12:00 pm - Single Rider line for Remy, we were both done by 12:12 pm! I don’t remember the Standby wait, but I know it was over 30 minutes because that is our general threshold. 
* 1:13 pm - In our room at the Coronado, which was ready early! We were in Casitas (we kept jokingly calling it Carnitas) on the ground floor, building 5 facing the courtyard. We could see part of a bridge and not much else, I was happy we weren’t facing the parking lot.  We have stayed here before in the Cabanas and I prefer that section to this one. I like the grounds and general vibe no matter where we stay.
* 2:21 pm - At Hollywood Studios and in line for Single Rider for Rise of the Resistance because my cousin and partner got there before us and they were already halfway through the Standby line (Posted wait 55 minutes). We figured this way they wouldn’t have to wait for us, instead we waited for them. Single Rider is not the thing to do if you have never ridden it before, because you should see the whole pre-show and start of the ride. For us it was great because we have ridden many times and this was the first time doing Single Rider and it was cool to see behind the scenes areas. My group’s interrogator Zach was great! (Left a compliment). I would also like to note that we got A mode Kylo!!
* 2:47 pm - My brother and I were off of Rise, by 3:02 pm - Cousin & partner were off of Rise.
* 3:05 pm - Standby line for all 4 of us for Smugglers Run with a posted wait of 30 minutes, by 3:29 pm - we were in the pre-show area. The four of us got our own ship and my brother and I were pilots.
* 4:15 pm - Standby Line for Tower of Terror with a posted wait of 30 minutes and by 4:40 pm we were loading into the elevator.
* Afterwards we chilled near Fairfax Fare. 
* 6:00 pm walk up list for Three Bridges. My cousin had trouble getting through the gate to park and meet us for dinner, which was ridiculous because it wasn’t crowded. He was less than pleased as he is not a fan of eating at the resorts because of the hassle. He also got bit by mosquitoes on the way to the restaurant, and the staff at the front were weird about letting them in even though I said we were waiting for them and pointed out that they were walking over. My cousin was not a happy camper. I wanted to eat there because I had never eaten there before. Our waiter (Simo) was very knowledgeable about the menu and accommodating (Cast compliment). He recommended the roasted corn dip which did not disappoint. I had the pork carnitas (in honor of our accommodations ;-) and would recommend them. The Tres Leches was weird and I only had a bite or two. Overall I enjoyed Three Bridges, but it may be a “one and done”. 
* 8:30 pm - In bed after walking around the resort. I was exhausted and wanted to relax and read. Unfortunately some indigestion and noisy cheerleaders foiled that plan. To be fair, they did seem to quiet down by 11:30 pm, so we didn’t bother complaining.

**Friday- 2/6/25 (Steps- 9,045)** 

* 7:00 am - Secured VQ for CR, group 20 with callback estimated in 150 minutes.
* 9:13 am - Checked my phone as we got in the car to head to EPCOT and our group had been called. We saw a team of cheerleaders practicing in the parking lot. :-)
* 9:45 am - Scanned into CR. There was no line and we waited briefly before going into the first loading room. By 10:05 am we were in the main loading area. We got Conga, which is not one of my personal favorite songs, but I think it goes very well with the ride.
* 10:50 am - Iced mocha coffee from the Joffrey's stand at American Adventure and then headed over to The Artist’s Table for the Deviled Egg Trio which was small, but good. It was quiet and we had a picnic table to ourselves. 
* 11:30 am - Split a Raspberry Pastry at Figment’s Inspiration Station at the Odyssey. It was a Bougie Pop Tart, would eat again. 
* 12ish pm - Left EPCOT to drive home.

**Observations**

* Cast Members were friendly, helpful, and upbeat with two compliment worthy interactions. There was one female cast member at the EPCOT parking tollbooth on the first day who said “have a nice day” in the slowest, saddest voice, so we kept saying it to each other that way and made an in-joke about it. 
* Overall the other attendees were polite, my cousin uses a walker and people were mindful of letting him through and not cutting him off. I observed another guest pick up garbage that a guest in front of them dropped on the ground. A kind man walking with his family stopped and offered to take a picture of the 4 of us at the Coronado when we were clearly having selfie issues.
* Technically there was a call out the first time we rode CR, but it was a very small child who said “EPCOT” randomly, so it was kind of adorable. The second time there were no call outs. Both times people veered toward the doors, but a good majority stayed toward the middle to watch the show. I could tell by reactions that there were a lot of first timers.

1iktl9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1iktl9x/glofx_green_therapy_glasses_review_model/,GloFX Green Therapy Glasses review model B073PLF8KH: migraine relief and mood-boosting lenses,"Every morning, I’ve been slipping on these GloFX Green Therapy Glasses, and honestly, they've become a unique part of my daily routine. The concept of chromotherapy intrigued me initially, but I didn't expect these glasses to have such a noticeable effect on my migraines and overall mood. While they aren't a magical cure-all, they certainly made a difference, and their design and functionality deserve some attention.

**Design & Build Quality**  
The glasses are lightweight yet sturdy, constructed with PVC frames and stainless steel hinges. They’re not flimsy, but they’re also not overly bulky, which is a win in my book. The scratch-resistant green lenses are a nice touch; I’ve accidentally dropped them a couple of times, and they survived without a mark. They’ve got a sleek aesthetic, even if the green tint might make you look a little like a sci-fi character. Still, I'd rather look futuristic than deal with migraines all day.

**Light Intensity & Settings**  
These glasses don’t emit light themselves; they’re designed to filter light into the green spectrum, which is said to help with pain relief and relaxation. Wearing them for about 20 minutes, especially during a migraine, reduced the intensity of my headache. It’s almost like stepping into a calming filter for the world around me. The green hue is soothing, but it might not work for everyone. My co-worker tried them out and said they just made her feel like she was underwater. Different strokes, I guess.

[Check GloFX Green Therapy Glasses price on Amazon.](https://agegene.com/product/glofx-green-therapy-glasses-review-model-b073plf8kh/)

**Color Temperature & Spectrum**  
The green tint supposedly signals the brain to calm down and suppress pain. While I can’t speak to the exact science, I have noticed that staring at screens or harsh lights is less irritating when I wear these. The chromotherapy claim seems legitimate, but it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. My cousin, who deals with intense light sensitivity, didn’t find them as effective as I did.

**Ease of Use**  
These glasses are refreshingly simple. There’s no need to fiddle with buttons, timers, or settings. You just put them on and let the lenses do their thing. However, I wouldn’t recommend wearing them for long periods, as the tint can distort natural colors. For example, I mistakenly poured orange juice into my coffee one morning because everything looked green. Whoops.

**Portability & Size**  
Compact and lightweight, they’re easy to toss into a bag without taking up much space. I’ve brought them to work, the gym, and even on a road trip. Still, I’d suggest using a protective case to avoid scratching the lenses if you’re as clumsy as I am.

**Safety & Eye Comfort**  
The GloFX glasses are UV-protected and flicker-free, which is a huge bonus. I didn’t experience any discomfort or strain while wearing them, even during migraines. However, they do alter your perception of colors, which can be disorienting at first. Definitely don’t wear them while driving—I learned this the hard way when I struggled to distinguish traffic lights.

**Pros**

* Lightweight and durable design.
* Noticeable migraine relief and relaxation effects.
* Simple to use with no complicated settings.
* Compact and portable for on-the-go use.
* UV protection and flicker-free lenses.

**Cons**

* Distorts colors, making tasks like cooking or driving tricky.
* Effectiveness varies; not everyone finds relief.
* Green tint might not suit all preferences or needs.
* No carrying case included.
* Limited impact on severe light sensitivity.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
I’ve tried similar products like Axon Optics’ migraine glasses, which are more focused on light sensitivity. While Axon’s lenses are great for filtering out blue light, they didn’t have the same calming effect as the GloFX glasses. On the other hand, TheraSpecs glasses excel in medical certifications but lack the stylish design and portability of GloFX. The GloFX Green Therapy Glasses stand out for their unique chromotherapy approach, but they don’t entirely replace specialized migraine glasses tailored for severe photophobia.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Considering their build quality and the niche benefits of green light therapy, I’d say the GloFX glasses are fairly priced. They’re not the cheapest option, but they offer a unique feature set that justifies the investment for those dealing with chronic migraines or looking for a mood boost. That said, if your main concern is light sensitivity, other products might offer better value.

**Features in Action**  
The glasses are marketed as a tool for reducing migraines, light sensitivity, and even chronic pain. I tested them over several weeks, wearing them during migraines, after long workdays, and while facing bright computer screens. Their effectiveness was most noticeable during migraines; within 15-20 minutes, the head-splitting pain eased into a manageable dull ache. However, their impact on chronic pain, like my friend’s back issues, was less pronounced. They’re also touted for mood enhancement, which I did notice subtly—everything feels a bit more grounded and serene when viewed through the green lens.
