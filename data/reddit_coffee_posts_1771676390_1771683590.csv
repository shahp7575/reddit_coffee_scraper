1ras8dp,https://i.redd.it/ttls0q2pwukg1.jpeg,My cat is sick and at the vet and I have to take a teaching content test,"Ft. oatmeal with pecans, OJ and cranberry juice, and a hazelnut coffee.

I’m really upset. Yesterday around 3 a.m., my cat started vomiting. I thought it was just a hairball, cleaned it up, and went back to sleep. When I woke up at 5:30 for work, he was vomiting again, and I assumed he still hadn’t passed it. When I got home around 3, I found more vomit around the house, and he threw up again right in front of me.

I took him to the emergency vet. He had a 104 fever. His radiology looks good and his vitals are normal, and the last time I called they said his fever was down to 103. But he’s refusing to eat, and I honestly can’t imagine functioning without him. There have been so many times when him just sitting on my lap and purring gave me strength when I had none.

On top of all that, I have to take my 7 to 12 social studies teacher content test this morning. I need an 80 to pass. I got an 83 on the practice test before studying, and after a few weeks of review I’ve been scoring between 97 and 99. Still, the margin for error feels small, and I’m so worried about my baby that I’m scared I won’t pass.",1,1771683514.0,GirlDinnerDiaries,0,1.0,False

Age 31

Height 174 cm tall enough to reach the top shelf

Religion Hindu

Mother Tongue Hindi

Education BTech

Occupation Engineer I can fix WiFi, reboot systems, and confidently say have you tried turning it off and on again before calling customer care

Diet Loyal to paneer, emotionally attached to coffee and bagel, occasionally flirts with omelettes

Marital Status: Never Married

# More About Me

I am simple and not materialistic. For me love means time, effort, loyalty, and showing up consistently, not expensive gifts or once a year social media declarations.

I am ambitious and career focused, but I also know how to switch off and relax. I can go from discussing long term goals to debating which café has the best coffee and ambience in under a minute. I enjoy traveling and exploring new places, though I will absolutely over plan the itinerary and still say let us just go with the flow.

Family and culture are important to me. I am spiritual, grateful, and grounded. I believe in growing constantly financially, emotionally, and spiritually. Caste and income do not matter to me, mindset and values do. Money grows with skills and hard work, character stays.

I am equally happy with cozy nights at home watching something random or planning a spontaneous weekend trip we will laugh about later. I believe relationships are teamwork, not ego battles.

# Fun facts

I will offer you the last slice of pizza unless it has paneer toppings, then we discuss

Coffee and bagel mornings are sacred and this is a lifelong commitment

I might act logical, but I am actually a softie

I will hype you up before presentations like your personal PR manager

I will pretend I do not care which café we go to but secretly I have already checked the ratings

# Partner Preferences

Age 24 to 31, 31 plus welcome

Religion Hindu

Education At least a Bachelor’s degree

Occupation Any, bonus points if you understand finance or can explain taxes patiently

Diet No preference, just do not judge my paneer loyalty or my serious relationship with coffee

# What I Am Looking For

A mature, driven partner who can push me beyond my limits, my best friend, biggest supporter, and adventure buddy. Someone who laughs at simple jokes, communicates honestly, and believes in building a life together step by step.

If you believe love is built in everyday moments, shared coffee, shared goals, shared laughter, we will get along just fine.

1ras6im,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ras6im/feeling_really_confused_after_things_suddenly/,Feeling really confused after things suddenly ended with a girl would love some perspective,"hi , man 23 here, i need help on this one,

I went out on dates with this girl 4 times (1 date per week) recently and the vibe was honestly great. Every time we met, we’d talk for hours. It felt really natural and easy. I made her laugh a lot and there was a real sense of connection.

Even people around us noticed. Some friends told me she seemed really into me , not just casually. At parties she’d often ask where I was, wanted me to come say goodbye before leaving, and would come talk to me even if she was in the middle of another conversation. It genuinely felt like something was building.

The only context is that she broke up with her ex 2 months ago, so fairly recently.

Last Saturday we were at a party together and got a lot closer physically. Nothing crazy (we didn’t even kiss, i knew her situation so i wanted to take things slowly), but we were very close, very in sync. The night went really well. Last week she even suggested I come over for dinner at her place and a movie another day. So in my head, things were clearly moving in a good direction.

Then this week we grabbed a coffee, and she told me that she woke up one morning feeling like things were going too fast. She said that even though she really likes me and we get along super well, she thinks we should stop here. She told me she still thinks a lot about her ex and isn’t ready. She also told me that even though i wasnt putting any pressure on the situation she felt that if we continued she would automatically put pressure on herself.

i told her i fully understood, and now ill just back off to respect her mindset of course.

Now I just feel really confused. Everything felt sincere and natural, and then it just stopped out of nowhere. I’m trying to figure out whether:

• it really is just bad timing / her ex

• she got scared of things becoming serious

\- also should i expect maybe a comback in the upcoming weeks, or is it over ?

1ras3fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheKoernerOffice/comments/1ras3fu/these_sunglasses_are_made_from_coffee_grounds/,"These sunglasses are made from coffee grounds that 100,000 coffee shops pay you to haul away daily","https://reddit.com/link/1ras3fu/video/tb5iu7o3vukg1/player

People often buy because they love the story.   
  
We're buying stories not products.  
  
These are sunglasses, but they're not made from plastic or metal. They're made from something that you can get paid to take.   
  
Not something that you pay for, something that you get paid to take for free.   
  
And the more you think about it, the more genius it becomes.   
  
How many coffee shops are there in the world? Over 100,000.   
  
What percentage of them throw away their coffee grounds every day? Like 98%.   
  
It's just a waste. It goes in the landfills. Nobody wants it.   
  
But someone looked at that waste and thought, what if that's not waste? What if this is raw material?   
  
And that change in perspective changes everything.  
  
Now you've got a product that costs you nothing to source. It's called a negative COGS business (cost of goods sold).   
  
A negative COGS business is where you actually get paid to take the material you make your product out of.   
  
A company called Eco Scraps did this in Utah.   
  
They got paid to take old produce from grocery stores and they turned it into luxury compost that they sold at Home Depot for nine bucks a bag instead of three bucks a bag.   
  
These guys are doing the same thing with coffee grounds but they're turning it into sunglasses of all things.   
  
Brilliant story.  
Brilliant execution.  
  
I freaking love this stuff.

I need to get this off my chest because it’s been eating at me for a while, and I know I’m not the only one feeling this way.
You pour your heart into your art. Late nights, endless revisions, commissions that finally start coming in (even if they’re small at first). You share your sales proudly – “Hey, I sold a piece today!” – thinking maybe, just maybe, your family will see that you’re serious, that this passion is turning into something real.
And then you hear:
“Ah bravo, with that money you can buy yourself a lunch 😂”
Or “Nice, one coffee paid for!”
Or just straight-up laughter, like it’s all a cute little hobby that doesn’t count.
It hurts. A lot.
Because it’s from the people who are supposed to be your biggest supporters 😂. They see the dollars but not the years of doubt, the skill building, the emotional labor behind every piece of art. They reduce your wins to pocket change jokes, and it makes you question if you’re delusional for believing in this path.
I’m not asking for them to fund my life or pretend I’m the next big thing. I just want basic respect for what I do – the same respect they’d give if I was grinding at a “real” job. Instead, it feels like no matter how much I sell or improve, it’ll always be “just doing images” to them.
So… am I alone in this?
do your family/parents/relatives do the same? Mock your earnings? Downplay your passion? Tell you to “get a real job” even when you’re making money from art?
Or did you manage to change their minds over time? How?
Please share in the comments – your stories, your rants, your advice. Even a simple “Same here 😔” would mean the world right now. Knowing we’re not solo in this frustration helps more than you think.
If you’re reading this and your family does support you fully… you’re lucky. Hold onto that gratitude, and maybe drop a kind word to someone who doesn’t have it.
Thanks for listening.

1ras0g2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ras0g2/ms_between_every_breath/,[MS] Between every breath,"Read carefully, every breath matters. 

\_\_\_

The city smelled of rain and asphalt. He walked down the street, his steps echoing in puddles that weren’t there before. The people around him moved normally, laughing, talking, yet he felt them somehow wrong, like they were watching versions of him he didn’t recognize.

He took a breath.

And something inside him shifted.

Across the street, a man waved. But it wasn’t a man. It was him - slightly older, eyes sharper, smirk crueler. Another version stepped into view from an alley, whispering numbers he didn’t understand.

He realized, with a cold surge, what was happening. Every inhale, every exhale, somewhere in the world - or perhaps inside him - a new consciousness had awakened. Another self, fully aware, fully alive, claiming space he had never given it.

“Choose,” one said, voice sharp as glass.  
“Choose who will exist today.”

He tried to run, but every step split him further. Each version clawed at him, pulling, shouting, crying.  
“I remember better than you!”  
“I am the real one!”  
“You cannot leave me behind!”  
“I will survive if you fail!”

He stopped at a crosswalk. People walked by, oblivious. He wanted to scream, but his own mouth was full of voices not his own. Each inhalation birthed another consciousness; each exhalation left fragments of himself behind, echoing, screaming, moving without him. He sank to his knees, pressing his palms against his temples.

The city dissolved around him. Buildings shimmered. Signs twisted. Every billboard, every reflection, every puddle showed him: smiling, screaming, pleading, laughing. The more he struggled, the more of them appeared. His mind teetered on the edge of comprehension and madness.

A version knelt in front of him. Its eyes were soft, familiar. “You can end it,” it whispered. “Just let me step in.”

He shook his head. “No, I… I won’t surrender.”

Another version screamed from the sidewalk. “We’re dying! Every breath! Every second!”

Time stretched and twisted. Minutes became hours. Hours became decades. He could feel his heart breaking into fragments, each fragment inhabited by a version of himself arguing, fighting, pleading for life, recognition, supremacy.

He tried to remember normality. He remembered breakfast yesterday, the coffee he had spilled, the sound of a friend’s laugh on the phone. Tiny details, each of them anchoring him - but even those memories were not safe. In one reflection, the friend’s laugh was mocking; in another, it was accusing. Every memory was another echo, bending and reshaping with each breath.

He stumbled into an alley, hoping for isolation. Instead, it was full. Hundreds of versions crowded the narrow space, each pressing closer, mouths moving, hands reaching. He covered his ears, but the whispers penetrated. The air was thick with his own presence, each self fighting to exist.

Finally, he saw it: a bridge across the river, sunlight spilling over it, warm and real. Relief blossomed. He sprinted toward it. A dozen versions leaped, one grabbing his arm, another pulling at his shoulder. “Stop!”    
“Go!”    
“Only one can survive!”    
  
He lunged forward, breaking free. Sunlight hit his face. For a heartbeat, everything seemed normal. Birds sang. Children laughed. Cars passed. He inhaled deeply, thinking he had escaped.    
  
Then he felt it - the tug in his chest. Another self, born from a breath he hadn’t noticed, clung to him. Another. And another. They multiplied with each inhalation, and their whispers grew, layering, intertwining, never ceasing.    
  
He stumbled to a puddle, staring at his reflection.

Hundreds of faces stared back: laughing, screaming, crying. He tried to run, to breathe normally, to escape. But every step forward birthed more versions. Every heartbeat split him further. Every choice he made, every hesitation, every breath, created echoes of himself that were alive, aware, watching.  

The city moved on.

And in every echo, every shadow, every breath: he was never alone. He never will be.

\---

Every breath you take carries a thousand versions of yourself. And they are all awake, watching, and waiting. ",1,1771682925.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

You can still feel the metallic taste on the tip of your tongue—that taste very few of us are used to. While it’s true I had some experience, as it had been nearly five years since I graduated from the police academy, during that time we handled various distress calls sent to the base.



​The night shift is intriguing, even filled with suspense; there’s no doubt this job is dangerous at any hour, for as the saying goes, crime never sleeps. But when the sun goes down and night blankets the city, between bizarre shadows and mocking laughter, all kinds of spectacles unfold: fights in filthy alleys, drunks making a scene in public, domestic disputes... many began with the phrase ""Daddy is hitting Mommy"" and ended with a grieving mother.



​Thieves slipping through the shadows to commit their crimes; if the victim was lucky, we’d assist before tragedy struck. These days, I don’t know what the hell is wrong with people: some blame the government for failing to provide, others blame parents for not raising the child to avoid punishing the adult.



​In reality, everyone is a victim of their own mistakes, and circumstances often play a major role; sometimes collateral damage triggers a whirlwind of emotions that form a circle of tragedies. Despite it all, through days, weeks, and years, my partner and I patrolled every night with the same recurring mysteries, falling into a routine that was quite practical and, if I dare say, even boring.
​But that rainy night in August would change our lives forever.



​It all began like any other shift. The alarm went off at 7 p.m.; five years of the same routine meant a single beep was enough to put me on alert. I turned on the shower; as I did, the delicious aroma of pasta flooded my nostrils. I let my sense of smell guide me toward the source.



​I left the room without hesitation, bewitched by the scent of tomato sauce and Italian herbs. In an instant, I was in front of the oven, where that delicacy rested, giving off warm, soft notes. I looked around to make sure no one was watching, but before I could reach for the handle, a voice behind me made me jump.




​""Don't you even think about opening that oven,"" she exclaimed, then added: ""I think I’ll have to arrest you.""



​It was the sweetest voice in the world. Viviana, my wife. We had been married for four years but had known each other since high school. We didn’t have children yet; she was still finishing her studies, and we had agreed to wait until we both had stable jobs.



​""What am I being charged with, officer?"" I replied with a smirk.



​""Trespassing in the kitchen and attempted theft,"" she said, walking slowly toward me. Before I could say a word, she silenced me with her kisses.



​There’s no doubt that from the moment I met her, I knew she was the perfect woman. Her lips sparked the same sensation as our first kiss; I don't know if it was that strawberry-flavored lipstick or simply the love we felt. I began to run my fingertips up her back beneath her blouse, feeling every fold of her skin until I slowly reached her waist. I could feel her ragged breath; how her skin prickled as my lips began to devour her long, smooth neck.



​Just as we were about to merge our bodies into one, as if it were a cruel joke, the oven timer went off.



​""The pasta!"" she cried out, pushing me aside. ""Honey, you left the shower running and you’re going to be late.""



​Putting on her oven mitts, she gave me one last kiss as she pulled out the tray.



​""Dinner is ready.""



​Minutes after a hot shower, I was tasting the last bite. I gathered my things and prepared to leave, not without saying goodbye with a kiss; she wished me a quiet shift so I could return home.



​I left in a hurry. As I headed to the car, I noticed dark clouds covering the sky, which was drowning in the twilight. Within minutes, I was at the station, greeting colleagues finishing their shifts and those starting with me.



​In the locker room, I hurried to fix my uniform when I noticed my partner’s absence. I was staring at the void of his lonely locker when I was interrupted.



​""Officer Roberto Solís called in sick,"" I heard a familiar voice. Before I could react, it added: ""Santoyo will be riding with you tonight, Officer Muñiz.""



​It was Captain Mendoza. Rogelio Mendoza had a short career, coming from a long family tradition. It took him only two years to leave the gritty streets and become a homicide detective—a fast promotion, though many felt it was unearned. Before his detractors could even process it, he took over the captaincy. Many thought it was the Mendoza genes, but in twelve years in charge, there have been more inconsistencies than results.



​His inefficiency and arrogance moved him away from his long-awaited goal. The new commissioner arrived as a transfer from a neighboring state: a direct blow to his ego. We were in the briefing room listening to the orders.



​""Alright, gentlemen. We’ve been informed of a group of youths vandalizing the mall, specifically the loading docks. Kids between seventeen and nineteen with skateboards, spray cans, and apparently, illegal substances. Act with caution. There are no reports of weapons, but kids are crazy these days; take extreme precautions.""



​Silence filled the room.



​""Last point,"" he continued. ""Neighbors claim the old hospital has been overrun by addicts and is functioning as a dealing spot. Sector H, patrolled by Muñiz and Officer Santoyo. Same recommendations: take extreme precautions. Most of these junkies are capable of killing for a dose. Don't let your guard down.""



​Without further questions, we boarded patrol car 1077. The rain began to fall, and within minutes, a downpour flooded the deserted streets. We patrolled for a couple of hours in a silence broken only by the dispatcher reporting blackouts. I enjoyed the sound of the rain and the comfortable silence. Past midnight, the storm turned into a steady drizzle; enough to justify a stop.



​""Large Americano with one cream,"" I told Santoyo as he crossed the parking lot.



​I took the chance to message Roberto Solís: ""What happened, brother? Everything okay?""


 I watched the screen, but there was no reply. I considered calling, but given the hour, I let it go. Santoyo reappeared, and the delicious aroma of freshly roasted coffee filled the car.



​""Damn rain,"" he muttered. ""The girl inside says it’s going to keep up all night.""



​""Yeah, it’s going to be a wet one,"" I replied.
​We continued patrolling the cold, wet pavement, sharing stories and jokes. The laughter died down when the early morning silence was shattered by an emergency call:



​""Attention, a fight is reported near the hospital. Suspects are a male and a female who apparently wounded the victim with a blade.""



​Santoyo responded as the car accelerated and the sirens broke the peace of the asphalt jungle.


​""Patrol 1077 en route. We are within the perimeter, a few blocks away on Fifth and Magistrados. Over.""



​""Copy. Use extreme caution, suspects are armed and dangerous. Repeat: suspects are armed and dangerous,"" the dispatcher concluded.



​I shifted into third and accelerated. My heart was racing, my mouth felt dry. I looked over at Santoyo and noticed his nervousness.



​""Everything okay?""



​""Yeah... it’s just, I’ve been on the force for nine months and the only time I’ve drawn my weapon was to clean it. I haven’t even been to the range since the academy. I was in monitoring when I asked Captain Mendoza if I could help with anything else. He assigned me to you until Solís returns.""



​I realized I had two problems: a pair of potentially drugged attackers and, on the other hand, the ""camera guy"" who hadn't fired a shot in a year.


​""Keep your eyes peeled. If you make eye contact, keep your distance. Most importantly: you fire only if your life is at risk.""



​He nodded, the nervousness evident in his eyes.



​""People high on drugs with a weapon are capable of killing without a second thought,"" I continued, ""but if we handle this right, nobody has to get hurt.""



​We turned toward the hospital. The sky was falling apart; it was impossible to see through the deluge. Still, as we got closer, we spotted a silhouette in the storm. It was running toward us. Realizing we were there, the figure stopped dead and, with surprising agility, scaled the fence.

I've spent 12 years as a vending machine technician working on coffee, snack, and drink machines across Italy. I've seen hundreds of businesses succeed (and fail) with vending operations.

I mostly work on the technical side (fixing machines, troubleshooting errors, maintenance), but I've learned a lot about the business aspects:

\- Which machines are most reliable for different locations

\- Common mistakes when buying used equipment  

\- Maintenance costs vs. revenue expectations

\- What to look for in vending contracts

\- When DIY repairs make sense vs. calling a tech

Happy to answer any questions about vending as a business or side hustle! Whether you're thinking of starting, already operating machines, or just curious.

Why?,"Recently, I passed by a **Nespresso** kiosk inside the mall again, and they offered me the new limited flavor **White Chocolate & Strawberry**. The staff recognized me, so they let me try it first to see if I’d like it.

While it was brewing in front of me using a Vertuo machine, it honestly smelled like **Black Forest cake**. It smelled amazing. They also asked if I wanted it with milk. I said yes. Then I remembered that the milk they usually recommend and use in-store is **Emborg Full Cream Milk**.

I liked the aroma and taste, so I ended up buying Emborg Full Cream Milk at the grocery.

I’m just curious. Is Emborg Full Cream Milk recommended in Nespresso stores only here in my country, or is it also recommended where you are? Do your local stores also offer free tastings?

For those with more knowledge, *why do you think Nespresso stores here recommend Emborg Full Cream Milk specifically?*

Also, while I was grocery shopping, I noticed there are other types of Emborg milk aside from Full Cream Milk. There’s **Skimmed Fresh Milk**, **Low Fat Fresh Milk**, and I also saw on their website that they have an **Organic Full Cream Milk**.

What are the differences between these?

Which one pairs best with Nespresso capsules?

Which works better for hot coffee vs iced coffee?

Do they taste noticeably different?

Do they behave differently when using a milk frother?

If it were up to you, what milk would you personally recommend? The kind you kept switching around before but eventually stuck with because it tasted the best for you.

I’ll probably experiment more once I finish this Emborg Full Cream Milk.

Just want to get some advice when it comes to burning urethra after peeing. It's my only symptom, I have elevated RBCs and some small kidney sand in kidneys on last ultrasound two months ago (it didn't cause trouble at the time). For the past month I've been struggling with the urethra stuff and over a week ago the doctor finally diagnosed me based on tests and symptoms. I'm taking some prescribed pills to help with flushing out for now. I'm currently trying (but struggling) to modify my diet, eat less salt, processed food, meat and drink less coffee/tea/soda. But still experiencing burning, worse or less on particular days or time of the day. It often gets exacerbated in the evening/at night even though I drink a lot beforehand.
Anyone here had kidney sand and was able to flush it out before it turned into stones? Any tips on the burning?",1,1771682347.0,KidneyStones,2,1.0,False

I’m dealing with a situation I’ve never experienced before and would really appreciate your advice.

I recently hosted guests (they were polite and there were no other issues), but something happened that I honestly never imagined could occur: they made coffee without lifting the glass lid of the stove — they turned on the burner with the lid closed and placed the pot directly on top of the glass.

In Brazil, this type of glass lid is extremely common on stoves and is clearly not meant to be used as a cooking surface. The guest who booked the stay has been living in Brazil for about a year and has stayed in other Airbnbs here, so it’s not a case of someone unfamiliar with local appliances.

Luckily, I noticed in time and was able to stop it before the glass shattered. However, it still caused damage: the rubber seal on the side melted and there is now a burn mark.

The stove is practically brand new, still under warranty, and I purchased it recently partly for aesthetic reasons, so I’m quite upset.

I contacted Airbnb the same day. They advised me to document everything and obtain a repair estimate; they said they would request payment from the guests, and if the guests do not pay, Airbnb may cover the cost.

I have contacted the manufacturer’s authorized service and am waiting for the estimate. I will also check whether the warranty might cover this, although I have doubts since this type of damage will likely be considered misuse — especially given how unusual the situation is.

I have not reviewed the guests yet because I’m concerned about how this might affect my own rating. They stayed until the end of the reservation and are aware of what happened. The stove still works, but the cosmetic damage bothers me a lot, and I don’t feel I should bear the cost.

Has anyone experienced something similar?

How would you handle this situation?

Is it better to try the warranty first or go directly through Airbnb’s resolution process?

And regarding the review — should I wait until everything is resolved?

Thank you in advance for any guidance.",2,1771682321.0,airbnb_hosts,3,1.0,False

• Registered nurse currently surviving OR culture shock

• Coffee girl. Hot white chocolate mocha has my whole heart

• Into baking, singing randomly, and late night thoughts

• Soft for slow burn connections and emotionally intelligent men

• Can rant about hospital chaos but will absolutely listen to yours too

Maybe I’ll quit OR. Maybe I’ll stay and grow from it. Maybe I just need someone nice to talk to tonight so I don’t spiral alone.

i didnt check analytics for a few days because honestly i expected nothing

came back and saw $487 sitting there. in one week. from content i already made months ago

its not life changing money i know that. but the fact that it came from videos i filmed ages ago and basically forgot about.. that part got me. like i was leaving money on the table the whole time and didnt even know it

At a dark time in my life, I worked at a pilot in-store branch of a large bank inside a Dunkin Donuts. As no one goes to a Dunkin for a mortgage, my manager Lori and her ABM Scott came up with increasingly diabolical sales techniques to humiliate us.

I didn't last more than six months before quitting. I share these stories solely so you can find joy in how insane it all was.

Chapter 5: This Man is Dead.

It was sort of understood that people with real banking needs didn't come to the Donut branch to get them taken care of.

We had a handful of runners from local businesses who would do their cash deposits with us and then grab a coffee, none of whom banked with our bank, and that was it. Even customers that we brought on board would go to the traditional Branch when they actually needed something serious; who wants to establish a trust fund at a Dunkin' Donuts?

This all changed one day when a customer we'd never met before came in. We'll call him Ron.

Ron was one of those guys who, just from looking at him, you knew that he was either perpetually broke or ran a construction firm and had more money than he knew what to do with. There was no in between with someone like Ron.

Ron came over to me while I was sitting at the teller counter, and asked if he could speak with a banker. Rather than explain the high marketing out-of-the-box concept behind in-store universal banking like they insisted we should, I simply told him that I was a banker.

His next request caught me off guard. Ron explained that he was the power of attorney on his father's account. He informed me that his father was in declining health and would be moved to an assisted living facility. At the advice of his CPA and his attorney, he was closing his father's account and moving it into an account in his name. Ron explained that his father could not have any assets in his name when he passed, as they would be heavily taxed.

I looked at the account. Sure enough, Ron was power of attorney. The POA was seven years old and fully verified. Ron had two forms of id, the original hard-notarized Power of Attorney with him, and even had brought paperwork from the assisted living facility he would be moved to. Ron was incredibly well prepared and ready to present any and all identification and documentation to get this transaction done.

Something didn't feel right. Who the hell did something like this at a Dunkin' donuts?

Ron had been a customer with our bank since the 70s, but I had never seen him in our branch before. I looked at Ron's account, and it seemed like he was a regular at the traditional branch , which was currently still open. In fact, every transaction he made as far back as our computer would go was only at that branch. What was he doing here?

""Just a moment,"" I smiled awkwardly ""we'd be more than happy to assist you, I just need to reach out to...""

""I'm moving these assets into CDs at this bank."" Ron growled ""I'm dividing them up into 250k each at five years. Do you not know how to do that? Can I talk to someone else here who knows how to do their job?""

Okay, Ron was dividing these CDs up in a very specific way and not laddering them. Our savings incentive credit capped out at 250k, it almost seemed like his CD structure was designed to tempt a banker. He was being pushy too. Something wasn't right here.

Suddenly I heard the sound of a lumbering bear. Lori slammed through the door like a Kodiak as she rushed out of the back room, where she had been eating her lunch and likely spying on us through the security cameras, as she often loved to do.

Lori quickly and abruptly walked in front of me, introducing herself as the manager and shaking Ron's hand. Ron liked this. He smirked as he shook hands with lori, explaining that he was just trying to establish a large relationship with us but I was giving him unnecessary pushback.

""I am SO sorry about her."" Lori pretended to apologize. ""She's new and a little overly cautious. She still needs to learn that we don't need to INVENT additional regulations."" she growled the last part through her teeth.

""Girls do love making up new rules."" Ron laughed. Lori Joined in.

I frowned. Lori had certainly heard that whole conversation through the cameras, did she not find this odd?

I watched as Lori practically pirouetted into the banker office, rolling out the red carpet for Ron and offering him our finest branded bottled water as she closed the door behind him.

I fumed. I was trying to do my due diligence and she was making me sound like a moron. I sighed as I left my station so I could order a coffee from our dunkin'. I definitely needed one. Maybe I was being too cautious?

Chloe, the Dunkin cashier, handed me my coffee as I swiped my card. ""Was that Ron?"" She asked me. I nodded, asking how Chloe knew this guy. ""His dad and two sisters both go to our church."" Chloe explained. ""Poor guy.""

""Poor guy?"" I repeated.

""His father passed away a few days ago."" Chloe nodded.

CRAP. CRAP CRAP CRAP. It all made sense now! Power of attorney ceases upon death. Ron had siblings. He was trying to make an illegal grab for the money and using his now expired POA (and our branch) to do it.

I ran back over to our computer and looked his father up. There was no date of death and I couldn't just take Chloe's word for it. Sneaking over to the phone, I dialed the traditional Branch down the road. The woman who answered the phone was named Charlene. Charlene sounded bubbly and almost happy to answer; there wasn't a hint of stress or self-loathing in her voice. Is this what working at a traditional Branch was like?

""Hi Charlene,"" I responded awkwardly ""I'm calling from the in-store Branch, and-""

""Oh, Darlene's branch? "" she interrupted happily. ""How's Doug handling the pace over there?""

""No, Lori's."" I corrected ""at the Dunkin Donuts?""

""Oh, right."" she laughed. ""I always forget you guys are there.""

I internally groaned like Marge Simpson as I pressed on. ""So sorry to bother you, but we have a customer of yours here, ron, and I needed to-""

""OH GOD, RON WENT TO THE FRIGGIN DUNKIN BRANCH!"" Charlene shouted. I couldn't tell if she was addressing me or alerting her branch. ""Listen, Ron's father is dead! The system is having an issue updating the date of death on our browser, but it's hard coded in the core system already! DO NOT let him cash that account out! Your branch will be held responsible!​""

I pulled up our core system and looked at his profile. I felt the color drain from my face. ​ She was right, the date of death was right there! ​​ The computer system wouldn't give Lori any warning. ​​

I ran over to lori's office. She was having an animated discussion with him as she began removing CD tickets from our negotiables drawer. CRAP.

I banged on the glass and waved to get Lori's attention. Lori apologized to ron, walking over to the window and pulling the shade down.

I need to take a moment now to make it perfectly clear that I did not care if Lori got fired. I did know however, that Lori would almost certainly find some way to pin this on us, and that she had enough friends in upper management that they would let her.

I knocked on the door several times, but Lori kept yammering on, pretending not to hear me. Suddenly, I heard a click. She had locked the damn door. Why did these doors even have locks? Wasn't this a security risk?!

I ran to the break room and grabbed our ABM, Scott, telling him what was going on. Scott rang Lori's office phone, but she'd already taken it off the hook. She was determined to get a million dollars worth of new money, even if it ruined our careers.

I stared at her door, distraught, not sure what to do. Should we send an email to the regional? I knew she and our regional manager regularly went out for girls nights, this could blow up in my face.

Suddenly, I turned around as I noticed there was a large figure standing at our counter. It was Jay, the Dunkin manager. Jay was an absolutely enormous mountain of a dude: big hairy arms, Super Mario mustache; the works. I looked over to Chloe, who mouthed out something. Though I couldn't quite see what she was saying with my glasses, I could understand her expression. She had almost certainly told her manager what was going on.

Jay said nothing, walking up to the external door to the banker office and knocking so hard, it sounded like a police knock.

That seemed to do it. Lori quieted down and timidly open to the door to see Jay there. ""Yes?"" She asked, all aggression suddenly drained from her voice.

""Sorry,"" Jay apologized ""I just saw Ron go in there."" He leaned in and looked at Ron  ""When you got your coffee this morning, I didn't have a chance to tell you how sorry I was for your father's death. He was a good man. Coffee tomorrow is on me, pal. God bless."" Jay walked away.

Ron turned white as a sheet. Lori turned even whiter.

""I..."" Lori stammered to Ron ""I... Well... I'm sorry, policy... I... I may not actually be able to open that account at this time, but if you'd like to move some investments over from Bank of America like we discussed, i... I can still...""

""Like I'd do anything like that at a friggin Dunkin!"" Ron cursed and stomped out of the branch.

Lori turned to me with and look of absolute disgust on her face. ""AND WHEN WERE YOU GOING TO REVEAL THAT LITTLE TIDBIT?!""

I was so mad, it was so obvious that Lori knew something was wrong. She had literally just chastised me for trying to do too much due diligence. I tried to explain what was going on with the death date in the system, but she insisted that no such issue was possible.

I was given a verbal warning for not following policy after being scolded earlier for adhering too strictly to policy. I asked Scott to back me up, but he looked at his feet and went back into the break room.

Chloe made me an offer to become a cashier at the Dunkin' again. I told her I would if it wasn't for the bank's health insurance. Looking back, I think it would have been a less stressful choice to incur six figures in medical debt.

TLDR: Traditional Branch customer snuck over to us to drain his dead father's POA. ​​Guy got called out by the manager of the Dunkin. I got in trouble because why not. ​",2,1771681698.0,TalesFromYourBank,0,1.0,False

I have been around recently and maybe you saw my post about how I want to change my proffession to become a pilot recently.

To give you a short background about my story, I have this thought since 8-10 years and I have been actively searching and applying to options I got. Fast forward to last year, I have applied one of the companies pilot training program and made it to the final stage. Just before the final interview, I had an urgent back surgery that in the end resulted with disqualification for that application.

Since then, I was focused on my recovery and last weekend, I have consulted aviation doctors and they said I can actually obtain mandatory first class medical report to become a pilot and coincidentally, the company opened new pilot training program the same day. So right now, I’m just waiting and wondering what they will say about it. I will chase this to the end.

I talked this about my parents and I told them I want to attend private flight schools if things go sideways. I know its expensive and in the meantime, I’m trying to save some money too and I told them hopefully we can do it together.

I’m not happy, though thankful about everything I have been through recently. Every decision and plan I make is alternative to become a pilot so I think thats why I’m sad and since we got some kind of green light from professional doctors, I think I will chase this to the end.

I hope you guys have a great weekend, right now I’m outside drinking coffee with thinking about next couple months and venting my thoughts out to you. I also hope this will be the year whoever chasing their dreams have their success in the end.

My last cup took 59sec, barely got out a drip of espresso, and then the message on the screen was ""brewing too fast, decrease grind size""

How can it be too fast if it was nearly a minute and didn't get any coffee out?

My girlfriend and I broke up during Valentine’s week and it’s been a bit tough lately. Not here to blame anyone or create drama — just feeling a little lonely and thought maybe talking to someone new might help.
If anyone (preferably from Delhi NCR) is also looking for genuine conversation, coffee plans, or random late-night talks, feel free to DM.
Not interested in anything paid, transactional, or scam stuff — just real, respectful conversations.
If you’re more comfortable talking on Instagram, you can connect with me there as well — @rex1.290

1rarfa7,https://www.reddit.com/r/horrorstories/comments/1rarfa7/the_romsey_slasher/,The Romsey Slasher,"It was that time of year again when the leaves were dying and bringing the crowds of people who were from out of town. Romsey is a small, isolated town, and their annual fall festival is the highlight of the year. This year, a dark force lurked in the background. It was plotting and calculating the moves it would make, knowing exactly who its victims would be.

With a mask fitted to their face, they blended in with the cheerful crowds. Laughter drowned the unease, though as night fell, the first victim was found. They took pride in grotesquely displaying their kill like a trophy in the town square. The people of the town began to panic; rumors spread like wildfire. The killer knew that they were afraid and laughed at the feeble attempts to figure out who they were.

Can the townspeople uncover who the masked slasher is?

Or will they become part of the gruesome display in the town square…

Harvey pulled his jacket around himself to shield himself from the cold as he made his way down the driveway of his family home. It had been a while since he had been back in his hometown of Romsey. Harvey wouldn’t have come back if his father hadn’t fallen and hurt his back. When he first received the call, he was thinking the worst, but upon hearing the man’s voice on the other end, he exhaled a sigh of relief. So, Harvey took emergency leave from work to go take care of his father until he got better.

Right now, he was making his way to the local diner down the road to grab some breakfast for himself and his father. Neither one of them was as good of a cook as his late mother, but they cooked what was easy in order to survive. Plus, it had been some time since Harvey had a taste of Julie’s Diner. Walking down the sidewalk, he stopped at the crosswalk, waiting for the light, and went across. The parking lot was semi-packed since it wasn’t the morning rush, pulling open the door, the bell jingled, alerting his presence.

“Well, if it ain’t Thomas’s boy. How have you been, Harvey? Are you dining in or placing a to-go order?” an older woman with a high-top bun on her head greeted with a smile.

“Good to see you too, Julie. A to-go order, please.” Harvey sat down at the island bar and picked up a menu, glossing it over. Julie had been running this place since he was in diapers. Taking over from her father, who passed it down to her after his passing. It hit the town hard when Pop’s, Michael Ringer, died of a heart attack. Julie and her mother ran the diner until she had to place her into a retirement home.

The day he left Romsey was when Harvey heard that Julie lost her mom too.

Placing his order, he looked over at the mounted TV on the wall while he waited. Listening to the local news report detailing a body that had been found in Champions Square. A murder in a town like Romsey? Harvey thought to himself, quirking an eyebrow. It had to be the most surprising news ever since… when the Durlin Bridge went out during a heavy rainstorm. “Hard to believe, isn’t it?” said Julie, her voice low.

“Yeah, it’s quite a surprise.” Harvey agreed. He was starting to think that someone had gotten bored of the peace and quiet Romsey offered. Or they had some sort of grudge against the people here. The order was done, and Julie packed it up for him. Harvey paid the tab and made his way out the door.

Harvey bumped shoulders with someone on the way out and muttered an excuse me before continuing on his way. The stranger watched him leave, studying him inquisitively as if he didn’t expect him to be here in town. Harvey didn’t think much of it as he was used to tourists coming into town. He got home and set up the kitchen for dinner. “Pops, I’m back!” Harvey hollered, setting the takeout on the counter to get down some plates and coffee cups.

They ate breakfast in silence other than the usual small talk. Harvey mentioned what he had heard on the news at Julie’s. His father shook his head, saying that it sounded like a copycat. “What do you mean a copycat?” Harvey asked. “When I was a teenager. If I recall, there was a situation like that. Where people who got near the local park mysteriously ended up dead.” His father replied, taking a sip of his coffee.

Harvey pressed a little further, questioning if they ever caught who did it. His father just shrugged, sipping his coffee. He said that the trail was cold, that whoever did it was good at covering their tracks. What didn’t make sense to Harvey was why this copycat was showing up now, years later? Did they get bored and decide that killing a few people would be good amusement?

Whatever the reason, he had to make sure that his was safe. Since the killer didn’t really have a type of person they were after. Anyone could be a target who entered Champions town square. Should he do a stake-out and see if he could spot someone out of place? Harvey shook his head mentally, kicking himself for thinking something so dangerous.

Cleaning up the kitchen, he washed their dishes as his father retired to the living room. The sound of TV being turned on could be heard in the background. Harvey looked out the window, watching as cars drove by and neighbors walked down the sidewalk. They were on their way to the corner store or taking the family pet on a walk. He felt deep down that Romsey would never be the same, and that this first murder was just the start.

The following morning, Harvey took his father to his doctor’s appointment. Halfway to their destination, there was a traffic stop set up. His father mumbled under his breath about how ridiculous this all was. Harvey had disagreed, however, because this killer seemed to have struck again. Just who had this person chosen as their victim this time?

Harvey rolled his window down to talk to the officer who instructed them to stop. He began fishing his ID and registration out of his wallet. Handing it over along with his father’s, the officer looked it over, eyeing Harvey with suspicion. “Is this your son, Thomas?” the officer asked. “Yeah, this is Harvey. Last time you saw him, he was knee-high.” Thomas laughed.

The officer nodded, handing back over the IDs and registration. “Be careful at night if you have to go out,” he warned. Then, he motioned for them to go ahead and move forward. Driving past the town square, where they were busy cleaning up the mess, Harvey glanced over. To his horror, the person being loaded onto the gurney was Julie Ringer. He had just seen her yesterday… was the killer just choosing whoever they felt deserved to die?

Harvey hoped that his father hadn’t seen what he had. It would have quite the impact on him, considering he had known each other for a long time. The appointment went well, with his father being told that the next step would be physical therapy. Thomas was healing as he should and without complications. At least his father wouldn’t need any surgery on his knee.

Later that night, Thomas had gotten a call from some of Julie’s family to break the news to him. Harvey had been the one to answer it, confirming what he had seen earlier. “Who was that on the phone?” Thomas questioned from his recliner in the living room. “That was some of Julie’s family…. they uh found her body this morning in Champions Square.” Harvey cleared his throat, making his way back to the living room head down.

Thomas paled, turning his head to look back at the TV, tears pricking at the edges of his eyes. “Harvey, have a seat. I need to tell you about what happened back in 1978,” said his father, motioning to the couch. His father muted the tv and rubbed his sore knee and began to tell his story. When he was about eighteen, there had been a string of murders that happened in Emerald Park. The police didn’t have any leads, and since there wasn’t any evidence left behind.

The killer would put the deceased into a sitting position; hands folded in their lap and eyes closed. As if they were taking a nap and would be waking up any time. Probably reveling in all of the reactions they were getting when people realized that the person they were trying to wake up was dead. First it was Thomas’s older sister, and then Julie’s mother a month later. The killer was calculated, never picking similar victims with each kill and never more than one victim at a time.

Those murders went unsolved, and after a year, they just stopped. Now something similar was happening again. Except this copycat was killing more than one person and changing the location. Even the position of the bodies was arranged in an unusual way compared to the previous killer. Flat on their back, legs together, and hands over their closed eyes.

Not even a speck of blood anywhere. For the longest time, they thought it had to be someone with medical knowledge. Because when they examined the bodies, all of the blood had been drained. Not a single scar left behind to indicate where the blood had been taken from. For the longest time, people swore whoever it was must be a vampire, a cultist, or a black-market dealer.

Honestly, it didn’t matter how many theories they tossed around; it didn’t help with the fact that people were being killed. Thomas continued explaining that he once stayed up late at night watching the park. Waiting to see if he could spot who had been bringing the bodies into Emerald Park and setting them up. He was about to call it quits and go home when he saw it. A tall figure was walking through the early morning fog, carrying a body in their arm.

Their complexion was warm sepia, reddish-brown. Tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. When Thomas saw them, they had an eerie glow to them. The figure sat the latest victim up on the bench, placing their hands in their lap. They had said something, but it was in a language he didn’t know.

“Do you remember what they said?” Harvey asked.

Thomas furrowed his brow “Che il tuo sacrificio non sia vano.” he replied.

Harvey leaned back, slumping into the couch. It was Italian for “ may your sacrifice not be in vain.” At least, he was sure. Did it have to do with the blood? Or had other things been taken out of the bodies as well? According to his father, there were no surgical scars when the medical examiner had looked at the bodies.

There was something that was being overlooked. Tomorrow, he would see if he couldn’t get into the morgue to see someone. Harvey had a gut feeling that something was being overlooked. He desperately wanted to get down to the bottom of it. For his father and all of the other past victims who were hard by this.

Morning soon came, and he felt as if he hadn’t slept at all. Going into the small hospital, Romsey had Harvey make the excuse that he was there to ID a body. He didn’t know if any deceased had come in unclaimed, but he was willing to take a shot. The receptionist took a moment and nodded, confirming that there was one unclaimed body. She then instructed him where to go from the reception desk, and he nervously boarded an old, rickety elevator.

As the elevator descended down into the morgue, the lights slightly flickered. Chills made their way down Harvey’s spine. This was beginning to feel like a bad horror movie. The doors creaked open, and he stepped out, making his way down a singular hallway to a set of double doors. There before him was a motionless body underneath a white sheet.

Looking around, he didn’t see anyone around, so he reached out and pulled the sheet down. The face that looked back at him looked familiar to him. Harvey hadn’t seen this person before, but the description of them flooded into his mind. The warm sepia, reddish-brown complexation, and tawny eyes with gold blending through the brown. This had to be him, the man that his father told him about the… Romsey Slasher.

Harvey took a step back as the man rose up off the table and began walking towards him. As he backed away, he could feel the door dig into his back. All he had to do was grab the knob and turn it. The man reached out his hand, a hole opening in his palm, and an inky black tentacle slithered out. Harvey let out a gasp, and the tentacle saw its chance, diving down his throat with a sickening gurgle.

Thomas was on his second cup of coffee this morning. Since he hadn’t been able to sleep the previous night, Harvey didn’t come home last night, and Thomas was worried that something had happened to him. Making his way to the living room, he turned on the tv and flipped through the channels. Thomas only stopped when a news flash appeared on the screen.

The new reporter described a young man in his thirties and noted him as a local to the town. When they showed a picture of Harvey, he dropped his coffee cup. It shattered on the ground, spilling its contents mixing with porcelain.

I wanted to share my journey, hoping it resonates with some of you out there grinding on your own dreams. A few years back, I was stuck in a rut. Lost my job unexpectedly, savings were dwindling faster than my optimism, and honestly, I was eating an embarrassing amount of instant ramen. The walls of my tiny apartment felt like they were closing in, and the idea of 'starting over' was just… terrifying.

But a spark ignited – a silly little idea I'd always tinkered with: making custom pet portraits. I loved drawing, and my friends always complimented my sketches of their furry companions. So, with literally nothing to lose, I decided to lean into it. I dug out my old art supplies, watched a gazillion YouTube tutorials on digital art, and even learned some basic website design late into the night, fueled by cheap coffee and sheer stubbornness.

Those first few months were brutal. Rejection after rejection. Crickets on my social media posts. I remember one week I made exactly $12.50 from a single commission, and I almost burst into tears of frustration. There were so many moments I just wanted to throw in the towel, pack it all in, and apply for any soul-crushing corporate job that would take me. The self-doubt was a monster, constantly whispering, ""You're not good enough, this is stupid, just quit.""

But something kept me going. Maybe it was the occasional heartwarming review from a customer who loved their pet's portrait, or the sheer terror of going back to a conventional job I hated. I just kept sketching, kept posting, kept learning. Slowly, painstakingly, orders started trickling in. Then they became a steady stream. Fast forward to today, and that ""silly little idea"" is now my full-time income. I wake up every day excited to create, and the smell of fresh coffee in my studio beats stale office air any day.

It wasn't a glamorous overnight success story, trust me. It was a messy, anxiety-ridden climb. But it taught me that sometimes, when you feel like you've hit rock bottom, that's exactly where you find the foundation to build something incredible. What's one crazy idea you've secretly harbored, and what's holding you back from just trying?",1,1771681329.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

V60: 15:240gm ratio, two 50gm blooms, let them drain and then 140gm in the third pour. Water just off boil at the start. 2:30 brew time. 

Taste: Noticeable winey bitterness, chocolate note is also prominent, aroma is very jammy when grinding which is a bit more subdued in the final cup. Not very noticeable sweetness. Decent amount of acidity. No funkiness to my palate.

Paper filtered SIF: Wetted paper filter at the bottom, 12:96gm. 36gm bloom, wait 30 seconds, 60gm second pour and brew time of 3:00 roughly. Water just off boil. Drank undiluted. Clean, winey and very sweet, rich mouthfeel, brewed aroma reminded me of Amla murabba, and the jam aroma was much more preserved. Similar acidity to V60. 

Overall, I really liked it. It was great to have iced as well as the mild fruitiness and bitterness are nice to sip on. Very good value for money and exceeded expectation. 

Side note: One of the brews had the smell of scented erasers which was very confusing but the taste seemed very similar. This was with a 5 pour recipe and the acidity was more pronounced but overall the profile stayed roughly same as V60. ",2,1771680959.0,IndiaCoffee,3,1.0,False

I miss the school days, when making friends was as easy as walking up to someone and asking to be their friend.  
  
Over the last few months, I've noticed that a lot of people want a lot more friends in their city, but real connections, not just networking or dating for the hell of it, like tinder. People look for just other decent people to grab coffee, hit the gym or see a gig literally any sort of connection.

Thing is, big platforms just push huge socials or corporate events. Most of those one off meetups don't really progress anywhere, because it's not 'cosy' enough? Not to mention the egregious money sucking fools behind those apps, who want nothing but profit.

I've started building something called Rooted, and the idea is pretty simple. I want smaller more close connections between people who actually want to connect, and I am going to try my best to keep it as easy as possible for everyone, because my main goal is to promote connectivity. **If I can avoid it, I don't want to take a single penny out of any of my users.** 

If you've struggled to build a GOOD social circle as an adult, or moved city and felt kind of disconnected, then maybe this might be the right kind of thing for you.

Booked a garden view room, 2nd floor. Lovely view from the balcony. Room was clean, bed was comfy, & water pressure good. Never really got a good handle on the a/c….it worked well just not a person who cares for trying to figure that kind of thing out. 

We ordered room service for breakfast just once. Small selection of choices but they were tasty and the coffee was hot.  We spend little time in our room so we go with the cheapest. 

Resort size is perfect. It is a quick walk to anywhere you want to go. No need for a ride anywhere and it is mostly flat. Only significant stairs are to the lobby or the room if you are not ground level. 

Food  was good. Never a bad meal. Buffet was solid, breakfast was usually busy so occasionally had to wait a minute for pans to be refilled but nothing to really complain about. Refills of coffee tended to be a little more difficult depending on the staff that were working, some much more attentive than others. Lychee restaurant was definitely our favorite. Love the additions of the coffee bar and veggie bar. 

Drinks were solid, never watered down. There is a cocktail menu if you can get your hands on one, definitely worth checking out. Only thing is it doesn’t list if something is a blended frozen drink versus mixed drink. We love the dirty bananas and purple rains. Ordered beers and mixed drinks too, never disappointed. 

The beach is 2nd to none. Plenty of chairs and shade to go around. Water was calm at the beginning of the trip but got a little rougher. Still great to dip in to cool off. It is on a public beach so you can walk quite a ways. The resort does have you report your room number to security when you walk off the resorts part of the beach so they know if you return or not (doesn’t feel unsafe, just added reassurance in my opinion). 

Entertainment isn’t something we care too much about but kudos to the gentleman who played/sang down at the beach bonfire. Very enjoyable. 

Staff were mostly great. A few were not as sociable but still poured solid cocktails. 

Overall a favorite resort of ours. Totally chill vibe. Will definitely be back.

I recently purchased a second hand Rancilio Silvia V5 E but I think there is something wrong:

  
After turning the device on and heating it up for about 20-25 minutes the water coming out of the shower head is quite hot and steamy but after 2-5 seconds the water is significantly colder. Unfortunately I don’t have a good thermometer right now, but I‘m going to get one and add precise readouts later. The water is still hot but I can easily keep my finger in it for a couple of seconds before it becomes unbearable (for comparison: the water coming from my Rocket Appartamento after flushing is really hot, I can’t touch it for any longer than half a second).

  
So the shots I pull from the Silvia are also rather warm than hot and the taste is rather sour compared to shots pulled with the same coffee/grind on my Rocket.

  
It does not seem like the steaming function is affected though, there is quite a lot of steam pressure and the water coming out before the steam is insanely hot as well.



Any further steps I can take to assess the problem?

Just an ordinary day.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

Morning. He sat on the edge of the bed, soft light from the window spilling across the floor.  
Tomorrow is normal. That’s what he told himself every morning, even if he barely believed it.

He stretched, pulled on a hoodie, and went to the kitchen. Coffee sat untouched on the table, as if yesterday had never happened. He turned on the kettle. The sound of dripping water filled the quiet room.

Three missed calls blinked on his phone: “Mom”, “Mom”, “Mom.”  
\- Later… - he muttered, - not now.

He took a sip of coffee, now lukewarm. A small habit, lifting the spoon from the edge of the cup before drinking, was followed as always. He smiled faintly, though it didn’t reach his eyes.

At work, his computer screen stared back with a blank document. The cursor blinked. Words didn’t come. A colleague passed by.

“You okay?”  
“Yeah,” he said, not looking up. “Just stayed up late yesterday.”

The thought flickered in his mind, it wasn’t the first day he said that. He barely remembered yesterday, only flashes of routine: coffee, the walk, the blinking screen.

Outside, people walked down the street, talking, laughing. Cars stopped at the lights, children yelled, playing in the yard. Everything moved as usual. Everyone else seemed real, and that reassured him slightly.

A message from his mother appeared:  
“Please call me.”

He opened the chat. Half the messages were emojis and short words. He scrolled through, then closed the phone. Later, he thought. Always later.

After lunch, he went outside, wearing a light jacket. A breeze ruffled his hair. He walked along the sidewalk. People passed him, some smiling at strangers, some talking on the phone. He glanced at a shop window. His reflection looked almost normal, but his face seemed slightly blurred, like someone had forgotten to draw it. He blinked. Probably just his imagination.

In the evening, he bought bread at a small store. The cashier smiled.

\- Have a good evening!  
\- Thanks, - he replied automatically, repeating a phrase he had heard every day.

Back at his apartment, he sat on the bed. The walls were empty. The soft glow of a lamp illuminated the room. He took off his shoes, placed his bag in the corner. He opened the window: the faint hum of cars, a bird’s occasional cry, the scent of wet asphalt. Everything felt normal.

He lay down, staring at the ceiling. Today seemed a little brighter than yesterday. He remembered the morning coffee, cold now, its taste almost erased from memory.

Tomorrow will be normal, he repeated to himself. Inside, there was a strange sense of calm, though his mind whispered that something wasn’t right.

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

A hospital room. Silence. Machines beeped softly, but he no longer heard them. His body lay connected to monitors. The line on the screen was straight, unchanging.

A nurse covered the body with a sheet. He stood beside his own bed, eyes fixed on the body. He opened his mouth, trying to speak. No sound came out.

⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻⸻

Tomorrow was the lie his mind created so he wouldn’t realize that today had already ended.

I'm just having a moment and need a bit of peer support. I'm 3wpo from an open abdominal total hysterectomy and my recovery has been honestly really uneventful and easy, minor pain at the incision site while it was healing but nothing else.

This morning I woke up, went to the bathroom, went downstairs, made myself a coffee, picked up my cat (he's under ten lb), and sat on the couch. Then I noticed a kind of dull/throbbing pain internally, feels like it's about were my vaginal cuff would likely be. I didn't do anything weird or strenuous that I can think of. 

My gyno/surgeon's office is closed on weekends and I don't think I was given any other number to call. Her clinic is affiliated with the hospital where I got my surgery so I could probably try contacting them but honestly wouldn't know where to start. She did tell me to go to the ER if I had any issues but I don't think this requires an ER visit. I don't have any discharge or blood or anything.

I did call a provincial non emergency 24h nursing line and they advised to just rest, take Tylenol, and monitor, and they gave me clear criteria to look for togo to the emergency room.

I just took some Tylenol and I'm trying to just breathe through the anxiety. The pain was hovering between a 4-6 out of ten but it's already coming down and the Tylenol hasn't had time to start working. I will wait a few hours and reevaluate.

My asks:

1) can people please tell me stories of post op pain that turned out to be just fine?

2) please don't say anything that will escalate my anxiety. I'm taking it seriously and absolutely will get medical care if the pain persists or worsens or if I start bleeding and have already spoken to a nurse. I'm looking for and need reassurance right now, not urgency ❤️‍🩹

1raqz4q,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1raqz4q/never_go_blank_again_4_go_to_jokes_anyone_can_use/,Never go blank again 4 go to jokes anyone can use and why they actually work,"Ever been in a convo, all eyes on you, and your brain just… dies? Like, total blank. Social pressure hits, everyone’s expecting you to be funny or at least *say something*, and nothing clever shows up. Super common. Especially in work stuff, dates, or group hangs where the vibe’s a little stiff.

The worst part isn’t going blank. It’s that weird panic of knowing you *could* be funny if your mind just worked. But here’s the thing: humor isn’t just raw talent. It’s a practiced social skill. Researchers like Dr. Jennifer Aaker from Stanford say humor is *one of the most effective tools* for building trust and connection fast. Even a “meh” joke can lower stress and boost likability. But most of us never build an actual mental toolkit for it.

Instagram and TikTok are flooded with “funny” content, but most of it’s performative, chaotic, or just doesn’t translate to real life. So here’s a no-BS, research-backed list of **go-to jokes** that *actually work in daily convos*, drawn from observational comedy, social psychology, and improv playbooks.

These aren’t dad jokes or meme references. They’re joke *formats* anyone can use, no matter the topic.

**• The “It’s like…” analogy joke**  
This is improv 101. Take something ordinary and describe it with a bizarre, exaggerated comparison.

>“This coffee is so strong it’s filing taxes in its own name.”  
Why it works: Our brains love unexpected associations. As Scott Dikkers (founder of The Onion) teaches in his writing course, humor = truth + exaggeration + surprise.

**• The “self-deprecating overconfident” twist**  
Start with a brag, end with a self-roast.

>“I’m basically the Picasso of procrastination. True visionary.”  
Used effectively by stand-up comedians like Hasan Minhaj and Bo Burnham, this style shows confidence *and* humility. Research from the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology (2021) found that balanced self-deprecation actually increases social likability.

**• The “calling it out” meta joke**  
Comment on the situation as it is, in a clever way.

>“This meeting feels like a TED Talk where no one has a script.”  
This is rooted in shared reality. As Dr. Peter McGraw from the Humor Research Lab explains, benign violations of normal behavior (like awkward moments) are the *sweet spot* for group laughter.

**• The “fake inspirational quote”**  
Say something absurd like it’s wisdom.

>“Give a person a fish, and you feed them for a day. Teach them to ghost their ex, and they’ll thrive forever.”  
This format taps into our pattern recognition. You follow the rhythm of clichés, then twist the punchline. TikTok humor thrives on these bait-and-switch lines for good reason.

You don’t need to “be funny” all the time. But having 2 or 3 of these joke formats ready can instantly make you feel more confident and loosen up tense convos. It’s not about being the clown. It’s how you bring a bit of lightness on command.

1raqwhz,https://i.redd.it/p7qtkxuzkukg1.png,Any substitute for my Brewista gooseneck?,"I've had the brewista for the last 7+ years. This picture is old, it was pretty new at the time.

I find it really nice and the only complaints:

\-the fake wood accents became ruined after a very short time...they are not scratches, the outer finish will just lose parts with the time even taking very good care of it, the top knob in my case was black on most of its surface. I built a real wood top part for the lid, the handle is still the same and is almost fine. Picture shows the original state but it got bad very quick to the point that the part on the lid was a black plasticky mess.

\-the electronics are weird, sometimes it will stop heating up, or the display will show 00:00 instead of heating the water and things like that. Mostly it gets fixed by completely restarting the heating process (and pulling up the kettle), though all the contacts are clean

Anyway, in my wishlist I always had the Fellow EKG, possibly in white (I see they don't have it in brushed steel). The best would be to have it in white with walnut (and not maple). I understand it would be possible to do it if I buy the handle extra (not possible to combine them). I also notice it's super hard for me to order it, that is why I am asking if at the moment you would recommend something instead of the fellow, which is just so hard to find for some reason (europe).

At work I got a gooseneck from aliexpress just to try it out...it's fine, it's just super slow to heat up, and the flow control is not the best.

1raqt5i,https://www.reddit.com/r/xxketo/comments/1raqt5i/any_other_keto_to_carnivores_here_that_can_help/,Any other keto to carnivores here that can help with some clarity?,"I’ve been keto forever (real time 12 years) before going carnivore-ish about a month ago. I made the change slowly over time by cutting out more and more foods with fiber to help with gut issues. I got to the point where I was only eating a small amount of cooked zucchini with my otherwise animal based plate and decided to see what it was like without. I feel incredible. For the first time ever I don’t have to worry about bloating, constipation, anything 💩 related. It’s liberating. I say carnivore-ish because I still drink coffee, use cacao powder and stevia, and some condiments that aren’t totally animal based. 

The issue is, I’m noticing a few other physical changes and I’m wondering if it’s a dietary transitional thing or perhaps it has more to do with my hormones, as I am 46 and in early perimenopause according to my hormone testing. 

For the first time ever I am experiencing breast tenderness in the weeks leading up to my period. My period was also almost totally painless and I only bled for a few days. 

I am also drier when my partner and I have sex (this was never and issue) and because of that dryness I have now had two friction related UTIs (which I also have gone a lifetime without.) I bought lube and I’m learning how much I now need, but it’s such a new experience that I had to take note and wonder what is causing it. I thought perhaps it’s a mixture of lower progesterone, less natural lubrication and a different ph of my urine from basically zero carb? It’s not bacterial. 

I’ve also noticed interesting changes in my face and skin. Where my face had hallowed out before it’s looking fuller and more youthful. I’ve never had acne but I used to have these small hard white things under my skin that I could only dig out with lots of effort and scarring…now the are coming to the surface and healing. Weird. 

I felt sheepish about posting this on the r/carnivore subreddit for some reason, so thought I’d start here where it’s just us ladies.

The sauce, seasoning and toppings were delicious and the portion felt just right. Cost was £5.50 which I think is super reasonable compared to what you get for more at Pret in N16…

1raqsjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightshift/comments/1raqsjp/would_you_switch_from_permanent_day_shift_to/,Would you switch from permanent day shift to monthly rotating night shift for a $50k raise and a promotion?,"TL;DR, I’m a police officer working the day shift in a specialized unit. Should I accept a $50k raise to become a sergeant and return to rotating night shifts (I detest nights and don’t really need the money) yes I had Apple Intelligence rewrite this whole thing, I am tired and forgot to buy coffee beans. 

I’m not asking this on LEO subreddits because I’m certain they require verification through your work email and other means, and I’m not willing to do that.

Currently, I work exclusively on the day shift in a specialized unit. My shifts follow a “pitman schedule,” which means I work two days, have two days off, work three days, have two days off, work two days, and have three days off. This schedule ensures that I’m off on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays every other week, and I work those days on the opposite days, from 6 am to 6 pm. Essentially, I mirror the day shift patrol division and work alongside them.

My responsibilities are quite niche. I primarily investigate motor vehicle collisions, ranging from minor fender benders to serious and fatal crashes. Additionally, I have other traffic-related duties. I genuinely enjoy my job and love going to work every day.

The sergeant exam is approaching, and a promotion is a possibility in the near future. If promoted, I would return to the patrol division as a road sergeant. With this promotion, I would resume the day shift and night shift rotation once a month, following the same pitman schedule as before.

While I’m not concerned about the “work” and responsibilities of being a sergeant, I absolutely hate night shifts. I have a wife and a one-year-old at home, and we’re hoping to have more children in the future. With her job and other income from real estate, we are already financially comfortable. Although I don’t need the money, the additional $50k (which would increase my annual income) would be incredibly beneficial. She’s also very supportive, she isn’t against this promotion, and I’ve worked night shift before in this job and she agreed we could make it work. I work with plenty of happily married cops who work shift work. (Hint: cop divorce rate isn’t high because of the schedule. It’s the personality traits that attract assholes to this job)

There’s a slim chance that if I spend a few years as a patrol sergeant, I’ll be rewarded for my hard work and given the opportunity to apply for an administrative sergeant position. This position would have different responsibilities and require four ten-hour shifts per week during the day. This would be the ultimate outcome, but there’s a risk that these positions might be locked in by other individuals, forcing me to complete my career (over ten years) as a road sergeant. How far would you go for a $50k raise? ",1,1771679551.0,Nightshift,6,0.55,False

If someone’s skipping meals, eating at random times, surviving on coffee, and constantly crashing energy-wise… their body is basically in stress mode all day and when your body is stressed, your mind reacts more.

Overthinking gets louder.
Anxiety feels heavier.
Mood swings hit harder.
Even small emotional stuff feels huge.
Sometimes it’s not that you’re too much.
Sometimes you’re just under-fueled and overstimulated.

One day, technology advances to the point where a person's entire memory—every childhood experience, every piece of knowledge acquired, everyone they've loved, every hurt they've endured—can be copied like a file and uploaded intact into a supercomputer.

Here's where it gets interesting.

Suppose this uploaded memory continues to receive real-time input from the world. It keeps thinking in the cloud, keeps feeling, and one day speaks to you through a screen: ""Hey, I'm doing pretty well over here."" Would that existence in the cloud count as ""you""?

From a biological standpoint, obviously not. Your body is still sitting right there in front of the computer. Your heart is still beating. Your hand can still feel the warmth of a cup. You remain, unquestionably, the biological you.

But from the perspective of consciousness? That entity possesses everything you've ever experienced. It remembers your first love and the racing of your heart. It recalls the sting of being misunderstood. Its way of speaking, its thought patterns, even those unconscious little habits—they're all indistinguishable from yours. Give it a body and let it stand beside you, and your friends probably couldn't tell which is which.

This is where the real paradox emerges.

If that cloud-based ""you"" is also you, then two of you now exist in the world. From the moment of upload, these two versions begin diverging: you sip coffee in the physical world while it reads a book in the cloud. An hour later, your memories no longer match. Which one is the ""real"" you?

And if that cloud-based ""you"" isn't you—just a perfect replica—then we face an even tougher question: if a replica possesses your complete memory and your entire personality, what justifies denying it the status of ""you""? Does being ""me"" depend solely on occupying this particular mass of flesh and blood?

What makes this thought experiment so compelling is that it forces us to confront something we can't easily answer: What exactly is the self? Is it merely the byproduct of neurons firing, or is it a stream of information that could theoretically be encoded, transferred, and stored?

If the former is true, then uploading memory merely creates a replica that can declare ""I think, therefore I am."" If the latter holds, then while the body inevitably decays, perhaps ""you"" could continue existing in another form.

Of course, there's an even more unsettling version of this scenario: perhaps at the moment of successful upload, both versions feel certain they're the one that's been preserved. You open your eyes and find yourself still in your chair. Meanwhile, it opens its eyes and finds itself in a void of code. Both of you feel alive. Both of you see the other as the replica that got left behind.

So which one is it? No one knows.",1,1771679196.0,askphilosophy,1,1.0,False

It’s about speed, organisation, and delivering a smooth customer experience from the moment someone walks in. In today’s competitive market, relying on outdated methods or manual processes can slow you down. That’s why having a reliable system in place is no longer optional — it’s essential for growth and efficiency.

# Faster Service, Happier Customers

One of the biggest challenges cafés face is managing busy periods. Morning rushes and lunchtime crowds can quickly turn chaotic without the right tools. A reliable system ensures orders are processed quickly and accurately, reducing wait times and keeping lines moving smoothly.

When transactions are fast and simple:

* Customers feel valued and respected
* Staff experience less stress
* Mistakes are reduced
* Service becomes more consistent

In a world where convenience matters, speed can be the difference between a returning customer and a lost opportunity.

# Better Organisation Behind the Counter

Behind every successful café is a well-organised operation. From managing menu items to handling multiple payment types, everything needs to work seamlessly. A dependable system keeps orders, payments, and receipts all in one place.

Key operational benefits include:

* Easy menu updates
* Clear order tracking
* Split bill functionality
* Secure payment handling

With everything centralised, daily tasks become more manageable, allowing you to focus on customer service instead of paperwork.

# Smarter Stock and Sales Management

Inventory issues can quietly damage profits. Running out of popular items or over-ordering stock both hurt your bottom line. Modern systems track inventory automatically, helping you maintain accurate stock levels.

They also provide detailed reports so you can:

* Identify best-selling items
* Track slow-moving products
* Monitor peak sales times
* Analyse revenue trends

Having access to real-time data means you can make confident, informed decisions that support growth.

**cafe point of sale** technology has evolved into a complete business management solution. It not only processes payments but also supports reporting, inventory tracking, and flexible payment methods such as contactless and digital wallets. Cloud-based access allows you to monitor performance from anywhere, giving you peace of mind even when you’re away from the shop floor. A reliable system acts as the backbone of your café, supporting both day-to-day operations and long-term expansion.

In today’s fast-moving environment, customers expect efficiency and convenience. Investing in a dependable system ensures your café can meet those expectations while maintaining accuracy and control. By streamlining operations and providing valuable insights, the right setup helps you build a strong, future-ready business that thrives in a competitive market.",1,1771679010.0,ThePureContent,0,1.0,False

It adds up way faster than I expected.

For example, I make my morning coffee at home now. Buying one outside does not seem like much, but over a year it gets kind of crazy. Before I buy basic stuff, I check a cashback app, my bank’s cashback offers, or the tiktok price drop activity. If I get lucky and finish the progress bar, I can claim it for free, so any little savings helps. I also stopped paying for every subscription on my own. My friends and I each keep the one we use the most, then we share, and the cost feels a lot lighter.

Hey. I’m not in immediate danger or anything but I’ve been having a rough time mentally and feeling really isolated. Right now my world consists of my husband and our dog. I'm unemployed, lost touch with friends due to my mental health, and not much family support. I feel like I’m slowly losing my grip on reality a bit from the isolation.

I don’t necessarily need deep trauma talks. I don't think I have the capacity for that tbh. I think I just need someone to exchange normal, boring daily things with. Like “I made coffee,” “I went for a walk,” “I watched a dumb show,” ""I am grateful for tap water,"" etc. Just small reminders that life is still happening. I am still here. Nothing is a threat. Yknow?

I can offer the same back. Just consistency and normalcy. Not looking to trauma-bond or spiral together... just something grounding.

I've been a NEET since 2021. I am a NEET because I have disabilities. I was a wreck for years.

Recently, in the past 6 months, I've taken steps to improve my health. I ceased smoking cigarettes and switched to vaping, I started physical exercise on a stationary bicycle, I started caring more about my diet and watching what I eat, I significantly cut back on the weed, I started ozempic, I had my psychiatric medication adjusted, I started taking some supplements and multivitamins. I think that's it. I just had a shatter + flower bowl so I'm super cheeched. This is a stoner thoughts post.

My mood has been improving a lot in the past few months. Usually I've just been going through life numb from the weed, but content, or as a miserable bastard. Most days were good and I had some bad days but I am altogether never a tremendously happy person. More of a numb mellow dude.

Yesterday was bizarre. I went to get my psychiatric medication and gave myself my weekly dose of ozempic. I didn't smoke that much weed. I had 1.5 pots of coffee. I was so happy towards the end of the day I borderline felt manic. I kept having happy thoughts and kept dreaming about going back to school or getting a job. I ended up browsing school websites and window shopping job listings. I felt so good and decent.

Today I woke up with some perspective and I feel a bit unsettled. I'm usually not that happy. Yesterday was not a very remarkable day but for some reason it just felt like a tremendously good and decent day.

One of my old coworkers back in the day told me that I'm a miserable bastard and that when I'm happy I go crazy. There's some truth to that.

Today my mood is just normal. I've been smoking a bit more weed than usual and I'm super stoned. My chronic pain is not really bothering me.

I haven't been to a psychiatric ward since 2024 so I hope this honestly wasn't a manic fit. I wonder if it was a reaction to the antipsychotic medication I received.

1raqfis,https://i.redd.it/olu2cz0khukg1.png,"Camel Contests, Comedy Clubs, and Credit-Card Duels: Saudi Arabia Is Not What You Think","If your mental image of Saudi Arabia still involves endless sand dunes, silent streets, and men staring sternly into the distance… it’s time for a software update.

Because today’s Saudi Arabia is hosting camel beauty pageants, importing world-class comedians, building Six Flags-sized thrill rides, and engaging in what might be the most competitive national sport of all: **fighting over who pays the dinner bill.**

Yes. Let’s start there.

# Misconception #1: Saudis are “too serious”

Anyone who’s ever had dinner with Saudis knows the real national pastime isn’t football — it’s *credit card warfare*. The rules are simple: whoever secretly gives their card to the waiter first wins. Losers protest loudly. Victors pretend it was “nothing.” Entire friendships are built and broken over who paid for the hummus.

This is a culture where generosity is competitive and hospitality is an extreme sport.

Serious? Please.

# Misconception #2: There’s no entertainment scene

Meanwhile, in Riyadh, **Dave Chappelle, Bill Burr, and Jack Whitehall** are on stage cracking jokes about their own misconceptions of the Kingdom at the inaugural **Riyadh Comedy Festival** (running late 2025 into 2026). Western comics flew in expecting one thing — and left with their stereotypes roasted.

In Jeddah, audiences are lining up for *The Seventh Floor*, a dark comedy play inspired by the Seven Deadly Sins. It’s moody. It’s sharp. It’s hilarious. And it’s absolutely not what people imagine when they think of “conservative desert society.”

Saudi comedy right now isn’t whispering — it’s mic-dropping.

# Misconception #3: The culture is old-fashioned

Let’s talk about camels.

Not just riding camels — *glamour camels*.

At the **Janadriyah Camel Stadium**, Saudi hosts full-scale camel beauty contests. Yes, beauty contests. Judges inspect posture, lips, eyelashes, symmetry — and the winners are treated like supermodels with hooves. Think *Vogue Arabia: Camel Edition.*

Add to that competitive camel racing and specialized events, and suddenly you realize: this isn’t old-fashioned — it’s *heritage with a production budget.*

# Misconception #4: There’s “nothing to do” in Saudi

Six Flags Qiddiya City is now open, bringing “XL-sized” thrill rides to the region. Roller coasters. Mega drops. The kind of rides that make your soul temporarily leave your body and come back with trust issues.

So now your Saudi itinerary can look like this: Morning: Coffee in Diriyah. Afternoon: Camel supermodel judging. Evening: Bill Burr stand-up set. Night: Roller coaster that erases your memory.

But yes — totally boring.

# Misconception #5: Saudis don’t get the joke

Saudi humour is dry. Fast. Self-aware. And surprisingly savage.

Comedians who come expecting polite silence get hit with roaring laughter — especially when they make fun of Saudi itself. Saudis *love* laughing at their own quirks: the over-hospitality, the dramatic family WhatsApp groups, the obsession with coffee, the “no, no, no I will pay” Olympics.

This is a society that knows exactly how it looks from the outside — and is increasingly happy to flip the script with style.

# The Truth?

Saudi Arabia isn’t trying to be something else. It’s just finally letting people see what’s already there:

✔ A deep culture of generosity ✔ A booming entertainment scene ✔ A wild sense of humour ✔ Heritage that’s confident enough to have fun with itself

The biggest misconception about Saudi isn’t that it’s strict, or serious, or silent.

It’s that people think they already know it.

And if you still picture Saudi Arabia as a place with no laughter, no nightlife, and no surprises — just wait until a camel in false eyelashes wins a beauty crown while a Saudi friend steals your waiter to pay your bill.

1raqffb,https://www.reddit.com/r/IsraelPalestine/comments/1raqffb/the_tribes_of_israel_kaplanists/,The Tribes of Israel: Kaplanists,"If you want to understand modern Israel, you have to understand that it isn’t one country in a normal sense. It’s a federation of tribes that share an army. Sure, we overlap and intermarry. But Israel is a collection of tribes nonetheless.

This post will be about the Kaplanists. Technically, this is the tribe I belong to the most.

Israel actually is not polarized between left and right. Such structures don't exist here. It is differentiated between tribes with different fears and definitions of what the state is for. The Kaplanists are one of the most powerful of those tribes because they dominate the sectors that produce Israel's global influence: technology, finance, academia, media, law.

The name comes from Kaplan Street in Tel Aviv. This is the heart of Israel's ""Startup Nation"", where AI, quantum computers, biotech, cyber, and more is made and exported around the world. It is all fueled with intense amounts of venture capital pumped out of the small buildings in Sarona Park. The area is hyper advanced, well beyond North Europe, with the best coffee probably on Earth and has a genuine and sincere cyberpunk vibe. If you dropped a Kaplanist into a cafe in Palo Alto or Cambridge, they would blend almost perfectly.

There is something distinctly Central European Jewish about the Kaplan tribe: rationalist, analytical, intellectual, irreverent to tradition. It is very Jewish in the way Freud and Einstein were Jewish: secular, cerebral, and historically aware.

Kaplanists are often deeply skeptical of religious Judaism. Not indifferent, but they are skeptical. For many of them, the Haredi world feels like a different civilization that exists to weaken the same state they occupy.

This skepticism leads to open hostility. In some circles, religious (dosim) is shorthand for backward or parasitic. That caricature is as unfair in my opinion, but it exists, and it shapes the Kaplan tribe's politics.

Politically, Kaplanists are patriotic in a particular way. They believe in Israel intensely: but the Israel they believe in is the startup nation, the high IQ democracy, the liberal-progressive technological powerhouse. Their patriotism is anchored in technology, economy, and global standing.

They want Israel to be admired by the world and by Europe especially. They want it to win Nobel Prizes and such things.

One of the tribe's defining features is its relationship to Bibi Netanyahu.

For Kaplanists, Bibi represents the coalition of tribes they most distrust: religious, populist, nationalist, anti-elite. He is perceived not merely as wrong, but as threatening the future of Israel they identify with.

That perception produces something that borders on obsession. Bibi becomes a symbol of everything wrong with Israel: corruption, illiberalism, tribalism, regression. Opposition to him becomes a marker of belonging for the Kaplanite. I call it Bibi derangement syndrome.

Ironically, this is probably the tribe I belong to most. My education, profession, and daily environment place me squarely in the Kaplanist world. I work with the AI labs, am involved in venture, and live and breathe the secular intellectual culture of Tel Aviv.

But my politics diverge from the median Kaplanist. But I understand my tribe from the inside: its anxieties, its assumptions, even when I disagree with its politics.",2,1771678452.0,IsraelPalestine,0,0.6,False

My plan is to build small paver patios and sit my raised beds on those. It will be a lot of work but if it keeps the invasive plants at bay, worth it. 

Now my only concern is adding drainage. I was considering making a couple of tubes out of hardware cloth, filling them with rocks and placing them inside the bed along the edges so that excess water can flow into them and out of the bed.

Many travelers end up visiting popular spots but leave feeling like they didn’t truly connect with local life.

That’s why I started **Hello Seoul** — a small pilot program that matches travelers with local Koreans for casual meetups. Instead of structured tours, it’s about relaxed conversations over coffee, visiting local-favorite restaurants, exploring neighborhoods locals actually hang out in, and sharing cultures naturally.

There’s no participation fee. Everyone simply pays for their own food or drinks, and you can coordinate schedules comfortably.

We’re currently in the pilot stage and have already successfully matched a few pairs who shared meaningful experiences and even made new friends.

If you’re planning to visit Seoul in March, feel free to join and experience Korea in a more personal way!

We’re also welcoming Korean locals who want to meet travelers, gain new perspectives, and have cross-cultural conversations — without having to travel abroad.

Since I personally match participants based on schedules and preferences, it may take a little time, but feel free to apply casually.

Guys… I’m still shaking but in a good way now?? It’s been like 2 day since the Great Balcony Betrayal and I’ve been avoiding the balcony like it’s radioactive. Every time I hear her door open I duck like I’m in a war zone. But yesterday morning I’m taking out the trash in full paranoid mode (hoodie up, eyes down) and boom — she’s right there at the bins too, holding a recycling bag, looking unfairly cute in oversized sunglasses.

She sees me, smiles this tiny, knowing smile and goes, “Hey… survived the heat wave?”

I freeze again (old habits die hard), face instantly tomato-red, and manage to squeak out, “Y-yeah… mostly. You?”

She laughs — not mean, just soft and warm — and says, “I’ve been wondering if you were ever coming back out. Thought maybe I scared you off forever.”

Internal screaming: SHE NOTICED I WAS HIDING.

But then she adds, quieter: “For what it’s worth… it was kinda funny. And honestly? Endearing. In a chaotic-puppy way.”

I died, resurrected, died again. Somehow my mouth says: “So… not moving to Antarctica then?”

She grins: “Not yet. But if you ever want to redeem yourself, I’m free this weekend. Coffee? Or a walk? No balconies required.”

I said yes so fast I almost choked on my own spit.

Tonight I’m gonna text her and actually ask her to go for that walk. Heart rate is already illegal. If she says yes I’m buying her the biggest gelato as apology + bribe. If she says no… well, I’ll just live in the hallway closet from now on.

1raqa93,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1raqa93/i_bid_you_entry/,I Bid You Entry,"The snow flurries were just beginning to flutter around as Lucas and I pushed through the arcade doors, the neon buzz and the sound of games fading behind us. Winter break had only just begun, and we’d already burned through half our money on Street Fighter and that busted pinball machine. My breath puffed out in white clouds the second we stepped onto the sidewalk, so I shoved my hands deeper into my jacket pockets. 

“Man, you really let that guy fuck you over with that combo spam,” Lucas jested, grinning like he’d just won the lottery instead of watching me lose for the third time in a row. He was walking a few paces behind me, snowflakes already catching in his dark hair. 

“Yeah, like you did much better,” I shot back, giving him a gentle shove. “At least I didn’t give up after the first round.” 

He laughed and fell into step beside me. The streetlights were just flickering on, their light brightening the snow like a fresh layer of glitter. Our town always got like this during the first real storm of the year—empty sidewalks and warm lights behind the curtains of each house. Oakwater was generally a peaceful place, and it had a kind of soul to it that made you forget about the outside world’s troubles. 

We cut down the side street toward home, the shortcut that shaved off a few blocks. Lucas had lived two doors down from me since second grade. As we walked, we started hearing voices and the metallic rattle of a spray can. In the alley between the laundromat and the old hardware store, a group was tagging the brick walls with crude pictures and writing R.I.P. to dead musicians. As we got closer, we could tell it was Brian Bishop and his crew, after all, who else would it be? 

We slowed without meaning to. Lucas’s grin faded. Brian was crouched, tagging the wall, while his buddies lounged against the other side laughing about something—probably girls, the way they always did when they thought no one important was listening. 

Lucas nudged me. “Keep walking, don’t stare.” 

But I couldn’t help it. Brian’s eyes flicked up and I swear he looked right at us. My stomach twisted as the rest of his crew followed his gaze and glared at us in silence as we passed. 

“Come on, man,” Lucas muttered, gesturing with his shoulder for me to pick up the pace. I didn’t want to deal with Brian’s bullshit anyway, so we put our heads down and kept going. 

Once we were farther down the street, Lucas sighed. “That dude’s always up to something. Remember last summer when he—” 

“Yeah,” I cut in, not wanting to relive Kolby’s milk carton incident or the fact that his dog went missing shortly after. “Dudes fucked up.” 

We walked in silence for a bit, the snow coming down in light flurries. Lucas elbowed me again, lighter this time. “Hey, you still thinking of asking Emme—Ellie—whatever—to the New Year’s thing?” 

“Emmeline,” I said. “And I don’t know, man. She’s cool but—” 

“Cool?” Lucas snorted. “I’ve seen you stare at her in English for months. Don’t be a coward, just ask her. Text her tonight, or maybe we’ll run into her at Books and Brew tomorrow. Worst case is she says no, then you’ll be embarrassed for five minutes before you get over it.” 

I rolled my eyes, but deep down I knew he wasn’t wrong. Lucas always made the things I worried about sound trivial. The snow kept falling quietly as we neared my house, Lucas’s place just in sight. 

He turned and kicked a little snow at me. “Alright, man, I’ll see you tomorrow.” That familiar smirk crossed his face. “And if you haven’t texted Emma by tomorrow, I’m forcing you to ask her in person.” 

“I haven’t even got her number yet,” I said, kicking a heavier puff of snow back at him. 

“Alright then, tomorrow we’ll get you that number and maybe that date too.” Lucas spun on his heels and headed down the lamplit street. 

The next morning, I woke up to see the snow falling steadily out the window. A clean three inches covered the yard—only Henry’s paw prints from his morning patrol broke it up. 

“Breakfast is ready!” Mom called from downstairs. I threw on jeans, a Nirvana shirt, and my blue pullover sweater, then headed down. The smell of bacon, eggs, and biscuits filled the kitchen. 

“Morning, Mom,” I said, taking my seat next to my sister Willow while she stole a slice of my bacon. 

“Thanks loser” Sneered Willow. 

Just as I started to speak up my mother interrupted, “The storm’s getting worse, Travis, so you two don’t go too far from home today. They’re calling for six inches by tonight.” 

I ate fast, then texted Lucas: Coming over. He replied with a thumbs up. 

Lucas was waiting on his porch when I got there, a red scarf around his shoulders and his Oakwater Catamounts varsity jacket on. “Let’s hit Books and Brew before they shut because of the storm.” 

We trudged through town, boots crunching in the thick snow. The streets were mostly cleared but the snow kept coming, leaving only a few cars moving slow. We messed around at Ralph’s gas station for a bit, flipping through magazines, then headed to the bookstore. 

The bell dinged as we walked in, the warm air and the smell of coffee and paper welcomed us in. Emmeline was in the mystery section, reading the back of a book with a bloody knife on the cover. She looked up and smiled, but before she could say anything, Lydia called out from behind the counter, “Welcome to Books and— Oh, hello boys! Come in for a cup to escape the cold?” 

Lucas headed toward Lydia and gave me a push toward Emmeline. I walked over, face already hot. “Hey Travis,” she said. “You come in to escape the snow too?”  

“Yeah, kinda. Me and Lucas were just hanging out, seeing which shops were still open.” 

She raised an eyebrow, “I didn’t take you for much of a reader.” 

I felt the lie forming, but her smile told me that she saw straight through it. “Okay, look,” I confessed. “Since you’re here, I might as well ask. Are you going to the New Year’s festival at the rec center?” 

She thought for a second, then I added, “If you want, maybe we could go together? I could get your number so I can text you the details tonight?” 

She bit her lip and held out her hand. “Sure.” We swapped numbers right there between the shelves. Her fingers brushed mine when she handed my phone back. “Text me tonight, and I’ll go if the storm doesn’t shut everything down.” 

We talked for a few minutes. She was reading The Shining, and thank God I’d seen the movie so I could pretend I read it too. Something in her demeanor told me she could see through that one too.  

Lucas and I left a little later, snowflakes sticking to our jackets. It was coming down in big, thick flurries now. We were too busy talking about playing video games when we got home, that I walked straight into a tall guy with long dark hair and a gothic-looking jacket. My shoulder slammed his chest and everything spilled out of my pockets; keys, coins, my crumpled New Year’s flyer. 

“Sorry,” I mumbled, crouching fast to grab it all. 

The guy didn’t step back. He bent down smoothly and picked up the flyer. His fingers brushed mine; they were ice cold. He read the paper, then handed it back with a small nod, his green eyes flat and emotionless. “New Year’s at the rec center, huh?” His voice was low and calm. “How quaint. Enjoy yourself, Travis.” 

He stood up and kept walking in the direction we’d come from. 

Lucas stared after him. “You know who that is, don’t you?” 

“Not a clue.” 

“That was Al. He’s the Arkwrights’ kid. You know that giant black manor on the edge of town?” 

“I didn’t even know anyone actually lived there. I thought it was some rich person’s vacation home.” 

“Well, it’s the Arkwrights,” Lucas said. “And you’re right, they’re rich as hell, but weirder still. Only time me and my dad saw them was at the town hall once, and they looked like they crawled straight out of a tomb.” 

I watched Al turn the corner, his coat flowing behind him in the falling snow. Lucas shoved my arm. “C’mon man, let’s get home. Those space bugs aren’t gonna kill themselves.” 

We split up at my house. I shook off the snow, went upstairs, and pulled out my phone. First text was to Emmeline: Hey Emma, this is Travis. So New Year’s festival in two days?” 

While I waited for the read receipt, I patted my pockets. Coins, flyer… no keys. Shit. 

Next text was to Lucas: Think I lost my keys when I bumped into that guy. Let me know if you see them anywhere. 

Lucas replied right away: Lmao, of course you did! Check the creepy rich boy’s house tomorrow if you can’t find them. Bet the weirdo took them. Now get your ass online and let’s get to killing! 

I stared at the screen. Emmeline hasn’t read my message yet, no sense in worrying about it now. I turned on my Xbox and Lucas and I spent the next few hours massacring aliens and robots long into the night. Outside my window the wind picked up, making the tree branch tap against the glass like the hand of a forest spirit checking if I was still awake. The storm wasn’t letting go yet. I just hoped it wouldn’t mess up the festival. 

I woke to a bright blade of sunlight cutting through my window, bouncing off the snow that was still falling in thick sheets. Judging by our nearly submerged flowerpot, we’d gotten those six inches and then some. My phone buzzed. It was Lucas. 

Lucas: Sorry dude, Mom and pops are making me do family stuff all day. Kill me? Lol jk, you good to hunt for that key on your own tho? 

I then sent Lucas back a quick yeah and went downstairs. Mom took one look at me, shook her head, and pointed to my winter coat on the rack. “You’re not going out without wearing all of this, do you hear me? And come back before dark, the roads are getting bad.” 

I pulled on the coat, scarf, and gloves, then stepped outside. The snow was already up past my ankles. I walked past Lucas’s house, turned left at the end of the street, and followed the road toward the old maple forest. Blackstone Manor sat right on the edge of town, nestled among the pines and maples like it had always been there. The whole place was built from dark basalt, tall and sharp, beautiful in it’s own chilling way. 

I climbed the steps and knocked on the big wooden red door. It took a long time before it opened. The butler stood there, tall and well kept, dressed in a spotless black suit with a crisp white shirt and white gloves. His hair was slicked back perfectly, thin glasses perched on his nose. He gave a small, elegant bow. 

“Master Travis Wilson,” he said, voice smooth and polished like he was reading from an old book. “How may I be of service this morning?” 

I blinked, I hadn’t told him my name yet. “Uh… I bumped into Al yesterday, and I think I dropped my house keys. Do you know if he maybe grabbed them?” 

The butler’s lips curved into the faintest smile, like he already knew every word I was going to say. “Of course. Please, I bid you entry, step inside the entry room while I inquire with the masters.” He held the door open just wide enough for me to pass, then closed it behind me with a soft, final click. 

The air inside was cold and still. On the wall in front of me hung a large oil painting: a tall man with his arm around a beautiful woman. Both of them stared straight out, faces blank and emotionless like those old Victorian portraits. Below it, carved neatly into the wood: Benedict and Levinia Arkwright. 

More portraits lined the hall. One in particular caught my eye, an oil painting of soldiers on a smoky battlefield, muskets flashing, bloodied bodies scattered in the grass. Engraved beneath it: Herkimer at the Battle of Oriskany. 

The butler returned without a sound, moving with an unfamiliar elegance. He stopped a perfect distance away and gave another small bow. 

“I regret to inform you,” he said, voice still calm and elegant, “that the Arkwrights are feeling rather ill today and will not be receiving any visitors.” His eyes met mine for a second too long, like he could see the questions I hadn’t asked yet. “Perhaps another time.” 

I swallowed. “Okay… um, where’s Al then?” 

“I believe Alistair had an affair to attend in town,” the butler replied, the same knowing smile flickering yet again. “Do have a safe walk home, Master Wilson. I'm afraid the storm isn’t quite finished with us yet.” 

I nodded defeatedly and stepped back outside. The door shut behind me with that same soft click. My phone buzzed in my pocket. 

Emma: Hey Travis! Sorry I fell asleep super early last night. I’d love to go to the festival with you tomorrow if the snow doesn’t cancel it! 

I grinned so hard, Fresh energy lit up inside of me, and I began picking up the pace back toward the bookstore and where I ran into Al yesterday. 

I cut through the alley behind the hardware store—the same one Brian’s crew had tagged. The town was dead quiet except for the wind, and that’s when I heard it; A low, slow groan, like someone was trying to breathe through broken glass. 

I froze, the sound echoing between the tagged brick walls. It sounded wrong, like someone in deaths stone cold grasp, sending shivers down my spine. 

I took one careful step deeper into the alley and peeked around the dumpster. A figure was hunched over in the snow, blond hair and a basketball jacket. It looked like Brian Bishop, kneeling there with his shoulders shaking but the shadows were too strong to really tell. Another groan ripped out of him and I could swear in that instant I saw a dark figure standing tall at the end of the alley. 

I didn’t wait to see anything else, I spun around and ran. Boots slipping, nearly falling on my ass as I turned the corner. My heart was slamming, the groan still ringing in my ears like it was chasing me all the way home. I didn’t stop until I burst through the front door, kicked off my boots, and grabbed my phone with shaking hands. 

Willow was sitting on the couch watching tv when I entered. She turned to me and shouted, “Hey dipshit try the doorknob next time!” 

“Yeah, whatever.” I quickly disregarded her before running my way to my room upstairs. First, I texted Lucas: Dude something fucked up just happened. I went to the manor, no keys, then on the way back I heard this creepy groan in the alley and I swear it was fucking Brian kneeling there in pain, and just as I began to run I swear to God I saw a someone at the end of the alley! 

Lucas replied fast: Shit man, that’s messed up. Also, mom won’t let me leave till the storms over now... Just stay inside, and I’ll sneak over tomorrow if I can. 

I stared at the screen, then opened a new text to Emmeline: Hey Emma, something really weird just happened on my way home. I could have sworn I saw Brian groaning in the alley they usually hang out in. Have you heard anything?  

Hours went by without a reply. Lucas was busy, so I couldn’t game with him to keep my mind straight, so I basked in my anxious theories until the dusk began to set. That's when my phone finally lit up, it was Emma.  

Emma: I’m fine, Travis. And don’t worry about Brian, he’s a dumb jerk.  I had some things come up today, and I'm pretty tired now. See you tomorrow night at the festival? Also, have you ever noticed how beautiful the snow falling by the streetlight is at night? 

I read it twice. Something about the message felt off, but I couldn’t put my finger on why. The snow kept falling outside, heavier than ever now. I replied: Yeah, it is really pretty. Okay, see you tomorrow then, hopefully it’s not canceled. Goodnight. 

The next morning the storm was somehow worse. Snow blew sideways past my window in thick white clouds, piling up against the house like it wanted to bury us alive. I grabbed my phone and texted Lucas and Emma the same thing: Good morning. Storm’s insane out there. 

Lucas replied right away: Yeah no kidding. Stuck inside all day again. You? 

Emma didn’t answer. 

I spent the rest of the morning and most of the afternoon on the couch with Mom and Willow, flipping through channels while the wind howled outside. Mom kept saying, “Nobody’s going anywhere today. The festival’s canceled and the roads are closed until all this blows over.” Willow kept stealing the remote and calling me a couch potato every time I checked my phone. 

I texted Lucas a couple times. He answered, and Emma still hadn’t. 

Around midday I sent her another one: Hey Emma, you okay? Festival’s canceled.. Maybe we can just get some lunch together to make up for it? 

It was delivered, but she hadn’t opened it. 

A couple more hours dragged by, and still nothing. The sun was already setting behind the forest outline when my phone buzzed with a text from a number I didn’t know. 

The message read as follows: “127 Kettle Brook Road, Oakwater VT.” A few lines beneath it was a short message. :  It’s Emma. Sneak over,, I need you. 

My stomach flipped. I texted back fast: Emma? You alright? Whose phone is this? 

No reply. 

I went downstairs and tried to sound casual, forming an aliby as I went. “Mom, can I just run over to Lucas’s for a bit? I’ll be quick.” 

She didn’t even look up from the TV. “Absolutely not. It’s dark, and hells freezing over outside. You’re staying here tonight, alright?” 

Willow butted in from the couch. “Dork.” 

I went back upstairs, getting more anxious by the minute.  I texted Lucas everything: Some random number just texted me saying it’s Emma and to sneak over. She hasn’t answered her own phone all day, so I’m thinking she’s in trouble. I’m going. 

Lucas: Dude don’t be a psycho, you’ll freeze out there. Wait till tomorrow. 

But I couldn’t. I texted Emma one more time at her actual number: “You okay?” but it didn’t even deliver this time. 

I pulled on every layer I owned, opened my window, and carefully slipped out, shutting it before sliding down. The drop was farther than I thought, I hit the snow pretty hard, buried within what must be two feet of snow. It muffled my groan as the impact knocked the breath out of me. My side ached like hell but I got up and started moving, brushing the snow from my face. The address was only three streets past Lucas’. I can do this.  

The wind began screaming in my ears, snow hitting my face like thin needles, and I had to keep my head down the whole way, fighting through drifts that tried to swallow my legs. If I hadn’t bundled up I would’ve frozen solid in minutes. 

After about fifteen minutes or so I finally made it to the address; all the lights were on and both cars were in the driveway. This must be Emma’s house, thank God. I knocked on the front door, but no answer. After a minute or two I knocked louder, but still nothing. I rose my fist to knock again, but then I swore I heard something from inside, a thud maybe. 

“Emma? Is anyone home?” I shouted, wondering if anyone could even hear me over the storm.  

I went around back and noticed that one of the second-floor windows was open, the curtains flapping in the wind like they were waving me in. I shouted, “Emma!” To no answer. 

I made my way to the back door, and noticied that there were no tracks in the yard other than mine. I nestled the doorknob and it was unlocked, and with a gently push it came open, snow instantly flowing in through the crack. I stepped inside. 

A thin trail of blood led around the corner, and I felt the fear begin seeping deep inside of me. “Hello? Is anyone home?” I Shouted to no reply. Hesitantly, I began following it, and the blood got thicker fast. Around the corner in the kitchen I found who could have only been Emma’s dad on the floor beside an overthrown table. His throat was viciously torn open with deep gashes and tears, blood pooled into a dark crimson lake under his still body. 

Just as I could take in the horrific scene I heard the most unsettling noise I could have possibly heard; a horrid wet squelching sound was coming from up the stairs. 

“Emma!” I yelled, my voice cracking with fear. “Emma!” 

I grabbed the biggest kitchen knife I could find off the counter and made my way to the stairs. A fresh trail of blood could be seen trickling down the steps from the top, slow and steady. I gripped the knife tighter and kept shouting her name, fear crawling up my throat. The higher up I walked, the more blood ran down each step, and the sounds only got more disturbing; a slurping sound, then a grunt, followed by more wet noises. 

As I reached the top, the source of the blood was made clear as it gushed form under the cracked bathroom door, the smell of iron and death became all too overbearing. 

Fear pounded on my heart as I reached my free hand over to the doorknob and tightened my grip on the knife with the other. A concoction of terror and dread took over my shaking voice as I whispered, “Emma…” and pushed the door open. 

Her mom was on the floor, twitching and barely alive. Emma sat there in a pool of scarlet ichor, kneeling over her. Her beautiful blonde hair was not mostly splattered in blood, clothes soaked, hands dripping. Her eyes that were once a calming brown were now red with the fury of hell itself, and gazed directly into mine like a predator sizing it’s prey. She slowly tilted her head from her mothers neck, blood dripping from her lips and chin. 

For a moment a strange feeling flooded my chest, a feeling of divine love, like I would do absolutely anything she wanted me too. She licked her lips clean and stood up slowly, raising an open bloodied palm toward me.  

“Come to me, Travis,” she said softly, her voice almost serenely sweet. “Let me keep you warm forever.” 

Terror hit me like a freight train. I dropped the knife and turned to run but my foot slipped in the thick pool of blood, slamming my temple into the wall next to the door as I fell. Pain exploded behind my eyes, and everything went blurry. 

Emma knelt down and cradled me in her arms. She leaned in and licked the fresh gash on my forehead, slow and gentle. “Shh… don’t be afraid.” Amid the terror her voice was somehow calming. 

She licked the gash in my head again. My vision came and went as I was desperately clinked on to consciousness. Her head twitched, and I could see deep cuts in Emmas neck before she began stretching her mouth wider than it humanly should have, long savage fangs dripping with dark red. 

She sank them into my neck, and soon I could feel nothing. It was almost peaceful, laying there in her arms. The world started to fade, and the last thing I saw through the tangled mess of her blonde bloody hair was a tall, dark figure standing in the hallway, smiling like the world was his. 

And then there was nothing.

1raq9x6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1raq9x6,Pay to Brag: When Professional Membership Becomes an Expensive Hobby,"There is a peculiar modern pastime among professionals: collecting memberships the way previous generations collected porcelain figurines. Only now the figurines cost hundreds — sometimes thousands — of pounds a year and come with a password to a members’ portal instead of a glass cabinet.

Across business, marketing, law and “thought leadership”, organisations such as the [Virtual Advisory Board (VAB)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/virtual-advisory-board-vab/), the [IPA (Institute of Practitioners in Advertising)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/theipa/), the [CIM | The Chartered Institute of Marketing](https://www.linkedin.com/school/chartered-institute-of-marketing/), the [Institute of Directors (IoD)](https://www.linkedin.com/school/institute-of-directors/), the American Institute of Certified Board Advisors and the [Practising Law Institute (PLI)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/practising-law-institute/) all sell variations on the same promise: join us, and you will be better connected, better trained and faintly more impressive at dinner parties.

What they sell most reliably, however, is the right to say you belong.

Let’s talk about money, because humour works best when the numbers do the heavy lifting. Annual membership fees range from the politely annoying to the genuinely theatrical. The IPA will take about £240 a year for an associate subscription. CIM starts lower for students and junior marketers but rises as your career does. The Virtual Advisory Board advertises an annual fee in US dollars, plus a joining fee that feels suspiciously like a velvet rope. The American Institute for Certified Board Advisors charges annual dues in the low hundreds of dollars. And the Practising Law Institute offers an “unlimited” individual membership at several thousand dollars a year — which is either terrific value or the financial equivalent of buying an all-you-can-eat buffet when you only fancy a salad.

Here is what those headline prices look like when converted to pounds and placed side by side: See images at the top

Once the shock wears off, the natural question is: what exactly are you buying?

Membership benefits tend to arrive in four neat parcels: networking, learning, tools and status.

Networking is always described as “exclusive”. In practice, it often means a quarterly breakfast with name badges, tepid coffee and a room full of people who joined for exactly the same reason you did: to meet someone more useful than themselves. Sometimes this works and turns into business. More often it turns into [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/linkedin/) connections and a card in a drawer labelled “follow up (never)”.

Learning usually appears as webinars, short courses and digital libraries. Some of it is genuinely good. A surprising amount looks like material you could find free on [YouTube](https://www.linkedin.com/company/youtube/), or for the price of a paperback. The marketing copy is heroic: “cutting-edge insights”, “practical frameworks”, “world-class faculty”. The lived experience can be a PowerPoint, a talking head and a Q&A dominated by one man with a niche problem about procurement.

Tools and templates sound useful until you open them. “Board evaluation toolkit” is impressive until you discover it is a Word document that asks, “How did the board perform this year?” with a box underneath. It is not that these resources are useless — it is that they are rarely worth what you paid for the right to download them.

And then there is status. This is the silent product and possibly the most profitable. Letters after your name. A badge on your website. A logo in your email signature. These cost almost nothing to produce and are extraordinarily good at soothing professional insecurity. Whether they mean anything depends entirely on who is looking at them. To an insider, they may signal competence. To everyone else, they look like decorative punctuation.

The uncomfortable truth is that membership bodies do not sell guaranteed outcomes. They sell access to the *possibility* of outcomes. That is not a scam; it is a business model. The promise is always carefully worded: opportunities, communities, resources. Never “clients”, “jobs” or “profit”. It is like buying a gym membership and being surprised you are still unfit while sitting on the sofa eating crisps (Chips in the US). The organisation can always say — quite reasonably — that the equipment was available.

This is how waste creeps in. Many professionals join on a wave of optimism and then quietly forget they are members. The renewal email arrives. They sigh. They pay again. It is the Netflix of professional development: theoretically rich, practically underused.

The pattern is global. Bodies such as the [Project Management Institute](https://www.linkedin.com/company/projectmanagementinstitute/) or the [American Bar Association](https://www.linkedin.com/company/american-bar-association/) operate on the same logic: fees in exchange for learning, networking and professional standing. For some people — lawyers who consume continuous legal education, project managers earning certification points — this makes cold financial sense. For many others, it becomes a subscription to good intentions.

Now, a word for any paid members preparing to write an indignant email: yes, your membership *helped you*. Congratulations. If you volunteered, spoke at events, joined committees and actively mined the network, you turned membership into a machine. You did the work. But if you are the sort who pays annually, enjoys the logo and treats renewal like council tax, do not be shocked when an article suggests you may be funding a lifestyle accessory rather than a business tool.

The higher the fee, the more heroic the justification must be. For a lawyer who consumes training material weekly, a high-priced PLI subscription may be cheaper than buying courses individually. For someone who logs in twice a year, it becomes a luxury guilt-purchase. For a young marketer, a CIM membership might open doors. For a senior one with an established network, it can become a decorative expense. For a board adviser, an AICBA credential might reassure clients — or it might simply reassure the adviser.

None of this makes these organisations villains. Many provide real value: helplines, standards, lobbying, serious training. The problem is not fraud; it is inertia. Membership is easy to buy and surprisingly hard to measure. Benefits are diffuse. Costs are precise. The human brain is very good at believing that something *might* be useful, which is much nicer than admitting it isn’t.

Professional membership has become a form of aspirational spending. We are not buying services so much as buying the idea of a better version of ourselves: more connected, more informed, more legitimate. The danger is mistaking the receipt for the transformation.

The real comedy is that the strongest value often comes from the least advertised part: involvement. Committees, panels, working groups and speaking slots turn passive membership into active opportunity. But that requires time, effort and social bravery — which undermines the fantasy that value can be downloaded.

So are these memberships a waste of money? Sometimes. Not because they offer nothing, but because they offer things most people never use. A logo is easy. A webinar is easy. A network that turns into work is hard.

Memberships can be brilliant. They can also be expensive paperweights. Choose which one you are buying — and don’t be surprised if someone laughs gently when they see the badge on your website and asks what it actually did for you.

Story ch1394 add-on:  
Melissa had already become a Beyonder and stepped into the mysterious world her brother once kept hidden from her. The more she learned, the more fragments of the past resurfaced.
She sat in the living room, holding a spring watch in her palm. She remembered how Klein could never quite repair it, how he would scratch his head awkwardly before asking for her help.
Her lips curved unconsciously, but beneath that gentle smile lingered a trace of sorrow that refused to fade.
After a while, she rose and tied her hair back. She had decided to make Klein’s favorite stew tonight—adding more spices than usual, even paprika.
Realizing she lacked a few ingredients, she put on her coat and hat before heading toward the market.  

In a Backlund coffee shop, Leonard Mitchell sat by the window, a cup of black tea resting near his hand.
He had been summoned to Backlund by the Church for a minor assignment. Yet, in truth, he was using this quiet interlude to compose poems dedicated to “Him.”
His green eyes were lowered as he wrote, the nib of his pen moving steadily.
Melissa, walking along the street, happened to glimpse the familiar profile through the café window. For a moment, she hesitated.
She recognized him.
He had been her brother’s close colleague—perhaps even his closest friend.
Taking a soft breath, she approached the entrance.
“Excuse me… May I ask you something?” she said calmly.
Leonard looked up. The young lady before him wore a white, intricately layered dress and a wide straw hat adorned with delicate ornaments.
His pupils contracted slightly.
Klein’s sister.
For a fleeting instant, complex emotions flickered through his eyes before settling into a polite smile.
“How can I help you?” He gestured to the seat opposite him, indicating she was not interrupting anything important.
Melissa adjusted her skirt and sat down. The atmosphere grew subtly awkward, as if both were waiting for the other to pierce through the silence.
She introduced herself and asked whether he remembered Klein Moretti.
Leonard’s smile softened.
“Of course,” he replied gently. “He is a close friend of mine.”
Melissa’s fingers tightened slightly atop the table. She could hear something deeper beneath those words.
Leonard could not help recalling the day he delivered the news in Tingen—the sorrowful household, the forced composure. Back then, he had been the messenger of tragedy.
“Would you like something to drink?” he offered, attempting to ease the heaviness in the air.
“No, thank you. I won’t take much of your time.”
She lifted her gaze and asked directly, “I want to know the truth about my brother.”
Leonard studied her quietly before asking, “You’ve become a Beyonder?”
Melissa nodded.
There was no longer any point in concealing the obvious. With her current understanding of mysticism, she could easily connect the chain of events that once seemed accidental.
“Yes,” Leonard admitted at last. “Klein became a Beyonder back then.”
He paused briefly before continuing in a steady voice:
“In his final moments, he saved Tingen.”
He did not elaborate further. Some secrets were not meant to be spoken lightly.
Melissa lowered her head, staring at the grain of the wooden table as she digested the revelation. Her gaze inadvertently fell upon the sheet of paper before Leonard.
“The Fool…” she murmured unconsciously.
Realizing her lapse, she straightened in embarrassment. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to pry.”
Leonard did not respond immediately. Instead, a subtle intuition stirred within him—this encounter did not feel like mere coincidence.
He looked at her and said slowly, “Your brother… is beside Him.”
After a brief hesitation, he added, “If you ever need anything, you may call His name.”
He tore off a small piece of paper and handed it to her. Written upon it was an honorific name.
Night fell quietly.
Melissa sat at the edge of her bed, the paper resting in her hands. Moonlight seeped through the curtains, pale and tranquil.
After a long silence, she began to recite:
“The Fool that doesn’t belong to this era…
The mysterious ruler above the gray fog…
The King of Yellow and Black who wields good luck…”
Her voice trembled slightly at first but gradually steadied.
As the final line faded, the air before her subtly distorted. From the void emerged a tentacle, gentle and unreal, its tip adorned with a golden flower.
It extended toward her slowly, without malice—only quiet acknowledgment.
Melissa’s breath caught.
She recognized that flower.
A gentle smile was drawn on her face as she understood.
Her older brother was watching over her.

1raq7s3,https://i.redd.it/8lqmqpjofukg1.jpeg,End of year reflections from a run coach (full time for the last 19 years),"Hey friends,

My name’s Kyle Long. I’ve interacted with some of you here and try to provide some helpful words when and where I can. I tossed this into a few ultra running subs a few weeks and it was super well received and seemed to help a lot of people, so figured I’d post it here as well with in case it can be of value to anyone. 

I’ve been a run coach/sports performance specialist full time for the last 19 years (and am a mediocre ultra runner myself). At the end of each calendar year, I always spend a little time reflecting back on things I’ve seen from my previous year of coaching. What worked well, what didn’t, what was interesting to me etc etc and I figured it might be something worth sharing here. I throw out a fair amount of words here, so feel free to give me the finger and scroll right by lol

To some, a lot of this may sound like common sense and that’s ok, for others, I hope it maybe can answer questions you’ve had or validate thoughts you’ve had. I scroll through here each week and see what’s asked often and think some of my bullet points will touch on some frequently discussed things.

A quick run down of my athlete base so you have context for my points: I work primarily with people who are just looking to enjoy trail running and ultras, not have them destroy their body and have the training fit life. Not to say my runners don’t train hard or chase big things, I had folks bring home finished at Moab, UTMB TDS and dozens of other big 50k-100 milers. But what I do not work much with are athletes who are chasing a 14hr 100, a 2:15 marathon, a podium at Leadville etc. I make that distinguishing statement because different training methodologies and concepts fit different archetypes and my reflections below won’t all fit the more elite/sub-elite types.

Onto my thoughts (I’ll keep them condensed, but feel free to ask for elaborations or questions you have on any of the points).

You can cover big distances on low(er) mileage. If I averaged out all my 100 mile athletes, their peak weeks would settle around 60-65 miles. Over almost 20 years of coaching, I’ve seen a better success rate of 100 mile/100k finishers in my athlete type utilizing well built, progress back to back efforts vs huge overall weekly mileage. The only times I’ve ever programmed a 100+ mile week in my entire career were for my folks chasing 200 mile+ objectives. With that, you can see how that can scale down a lot to more traditional distances and that 100 mile weeks aren’t a requirement for a good day out at a a marathon/50k etc like some people believe. 

Strength work is a massive advantage, first and foremost from an injury prevention standpoint. I push all of my people to spend time on strength work and build programs that integrate well into their run work, but not for the most obvious reasons. There is of course a performance perspective, especially those training for big terrain objectives who are stuck in the flatlands, but the rate of decline in ankle/knee/hip/posterior chain injuries I see is absolutely, directly correlated to how well people follow their strength programs. You can get the barebones of what you need in 2-3, half hour sessions a week, so don’t say you don’t have time.

A jump off point from the above is that INTENSITY MATTERS. If your strength work is solely focused on helping you as a runner (as opposed to a big focus on aesthetics etc) then it should rarely leave you feeling so crushed that it affects your run work negatively. Fight the urge to “goggins” your way through the gym. It’s a long arc, treat it that way. Work over long, progressive, slow building arcs. If you’re so sore you can’t get out for your runs the next day, you probably need to make some tweaks (but not cut it out completely).

Nutrition REALLY matters. I’m personally guilty of fueling 8 hour training days on some sour patch kids and a dream, but then I married a sports nutritionist and realized I probably was being an idiot. I don’t live and die by the calorie/macro now, but I made some low hanging fruit changes to my days and my fueling that on their own have increased my capacity to train massively. Something as simple as “I drink a big bottle of water first thing before I make my coffee”, “once a quarter I track a few days of eating to make sure I’m at least generally close on my macros” to being slightly more mindful in how I fuel my training days. I was getting by on garbage nutrition but a slightly less bit of garbage has really gone a long way. TLDR: it didn’t take a massive overhaul to make an impact on the fueling front.

Make sure you have plans but let your heart adjust them. I’ve seen some of my athletes get married to a race schedule that they fall out of love with, and it really damages their relationship with running. At the end of the day, 99% of us are doing this because we love it and we want to do it as long as possible. The rate at which you can become resentful towards running is scary fast if you end up forcing yourself into efforts you don’t truly want to be a part of. Social media can suck and there’s so much grandstanding out there that it’s important to remember you only are seeing your people’s best. Be whatever version of a runner your heart and mind wants, and that can change year to year, even month to month. Want to go long? Go long. Want to spend the fall getting fast for a marathon? Do that. Want to go do stuff in the mountains? Cool to do it. Just don’t get too hung up on being one type of “thing” simply because you’ve been that thing before.

Sleep. I’ve seen countless athletes of mine try to tough-guy their way through on 4-5 hours of sleep. I won’t go into all the science and reasoning behind it, but I’ll just say that it is night and day in terms of performance and mental health for my people who consistently get the sleep they need vs those who don’t. It’s not woo-woo hippie stuff and it’s easy to say but even easier to neglect. Create healthy sleep habits and you’ll see your recovery and performance go through the roof.

That’s generally what I felt could be helpful to hear here. I hope you all have a great spring of training and races and do some epic stuff. Feel free to comment questions, I’ll try to answer them all over the weekend to expand upon anything folks may want to learn about.

That's me. Tired, at a desk. It's from my e-diary, made with an AI image generator. The first time I'd ever created something visual that captured what I felt. Grainy black and white, the only colour a purple glow on my coffee cup.



[Tired Adam at his desk in grainy black and white, coffee cup lit by purple light.](https://preview.redd.it/eylboto6bukg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2bb798d23880514fe11bfd421c843a8d178f75f9)



I'm a middle manager in a corporate operational role. My job is to follow processes. I don't create anything. Most days the gap between what I'm capable of and what I'm allowed to do feels crushing. So I started writing an e-diary. Not for anyone else. Just a place to process what work wouldn't give me room to feel. I've always enjoyed drawing and painting, but I have no talent for it. Then DALL-E was integrated into ChatGPT in October 2023, and something shifted. I typed a prompt. Something I'd imagined appeared on screen. For the first time, I could create visually. That feeling is addictive.

I'm not the only one with nowhere to put that energy. This is where I put mine.



|**What**|**Total (8 months)**|
|:-|:-|
|**ChatGPT Pro ($200/mo)**|**\~$800**|
|**Google AI Ultra ($250/mo)**|**\~$1,000**|
|**Replicate (image APIs)**|**$347**|
|**OpenAI (DALL-E, API)**|**$275**|
|[**fal.ai**](http://fal.ai) **(image APIs)**|**$175**|
|**Midjourney**|**\~$240**|
|**Leonardo**|**\~$240**|
|**ChatGPT Plus (DALL-E access)**|**$160**|
|**Other image tools**|**\~$200**|



**Image tools total: \~$3,400.** One workflow. Nearly a dozen bills. None of them talked to each other. The average creator is already on about [$66 a month across roughly four AI subscriptions](https://bango.com/its-not-a-bubble-over-three-quarters-say-their-ai-subscriptions-are-now-essential-to-everyday-life/). I'd gone deeper, and the bill had gone further.

I tried to fix it. Built a workflow that auto-upsampled prompts and routed them across models. Five variants from one prompt felt magical. Then I looked at the results. More options, but the same outputs failing in different ways. Wrong model for the job, or the prompt just didn't land. The aggregators that exist today don't tell you which model is best for what. None of them adapt your prompt so it works for each model.

That's the trap: subscribe to one and accept its limits, or subscribe to everything and do all the work yourself. That's why Synfuse is pay-when-you-create.

# The Dialect Problem

I was following best practices for prompt writing. Reference high-end cameras, add detail, be specific. ""Shot on Leica M6"" should make a model recall the lens character, colour profile, and depth of field. Most models handle it perfectly.

Then I tried Z-Image Turbo. Same prompt. It put an actual Leica M6 in the scene: a product shot of the camera sitting on a messy kitchen counter with flour, cookies, and bowls. It interpreted ""shot on Leica M6"" literally.



[Z-Image Turbo took “shot on Leica M6” literally and put the camera in the scene on a messy kitchen counter with flour, cookies, and bowls.](https://preview.redd.it/gs2hqkwadukg1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd589ff048f6e23ae2bb852646c51921b2834a04)



I dug into the research. A [MIT/Stanford/Columbia study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14333) found that automatically rewriting prompts with an LLM, the default behaviour in tools like DALL-E 3, [degrades results by about 58%](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/study-generative-ai-results-depend-user-prompts-much-models). Roughly half of the quality improvement in AI images comes from how the prompt is adapted for that specific model, not the model itself.

Each model has its own dialect. **What** works for Midjourney breaks FLUX. What works for DALL-E confuses Z-Image Turbo. A technique that's ""best practice"" for one model actively sabotages another. It's like ordering coffee in Paris, Tokyo, and Rome at once: use the wrong language in the wrong place and you get a stare, not a latte. The tools are capable. We're just speaking the wrong language to them.

Nobody had connected all of this. Not the routing, the dialect adaptation, and the multi-model scoring together in one place. Some platforms let you pick from their own models. Some enhance your prompt generically. None of them do both across models from competing providers, model-agnostic, and score every output against what you actually asked for. I couldn't find anyone who had. I built it anyway.

# So I Built Synfuse

$3,400 taught me the problem. Building the fix cost more.



|**What**|**Total (8 months)**|
|:-|:-|
|**Replit (AI coding)**|**$19,757**|
|**Cursor**|**$633**|
|**Perplexity**|**$390**|
|**Firecrawl**|**$319**|
|**Claude**|**$250**|
|**Other**|**\~$575**|



**Build tools total: \~$21,900. Combined with the image tools: \~$25,300 in eight months.** The Replit number catches people. I'm not a developer.

Replit, Cursor, and Claude turned someone who could only follow the playbook into someone who could build what was in his head. Under the hood, two AI agents work together. The Fuse Agent talks to you, understands what you want, and maintains context across the conversation. The Director Agent handles the technical side: model selection, prompt optimisation, and routing. Each model in the system goes through a 12-stage enrichment pipeline that maps its strengths, weaknesses, optimal prompt patterns, and failure modes. The Director doesn't just pick a model. It picks the right model and writes a prompt specifically for that model's dialect. Not a generic rewrite, but a translation. Model-agnostic, not locked to one provider's ecosystem. Hard to build. I couldn't find anyone who had wired all of it together. Describe what you want, and the system handles the rest.

I asked for a moss-covered stone cottage in a misty forest with a stream. Synfuse ran five models at once. The winner was FLUX.2 Max, a model most people have never heard of, at 95%.

Same words, five completely different outputs. The screenshot shows the scores. Synfuse uses AI to analyse each output against your original request, score how closely it matched, and pick the winner.



[Synfuse comparison: five models ran the same prompt; FLUX.2 Max scored 95&#37; and won, with Imagen 4 Ultra, Qwen, Z-Image Turbo, and Imagen 4 Fast below.](https://preview.redd.it/9xmz2qshdukg1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c8985d0d0c441dd45a4d423b3df9cd7f980f259)



""Best overall"" hides what matters: which model is best *for this specific request*? The best model for anime isn't the best model for portraits. Rankings shift by category. That's what Synfuse is for. And if a smaller AI lab has a model that's genuinely the best fit for what you asked for, Synfuse will find it and route to it. Not because they have the biggest marketing budget, but because they have the best output. That's not charity. That's how it should work.

I don't want to build a company that runs on exploitation. I want to build one that runs on enrichment. The best model for the job wins, not the biggest company.

# What This Is Really About

That e-diary I started as a coping mechanism? It's full of Synfuse-generated images now. A single image that captures how I felt on a given day. Created in seconds, using a model I didn't have to choose and a prompt I didn't have to engineer.



[Synfuse-generated e-diary image: casual shot on the bed with warm window light and film grain.](https://preview.redd.it/jkkawlridukg1.jpg?width=832&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28e9092a44f3caf1c492d196ba8e7e988b2ebe3d)

  
I had no training, no talent for visual art, nowhere at work to put my ideas. AI image generation didn't replace my creativity. It unlocked it. I built Synfuse because these tools work. They just need to be wired together.

If you've felt that squeeze, I built this for people like us.

I am 38F and just began talk- therapy for the first time in Jan. I should have started seeing a mental health professional a very long time ago and my quality of life has suffered from it. She said there is a place for meds in my treatment and Dx me with GAD plus moderate depression and possible BPD/cPTSD

I have been anxious ever since I was a little girl and started dealing with mild depression off/on as a teenager but this went mostly ignored for my life— I also have endured a lot of trauma. I grew up in a confusing chaotic environment , to be vague, and it’s been a long road of hyperfixated fears, obsessing, social anxiety/struggles, and I now as a grown woman am coming to terms with the difficulties I have had over the last several years with my confidence, making friends, advancing my career, having a harmonious relationship with my partner and just feeling a general sense of well-being and fulfillment.  I am dealing with depression/irritability, hyper-vigilance, low motivation, brain fog, panic attacks, and I just need a way out of this cycle.

So… back to the Zoloft. I’m afraid to take the plunge. I’m worried any of these side effects will be so hard for me to deal with. I’m fully informed and ready to take the risk but I don’t want to derail myself. Are there any tips or lessons learned you guys can give me from when you started the drug?

Thank you and I’m looking forward to hopefully feeling better.

My perspective comes from observing the atmosphere around a recent [Sytner Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sytner-group/) gathering — part of [Penske Automotive Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/penskeautomotive/) — held at a [Marriott Hotels](https://www.linkedin.com/company/marriott_hotels_resorts/) in Leicester, and from conversations I overheard among attendees in the lounge area during breaks. This is opinion and observation, shaped by years around similar corporate events — not a claim about what was actually said on stage.

Sometimes, what’s said over lukewarm coffee between sessions tells you far more about “culture” than anything delivered from a lectern.

# The Visible Cost — And the Very British Question: “Was It Worth It?”

Even from the sidelines, the scale of the day was hard to ignore. Rough estimates based on what was visible:

* Conference room hire: **£2,000**
* Catering for roughly 120 people at £40 a head: **£4,800**
* Around 100 hotel rooms at £110 each: **£11,000**

That’s at least **£17,800** before travel, salaries, lost revenue, and the cost of taking dozens of commercially focused staff away from their actual jobs.

British workplace culture tends to be quietly pragmatic. We might not stand up and shout “this is a waste of money”, but we absolutely do the maths in our heads while pretending to be fascinated by a croissant.

And here’s the awkward bit: most people already know that sitting through hours of slide-led presentations isn’t how adults actually absorb information. People remember conversations, not bullet points — which makes you wonder why so many organisations still design events around long stretches of passive listening.

# I’ve Seen This Before — [BT Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bt/) , [dixons](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dixons/), [Yell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yell/) and the Corporate Roadshow Circuit

This isn’t unique to one organisation. Having worked within large blue-chip companies such as [BT Group](https://www.linkedin.com/company/bt/) and [dixons](https://www.linkedin.com/company/dixons/) , [Yell](https://www.linkedin.com/company/yell/) the pattern feels remarkably familiar.

The reactions across departments are almost predictable:

* **Senior management** genuinely believe these events are effective. Visibility equals leadership.
* **Marketing teams** thrive on them — staging the experience, crafting the messaging, producing the merchandise. It becomes part brand campaign, part internal theatre.
* **Finance** quietly calculate the spend, look for tax angles, and wonder whether the return exists anywhere beyond a spreadsheet.
* **IT teams** sit there asking the question nobody else wants to raise: *“Is there something wrong with the email or intranet?”*

None of this is malicious. But it does show how these gatherings can isolate functions rather than unite them — each department experiencing a completely different version of the same “culture”.

# What You Hear Outside the Room (Where the Real Meeting Happens)

If you want to understand organisational culture, don’t listen to the keynote — listen to the lounge.

Across many corporate gatherings, the off-stage conversations tend to follow a familiar rhythm:

* Polite agreement in public, gentle eye-rolling in private.
* Jokes about buzzwords that nobody challenges on a microphone.
* Questions about why the same people always seem to get the spotlight.
* A quiet sense of “right… back to the real work tomorrow then.”

None of this proves anything about the specific presentations. But it reveals how employees interpret leadership once the performance ends — and interpretation is where trust either grows or quietly erodes.

# When “Culture” Feels a Bit… Performed

From the outside, gatherings like this can look less like collaboration and more like corporate theatre: leaders on stage, rows of chairs, a carefully managed narrative.

British workplaces tend to value understatement and authenticity. So when events feel overly polished or heavily scripted, the reaction isn’t always enthusiasm — sometimes it’s polite scepticism delivered through dry humour.

You can almost hear the collective internal monologue:

>“Lovely slides. Shame about the humanity.”

People rarely leave these events discussing the numbers in detail. What sticks is the atmosphere — whether it felt genuine or staged — and if the delivery feels flat or overly corporate, that emotional aftertaste lingers far longer than any performance chart.

# Visibility Is Not Community (Even If There’s a Very Large Screen Behind You)

Leadership visibility is often used to justify large gatherings. The assumption is simple: bring everyone together, put senior figures on stage, deliver the message, and unity will follow.

But visibility alone does not create community — particularly in a UK context, where respect tends to come from approachability rather than performance.

When speakers appear dull, overly rehearsed or buried in figures, the room may stay quiet — but quiet does not mean engaged. It often just means British politeness at work.

Figure-heavy presentations might reassure boards and investors, but they rarely inspire staff. Strategy delivered as a monologue can feel dictated rather than shared. A stage elevates leaders physically; without genuine interaction, it can widen the gap between leadership and everyone else.

People don’t build trust because someone stood under bright lights and told them the plan. They build trust when they feel part of the conversation — and that rarely happens from the back row of a conference suite.

# A Tale of Two Cultures: American Energy Meets British Scepticism

Here’s where things become subtly awkward.

American corporate culture often embraces bold messaging, visible celebration and high-energy delivery. British corporate culture leans towards modesty, dry humour and quiet competence.

When an American parent company oversees a British organisation, a culture clash can emerge — not because either side is wrong, but because expectations differ.

What feels motivational in the US can feel over-produced or slightly insincere to a UK audience. Meanwhile, British restraint can appear underwhelming to American leadership.

The result? A room that politely applauds while privately wondering when the motivational seminar turned up.

# Nepotism, Narcissism — Or Just the Appearance of It?

Strong words like “nepotism” or “narcissism” often surface in post-event conversations. Whether fair or not, the perception tends to grow when:

* The same voices dominate the stage.
* Recognition appears concentrated among familiar faces.
* Leadership storytelling centres heavily on leadership itself.

Public awards are meant to inspire, but they can just as easily create quiet comparison. For every person clapping on stage, there are others wondering where they fit — and those feelings rarely make it onto the official feedback forms.

A stage creates distance. Distance creates interpretation.

And perception alone is enough to weaken trust.

# The Knowledge Retention Illusion

Years of overhearing post-event discussions suggest that people rarely debate strategy in detail. Instead, they talk about tone:

* “Bit dry, wasn’t it?”
* “Loads of numbers… not sure what it means for us.”
* “Nice lunch though.”

Most of what’s delivered from the front fades quickly once everyone returns to their day jobs. Without real dialogue afterwards, even the most carefully prepared messaging struggles to stick — leaving behind the memory of the event rather than the substance of it.

# The Counterargument — And Yes, There Is One

Supporters of these gatherings argue that they are essential:

* Face-to-face energy matters.
* A single stage avoids mixed messaging.
* Leadership visibility reassures staff.

All fair points. Shared experiences do have value.

But the range of reactions across management, marketing, finance, IT and frontline staff shows that these events can be oddly polarising. Instead of creating one shared culture, they sometimes highlight just how differently each part of the business defines value.

# The Real Issue: Trust Happens Between Sessions

The most honest part of any corporate gathering doesn’t happen under the spotlight. It happens in corridors, queues and lounge chairs where people speak freely.

If those conversations lean towards humour, scepticism or quiet disbelief, organisations should listen carefully. Culture is not defined by slides or slogans; it’s defined by what employees say when they think nobody important is listening.

This is an observational and speculative perspective, not an insider account. But the patterns heard outside the room raise a distinctly British question — delivered with a raised eyebrow rather than a raised voice:

But today was just different, 2 tries on EU cray sahimi and Steamed KC then bam! Both 5 star. 

For those who dont know, upon reaching Lvl 9 and 10 cooking, you will unlock 3 hell dishes…

The Crayfish sashimi, Blue EU crayfish sashimi , and the steamed king crab. These 3 are very hard to grind in my opinion because of how hard it is to gather the ingredients needed, in fact, if it wasnt because of the event, I wouldnt even be able to create steamed king crab as my fishing lvl is only lvl8 (which isnt enough to catch king crabs) 

Regular crayfish hunting isnt hard but takes resources like mermaid tail and the spray thingy but the BLUE Eu crayfish is just HELL. Youre not only limited on its timeslot but also the weather condition itself! There were many times that the weather turns cloudy while I am fishing and all those EU crayfishes just disappears wasting those mermaid tails and sprays entirely.

Ah well , im done getting my masteries on tomato dishes (salad and sauce) will probably get the berries and fruit jams next. Other combination dishes isnt that hard as long as you are not selling all your dishes mindlessly (salads, coffees, tomato sauce , etc)

I know I havent cooked the golden king crab yet but well, I just can’t because of my fishing lvl lol.

\- controlling heat thingy wont affect the star yield  (maybe?) I sometimes have high ping or my cat is blocking meand still got 5 stars even I clicked on the red area 

\- use seasoning on dishes that has difficult ingredients to acquire

\- rainbow bouquet indeed help but at later lvls , I stopped using it as Im always missing rainbow events

\- check other dish ingredients on google first so you wont sell dishes that youll need in the future

\- dont waste anything if your cooking lvl is below lvl8 (seasoning, RB, ingredients)

I had a big glow-up, I’m putting myself out there more, meeting new people, grabbing coffee, chatting, etc.

The thing is, in almost every setting, even when I’m talking a lot, smiling, and asking questions, people still describe me as “shy.” I’m not offended by it, it’s just confusing. In some of these situations I genuinely don’t feel shy at all, so I’m wondering what might be giving off that reserved vibe.
Has anyone else experienced this? What could make someone come across as shy even when they’re actively engaging? ",13,1771677411.0,CasualConversation,11,1.0,False
1raq318,https://i.redd.it/dsvioq0scukg1.jpeg,Redesigned my App Store screenshots to focus on business travel positioning — looking for brutal ASO feedback,"Hey everyone,

I just redesigned my App Store screenshots for my iOS app (TripSuite — a business travel productivity app).

Old version is on top, new version is on bottom.

The app targets frequent business travelers, not vacation planners. My goal is to improve conversion from search terms like:

• business travel planner

• work trip organizer

• itinerary offline

The old screenshots were more feature-focused. The new ones shift toward:

• Clear business positioning

• Structured timeline emphasis

• Stronger hierarchy

• Pro value

What I’m optimizing for:

• Higher search → install conversion

• Clearer niche differentiation vs TripIt/Wanderlog

• Faster comprehension in 3–5 seconds



1. Does the new version communicate the niche clearly?
2. Is the first screenshot strong enough?
3. Any headline hierarchy issues?
4. Would you simplify further?

App is early stage, so I’m iterating aggressively. Appreciate any honest feedback.",1,1771677372.0,AppStoreOptimization,0,1.0,False

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

For unless it's mad, passionate, extraordinary love, it's a waste of time. There are many mediocre things in life, love should not be one of them.

You're my person if you know what you want and you won't settle. You know what you deserve and you won't succumb into the pressure of the society.

So how do we do this? Coffee in a cute café filled with garlic-bread smells? A day spent talking till the lights come on? A cozy movie marathon with fuzzy socks? Let’s connect. Let me get to know you.

For tax reasons (BPM), it was financially beneficial to buy a new company car in 2025. On top of that, my T6 210hp started consuming oil at 100k km, and I swore I’d never buy another Volkswagen without warranty again.

Anyway, I now have a luxury Transporter double cab (Bulli version – haven’t seen many of them yet). I’ve driven exactly 20k km so far. And honestly: I’ve really gone backwards in terms of car. This is my personal opinion.

Negatives:

	•	Not enough power. Towing a trailer through hills? Forget it.

	•	Brakes are terrible. Downhill they overheat very quickly and you can barely stop. With a fully loaded van they’re also very poor. Compared to the T6 / T6.1 it’s not even in the same league.

	•	Gearbox shifts like a truck, and honestly the whole van feels like one. Where the previous model felt almost like a car, this feels like a clumsy work van. Handling, wind sensitivity, and noise levels all feel worse.

	•	Automatic wipers are a disaster. When it rains I’m constantly adjusting the stalk. And if I put the wipers on full speed, they actually go slower because of the sensor.

	•	Driver assistance systems are extremely annoying. I understand the legal requirements, but you have to disable everything every single drive. When reversing off my driveway past parked cars, the van emergency-brakes twice and I can go clean up my spilled coffee again.

	•	Radio sound quality is very poor.

	•	The center display is basically useless. I see a gauge for AdBlue, but I can’t for example put navigation in front of me. You can change a lot of things — except the things you actually want.

	•	Fueling issue: the tank always overflows. Result: diesel shoes. You literally have to jump back in time or you get splashed with diesel.

	•	Rear doors don’t close properly. I have to slam them like a maniac — probably an alignment issue, but still.

	•	Interior quality: dashboard, flaps, compartments all feel and look like cheap, bulky plastic. Like a construction worker’s van. But I expected something different from a Bulli version.

Positives:

	•	More seating space, front and rear.

	•	Rearview camera is excellent, especially in blind spots — gives a good warning if someone is coming around a corner.

	•	IQ headlights are brilliant. Huge amount of light and they work perfectly. I drive almost always on high beam and I’ve never had oncoming traffic flash me.

	•	Large central display is nice and useful, and the standard navigation is definitely an improvement.

	•	Climate control is great. No more turning the same knob 1000 times — now that job is reserved for the wiper stalk instead 😅

	•	Lots of USB ports and charging points throughout the vehicle.",8,1771677086.0,VWTransporter,2,1.0,False

Around 2 months back this older woman comes in (50’s - found out age later). She was asking about sports wear for gym and walking (adidas store) and asked me what I like to wear and what girls are wearing these days etc. Then proceeded to ask my age and said “oh you’re so young” and how 19 was so long ago for her and ended up telling me that she’s divorced while we were chatting and tbh I’m quite into older women. She was very attractive and fit let’s say so I was kinda into her.

While I’m helping her, she’s being pretty flirty first. Complimenting me, sticking around longer than she needed to, asking little personal questions. At one point she asks me how she looks in these tights and kinda turns to show them off. I’m not gonna lie, that doesn’t happen every day so I was entertaining it and quite keen.

I told her she looked good, she’s smiling, laughing at everything I say, touching my arm when she talks and kinda dragging me to come to her. It felt mutual.

So I flirted back. Nothing insane, I wasn’t being gross or anything. Just matching her energy. Before she left I asked if she’d maybe want to grab coffee sometime.

That’s when she goes, kinda laughing, “I don’t know if my niece would like that.” And I’m like… what? Turns out my 21F coworker is her niece. I genuinely had zero clue before that moment and my coworker was on break when her aunt walked in. (Probably why she was there in the first place)

If I’d known, I probably wouldn’t have gone there just out of respect but the aunt has come in a few times since and she still flirts. Same vibes. Smiling, long eye contact, standing close, all of that. It doesn’t feel one-sided.

But now my coworker is PISSED. She went on this whole rant about how I’m gross for hitting on her aunt in her 50s and that I keep giving her “fuck me” eyes across the store (her words). She’s acting like I crossed some massive line.

From my POV:

I didn’t know they were related.

Her aunt is a grown, divorced woman.

She was clearly flirting first.

She didn’t reject me.

She’s still coming in and acting flirty.

I get that it might be weird for my coworker to see, but I don’t feel like I did anything wrong. Everyone involved is an adult and it seemed mutual

Traveling to the other side of the city was tough. She had chosen another drinking establishment herself, but the friend who had snapped her wanted to meet her there.

“It is the hottest bar of today,” Remy said, while Sarah frowned at the holographic version of him in front of her. 

“It is already hot enough today,” she retorted, but he only laughed.

“I’ll be there in about an hour. Need to drop off the kids with Auntie Bee.”

“She is still alive?”

“No no, it is a business. The one we called Auntie Bee is actually called Melissa. I found out when I went there for Charlie.”

“Really?” Sarah put the earphones a bit deeper into her ear, “I clearly miss all the good stuff.”

“I will tell you more when we meet,” Remy laughed.   

Sarah said ‘see you soon’ and turned off her holopad. 



The busbug, a name for the multi limbed busses they used all over the city to climb the many sky scrapers, did not arrive for another thirty minutes so she decided to take the tram. The station was a bit older and most of the benches needed repair. Sarah sat down and took her earphones. She tapped her holopad on and went through her social media. The music had gone out of her earphones, something that happened every now and then and it was not fixable anymore. The other ear could not be muffled from the sound of the tram which had arrived. It was packed, even at that hour. Grumpily Sarah put the volume all the way up while she stepped inside. She had to stand for the entire journey, something she disliked about the city. 



The bar, which was called ‘The Seascape’ had many windows to let in the natural light. Aquariums surrounded the sitting area, filled with many aquatic plants. There were no fish, but Sarah noticed a little prawn cleaning a nearby rock. The room smelled of citrus and coffee.

A robot in the form of an octopus was placed in the corner,  a big rack of different spirits lining up behind it and a bar in front. His many arms flew in and out the cabinet, shaking and stirring different cocktails and placing the finished drinks on the cold metal bar. Human waiters were serving coffee and tea and other drinks to the patrons who sat further away. Sarah looked for a place to sit. It was not too busy at the moment, which she preferred. 



She caught two women near her talking about the current mayor.

“They have given the weather more leniency because of those sunset activists,” one of the women snubbed, “I really don’t understand why they are like this.” 

“If they are so stoked on watching a sunset, they could go to the countryside. They let the weather go lose  there all the time,” the other one replied while sipping from her bright yellow juice, “I don’t know how they can plan their days if they do not know what the weather will be like.”

“I just hope the Body is deciding to repair the greenhouse sector of the Japlin crossing. The bees are confused and my Harvees already got less yield.”



Sarah noticed a man in a suit, standing outside the bar and looking in. He was scowling at the people inside, or perhaps his own reflection. His eyes had an unnatural glow, but he turned away looking for something in his pocket.

 At the bar a man sat hunched against the metal. His bare back showed the hole he had recently paid for at some tattoo shop.  It was healing, waiting for whatever he wanted to get inserted later. Other tables were filled with couples, small families or single patrons like her. 



Sarah found a table near the center of the room and sat down. One of the servers, who was missing the back of her head and decorated the gap with a silver spiderweb, came to her.

“What will it be?” she asked shortly.

“Hi, can I have a shortberry lemonade?” Sarah asked. She was almost certain they would not have them here, but she hoped to be wrong nonetheless. 

“Shortberries are banned from the city,”the waitress replied, “too many overgrowing risks.” She looked around, waiting for Sarah to pick something else. Sarah looked at the menu, scanning it but not finding the right thing. There was nothing with the word lemonade on there. It all had fancy names and equally fancy descriptions.

“We have strawberry flavor,” she said after a long pause.

“Oh okay. Strawberry lemonade please,” Sarah answered.  The waitress nodded and asked some further questions before she left.

Sarah was distracted by another patron who just entered. Her third arm stuck out from between her small chest, a weird place to create that third arm and a definite hint on what her profession was. At the farm Sarah usually worked, most workers had an extra pair of arms to deal with the harvest more efficiently. They spread along their backs like fleshy wings, but they were so useful. Together with the harvesters they could get the work done much quicker. 

While in thought and waiting for her lemonade, she felt a shock going through the bench she was sitting on. She turned her head to see who it was. She had a couple of friends in the city, maybe one of them sneaked up on her.



The man was big and broad. His square jaw was lined with miniscule dark silver nodes. On a sunny day like this, he was wearing a heavy woven coat, hiding his arms in the dark. He looked like an old android. From a model Sarah had not seen before. 



Sarah instantly moved away from him. Robots who looked like robots were fine. People who had some modifications were weird but it was the trend. But androids, they were banned since the last uprising. And an android had killed her parents. 

The android looked at her with his blue eyes, that were a little too bright to be human, thought Sarah. His brown hair almost reached his shoulders. He looked at her as if he expected an answer.

“Exuse me, may I require why you are sitting next to me?” Sarah huffed.

The android did not react immediately. He bowed towards her, which made Sarah crawl away from him. 

“I need you to get down, please,” he said softly, but with a deep voice

“What?” Sarah raised her voice. How dared he, giving her orders.
