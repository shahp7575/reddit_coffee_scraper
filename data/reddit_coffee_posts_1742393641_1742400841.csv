Coffee provides a stronger energy boost, while green tea offers a milder and more sustained effect.
	2.	L-Theanine Content (Green Tea Advantage):
	•	Green tea contains L-theanine, an amino acid that promotes relaxation without drowsiness. This balances caffeine’s stimulating effects, offering calm alertness.
	3.	Acidity:
	•	Coffee is more acidic, which may cause stomach irritation for some people. Green tea is gentler on the stomach.
	4.	Flavor Profile:
	•	Black Coffee: Bold, bitter, and robust.
	•	Green Tea: Mild, earthy, and sometimes grassy.
	5.	Health Benefits Focus:
	•	Black Coffee: Stronger stimulant, ideal for quick energy boosts and mental alertness. May reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes and Parkinson’s disease.
	•	Green Tea: Rich in EGCG (a potent antioxidant) known for promoting heart health, aiding weight loss, and supporting immune function.
	6.	Hydration:
	•	Green tea is generally more hydrating than black coffee, which has mild diuretic effects.
	7.	Effect on Anxiety and Jitters:
	•	Coffee’s higher caffeine content is more likely to cause jitters, anxiety, or sleep disturbances, while green tea’s L-theanine helps reduce these side effects.

⸻

Which Should You Choose?
	•	For Quick Energy: Black coffee is better.
	•	For Calm Focus and Relaxation: Green tea is ideal.

1jf0lgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AssetMantle/comments/1jf0lgt/cosmos_doubles_down_on_evm_opensourcing_evmos/,Cosmos Doubles Down on EVM: Open-Sourcing Evmos Unlocks a New Frontier for RWAs,"The Cosmos ecosystem just dropped a bombshell that’s reverberating through the multichain universe. The Interchain Foundation, the brain trust behind Cosmos’ sprawling network of over 200 appchains, has funded the open-sourcing of Evmos - down 31.14% in the last 24 hours-  as its canonical Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) framework. Dubbed “Cosmos EVM,” this isn’t just a rebrand; it’s a tectonic shift that embeds EVM compatibility into the official Interchain software stack, right alongside the Cosmos SDK.For the uninitiated, Cosmos is the rebel architect of a multichain world—hundreds of sovereign blockchains, each doing its own thing, yet tethered by the Inter-Blockchain Communication (IBC) protocol.   
  
Now, with Cosmos EVM, it’s cracking open the door to Ethereum’s playground. But this isn’t just about playing nice with Ethereum devs. It’s a calculated move that could turbocharge assetization and tokenization, especially for platforms like AssetMantle looking to drag real-world assets (RWAs) kicking and screaming onto the blockchain.Let’s unpack this beast.The Nuts and Bolts: What Cosmos EVM Brings to the TableEvmos isn’t new - it’s been kicking around since 2016 as Ethermint, a skunkworks project to marry EVM’s smart contract mojo with Cosmos’ modular vibe. It hit mainnet in 2022, raised $27 million in a Polychain-led token sale, and became the poster child for EVM-on-Cosmos. Now, it’s shedding its indie skin to become Cosmos EVM, a standardized framework any Cosmos chain can plug into.Here’s the tech rundown:

* Full EVM Compatibility: JSON-RPC? Check. Ethereum wallet support? Check. A lightweight EVM setup for native ERC-20 tokens? Double check. This isn’t a half-baked fork—it’s the real deal, ready to run Ethereum-grade smart contracts on Cosmos soil.
* IBC Superpowers: Cosmos EVM doesn’t just bridge Cosmos to Ethereum; it amplifies IBC’s cross-chain magic. Assets and data can now hop between Cosmos appchains and the broader EVM ecosystem like it’s a multichain highway.
* Standardization FTW: By baking Cosmos EVM into the Interchain stack, Cosmos is handing developers a playbook. No more reinventing the wheel—every appchain can tap the same EVM toolkit.

But the story gets juicier when you zoom out. EVM isn’t just a tech spec; it’s the lingua franca of smart contracts, powering DeFi juggernauts, NFT empires, and everything in between.   
  
By open-sourcing Evmos as Cosmos EVM, Cosmos isn’t just catching up, it’s positioning itself as a multichain hub for the next wave of blockchain adoption.  
  
The RWA Angle: Assetization and Tokenization Get a Glow-UpHere’s where it gets personal. Assetization—turning physical stuff into digital assets—and tokenization—slapping those assets onto a blockchain—are the holy grail for RWAs.  
  
 Think real estate deeds, fine art, or even a farmer’s crop yield, all living as tradable tokens.   
  
Cosmos has a horse in this race: AssetMantle, a platform hell-bent on making RWAs a blockchain reality.Cosmos EVM is a steroid shot for that mission. Let’s break it down1.   
  
Ethereum’s Toolkit, Cosmos’ PlaygroundEVM compatibility means AssetMantle (and every other Cosmos chain) can plunder Ethereum’s treasure chest—think OpenZeppelin contracts, Truffle suites, and battle-tested DeFi protocols.   
  
Want to tokenize a Picasso painting as an NFT? You don’t need to code it from scratch; just grab an ERC-721 template and tweak it. Need a lending market for tokenized real estate? Uniswap’s got a cousin waiting.   
  
This slashes the dev curve.   
  
Ethereum’s ecosystem is a decade deep, Cosmos just inherited that runway.2. Cross-Chain RWA DreamsTokenized assets are only as good as their reach.   
  
A tokenized shipping container on AssetMantle is cool - until you realize it’s stuck there. Cosmos EVM, paired with IBC, turns that container into a globetrotter. Move it to another Cosmos chain. Port it to Ethereum. Trade it on Arbitrum.   
  
The asset’s value isn’t locked in one silo - t’s liquid across ecosystems.For industries like real estate or supply chain, this is a game-changer.   
  
A tokenized warehouse in Dubai could collateralize a loan on Ethereum’s Aave, then settle payments on Osmosis. That’s not sci-fi; it’s now plausible.3. ERC-20s and BeyondThe lightweight EVM config for native ERC-20s is a sleeper hit.   
  
Fungible tokens, say a stablecoin pegged to a gold bar can now live natively on Cosmos chains and still vibe with Ethereum wallets. For AssetMantle, this means tokenized RWAs can double as DeFi Lego bricks, stacking into yield farms or liquidity pools across chains.  
  
Picture this: a tokenized coffee harvest from Ethiopia, issued as an ERC-20 on AssetMantle, traded on Ethereum’s Curve, and redeemed on a Cosmos-based marketplace. That’s the multichain RWA future Cosmos EVM is teasing.  
  
AssetMantle’s Positioning  
  
AssetMantle’s been grinding to make RWAs a thing—think fractional ownership of a skyscraper or a vineyard onchain. Cosmos EVM hands them a megaphone.   
  
Ethereum devs, who might’ve skipped Cosmos for its alien SDK, now have a familiar entry point. That’s more hands building RWA tools.   
  
More projects porting over. More liquidity flowing in. Plus, the interoperability angle means AssetMantle isn’t just a Cosmos player, it’s a contender in the EVM arena.   
  
Tokenized assets can leapfrog to Ethereum, BNB Chain, or Polygon, pulling in users who’d never touch a Cosmos-native app. For a platform betting on RWAs, that’s rocket fuel.  
  
The Market’s Mood Swing—and What’s Next  
  
Not everyone’s popping champagne. The Evmos token tanked over 30% in the last 24 hours, per The Block. Maybe it’s profit-taking. Maybe it’s jitters about co-founder Federico Kunze Küllmer stepping back as a core contributor (though he’ll still advise the Interchain Foundation). His firm, Altiplanic, is also bowing out of Evmos development, leaving some to wonder who’ll steer the ship.  
  
Short-term noise aside, the long game looks bullish. Open-sourcing Evmos as Cosmos EVM screams commitment - standardization, interoperability, and a nod to Ethereum’s dominance. For Cosmos, it’s a bet on becoming the multichain glue for a fragmented industry.  
  
The Bigger Picture  
  
This is a Comsos blueprint. Other ecosystems might take notes: embrace a standard (EVM), open-source it, and watch the network effects kick in.   
  
For RWAs, that’s gold. No single chain can own tokenization, it’s too big, too messy, too cross-industry. It needs a web of interoperable blockchains, and Cosmos just laid a hell of a thread.Buckle up.

1jf0g6x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Scottsdale/comments/1jf0g6x/the_best_hotel_in_scottsdale/,The best hotel in Scottsdale,"About 5-6 months ago I was one of the people asking what the best hotel in Scottsdale was to visit and I believe I have found it. If you are looking for 5-star luxury than the Global Ambassador is the place to be. I stayed for 3 nights and below is my full review:

# Hard Product

This hotel is hands down one of the best I've stayed at in America. The hard product was beyond impressive. The rooms were beautifully designed, offering a luxurious yet cozy vibe. A standout touch was the **Dyson hairdryer** in the room — a rare yet fantastic addition that really elevated the experience.

As for the dining options, they were incredible. There are three standout restaurants on-site:

* **The Cafe**: In the morning, this place is perfect for grabbing some of the best coffee and lattes I've had in a long time. The breakfast food here was phenomenal. By the afternoon, the cafe transitions into a lively bar that's connected to **Le Ame**.
* **Le Ame**: This steakhouse is absolutely top-notch. The food was incredible, and the **sommeliers** were extremely knowledgeable, enhancing the dining experience with their expertise.
* **The Lobby Bar**: A fantastic spot to unwind, chat, and connect with people. The atmosphere is relaxed yet sophisticated, making it great for casual conversations.
* **Thea Rooftop Bar**: Thea boasts stunning views and a trendy ambiance. While the food was delicious, the pacing of the courses felt off. However, once I pointed this out to my server, they immediately acknowledged the issue, went above and beyond to correct it, and even comped an item from the bill — a perfect example of excellent service recovery.

The property also features a boutique that offers some of the best clothing I've seen at a hotel. The selection is incredible, especially if you're looking for stylish dresses and jackets — all at surprisingly reasonable prices. 

The amenities are just as impressive as the dining. The **9,000-square-foot fitness center** is decked out with top-of-the-line equipment. The spa offers cutting-edge therapies with a wide range of recovery tools and treatments, including:

* **IV Hydration Therapy**
* **Stretch & Theragun** sessions
* **Air Compression therapy**
* **PEMF** (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) therapy
* **Cryotherapy**
* **Full-spectrum infrared sauna**
* **Light therapy**

The grounds are absolutely beautiful. The gardens in the middle of the property add a serene and peaceful vibe, and the overall design makes it feel like you're somewhere in **Europe**, not Scottsdale. The architecture, landscaping, and décor create a ""trendy"" yet sophisticated atmosphere that stands out.

Lastly, the location is the prime spot. Only 15 minutes away from the mall and old town so you can do everything in town.

# Soft Product

While my experience with the hard product was outstanding, the soft product started out a little shaky. At the beginning of my stay, I had to request a few things multiple times, which was frustrating. However, once I addressed these concerns with the **concierge** and their team, they quickly made sure everything was smooth from that point forward. Given how busy the hotel is, I think this was just an early hiccup.

Overall, it's clear that the staff genuinely cares about the guest experience, and they put in the effort to ensure issues are resolved.

  
some things to note: I did stay at the four seasons and sanctuary a while back and I think they were both overpriced for what they're worth. I just had to make a post about this place if anyone else is debating on which hotels are good in scottsdale",1,1742400142.0,Scottsdale,6,0.57,False

I mentioned that I’ve been brewing with my Gaggia Classic, which I picked up second-hand back in 2021, and how I’ve been thinking it might be time to move on to something like the Rocket Appartamento. The idea of a shiny new machine with a little more power and finesse just kept creeping into my mind.

As I was explaining my thoughts, one of my friends overheard and, with a grin, said, ""Sounds like you’ve got a serious case of upgraditis."" I stopped and was like, ""Upgraditis?""

I'll be hones up front, I run a loyalty program service, so I would assume this will come off as me trying to snag some customers... But I'm just trying to gather some insights so I can market better.

I have seen you guys talking a bit about loyalty programs but I'd like to know from you that are running ""old-school"" paper stamp cards, how often you hear from customers that they forgot/lost their card? How much do you spend on stocking up on the cards, stamps, design maybe?

My questions really sound like a prelude to a sales pitch, but I'm honestly interested to know. And I wont mention my service unless I'm asked about it.

I did the thing and escaped bedside after 2 years in it ( I know - not long!). The shift work killed me and the union where I live sucks. Luckily in August I did some job searching and landed a plastic surgery job in my cities most affluent area. Get this though…. 

I’m paid much more than my union rate at the hospital. I actually only worked 40 hours a couple weeks ago and was still paid the same as I would have been doing my usual biweekly 90 hours in hospital. We also get a $50 bonus for every before/after we submit. I usually get an extra $200-300 a month from this. 

My level of freedom is insane. If there are no surgeries booked, I don’t have to come in, but I can if I want the money. This means 8 hours of
Literal no work I just have to be physically present. My coworkers and I play games most of the day. Not to mention it’s 9-5, we are OVER staffed with nurses too. We are given a free lunch once a week. We have snacks and drinks and coffee for free. 

Did I luck out or is this the norm outside of healthcare? Everyday I basically thank god for this gig. My stress levels have decreased so much people have told me I actually look younger! ",22,1742399890.0,nursing,6,1.0,False

1jf0blb,https://www.reddit.com/r/CAStateWorkers/comments/1jf0blb/governor_newsom_and_the_returntooffice_dystopia/,Governor Newsom and the Return-to-Office Dystopia,"**It began with a decree.**

Governor Gavin Newsom, once hailed as the slick-haired savior of progressive policies, had taken a dark turn. In a stunning reversal of his former promises, he issued ***Executive Order 666*** —a mandate that all California state workers must return to the office, four days a week, with hard to qualify exceptions.

The announcement sent shockwaves through the state. Employees who had spent years thriving in the comfort of their home offices—where pajama pants were the official uniform and “technical difficulties” were a get-out-of-meeting-free card—were suddenly being dragged back to their cubicle prisons.

The reasoning? ***“A stronger California starts with stronger office attendance.”***

But the workers knew the truth. This wasn’t about productivity. ***This was about control.***

**The Fall of Remote Workers**

The transition was brutal.

On **Day One**, traffic on I-80 and the 405 reached historic levels. Helicopter footage showed thousands of state employees stuck in gridlock, some abandoning their vehicles and attempting to walk the final miles to their offices. A group of DMV clerks built a makeshift village on the shoulder of Highway 50, surviving on stale granola bars and the water they had stored in their emotional-support Stanleys.

By **Week Two**, office buildings were overflowing. The hot desk system had turned into an all-out war, with employees setting up booby traps and marking territory with passive-aggressive sticky notes. Printer riots broke out as decades-old machines refused to cooperate. In the worst-hit agencies, IT workers attempted to fix connectivity issues with a single roll of duct tape and a YouTube tutorial from 2009.

The worst part? ***The unofficial dress code had returned.***

With deep sorrow, employees bid farewell to their beloved sweatpants and oversized hoodies, trading them in for stiff slacks and “business casual” sweaters that itchily reminded them of their captivity.

**Governor Newsom’s Regime**

Meanwhile, from his golden tower in Sacramento, Governor Newsom watched it all unfold.

His hair—perfectly sculpted, defying the laws of physics—gleamed in the fluorescent light as he sat at his desk, sipping an oat milk latte made by his personal, in-office barista.

“Excellent,” he murmured, scrolling through reports of increased badge swipes and suffering. “They’re back where they belong.”

His advisors nodded solemnly. ***Rumors had spread that the governor had made a dark pact with the parking garage lobby and the corporate lunch industry***, both of which had suffered dearly during the remote work era. With workers back in the office, overpriced parking meters and $18 salads would once again thrive.

**The Underground Rebellion**

But not all state workers accepted their fate.

Deep within the basement of a nondescript government building, ***a resistance*** was brewing. Led by an anonymous figure known only as ***The Teleworker***, a faction of employees refused to comply with Newsom’s tyranny.

Their tactics were genius.  
	**•	Fake Badge Swipes**: Employees took turns sneaking into the office to scan everyone’s badges, creating the illusion of full attendance while the rest worked safely from home.  
	**•	The VPN Mirage**: IT rebels rerouted network traffic to make it seem as if state employees were logging in from their office desktops—when in reality, they were dialing in from their couches, sipping coffee in fuzzy socks.  
	**•	The Fake Meeting Gambit**: Resistance members flooded calendars with so many useless meetings that no one could actually work, making the return-to-office mandate completely pointless.  

As the rebellion grew, Governor Newsom became ***increasingly paranoid.***

**The Final Showdown**

One fateful morning, the governor summoned his top enforcers—a team of humorless HR officials and mid-level managers with nothing to lose.

“It’s time,” Newsom said, rising from his ergonomic leather chair. “We crack down on these work-from-home radicals.”

Armed with spreadsheets, compliance memos, and an army of overzealous supervisors, they stormed government buildings, hunting down the rebels.

But the ***resistance was ready.***

At precisely **9:01 AM**, every printer in the state malfunctioned at once, spitting out **nothing but the words “LET US WORK FROM HOME” in Comic Sans.**

At **9:15 AM,** all Wi-Fi networks mysteriously went down.

By **9:30 AM**, resistance fighters triggered a statewide Microsoft Teams crash, leaving management completely helpless—without the ability to send passive-aggressive follow-up emails, they were utterly powerless.

***Governor Newsom screamed in frustration, but it was too late.***

As state buildings plunged into chaos, thousands of employees fled—rushing home, slamming their laptops open, and reactivating their VPNs. Within an hour, the entire workforce had returned to remote operations, their webcams blissfully turned off.

**The Aftermath**

Governor Newsom, defeated, retreated to his office, staring at his reflection in the window. **His hair was still perfect, but his empire had crumbled.**

And so, California returned to **the way things were meant to be—with state employees working efficiently from home, as nature intended.**

**The Great Return-to-Office had failed.**

**And balance was restored.**",14,1742399835.0,CAStateWorkers,5,0.77,False

MORE INFO IN POST,"Hello r/Hoboken \- ites! “What is the Best Bar In Hoboken?"" is a question that is often asked in some form on r/Hoboken, with many answers across the board in this community.

Well now, in the spirit of March Madness, we will attempt to definitively answer this question via a series of polls/surveys, with a style single elimination tournament for members of the r/Hoboken community to vote on, and democratically and definitively decide which bars will advance from the Pre-Game Round, to the Tipsy Thirty Two, Sloshed Sixteen, Inebriated Eight, and the Fuddled Four, until one bar is finally crowned ""r/Hoboken's Bar-ch Madness Champion!"").

The winning establishment will be showcased in a dedicated post on the homepage ( memorialized on the r/Hoboken sidebar, with Wilton House also featured alongside it as an Honorable Mention. (No, Wilton House will NOT be included in the main tournament itself since it's a recurring joke in the subreddit, which is why we're including it as an honorable mention). We’ll be using this exercise as a way to kick off some ”Best of Hoboken“ series for similar other subjects such as ”Best Coffee Shop”, “Best Pizza”, “Best Bagels” , and more down the line (more to come here).   


Background 

To help organize the bars, I’ve combed through active liquor licenses for bars in Hoboken (eliminating liquor stores and restaurants that just happened to have a liquor license- this has required a few judgement calls on my end for sake of organization, but open to potential changes based on feedback - I tried to use a rough criteria based on the spirit of the question: “could someone go/be recommended to go to this place with the expectation of only getting drinks (not planning  for food or additional activities on-site) 

 This has resulted me narrowing the list down to about 54 bars (sans Wilton House) across 4 “regions” based on appropriate geographic location in town: Uptown, Midtown, Downtown, and Waterfront. To determine seeding - I’ll post the name (and region) of each bar in a comment in this thread. The higher the upvote count, the better the seeding, I’ll use average Google Reviews scores for any tiebreakers if necessary.  Upvote/downvote for seeding through 3/24.

After 3/24, We’ll do one round of voting a week until we crown a champion! I’ll include links to google forms where the Subreddit can vote on all matchups for each round.

Feel free to give any (constructive) feedback and vote accordingly. Happy Bracketeering!

Variety interview with Sarandos. It’s mostly about other Netflix subjects, but of course he was asked about the Narkle in the room.

> We’re a passive partner in Meghan’s company, and it’s a big discovery model for us right now. 

Passive partner? What does this mean? They're leaving Narkle to fail on her own? No rescue plan?

> I think Meghan is underestimated in terms of her influence on culture... People are fascinated with Meghan Markle. She and Harry are overly dismissed. 

If by _fascinated_ he means _disgusted_, then yes, I agree. 

As for how items Narkle wears ""sells out"", I was under the impression all those items were popular / sold out _prior_ to her ridiculous puff pieces announcing her wearing them. 

I'd like to know what items Narkle merches _actually_ sells. Cesta Collective? Mushroom coffee? Stress patches? The lab grown diamond company?

I have never purchased any items Narkle merches. What's more, I keep track of the companies that work with her and make it a point to never purchase from these companies. I vote with my dollar. 

I think Sarandos is confused about people's _fascination_ with Narkle. It's the same fascination people have for train wrecks -- we can't believe the mess we're seeing. _Fascination_ doesn't translate to sales. 🤷‍♀️",25,1742399267.0,SaintMeghanMarkle,17,1.0,False

I promise I'm not a shill, but it was pretty much 100% positive. Surgery and recovery went super smoothly. Drs were very nice and answered all of my questions. Nurses and techs were very sweet and helpful. Pain managed well. Surgery was done by Dr. Contin and I was there for 3 nights.   
  
The only thing that went wrong is towards the end the pain meds were on demand (vs scheduled) and I woke up in a lot of pain on night 2 and called and asked for medication and I waited for about an hour before I called again, but the second time I called my nurse came within 5 minutes. But like, even that was pretty minor.

Room was really big and clean. Husband says that the sleeping couch was pretty comfy.

Food was a little hit or miss. You can tell what was prepared there and what was premade. Things that were really good were

* omelettes and home fries were fresh and tasty. 
* **Definitely get the roast beef sandwich.** It's rare and delicious. 
* Chicken fingers were reliable for dinner. 
* Chicken parm was fine. 
* Green beans were better than the broccoli. 
* Garden salad was fine. 
* The soups were uniformly bad. 
* Scrambled eggs were terrible. 
* Coffee was surprisingly decent.

Just remember than any condiments you need you have to order separately like ketchup, mustard, mayo, salt, pepper, etc.

Also for me the portions were a little small, so I would order some fruit and yogurt with every meal so I could have a little snacky snack later.

As for what to pack... they have everything for baby there, just needed a going home outfit.

For me, obviously skincare and other toiletries. Soap for the shower bc there is no soap dispenser in the shower. They had pads and disposable undies.

Stuff I used the most were 

* emotional support water bottle. They give you a pitcher with tiny cups
* a pair of really cheap shower shoes that I threw out when I left 
* my robe for walking around the floor
* towel from home for showering
* pillows for your support person. They provide sheets and blankets but the pillows suck.
* Kindle. (The entertainment options are good, but I had been in for observation a few months ago and they didn't have anything new since then).

Things I wish I would have had is 

* more snacks, 
* an eye mask for sleeping bc even with all the lights off it was super bright in our room 
* if you're going to be there for multiple nights, a small humidifier. The air is really really dry.

It’s particularly hard being invited out for mum and baby lunches/coffees/classes when everyone can just sit around chatting with their babies in prams/sat on laps quite content with a basic toy. I cannot catch a break. I’m constantly up, moving, playing, finding things to entertain her with to stop her whinging. I can’t even order food because I know I can’t entertain her/hold her/pacify her and be able to eat myself. I’m just exhausted. I don’t want to be wishing away her awake time when we are solo during the day but I really just need the time to function with my basic needs. If I’m out of her sight for even a minute she whines! I see other babies completely placid. Even at swimming lessons, these babies are unphased by what’s happening and just completely relaxed. I’m so overwhelmed 100% of the time. 
My partner is great and my family are a great support but on the daily I just find it so disheartening seeing other babies and mums and coping with everyday life! I feel like a bad mum!

In the mornings, I usually stop by starbucks and grab a coffee and a breakfast sandwich. I want to change this habit bc one 1. it's an expensive habit and 2. it's time to start losing weight. 

So this is what I had in mind for a breakfast sandwich: 

\- Ciabatta bread 

\- One egg with spinach mixed in 

\- One slice of american cheese 

\- one slice of turkey bacon split in half 

  
I calculated the calories for one sandwich and it comes out to 454. Is this fine for a breakfast sandwich? Or should i change something to lower the calorie count?

Thanks for any input!

When he came to the Netherlands (where I live) I was really nervous about the meeting. We both visited my grandma and I had been thinking and stressing so long about how this moment was going to be. But now the moment was actually here. My grandma offered me something to drink, she had water, coffee or apple juice. I said, i'll have some apple juice. 

The first thing my father said to me after 2 years of not speaking to him was a cynical comment about the fact that I chose apple juice, and that it was for little children. 

When I think back about this moment It makes me really mad. I am mad at him but I am also mad at myself, because I let him belittle me like that. Even after 2 years of contact I still let him belittle me like that. 

I wish I could go back to that moment and say something to him like: ""Really?!?! This is the First thing you say to me after 2 years?!?!, I dont have to take this, you can try again if you have something nice to say.""

But at that moment I couldn't. Now we are sometimes in contact again, only via whatsapp but I die a little bit inside every time I send a message because it feels like I am too weak to stand up to my father.

Later on I asked my boyfriend who Jake was meeting and he told me Jake was meeting a girl (let’s call her Jane) that he had a thing with in the past. While they were never officially together, they were seeing each other on and off for years which included going on holidays together, meeting each other’s friends and families and they had a sexual relationship too. My boyfriend said that Jake was meeting this girl to give her closure because things with them apparently ended abruptly just before he got in his current relationship. However, his girlfriend wasn’t told about this meeting because she “wouldn’t understand” (yeah too right she wouldn’t!). Later that night, the three of us were out and we bumped into Jane and her friend in the pub we were in. Jake and Jane were all over each other and they kissed at one point too. Me, Jane’s friend and my boyfriend were all appalled by this. Jake himself later admitted he shouldn’t have met up with her in the first place but other than that he didn’t show a huge amount of remorse and I don’t know if he will tell his girlfriend what happened. My boyfriend says he is going to talk to Jake and try to get him to tell the truth to his girlfriend but ultimately I don’t know if Jake will tell her. Should I reach out to his girlfriend?

I have a long distance boyfriend who I am planning on moving across the country for. There have been a few red flags that gave me a bit of pause, so I decided to set him up and see if he is faithful, since I don’t really know what he does when I’m not there. I am supposed to leave town to visit him tomorrow where we are having our annual St. Patrick’s Day date at the restaurant we frequent every year, since our very first date. I decided to tell him I had to push the trip back one day just a few hours after a friend of mine texted him as a divorced female who needed his business services. 

He told me he was going to keep the reservation, but ask his old friend Bill to go with him. As soon as I canceled, he asked the prospective female client if she wanted to meet for coffee for business and then at the restaurant afterwards for dinner, claiming his old male friend, had to cancel on him last minute. Then he texted me, letting me know that Bill agreed to go with him and all was good. I came clean and he obviously was very upset with me for deceiving him. He was not able to deny that a romantic relationship with this woman did not cross his mind, however, he said that I have not been giving him the stability that he needs. However, this is not the first time I have caught him denying that he is in a relationship. Am I the asshole for setting him up or did I do the right thing considering I just need to know exactly what I’m getting into?

##​ Aquatabs Review: Effectiveness and Safety

The core question is: how well do Aquatabs actually work? Numerous⁤ aquatabs reviews focus‍ on​ their effectiveness in killing harmful⁤ pathogens. the active ingredient, sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC), is a chlorine-based ⁤disinfectant​ proven to be effective against a wide‍ range⁣ of waterborne microorganisms.

*   **Bacteria and Viruses:** Aquatabs excel at eliminating bacteria and viruses, which are common threats in contaminated water sources. ⁤Independent testing demonstrates their ability to meet or exceed minimum performance targets for these pathogens⁢ [5].*  ⁢ **Giardia⁤ and Cryptosporidium:**⁢ While Aquatabs‍ are effective against ⁢bacteria and viruses, it's important to note ⁢that they are **less effective against protozoan cysts like Giardia and Cryptosporidium**. High concentrations and longer contact times are required to kill these cysts which may ‌be a downside in aquatabs review ​effectiveness. For water sources suspected ⁤of contamination with⁢ these parasites, consider using ​a⁤ combination of Aquatabs with pre-filtration or alternative purification methods.
*   **Water Clarity:** Aquatabs work best ⁣in **clear water**. If the water is cloudy or contains sediment, that organic matter can shield microorganisms from the disinfectant, reducing its⁣ effectiveness. Always pre-filter murky water through a cloth or coffee‍ filter to remove visible particles before using Aquatabs.

Aquatabs review safety always focuses on potential health concerns. The amount of chlorine released by Aquatabs‌ is typically low and considered safe for consumption.However, some individuals may be sensitive to chlorine and experience a ‌slight​ taste or odor. This can often be mitigated by allowing ‍the water to aerate for ​a period of⁤ time after treatment.

aquatabs review safety ⁣shows that serious side effects from using Aquatabs are rare when used as directed. ​the benefits of safe drinking water generally outweigh the potential risks associated with the low levels of chlorine exposure.

## Unbiased Aquatabs Review: Pros and Cons

To provide an aquatabs⁤ review unbiased, let's consider the advantages ⁣and disadvantages:

**Pros:**

*   **Lightweight and Portable:** Aquatabs are incredibly lightweight and compact,⁤ making them ideal for backpacking, travel, and emergency⁤ kits.
*​   **Easy to Use:** Simply drop a‌ tablet into water and ‌wait. No special‌ equipment or technical⁣ skills are required. The instructions review are very straightforward.
* ⁣  **Effective Against Bacteria and ‍Viruses:** Proven to kill most common waterborne⁣ bacteria⁤ and viruses.
*   **Long Shelf Life:** Aquatabs typically‌ have a long shelf life‍ (often 3-5 years), making them suitable for long-term storage in emergency preparedness ‍kits.
*   **Affordable:** Aquatabs are relatively inexpensive​ compared ‌to‍ other water⁢ purification methods.‍ The Aquatabs​ price review shows it's a very competitive ‌option for the budget-conscious consumer.

**Cons:**

*   ​**less ‌effective against ⁢Protozoan Cysts:** not as effective against ⁢Giardia and Cryptosporidium unless used in high concentrations and with extended contact ​times.
*   **Taste and Odor:** ⁣Some individuals may notice a slight chlorine taste or ⁣odor in the treated water.
*  ‍ **Requires Clear Water:** Works best ‍in clear water. Pre-filtration is ‌necessary for ⁢murky water sources.
*   ⁢**Contact Time:** Requires a waiting period (typically 30 minutes) before the water is safe to⁢ drink.
*  ⁢ **Dosage Considerations:** Requires careful attention to dosage based on the volume of water being treated (as highlighted in aquatabs ‌dosage review). ⁤Using too little will result in unsafe water, using too much will ⁣produce distasteful ⁤water.[[Explore Top Rated aquatabs review on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/sawyer-mini/?kw=aquatabs review)
## Aquatabs vs Other Water Purification ⁣methods

Aquatabs are just one of many water purification options‌ available. An aquatabs vs other water purification comparison is essential to determine if they are the best choice for⁤ your needs.

*   **Water‍ Filters:** Water filters physically remove contaminants⁣ from water.They are generally more effective than Aquatabs at removing protozoan cysts and can also improve the taste and clarity of the water. However,⁣ filters can ​be ⁣bulky, require maintenance, and may be more expensive than ​Aquatabs.
*‌   **Water ‍Purification Pens (UV):** UV pens use ultraviolet light to kill ‌microorganisms. They are effective against bacteria, viruses, and protozoan cysts. However, they require batteries and may not work well in ‍cloudy water.
*   **Boiling:** Boiling water ⁣for one‍ minute (or three minutes at higher altitudes) is ‍a ‍reliable way to kill most harmful microorganisms. Though, it requires a heat source⁤ and time,⁤ and it doesn't improve the ​taste or clarity of the water.
*   **Water Purification Drops (Chlorine Dioxide):** Chlorine dioxide drops are effective against bacteria, viruses, and⁤ protozoan cysts, including Giardia and Cryptosporidium. Though, they frequently enough require a two-part mixing ⁣process and may have a⁤ stronger taste‌ than Aquatabs.
*  ⁤ **Alternative Water Purification Tablet Reviews:** Various brands offer water purification tablets beside Aquatabs. These include katadyn Micropur, Potable Aqua, and MSR Aquatabs. Katadyn Micropur uses silver ions for disinfection, while potable Aqua uses iodine.MSR Aquatabs are very similar to ‌Aquatabs, using NaDCC as their active ingredient.Choosing the best alternative requires careful comparison of price, effectiveness, taste, and user preference.

## Aquatabs Review: ​target ⁢Audience Considerations

Let's delve‍ deeper into how Aquatabs meet the needs of specific audience segments:

**Outdoor Enthusiasts (Hikers, Campers, Backpackers):**

Travelers ​should pay attention to the aquatabs instructions review to ensure proper dosage and contact time.‍ In some regions, water sources​ may be heavily contaminated and require higher concentrations of chlorine for effective disinfection. It's also essential to consider potential ​side effects and​ take precautions to minimize chlorine ​taste or odor.

**Emergency Preparedness Individuals & Preppers:**

## Aquatabs Instructions Review and Dosage

Proper usage ​is crucial for ensuring ⁤the effectiveness and safety of Aquatabs. ⁤The Aquatabs instructions review reveals the simplicity of the request, yet highlights specific steps:

1.  **Find the Right Dosage:** Determine​ the volume of⁤ water you need to⁢ purify and use the correct number of tablets.Aquatabs typically come in different dosages for different water volumes. Consult the packaging for ‌specific ⁢instructions. Usually,‍ one tablet purifies one liter of water.2.**Clear up your water:** Filter any cloudy water through ⁢a ​clean cloth or coffee filter to‍ remove sediment and debris. ‍Without filtering the water,​ it could render the Aquatabs⁤ ineffective.
3.  **Adding Tablet:** Add the tablet to the volume of water⁣ you are treating.

5.**Mix and Wait:** Shake or stir the water to ensure the⁤ chlorine is evenly distributed.Allow the water⁢ to ⁣sit for at least 30⁢ minutes ⁤before drinking.This contact time is essential for the chlorine to kill harmful microorganisms.
6.⁤  **Smell Before ​You Sip:** If you cannot detect a slight chlorine odor after the waiting period, repeat‍ the dosage‍ and wait another 30 minutes.
7.  ⁤**Aerate (Optional):** If you are⁤ sensitive to the taste or⁣ odor of chlorine, aerate the water by pouring it back and forth between containers or letting⁤ it stand uncovered ⁣for a period of time.

Following the instructions carefully and paying attention to⁣ dosage and‌ contact time will help maximize the effectiveness of Aquatabs and​ minimize any potential side effects.

## Aquatabs ‌Review Taste Considerations: ⁢Minimizing Chlorine Taste

While Aquatabs are effective at purifying water, some users may find the chlorine ​taste or odor unpleasant. Here are a few tips to ​minimize the ⁤taste:

*   **Aerate the Water:** As‌ mentioned earlier, aerating the water by pouring it back ⁢and forth between containers or letting it stand uncovered can help ⁣dissipate‌ the chlorine.
*   **Use Vitamin C:** Adding a small amount of Vitamin C powder (ascorbic acid) to the treated water can neutralize the chlorine taste. However, be careful not to add too much, as it can also affect the pH of the water.
* ⁤  **Add Flavorings:** adding a few drops ‍of lemon juice, lime juice, or a flavored‍ drink mix can help mask the chlorine taste.
*   **Wait Longer:** Allowing ‍the water to sit‌ for a longer period of ⁢time after ⁤the initial contact time can also help reduce the chlorine⁣ taste.finding the right balance between effective ⁤purification and palatable water is key. Experiment with⁤ different techniques to find what works best for​ you.

## Aquatabs Clinical Trials Review and scientific​ Backing

While⁤ anecdotal evidence and user‍ reviews are valuable, ​scientific studies and clinical trials provide a more objective assessment of Aquatabs' effectiveness. Numerous ⁣studies have evaluated the performance of Aquatabs in various water sources and under ⁣different environmental conditions.

These ⁢clinical trials review have consistently demonstrated that ​Aquatabs are effective at killing bacteria and viruses. The World⁣ Health ⁢Institution (WHO)⁤ has also evaluated‍ Aquatabs and ⁣concluded that they meet or ‌exceed minimum performance⁤ targets for ⁤these pathogens ​ [5].

It's critically important ⁢to note that most clinical trials focus ‍on the effectiveness⁢ of Aquatabs against specific microorganisms.

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

**Why This Pick?**

While the Magic have pulled off a few sneaky wins over the last week, they’re still no match for Houston in my opinion. Orlando played the Rockets back on March 10th and lost by 13 points – and have lost 7 of their last 10 outings. To be frank, I think their upset of the Cleveland Cavaliers on Sunday has this spread set where it is, but I say Houston and their top tier defense pick up a solid road win here. Having won their last 7 straight by at least 3 points, I’ll take the Rockets to cover.

1jezkix,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jezkix,A Little Update,"Hi everyone, I posted a few weeks ago about my new 924 and thought I’d give an update. 


The good news. 

It seems like everything is still in the car so I shouldn’t have any issues with finding parts. 

Both the fuel and air system were easy enough to clean. 

I  do have three lines coming off the air intake, throttle body, and valve cover which are plugged with bolts. I’m assuming that it’s EGR, a vacuum system and/or a vent that isn’t super important. 

The ignition system is all fine.

 
The bad news.

Most of the wiring is bad. Honestly I expected this and it’s not going to be a huge deal to rewire the car, but I still wanted to start it last weekend. 


I should be able to rewire the starter pretty quickly and I’ll move on to other parts as they’re needed. 

Once again any suggestions you have are greatly appreciated.  I’ve mostly been using a Chilton manual which has been very helpful along with some diagrams from pelican and other sites.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to choosing the right size for your portable power station, there are several factors you need to consider to ensure you get the best fit for your needs. Whether you're planning a camping trip, preparing for emergencies, or looking to power tools and electronics during outdoor events, understanding these factors can help you make an informed decision.

**Determine Your Power Needs**

- Calculate the wattage of all devices you plan to power simultaneously. Add up their individual wattage requirements to get the total power needed.
- Consider the runtime you require. Longer runtimes may necessitate a larger capacity power station.

**Battery Capacity**

- Look at the battery capacity in watt-hours (Wh) or ampere-hours (Ah). Higher capacities mean more power available.
- Compare different models to find one that meets your power needs while also considering weight and portability.

**Types of Outlets and Ports**

- Ensure the power station has the appropriate outlets (AC, USB-A, USB-C, DC, etc.) for your devices.
- Check for special features like fast charging ports, which can be crucial for powering modern gadgets efficiently.

**Recharge Time**

​ Shop here &gt;https://www.portablepower101.com  
- Consider how long it takes to recharge the power station fully. Some models charge faster than others, which can be important if you need to use it frequently.
- Look at the input options like AC wall adapter, car charger, or solar panels. Diverse charging methods offer flexibility in different situations.

**Weight and Portability**

- Choose a power station that is easy to carry around, especially if you plan to take it on trips or use it outdoors.
- Consider the size and design of the unit. Some models come with handles or wheels for added convenience.

**Brand Reputation and Warranty**

- Research the brand’s reputation for reliability and customer service. Look for reviews and ratings from other users.
- Check the warranty offered by the manufacturer. A good warranty can provide peace of mind and protection against defects.

**Cost**

- Set a budget based on your needs and priorities. Remember that higher capacities often come with higher prices.
- Compare prices across different retailers to find the best deal. Sometimes sales or discounts can make a big difference.

**Special Features**

​ Shop here &gt;https://www.portablepower101.com  
- Some power stations come with additional features like built-in flashlights, LCD displays showing remaining power, or even integrated solar panels.
- These features can enhance usability and convenience, so consider whether they are worth the extra cost.

**Environmental Factors**

- If you plan to use the power station in remote areas or harsh environments, look for models that are rugged and weather-resistant.
- Consider the impact of temperature on battery performance. Extreme cold or heat can affect the efficiency and lifespan of the battery.

**Future Proofing**

- Think about the future needs you might have. As technology evolves, newer devices may require more power.
- Choosing a power station with expandable capacity or multiple outlets can help you adapt to changing needs over time.

Selecting the right size for your portable power station involves balancing various factors like power needs, battery capacity, portability, and additional features. By carefully considering these elements, you can choose a power station that perfectly fits your lifestyle and ensures reliable power whenever you need it.

Real-Life Scenarios: Matching Portable Power Station Sizes to Your Needs
------------------------------------------------------------------------

When choosing a portable power station, understanding your needs is crucial. Whether you're planning a camping trip, a road adventure, or preparing for emergencies, selecting the right size ensures you have enough power without carrying excess weight. Let’s dive into some real-life scenarios to help you match portable power station sizes to your specific requirements.

**Scenario 1: Weekend Camping Trip**

​ Shop here &gt;https://www.portablepower101.com  
If you’re going on a weekend camping trip with a small group, you’ll need a portable power station that can handle basic electronic devices like smartphones, tablets, and perhaps a small cooler. A 100Wh to 200Wh capacity power station would suffice for these needs. You can charge your phone multiple times and even keep a small fan running overnight. For instance, a 150Wh power station can comfortably power a smartphone 10-15 times or a tablet 4-6 times, depending on their power consumption.

**Scenario 2: Extended Family Vacation**

For a larger family vacation where you might bring along more gadgets like laptops, cameras, and even a mini-fridge, you'll need a power station with a higher capacity. A 300Wh to 500Wh model could be ideal. This range allows you to charge laptops (typically consuming around 40Wh per hour) for several hours, run a mini-fridge for a few hours a day, and still have enough juice left over for other devices. For example, a 400Wh power station can support a laptop for about 10 hours or a mini-fridge for a couple of hours.

**Scenario 3: Off-Grid Cabin Living**​ Shop here &gt;https://www.portablepower101.com

If you plan to spend extended periods off-grid, such as in a cabin or remote work setup, a larger power station is necessary. A 1000Wh to 1500Wh capacity power station would be suitable. These models can handle more substantial power draws, including lighting, heating elements, and even some kitchen appliances. For instance, a 1200Wh power station can power a light bulb for 40 hours, a small heater for 8 hours, and a coffee maker for a single brew. This setup ensures you have reliable power for both daily activities and occasional high-power tasks.

**Scenario 4: Emergency Preparedness**

In emergency situations, such as power outages or natural disasters, having a portable power station that can keep essential devices running is critical. A mid-range power station with a capacity between 500Wh to 1000Wh is a good choice. This size can power essential items like medical devices, communication tools, and small appliances. For example, a 700Wh power station can keep a CPAP machine running for about 14 hours, a smartphone charged for a week, and a small fan running for several days. This ensures you stay connected and have access to necessary equipment during critical times.

**Scenario 5: Road Trips with Multiple Devices**​ Shop here &gt;https://www.portablepower101.com

Long road trips with a family often require keeping multiple devices powered, from smartphones and tablets to portable game consoles and portable speakers. A 500Wh to 1000Wh power station can manage these demands effectively. It can recharge smartphones and tablets numerous times, keep portable speakers playing music for hours, and even charge a small car vacuum cleaner. For instance, a 700Wh power station can handle a smartphone 15-20 charges, a tablet 5-7 charges, and a portable speaker for several days.

**Scenario 6: Outdoor Photography and Videography**

For outdoor photographers and videographers, a portable power station that can handle high-power devices like DSLR cameras, drones, and lighting kits is essential. A 1000Wh to 1500Wh capacity power station is recommended. This size ensures you can keep your camera batteries charged throughout the day, fly your drone for extended periods, and power LED lights without worrying about running out of power. For example, a 1200Wh power station can charge a DSLR battery 20-25 times, power a drone for several flights, and run LED lights for several hours.

**Scenario 7: Home Office Setup**​ Shop here &gt;https://www.portablepower101.com

If you rely on technology for work and need a reliable power source during power outages or when working remotely in areas without grid electricity, a 1000Wh to 1500Wh power station is ideal. This setup can handle laptops, monitors, and other office electronics. For instance, a 1200Wh power station can keep a laptop running for about 30 hours, a monitor for 10 hours, and charge a smartphone 20-30 times. This ensures you remain productive without interruptions.

**Final Thoughts**

Selecting the right portable power station depends on your specific needs. Consider the devices you plan to power, the duration of your activity, and any additional features like solar charging capabilities. By matching the power station size to your requirements, you can ensure you have reliable, continuous power wherever your adventures take you.

### Conclusion

Choosing the right size for your portable power station involves understanding your specific needs and usage scenarios. By considering factors like power requirements, device compatibility, and runtime expectations, you can make an informed decision. Whether you're camping, traveling, or preparing for emergencies, there's a portable power station size that fits perfectly. Real-life examples show how different situations demand different capacities. For instance, a weekend camping trip might only need a smaller model, while running multiple devices during an extended outage requires a larger one. Ultimately, selecting the ideal size ensures you stay powered up without lugging around unnecessary weight. Remember, investing time upfront to assess your needs pays off in long-term convenience and reliability.",1,1742397837.0,PortablePower101,0,1.0,False

I was accused of bullying a new employee. 

Context:
Our dept head called me in because I was accused of bullying because my colleagues and I were having a light-hearted conversation and laughing, just as we do every day.

I even treated her to coffee, snacks, and lunch. So why would she accuse me of bullying when I only interact with her on work-related matters? Is it because she feels excluded from our group? Despite the inconvenience she has caused me, I chose to let it go because I don’t have time to dwell on petty issues. I prefer not to waste my energy on people who don’t truly matter.

What frustrates me is that I’ve been working hard and striving to excel, yet now my name is being dragged into her unnecessary drama. How can she play the victim when, in reality, I feel like the victim here?

She’s even boasting about it on social media, claiming she was bullied and reported it to HR. How can I defend myself against such baseless accusations when she can’t provide any witnesses or proof that she was bullied?

Let’s say her feelings are valid—she was offended by something she indirectly overheard. But should we always have to adjust our behavior simply because she is so sensitive?

The rules were simple: vote for whichever song you think should be **eliminated** and the last song standing wins.

\-----

***The Avett Brothers (2024)***

1. ~~Never Apart (w/ Vocal Prelude)~~
2. ~~Love Of A Girl~~
3. ~~Cheap Coffee~~
4. ~~Forever Now~~
5. ~~Country Kid~~
6. ~~Orion's Belt~~
7. ~~2020 Regret~~
8. ~~Same Broken Bones~~
9. 👑 We Are Loved

\----------

In the final round ""We Are Loved"" won with 59% of the vote! Seth is redeemed after being shut-out in the *The Third Gleam* survivor.

First, an ode to ""2020 Regret"": I remember a year ago, when we had the tracklist but hadn't yet heard the album many of us feared this song was going to be the ""preachy Seth song about current events that lacks subtlety.""  We were wrong on almost every count: it's a beautiful and poetic Scott track more focused on the 'regret' than the '2020'.  It's a cousin to ""February Seven"" — clear this song was born from lived mistakes but the specifics are opaque, allowing every listener to relate.

It's also secretly a showcase of every member of the extended band: the keys, the strings, the percussion. Scott gets the spotlight but everybody should get the credit.

\----------

""We Are Loved"" is a perfect song. A homerun hit, a winning stand. The more I write the more I risk overexamining the magic trick.

Scott & Seth open and close this self-titled album with hymn-like tracks, the first slightly mournful and this closing masterpiece a peaceful celebration. It lifts the heart, lifts the spirits, and makes me cry on every listen.  If this album is the Avetts' coda on their career it's one hell of a closing remark.

I'm now to the point where I'm afraid to eat because of the pain. That's not an option, because my body struggles to maintain nutrients as it is (due to gastric bypass).

It was a fwb type of situation for two months; I caught feelings, he said we should stay friends and then I ended things. We kept talking and sleeping together on and off in 2022 until we both met other people. My situation didn’t last long but he ended up in a 2 and a half year relationship. I know they broke up sometime last year because we randomly found each other on Hinge in Sept 2024. We both apologized for how we ended things and our immature decisions at the time. He texts me from time to time, he’ll like my IG stories so I feel like he’s slowly trying to establish a friendship- possibly leading to more?? He offered to go out for coffee to catch up and honestly, I’m open to it. 

He was kind of an asshole back then (not in an abusive way, more so an immature player kind of way) but so was I at times. I know he’s a good guy and he seems to have matured based on our convos. I’m honestly curious to see if maybe things would be different meeting at this stage in our lives. We had very similar interests and had fun together back then. I do run the risk of getting hurt, he might still want his ex back. It won’t kill me to find out for myself though.

**HÖLLVANIA CENTRAL MALL UPDATES**

[6b4a40c1a5f5f21f0156ed7d6896a1b2.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/6b4a40c1a5f5f21f0156ed7d6896a1b2.jpg)

**THE ROUND TABLE (NEW PROTOFRAMES)**

It would seem Albrecht Entrati's shadow over Höllvania extends further than previously thought – four brand-new Protoframes are here! **Flare** , **Minerva** , **Velimir** and **Kaya** have moved into **The Round Table** pub in the Höllvania Central Mall and have much to offer visiting Drifters. 

[5344b3bfb86dc54254f4918fbb31210d.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/5344b3bfb86dc54254f4918fbb31210d.png)

After reaching **Rank 4 (Hot and Fresh)** with The Hex Syndicate and finishing **The Hex Quest Finale** , head to the The Round Table pub behind the stage in the Höllvania Central Mall to find these new Protoframes. 

**While they all arrive at the Mall at Rank 4 (Hot and Fresh), you will need to reach Rank 5 (Pizza Party) to interact with Minerva, Velimir, and Kaya.**

Fast travel to these new Vendors is available from the pause menu and from the new “Protoframes” Quick Access Wheel option, with Flare becoming available at Rank 4 (Hot and Fresh) and Minerva & Velimir and Kaya becoming available at Rank 5 (Pizza Party). 

[64699d5f40e04ab66d5641b415d17d0c.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/64699d5f40e04ab66d5641b415d17d0c.jpg)

Each of these new Protoframes also have their own Gemini Skins and Emotes available for purchase in the in-game Market! Learn more about them in the Market Changes & Additions section of the patch notes.

You can also learn more about them with new conversations available in the Pom-2 KIM chat system! All details on that are in the KIM Updates section.

**Flare Varleon**

Flare has transcended merely creating art, and thanks to Albrecht Entrati and the Technocyte Virus, they have become the art. The Protoframe of Temple is a spectacle that has to be seen to be believed. Learn more about the new Warframe Temple further down in the notes! 

Located on the stage at the back of the pub, Flare and their trusted guitar Lizzie are offering **Memorabilia** in exchange for **Beating Heartstrings**. You can obtain Beating Heartstrings from the **NEW GAME MODE: STAGE DEFENSE**. In exchange for Beating Heartstrings, Flare and Lizzie offer:

**Minerva Hendricks**

A former military agent from Libertatia, Minerva is used to her orders being followed… immediately. With cunning and beauty in equal measure, the Protoframe of Saryn has arrived in Höllvania and can be found sitting at the bar of The Round Table with Velimir. 

Minerva’s **Covert Arms** offers the following at Rank 5 (Pizza Party) with The Hex Syndicate: 

  * Purgator 1’s Main Blueprint and Component Blueprints
  * EFV-5 Jupiter’s Main Blueprint and Component Blueprints 
  * EFV-8 Mars’ Main Blueprint and Component Blueprints

**Kaya Velasco**

Capable and cocky, Kaya is an engineering genius, despite being the youngest of the group. The Protoframe of Nova is eager to put her newfound powers of matter manipulation into practice. Kaya has stationed herself just outside The Round Table pub’s entrance, in the small alcove behind the stage. 

Tenno who are **Rank 5 (Pizza Party)** with The Hex will be able to start **Temporal Archimedea** missions through Kaya (learn more in its dedicated section). She also offers the following supplies in exchange for **Pix Chips** , a resource found during Temporal Archimedea:

  * The Quick Access wheel now has all Protoframes grouped into the “Protoframe” category.



**KIM UPDATES**

[8e5fad8f95590f864a2c18513fe85ca3.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/8e5fad8f95590f864a2c18513fe85ca3.png)

**New KIM Conversations: Kaya, Minerva & Velimir, Flare **

There are some new faces around town! The latest Protoframe arrivals not only have The Hex chatting but also… you! Visit the Pom-2 PC in your Base of Operations and hop into the KIM messaging system to start chatting with Flare, Minerva & Velimir (together in a group chat), and Kaya. 

Discover what is haunting Flare and their sorrowful past. Learn more about the tumultuous history between Minerva and Velimir in their group chat as well as their relation to Major Neci Rusalka. Uncover why Kaya is desperate to escape and start fresh far far away from 1999. 

**Prerequisites:**

  * Access to the Pom-2 PC by completing The Hex Quest 
  * Conversations with Flare are available at Rank 4 (Hot & Fresh) with The Hex Syndicate
  * Conversations with Kaya and the group chat with Minerva and Velimir are available at Rank 5 (Pizza Party) with the Hex Syndicate 



New The Hex group chat conversations will also be available after the first time you speak to each of the new Protoframes. 

**Chatting & Rapport**

Like The Hex, **you can chat with each of the new Protoframes once per day (resetting at 0:00 UTC).**

However, unlike The Hex, they are not romanceable. The conversations will have you learning about these characters through the difficult and complex situations they have found themselves in. The narrative goal for you as the Drifter is to help them navigate these trials and mend what's been broken (if you so chose to go that route!). But it won’t be easy and will require you to choose your words carefully in order for them to gain trust with you. With that said, discussions may veer into sensitive topics like mental health, loss, grief, and more. 

Since the goal is not to romance, the Chemistry you earn is more about building rapport with these new Protoframes. If your answers bode well, the messages will have the same gold shimmery text to indicate that you are on the right path. Gifting items from the DirectGiftz Shop to these Protoframes will not increase your Chemistry Rank, as that is tied specifically to the romance system. But who doesn’t love a good Scooticle, right? For that same reason, these Protoframes will also not appear in Bounties. 

As you progress through the conversations and gain rapport, their status with you will change. Unlike The Hex, these conversations occur in a set order, and your Rank will change as you progress through their story. Neutral 

  * Friendly
  * Liked
  * Trusted
  * Close 
  * Associate (if you didn’t succeed at helping them overcome their issue)
  * Best Friends (if you succeed at helping them overcome their issue)



You can view your rank with them in their KIM Profiles. Their profiles will also update with notes as you continue to chat with them to help guide you on what the “correct” replies may be. 

There will be a point in these conversations, where it’ll be clear you have either succeeded or failed in helping to resolve their issues. If you have made all the right choices to help them with their problems there will be certain “events” that occur to indicate that you have been successful in your endeavors. But there’s no fun in spoiling those surprises, so you’ll just have to play through to experience the fruits of your comradery and consulting! 

**Birthday Messages**

Additional conversations are available by connecting with the new Protoframes on their birthdays! Their dates will appear in the 1999 Calendar at Rank 5 (Pizza Party) with The Hex Syndicate. While there is no need to gain Chemistry with these Protoframes, these messages serve as an additional way to connect with — or antagonize — these new characters. 

**NOTE:** With the way 1999 Calendar Seasons are generated, new Protoframe birthdays will not appear on the Calendar until the New Year on April 7 at 0:00 UTC.

**Starting Over**

When the 1999 Calendar resets every month, choosing to forget or remember will also apply to the conversations you have with Kaya, Minerva & Velimir and Flare. For those interested in experiencing all of the possibilities in these new chats, choosing to Forget will reset all conversations (Hex included) back to square one. On that note, we’ve also added a new setting that allows all KIM conversations to play, learn more in General KIM Improvements (read on for details). 

**General KIM Improvements:**

  * The Pom-2 now has the following settings that you can access by selecting the gear icon next to the power button in the bottom right: 



[39420654c91a8fcde775f3df18efbc5f.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/39420654c91a8fcde775f3df18efbc5f.png)

  * **Play All KIM Conversations Toggle:** All available conversations will play in random order within each rank before moving on to the next rank. Reaching higher chemistry will take more time with this toggled on. 
    * Once the toggle is enabled, all conversation will play within your current Rank. So for example, if you are in the Close with Arthur and enable this toggle, all of the conversations in Close (and beyond while enabled) will play. If you wish to play ALL the conversations across all ranks, you will need to forget memories at the 1999 year reset. 
  * **Jump to Next Player Interaction Point Toggle:** Disables the typing animation of Protoframes within the KIM system, automatically jumping ahead to the next player interaction point in all dialogues. 
  * **Background Selection:** Choose from a variety of exciting background images! 
  * The Reset or Remember pop-up at 1999 year-end will now only appear when visiting the KIM section of the Pom-2. 
    * In Hotfix 38.0.8, we added the ability to back out of the reset popup if you weren’t ready to make a decision, but it continued to appear each time you opened up the Pom-2 which could be intrusive to players who were not looking to interact with the KIM system every time. So we changed it to only appear when you select the KIM icon!
  * Adjusted some of the Drifter responses in Eleanor conversations to help avoid confusion that may have driven players to become locked out of dating her too early. 



[eaaf3c11eca86fb5257a6ef0e4eaf72b.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/eaaf3c11eca86fb5257a6ef0e4eaf72b.png)

**NEW HÖLLVANIA MISSION: STAGE DEFENSE**

Flare managed to survive a terrible event at the hands of the Scaldra. Now they’re out to give Höllvania what Viktor was desperate to try to prevent — the sound of resistance resonating through the streets! Ride up and rock out to Flare and Lizzie’s performance at **Solstice Square** providing security to keep the Scaldra off their back during their spectacular set and ultimate act of defiance. 

**How To Access**

After reaching **Rank 4 (Hot and Fresh)** with The Hex Syndicate, interact with the Pom-2 PC in the Orbiter or the Höllvania Central Mall’s garage and select the “NavNow” button to bring up the map. Select **Solstice Square** to play **Stage Defense**. Additionally, Stage Defense can now appear as a Höllvania Bounty!

**How To Play**

Stage Defense works similar to regular Defense, in that you have to protect a target from being destroyed — but in this case, that target is Flare and Lizzie! While rocking out, they’ll blow the sound right out of the speakers scattered around the arena, stunning any enemies in their quake. Cut down any Scaldra who manage to stay standing so the concert never has to stop. Stage Defense lasts for 3 waves of enemies, with the final wave being emboldened with increased Eximus **and** a Scaldra Screamer! 

Scaldra Screamers are overzealous Scaldra units that are willing to blow themselves up to stop Flare and Lizzie from rocking on. Stop them before they can detonate, but beware of their nullifying pulses. Tenno experienced with the Disruption game mode will be familiar with similar enemies, Demolishers — except you’ve probably never had a Demolisher scream in your face, and it’s almost an inevitability with **Scaldra Screamers**.

After three waves, Tenno will be presented with the option to extract or continue fighting. If they choose to continue the show, the stage will collapse into the underground for the encore performance. 

**Rewards**

Stage Defense is the go-to mission for obtaining Temple Warframe Blueprints, as well as Beating Heartstrings, which can be used to make purchases at Flare’s Memorabilia. In addition to normal mission rewards, Tenno will receive 1 Beating Heartstring per 3 waves (or 2 Beating Heartstrings on Steel Path). Since this is an endless mission mode, rewards follow an AABCAABC rotation. Stage Defense follows a similar reward structure to Legacyte Harvest, with each tier of reward (A, B, & C) all having a chance to reward any Blueprint, with later rotations providing a higher chance of receiving a Blueprint.

**All Rotations:**

  * Temple Blueprint & Component Blueprints
  * Riot-848 Component Blueprints



In addition to rewards found in all rotations, each rotation also has their own relics and amount of Endo.

**Rotation A:**

  * 600 Endo
  * Meso Relics



**Rotation B:**

  * 900 Endo
  * Neo Relics



**Rotation C:**

  * 1,200 Endo
  * Axi Relics



**Scaldra Screamers:**

Scaldra Screamers also have a few Arcanes stuffed in their pockets — you’ll find when you stop their shrieking that they end up dropping one! Each Scaldra Screamer will drop one of the following Arcanes:

  * Arcane Bellicose
  * Arcane Crepuscular
  * Arcane Camisado
  * Arcane Impetus
  * Arcane Truculence
  * Melee Doughty
  * Primary Crux
  * Secondary Enervate



For a full list of drop rates, visit the [official Warframe drop tables](https://warframe-web-assets.nyc3.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/uploads/cms/hnfvc0o3jnfvc873njb03enrf56.html).

Backbeat Timing: Invulnerability lasts longer.

**Ability 4 - Exalted Solo**

Once a charge has been built up on the Backbeat metronome, set Lizzie aflame and torch enemies with Heat. While aimed, Lizzie blasts enemies with thunderous elemental sound waves, use ability controls to change the Elemental Damage type.

Backbeat Timing: No Energy consumed. 

**How To Acquire Temple**

  * Temple’s main Blueprint and Component Blueprints can be acquired via the Stage Defense drop tables.

**Temple’s Prex Card**

It ain’t a pub if there’s not some kind of cards lying around the sticky floors. Head to The Round Table pub in the Höllvania Central Mall and see if you can find their Prex Card. Maybe they’ll sign it for you if you ask nicely?

[e1500c28511491b6d6f392375338464b.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/e1500c28511491b6d6f392375338464b.png)

**NEW WEAPONS**

[c4fa205ef467ef5f42d1b032e0f8e100.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/c4fa205ef467ef5f42d1b032e0f8e100.png)

**NEW ADVERSARY: TECHNOCYTE CODA**

The Techrot has found a new way to grow and fester into every corner of Höllvania through the heartthrob sensation On-lyne! It has its grubby tentacles all over their beloved mixtapes and has mutated the band’s data and image into grotesque Techrot copies. Thwart its takeover by chasing down these phony-baloney On-lyne wannabees and be rewarded for doing so! Arthur Nightingale has kindly offered his guidance to you via transmissions to see that you are successful in eradicating the infection. 

**Technocyte Coda Prerequisites**

  * Completed all main Quests up to and including The Hex Quest 
    * You need access to the Höllvania missions in order to participate in the Technocyte Coda system. 
  * No active Kuva Lich or Sister of Parvos 
    * Only 1 Adversary can be active at a time. If you have an active Adversary, you will not see Mixtapes in Höllvania missions that are the key to generating your Technocyte Coda. This however will not impact your squadmates ability to spawn their own if they do not have an active Adversary. 



**How To Get A Technocyte Coda**

First and foremost its important to note that all stages on the path to clearing your Technocyte Coda (aside from the final showdown in Earth Proxima) will specifically occur on the following Höllvania missions and Bounties: 

  * Exterminate (Rhu Manor & Mausoleum East)
  * Hell-Scrub (Old Konderuk and Mischta Rampart) 
  * Legacyte Harvest (Köbinn West)



These missions will appear surrounded by green Techrot infection in the Pom-2 NavNow map screen. Technocyte Coda activity will never occur in the H-09 Efervon Tank Assassination, Solstice Square Defense and Faceoff (both Squad vs. Squad and Single Squad) missions to avoid disrupting mission objectives.

**1\. Upload Mixtape**

Kill Techrot enemies to acquire a dropped**Mixtape** in Exterminate, Hell-Scrub and Legacyte Harvest Höllvania missions and Bounties - they’ll be marked with a unique waypoint. Picking up the Mixtape will mark the terminals where you can upload it and complete the hack. 

[7ad128c579109c6a3f4788f586c6768a.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/7ad128c579109c6a3f4788f586c6768a.png)

You will generate a Technocyte Coda regardless of if you fail or succeed the hack, but additional events will occur based on how you perform: 

  * Fail: Generate Technocyte Coda, but Techrot enemies are notified of your attempt and will spawn in to confront you. 
  * Succeed: Generate Technocyte Coda and there’s a small chance to be rewarded with a**Potency** **Mod**(learn more in the Malware Disinfection section). 



Like any good band, they’ve got plenty of mixtapes to go around so each time you go to spawn a Technocyte Coda the Mixtape title will be randomized. Who wouldn’t want to jam out to “ButteryPenguine” and “BizkitBounce”? Just to name a few! 

Upon returning from the mission, your Technocyte Coda will introduce themselves. Each band has a randomly generated band name and color scheme, as well as a dedicated **Frontman**(more on them in the Technocyte Coda Concert section). Any of the Technocyte copies of On-lyne members are eligible to be the Frontman, and you’ll know who has taken up the mantle as their name will be prefixed in the band title. 

  * HARDDRIVE_ 
  * ZEKE_
  * DRILLBIT_
  * PACKET_
  * DJROM_

They’ll also be front and center in the Technocyte Coda screen! This screen will also indicate their weaknesses, resistances and immunities, rewards for defeating them, Malware Disinfection progress and Antivirus attempts – all of which we’ll cover in the following sections! You can access this screen at any time by selecting the Technocyte Coda button in the pause menu or by selecting the “Repair” button in the POM-2’s MALWARE FOUND popup. 

[c35ddec88a086907be60f5da717076b6.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/c35ddec88a086907be60f5da717076b6.png)

Unlike Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos, the progenitor Warframe (the Warframe you have equipped at the time of Adversary generation) does not have an impact on your Technocyte Coda. With Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos, this would determine the Valence Bonus of the Kuva/Tenet weapon you earn from Vanquishing them. But with the Technocyte Coda system, Coda Weapons are not directly acquired from the Coda themselves, but rather from Eleanor for a new special currency called Live Heartcells, rewarded from Vanquishing Technocyte Codas. More on that in the Technocyte Coda Rewards section. 

Technocyte Coda Debuff: The Coda Cyst! 

Your Technocyte Coda will make sure you don’t forget that you are both in an endless chase! Unlike Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos that have Reward Tax, a **Technocyte Cyst** will appear on all your Warframes until your Coda is defeated. 

[33c9682f08324dbfd8cd475043543f47.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/33c9682f08324dbfd8cd475043543f47.jpg)

This juicy green boil protruding from the neck will grow bigger with each Höllvania mission completed while you have a Technocyte Coda active. Only defeating them will Disinfect your Warframes and rid them of that atrocious fashion killer! 

It is possible to have both a Helminth and a Technocyte Cyst at the same time. You can still drain the Helminth Cyst in the Helminth chair as usual to remove it, but the Technocyte Cyst will remain until you defeat your Technocyte Coda. 

**2\. Malware Disinfection**

The journey to defeating your Technocyte Coda involves **Malware Disinfection** and, like any smart web surfer, you start by finding the best **Antivirus** software you can find! 

**The goal is to bring your Technocyte Coda’s Malware Disinfection to 100%.** This will prompt them to flee to Earth Proxima for their final performance and your final dance with them (more on that in the Technocyte Coda Concert section). 

**How to Increase Malware Disinfection:**

  * Malware Disinfection increases by 5% after completing Exterminate, Hell-Scrub and Legacyte Harvest Höllvania missions/Bounties OR after injecting your Technocyte Coda with the correct **Antivirus Mod** during a **Duet**. 
  * You can increase the amount of Malware Disinfection earned from correctly injecting your Coda with the use of **Potency Mods.**



You can view your Malware Disinfection progress in the Technocyte Coda screen. 

[74ab0e2bf77f62d654128c5bb76366c9.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/74ab0e2bf77f62d654128c5bb76366c9.png)

**Anti****v****irus & Potency Parazon Mods**

There are two types of Parazon Mods that are used to increase Malware Disinfection: **Antivirus** and **Potency**! 

[e282ea792561080de924f263431b587c.png](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/e282ea792561080de924f263431b587c.png)

**Antivirus Mods**

Before taking on your Technocyte Coda in a Duet, you’ll first want to equip your Parazon with Antivirus Mods! 

These are the 1999 equivalent of Requiem Mods for Kuva Liches and Sisters of Parvos. Except, instead of needing to stab your Adversary with the correct Requiem mods in the correct order, **you only need 1 of the Antivirus Mods to be correct to increase Malware Disinfection**. Meaning, regardless of where you have placed the correct Antivirus Mod in your Parazon you will gain Malware Disinfection upon injecting the Duet. 

Unlike Kuva Liches/Sisters of Parvos, failing to have the correct Antivirus Mod will not increase the strength of your Technocyte Coda. The only consequence for failing is not gaining Malware Disinfection. 

**Antivirus attempts** are tracked in the Technocyte Coda screen, as well as in your Parazon upgrade screen to inform you of which of the Antivirus Mods has successfully increased Malware Disinfection and which have not. From there you can equip/unequip mods until you find the correct Antivirus Mod! 

[1424ccaaf983ade4cbc6aafb0e962266.jpg](https://www-static.warframe.com/uploads/1424ccaaf983ade4cbc6aafb0e962266.jpg)

There are a total of 8 Antivirus Mods, each a brand of 1999 Antivirus software: 

  * **ByteRyte** : Keeps your bytes tight and your bits fit
  * **Worm Away** : Get rid of malware, spyware, wetware and worms
  * **Trojan Tracker:** Eliminating sneaky viruses since 1989
  * **Keep-Clean:** There’s no Clean like Keep-Clean
  * **Drive-Duster:** Your digital virus buster
  * **Soft Safe:** Keeping software safe by ALWAYS WATCHING
  * **Anti-V** : Digital extremists stand no chance when you have Anti-V on your side 
  * **Computer Cop:** Stopping cyber-crime in its tracks

**Potency Mods**

These are used to, you guessed it, increase the **Potency** of the Malware Disinfection injected into your Technocyte Coda when the correct Antivirus Mod is equipped. They are completely optional and are not required to successfully defeat your Technocyte Coda, but they sure will make the process faster! They also each come with a special secondary effect. 

There are a total of 5 Potency Mods: 

  * **Immuno Shield** : Gain 15% Disinfection and gain 5000 Affinity 
  * **Instant Secure** : Gain 15% Disinfection and gain 10,000 Höllars 
  * **Quick Correct:** Gain 10% Disinfection and 10% chance to drop a Live Heartcell 
  * **Threat Blocker:** Gain 10% Disinfection and 25% chance to drop a Potency Mod 
  * **Turbo Protect** : Gain 10% Disinfection and 25% chance to drop an Antivirus Mod



To get you started, we suggest equipping Antivirus Mods into all three of the Parazon slots for higher chance of finding the correct one in Duet encounters. Once you have found it, you can swap out the two incorrect Antivirus Mods for whichever Potency Mods you like!

**Antivirus/Potency Mod Charges:**

Each of the Antivirus and Potency Mods have three charges. Once all three charges have been consumed, the mod becomes corrupted and will no longer provide its listed effects.",62,1742396672.0,Warframe,27,1.0,False
1jez1gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/1jez1gf/feeling_a_bit_better_now/,Feeling a bit better now..,"So I quit over the weekend without giving two weeks notice for various reasons. Yesterday was bad in terms of guilt and freaking out about money but today, things are gong much better. As an art teacher, and since it's mercury retrograde, I approached an old private adult student who is abroad and she purchase private lessons in bulk, and now I'm working on reintroducing a teaching / business idea I once did, which is basically en Plein air (in the open air, drawing painting). I live in a touristy, historic and quaint walkable town, so I'm working on building a web landing page and tickets for each Saturday's class. Hopefully, it will pan out financially better than it did previously. I'm changing things around so it works better. I'm going to do UpWork for illustration and send out a few applications to art organizations. 

Anyway, now that I am officially 3 days away from my official resignation from this school, I find myself laughing at the expectations that they wanted from me without any support. A private Catholic school lies about the position, I sign contract, boom!, 27 classes a week, over 600 students, no budget for art supplies and some students own half the town. The principal never once asked me how I was doing the entire year. I only saw her once when she reprimanded me for leaving students out in the hall for five minutes while I cleaned the classroom from the mess the previous class left... lol. I mean who were they kidding? Is it any wonder I was cracking? At least I have my peace. Today I woke up, sent my daughter off to school and sipped coffee while listening to the birds.

I read something else here that brought me great comfort tho. There are only 5-6,000 redditors on this subreddit (from Canada, US, AUS, Europe etc etc). In the US alone, there are 50-60,000 fistula cases a year. We have a VERY limited view of the process here on this subreddit. And by default, many who come here are going to be in a state of distress, or dealing with unusual healing compared to the average of those 60,000 people. 

Anywho, this morning I am up and about and I’m drinking my favourite coffee, and I’m very gently dancing to music while I make oatmeal. 13 days ago I had a flap and I had my moments of emotional distress and hopelessness. Ride those waves people! Like most things in life, it gets better. 

Was the flap fun? No… the first few days were rough. But I didn’t expect it to be easy, and I DID IT. I’m capable of hard things, just like anyone else. You can do this, I can do this. It might not be linear and it sure as hell won’t be easy; but we can do this. 

Last thought, I encourage ALL of us here to pause before commenting something negative about our own experience unless specifically asked. I have posted a couple times and had people say “oh day 5, that’s happening, I’m sorry I think it failed” or something similarly negative based on their own experience….ultimately unrelated to my post. 

Safe to say most of us aren’t doctors, and over the weeks I’ve read countless stories of people thinking a procedure failed and then weeks or even months later they come back to update they were wrong & it worked! Commenting on failure should be very selective as it is one of the most discouraging things to read here for many and is impossible to gauge through a Reddit post.

In our attic, we have the drainage system that I tried to capture in the picture. It's all 40mm (1.56"") and goes to the main sewage/drainage pipe. Ever since we had a bathtub (and basin) installed, we have had issues with the bath taking a (very) long time to drain, and with dirty water from the washer coming up in the bath. Either through the bottom or if it's closed, through the overflow pipe.

Lately we are using the attic as a temporary kitchen/living room so we're using it a lot more, and we noticed that a sewage smell is coming from the bath/basin when the drainage has been used. Remains of coffee grounds that are washed away in the basin end up in the bathtub when the washer finishes the cycle. 

I suspect a partial blockage in the pipe that's in the concrete floor (maybe because of long hair from the bathtub, or sand from the washer), but I can't access it with a drain snake from the bathtub or basin because of the 90 degree angles. Most of the pipes aren't accessible anyways because it's behind the vanity.  And maybe the water filling the pipes pushes the sewage air through the P-traps as it has nowhere to go, resulting in the stench? 

Any suggestions how I can fix the issues I'm having? In the past (don't shoot) I had some measure of succes with using compressed air on the bath drain, ductaping over the boiler/washer/dryer and overflow holes. It improved bath draining times, but only for a while and never to the point where it seems unobstructed. The last attempt didn't make a difference though. Suction doesn't work due to the AAV which lets air in, but I could wrap a bag around it temporarily. But since it's not fully blocked, it would probably not work anyways.

FWIW, the length of the drain in the concrete floor is probably around 5-7 meters (\~20ft).",1,1742396451.0,Plumbing,0,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1jeyyh1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1jeyyh1/alkemia_first_impressions_of_17_scents_from_a/,Alkemia - first impressions of 17 scents from a masculine perspective,"I am so sorry this is going to be very long. 

I recently received a sample set of 17 Alkemia scents (oil based). International shipping to Australia was fast and they were beautifully packaged, and quite affordable given the exchange rate and everything. I appreciate that Alkemia shows pricing in AUD and it's one of the reasons I bought from them. That said, shipping will cost me a fortune if I ever decide I want to get full bottles :(

I let my samples rest for a minimum of 3 days before testing. A few developed more nuance within the first couple of days, but it's now been about 2 weeks with no further changes. 

For context, my fragrance preferences: photorealistic nature scents, complex and weird scents, Gothic and melancholy atmospherics, darker notes like leather, incense, resins/amber; tobacco, tea, woods, pine, greenery, indolic florals. I can’t usually wear gourmands and sweet florals. I prefer scents I can smell on myself easily and last most of the day, but don't fill the room or stick around after showering.

I’ve been in the perfume game a while and gotten quite good at picking samples I’ll like based on the notes, to a point where an 80% hit rate is normal for me if I do my research properly. With Alkemia I only had a 50% hit rate. I go into the reasons why at the end of my post. It all comes down to the house DNA not vibing with my skin and personal tastes, but even so I did pretty well out of this haul and I can't deny I'm tempted to order more samples now that I know which scent profiles from Alkemia work for me (spoiler: it's the woody-amber, petrichor and - surprisingly - gourmand ones).

Below are my initial impressions, which I've split into categories based on scent profile - scents in each category are ordered from least to most liked. I use a 10 point rating system, in short, anything below a 5 is a dislike of varying degrees, 5-6 is mixed feelings, 7-8 is a “like but not totally my thing”; 9-10 is full bottle worthy.

# FRESH FEMME FLORALS  

**Whisper of Stars:** I was so excited for this one cause I love jasmine tea, but on me it smells like piercingly soapy laundry detergent and the jasmine tea is barely recognizable. This only really becomes pleasant in the drydown when it mellows out a bit into a clean linen scent. **4/10** scent, **2/10** performance

**Silver Sky:** Probably the best composition and performance from this category, but to me it just smells like a nice women's body lotion or deodorant. I'm guessing it's mostly lily of the valley I'm smelling. I don't get any tea-like notes. I'm disappointed I'm not getting any of the complexity in this. **6/10** scent, **3/10** performance. 

**Love unforeseen (freebie):** This is a pretty, fresh white floral that’s initially pretty similar to Midnight Garden. The performance is abysmal on me. It reminds me so much of one of my favorite niche scents, La Dompteuse Encagee by Serge Lutens, that I ended up spraying that on over the top and it just felt like I'd amplified Love Unforeseen. **7/10** scent, **2/10** performance

**Midnight Garden:** The opening blast of this is the most gorgeous rich white floral scent (and STRONG), but all the complexity here is in the first few seconds and after that it’s just gardenia. It dries down to a generic soapy scent without ever really projecting more than an inch off my skin. This is one that definitely feels like it would benefit from layering over a more base-heavy scent. I did actually try layering it with Winterling, which made it project a little more but all it really did was add a layer of creaminess to the Winterling scent profile, and it still disappeared quite fast. More experimentation needed. **8/10** scent, **1/10** performance.

# “TRADITIONALLY MASCULINE” SCENTS

**Esprit de la Terre:** An unusual herbal/spicy masc freshie. Dry coriander seeds and black tea leaves. There's something weirdly delicious about it in a savoury way. This one projects decently but evaporates fast. **6.5/10** scent, **3/10** performance

**Bibliotheca:** I love this so much! It's not what I was expecting, it doesn't smell like a library to me, and I can't detect any of the listed notes. In fact, I can't pick out any notes at all. It's just an… ambience. To me it smells like a club where wealthy men go to lose money on their favorite sport. Since I can't detect any individual notes, I'll just list some vague associations: smooth, round, dark, blue. Might remind me of my grandad’s yacht, because for some reason I’m getting ocean vibes even though it’s not aquatic. **9/10** scent, **7/10** performance

# GREEN SOAPS 

**Earthlight:** Really just smells like a hippie-ish herbal soap. It’s a pleasant scent but I’m not inspired by soap. Incredibly light, doesn't project at all and fades to a skin scent almost immediately. **6/10** scent, **1/10** performance.

**Moss maiden:** This isn't super soapy, but it's so sanitised that I can't associate it with any natural environment. It smells like moss grown hydroponically - very clean, fresh, juicy, wet, and cold in a non-mentholic way. It reminds me a bit of aloe vera gel. I actually like it a lot, it would be a lovely refreshing scent for a hot day, but it's barely detectable and fades soooo fast. **8/10** scent, **1/10** performance

# PINE 

**In a northern wood:** This is similar to Falling Stars (reviewed below), but woodier, fresher and less sweet. As it dries down, it gets a tiny bit of smokiness to it. It's a little soapy, in the sense that I could imagine a soap being scented like this, but it doesn't seem aldehydic. I really like it, but it doesn't perform well on me. **8.5/10** scent, **1/10** performance

**Falling stars on winter solstice:** My absolute favorite of all the samples and absolutely full bottle worthy! This one is beast mode but takes 3 hours to warm up; apply sparingly. It opens with a very green frankincense and dries down to a luminous, translucent amber. Pine is present throughout. It's magical and suits its name. It has a sense of awe about it - you're a shepherd seeing the star at Christmas, you're watching the northern lights, something like that. **10/10** scent, **10/10** performance

# NICHE ATMOSPHERICS 

**Incense of a new church:** This is “your skin but better” for robots. In the opening there's an acrid plasticky note that reminds me of film rolls, but it softens to a warm ambience of industrial lubricant oil. I don't get anything actually metallic. This was a really interesting scent experience and a great piece of art but I don't think I can wear anything this synthetic-smelling without getting a headache. **6/10** scent, **6/10** performance

**St Louis cemetery:** In the bottle this smells exactly like paint thinner so I was a bit worried, but on skin it softens into a really impressive petrichor and rain drenched pavement smell. In the drydown I smell a gorgeous patchouli which I'm pretty sure is being used to create the petrichor accord. This is one of only a few Alkemia scents I've tried that doesn't smell like it's trying to have mass appeal. They didn't hold back with the photorealism here. However, it is very weak and short lasting. **9/10** scent, **1/10** performance

**Writers blood:** This smells like biro ink, or metal pen nibs and artist's ink, plus black coffee. It's unapologetically dark and bitter and metallic, I love it. I don't smell blood but that's probably because I'm just interpreting the metallic notes as metal writing implements. There’s also something about it that reminds me of a hospital (which would normally disturb me) but I somehow don’t mind it. In the bottle this is the strongest of the entire sample set (I got one drop on a tissue and could smell it throughout the house for days, it also somehow spread all over the sample envelope) but on skin, it's surprisingly subtle. I'd be inclined to wear it on clothing to get more out of it, as it seems practically eternal on any surface it touches. **10/10** scent, **6/10** performance (on skin)

# GOURMANDS

**As dark things are meant to be loved:** This is a rich decadent fruit cake with coffee on the side. It's dark in a gourmand sort of way. I don't normally do gourmands but I'm starting to see a pattern that if it's got coffee in it, I'm going to like it. This one is really yummy and I enjoy it though I probably wouldn't wear it often. It dries down to a pretty classic woody amber, a la Serge Lutens Ambre Sultan, etc. **8/10** scent, **6/10** performance

**Candybox alchemy (freebie):** If you told me this was a dupe of Kayali Vanilla 28 I’d believe it. But Vanilla 28 turned sickenly cloyingly sweet on me and this didn’t. It starts of with what I interpret as cream soda and glace cherry notes, then progresses to a vanilla icecream with a hint of something floral, fresh and almost green close to the skin, and finally in the drydown you get a sweet floral that has a slight earthiness to it, which I think is orchid. It has really good performance - I can smell it easily in a bubble around me and it’s still going strong 4 hours later. Not rating higher because I still wouldn’t wear this often due to my tastes but it’s incredibly well crafted. **8/10** scent, **9/10** performance.

# UNCATEGORISED 

**The highwayman:** I couldn't smell this one properly (I explain why at the end of the post). I got the briefest burst of a beautiful fresh leather in the opening which disappeared too fast. Then I mostly got rich black tea (maybe this is just how I'm interpreting the soil note? It read very sweet to me). There's definitely lavender in the air accord. I don't hate it but it just smells wrong somehow. It sticks around for a good long time though it’s not a super strong scent - I was still getting faint whiffs the next morning, although by that point it was just a generic perfumey scent, possibly violets. Maybe I'll let it rest more and try again another time. I really want more of that fleeting leather! **5/10** scent, **7/10** performance.

**Attorney for lost souls:** I was really unsure about this one in the bottle. It smelled too much like cooking spices and the oily clove note rubbed me the wrong way. However, on skin I found it soothing. The clove oil is a bit strong at first but it mellows out leaving a beautiful spicy-citrus-incense similar to a gorgeous oil blend I have called Meditation Oil which is very relaxing and uplifting, except that one is a lot more complex with florals and more spices. Attorney for Lost Souls is less nuanced, but has its own charm. I can see myself wearing this often, the only reason I don’t rate it higher is because I already have a similar scent that is superior. **8.5/10** scent, **5/10** performance

**Winterling (freebie):** Opens with a very photorealistic green mint like you've crushed fresh mint leaves. There's a warm vanillic woody base and wafts of lavender and maybe a tiny bit of rosehip. Weirdly the accord I get most from this is something like marzipan - even though it has no gourmand notes listed, it reminds me of almond cake. It's unexpectedly complex and very interesting, cosy, but not overly sweet. Does smell a bit like a scented candle, which would normally annoy me, but I enjoy this enough to forgive it. **9/10** scent, **6/10** performance



Now the issues I had with Alkemia scents (disclaimer: fragrance is highly subjective, and this reflects my personal olfactory experience and skin chemistry only):

* Many of them are so weak and short lived on my skin that I couldn't smell them at all without either waving my arms vigorously in front of my face, or actually pressing my nose up to my skin. Usually oils perform better than EDPs on me so this was surprising.
* Many of them have a scent profile that smells like soap, candles, or a body wash/lotion/deodorant. I was hoping for more photorealistic nature scents, but I think this is just an aesthetic choice by Alkemia that clashes with my personal taste.
* A few of them dried down to a strange mildewy or ashy scent on my skin, like a wet ashtray (Falling Stars, Midnight Garden, In a Northern Wood)
* A few of them have the same weird papery floral base note that makes it hard for me to smell the actual heart of the fragrance (most notably The Highwayman, but also Incense of a New Church, Esprit de la Terre). It feels like looking at the perfume through a gauze curtain. I think this must be a common base note that my skin amplifies.
* All of them seem to slightly trigger my asthma on initial application, but this might not be the fault of this specific house as I sometimes go through phases where my lungs are extra sensitive.

1jeyxt8,https://www.reddit.com/r/emmachamberlain/comments/1jeyxt8/the_reason_for_everything_or_most_is_quarantine/,the reason for everything (or most) is quarantine.,"after reading many of the posts here and rewatching old videos, i think that the main reason for the big change is quarantine. it took time for the effect to take, but hear me out.

quarantine had paused the world for almost three years. other than keeping people stuck at home, so many projects and endeavors had to be paused, discarded, altered. emma was stuck in her house in la, and during this time we grew to love her more and more, her vlogs doing the nothing we had all been doing, having the peak of the day going to the grocery store. most of her interviews were on zoom, and yes, she had some photoshoots but it's nothing compared to the amount she has now. so she was home, like we were. there was nothing to be alarmed by. chabmerlain coffee was online only (she did mention one time a fantasy about opening a cafe, i bet my life this cafe should have been opened years before but quarantine stopped it from happening), and many things were put on hold. some things took years to relaunch and could not bounce back to where quarantine paused them. how happy would we all be if she kept making the same type of videos, where she goes to whole foods and the beach and calls it a day? it would be so lovely and comforting. bake muffins and play with her cats week after week. but the world has finally opened and she had to move and grow.

my point - i think if quarantine had not happened, emma would have been in a completely different place a long time ago and the pain we all feel from her youtube inconsistency, her change in attitude that seems quite sudden, all of that would have happened long ago. if she didn't have to be home so much she would not have posted weekly videos. what could she have done? she did what she could to support herself financially.

Moving to Australia is exciting, but there are some things we wish we knew earlier! If you're planning to come here (or already struggling), this post is for you!

🏠 1. Renting is a Nightmare – It’s not like India where you just pay and move in. You need rental history, references, and even a cover letter!

💰 2. Everything is Super Expensive – $10 for a coffee? $400+ weekly rent? Welcome to Australia! 😅

🚗 3. Public Transport is Not That Great – It’s expensive and unreliable outside big cities. Many Indians end up buying a car ASAP.

👩‍⚕️ 4. Medical is Free (But Slow!) – Medicare covers most things, but getting a doctor’s appointment can take weeks!

💼 5. Jobs are Harder to Get Than Expected – Just applying online isn’t enough. Networking, LinkedIn, and referrals matter a lot!

🍛 6. Cooking at Home Saves a Fortune – Eating out often kills your budget. Even simple Indian meals cost $20+ in restaurants!

👕 7. No One Cares About Fancy Clothes – Unlike India, even professionals dress casually. T-shirt and shorts are normal at work!

🌏 8. Australia is HUGE! – Visiting another city isn’t like traveling from Mumbai to Pune. Flights are expensive, and road trips take forever!

Flooding has hit the city of Alingle following a major hurricane that caused the overflow of the Hekko Dam, an evacuation was carried out by city officials before the water hit, though with the unexpectedly high levels the damage extended beyond what was evacuated. Despite this reports suggest that due to the slow moving nature, actual fatalities are low, with the primary issue being property damage. We will report more on this as we have more information.

so this has kinda been building for a while. I have been with my boyfriend  for about a year. we moved in together four months ago, and ever since then I have felt like I'm losing my mind.

at first, it was small things like my phone charger wouldn’t be where I left it or a cup I'd set down would end up on the wrong counter things I chalked it up to me being tired or distracted but it’s just gotten worse.

I have a little notebook where I write down reminders and grocery lists. one morning, I was sure I wrote down ""milk, eggs, coffee,"" but later when I checked, the coffee was crossed out and dish soap was written in handwriting that kind of looked like mine but messier, brushed that off again.

then my jewelry started moving. I have rings in a little container in my bathroom but two of them ended up in my sock drawer. again, brushed it off.

but last night was too much. I have a stuffed bear that I like for sentimental reasons. I keep it on a shelf in our room. when I got home from work it was on the floor by the front door like someone had just dropped it there. I know I didn’t move it.

I went to my bf asking if he has been moving my stuff. he laughed and said I was being paranoid. I pressed him and he got annoyed, saying I must just be stressed and forgetful. I got upset and told him I felt like I was being gaslit. he got really offended, saying I was accusing him of something cruel when he's been nothing but supportive.

now I feel awful and I’m not sure if I was overreacting. he has been extra quiet today and I’m starting to wonder if I’m just going crazy tbh. aitah???

(in Montreal btw)

my usual buy of nuts to snack on are all made in the US - mixed nuts bag, almonds, cashews, walnuts. only thing I could find were Tamari Almonds which are “packaged in Canada”. better than nothing I guess.

most protein bars are made in the US. managed to find SimplyProtein which are made in Canada.

so many cereal are made in the US. was surprised at this as well.

finally, the Van Houtte tin of pre-grounded coffee… made in the US. a canadian coffee company is making their coffee in the US. ended up buying the Kirkland brand since its imported from Colombia by their Ottawa importing branch.

so yeah, was surprised that shopping non-American was more difficult than expected. Dont know if this is the case across all grocery stores in Canada or just a Costco specific issue",55,1742395683.0,CostcoCanada,58,0.77,False
1jeypbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1jeypbr/additional_supplements_to_help_with_the_feel_free/,Additional Supplements To Help With the Feel Free Induced Insomnia,"Hey guys (and girls),

Currently on Day 3 CT for the 100th time probably.  3-4 bottle daily user in the past for 2 1/2 years.  The lengthy, ridiculous, horrendous, insomnia is always the worse withdrawal side effect that I always deal with.  And as a married man with a high school student living at my house, and with my career, the insomnia makes it impossible to function for at least a week after every quit.  And after a day or two of being up all night, my very understanding wife is becoming more and more less understanding.

Anyway, besides the standard supplement protocol that many people post here and that you can find on this page.  I have found three additional supplements that are actually making a very noticeable difference working through the insomnia and making it possible to function during the day in the first few days after your quit.  They are not miracle workers and you are still going to have to go through the insomnia for a while after quitting, but taking a dose of creatine, coenzyme Q10 and choline supplements in the mornings with coffee and breakfast have made a world of difference this time.  All three have brain health benefits.  But I never knew before doing some recent research that creatine did as well.  Everybody knows about creatine for bodybuilding and work-out benefits, but research shows additional brain health benefits when taking creatine...  specifically, improving sleep, reducing mental fatigue and brain fog.  Just Google ""creatine brain benefits"" for an AI Overview.  Creatine has a ton of additional brain health benefits as well.

Hope this helps somebody.

Just to be clear, I plugged it, inserted a pod and when I closed it, the button started blinking red.

Tried about everything I found on the internet, cleaned the water needle to make sure there is no blockage, manually spun the machine and cleaned it to the best of my abilities, it was not that dirty after 2 cups :)

Tried the factory reset, hold button then plug it in, tried to start the rinsing, nothing helped. 

As soon as I plug it and do any movement or action with it, it blinks red. I cant rinse, cant descale or do anything for it to even make a sound... 

If you had a similar issue and fixed it, let me know. First purchase and I'm kinda disappointed, reading more articles on how problematic these machines are did not make the experience better haha.

Find me weird?”

If you're traveling through the area and want an authentic taste of Dominican agriculture, this is the place to go!

Unlike the expensive, polished tours that barely scratch the surface, this farm visit was personal, immersive, and eye-opening. The owner Santa walked us through their land, showing us cacao trees, different coffee varieties, vanilla vines, oregano, bananas, pineapples, and many more. They explained every step of the process -- from harvesting to roasting -- so we could truly appreciate the craftsmanship behind Dominican coffee and chocolate.

The best part? Their products are amazing. The coffee is rich and aromatic, the caramelized chocolates are smooth and flavorful, and the cacao tea is one of the best I’ve had. Instead of paying a fortune for a generic tour, I’d highly recommend renting a car from the airport in Punta Cana (around 60 USD), driving to the farm, and directly supporting this hardworking family. If you only speak English, ask for Santa. She’s super friendly and will guide you through everything!

If you love coffee, chocolate, and authentic travel experiences, this spot is a must-visit. Have any of you done something similar while traveling? Let’s swap recommendations!

The only interesting that happened was some drunk ass dude disturbed a few animals, and I was so pissed because he didn't listen to my commands, that I had to force him to exit outside. Damn, I just wanna crush that dude's head..

Anyways, uh, nothing much, later fellas.

Okay, this is quite weird..

I just woke up to a *really* faint noise coming from below the tower, sounds something like a wheezing sheep, I'm actually terrified right now lmao XD

However, it has a number of annoyances that make this feature extremely annoying:

* The lights turn on when you choose the Bike activity, even before you start it
* If the lights are in range, they turn on when you choose other activities, as well as (e.g., a walk)
* The lights don't shut off until you return to the main screen; at the end of an activity, you have to actually go through the activity review, and go back to the main screen, all while standing next to the bike

This behavior seriously reduces the utility of the feature. My watch will occasionally turn them on when I am walking by my garage, and then I will find out the next day when the batteries are drained. I think it should work like this instead:

* The lights turn on only when you *start* the activity
* The lights Turn off when you pause or end the activity (e.g., for a coffee break or quick trip into a gas station on a long ride)
* (Obviously) only be activated for cycling

Im looking for someone who is 20+, and who is literate and above! I love making detailed responses since I am passionate about the characters I play.

I am looking for a Slice of Life Romance roleplay with any drama elements, action is also welcome but I prefer not to have fantasy. I am also extremely active, and I love talking OOC! I also prefer to roleplay on discord due to notification problems on Reddit. 

I am okay with having dramatic elements and angsty stuff in the roleplays, however I want it to be more focused on the fluff and romance aspect between the two characters so we can focus on character development! 

I’m a literate-adv.lit role player, however I can adjust my style to fit yours! I only play my oc’s and I only write in 3rd person, so I would prefer if my partners wrote in 3rd person as well. I’m also fairly active so please communicate with me if you have to leave or if you’re no longer interested. 

I also tend to prefer MxM or FxF but MxF is fine with me! I can play any gender and I have an assortment of characters that I made I can choose from. I do have some plot ideas! 

Plot 1- (MxM) An FBI agent finally has a well earned day off when he meets someone at a bar, instead of being an expected one night stand, it ends up being a meaningful conversation. However, due to his high risk job, he struggles to get close to him. 

Plot 2- (MxM or MxF) An Intelligent professor is trying a new hobby of music, yet he is at a constant struggle of skill and previous perfectionism when his music mentor finally helps him out with more lessons and they grow closer than they ever realized. 

Plot 3- (MxM) A meet cute between a baker and a regular customer who become closer as time goes on, even with the up and downs of owning a small business. 

Plot 4- (FxM or FxF) Two Doctors at a hospital are always at odds with eachother, to the point a tally is being kept of how often they take over each other’s patients, this is more so a rivals to lovers.

Plot 5- (FxF) A fashion designer falls for one of her regular models, even though they can only talk from a distance due to their respective fame, they have a secret relationship between shows. 

Plot 6- (MxM) An undercover idol frequents a coffee shop and grows close to the barista, one day paparazzi finds him there and the Barista finds out who he is but still hides him from the paparazzi until they leave, this would be a sweeter but slightly angsty romance. 

Feel free to comment or DM me if you’re interested and we can talk about anything we need to cover, also if you have any plot ideas, I would love to hear them as well!

He was having problems with cross addiction and I had just come out of a relapse of mine and thought I could help and support him stopping. 

So we started texting and talking and it quickly became all day every day and into the night, which was fine, but then he started wanting to date me, and I said no thanks as I am just out of a really toxic relationship (and to be honest I just don't find him sexually attractive, but I didn't want to hurt his feelings) I said I still value his friendship and want to offer support as a friend.

He really struggled with the rejection and kind of won't take no for an answer. Every interaction has become so awkward in person because he keeps pushing boundaries, like giving me a hug on a park bench then keeping his hand on my hip and buying me extravagant gifts, INSISTING on paying for coffees, lunchs ect... sounds great but it's really not because it makes me so uncomfortable and I am not a materialistic kind of person. I also am scared of saying no to him because of his extreme reactions to when I do.

For example we were out having a coffee, and he wanted a picture of the two of us, I said sure. then he said I'm going to make it my profile picture, and I asked that he didn't because we are not dating and it would me me feel uncomfortable. His change in demeanor was instant he went quiet, stopped eating, got up and just started walking off, like just wandering down the street. He didn't know the area or have any idea of where he was going!

He texts me non stop all hours and gets upset if I don't reply in 10 minutes, one time I got up in the night to use the toilet and checked my phone and the next day he was calling me out on being up and not texting him, it's all too much!! Every time he texts me my heart drops, and every time I text back I feel this floor of relief that I won't have to text him again for 5 minutes.

I am scared to block him because the one time I did he took an overdose and was admitted to hospital. The reason I blocked him is because he was upset at me for having a casual relationship with someone, he called me every name under the sun and accused me of laughing at him with this guy, which I wasn't and would never do.

I also do like him as a friend and feel compassionate for his suffering, I know it's not his fault he acts like this, but at the same time I hate it and find it exhausting...

Could anyone offer me some advice on how to navigate this? I feel so depressed and anxious

What do you prefer to do on the first date ? And do you ever approach the man for the first date at all , or is it something you expect the man to do ? 

I know some women are confident enough to approach men themselves but i understand that some aren't that comfortable yet . 

Also let's say a guy asked for your number , you've been chatting for a few days/weeks and you've liked him enough , do you prefer that he makes the first move/asks you out first or do you suggest a first date yourself?

I didn't know this at first , but I've heard that's it's a 'turn-off' for some women if a man asks what kind of dates a woman prefers if they're dating . Like the whole 'planning stage' of a date . I usually ask the woman I've been talking to what kind of dates she prefers, the cuisine she likes and it's never been a problem for me personally but is that really a thing that women consider?

I usually go for lowkey first dates regardless and they're rarely expensive , not more than 20$ combined for both. And the women usually never have a problem . Also I've been in turn asked for  'walk in the park dates ' or coffee dates before as a first date and they've all been cost effective and great !

Also this is an incessant topic but I usually pay for the first dates but if she offers to i always accept to go dutch . What do you guys usually do ?

Also I know there are a variety of other date options out there , so what do you guys prefer ? 

And what are some absolute NO's in terms of first date ideas , like i would say I would never invite a woman 'home' for the first date because that sounds like a terrible idea. ",1,1742394379.0,PurplePillDebate,26,0.67,False

1jey4lw,https://www.reddit.com/r/drivinganxiety/comments/1jey4lw/i_finally_bought_a_car_and_have_been_driving/,I finally bought a car and have been driving consistently for 3 months — things that helped!,"So I got into a severe car crash 5 years ago that left me terrified of driving. When I got pregnant, I knew it was time to get a car and get back on the road so that me and baby aren’t stuck in the house. 

Something important to note: I already had my license and know how to drive. I had also been practicing in little bursts for months in parking lots and refamiliarizing myself with the rules. 

So these are really only going to help if you already know how to drive, but suffer from anxiety.

A few things that seriously helped me take the plunge:

- I bought a car I love and feel safe in. I was incredibly picky about it. It has lots of safety features that make me feel better, even though I find that I don’t tend to rely on them (which you never should). I test drove a LOT of cars and in that time was practicing in my husband’s and friend’s car.

- In the first month or so, I did not drive alone. My husband came everywhere with me, and he would talk me through everything. He slowly weaned me off instructions until I was simply asking when I wanted them. I still occasionally ask questions when he is with me. He’s a very good teacher.

- Very short drives, building up my tolerance for longer drives. I did not just start off with 30 minute drives. My first drives were simply to the grocery store and back (5 minutes each way), and I slowly expanded my radius. Confronting discomfort was important, but it had to be on my terms and when I felt ready.

- I drove EVERY DAY. No excuses. I had to find a reason to get out of the house because going a day without driving would make me backslide into more anxiety. This doesn’t really happen anymore, since I’ve taken so many drives that driving is starting to feel normal. 

- My first interstate drive was on my terms, and my husband talked me through the whole thing. 

- Cruise control. Staying up to speed on the interstate can be tricky for me since I struggle with anxiety on the interstate. I put cruise control on so that I don’t have to fuss with staying at speed. 

- No music with words. I listen to calming Nintendo music in the car. Everyone else just has to deal with it. If I drive, we listen to Nintendo music and talk lol. Loud  music with words seriously distracts me and amps up my anxiety. 

- HIGH REWARD DRIVES. I get treats when I successfully complete a drive. I get to go out to eat with a friend. I get coffee. I get to surprise my husband with something. When a drive, I get a reward. I don’t care if it’s childish — if I’m confronting my biggest fear, I get a treat! This helps me stay motivated to get out there and do the thing.

The anxiety isn’t gone. But in 3 months, I am now able to drive anywhere in my local area on my own. I am not yet ready to make 45 minute drives on my own, but that isn’t necessary in my day-to-day life. 

The nightmares have all but stopped, and I have found a new sense of independence I haven’t felt in years. 

The journey certainly isn’t over, but I never thought I’d drive again. So I’m very happy with where I am now!

No, not sewer gremlins. I mean fancy rats adorable, clever little creatures who will love you unconditionally (provided you offer them snacks).

I’ve had rats for many years, and let me tell you, they’re like tiny, low-maintenance dogs with less drama. They’ll nap in a hammock all day while you’re at work, then turn into acrobatic maniacs at night, trashing their cage like tiny rockstars. They learn their names, come when called, and get this some even play fetch. Meanwhile, your friend’s cat is still ignoring them after five years.

Something I'd like I knew before getting my first pet rat**:**

Get at least two (unless you want a lonely, depressed rat staring at you like you ruined its life).

Big cage, lots of toys, and a litter tray (yes, they can be potty trained).

Avoid eucalyptus cleaners rat lungs are delicate.

They hate cage cleaning. They will judge you for it.

Yes, they only live 2-3 years, which is the universe’s cruel joke, but trust me, those years will be full of ridiculous, heartwarming moments. So if you want a pet that’s affectionate, trainable, and won’t knock your coffee off the table just for fun then yea rats might just be for you.

Am I doing this diet wrong? Drinking too much water eating pasteurised butter and sauerkraut juice with my raw meat something just feels off and I can’t tell why 

Am I eating too much fat?

How do I get rid of this bacteria or virus should I fast to get starve it off or will that lead to electrolytes imbalances?

Is there any point in doing this diet since I have zero access to raw dairy products which are a beneficial part of this diet and will probably ruin my social life and bank account I am also still experiencing cystic skin issues that are healing slower than usual
I felt great at first eating this way now I’m having second thoughts 

The positives I was noticing for the past week were

better calmer mood/clarity 

Healthy weight gain and appetite 

Not feeling the meat sit on my stomach after eating 

Better sleep and circadian rhythms 

No more nicotine cravings after 2 weeks quitting 

Less caffeine cravings but not completely gone
I still have a cup of tea or coffee before I have a meal for the day as this helps me keep nicotine out of my mind 

I’m also finding water consumption very tricky with this way of eating i drink water in the mornings otherwise don’t really feel thirsty or get a dry mouth but then dehydration symptoms will hit me at a random point in the day 

Im at a loss of what to do any advice would be appreciated

Tried it a second time today and it still worked!! My mind's not all over the place and I could actually focus on my work. It's like 6 hours in and I still feel relatively calm (do I actually have anxiety or is it my ADHD?!)

I'm gonna drink it every time I need deep work, and I also wanna experiment with other energy drinks like RedBull lol also I was always a coffee drinker as I like the taste but it either had no effect or it made me sleepy. 

Is this what being on medication feels like?

Edit: thanks for the concern everybody, I'm not (and will never) be reliant on substances for daily functioning, I don't even drink soda or coffee daily!

I'm 6'3"" and probably need to lose 30lbs and I moan to myself about jeans being snug, jackets don't zip, shirts too tight. I know I need to lose weight but I just can't take that first step to do anything. 
I work retail, usually closing and I put in 10,000 steps there. Sometimes I'm working a full 14hr days and others less, my Dr tells me that it's good to get the steroid but they didn't count as exercise (cardio and such)
My morning routine is up at 7, two cups of coffee while watching TV or scrolling then shower and dressed by 9. 
In my imagination, I'd get up and do some kind of workout before coffee or after one cup, shower and second coffee. Reality is that I just want that coffee and then I settle back in with the second. 
I've seen others mention being self-conscious working out at home and I thought it was just me being a weirdo (glad to see it's not) but that is a big factor. 
I have a couple of dumbbells and a barbell sitting in my closet but I never know when or how to utilize them. Like, just in the middle of the day do I randomly wander in and start lifting? Should I say ""after I shower I'll do something for 15 minutes""? 
A lot of what I assume you're supposed to be doing comes from TV and movies, type A guys hitting the gym before work but, as much as I wish it was, that's not me

I asked him to settle the bill first and leave me the receipt, si ati siezi jilipia but yeye ndio ameniinvite and it's the last 500 bob I have on me. He went with the waiter and came back saying amesettle (without leaving the receipt) and to tell him when I'm leaving, which of course I won't coz he's blocked now. Oh, sijawaambia my biggest icks....coming up the stairs he held my hand then started heading for my bum, I shoved him off and he held me kwa shoulders.
