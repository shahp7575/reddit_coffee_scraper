I know it’s included with some Google One plans, but is it actually good? Does it slow down internet speed a lot? I mainly need a VPN for extra privacy when using public Wi-Fi at coffee shops and airports. I also travel sometimes, and I’d like to access some websites that are blocked in certain countries. I don’t do anything crazy online, but I just want to keep my data safe and avoid annoying restrictions. Has anyone here used Google One VPN recently? Is it worth it, or should I look for a different VPN? Would love to hear your experiences. Thanks!",1,1738253298.0,VPNFreaks,0,1.0,False

1idqam8,https://www.reddit.com/r/createthisworld/comments/1idqam8/consumables_13/,Consumables (1/3),"Comrade Director Mr. Henry Walker sat at a stable and considered getting drunk for a very brief moment. It wasn't completely out of the question-political meetings often involved boozy lunches-but he needed a sober head to deal with this. And maybe he'd be able to use getting drunk as presentation material...

Comrade People's Representative to the Korschan People's Parliament (PPKPP) Stauchvinka walked into the room. She was very slightly late, by 45 seconds according to the wall clock. C.D.Mr. Henry Walker didn't care. People have to walk places, after all. 

'Comrade! Good morning!' 

'Good morning, Comrade.' C.D.Mr. Walker was a bit more subduedd. Stauchvinka was always Energetically Revolutionary, and he was both older and had suffered more dashed dreams. She'd been able to make up for those losses by putting people in labor camps. 'I hope you liked breakfast?'

'A revolutionary does not need more than a morning glass of water to begin their day, Comrade Walker. Breakfast can bring one down.'

'Well, I am under a doctor's orders now to maintain my bone strength. So I must eat breakfast now.'

'Hrmmm.' His Gumrade sat down at the table, and Walker finished his food. 'Is this anything I should be concerned about?'

'No.' The older man would have smiled, but he had some food in his teeth and just wiped his mouth with a napkin. Manners weren't bourgeoisie. 'Plenty of other things...require concern, Comrade.'

Stauchvinka had a sense that the engine cowling was off. 'Please begin.'

Walker stretched, then took a sip from his coffee-simulating substance. 'I will talk about your past. It's been glorious, and then it was...successful. You overthrew the feudal order, you revolutionized and built up society, you achieved quite a lot of development. But it lacks revolutionary nature.' 

'I see.' The PPKPP crossed her paws. 'Why?' No comrade here.

'Everything-city rebuilding-housing rebuilding-water supply revolutionization-has been fine. You have been able to urbanize without pressuring the people to join cities, and you have naturally opened the local industrial factors that are employed in construction. You have done a thorough job with the development of agricultural support methods.'

'Thank you.'

'You have done them very quickly.' He raised the caffeine cup. 'And that has given you some breathing room. Some. But not enough.'

'Comrade...' Not very comrade-like. 'What are you getting at? Obfuscating rhetoric is reactionary.'

'You need to do more, and you need to do it for certain results.' There was a glint in his eyes and glasses. 'You need to achieve miracles.'

'And we are not?'

'No. But you can. You have already conceived of what can and must be done.'

'Comrade. *Focus*.'

'Minni, Comrade. Minni. You need to arrive making Minni. You have just started the train trip.'

'Just Minni? I-'

'Oh, my fumb.' Walker meant 'my bad'. 'I'm using minni as an example, since it is talked about a lot. But there is a lot more that you must pursue.'

'...and?' The PPKKPP looked annoyed. 'Concrete goals. *Please.*' 

'Your city is meeting them, Comrade. When I first toured the city, I saw the high performance of it's granaries and textile mills and paper making plants. And last week, I picked up pants made in a new clothing factory, was given pamphlets from a printing shop, and then got fresh bread from an industrial bakery. For all of this, I paid little, showing the superiority of a rationally-based economy.' 

'What's your criticism, then?'

'You have developed agriculture to the highest level you can at the moment. You have improved the logistics of the field somewhat. You have demonstrated the ability to transform raw materials, starting with refining-flour, thread, cloth, and paper. But the planners here are only seeing those as component materials instead of things that need further refining and development. They are too fixated on their immediate uses. They-'

'Have you starved, Comrade?'

'Yes.'

'Then why do you criticize when an entire society suffers hunger from birth?'

C.D. Mr. Walker sighed. 'Because you're only looking forward. You're not looking up. You're just looking ahead, you're not looking to escape. You should have so much more than you do right now. If you look up, like I do, then you will see what Tiboria does. I see so much potential in Korscha, and I also
see it wasted every single day. I want you to look up.'

Stauvchinka sighed. 'Comrade...' beforehand, she'd wanted to clock him one. But he'd showed that he actually cared. 'Let me show you something.' The PPKPP quickly washed down some tea, then moved a finger around her lips as she opened her mouth. Numerous teeth were missing. 

'Did you lose those in the revolution?'

""No. I lost them to scurvy.""

Walker steepled his fingers and looked down. ""Now I understand."" 

There was a moment of silence. Stauvchinka rubbed her neck. ""Twice I was forced to wear a yoke for looking up. Five times a sackcloth hood. I will lift my heirs' heads to the sky that I can't see.""

""There is still time."" The words burst out of Walker unbidden. ""There is still time, Comrade. Listen-if it is weakness of your body-""

""If you are talking about the worms, then yes, those are also a problem.""

""I mean the mal-nutrition."" C.D.Mr. Walker had thought about that, but not as much. ""So far, Comrade, you have made excellent progress in preventing it. Korscha is no longer isolated by geography, it has much more land to work with, the quality of farming has been improved in such a short time that four centuries of advancements have been marked in twenty years by cooperation alone. Cooperation alone, Stauvchinka-no capital! That is theoretically impossible. We're revising the textbooks for that.""

""The revolution also takes place within us.""

""That it does. You have revolutionized revolutionary theory."" 

""We have. However, it is practice that revolutionizes it. And you need to focus on practice.""

""I have been. You need to practice better chemistry. You have revolutionized the material factors of refining and the first and second stages of processing. Now you must establish the third stage of processing, and visualize the fourth stage in order to continue the material revolution.""

""We have some plans for what the third stage of processing may include.""

""I hope that they are rigorous.""

""...they have wiggle room. Very simply, we intend to produce bandages, cardboard, and food supplements. These will enhance life through their individual effects.
Food supplements will make food more nutritious. Bandages are necessary for the intended medical rollout. And cardboard is a useful packaging material. It is a
priority for the logistics development goals in the 45th edition of the Five Year Plan.""

""So you are looking forward. Not up."" 

""We are looking forward, and then forward again. The next target is medicine, and advanced chemistry will take us there.""

C.D.Mr. Walker sighed. ""Not great. Not terrible.""

""Thank you, Comrade.""

""But you need more. You need to create miracles and monsters. You need to look up.""

The PPKPP donned a smile. ""Tell me more.""

""You need an example project. Something to show people the benefits of power-you and I know that power speaks for itself, and justifies it's own creation and expansion-but many people haven't. They need to see results.""

""What's first?""

C.D.Mr. Walker smiled. ""It's time to write to Nautilus.""",1,1738253076.0,createthisworld,0,1.0,False

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG Solid advice for new plasma donors included! Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

Our doctor told us yesterday that my 18m boy may be high functioning autistic. It’s been in the back of my mind since he was about 4 months old… he will be referred for testing and diagnosis and is being referred currently for speech and occupational therapy. 

I guess I’d like to see if anyone has a little with diagnosis and experienced any of the things we are seeing… 

-Delayed everything… didn’t smile or laugh for a while, didn’t crawl till after he turned 1, just started walking at around 16 months. Doesn’t say anything, no words at all though he is super vocal with noises and sounds. Doesn’t point, or wave or really use any hand gestures. 
-plays different… if it spins he’s spinning it. He doesn’t play with toys the way they’re intended, mostly he just throws them around or lines them up or his biggest one is putting random items in a pile. He hates teddy bears but LOVES books. 
-sensory… would never let us swaddle him, he had to have his arms out and still won’t let us cover his arms for sleep. Bed humping I guess? Idk how to explain this one other than he will “hump” the bed or couch, floor or even do it on us when he’s tired or asleep. He does circles around the coffee table ALL DAY over and over again. When he’s tired or being put to sleep he touches all over our faces. Will grab our ears, nose and mouth while he’s falling asleep. He used to twirl his foot when he was relaxing or drinking his bottle, it shows back up every once in a while still. If a machine hums like a washer/dryer/dishwasher he likes to put his ear and face up to it. Ofc he also does hand/arm flapping when he’s mad or excited. 

He will not use a spoon or fork, and he does not like to eat his food off of a plate or bowl. He will dump it out or pick each piece off and put it directly on the table. 

He does…. Make eye contact, respond to his name. Show emotion and smiles back. But he does not kiss, or hug. He’s also not into others socially aside from our immediate family. He is smart, sometimes too smart lol

1idq34x,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeatherCoxRichardson/comments/1idq34x/january_29_2025/,"January 29, 2025","In a conversation with Greg Sargent of the *New Republic* published today, writer Amanda Marcotte called out an important moment in White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt’s first press conference yesterday.

When a reporter noted that “\[e\]gg prices have skyrocketed since President Trump took office,” and asked “what specifically is he doing to lower those costs for Americans?” Leavitt answered: “Really glad you brought this up because there is a lot of reporting out there that is putting the onus on this White House for the increased cost of eggs. I would like to point out to each and every one of you that in 2024, when Joe Biden was in the Oval Office or upstairs in the residence sleeping, I’m not so sure, egg prices increased 65 percent in this country. We also have seen the cost of everything—not just eggs—bacon, groceries, gasoline, have increased because of the inflationary policies of the last administration.”

During his campaign for the presidency, Trump repeatedly attacked Biden for the post-pandemic inflation that afflicted the country, and promised to bring down “the price of everything.” Even before he took office, Trump had begun to walk back his promise, and J.D. Vance has also suggested price relief would “take a little bit of time.” Now coffee and egg prices are at an all-time high, and the administration’s solution is to attack Biden. No matter the incompetencies of the Trump presidency, Marcotte notes, it appears the answer will be: You might not like what we’re doing, but don’t you hate Democrats more?

President Richard Nixon’s team pioneered this strategy before the 1970 midterm elections to rally wavering Republicans around the president’s party. Nixon had won election with a promise that he would end the war in Vietnam honorably, but had, in fact, increased the U.S. presence there. By the end of 1969, with opposition mounting, he insisted that a “silent majority” agreed with his Vietnam policies. Then, at the end of April 1970, he told the American people that he had sent ground troops into Vietnam’s neighbor Cambodia. Protests led to the killing of four college students at Ohio’s Kent State University. Members of Nixon’s key demographic, middle-class white Americans, threatened to abandon him.

Nixon’s advisors urged him to win his voters back by attacking their opponents as lazy, dangerous, and un-American. They called their strategy “positive polarization” because it stoked the anger they needed voters to feel in order to show up to vote, a development they saw as positive. Patrick Buchanan wrote a memo to Nixon urging him to take much stronger control over the nation, to manipulate the media, and to go to war with his opponents, whom he considered illegitimate, warning: “\[W\]e are in a contest over the soul of the country now and the decision will not be some middle compromise—it will be their kind of society or ours.”

Nixon so internalized this advice that by 1972 he was willing to sabotage his Democratic opponent’s campaign in order to win, convinced that a Democratic victory would destroy America. He ended up having to resign when his participation in covering up the bugging of the Democratic National Convention’s headquarters at the Watergate Hotel surfaced, but in his 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan picked up the rhetorical technique of dividing the country in two.

In part, that depended on constructing a false world, claiming when challenged on his stories of government mismanagement that a “liberal media” was determined to undermine him. When voters elected him, Reagan began the dismantling of the post–World War II government that protected equality before the law, equal access to resources, and the right to have a say in government. Whenever it seemed that voters were turning against the Republicans’ policies, which moved $50 trillion from the bottom 90% to the top 1% between 1981 and 2021, Republicans doubled down on the idea that popular government programs were “socialist” or “Marxist,” designed to redistribute wealth from hardworking Americans to undeserving “liberals.”

By 2020, accompanying that rhetoric with voter suppression and a flood of money into Republican election war chests had made many Republican voters loyal to the party above the country. So convinced were they that the government was corrupt and that they were fighting a war for America that they were willing to die of Covid in order to “own the Libs.” And in 2021 they tried to overturn democracy in order to keep their leader in power.

Now, in 2025, the impulse simply to hurt Democrats no matter how badly such actions would hurt the country showed in a social media post today by Senator Tommy Tuberville (R-AL) that the Senate should confirm Trump’s deeply problematic nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. because “no Cabinet nominee could damage the political future of Democrats more than RFK.”

Kennedy is before the Senate Finance Committee today in confirmation hearings to head the Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and the Food and Drug Administration, among other agencies. Kennedy is a conspiracy theorist who opposes the vaccines that have slashed deadly illnesses in the U.S., and has attacked the institutions he would oversee; more than 18,000 physicians have signed a letter opposing his confirmation.

Yesterday, Kennedy’s cousin, Caroline Kennedy, broke her silence about him to write an open letter to senators. She warned that he “lacks any relevant government, financial, management, or medical experience” and, calling him a “predator,” warned that he has “gone on to misrepresent, lie and cheat his way through life.”

Forcing the Republican agenda by continuing to portray political opponents as dangerous to America because of wasteful spending and misguided priorities has reached cartoonish extremes. Trump has nonsensically claimed that thanks to him, the U.S. military has “TURNED ON THE WATER” in California, apparently misunderstanding that the Army Corps of Engineers had conducted maintenance on federal water pumps for three days and turned them back on when the maintenance was complete.

Yesterday, Leavitt claimed that the Trump administration tried to stop all foreign aid because Biden supposedly sent $50 million of condoms to Gaza and that the administration was just focusing on being “good stewards of tax dollars.” The story is simply false. The U.S. Agency for International Development spent about $7 million on condoms in 2023, the vast majority of which went to Africa through anti-AIDS programs; Trump’s first administration made similar investments.

At the same time they are portraying Democrats as wasteful and misguided, Trump and MAGA Republicans are claiming Democratic accomplishments for themselves. Last night, Trump claimed he had “just asked Elon Musk and \[SpaceX\] to ‘go get’ the 2 brave astronauts who have been virtually abandoned in space by the Biden Administration,” and Musk chipped in that it was “\[t\]errible that the Biden administration left them there so long.” In fact, as fact-checkers quickly noted, NASA says the astronauts whose damaged spaceship has returned to Earth are not stuck in space but are staffing the space station, and that a SpaceX capsule has been docked at the station since September in an arrangement made by the Biden administration to bring them back to Earth as soon as a new crew arrives.

True MAGA is buying the lies the administration is selling—Fox News Channel pundit Jesse Watters suggested Gazans were using condoms as balloons to float explosives into Israel—but it is possible Nixon’s system of polarization is reaching the end of its rope.

Key to Trump’s 2024 win was his insistence that violent crime was skyrocketing in the U.S.—in fact, it was plummeting—and he vowed to deport “criminal” migrants. Since he took office, a number of made-for-television sweeps have tried to demonstrate that he is making America safer. But his commutations and pardons of all the January 6 rioters convicted of crimes has made that a hard sell, especially as one is now wanted for soliciting sex with a minor and another has been killed by Indiana police for resisting arrest. In addition, Aaron Reichlin-Melnick of the American Immigration Council notes that Trump officials ordered prosecutors to divert resources away from truly dangerous drug traffickers to go after undocumented immigrants.

Those who believed Trump would not come for anyone but “criminals” are learning otherwise: NBC News reported on Monday that nearly half the migrants arrested in a Chicago sweep on Sunday either had nonviolent offenses or had committed no offense. While the Trump administration defends its sweeps by saying it considers anyone who has broken immigration law to be a criminal, being undocumented is in fact a civil offense, not a crime, and many of Trump’s supporters did not think he would make such general sweeps.

But the biggest wake-up call for those embracing the longtime language of polarization is that when Trump on Tuesday shut down all federal funding and grants to stop what he called the “Marxist” diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives of the government, he was attacking virtually all Americans. The administration’s pause of all federal funding and grants until it could make sure “DEI” had been purged out of them cut everything from Meals on Wheels, a food delivery program for shut-ins, to education, local law enforcement, and the Medicaid on which programs for the elderly depend.

The outcry was so strong that today the Office of Management and Budget issued a memo to rescind its previous memo freezing all federal programs. But Leavitt immediately contradicted the apparent content of the new memo, saying the cuts were still in effect. Judd Legum of *Popular Information* noted that the plan seemed to be “to create as much chaos as possible.” That chaos keeps attention on the administration, and it appeared to be a way for the White House to upend lawsuits against the freeze. So far, that has not worked. U.S. District Judge John McConnell said he was inclined to grant a restraining order, noting that “the administration is acting with a distinction without a difference.”

The Trump administration’s cutting of the federal funding on which Americans depend in the name of opposition to “Marxism” and “DEI” contrasts spectacularly with its embrace of the world’s richest man, Elon Musk; the billionaires in Trump’s Cabinet; and the billionaires who have poured money into the Trump administration.

CNN’s Chris Isidore notes that government subsidies built Musk’s fortune and that he continues to receive government contracts worth billions of dollars. In addition to government contracts, Trump’s tax policy favors the very rich. On Monday, January 27, the Senate confirmed Trump’s nominee billionaire Scott Bessent for Treasury secretary. In his confirmation hearings, Bessent told the Senate that he believes extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts is “the single most important economic issue of the day…. If we do not fix these tax cuts, if we do not renew and extend, then we will be facing an economic calamity.”

Republicans identify the rapidly growing federal deficit as a crisis for which Democrats are to blame, but in fact, President Bill Clinton—with an assist from Republican president George H.W. Bush—eliminated the federal deficit in the 1990s. What threw the deficit into the red was the tax cuts and unfunded wars under George W. Bush, along with Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, or TCJA, that disproportionately benefited the very wealthy and corporations. The U.S. Treasury estimates that extending the TCJA as is—Trump has mused on deeper cuts—would cost $4.2 trillion over the next ten years.

Slashing the federal funding that supports ordinary Americans will make it easier to fund federal contracts and further tax cuts for the wealthy. With that tradeoff so visible in 2025, will “owning the Libs” still be worth it?

Trump seemed to be worried that it might not be. This afternoon he threw red meat directly at the MAGA base with an announcement that he would be signing an executive order to open a 30,000-person-capacity migrant detention center at Guantanamo Bay to “detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people.”

I didn’t really go through everything, I just really wanted to see if she had anyone on her messenger app because we’re not very active on social media. I saw she had recent searches for a lot of people but two guys stood out. One was some guy that she explained her friend asked her to look up which is whatever, and another is her best friends brother apparently. I simply asked “Why’s he on there?” And she said “Because I talk to him?”. A little odd but I was already late to drop off our kids at school, so I left. When I came back, I started my coffee and she said “Are we not going to talk about this?” And the argument began. 

She said she used to talk to him to keep up to date with her old best friend because she wouldn’t respond to my wife because her friend is also not very active on social media (she didn’t even post about her marriage or pregnancy). So my wife said she reached out to him to get updates on her life. She then said she felt “weird” for having him on there and “so I took him off”. I then asked “Did you also delete the messages?” And she said yes. There were recent messages that weren’t deleted, however, HE was the one that reached out. And the conversation wasn’t even about her old friend so I was confused. Those messages also just so happened to be around a time when we were taking a break (only a week long) for religious dispute reasons. So I’m still trying to get a more clear answer out of her but at this point she’s getting very defensive and says she feels like I’m accusing her even though all I’m doing is reiterating what she’s saying and adding “that doesn’t make sense to me”. She then showed that she blocked him recently (when our break ended and we fixed things). She said she blocked him because she realized “I’m not talking to my old best friends brother, I’m talking to a married man and it feels weird”. 

I promised I wouldn’t walk away from arguments but she just kept getting defensive and saying I’m accusing her so I said “Look, you need to go to work and I’m heading to the gym.” I got ready and left.",1,1738252502.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False

I reached obesity class 3 so, in December, I decided to try to regain a healthy weight. With that, I noticed that my right foot had swollen and only would go back to normal if I spent hours lying down (both foot would always get swollen during the summer and I just had to move them a little, even when sitting, for them to go back to normal).

So I went to the doctor in January to check on it, no liquid retention, complete hemogram showing all good, etc. The only blood test they didn't do was for glycated hemoglobin. I have an appointment with another doctor for February to check on my right foot (check on my lymphatic system).

Because some members of my family have diabetes while others have hypoglycemia, I went bought and did a capillary test while fasting. It showed 125 and 124 the next day.

So I changed my diet, but not completely because I already didn't eat much that would cause problems (my only sugar intake was in my coffee and I drink a lot of coffee daily), most of the changes was eating things that I wasn't eating, like vegetables and fruits.

Last week I did another test, it was 97 and today it was 94 (I was checking because people asked me if I could eat calabrese sausage).

Is it reducing that fast normal and can I make exceptions to what I eat? I still gonna bring all this up with my doctor next month.",1,1738252355.0,prediabetes,1,1.0,False

I called some of my other college girlfriends so that it wouldn’t be too much of a sausage fest lol. The guy my friend was talking to was around our age, but the guys he brought along with him were 10 years older than us. They were already established lawyers, while me and my girlfriends were in 3rd year college. 

I formed a micro crush on one of the guys. He was quiet and mysterious, but in a dorky way. But I was too shy and intimidated to strike up a substantial conversation with him. The guys were fun to party with and not creepy at all, but the 10 year age gap was still there. At the end of the night, the guy I had a crush on offered to drive home two of my girlfriends. He showed them his driver’s license so that they could take a picture of it to send to someone they trusted so that they would feel more at ease getting a ride from him. 

When I heard about that gesture, I grew more fond of him. We exchanged Instagrams, but I never reached out. At the time, he was also a part-time prof in another university, so I didn’t think he’d be interested in someone as old as his students. 

The crush died down because I knew nothing would ever come out of it, but I would smile the teeniest tiniest bit inside every time I saw him in my story views or saw a post of his on my feed that radiated tito vibes (i.e., he puts periods in his Instagram captions). Through the years, I dated other guys and he got pushed out of my consciousness. 

Fast forward to present-day, I graduated from college a few weeks ago. I was also in a dating dry spell. I saw an Instagram story of his (nothing fancy, just a restory of a workout class he joined), and my fondness for him came back. I realized I had already finished college and had matured a lot since we first met, so it would be less weird to hit him up. Also, there’s just something about the month of January as the month of new beginnings and go-getting that fueled my brazenness. So I DMed him on Instagram. I told him that he’d always stood out to me ever since we met because he was cute and he drove my friends home, so I wanted to ask him out. 

This was my first time asking someone ten years older than me out–let alone asking ANYONE out, so I was nervous, of course. But he said yes! It was the first time anyone had asked him out, so he was impressed by the confidence. The conversation accelerated so organically. We quickly overcame the tiptoe-y niceties and began bantering. He said I was younger than his inaanak (one year older than me), to which I responded that he was born before my parents even met. 

We met for lunch and got coffee after. The banter was as fun in person as online. We laughed a lot. But despite the banter, he was still the perfect gentleman and it was all so pleasantly natural. He covered the sidewalk rule, opening all doors (including car doors), and he paid for the meal. After the date, we continued talking. He’s a really busy lawyer, but we found ourselves talking at least for an hour a day–part banter, part mundane updates. 

I thought all was going well, but three days after the date, I asked about his weekend plans and if he was going to ask me out this time and then he broke it to me that he didn’t want to continue seeing me because we’re at different points in our lives. He wanted to keep himself open for someone with the same timeline. I am going to medical school in August, and he wants to get married within the next 2-5 years. I was disappointed because the chemistry was undeniably there, but I understood him. He wasn’t getting any younger, and he was exercising foresight. 

While we will not be seeing each other anymore, I am still so happy I asked him out. I felt empowered. I also discovered more about the relationship dynamic I’m looking for. So I hope this post encourages anyone reading this, especially my fellow women, to JUST DO IT! Go pave the path toward what/who you want. Most things in life, you can get if you just ask. And even if you don’t get exactly what you wanted, you usually get something else that you didn’t know you needed. :)",1,1738252276.0,CasualPH,2,0.67,False

Understanding Teeth Whitening: The Basics

Teeth whitening is more than just a cosmetic procedure - it's a science-backed method to restore your smile's natural brightness. Professional teeth whitening centers use advanced techniques that are far more effective than over-the-counter products. These specialized treatments can:

- Remove deep-set stains
- Provide uniform whitening

The Science Behind Professional Teeth Whitening

Professional teeth whitening leverages powerful bleaching agents that penetrate tooth enamel more effectively than home treatments. Typically, these treatments use hydrogen peroxide or carbamide peroxide, which break down stain-causing molecules. The concentration and application method are crucial - something only trained professionals can optimize.

Types of Professional Teeth Whitening Treatments

In-Office Whitening
In-office treatments offer the most dramatic results, often lightening teeth by several shades in a single session. The procedure typically takes 60-90 minutes and provides immediate, noticeable improvements.

Take-Home Professional Whitening Kits
For those preferring gradual whitening, professional take-home kits offer a convenient alternative. These custom-fitted trays ensure even application and consistent results.

Choosing the Right San Diego Teeth Whitening Center

When selecting a teeth whitening center, consider these critical factors:

- Reputation and reviews
- Professional credentials
- Technology and equipment
- Treatment options
- Patient testimonials
- Consultation process

Cost Considerations and Insurance

Professional teeth whitening is typically considered a cosmetic procedure and isn't covered by standard dental insurance. Prices in San Diego can range from $300 to $1,000 depending on the treatment complexity and desired results.

Potential Side Effects and Safety

While professional teeth whitening is generally safe, some patients might experience:
- Temporary tooth sensitivity
- Mild gum irritation
- Uneven whitening

A reputable San Diego teeth whitening center will conduct a thorough examination to minimize these risks.

She’s always been a coffee lover—never starts her day without a cup. But over the last few years, she’s struggled with her weight, especially after hitting her mid-50s. She tried different diets, cut back on sugar, and even started walking more, but nothing seemed to make a big difference.

Back in early November 2023, a friend told her about FitSpresso, a coffee blend designed to help with metabolism and weight loss. At first, she laughed it off, thinking, ""Great, another ‘miracle’ coffee."" But since she was drinking coffee every day anyway, she figured, Why not swap it out and see what happens?

[FitSpresso](https://preview.redd.it/fg2mqpmxi5ge1.png?width=474&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f8bcc7c56d2c7e1c8623076617069bb2a55a50e)

**Weeks 1-2: The Taste Test & First Impressions**

The first thing she told me was that it actually tastes like real coffee, which was a relief. She was expecting something weird or bitter, but it was smooth and easy to drink. She replaced her usual morning cup with FitSpresso and kept everything else in her routine the same.

After about two weeks, she started noticing subtle changes—mainly in her appetite. She used to get really bad afternoon cravings, but suddenly, she wasn’t reaching for snacks as often. She also said she had more consistent energy throughout the day, instead of the usual mid-afternoon slump.

**Weeks 3-6: The Surprising Changes**

By the time she hit the one-month mark, she had dropped four pounds without making any big lifestyle changes. She wasn’t following a strict diet, just eating normally, but she felt less bloated and noticed her clothes fit a little better. More importantly, she said she felt lighter and more energized, which motivated her to be a little more active.

Now, after six weeks, she’s lost about seven pounds total, and she’s actually enjoying the process. She didn’t expect FitSpresso to be a magic bullet, but she thinks it’s been a simple, effective way to support her weight loss without feeling deprived.

**Final Thoughts – Worth Trying?**

Would I say FitSpresso is a life-changing weight loss solution? Probably not. But for someone like my aunt, who already drinks coffee daily, it’s been an easy, no-effort change that’s actually helped her control cravings, boost energy, and support her weight loss goals.

If you’re a coffee drinker looking for a small tweak to your routine, it might be worth trying. Has anyone else experimented with FitSpresso or other metabolism-boosting coffees? Would love to hear your experiences!

1idpqw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/thyroidhealth/comments/1idpqw9/hyperthyroidism_celiac_pcos_and_bed/,"Hyperthyroidism, celiac, PCOS, and BED","Content warning: eating disorder

Has anyone else here experienced hyperthyroidism, celiac disease, PCOS, AND binge eating disorder (BED)? This is kind of half-rant, half looking for other people who’ve dealt with the intersection of hyper/Graves and a bunch of other autoimmune issues, especially if you’ve figured out strategies for managing it all. I’m in the midst of them right now, and at times I feel like I’m kind of losing my mind.

I’ve struggled with BED on and off since I was fourteen (I’m in my late twenties now) and I was doing pretty well with it until 2024, when I started having more regular binges again. I was diagnosed with celiac in May, and since restriction is typically a trigger for me, I started binge eating more frequently after switching to a totally gluten free diet. (I figured that if I can’t eat gluten, I can at least treat myself to all the gluten free goodies that I want.) Fast forward to November, and I get diagnosed with PCOS. My gynecologist tells me to cut out \*all added sugars\* and most carbs. (I cry.) I replace almost all of the added sugars I’ve been consuming with fruits and switch to less-processed carbs. Some of my PCOS issues improve (I’m seeing a reduction in acne, less painful menstruation, and my testosterone levels start to go down), but other issues remain or worsen (I’m still having significant hair loss, my heart is racing, and I’m having pretty intense tremors in my hands). I also notice that my appetite is THROUGH THE ROOF, and I start tracking calories again (something I haven’t done in years because it usually triggers binge eating) and discover that I’m eating up to 3,500 calories a day, even though I’ve been losing weight over the past several months. So, my doc checks my TSH, and it comes back as <0.005. Hyperthyroidism it is.

My doctor starts me on 5mg methimazole 3x/day. I start taking it and notice a mild reduction in tremors and some days where my appetite is a bit muted. I figure that the medication is doing its job, and I might just need to switch to a higher dose eventually. (I’m still waiting to get my T3 and T4 levels checked because of health insurance obstacles.) Then, almost exactly at week four of the methimazole, it’s like a switch gets flipped. Suddenly, I feel full. My ravenous hunger has vanished, and instead of feeling shaky and lightheaded an hour after eating, I feel… satisfied. I’m sleeping through the night—no more waking up feeling hot and sweaty and jittery. My tremors are almost completely gone (they only seem to emerge after an intense workout or a big cup of coffee.) And, the biggest change of all (one that I didn’t even expect) is that I FEEL CALM. I’ve been anxious for pretty much my whole life, but I always figured that this feeling of being on-edge was due to all the stressful things that were happening. (Of course I’m anxious; I’m managing a whole pile of chronic illnesses in addition to regular life stressors! Who wouldn’t be anxious under those circumstances?) But, nope—apparently, when my thyroid isn’t pumping a gazillion gallons of hormones into my system 24/7, I don’t feel like a live wire all the time. I had no idea that so much of my social anxiety and perpetual agitation was related to my hormones, not just \*who I am as a person.\* It almost feels like a spiritual experience to suddenly have this clarity.

I get to experience this new, blissfully calm way of walking through the world for almost a week. Then, disaster strikes. I go out to eat at a restaurant that \*supposedly\* serves celiac-safe meals, but evidently, they do not. I get glutened. I have belly cramps, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and joint pain. I figure, “Well, this sucks, but at least I’ll be feeling back to normal in the next few days or weeks.” But then, I notice something more significant is happening; my methimazole seems to have stopped working. I’m having night sweats and waking up feeling too hot. My hands are shaking again, so badly that I’m having trouble writing. My hunger is once again through the roof, and I’m eating until my jaw muscles hurt, but my body still feels like I’m starving. Worst of all, the calmness that I experienced when the methimazole really took effect has evaporated. I’m back to my anxiety-ridden state, and it almost feels worse now that I know there’s a way of \*not\* feeling this agitated. After some Googling, my hunch as to what happened is that the inflammation in my gut caused by the recent gluten exposure reduced my ability to absorb the medication, so I’m just not getting adequate doses of the methimazole anymore. I have an appointment coming up with my PCP soon, and I’m going to float this theory by her, but it’s my best guess as of yet. I have no idea how long this will last, and it feels awful, like I’m stuck back at square one while I wait for my gut to heal.

So, in the meantime, I’m back to feeling agitated and dealing with all the other hyperthyroidism symptoms, my gut feels \*terrible\* from the combination of being glutened and being absolutely packed with all the food that I’m eating, and I feel so frustrated with myself for binge eating even though I can’t tell how much of this is actually BED-related, or if it’s my body’s increased need for food due to hyperthyroidism.

If any of y’all have been through anything similar, I’d be so grateful to hear what helped you out. (Or just to know that someone else has been through this, too.) I’m fortunate to have a lot of supportive people in my life, but most of them haven’t been through anything quite like this, so sometimes I just feel like a total oddity, and it’s easy to go down a mental spiral of feeling impossibly alone and broken.

1idppx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1idppx2/i_dreamt_that_i_went_back_in_time_to_prevent_my/,I dreamt that I went back in time to prevent my ex from killing herself.,"(This is a long one sorry!)

In my dream, I was living in the future and time travelling became a thing, so I went back in time to find my ex, Anne, and stop her from killing herself. I told her how much I miss her and how much I regret not telling her how important she was. I showed her photos of her nephew and niece and told her how well they were doing, I had my phone with me somehow. She believed me, obviously recognising me looking older than I would have been at that time, and I went back to my present.. Then I realised that it didn’t change the outcome, and I basically broke the space time continuum because of my actions. So I travelled back through time again to stop myself from going into the past, but I couldn’t interact with myself.. I was trying to figure this out when I woke up.

I’ve known her since we were 7 (around 1998), and we were good friends for a time but she moved away and we lost contact. Then we randomly met again at school when we were 16 (around 2007) and we recognised each other instantly. Not long after we started dating each other. She was my first girlfriend and I was so in love, the relationship was very intense. Eventually, I learned why she moved away: her younger brother got hit by a train and died in front of her mum.. Not long after, her mother committed suicide because she couldn’t live without her son… Leaving her daughter, elder son, elder daughter and husband behind. It destroyed the family, and subsequently she had a terrible childhood, with abuse and possibly rape (I never asked for more information as this was clearly deeply traumatising and talking about it was really hard for her), she had so many scars on her body from self mutilation... After 3 years of being together on and off, we broke it off as we couldn’t make it work. Too many issues on both parts (I had problems going on too with my mum dying of cancer and father abuse). 

We remained good friends for a long time, seeing each other for coffee every now and then, but in 2013 I moved away to another country with my girlfriend at the time. I kept in touch with Anne, but over the years my girlfriend got really jealous of girls who would talk to me, because of her own insecurity, so over time I stopped talking to Anne and other people in my life, including my friends and parents (I am thankfully not with this girlfriend anymore, she was extremely toxic and basically wanted to keep me all to herself, I was in love and thought it was the right thing). 

One day Anne sent me an email asking if I wanted to come to her wedding, she had met someone and was really happy. I was so happy for her but told her I couldn’t come, I gave a bullshit excuse because I didn’t want to tell her I will not come because my girlfriend would be too jealous. She replied saying she understood and hoped I was happy and wished me well. Then 2 years later in 2017, my mum calls me out of the blue and asked if I heard the news.. I had no idea what she was talking about, she then told me she heard through Anne’s sister that Anne killer herself jumping in front of a train (the fucking irony) and forwarded me her suicide letter. In the letter, Anne apologised to everyone, basically saying she just couldn’t keep on living pretending to be happy. She was so deeply damaged by her past she just couldn’t keep on living.. I broke down crying and felt so horrible, I had lost someone who was so important in my life. When my ex came home she asked me what happened so I told her, and she just shrugged and said “well she’s fucking stupid for killing herself” and went on with her evening (that’s the moment I realised I didn’t want to be with her anymore ffs).

Anne was a beautiful and gentle soul, she was so funny, clever and kind, we had many things in common and she showed me so many cool metal bands that I still listen to, she was so selfless and always happy to help anyone who needed it. She was always there for her family and had so much love to give. I regret so much not being able to talk to her one last time, try anything to stop her.. Apologise for not being there for her wedding, explain why I didn’t come.. Sadly, I do think she had her mind set, I doubt anything or anyone could have changed it, but I would have liked to try. I miss you so much Anne, I’m sorry I couldn’t be there when you asked, I think about you very often and will not let your memory die. I just feel so stupid for not doing something, I thought that she was happy and had found a way to deal with her trauma.. Now I have to live with this guilt. In the great scheme of things, I’m not even entirely sure I made a difference to her life, but she did to mine and I don’t know how to live with it. Don’t wait to tell people you love them.

TL, DR: my ex killed herself because of deep trauma, I miss her a lot, and I feel guilty I didn’t have a moment to talk to her one last time.

1idpp9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheAmazingRace/comments/1idpp9b/s4e11_homophobia/,S4E11 ... homophobia,"I just paused on the recap of the last episode and it looks like there was a Toy Story Coffee place somewhere in Seoul back in 2003. There's artwork of Mr. and Mrs. Potato Head on the sign. Was it fully licensed by Disney? Somehow I doubt it.

Incredibly, three of the four remaining teams had not used their fast forward by this episode (guess they don't count for all that much). 

Kelly said the pressure of being the only girl left in the race was starting to get to her. I really wonder what she meant by that... She followed it up by saying the challenges were hard on her. Again, I don't think that's to do with her being a woman necessarily, but just with her lack of physicality (which I guess some would say it's unfeminine to have physical strength, not me). IDK, gender roles twenty years ago. It says something.

What also strikes me about this program being two decades old is the homophobia (or at least the jokes at the expense of Chip and Dale's sexuality). The literal title of this episode (the weirdly mangled: ""Such a Nice Pheromone Smell to You; Just Makes Me Want to Stay Close to You"") is Jon sidling up to Chip and Reichen, trying to get exactly the same tickets as them for as little work as possible, and then making a bizarre joke that is a pass at their sexuality. One of the gays attests that ""Jon tries to make us as stereotypically gay as he wants us to be, but it bothers him that we're more masculine and manly than he is"". I can only imagine there are more shenanigans behind the scenes, but big yikes Jon! I think it's been wonderful that each season of the show I have seen has had gay representation, and until now, we really haven't seen any sort of discrimination against the gays on this show (I mean, everyone hated the Guidos but there were never remarks about their sexuality). It's uncomfortable, but important that it's documented that people felt open enough to discriminate against gay people on national TV twenty years ago. It looks like we might be returning to those times, sadly.

This airport drama was the most upsetting to me because, through a cruel twist of fate, Jon and Al got left behind when the other teams flew ahead, to a course set without any equalisers. These two have really met every challenge head-on. They've been decisive, worked together well, helped other teams, smiled the whole way, smart, and very physically active to complete the physical challenges quickly. I mean they're pretty much the perfect team. This leg they simply got unlucky and I was gutted when I realised they really had no hope.

Teams burst from Brisbane airport and the first ones away were David and Jeff, and I guess yeah, if it's the last time you're allowed to use the fast forward, why not do it now? It's interesting that both the twats and the clowns inuited that D+J were going to do the fast forward. It was fun to see the goats splash around in the water and fail miserably at putting the swimmer onto the surfboard, dropping her in the ocean several times.

Meanwhile, the other teams were doing Face First or Foot First (they always have corny names, these detours, and that's why I love them... I think my favourite is still Extreme Swiss vs Very Swiss). Naturally, all teams chose Face First, because there really wasn't a second to lose... although they all could have beat the clowns by a long way...

More ribbing from Jon ensued, but it did seem to stem from his insecurity about being beaten by a couple of gay men. I wonder if Jon has ever spoken about this since, and clarified if he is really homophobic or not. Kelly had a laughably bad descent: a lot of schadenfreude seeing the ""villains"" suffer. I would absolutely love to do face first rappelling.

Next, a 70-minute drive to Mooloolaba and UnderWater World. After seeing racers in some of the most amazing places on earth, it was rather funny to see them visit a cheesy-looking aquarium. The roadblock required a team member talk walk through the big tank amongst sharks to retrieve treasure. I know the sharks are supposed to be scary, but this was honestly one of the daftest looking challenges I've ever seen. Weirdly enough a video went viral in the last 24 hours showing a ['mermaid' performer getting bitten by what looks like a sturgeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYUS8H_Jhgo) and losing her goggles. Definitely reminded me of TAR.

Desperate to finish the race ahead of the twats, Chip and Dale missed part of their instructions, driving to the finish line instead of going by foot, resulting in a 35 minute penalty. I leapt up from my seat, thinking that Jon and Al might just have a chance!

But they didn't. The gays had avoided team Heave's fate when they crashed and burned in Lisbon. I wish the show would let us know the results at the end of the leg. They always show the start times for the teams, why not give us the end times? For added drama, I guess.

At this point, I think it's anyone's race, and I suppose I have to root for the gays, but with the clowns gone I don't really care who wins. Hopefully I get to watch the final two episodes of this season tonight.",2,1738251523.0,TheAmazingRace,3,0.67,False

1idpo4w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1idpo4w/sister_has_gone_total_waste/,Sister has gone total waste,"We are a family of four. My parents had never been strict and are way too soft spoken. They manage house chores. 

I am the only earning member in my family and it is a toll to bear on my shoulders to feed a family of 4. This makes it literally impossible for me to think about a girlfriend.

 Finally, my sister is older than me but doesn't work anywhere nor does she helps or support the family in any way. My parents do not say much to her as they pity about her career and failed tries in CA (a reputed course offering position for accountant) She tried 3 times and then dropped it.

 Finally, she did bachelors in commerce and stopped studying. On top of it, they don't agree with me scolding her as i am her younger brother. Even if i say it politely that please find some or join workforce, she says she won't be paid worth her efforts and it won't add much to house income so it is useless. She doesn't want to do MBA or other degrees. If i even for a moment, mention about her career, she would be offended and say i am being only money minded. 

If i ask her to help mom in kitchen, she would argue why can't you do it instead. 

This has spoilt her completely. I remember when i used to scold her for not being more disciplined towards her CA exams but she instead lashed angry comments on me. Soon i stopped saying her anything. 

The present state is completely dysfunctional. She is not ready to go down a few blocks to buy her essentials and want me or dad to bring it for her (with an excuse that she would need to dress up). 

She claims that she won't help mom in kitchen as mom is not working according to her !!

 Mom on the other hand, is so blind in her love that she evens goes to her room to give her coffee, take the plate for dinner to her room. Mom believes that this is some sort of help she is providing to her daughter, without realizing that this is spoiling her.

I time and again stop my mom to do so, but if sister listens that i am restricting mom, she would lash out that you are at no position to stop her as she also does things for you. I reply, that what she does is actual help for me as it prevents me from getting late at work. She on the other hand is binging f**king HBO content on her TV.

 In the end, mom wouldn't listen to me and i have already tried it for a year now. She would agree to my words but soon return to her loving mother character. Dad doesn't feel right to say her anything as she dismisses his opinions and talks way bad about him that he considers staying away a better option.

 I am stuck in this shitshow. Today, mom was in restroom, dad was away. Sister was not even ready to open door for me after i returned from office. I had to ring bell 10 times, but she took no responsibility to come even 15 meters to open the gate. She excused that she thought mom would do so always and therefore didn't get up. I had to call her phone and asked to be quickly open the gate and even then she told me why can't you wait a bit.

 I see a dark future till the time she is with me. She says whenever there are people nearby to help her, she completely leaves things to their responsibility as they are not ready to do things her way.

 This attitude of her is so problematic, i remember when we had a fight over tiny matters, she wouldn't care to even order food for me and only order for herself. I on the other hand, would order something for both of us and even go to her room to hand it over.

 This made me cry, how can she be so selfish. Once in a verbal fight, she said extreme pearcing comments on me: saying ""you only know how to earn, and if i stop talking you would come begging for resolution"". It shook my world, i always tried to end the fight and make things normal even if it was her fault.

 It is all so messy. A member of family who is only there to consume. If she works, she only considers her profit. I remember her saying: if i had went to usa, i would do masters and then phd.. (inner thoughts of mine: sis, why would we spend so hefty fees only for you to fulfil your dreams without any return. I thought she would say i would do a job after masters and send something in return, ohh i was so wrong) 

Note: i am not saying she is being inconsiderate our financial condition. What i mean to say is she is not ready to do anything to make it a bit better. All she wants is to travel to places and even then is not ready to bear the burden of booking tickets, hotels. Ooooff, i had enough of it. This zero responsibility and at the same time expecting others to do the job with the pretext she is only giving us the liberty to do things our way is so poisonous. Mom says she would learn when she is married, but hey, what about till then. Mom you are 50+, she is 27 why can't she pick her own freaking meal from the kitchen or even bear the responsibility to handle non-amusing parts of hangouts (booking tickets)

Has anyone else here experienced celiac disease, hyperthyroidism, PCOS, AND binge eating disorder (BED)? This is kind of half-rant, half looking for other people who’ve dealt with the intersection of hyper/Graves and a bunch of other autoimmune issues, especially if you’ve figured out strategies for managing it all. I’m in the midst of them right now, and at times I feel like I’m kind of losing my mind.

I’ve struggled with BED on and off since I was fourteen (I’m in my late twenties now) and I was doing pretty well with it until 2024, when I started having more regular binges again. I was diagnosed with celiac in May, and since restriction is typically a trigger for me, I started binge eating more frequently after switching to a totally gluten free diet. (I figured that if I can’t eat gluten, I can at least treat myself to all the gluten free goodies that I want.) Fast forward to November, and I get diagnosed with PCOS. My gynecologist tells me to cut out \*all added sugars\* and most carbs. (I cry.) I replace almost all of the added sugars I’ve been consuming with fruits and switch to less-processed carbs. Some of my PCOS issues improve (I’m seeing a reduction in acne, less painful menstruation, and my testosterone levels start to go down), but other issues remain or worsen (I’m still having significant hair loss, my heart is racing, and I’m having pretty intense tremors in my hands). I also notice that my appetite is THROUGH THE ROOF, and I start tracking calories again (something I haven’t done in years because it usually triggers binge eating) and discover that I’m eating up to 3,500 calories a day, even though I’ve been losing weight over the past several months. So, my doc checks my TSH, and it comes back as <0.005. Hyperthyroidism it is.

My doctor starts me on 5mg methimazole 3x/day. I start taking it and notice a mild reduction in tremors and some days where my appetite is a bit muted.

I’ve been anxious for pretty much my whole life, but I always figured that this feeling of being on-edge was due to all the stressful things that were happening. (Of course I’m anxious; I’m managing a whole pile of chronic illnesses in addition to regular life stressors! Who wouldn’t be anxious under those circumstances?) But, nope—apparently, when my thyroid isn’t pumping a gazillion gallons of hormones into my system 24/7, I don’t feel like a live wire all the time. I had no idea that so much of my social anxiety and perpetual agitation was related to my hormones, not just \*who I am as a person.\* It almost feels like a spiritual experience to suddenly have this clarity.

I get to experience this new, blissfully calm way of walking through the world for almost a week. Then, disaster strikes. I go out to eat at a restaurant that \*supposedly\* serves celiac-safe meals, but evidently, they do not. I get glutened. I have belly cramps, gas, bloating, diarrhea, and joint pain. I figure, “Well, this sucks, but at least I’ll be feeling back to normal in the next few days or weeks.” But then, I notice something more significant is happening; my methimazole seems to have stopped working. I’m having night sweats and waking up feeling too hot. My hands are shaking again, so badly that I’m having trouble writing. My hunger is once again through the roof, and I’m eating until my jaw muscles hurt, but my body still feels like I’m starving. Worst of all, the calmness that I experienced when the methimazole really took effect has evaporated. I’m back to my anxiety-ridden state, and it almost feels worse now that I know there’s a way of \*not\* feeling this agitated. After some Googling, my hunch as to what happened is that the inflammation in my gut caused by the recent gluten exposure reduced my ability to absorb the medication, so I’m just not getting adequate doses of the methimazole anymore. I have an appointment coming up with my PCP soon, and I’m going to float this theory by her, but it’s my best guess as of yet. I have no idea how long this will last, and it feels awful, like I’m stuck back at square one while I wait for my gut to heal.

So, in the meantime, I’m back to feeling agitated and dealing with all the other hyperthyroidism symptoms, my gut feels \*terrible\* from the combination of being glutened and being absolutely packed with all the food that I’m eating, and I feel so frustrated with myself for binge eating even though I can’t tell how much of this is actually BED-related, or if it’s my body’s increased need for food due to hyperthyroidism.

If any of y’all have been through anything similar, I’d be so grateful to hear what helped you out. (Or just to know that someone else has been through this, too.) I’m fortunate to have a lot of supportive people in my life, but most of them haven’t been through anything quite like this, so sometimes I just feel like a total oddity, and it’s easy to go down a mental spiral of feeling impossibly alone and broken. And if you read this far, thanks for just listening to me rant. <3",1,1738251282.0,gravesdisease,0,1.0,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

*(Since my Redrum joke landed like a wet fart, let’s try this again.)*

Where: Edgewater Public Market (5505 W 20th Ave, Edgewater, CO 80214)

When: Saturday, February 1st, 11AM-1PM (Or until they close and kick us out)

What: Come have an interesting conversation with a friendly stranger! 

Remember when people used to talk to other people? I know, that sounds weird, but it’s better than you’d expect. Is it awkward? Maybe for a minute, but I can almost guarantee you're less awkward than I am. The only rule, no jerks, (thanks u/sleepytawni for that idea, hope you can join!) So come down, get a cup of coffee, introduce yourself, and talk to some new people. It’s a crazy concept, I know, but it works.

How that one turned out: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1id6282/random\_denver\_coffee\_meetup\_went\_well\_no\_murders/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Denver/comments/1id6282/random_denver_coffee_meetup_went_well_no_murders/)

Edgewater Public Market was suggested and it’s a good fit if we have a big crowd. We had 7 people show up last time, but the response has been overwhelmingly positive and I'd hate to have 90 people show up to a coffeeshop the size of my kitchen. This place has lots of great food and drink options, tons of space indoors and out, and plenty of parking.

If this location doesn't work, or the timing sucks, I'm sorry! But don't worry, I hope to start doing this more often, all across town. But there's nothing special about me or anyone else hosting this, just find a place, set a time, and go there. I'm betting people will come. If I'm free, I probably will.

Good news—you don’t have to pick just one! Mixing modern and vintage decor can give your home a unique, stylish vibe. But if you don’t do it right, it can look... chaotic. Don’t worry, I got you! Here’s how to get that perfect balance.

# Pick a Star of the Show

Every room needs a focal point—something that grabs attention and sets the tone. It could be a bold vintage rug, a retro lamp, or a sleek modern sofa. For example, the[ **Jersey Sofa in Green Velvet**](https://midinmod.com/products/jersey-sofa-green-velvet) is a perfect statement piece. It’s modern, but the velvet adds a vintage feel. Throw in a cool antique coffee table next to it, and boom—you’ve got contrast without clashing.



# Keep the Balance 



A good rule: 70% modern, 30% vintage. This keeps things looking intentional instead of like you just threw random stuff together. If most of your furniture is modern, sprinkle in vintage accessories—think old-school lamps, framed art, or an antique mirror. If you’re starting with vintage pieces, balance them out with something clean and simple, like the[ **Marko Solid Wood End Table**](https://midinmod.com/products/marko-solid-wood-end-table).



# Wall Art = Instant Upgrade



A mix of modern and vintage wall art can tie everything together effortlessly. Try blending old-style framed prints with modern abstract pieces. Something like the[ **Sea Whirl Canvas Wall Art**](https://midinmod.com/products/sea-whirl-canvas-wall-art148) or[ **Verdure Canvas Wall Art**](https://midinmod.com/products/verdure-canvas-wall-art164) adds a fresh, modern feel while still keeping things cozy.



# Textures Matter More Than You Think



One of the easiest ways to make modern + vintage work together is by playing with textures. Sleek modern furniture + cozy vintage fabrics = perfection. Think soft velvet, rough wood, smooth metal, and plush rugs. It keeps the room from feeling too stiff or too old-fashioned.



# Final Thoughts 

At the end of the day, your home should feel like *you*. Play around, mix styles, and have fun with it! And if you need modern pieces that still give a nod to vintage, check out[ **Mid in Mod**](https://midinmod.com/)—they have some seriously cool finds that make mixing styles effortless.

CHAPTER III

No one goes to the City

The wagon he embarked on was inside a sad, torn and dissheveled thing, disfigured by the past rages of commuters, and abandoned by any semblance of maintenance. Most of the seats had had their stuffing and springs toyfully pulled out of them, and the walls
were densely matted with graffiti, through which snaked the faint outlines of pictoral dicks. Bardhyl was just content that whichever dark souls progressively degraded his train were cordial enough not to share his commute, and instead confined themselves to the
shadows of his world.

He looked out the window as the train took speed and snaked through the country side. In the field below could be seen the gentle pace of a tractor. No one sat there of course, but the roof has been dismounted and in the drivers seat had been awkwardly manacled a large robotic arm, the kind of which would normally be used on a factory production
line. The arm did its’ best to operate the tractor, hesitantly rushing between the steering wheel and gear shift, oscillating the machine down an imperfect line in the field. The sight of this always tended to cheer Bardhyl, as he, like every past day until now,
contemplated the robots’ inability to effectively replace man, a meditation that marked his commute into the City, maker and giver of all things.

The City gradually came into view, appearing as a pustulation of concrete and steel, becoming increasingly regular and dense. Bardhyl‘s commute for the past year had been a solitary thing, and his ‘people spotting’ had become an increasingly impossible task
from his carriage window. Slowly even the lights from the houses in the hillside had extinguished, until he knew for certain that he was completely alone in traveling to the City - perhaps the last worker ever to commute there.

The travel to the center was composed of two
parts - first the expanse of a thousand useless edifices and things built long ago, a prelude composed of missing roofs, windows and doors. After this came the living core, a Wagnerian triumph to a black monochrome steam punk’s nightmare. The core of the
city was most conspicuous for it‘s smooth, reflective surface, which was in fact a crawling mass of nanomites (also black). This was also why the City was principally abandoned - the nanomites determined who could freely pass.

These robots littered the streets like sand - their origin and purpose had been to once deliver free medical service to whomever walked upon them. Naturally you would have had to walk barefoot, and if the specks could get a whiff of a cancer or heart murmur on your palm, then they would let you sink in
amongst them, five meters deep, holding you faster than quicksand. Post recovery, you would rise to the surface, like a capsized corpse washed ashore. The process was said to quadruple the average human life
span, and had initially attracted thousands to its’ healing shores.

But then, as many others, Bardhyl had heard
that some of the patients had purportedly slipped into the dunes and never resurfaced. Reassurance had been given that this was a perverse speculation on those who required longer treatments, for which reason they
simply stayed longer underneath, but the damage was done, and increasing numbers decided to avoid the City altogether. Bardhyl tried to take neither side of the polemic, but he could not help wonder if the darker shadows that gently drifted beneath the ground were the shades of some trapped human form. 

This was perhaps why he held a total aversion to walking barefoot on the sands, and rather wrapped his shoes in several layers of plastic bags. He would be damned before those little shites got a sniff of his varicose veins, mild hernia and onset of glucoma.

As the train’s pace began to slow down, Bardhyl fixed his protection to his shoes. The speaker garbled an incomprehensible message, and then the doors opened, allowing the black sand to seep onboard. He
carefully overstepped this wave and continued on through the station into the City itself.
After already no more than a minute‘s walking,
he suddenly heard the sound of someone running. He froze, caught unawares as he had believed that the city was well and truly empty. 

Someone was running in his direction, the footfalls dampened by the nanomites. A figure appeared through the smog, but it
was not human. It was a thing, a bizarrely tinkered contraption, made up of two slender robotic legs upon which had been cruelly welded a heavy set antique TV.
The thing ran with less purpose and more under the struggle to compensate the weight of its‘ load, the screen jumping between static and black. This too perhaps had been the handiwork of those barbarians,
always at work some place just beyond Bardhyl‘s horizon. The thing paid no attention to him, running past into a side alley. And then silence once more - a brief encounter, a bizarre revelation better left unknown, punctuating his solitary trail.

In his distraction, he had allowed the sand to
seek its‘ way over his plastic: He shook his leg in a panic and knocked it against the tip of a lamp post for good measure. The empty socket of the lamp post resonated, and Bardhyl who preferred inattention, quickly walked on in embarrassment. Roth corporation was an impressive architectural design - it was the perfect emulation of the screwed up piece of paper upon which Mr Roth the founder had written his pre-eminent inspiration for global automation. His son, the second Roth, had
found it curled up within his father‘s palm on his deathbed, and the story goes that rather then unfold and read it, he confined it to a glass case, from which its‘ legend was naturally spun to greater lengths over
time. The building even copied the fragments of words that could be spied within the folds of the paper, but none had ever managed to successfully read it in full.

At the entrance to the building sat a metallic
sphere, which had in fact fallen from its’ mount some months prior, and lay sunken midway in the sand. A pale blue bubble drifted to the surface where Bardhyl placed his hand, and instantly the entire building emitted a symphony of clicks, like a box of Geiger
counters dropped into a radioactive mine shaft. A piece of the paper unfolded: the entrance to his place of work.
 
Inside, the space had been appropriated by and adapted exclusively for robots: they slid in tubes like fungi and tip toed with spider like legs through holes in the walls, crawling over a dense mat of ill managed wires. Only the stair case had been begrudgingly left as a vestige of the office past, or as an acknowledgement to Bardhyl‘s particular ‘human’ accessibilility needs. Conveniently, it stopped at the
third floor, precisely where his desk was situated.

The floor itself was pitch black, but he knew the way off by heart. He navigated through the darkness and in amongst the hum of ventilators, feeling his way to the small switch of his desk lamp. He was placed, as
he called it, in the pod room. All around him hung gigantic pods like bulbous wasp nests, vibrating incessantly, no doubt engaged in some task beyond his mortal comprehension. 

He took off his hat, scarf and Trenchcoat, folding them neatly over the back of his
chair. The time was now 8:05 - he had achieved another day on time much to the relief of his crippling anxiety, and could now peacefully sit and contemplate the absurdity of his position for the remaining eight and a half hours of his working day. The realisation and horror one would expect to torture him daily, was only imperfectly managed by
Bardhyl. He had been accustomed to his situation by gradual steps, each a momentary shock followed by his inevitable capitulation. Habit and time had worn down the sting of any worthwhile realisation on his condition, and besides, the small candle of pride that
he held above others, that he indeed still did go to work, kept him going, if only to appear slightly better off than his peers.

The first pod had been fixed to the ceiling
almost twelve years ago. Management had made it the centrepiece of the open working space - a work of art, beautiful to behold but simultaneously purposeful in furthering the corporation’s productivity. The CEO had made a quip about turning the world of work upside down („because the pod is upside down“ someone had pedantically whispered to Bardhyl‘s left, obviously eager for his colleagues to share in the mirth of their superior. “Looks like a ball sack“ another whispered over his right shoulder). At the time, he could not recall whether any explanation
had actually been given over what the pod was intended to do.

The common apprehension was that it was
listening to everything, and reporting on up. It‘s most particular feature was the spherical aperture at its‘ base. It was a hole big enough for someone to crawl up inside. But as the pod hung too close down to the ground, you would have had to crawl on your back to get a good look inside, and naturally office decorum
forbade such a manoeuvre during working hours. Even now, as he sat alone, Bardhyl had still not succumbed to his curiosity and stuck his head under the pod. Perhaps it was because he had been visited by a recurring dream where he was walking into the
office to retrieve something forgotten (an umbrella, hat, scarf...the details varied from night to night). As he came into the open space, there on the floor would be the CEO, looking up directly into the pod and laughing without restraint, the laugh of a man suddenly unburdened from all sorrow. He would
glance in Bardhyl‘s direction, then lift his head into the pod, and begin ascending into it. As fast as he could run, Bardhyl could never get there in time to free him.

He clung to his legs as they kicked him furiously back, and were swallowed upwards. The dream ended, but the image would remain with him, and so any time he felt like looking, he would be struck with the sight of the painful laugh of his former boss, a laugh full of abandonment, a face through which
emotion poured out like the impossible wrenching of a wet cloth.

On Bardhyl‘s desk were arranged a series of toys and souvenirs. It had been a former supervisor‘s idea that all the employees bring in their ‚totems‘: small objects that carried spiritual and emotional weight. Bardhyl had preserved them ever since in a drawer,
and only recently had relocated them amongst his papers. Each totem held the potent recollection of a colleague, and for some was the remaining bridge in his memory to them.

The plastic t-rex painted in a repulsive bright green and red had belonged to Kyle Maffin, a senior cost controller. Upon presenting it to the group, he had claimed to have fished it out of a forgotten toy box from his childhood, and that this piece had always been his favourite. The piece was less than exceptional - mass
produced and sold at every corner shop and gas station. Perhaps it betrayed a childhood of want, or the man simply was of humble taste. Everyone had felt slightly sorry for Karl as he had shared it, and the ancient beast, the lizard tyrant king looked almost pitiful in its plastic imitation. Decidedly, Bardhyl had thought, Kyle‘s parents had been mean not to at least
procure a beast of higher quality. Amongst the other ornaments that littered his desk
stood:

One picture of a cat he had never heard mention,

One wind up tin fire truck driven by
monkeys,

One clay figurine, obviously made by a
child, of a figure whose face lay merged in
its‘ stomach, the words ‚I love you
mummy‘ etched in an arc above its backside,

One silver fork, two prongs missing, 

And one travel sized bottle of whiskey.

Bardhyl‘s own memento was a very large and
sharp safety pin. He remembered his father had given it to him as a testament to his trust in his responsible young boy. The pin was long enough to reach the heart, his father had said, words which produced nothing but pride in his infant self at being awarded the safe keeping of such a dangerous object, but words also which later on did not ring in his memory with
the paternal love that he thought he had so cherished. Thus surrounded, so to speak, by his memento mori, Bardhyl wandered, adrift on a desk sized raft in a tempest made of industrial ventilators, his present
moment an unfolding and refolding of the past.
The silver fork had always stood at the coffee
machine - lamenting over the inefficiency of his colleagues, yet supporting it with a comic fatality. The whiskey bottle was perpetually sick, and in his rare appearances affected the image of a man overcome with work, hounded and hunted down by it like as a fox by pack of mad dogs. The tin fire truck had always
been at his desk before Bardhyl arrived, remaining without exception until after the last man had left.

But the picture of the cat had been his friend,
albeit from afar, a person whose congeniality volubly announced a jovial co- conspiracy to assure all on lookers that at least one good man was here alive in this office. „Don‘t make the rest of us look bad, Mr Imron“, he would quip whilst passing his desk, or „make sure the project for the board gets delivered on
time Bardhyl“, he would pat him on the shoulder, perhaps suggesting that he saw straight through Bardhyl‘s ruse, and all the more kept it safe between them by getting the office gossips off his scent.

This and other such remembrances Bardhyl
indulged in, poking at the embers of his nostalgia. And yet he could not help but equally observe that he felt absolutely no pain or regret in the absence of his colleagues.
His reasoning for this was simple - his former
life among men had been one punctuated by a rhythm of probable gestures and feints: the hanging of a coat, the clinking of a spoon carried in a mug to the coffee machine, the furious underlining, highlighting and
crossing out of lines upon paper later to be shredded, the chattering of keyboard keys and the performative answering of phones. All this was the sound of people working, but only the sound and nothing more. The real people here had always been absent - they had
left their selves behind with their loved ones, and here paraded their shells. As such, their disappearance was unremarkable, more like the melting of a ghost beneath a floating cloth than the loss of anything real.

Now, albeit without people, there was a similar
regularity to the things that scuttled, the curious optic assemblies that peered at him from round corners, the murmur in the pipes and the snap of the current in some stray wires. They perhaps did not drink coffee,
but they were similarly filled with their quirks and habits, some of which he had grown strangely accustomed to. And in turn he gave back as good as he saw: to the platonic shadows and shapes of existence
played out against his cave wall, he matched with his own appearances and feints. To him work had never been anything more than the stillness of a stick insect, moving in a forest of eyes. The eyes perhaps had changed, but they continued to watch him, and so he
continued to perform, and pretend to work.
His position however afforded him a curious
vantage point over his mechanical peers: through constant observation they took on the qualities of peculiar characters, and small gestures that would appear meaningless to any outsider, would to him stand out as a strange and meaningful deviations from
their productive cycle. It had been hard to humanise his human peers -that had been an a priori condition he was expected to see in them. But these robots seemed all the more relatable precisely for the fact that he had gifted them their relatability. But of all these characters, outlined in the finest
and inconspicuous of mechanical gestures, the most perfidious and unbearable to Bardhyl, was the inbuilt monitor to his cantina tray. Like every available space
in the building, the lunch hall had been repurposed as a data warehouse, an open space with tall ceilings, now filled with enourmous black server towers. It was
here that Bardhyl came to eat, for the meals delivered by the electronic caterer.

The insidious nature of this cantina tray could
no doubt only be made apparent by the keenly
persistent observer. The actual screen was dead, but the small array of LED lights remained operable - three blue dots that would flicker with random intensity. One day, as Bardhyl was peaceably masticating on
something that resembled a perfect cylinder of a baked sweet potato, he fell into the habit of
murmuring out his thoughts. And as he did so, the three lights turned on in succession as if registering the variation in a sound wave. He stopped, and the lights ceased, he spoke, and they registered the cadence of his speech once more. He barked and they shot up in frenzy. He whispered and a single blue eye
blinked hesitantly. Surprised by this behaviour, he did something he would live to regret - he asked the cantina tray its‘ name.

Normally such a question would have been
drowned out by the whirring ventilators of the servers, but this time they all simultaneously plunged into a sudden and irregular silence, to which his words rang out through the large space: „What‘s your name?“.

Instead of responding in playful kind, the lights
went out. Then, after a few moments, the space was drowned once more in the din of the ventilators. At the time, Bardhyl dismissed a feintly perceived offence as the paranoia of his regular isolation. But in retrospect, he could now see it as the first of many insults he had suffered at the twisted humour of this
cantina tray. On the second occasion, the tray -normally paired with his name, which would display above the menu selection once placed on the conveyor belt - had generated the name Barbara instead. This name was all the more displaced as Barbara had been the name of a project manager who had kissed him one year at an office party. They had never spoke of it afterward, but he had always wondered - did her soul too similarly stir every time he passed her, or had she forgot him the moment their lips had parted? When he
often wondered anxiously whether he had lived well, or had wasted his time in the dead end of a career, staring up at the ceiling in the evenings after work, his mind would go back to Barbara as a consolation, and a regret.

To think that this kiss had somehow been seen by the scheming miniaturised intellect that inhabited this tray confounded him. His better sense tried to reason it as pure coincidence, a happenstance that he gave intent to simulate the companionship of some kind. But the point of this happenstance seemed too sharp, too deliberately thrust into the steady sails of his
composure. He knew when he was being made fun of. And perplexingly enough, it was in front of this tray that he felt seen as a fool and an imposter for the first time - he felt that it knew everything about him, and only desired to mock his suffering.",1,1738250426.0,FreeEBOOKS,0,1.0,False

1idp83h,https://www.reddit.com/r/SaaS/comments/1idp83h/7_ways_slow_growth_saved_me_from_burnout/,7 ways slow growth saved me from burnout,"When I started Jotform, I knew one thing: I didn’t want to burn out.

I wasn’t interested in working 100-hour weeks, pulling all-nighters, and sacrificing my health just to “make it.” I never bought into that hustle-culture mentality.

From day one, I was intentional about growing slowly. Sustainably. And eighteen years and 25 million users later, I’m still passionate and energetic about my work.

Here are 7 things I did to avoid burnout — and how slow growth kept me balanced and energized along the way.

# 1. I set the right pace

I knew that trying to “move fast and break things” would likely end up breaking me too. So I made sure as Jotform grew it did so at a pace I could handle.

Luckily, since I bootstrapped it, I was able to do that without pressure from investors. I could focus on steady growth without feeling like I had to rush to meet someone else's short-term target or sacrifice my well-being. 

# 2. I focused on small wins

I still remember the thrill of reaching our first 10 users and then our first 1,000. I celebrated each win with as much enthusiasm as when I would later celebrate our first million. Focusing only on big, distant milestones can be exhausting and disheartening — you’ve got to focus on the small, incremental wins. Every feature. Every happy customer.

Those small wins kept me motivated and moving forward without feeling like I was taking on too much. They also reminded me that steady progress is just as valuable ᅳ if not more so ᅳ than fast growth.

# 3. I said “no” more often

As a founder, it's tempting to say yes to every new idea, feature request, and opportunity. But that's a fast track to burnout. Luckily, growing slowly took away the pressure to do everything at once and made saying “no” a lot easier.

I got comfortable turning people down. I said “no” to distractions, “no” to unnecessary features, and sometimes even “no” to that extra cup of coffee I knew would keep me up into the night. Saying “no” gave me the focus I needed to keep stress low and energy high. It's how I kept Jotform moving forward without exhausting myself or the team.

# 4. I rested without guilt

Intentionally growing slowly gave me the freedom to rest without guilt. 

Running a startup isn’t like a nine-to-five job. You think about it all the time. But just like your body needs rest, so does your mind. Without rest, focus wanes.

I don’t work weekends, not just because I want to spend time with my family but also because I need to stay sharp. If I don’t rest, the next week feels harder, and it’s less productive as well.

Vacations help too. For me, picking olives at my family’s grove in Turkey is my reset. It’s physically tiring, but it clears my head. You don’t have to pick olives — any physical activity works. The important thing is to step away, recharge, and come back ready.

# 5. I hired slowly and thoughtfully

[Slow growth](https://www.jotform.com/blog/hire-slowly-grow-slowly/) gave me the time and space to find the right people — people who fit our culture and shared my vision. No rushed hires. No time wasted onboarding an employee who would soon leave. I got the right people at the right time. And I took some weight off my shoulders while doing it.

Make sure you hire a team as soon as you can. But don’t rush the process of hiring.

# 6. I quit the comparison game

It’s hard not to compare yourself to other startups that seem to be growing faster, raising more money, or hitting bigger milestones. But don’t. It’s a waste of energy. And “keeping up with the Joneses” is a surefire way to burn out.

I felt less pressure once I accepted that Jotform’s growth was on its own timeline. I focused on my path and no one else’s. That mindset shift helped me enjoy the process more and stress less about keeping up.

# 7. I played the long game

The best part about growing slowly? It let me play the long game.

While others sprinted for quick wins, I focused on building a company designed to last. Jotform has been around for 18 years, with over 25 million users, because I made long-term decisions. With no investors to satisfy with quick money, I built a truly sustainable company.

It’s what kept me in the game for the long haul.

# Learning from burnout

Those seven factors saved me, but I won’t pretend I haven’t exhausted myself from time to time. I’ve felt the burn, just as most founders have.

A few years ago, I started spending most of my days in meetings, which left me drained at the end of each day and began robbing me of the joy I usually found in my work. It happens. The important thing is that I made a change.

After the birth of my third child, I decided to take an eight-month break to focus on family and promote my book. When I returned, I restructured my time. Now, I focus on five key areas of the business, dedicating each day to one. This gave me the space to think more clearly and brought back the energy I needed to stay passionate about my work. It also allowed me to reconnect with parts of the work I truly enjoy.

Not everyone can take months off, but you don’t need to. A few focused changes — like setting clear priorities and learning to say “no” — can be the difference between shining and burning out.",2,1738250261.0,SaaS,2,1.0,False

We wanted to clean up our counter…grinder, espresso machine, pour over set up. So we just got the NLC about a week ago, and dialed it in over a couple of days. So far this machine does both well enough for us, with quality we each enjoy.

My problem is the water volume for coffee. I make an 18 oz using the quad portafilter in a 20 oz yeti mug. The first few days, it made 18 (or close to) oz. The last few days though, it seems the volume has shrunk. Because of the cup size, I know I’m not getting 18 oz anymore, more like 12.

No grind settings or beans have changed. I tried the higher water to bean ratio which did nothing for overall volume but make the coffee slightly weaker. I tried the rich vs classic settings, nothing. 

The machine/portafilter can’t possibly need a clean or descale this quickly. I love the machine but want my big cup of coffee back. What’s wrong?",2,1738250213.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,2,1.0,False

The plumb in kit that comes with my machine mentioned in the subject has a fitting to go on the water supply - I think its 1/2 inch - and it has a small rough disk inside the fitting.  I don't know what it is for.  Is it some sort of filter - it might be porous, I can't really tell, or is it perhaps to reduce pressure?  I already have 1/4 inch fitting on the supply side - it's a new house and they plumbed for my coffee machine basically like a fridge ice maker.  My house has a whole house RO water filter system - so not worried about filtering, but the pressure aspect is more worrying... does anyone know what this disk is for?  I've been googling and not finding anything and the plumbing install videos for my machine don't mention this disk at all.

1idp24o,https://www.reddit.com/r/GuyCry/comments/1idp24o/found_out_recently_our_relationship_started_with/,"Found out recently our relationship started with infidelity, now almost 2 years in and feeling broken.","TL/DR:  Girlfriend of almost 2 years cheated on me one time, just a week or so into dating. I found out a year and a half later. Trying not to let my emotions ruin a beautiful committed relationship that we have now, while trying to view the cheating in the context of what we were then.



I (39m) met my partner (41f) 2 years ago on a hookup site.  We were both divorcees looking to let loose and have some fun after wasting our younger years on bad marriages.  As fate would have it, we found each other and fell deeply in love.  That trajectory has been consistent, and the past 2 years have been some of the greatest of my life, from a relational standpoint.  I’ve never felt more loved, been more supported, or felt so grateful to be alive and partnered to this beautiful person.  I have embraced the term ""soulmate"" in how I feel about this woman.

Make no mistake, our beginnings were shallow - we fucked the first time we met (after about a week of messaging).  And it absolutely does not hurt that our sex is the best I've ever had.  But more than that, we always had a great relational chemistry that I think is a lot more uncommon than the physical attraction.  It did not take us long to fall for each other.  And we generally liked our non-traditional story... telling friends we met online, that the sex was as good as the friendship, how we “fell in love backwards” and couldn’t have planned a better relationship for this second stage of life - we never shied away from acknowledging the non traditional road map our relationship took.    

As you can assume, we were both playing the field at the time we met.  I had been enjoying hook up culture for years (although admittedly getting tired of it).  She was freshly out of a marriage and I was one of the first guys she matched with.  I more or less encouraged her non monogamous approach, and appreciated that she wasn’t expecting any sort of exclusive relationship with me.  We even joked about her embarking on what she called “The Great Fuckening”.

Whoops.

3 months in I had caught feelings.  She had too.  We were operating at that point on a “don’t ask, don’t tell” policy.  Still seeing other people, but developing a level of intimacy that made it uncomfortable to imagine each other with other people.  I broke down first.  Not dramatically, but I couldn’t help showing my discomfort when she referenced another partner.  She instantly read it and asked if she had “killed the warm fuzzies”… she was always so cute with phrases like that.  I confessed that I was finding it hard not to feel some sort of way.  I felt INCREDIBLY hypocritical.  I was still sleeping around (albeit less, and more as a coping mechanism), and I had spoken so much with her about my ability to keep things fun and drama free.  She would confide in me that she had similar feelings.  We both prioritized scheduling dates with each other over other partners.  I knew I was special to her, and that I was the best partner, both physically and relationally, that she had.  But I also knew she was still newer to hookup culture than me.  And with all of it’s many foibles, she was still enjoying the thrills associated with it.  And I knew that if I was to ask her to enter something monogamous, I would be pulling her out of something long anticipated, prematurely.

I didn’t even have to ask.

She saw my pain.  She didn’t want to risk losing me.  Even if she wasn’t having as hard of a time as I was, there was still some discomfort on her end with me sleeping around too.  She offered a “pause” on seeing other people.  She suggested taking time for us to just date each other and figure out if that is what we wanted.  I told her I felt horrible about changing the rules of the game, but she reiterated again and again that she was ok being monogamous, and that she was happy scaling back.  She swatted away my feelings of guilt by suggesting we could talk about it again in a month and see if we still were liking monogamy.  She also eased my guilt by saying she had already called it off with a couple partners, and made a point to set a coffee date with a current partner to explain the situation and call things off with him.  I followed her lead and did the same.  Embarrassed to say that a couple of women I was seeing infrequently I just ghosted on.  But another who was a little closer to me I did make a point of explaining the situation and officially had a ""goodbye"" conversation.  I promptly deleted my dating site accounts, blocked contacts, deleted old messages, etc. 

We never looked back.  Or at least mostly. That’s where the heartbreak comes in.  But first, to contextualize and validate the relationship:

During the few weeks that we talked through the decision to become monogamous we had started to openly tell each other “I love you”.  Neither of us had done that since our ex spouses and we had never thrown the expression around lightly during our younger dating years.  So it was appropriately significant.  We also moved in leaps and bounds catching each other up on our “real selves”.  Sharing openly a lot more about our past histories, our families, our careers, our kids, etc.  Catching up on all of the stuff that a typical dating couple would have done long before the first kiss.  Again, our personalities were like two peas in a pod, but we were now backfilling all of the steps we had missed along the way.  And there were no red flags, no hiccups.  We fell in love deeper and deeper as the weeks turned into months turned into years.

Fast forward to recent times.

While out at dinner, my girlfriend showed me that she still had the old messaging app we had used for anonymous communications with hookup partners.  She hadn't opened it in forever, and the flirty joke she was making at the time was that former guys she had broken up with were still shooting their shot.  In the context of the moment it was meant to be an ego booster to me (the guy who came out on top), or just a type of silly reminiscing about our early days.  I took it as such... but of course I wasn't immune to insecurities.  It was odd to me that she didn't delete it, but I knew she wasn't the type to delete stuff off her phone.  I also felt weird that she had occasionally checked it, especially since even the act of reading (but not replying) to a message shows as activity to the sender.  But I didn't say anything.  I wish I had, but I don't know if that would have made things any better.

In a twist of fate, I ended up having unsupervised access to her phone not long after, for the first time ever.  We had just shared our passwords in the case of an emergency.  And then, she left her phone in my car after a weekend getaway.  I can honestly say it wasn't on my mind to check.  But the next day, while opening her phone to check something on her behalf, the insecurities crept back in.  I shouldn't have violated her trust, but within 30 minutes of the idea being planted, I was on her phone looking into the messaging app.

What I found broke my heart.

It turned out she had not cut things off as cleanly when she had offered monogamy and agreed to start seeing each other exclusively.  There was a hookup that came roughly 2 weeks after our ""official relationship start"" as defined by agreeing on monogamy, breaking up with other people, and (what really hurts) starting to say ""I love you"".  I'm not great at remembering or saving significant dates.  I would have loved to tell myself that the timing was not what it seemed... that the hookup came just right before and I must be misremembering our relationship timeline.  But unfortunately the messages were crystal clear, in the most callous of ways.  In her messaging before and after the hookup she jokingly referenced me to the other guy as someone who had caught feelings and was clingy.  She spoke about promising to be monogamous, pointing out that it was clearly a lie, and that she didn't feel guilty at all.  All intermixed with comments about the sex and the fun they were having.  It was some of the most fucked up shit I could imagine.

That was the only hookup that happened, and I do believe that with certainty.  The messaging was all there, nothing would have been off the app.  But that's the next brutal part - the messaging continued for 3 more months, well into some of the most cherished memories of our early relationship.  While we were growing closer together and having some very big milestones, she was occasionally messaging this guy in an explicitly sexual nature.  The messaging was infrequent, but consistent.  And there were no saving graces to it.  As in, he would sometimes send her unsolicited messages that would lead to sexual conversations.. but she was just as guilty of that too - occasionally being the one to send an unsolicited message.  So it really wasn't a one sided thing.  And what went from a hookup that was definitely not causing any guilt, just slowly downshifted.  It never got called off officially.  Meaning it went from talking about the next hookup as if it was a definite thing... to talking about looking forward to the next time in more vague terms... to (after 3 months) her still leading him on with ""maybe"" and kiss emojis when he was trying to set something up.  She never actually said ""hey, I'm dating someone now and need to stop"".  FYI, this guy was from out of town.  I'm 100% convinced that there would have been multiple hookups before things tapered off, given the nature of the conversations.

So that's where my reality is - this is only a few months old, in my mind.  Even though it was a year and a half ago.

I immediately confronted my girlfriend and the fallout was rough.  We broke up for a couple of days, and then went through an intense 6 weeks or so of gaslighting.  She was understandably furious that I looked on her phone, and I admitted that it was a breach of trust, wrong, illegal, etc.  She also struggled to come up with answers or even full recollections of her actions at that time.  She said these conversations were pretty meaningless to her, and forgettable, so it felt like being on trial for something done by someone else - that the time elapsed made it impossible for any sort of closure.  But for me, they obviously did happen.  And they weren't aligned with the love that she was professing to me daily at that time.  The gaslighting was nearly as heart breaking as the cheating.  All manner of cold and defensive reasoning from her. ""They were just messages with a friend"", ""women flirt as a means of communication"", ""maybe I was just in a weird place because of my ex spouse"", ""If you had asked to look, I would have shown you the texts and it wouldn't have been as bad"", ""surely the dates must be mixed up/the messages couldn't have really meant what they said"", ""I sounded cruel in my references towards you because I was just trying on a personality"".... tons more.  Coupled with angry statements like ""I can't say anything that will make you feel better"", ""I'll never be able to explain it"", ""don't expect me to beg for forgiveness"", etc.

Eventually through many tears and difficult conversations on both sides, we finally got to a place of healing.  She recanted all of the gaslighting.  She admitted it was the definition of cheating, even if very early in our decision to be monogamous, and acknowledged that the messaging was wrong and shouldn't have happened.

I'm relieved for that.  She's a very empathetic person.  Normally very kind and compassionate.  And outside of this, had pretty much never done wrong by me.  But that meant she is also not great at admitting fault or asking for forgiveness.  But she did, and I forgave her.

But the damage feels done.  And that's why I'm struggling today.  I don't know how to get the thoughts of the cheating out of my head.  The act of it.  The specifics of the sex they had and discussed.  The timing of messages sent during some of my favorite milestones with her.  The gaslighting that I had to endure to get to a place where we could start reconciling.  I don't believe it will happen again, I say that honestly.  But that doesn't make it hurt any less.

I 100% believe that throwing away the relationship that we've built in the time since then, would be wrong.  The punishment would not fit the crime.  I would also be hurting myself by giving up the best person I've ever loved.  The person that I've loved the most, by far.  So I continue on loving her and being loved by her.  Our days and nights together are great.  In our times apart, I feel the negative thoughts creep back in.  I desperately want to remove the memory of it all from my head.  Find a way for my brain to communicate to my heart that it happened a long time ago, she's human, and that we are not in the same relatively shallow place we were back then, even if we had started dating and saying ""I love you""

Anyone who made it to the end of this post, I appreciate you.  I just needed to vent.  I don't have friends I can talk to about this, because I don't want to tarnish her reputation in their eyes.  I briefly tried therapy but I found it cost, and more importantly - time prohibitive.  I'd love to get any sort of encouragement from men who have been cheated on but found a way to grow their relationship even deeper after the transgression.  I'd love to hear any women who might be able to add some perspective and humanity on the reasons why a woman would engage in this type of behavior.  I'd love to just feel heard when I've already spoken about my pain to my girlfriend more than I care to... after the genuine apology she's kept the door open to let me vent and discuss this as needed, but I don't want to strain our relationship with something I fear I can't get over.

She was panicking about what to wear. She asked me to use a Tide bleach pen on a white blazer to get a stain out, which I did, but then she realized it looked too “ostentatious” and decided against it. Then she realized she didn’t have anything except a grey blazer and black dress pants and a green top. When she came downstairs to show me her outfit, I enthusiastically told her that she looked good, but she wasn’t convinced and said that the pants and blazer didn’t match very well. Then I tried to compliment her again and then she asked me not to lie to her. I tried to be as constructive as possible and said, “don’t worry, we can look into getting you matching pants/blazers soon,” which I think went over well. Then I made her a coffee and she started to leave. But then when she was walking out the door, I told her, “remember, they’re there for what you say, not for how you look,” and she just stared at me like I cut her with a knife.  As she was walking to her car she turned and said, “geeze, I didn’t think I looked THAT bad…” and walked away. I tried to clarify, but she wasn’t having any of it.

Why settle for mass-produced furniture when you can create a custom masterpiece? Hand-painting furniture is a great way to breathe new life into old pieces. Whether it's a dresser with intricate floral patterns or a coffee table with a vintage distressed finish, personalized furniture adds a unique touch to any home. According to a 2022 report by Houzz, 39% of homeowners opted for DIY furniture updates rather than purchasing new ones, highlighting the growing preference for customization.

**3. Engraved and Personalized Wooden Decor**

Wooden home accessories like cutting boards, picture frames, and shelves can be easily personalized with engraving. Laser-engraved quotes, family names, or significant dates can turn a simple wooden piece into a cherished keepsake. A study by Research and Markets states that the global wood engraving market is growing at a CAGR of 6.4%, emphasizing the rising popularity of personalized wooden décor.

**4. Photo Wall Collages and Personalized Art Prints**

Wall art is an essential component of home décor, and adding a personal touch can make it even more special. Creating a gallery wall with family photos, travel memories, or personalized art prints is a popular trend. According to HomeAdvisor, over 65% of homeowners prefer decorating their walls with personal photos rather than store-bought art, making it a sentimental and stylish choice.

**5. Handmade Candles with Custom Scents**

Scent plays a significant role in creating a cozy home ambiance. Handmade candles with personalized scents and labels add a thoughtful touch to any room. DIY candle-making kits have gained popularity, with the handmade candle market expected to reach $5.6 billion by 2026, as per Grand View Research. You can experiment with essential oils, colors, and decorative jars to create the perfect candle for your space.

**6. Personalized Nameplates and Door Signs**

Adding a customized nameplate to your front door or bedroom is a simple way to showcase personality. Whether it’s a rustic wooden sign, a sleek metal plate, or a playful chalkboard, a personalized nameplate enhances your home's entrance. Etsy reports that personalized home signage sales have increased by 23% in the past two years, reflecting a growing demand for unique home accents.

**7. DIY Mason Jar Organizers**

Mason jars are versatile and functional decor items that can be transformed into custom storage solutions. By painting, labeling, or etching them with unique designs, you can create personalized holders for kitchen utensils, bathroom essentials, or office supplies. A report from the Craft & Hobby Association (CHA) states that upcycling household items into functional decor has seen a 34% rise in popularity, making DIY mason jar projects a trending home accessory.

**8. Handmade Rugs and Doormats**

Adding a customized rug or doormat to your home entryway is a fun and practical way to personalize your space. Hand-painted or stenciled doormats with quirky messages, family names, or seasonal designs create a warm welcome. According to Statista, the demand for handcrafted home textiles, including rugs and mats, has grown by 19% annually, highlighting the shift towards personalized home fashion.

**9. Customized Kitchen Accessories**

From engraved wooden spoons to personalized aprons, customizing kitchen accessories is a great way to blend function with aesthetics. Monogrammed dish towels, personalized cutting boards, and custom spice labels make cooking spaces more enjoyable. The global personalized kitchen accessories market is expected to reach $12.4 billion by 2027, showing the high demand for tailored culinary décor.

**10. DIY Wall Murals and Decals**

Wall murals and removable decals allow homeowners to add artistic elements without permanent changes. Whether it’s a hand-painted accent wall or a custom quote decal, wall art personalization is a growing trend. According to Home Design Trends, 41% of millennials prefer peel-and-stick wall decals as an alternative to traditional wallpaper, making it a flexible and creative décor choice.

**11. Handcrafted Planters and Greenery Displays**

Indoor plants add life to a home, and personalized planters make them even more special. Hand-painted terracotta pots, macramé plant hangers, or DIY plant labels can enhance greenery displays. Market research indicates that sales of custom planters have surged by 27% in the past year, showcasing the increasing trend of indoor gardening combined with personalization.

1idopkz,https://www.reddit.com/r/FamilyIssues/comments/1idopkz/sister_has_gone_total_waste/,Sister has gone total waste,"We are a family of four.
My parents had never been strict and are way too soft spoken. They manage house chores.

I am the only earning member in my family and it is a toll to bear on my shoulders to feed a family of 4. This makes it literally impossible for me to think about a girlfriend.

Finally, my sister is older than me but doesn't work anywhere nor does she helps or support the family in any way.

My parents do not say much to her as they pity about her career and failed tries in CA (a reputed course offering position for accountant) She tried 3 times and then dropped it. Finally, she did bachelors in commerce and stopped studying.

On top of it, they don't agree with me scolding her as i am her younger brother. Even if i say it politily that please find some or join workforce, she says she won't be paid worth her efforts and it won't add much to house income so it is useless. She doesn't want to do MBA or other degrees. If i even for a moment, mention about her career, she would be offended and say i am being only money minded. 

If i ask her to help mom in kitchen, she would argue why can't you do it instead. 

This has spoilt her completely. I remember when i used to scold her for not being more disciplined towards her CA exams but she instead lashed angry comments on me. Soon i stopped saying her anything.

The present state is completely dysfunctional. 

She is not ready to go down a few blocks to buy her essentials and want me or dad to bring it for her (with an excuse that she would need to dress up). 

She claims that she won't help mom in kitchen as mom is not working according to her !!

Mom on the other hand, is so blind in her love that she evens goes to her room to give her coffee, take the plate for dinner to her room. Mom believes that this is some sort of help she is providing to her daughter, without realizing that this is spoiling her.

I time and again stop my mom to do so, but if sister listens that i am restricting mom, she would lash out that you are at no position to stop her as she also does things for you. I reply, that what she does is actual help for me as it prevents me from getting late at work. 
She on the other hand is binging f**king HBO content on her TV.

In the end, mom wouldn't listen to me and i have already tried it for a year now. Dad doesn't feel right to say her anything as she dismisses his opinions and talks way bad about him that he considers staying away a better option.

I am stuck in this shitshow. Today, mom was in restroom, dad was away. Sister was not even ready to open door for me after i returned from office. I had to ring bell 10 times, but she took no responsibility to come even 15 meters to open the gate. She excused that she thought mom would do so as always and therefore didn't get up. I had to call her phone and asked to be quickly open the gate and even then she told me why can't you wait a bit.

I see a dark future till the time she is with me. She says whenever there are people nearby to help her, she completely leaves things to their responsibility as they are not ready to do things her way. 

This attitude of her is so problematic, i remember when we had a fight over tiny matters, she wouldn't care to even order food for me and only order for herself. I on the other hand, would order something for both of us and even go to her room to hand it over. This made me cry, how can she be so selfish.

Once in a verbal fight, she said extreme pearcing comments on me: saying ""you only know how to earn, and if i stop talking you would come begging for resolution"". It shook my world, i always tried to end the fight and make things normal even if it was her fault.

It is all so messy. A member of family who is only there to consume. If she works, she only considers her profit. 

I remember her saying: if i had went to usa, i would do masters and then phd.. (inner thoughts of mine: Dude, why would we spend so hefty fees only for you to fulfil your dreams without any return. I thought she would say i would do a job after masters and send something in return, ohh i was so wrong)

Note: i am not saying she is being inconsiderate of our financial condition. What i mean to say is she is not ready to do anything to make it a bit better. All she wants is to travel to places and even then is not ready to bear the burden of booking tickets, hotels.

 Ooooff, i had enough of it. This zero responsibility and at the same time expecting others to do the job with the pretext she is only giving us the liberty to do things our way is so poisonous.

 Mom says she would learn when she is married, but hey, what about till then. Mom you are 50+, she is 27 why can't she pick her own freaking meal from the kitchen or even bear the responsibility to handle non-amusing parts of hangouts (booking tickets)",1,1738248860.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

I am from Nashville. My friends and family are all here. There are things we like and don't like about living here. The main problem is that my wife has no friends. She just can't seem to click with any of the people here. We are mid-40s with no kids. So that is unusual in this area. She doesn't drink and I drink very little which is unusual as well here. I think people are put off by her accent as well. There are not many Europeans here.

I genuinely don't understand it as she is the sweetest and kindest person I've ever met. Volunteers at our local animal shelter. She loves animals, baking, hiking, crocheting, etc.. She's used to just getting coffee or tea and talking with a friend back in Ukraine. Or walking in a park. No one in Nashville is interested in this.

Anyways, we have an opportunity to move to Missoula. My work is there. We have money for a home in the area. She loves hiking and I am obsessed with fly fishing and rivers. I visited and fell in love. She is used to harsh Winters from Ukraine and I don't mind them. We plan on visiting together this Summer.

My biggest fear is that she has the same issues in Missoula as Nashville. No one is interested in being friends. They are put off by her accent and don't want to spend time getting to know her.

1idonts,https://www.reddit.com/r/LastWarMobileGame/comments/1idonts/delete_the_game_asap/,DELETE THE GAME ASAP,"I haven’t played a game since Clash of Clans in 2016. Last year, due to extremely bad circumstances, I had to move out and live in a remote village, far away from everything. At the time, I didn’t know how long I would be staying there, as I was waiting for things to cool down. I had nothing to do.

One day, out of sheer boredom, I decided to download this game I kept seeing in YouTube ads. That day, I played for four hours and got hooked instantly. I kept it up for the next two days, digging into the mechanics, browsing Discord and Reddit, and getting deeply involved in the game. That was the moment I realized I was getting addicted.

So I deleted it immediately. This has been my practice since I was a teenager—if I feel like I’m becoming addicted to something, I stop right away before it’s too late. I’ve learned that if I don’t stop early, I’ll end up quitting much later, after wasting years.

The next day, though, I was bored out of my mind. I slipped up and said, Screw it. Let me get addicted.

I reinstalled the game and dove in. I learned every trick in the book, mastered every combination, joined the best alliances, and stayed in the top 50 on my server for months. But the whole time, I knew I’d have to quit someday. I knew all the time and money I was pouring into it would amount to absolutely nothing. Yet I just couldn’t stop. No matter how hard I tried, I couldn’t bring myself to delete it again.

Then one week, I was about to max out my first squad to five stars. I had 450 recruitment cards saved, patiently waiting for the hero event to use everything. The anticipation was boiling—I was addicted to the dopamine rush. This game was like cocaine for rats. It manipulates your dopamine, and once you’re hooked, you’re trapped. We all know it, and yet we keep playing.

But then, on the big day, as I prepared to sync my upgrades during the Arms Race, I had a thought: This is the highest dose of dopamine this game can give me. If I can tell this game “F** you” right now, I can tell it “F*** you” forever.*

So I didn’t upgrade anything. Instead, I said goodbye to my alliance, donated all my resources, and within one minute of making the decision, I deleted the game from my phone.

The next few days were strange. On the first day, I was fine. But the second day, I woke up and felt like I’d lost something important. Even though the game was meaningless and harmful, it still left a void.

I made myself a cup of coffee, walked into the woods, and sat under a tree to drink it in peace. I swear it felt like a prisoner being released from their cell. I didn’t have to deal with the daily “chores” of the game anymore. I didn’t have to spend money or worry about in-game tasks. And when I thought about the game, I realized it wasn’t even “fun.” It was just a to-do list disguised as entertainment—chores I was imposing on myself.

And I wasn’t getting paid for it. I was paying them! That’s some dark magic right there. 😂

Honestly, I hadn’t planned to write this post. I deleted the game over a month ago and had mostly forgotten about it. But today, I was checking my Reddit inbox and saw someone reply to an old comment I made on this subreddit. I clicked on the subreddit and saw posts from people asking how to get stronger and unlock better heroes. It made me sad. I felt like I had to share this, just in case someone really wants to quit but can’t take that first step.

For the record, I have nothing against games. They’re an amazing way to stimulate the brain, and I think gaming for a few hours a week can be really healthy. But giving your time and money to an app that uses manipulation as its primary business model is a huge problem for me—especially when it targets kids. In my opinion, that’s unethical. I’m all in on boycotting apps like these.

Profile: NMAT: 247 | 9/9/9 | BBA | 18 months workex 


Considering the fact that I had been very anxious about the entire GDPI process during prep, the NMIMS process was a cakewalk. I didn't feel nervous or jittery for even a minute.


So when I reached, we were made to sit in a VIP lounge. There is an open area outside the lounge for parents to sit. Didn't really like the arrangement this time around. I had given this interview in 2022 as well and it felt much smoother back then.


So everyone submitted their bags and phones in the VIP lounge. We were then divided into groups of 8-10 people each. There were a lot of no shows in my group; only 4 people showed up so my interview process was quick. I was the first one to go in. Then we were moved onto the auditorium where they played the same fire safety video on loop for eternity until you're sure you'll remember the fire safety manager's name for the rest of your life 💀 this part was torturous considering I had to get up at 3AM to travel and was already kind of drowsy.


Then around 2:30, we proceeded for the competency assessment. It started at 2:45 sharp. A pretty straightforward test with some unnecessary twists imo. The test was for 45 minutes but I finished it within 25-30 minutes and didn't know what to do for the rest of the time so started doodling on the rough sheets lmao


1. Verbal Ability - the same paragraph summaries, para completion, a small RC, an antonym question


2. Mental Ability - one arrangement set (very straightforward), and assertion reasoning based questions.


3. Managerial Ability - now this section didn't make sense to me. Even though I'm a BBA graduate, they went a bit too deep into the subjects. They asked to calculate jensen's alpha value from the given values for a mutual fund. And another question from principles of management that was like a fill in the blank right from a textbook that no one could answer unless they have read the exact same textbook. The decision making questions were doable. I only left 3 questions unattempted overall and all 3 from this section.


After this, they made us sit in an open area on the 7th floor which looked more like a fire refuge area. Provided us with potato patties, tea/coffee and started calling people for interviews using our NMAT IDs. It kind of felt like a fish market at that time. Management level was 0 and people were barely able to hear their IDs amongst the noise of the fan and all the chit chatting.


Anyway, we proceeded in groups of 2-3 to the cabins. Two people were made to sit outside and one person was sent inside. I was the first and for some reason there wasn't even a tinge of nervousness in me. I entered and there was 1 male panelist in his 40s. The first thing i said was ""good morning sir"" 🤦🏻‍♀️ instantly realized my mistake but it was too late and he corrected me and said ""good afternoon"" but he had a smile so it was fine. (I made this exact same mistake 2 years ago for NMIMS. Said good morning instead of good afternoon to the panelists smh). There was a laptop in front of him facing me and he asked me to just speak out the answers and not worry about any spelling or grammatical mistakes that the ai was making. He said he would take care of it. He gave a couple of other instructions and then I was ready to begin.


The first question itself made me realize that my SOP was already in the system because it generated  a few questions accordingly. Mentioning a few questions below:


1. How has your stellar academic performance and your work experience in a reputed firm made you passionate about your domain?


2. How has the global economic situation affected consulting firms?
(Spoke a little about Trump)


3. Moving on to a different topic, tell me some recent news unrelated to finance or economics.
(Spoke about the stampede at Mahakumbh)


4. If you were to lead the event, what policies or procedures would you implement to ensure people's safety


5. What has the indian government done to support entrepreneurial ventures


6. Are you interested in any sports? Can you talk about any recent developments of any sport?
(I'm not interested and don't keep up with sports so said so and the ai moved on)


7. What subject was the most challenging for you during your undergraduate? How did you face it?


The interview ended with this. The panelist was smiling throughout and that helped me stay calm. I received no questions from him after my ai interview. He thanked me and said I was done and could leave the venue.


Overall, it felt like a cakewalk and other interviews would definitely not be so easy i guess. The AI interview made it very simple imo. The entire process took me 2.5 hours because I was the first one to be interviewed. Would have taken longer for others. I enjoyed the experience as it wasn't grilling or anxiety-inducing at any moment :)


P.S. writing this from the airport after a very tiring day so excuse any grammatical/spelling mistakes 😭

I was overwhelmed and lost in my endeavors from the pre planning and packing to the moment I arrived. I just only wish I had known about Move On Relocation before moving. The full name of the company is **Move On Relocation - International Relocation services for USA & UK Expats moving to Portugal**. You can google that and it will take you to the website.

I was lucky enough to have met the founder of the company Angela Pereira at a entrepreneurs event in Porto. She was my saving grace, it was there in a local coffee shop she took my hand and told me that everything was going to be okay. She set up a ""to do"" kind of ""importance task list"" for us to accomplish together. I can only say good things about this company and tell everyone if you are moving to Portugal soon you need Angela. She is more vital than the luggage you decide to pack with you. I only wish I would have known about her services and business sooner and I would have not been so stressed out from the beginning. 

  
Services include: 

* Obtaining visa
* Finding accommodation (buying or renting)
* Schools’ transfer/enrolement if applicable
* Insurances for the household including pets if applicable
* Legal support for diverse issues related with the relocation process
* Accounting support for taxes related issues (Applying for the NHR/IFICI tax regime, annual tax return, etc)
* National health system incorporation (SNS)
* Drivers permit exchange for non-EU
* Opening a Bank account
* Setting up utilities and Home Communication
* Welcome information pack with key considerations when living in Portugal 

With a bunch more other services that you can find on the website. Aside from all the services she offers, you really get a genuine person who cares about your experiences and wants to make your life easier. Think to yourself, **why do we decide to relocate anyway?** Probably because you are hoping for a better life, a better job, or maybe even for you children to have more opportunity. Maybe you're like me and you fell in love with the bliss of the Portuguese lifestyle. In any case, once you make that decision to relocate, you don't want to be weighed down by all the stress that relocating causes as soon as you make the decision to improve your life. This is why Move On Relocation is the best thing to know about before moving to Portugal. For me, discovering Move On Relocation was more valuable than finding gold.

First, I want to thank everyone who responded! 🙏 Some even ordered coffee from me, which I truly appreciate. ♥️

However, I couldn’t find all the answers to my questions. So, I’m making this post to help those who have doubts about opening their own coffee business. Maybe this will also bring feedback from others in the same field, so I can learn and improve.

How It Started

I’ve always struggled to find coffee that truly makes me feel at home. Coming from Italy and living in Belgium, I realized that the coffee culture here is different from what I grew up with. It’s not that local brands do a bad job—far from it—but they simply don’t match my personal taste.

There’s a common misconception about Italian coffee: people think it’s overly roasted, too dark, and too bitter. But that’s not the full story. Often, this comes from industrial roasting, poor-quality beans, or baristas who don’t handle coffee properly.

In reality, Italian coffee can be a rich, flavorful, and balanced experience—just like wine. It’s all about finding the right coffee for your palate. Since taste is personal, I wanted to create a space where people could explore and find what truly suits them.

That’s why I decided to open my own Italian-style coffee shop—a bottega, where people could not only grab a great espresso but also get advice on what coffee to use at home based on their preferences.

The First Steps

The idea came to me in early 2018, after a trip to Florence, where I discovered an incredible blend made by a coffee master in Borgo San Lorenzo: Caffè Grand Angolo. That experience made me realize I wanted to bring a piece of Italy with me—something that could “cure” my homesickness.

I started visiting multiple roasters, selecting suppliers, and selling coffee the old-fashioned way—going door to door and introducing people to the flavors I loved. Once I saw that customers were happy, I started planning to open a small shop part-time while keeping my full-time job.

➡️ I started with Mokarico, the roaster I discovered in Tuscany. They do an amazing job, and their passion for coffee is contagious.
➡️ My mother has friends in Naples who swear by Lollo Caffè, a brand even used by one of Italy’s most famous chefs, Antonino Cannavacciuolo.

I visited both, and they trusted me. I placed small orders, but they liked my enthusiasm about “making espresso great again.”

But by early 2019, as I was getting deeper into the planning phase… well, we all know what happened next. The pandemic forced me to rethink everything.

For some background: A few years ago I raped someone (NOT CHILD RELATED), and have taken full responsibility for what I did. I make no excuses - what I did was horrible. I plead early and did 4-years in prison (am still on parole), where I spent most of my time reading, working on math problems and reflecting on how & why my life started going downhill to the point of raping someone. I will be permanently registered as a sex offender (no qualms) and my conviction will never be spent (top > 5 years).

My background is in finance/data science, I have a postgraduate degree in mathematics and had 2 years of experience before going to prison. For the past 9 months, I have been applying to related and adjacent jobs (any tech job really) for 3 hours a day, everyday, and have gotten nowhere. 

I have been getting plenty of interviews and have been disclosing my offense. Half the time I get the ""wrong fit"" response and the other half of rejections are just better candidates. Even for roles that are fully-remote, this is still an issue. I have also been looking for contract positions, but I don't come across those very often. 

I have reached out to my previous workmates who tell me they have no issue working with me, but still have to go through my ex-employer's official hiring channel (which have already rejected me). 

In the meantime, I work FT in a restaurant, day-trade (successfully, but this can't be scaled to a FT salary due to the type of asset I trade) and keep up my technical skills on the weekend. This keeps the lights on, but everyday it feels like I am wasting my technical skills and it destroys my mental health.

I have been slowly trying to recalibrate my expectation's on life, but damn; corporate australia is so pretentious and make it impossible to slowly reintegrate back into society. I am working in a kitchen now, around women, no background check required and no one causes a fuss (and I think some staff are aware of my history as I haven't changed my name).

I could get a job at some retailers, work in nightclubs, bars, coffee shops and my employer either wouldn't care or check. But as soon as the job is in an office, suddenly it's an issue. Am I just doomed to never have an office job where I can be left alone to work and solve problems? (I can't work that requires heavy lifting as I have a herniated disc - this current restaurant job is my limit for pain tolerance). 

What is the point of saying our prison system is to rehabilitate where a lot of life won't go back to normal? If I knew it was going to be this hard to find a role, I probably wouldn't have even applied for parole... 


PS: If anyone is hiring for a tech role and willing to give an ex-inmate a 2nd chance, my dm's are open.

Technical skills are:
- CPP (stl, boost and threading)
- Python
- mathematics/stats
- derivatives pricing

They have a Sip club membership that normally $14.99 a month but is currently going on for $3 with their current promotion. Pretty much you can get a cup of coffee cheaper than what a keurig costs to make a cup.

If you go there 7 times a day, you are only paying 1.4 cents a cup at the promotional price or 7.1 cents a cup at the normal membership price. Though I am still wondering why the chai tea is not one of the beverages allowed, since it doesn't state anywhere in the terms  “latte” or “espresso bar” items are excluded, though it says ice and hot teas are.

It also offers unlimited refills while you stay in their warm cozy building working on projects or just want to get out of the cold and stay warm. it doesn't require credit card and you can use gift cards to pay for the membership.

membership and promotional break down, even though there page break down is off 4 drinks. 
$14.99 / 7 / 30 = 0.071 cents a cup
$3 / 7 / 30 = 0.014 cents a cup

This makes me wonder how much each beverage actually costs to make and where they are recovering money from it. Minimum wage in Illinois is $15 an hour, that is $0.25 cents a minute. So each cup of beverage cost $0.50 plus the overhead for running the place. 

Also i wondered how many ways this could be broken, using just gift cards allow anyone to create multiple accounts and purchases at a single time. Even though you gotta deal with signing into a new account for each one and can use the same phone number on each account,  but need a different email address.

Pass it around and let everyone know!

1idoanw,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1idoanw/help_me_buy_my_first_grinder/,Help me buy my first grinder,"Hi all, I love coffee and want to dive deeper into the hobby. I want to get into espresso in the long run but that seems quite expensive and I decided to step into pour-over first, also to explore the different flavours of specialty coffee beans from around the world! Now all I need is a grinder... 

I had my eyes on the timemore 064S or 078S, since it's great for espresso and it's filter-capable. But after some review, it seemed to me the filter from a filter-only grinder, like the Ode gen 2, is significantly better, but that's an additional expense. Now I'm torn between getting an espresso+filter grinder that will be future-proof for when I invest in espresso but will give me perhaps mediocre filter coffee now, and buying an ode gen 2 now to have very good filter, and worry about espresso and additional costs later. 

What would you suggest? Is the ode gen 2 filter that much better than a timemore 078S? Or would I hardly notice the difference? ",1,1738247674.0,pourover,3,0.67,False

Smart home kitchen gadgets are revolutionizing the way we cook and prepare meals, making the kitchen more efficient, functional, and enjoyable. As technology continues to advance, these innovative devices enhance convenience and streamline cooking processes. From preparation to cooking to cleanup, smart gadgets are making everyday tasks easier and more precise.

One of the standout innovations in smart kitchens is the smart oven. Equipped with Wi-Fi connectivity and voice control, these ovens allow you to preheat or adjust cooking settings from your smartphone or through virtual assistants. This ensures perfectly cooked meals with minimal effort. Additionally, many smart ovens come with built-in cameras that allow you to monitor your food without opening the door, conserving energy and reducing cooking times.

Smart kitchen scales are another essential gadget that offers precision and convenience. These scales connect to apps that guide you through recipes, providing measurements in real-time, ensuring accurate portions and reducing waste. The ability to track nutritional information directly from the scale enhances the cooking experience while promoting healthy habits.

For those who enjoy coffee, a smart coffee maker offers programmable features that can brew your favorite cup at the perfect time. With mobile apps, you can customize brew strength and even schedule brewing times to wake up to that invigorating aroma each morning. Some models even allow for voice commands, integrating seamlessly with your smart home system.

In addition to cooking gadgets, smart kitchen assistance devices are making meal prep easier. From smart refrigerators that track inventory and suggest recipes based on ingredients to smart dishwashers that optimize washing cycles according to load, the benefits are numerous. These gadgets not only save time but also help reduce food waste and energy consumption.

As the trend of smart home kitchen gadgets continues to grow, integrating them into your cooking routine leads to a more efficient culinary experience. The combination of technology and cooking not only enhances meal preparation but also inspires creativity and experimentation in the kitchen.

In the last 18-24 months, I’ve been hella annoyed by Lindsie and am getting my Kail fix on Karma & Chaos and Barely Famous. I kept TST in my rotation out of habit.

1ido2xz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ido2xz/long_unjustified_silent_treatment_is_so/,[LONG] Unjustified silent treatment is so traumatising and damaging,"I (33F) have a close male friend (46M) that I met through work and work closely with before we became good friends outside of work too. We’ve had a close relationship with each other more or less the whole time that we’ve been more than just colleagues/acquaintances, and I picked up early on that he is quite a complex guy, to say the least. He has some neurological health issues that impact his mental health, and I noticed that he can be quite a flakey person, but he never seemed to be like this maliciously, I kind of just accepted that as frustrating as it can be sometimes, his actions don’t match what he says and he tends to bail out of plans more often than not. I feel as though things with him definitely ebbed and flowed in the sense that some weeks, he was a lot happier around me, was more eager to hang out/spend time together both in and out of work, and would make plans for us to do stuff over the weekend and stick to it. Other weeks, he’d be in a terrible mood and would even ignore me some days, and I found it difficult and upsetting to navigate, especially as it often seemed to come off the back of us spending time together and having such a lovely time, and feeling very close to one another. Him ignoring me was never really addressed, he’d just pop up again after a day/few days/a week or even weeks on occasions and act like nothing had happened, or earlier on in the friendship, I would just approach him and speak to him as normal and he’d snap out of it sooner or later. If I got fed up with his behaviour and ever reciprocated him ignoring me, if he were in a good mood he would appear to panic and come find me to ask if I was/thing were okay, or he would go silent and start ignoring me whenever he thought he had upset me. I had a little pop at him once for letting someone at work eat a chocolate bar that I bought for him and his initial reaction was to ignore me after I expressed to him that I found it not very nice to give away something I bought for him right in front of me.

I think there has been slight blurred lines between us at times, and there has definitely been heavy flirting (he isn’t affectionate at all and is noticeably uncomfortable when his friends are affectionate with him, but often times he’s touched my leg/arm when talking to me, when I’ve genuinely complimented him and you can see he is overwhelmed/touched, he blushes a lot and has stroked my face, quite a few nights now we’ve been out drinking after work and we always sit next to or opposite each other, and our legs always end up touching and we never move away, once he actually jammed his entire leg in between mine and it stayed there for a long time. I often hold his arm when we’re walking around together too and sometimes he squeezes my hand with his arm when I do so. I’ve also noticed that when we’re out together, even with friends, he stares at me constantly and looks away when I look at him back, and then always goes back to staring at me again) - it’s small things that could clearly mean something more, but not enough to be definitive… it always feels like there’s tension between us and an elephant in the room, but in a good way. He is a notoriously private and independent man and has divulged very personal things about himself to me that I know he has told very few others, even some close friends of his. 

We would often semi-regularly do stuff together outside of work and pretty regularly keep in contact over text, both during and outside of work. One strange factor in all of this is another woman at our workplace that he has been good friends with for years now, and who made him godfather to her son… I’d say he and I had a closer relationship with each other than he had with this woman at the time, but she went out of her way to befriend me early spring last year after she told me that this guy speaks about me to her often and always tells her when we’ve done stuff together outside of work etc, and she made a point of telling me that he is very fond of me and from the offset, told me she teased him about us going on dates together when we hang out and made it clear she thought we should be together. She suddenly regularly began summoning me to “catch up” with her during work over a coffee at least once a week, but this quickly turned into being interrogated about my every move and interaction with this man, and I noticed she would be quite cruel towards me if I mentioned something trivial about this guy that she didn’t know herself, or if I talked about us spending time together and we had such a nice time together, she would then get visibly annoyed and would either insult him physically or his personality, tell me that he has a type (beautiful, slender, successful careers/wealthy) and I make it clear that I’m not it, or further down the line, she started trying to get me to do/say stuff to him that would’ve 100% sabotaged my relationship with him, and caused us both humiliation in the process. This woman is closer to his age and doesn’t have any female friends, she is only friends with men and generally, wealthy/powerful men (this guy is very wealthy and comes from a wealthy family too, I was unaware of this until I’d been friends with him for some time and until he invited me to his home for the first time months into our friendship). She often spoke of my appearance and would always touch my hair and tell me how beautiful I am, but I noticed she would behave in a way that seemed fake or even sinister at times (I’d say I’m quite attractive, I get complimented often and I do receive quite a bit of attention from men - I’m rather tall too, and this woman is slim but not attractive at all and it always felt sinister when she complimented me and touched me often), I have struggled with my weight for a while and recently lost 45kg, I still have a little more that I want to lose, but she would get really funny when I talked about wanting to lose more weight and would tell me I didn’t need to and I shouldn’t, but her being slim compared to me, always spoke about how “fat” she was and she wanted surgery etc. all in all, I realised quickly that she had befriended me under false pretences, and I’d ignored warnings from several trusted colleagues-turned close friends about keeping away from her and not trusting her. I started keeping my distance from her after she attempted to force me to gatecrash this guy doing a teaching seminar at a renowned professional institution that he took time off work to attend and speak at, and that same week, he became unwell with his neurological issues and ended up being off work sick a further few weeks after this. 

It was late last summer that he came back and he was like a different person, still the same, but was being so kind and sweet, exactly how I’d hope he’d be towards me all of the time. He was making excuses to come and see me at my desk all of the time, he took me out of work early one day this same week to go to some romantic, cosy wine bars and it was just so comfortably intimate and lovely. He asked to take a picture of us together, he ordered drinks that he wanted me to try and we did our usual swapping and trying each others, he took his glasses off when I said he had something in his eyebrow and let me brush it out of the way… I felt like I was on a date with him. He had to go for neurological tests that same week too, and came to me before and asked if I could remove all of the sticky stuff off his scalp if the staff didn’t do it before he left, I said of course I would and he came straight to me afterwards, but he didn’t have anything on his scalp that needed removing, but he was all giggly and silly and asked me to stroke his “luscious locks” to make sure that he was all clear, and grabbed my hand to touch his head all over in the middle of our workplace office, which was humorous but also felt a little risky to be this flirty and silly so openly at work. That same weekend, he kept asking me to spend Sunday morning with him going to a flower market and grabbing coffee and breakfast after, and even told me that his mother was down for that weekend and it was her birthday on that Sunday, and I was kind of surprised that he left his mother in his home alone on her birthday for the morning because he really wanted to spend the morning with me… he wore brand new shoes that morning and blushed when I asked if they were new. The next week at work, I felt like I was on a bit of a high and feeling happy, and I was met with a wall of silence from him. No explanation, no reason, just in a bad mood and he refused to look at/talk to me. A couple of weeks later when he was still being a bit funny, I bought him something really funny that was a bit of an inside joke with us and he was over the moon, cackling in the middle of office at work and told me it’s the best present he’s ever had. I mentioned in passing that I wanted to try a certain flavour of tea but I could never find a good one, and a day or two later, I had a message from him to say that he had gone to a specialist tea shop on the other side of the city, almost an hour away from where he lived, just to buy me this flavour tea that I mentioned wanting, and I thought it was so sweet of him, and then it all seemed to go very quickly downhill. 

Fast forward to the first week of September, I hadn’t seen this woman friend of his for about a month or so now, not since she tried to physically pull me out of a chair to take me to gatecrash this guy’s teaching seminar elsewhere, and she suddenly summoned me for a “catch up”. Before I even sat myself down into the chair, she asked me if I’d seen this guy/spoke to him/done anything with him recently, and I lied to her and told her that we didn’t really have much to do with each other anymore and we didn’t have much of a relationship anymore — nothing had happened per se, just that he was being his usual grumpy self and I decided to step back (not a complete lie at this point), and she was absolutely thrilled… I’ve never seen someone look so smug before, and she even said to me “good”… when I questioned why it was good, she said “oh, I just think it’s for the best” and proceeded to spend the next hour incessantly bragging about how since he had his neurological episode a month prior, she had used that to get very, very close to him and they were now glued to the hip and “closer than we’ve ever been”. She told me about how she checks in with him every weekend, she never has to wait for him to text her back, if she worries about him too much over the weekends he’ll sometimes call her, and to my horror, said she even asked him to put her in contact with his elderly mother who is a carer to his father and who has poor mobility herself, but who also lives 5 hours away from him, just in case she can’t contact him and is worried about him… she said he told her no (thank god), but put her in contact with his best friend who also lives in the building next to him, so she can contact him instead, and she was so thrilled about this because she said that she really dislikes this friend/neighbour of his because “he has far too much influence over him and this way, I can keep a closer eye on things” and I just sat there, taking all of this in in quiet and shocked horror, and it really hit me then that this deranged woman had spent the best part of a year befriending me under entirely false pretences with the likely goal of sabotaging or at least putting a wedge between me and this guy, and used him having a neurological event that could’ve killed him to finally get herself as close to him as possible. This woman, who put her entire life and even her own infant child on the back burner to be at his beck and call. I feel horrified and hurt, but also so confused and ashamed to have been at the centre of something so childish and ridiculous. I should also say, this guy categorically has no romantic interest in this woman at all and they are not romantically involved. 

I previously lost it with him a bit a few weeks later for ignoring me for no reason and he was so visibly uncomfortable when I confronted him and initially he told me I was being childish, then when I pulled him away to speak away from people he tried to lighten the mood by constantly joking when I was trying to have a serious conversation with him about how hurtful I found it when he ignores me for no reason, and it’s cruel to do so… he just switched between visibly uncomfortable and trying to joke around about things, but kept telling me that it wasn’t personal and it was just him. We bumped into each other throughout the day and he tried to be all flirty and silly and kept apologising, and later in the evening he messaged me and said he felt really bad and he genuinely was sorry, and said let’s go for drinks soon or spend a Sunday morning together again soon and kept texting me over and over, I could tell he probably did feel bad, but to this day, I haven’t seen him outside of work since, just distancing himself from me more and more. He barely acknowledged a big birthday I had in November, and this woman put a birthday card for me on my desk that read “wishing you peace of mind and all the happiness you can get. Happy birthday.” which both confused and concerned me. I was off with pneumonia for 3 weeks and he messaged me only a couple of times after 2 weeks commenting that he hadn’t seen me around for a bit and was I okay, but never responded to me when I answered, and then just asked if I was okay again a week later, and then nothing when I responded again. We caught up over coffee briefly just before Christmas and he bailed out of plans we had with another friend for pre-Xmas drinks, but said we’d do something over the holidays as he had time off, so I messaged him back and told him what dates I was busy, but said I’d leave it up to him to reach out to me when he was free to get together, and I’ve never heard from him since. No Happy Christmas or Happy New Year messages, nothing. We came back to work after the holidays and he was noticeably miserable, he tried to say hello and I was cold and clipped, but said hi back, and essentially, he has completely ignored me ever since, and it’s unbearable. Interestingly, he has been ignoring almost everyone else too and has been mostly isolating himself from everyone in the workplace, even his close woman friend, but only for a week, which sent her into a spiral and led to her questioning another good friend of his about if they knew what was going on with him and said over again ”you would tell me if you knew something about him that I don’t, wouldn’t you? You wouldn’t keep anything from me, would you?” which has raised alarm bells in this other friend, naturally. But mostly, he seems to have been using this awful woman as an emotional crutch at work.

I don’t exactly know what advice I’m seeking and I don’t think there is anything that anyone can help me with. I just feel heartbroken, completely fooled and like an idiot. I’m also confused, even though some things are very clear to me, and I’m shocked at how torturous all of this feels, and I’ve come to realise it’s the unjustifiable silent treatment that I’m receiving for a prolonged period of time. Am I right to just keep my distance and stay away from him and this woman at work too?

I not unintelligent, and keep going over everything and cursing myself for not seeing warning signs sooner. I also can’t believe that two adults, over a decade older than I am, are capable of behaving so childishly and petulantly— I wouldn’t expect this behaviour from teenagers at school. I suppose I don’t really feel as though I can speak to anyone about this because I find it all so bizarre, and I’m really struggling with the fact that I have to see these people multiple times a week, and it’s really impacting me mentally. My anxiety has rocketed and I’m not sleeping well at all. I miss my guy friend terribly and I don’t understand his behaviour. I think there was also the slow-burn, romantic hopefulness of something more that I had too, which is adding to the hurt. 

He drinks heavily over the weekends sometimes when he is alone at home, and has previously made passing comments about how he does it so he “can face the person he is in the mirror.” He hasn’t had a long term relationship in about a decade now, never been married or had children, and only seems to casually date women for short periods of time before cutting it off, as commented on by his best friend/neighbour. He has always fallen into the pattern of avoiding and ignoring me, especially after we’ve had lovely times together and have seemed closer than ever, but this time it’s going on and on and I don’t think it will end, and I don’t think I will ever forgive him for this. 

It makes me so sad that he’s sabotaged such a lovely relationship between us, for what? Because he’s so avoidant? Because he generally can’t cope with any kind of closeness with someone? Do avoidants like him inflict the silent treatment out of guilt? I think all I can do now is remove myself from the office as much as possible until I can find a new job (easier said than done), but I do feel heartbroken, and I feel stupid.",1,1738247062.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

1idnyea,https://www.reddit.com/r/ManyBaggers/comments/1idnyea/my_ltt_bag_review_after_a_week/,My LTT Bag Review after a week,"[Exterior Bag View](https://preview.redd.it/wgsb75kyz4ge1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a5ed4966303cf32a4e08e31cec551d694418e5a0)

So my journey started when my Timbuk2 Authority backpack after many years straps started failing.  Around the fall I started a new bag search in earnest.  I have had a few but this past week I been using the LTT Commuter Backpack and givne how new it is and how peopel may still be on the fence or waiting on shipment I would write my thoughts on it.

Pros: 

* For a 20L bag this feels big.  I have a Black Ember 25 and that thing looks great but it does not feel like a 25L bag.  I also have a Urban Assault and because of its layout also does not feel like a 24L bag.  This at least feels the size it says.
* It feels like it will be durable.  It has metal strap adjusters, PU Coated zippers (which I know is a long term problem for future me) and the double bottom and double hand rivets screams that this thing will not rip prematurely.  Not that I have had a bag do that but it at least feels the part
* I love the admin pouch layout.  The sleeves, pouches, and spots to put things all make sense logically and the stretchy fabric parts do their job well.  I can see not using tech pouches with this thing if you don't really want to.  I especially like the little stash pouch at the bottom of the compartment.
* I like the bright material inside.  My biggest pet peeve of the Authority I had was it had a black interior which meant I couldn't see into it well which is a problem if the bag does not fully open clamshell style.
* I love how this stands.  I never had a bag that self stands and I love it now for it.
* Strap holders.  Every bag needs them I had sucked up too many bag straps with vacuums TYVM
* Love the sunglasses holders.  As a recent lasik patient I have been getting into sunglasses and I love it has a pouch that feels safe enough for my to put my glasses in.  It doesn't feel like it will be crushed by an oversized item and it is softly lined.  Perfect for sunglasses.
* Water bottle holders.  I carry an Owala Bottle with me as you can see and in the evening I will put my Coffee Yeti rambler into the other one.  I don't need two holders but I like them.
* Tons of hidden compartments to stash stuff in and I love it.  great for going through security checkpoints I put my pocket items into them and then I don't need to worry about throwing them in the main compartment to bounce around

Cons:

* Harness system is not the most comfortable.  it feels...like narrow I guess?  I don't know how to describe it but I get strap fatigue even just going from my car to my office.  It is even so slight and I am very sensitive to these things usually but be aware its likely not the most comfortable straps in the world but they are not that terrible.
* The admin compartment is laid out nicely but...it bulges if you look at it funny. If you look at some of my photos below you can see a slight curve.  If you put anything in the tech compartment this happens.  My answer was to fill the admin slots up first then fill the tech compartment but then I am nervous about shoving my kindle into it because I am not sure how well it will slide back in (I carry my kindle far more then I read it sadly)
* The zippers feel small and cheap.  I know they are YKK and I know they are PU coated but everything in this bag screams about a durable design for normal wear and tear and then we get tiny zippers.  Still the pull tabs work great and most of the time I have no issues but yeah...just a nit pick
* The gusseted tech compartment will sometime catch the zipper
* Speaking of the tech compartment its not an issue for me but for others it will not easily fit a 16"" MBP it will push against the zippers.  They are already removing it from the description and have been active in the community to address it.  Just be aware take the dimensions they list and assume a .25-.5"" smaller dimension if you are trying to see if it will fit your laptop.  I have a 14"" MBP so this is not an issue and it seems to be a height thing.  Still be aware.
* Materials they use a recycled plastic canvas.  great for the environment but I am not sure how durable or water resistant it will be. I guess I will find out eventually but yeah  this isn't XPac or even codura.  And it attracts pet hair like you would expect.

So overall what are my feelings?

I like it for the price I paid (I got it in the early release discount phase) it is one of the cheapest bags I have purchased during my search.  The layout makes sense for my needs and I can fit my steam deck into it with room to spare.  Its well built and functions well.  My cons may or may not be deal breakers for you.  That is pretty subjective.  But I like it and if you can get it on a Black Friday or Lime Day sale (if they do that) I think its worth it.  I will still probably continue my search but so far this is appealing to me even more then my Black Ember Citadel 25 does (Which is too flat for my needs but otherwise a great bag). I will continue to flip around bags and see what i prefer.

I have been into espresso making for about two months now and although I keep getting better shots, some things happen which I find hard to find the cause of.

I attached a video where you can see that before the nice bright coffee colors, an liquidy dark colored coffee comes out. I know that start of extraction is meant to be darker but this doesnt look good. Underneath are my variables. I am using supermarket fairtrade coffee of 2 months old. This is far from specialty but I want to get the workflow right first before I buy more expensive coffee. On top of that, I have seen this guy [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0jlkeY\_zsA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0jlkeY_zsA) dial in amazon  coffee to get an amazing shot.

Is this dark stuff just the result of cheap coffee or could this be workflow related as well?

PS. I know my steamwand and coffee machine are dirty in this vid but you have to realize this is my 5th consecutive shot hahaha

1idnwo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1idnwo9/loss_of_appetite/,loss of appetite,"I’ve been on m2tone, hyponnid and birth control for a month now 

I’m slowly losing my appetite. Not in a good way. I didn’t eat a lot usually, but now I can barely stomach eating. I easily skip meals as much as I can until I get a headache. I don’t know what’s happening, but I know this shouldn’t be normal. 

It takes me 2 hours to finish my coffee and one muffin. I don’t know what’s wrong with me. Is this normal when taking these medications? 
I got my period after a long time and even then I didn’t have any cravings. I think I crave sugar but when I have something sugary I lose all interest. I’ve lost interest in eating anything at all. 

Who should I consult in this case? And has this happened to any of y’all? ",1,1738246555.0,PCOS,1,1.0,False

1idnvg4,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1idnvg4/honestly_i_dont_think_cold_approach_is_for/,"Honestly, I don’t think cold approach is for everyone","I had dove way too deep on this cold approach pickup artist stuff on YouTube who make it seem like this stuff is like super appreciated and well received by women. I don’t know if it’s the fact that I was on a college campus with 19-21 year olds, and as a 24 year old guy it comes off weird, but like this stuff was not well received.


I did like three cold approaches, and it usually started it off with me asking them about what they were working on or what they thought of the shoes they were wearing (if in the gym), and while some women were open to chatting the instant our 2-3 min of small talk ended and I asked if she wanted to grab coffee, there was instant rejection, like “sorry I have a boyfriend” to “oh no I’m flattered but thank you”. 

Also, like I’m on a COLLEGE campus. So someone may read this and go “3 approaches isn’t anything, you need to spam it and do like 100s”. Well at some point you know, I don’t want to like, get reported to the dean for harassment? Become the campus pickup artist? I’m a student there after all.

Idk I just don’t think this cold approach stuff is for me. After like 3 times of doing so and it feeling so awkward because I barely knew the person, idk if I should continue doing this. ",0,1738246455.0,dating_advice,3,0.5,False
