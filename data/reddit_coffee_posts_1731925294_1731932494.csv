I recently did a coffe tasting/cupping with a nice Ethiopian coffee. This was just coffee in water, and it had a wonderful, smooth, body. Kind of reminded me of the mouthfeel of a pastry sour beer? 

However in our Hario Switch, that whole ""body"" feel completely disappeared (I suppose because of the paper filter and coffee oils..?). 

I'm now on the lookout for an at home brewing method that will retain it. I'm not a fan of coffee grounds in my coffee and like drinking it quite hot and in large volumes. So the questions are 
- Does the French Press mesh filter leave those oils in? 
-  Is there another method I could try, that separates the grounds, but leaves the body intact?

Set the scene a bit, I have 4 kids pregnant with no 5 (due in 2 months) oldest 2 with ex and younger 3 with current 'partner'. I'm 35 and suffer physically and mentally (think fibromyalgia, anxiety depression agoraphobia..) only past relationship was long term and full of abuse with a narcasist. Recently moved to a different rental after 5 yrs in a mouldy rental. A lot more expensive but bigger and healthier although it does mean I have to drive several times a day for school run (mental health doesn't like driving). Been here 8 months and in that 8 months partner done nothing to improve house, everything is my job, all kid related tasks, all house related tasks, everything, owns a ferret (uk so not desexed or descented and stinks!) that lives in the house....doesn't ever clean it, should be every 3 days smell wise, Iv asked him to do it every week because I'm struggling to get up and down with the belly in the way...in the 3 ish years we've had it he's cleaned it maybe 5 times...my job apparently, we have a dog that pretty much lives in his cage never gets walked and is put into a run on concrete when outside to shit, cleaning his shit up is apparently my job, I can't even get down to my feet most days but shoveling piles of dog shit and hosing down the concrete is my job.....keeping the grass cut through summer so kids could play outside? My job....big garden takes hours and hours and hours in blistering sun while pregnant...still my job, emptying all inside bins? My job apparently but If I bitch and moan enough he will carry them to the curb for me....I left some out of date food in fridge, food bin was full decided to bin it once food bin was empty as should have been 2 days later...just kept adding to the pile in fridge because had nowhere else to put it but he kept not putting bin out so bin always full eventualy 2 months later bin was emptied and I emptied the fridge...his response was he would have just black bagged the lot...but he hadn't, he left it for me, and if it had been black bagged it would have been ripped all over the garden by wildlife for me to deal with...there's currently rotting pumpkin all over the step by back door where he bagged them to compost and then left them there...they been there about 2 weeks now just rotting on the floor...I'll have to clean it eventually.....I clean kitchen stack stuff tidy wipe surfaces and within hours of him being home it's back the same....sofa gets covered in big black stains because he's too lazy to change after work so sits down in work clothes leaving all sorts of crap on everything (he's a welder, pulling metal splinters out of my feet constantly is sooo much fun üò°) I try to decorate and make it nicer here and I'm wasting my time because 'there's more important things to do like unpacking those boxes and cleaning those clothes and blah blah' I gave him a bag of shit out of his car and told him to sort it and he literally put a couple clothing hits on floor by washing machine, put his rotting coffee cups by sink and threw the still half full bag into a corner.....there's still coffee in a flask from about a month ago that he hasn't fucking washed!! And why should I when it sat in his car for a week and then got dumped by my sink full of mold for me to deal with?!! His excuse is constantly that he's depressed and not motivated, but apparently being diagnosed with stuff wrong with me is just labelling myself and making excuses, kids are looked after, house is in a reasonable state, honestly I feel like dipping out of life every fucking day yet it's my job to do everything, look after everyone, yes he works, he works 8-5 5 days a week, I work 24/7 7 days a week but still get attitude when I try to do something for me....money wise I probably get about the same as him every month with incomes not job related so please no 'he supports you' comments, am I really being unreasonable asking and expecting help in a 'partnership'? No we're not married but living together 9 yrs and having 3 kids it's all just a legality ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è, I'm hesitant to marry again because of the difficulties it brought with the ex, plus my brothers dead and not long before he died we were joking about me marrying him and now it hurts my heart to think aboutüòû.

1gu3a20,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gu3a20,Buying Advice - Sub ¬£500 [UK],"Hello all,

I was fortunate to borrow an Epsom EB-X51 this weekend and I‚Äôve decided to go ahead and buy my own projector üôÇ

There are two rooms in my home I‚Äôd use the projector within. 

For Room A (the second photo attached) and Room B, I can have a throw distance of either >> 3.6m [behind the sofa on a shelf] or
>> 1m. [using a stand or coffee table]

On Saturday for Room A it was configured with the 3.6m throw distance.

What I liked about the Epson
1. Horizon and vertical keystone correction, as the shelf is on a side wall
2. Brightness

What I didn‚Äôt like
1. No audio out
2. Fan noise

The Epson met the brief on the weekend but I acknowledge it is really designed for business/office use for meetings etc.

How would I use the projector?
- I had a Fire stick connected via HDMI and this would be my major use case going forward. 
- It will be used for films, music videos via YouTube and the odd Nintendo Switch gaming session.
- Audio out connectivity is a must. Ideally via Bluetooth but wired is acceptable


My questions
- What models are the best value second hand within my budget?
- Should I wait for the Black Friday deals?
- As I have the choice of throw distance, should I go with short throw or ultra short throw? I was thinking the latter would give me more options for connecting to output audio?




Having browsed other posts, I‚Äôve looked at the often-recommended Benq options via eBay have been offered this W1080ST for ¬£330

https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/116384061337



I will also consider getting a screen depending on cost of the projector.

1gu398e,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1gu398e/the_cabins_rules/,The Cabin‚Äôs Rules,"When the cabin listing popped up on the app, it was like a mirage: secluded, affordable, and ridiculously well-reviewed. I needed an escape‚Äîa break from the suffocating office politics and the suffocating silence of my one-bedroom apartment. The timing was too perfect to question.

I booked it for a week.

The directions emailed by the host were meticulous, almost obsessive. ‚ÄúArrive before sundown,‚Äù they warned. ‚ÄúFollow the path from the gravel road exactly as described.‚Äù The instructions went on for paragraphs, emphasizing that I must never attempt shortcuts or rely on GPS.

When I pulled up to the gravel road in my old Civic, the sun was just beginning its lazy descent. The surrounding woods were dense, and the shadows pooled like spilled ink. The cabin sat deeper within, only reachable by a winding dirt path flanked by towering pines. I followed the handwritten map, tires crunching over fallen leaves. When the cabin came into view, I was struck by its simplicity: a weathered wooden structure with a wraparound porch and a single light glowing warmly through its window.

But something about it didn‚Äôt sit right. It felt‚Ä¶ expectant.

Inside, the place was spotless but oddly sterile, as if no one had lived there for decades despite its cozy furnishings. The air smelled faintly of pine and something else‚Äîsomething metallic. On the coffee table sat a laminated sheet of paper titled¬†**Rules for Guests**¬†in bold, block letters.

I laughed at first. Rules? For a cabin rental? But as I skimmed the list, my amusement curdled into unease.

1. **Never leave the cabin after dark.**
2. **If you hear someone knocking at the door, DO NOT answer it.**
3. **If you hear footsteps inside the cabin at night, stay in bed and pretend to sleep.**
4. **Do not open the basement door under ANY circumstances.**
5. **Burn the candle on the mantel every night. Extinguish it at sunrise.**
6. **Check under the bed before you sleep.**

The last rule was handwritten at the bottom in shaky cursive:¬†**Do not insult the cabin.**

The host had mentioned nothing about these‚Ä¶ quirks. I chalked it up to an elaborate prank or some local superstition meant to spook tourists. Still, something in me hesitated to ignore them outright.

The first night, I followed the rules out of morbid curiosity. I lit the candle, its wax releasing a faint lavender scent, and double-checked under the bed for no other reason than to feel less ridiculous. It was empty.

Outside, the woods were alive with the rustle of leaves and distant animal calls. Inside, the silence was oppressive, broken only by the occasional creak of the floorboards‚Äîsettling, I told myself. But as the hours crawled by, I began to feel watched. The windows, though draped, seemed to hum with a presence just beyond the glass.

At 1:13 a.m., the knocking started.

It wasn‚Äôt loud‚Äîjust a soft, rhythmic tap-tap-tap against the front door. My breath hitched. The logical part of me screamed to ignore it. Still, my hand hovered over the bedside lamp.¬†*No,*¬†I thought.¬†*Stay in bed. Pretend to sleep.*

The knocking continued for what felt like an eternity before stopping abruptly. The silence that followed was heavier than any sound.

By the second day, I was already on edge. The cabin‚Äôs isolation, which I‚Äôd once craved, now felt suffocating. Even mundane tasks like making breakfast felt charged, as if I were being monitored. At times, I thought I saw movement in my peripheral vision‚Äîa shadow darting past the window, a shape reflected in the glass.

Around noon, I decided to explore the property. The fresh air might clear my head, I reasoned. The woods stretched endlessly, and the occasional bird call was a comforting reprieve from the cabin‚Äôs stifling atmosphere. But as I wandered farther, I noticed something strange: no matter which direction I walked, I always seemed to end up back at the cabin. Paths looped inexplicably. Landmarks I swore I‚Äôd passed minutes ago reappeared.

By the time the sun dipped below the trees, I was back on the porch, panting and disoriented.

The second night was worse.

I lit the candle, its flame flickering violently despite the stillness of the room. As I settled into bed, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was under it. I knew I‚Äôd checked earlier, but the thought gnawed at me until I couldn‚Äôt resist. I leaned over, heart hammering, and peered beneath.

It was empty.

Relief washed over me until I heard it: faint footsteps above, slow and deliberate. The cabin didn‚Äôt have an attic‚Äîor so I thought. My chest tightened as the footsteps moved closer, down the hall toward my room.

I squeezed my eyes shut, remembering the rule.¬†*Pretend to sleep.*

The door creaked open.

My breath caught as something moved into the room. I could feel its presence, its weight pressing the air thinner. My back was to the door, and I didn‚Äôt dare turn. It stopped inches from the bed, and the candle‚Äôs light dimmed as if sucked away.

Minutes stretched into hours‚Äîor maybe it was seconds. Eventually, the air shifted, and I heard the faintest whisper: ‚ÄúGood.‚Äù

The presence withdrew. The door clicked shut.

The third day, I wanted to leave. I packed my bags, shoved the rules into my pocket, and loaded the car. But when I turned the ignition, the engine sputtered and died. I tried again and again, but the car refused to start. My phone had no signal, and the cabin didn‚Äôt have a landline.

Defeated, I trudged back inside. As I stepped through the door, I froze.

The basement door, which had been locked since my arrival, was ajar.

A cold draft wafted up, carrying a faint, foul stench. The rules echoed in my mind:¬†*Do not open the basement door under ANY circumstances.*

I should‚Äôve closed it and walked away. But curiosity‚Äîstupid, reckless curiosity‚Äîpropelled me forward. Gripping a flashlight, I descended the creaking stairs. The smell grew stronger, a mix of mildew and decay. At the bottom, the beam illuminated a dirt floor scattered with strange markings‚Äîsymbols carved into the ground, concentric circles, and lines forming a chaotic pattern.

In the center lay a bundle of cloth.

I crouched, hesitating, and then pulled back the fabric.

A human jawbone stared back at me, yellowed and cracked. Panic surged, and I scrambled backward, dropping the flashlight. In the dark, I heard it: a low, guttural growl that wasn‚Äôt human.

That night, I burned the candle for hours, watching the flame dance as shadows writhed on the walls. I couldn‚Äôt sleep. The cabin felt alive‚Äîits groans and creaks no longer random, but deliberate, as if it were breathing, watching, waiting.

At 3:00 a.m., the knocking returned. Louder this time. Insistent. I buried my head under the blankets, tears streaming down my face. But then came the voice.

‚ÄúPlease, let me in,‚Äù it whimpered. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so cold out here.‚Äù

It sounded like a child. But I knew better. My fingers clutched the knife I‚Äôd brought to bed, trembling as the voice grew desperate.

‚ÄúWhy won‚Äôt you help me? Don‚Äôt you care?‚Äù

The knocking turned to pounding, shaking the door on its hinges. I closed my eyes and prayed for morning.

When the sun finally rose, the knocking stopped.

By the final day, I was a shell of myself. Sleep-deprived, paranoid, and haunted, I sat on the porch clutching the rules. I should‚Äôve left when I had the chance. Now, the cabin felt like a trap, a hungry thing that had lured me in.

The candle on the mantel burned low, its wax pooling and hardening in jagged shapes. As twilight descended, I glanced at the damp patch in the ceiling above the bed. It had turned a deep crimson.

I survived the week. Barely.

When I handed the keys back to the agent, she smiled politely and asked, ‚ÄúHow was your stay?‚Äù

I almost told her everything. But when I looked into her eyes, I saw something that stopped me cold: recognition. She knew. They all did.

‚ÄúIt was‚Ä¶ fine,‚Äù I muttered, and walked away.

The cabin still haunts my dreams. Its rules echo in my mind, a grim litany I‚Äôll never forget. I should‚Äôve known better. Some escapes aren‚Äôt worth the price.

But I followed the rules.

And I lived.

Thanks as always to NCD for sending these press samples through - and I have heaps of other NCD reviews [here](https://yuzusvanity.blogspot.com/search/label/nui%20cobalt%20designs)! 

**Honey Trap - Yellow snapdragon, white rose, early spring honey, candied lemon peel, clove bud, and Venus flytrap accord.**

This is a gorgeous, super floral and light blend, featuring pale rose, with just a tinge of honey, and snipped thin green stems. For me, although I initially got a blast of floral, there's also a heavy element of soft grassy freshness here and a touch of watery green that intensifies over time. Although I enjoy the opening, the slow dry down of this scent goes from the more sugary sweet scent with bright petals and cut stems to more of a musky soapy floral, a little clean and a little like starched cotton sheets. I don't love the dry down of this one on my skin, but the opening is truly a lovely hyperrealistic flower market vibe. 



**Honey, I'm Home - Snowdrops and fresh nectar from their first petals unfurled, golden sunlight, yellow crocus, and warmed honeycomb.** 

I really love this scent, this is NCD's honey note at it's sweetest and most fragrant. Freshly applied, it's a stunning blast of sticky, aromatic honey, although it quickly seeps into the skin and allows for a gorgeous earthiness from the crocus to blossom forth. I love the balance here between the sweetness that slowly dries down into more of a darker, caramelized stickiness from the honeycomb, with just a touch of lemon zest, with the crushed petals of the crocus at the heart of this blend grounding it, adding a little earthy sweet floral quality to it. The first few times I wore this, I noticed more of a lemon honey sugar profile with blend, although it's gotten a little more syrupy and darker over time. I like this scent in both ways, but it's mostly the gorgeous warm honey note here that's really carrying this blend, and I would unabashedly wear this whenever I need something sweet. 



**Parisian Apiary - Rooftop hives in the City of Lights inspire this sweetly chic huile de parfum. Cherry blossom, silver linden, white pear, and cafe au lait sweetened with French honey.**

Admittedly, the first few times I tried this scent, I didn't love it - this one is a little bit of a shifter - on opening it's a little jarring, but fades into more of a soft sweet honey speckled with poached pears and cream. While the cafe au lait here was more of a stronger, rich coffee, it fades into more of an aromatic nuttiness, and then an indistinct creamy sweet note. I don't quite read any florals in this scent, not overtly, but I think the original conception and idea of this scent was a little bit of a clashing profile to me - I don't want fruity, floral, coffee and honey all mashed together, and I like that after letting it rest it does settle more into a honey forward scent rather than the original, hectic mismash of everything. I can't say this is a favorite though, so this might be better off with someone else. 



**Aphro-Bee-Siac -  Black vanilla bean, dragon‚Äôs blood resin, ambrette seed, wood musk, barely a spritz of blood orange, and spiced Beltane honey infused with orris root.** 

This is a lovely, dark, heady witchy scent. On opening, this is all dark, bitter and resinous, it has a dark sticky quality from the dragon's blood, and the slightly bitter vibe paired with the heavy wood is a lot. I also get nuances of celery here, but dry down lets the honey blossom forward a little more, and it reminds me of an old cupboard, with honey stains. For me, this scent is rich and evocative, but for me, I'm not a fan of the musk, and I find the heaviness in this scent a little too much for the weather I live in - it's too wood/musk/resin heavy for me, but I'm sure someone else will love this. 



**Nocturnal Bees - Forbidden rice, honeyed black walnut, wild violet, moonflower, and night-blooming jasmine.**

I don't love this - perhaps I'm just not a fan of black walnuts in general, and I'm ambivalent about jasmine at best, and the combination of both leans into scrubber territory for me. On application, it's a nice warm honey, but quickly dries down into indolic jasmine, and is paired with this savoury quality which I can only imagine is the black walnut which is both a little too much like overripe fruit and earthy, dirt covered hands. On certain beats, I get this lovely honeyed nut situation, but overall, this one never quite hits the mark for me. I'll be passing this one on. 



**Bee Not Afraid - Angelic incense, cirrus clouds, glowing beeswax candles, bedstraw, and honey gathered from an ancient cathedral hive.**

While I'm not usually a fan of darker scents, this one is a lovely aromatic atmospheric -  on opening this has a surprisingly zesty quality paired with a slightly nutty, herbal hay scent. For me, the creamy honey really pops out after the dry down and it has a lovely sweet light quality paired with the dry scent of hay and straw. While I originally felt like there was more of a darker, mahogany like woodiness in this, after letting this age, I'm surprised by how much I enjoy this one, with just the lightest touch of incense, a waxy edge and honey drizzled on a rich, dry straw/hay note, this is a really lovely and interesting scent. I love that this isn't too heady, and I love the sweetness here, and the dryness of the hay keeps this from being too gluggy and dense too. This one also reminds me of NCD's gourmands for non-gourmand lovers, this is a subtle one, but one to keep an eye out for. I really love this one, definitely one of my favorites in this collection. 



**Honeycomb Conjecture - Crystallized honey, sturdy oak, cedarwood, granite, ebony, and roasted roots.**

This is fine, it opens with a strong, sticky blast of rich syrupy honey, paired with a dark heavy wood note, definitely a mahogany, oak like accord here. I have to admit, I adore the honey here, it's so sweet and gorgeously rich, and it's almost molasses like, but I'm comparatively cold on the darker woody qualities which get darker, bitter and coffee-esque the longer this wears for. I think I'd just continuously reapply this one, just for the decadent honey, but the wood I can do with or without. However, I do enjoy this one - it's not my favorite but I'll use up the sample for sure. ",2,1731931288.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I was specifically aiming to ask content creators of any kind, here in Bhopal. 

I was intending on starting my own channel, basically about dispensing information about basic issues for citizens. Long story short, I was planning to ask about recording and how to actually pan it out. 

People who have channels or create content, could you please lend some knowledge or insight on same. 

I'd also be available to meet, if it's required but yeah would appreciate a little deeper insight into things. 

I have watched videos on YouTube about it but I could not seem to get by a lot. Perhaps someone could help me out here. Thanks in advance

So you're thinking about starting a business, huh? Maybe you've got that entrepreneurial itch, or you've just realized that the traditional 9-to-5 grind isn‚Äôt cutting it anymore. Either way, you're in the perfect spot to dive into something new and exciting. But with so many options out there, the big question is: Which business should you start?

Good news! Whether you're a fresh entrepreneur or someone looking to expand into new territory, I've got 10 business ideas that are not only high-income but also in demand right now. These ideas can help you leverage today's market trends, technology, and consumer needs to build something profitable and sustainable. Ready? Let‚Äôs jump right into it.

# 1. Digital Product Creation

In the digital age, selling physical goods isn't the only way to make serious money. Creating and selling digital products is one of the best ways to tap into a global audience without worrying about inventory, shipping, or overhead. Plus, once you create a digital product, it can keep generating income with minimal ongoing effort. Here's where you can start:

# Crafting and Selling Online Courses

If you have expertise in a particular subject‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs business, marketing, photography, or even personal development‚Äîthere‚Äôs a good chance people are willing to pay to learn from you. Platforms like **Teachable**, **Udemy**, and **Kajabi** make it easy to create, market, and sell your courses. The key here is to **identify your audience and focus**. Don‚Äôt try to teach everything to everyone. Pick a niche that you‚Äôre passionate about and build a course around that.

For example, if you‚Äôre a fitness expert, create a course on home workouts for busy professionals. People are looking for solutions to their specific problems, and your course can be the answer.

# E-books and Digital Guides

If you‚Äôre more comfortable with writing than teaching on video, e-books and digital guides are your go-to. Whether you‚Äôre sharing **industry expertise, how-to guides, or even fiction**, there‚Äôs a market for digital books. Platforms like **Amazon Kindle Direct Publishing** (KDP) allow you to publish your e-book and reach millions of readers. Plus, you get to keep a significant portion of the profits.

The trick here is to **niche down**. For example, instead of writing a general business strategy book, get specific‚Äîlike ‚ÄúHow to Build a 7-Figure Dropshipping Business on a Shoestring Budget.‚Äù The more targeted your book, the better it will perform.

# Membership Sites

If you‚Äôve got a community or you‚Äôre building one, a membership site can be a goldmine. People are willing to pay for access to **exclusive content, resources, and communities** that help them achieve their goals. Whether it‚Äôs a membership site for entrepreneurs, fitness enthusiasts, or even hobbyists like photographers or writers, the key is to offer ongoing value.

Use platforms like **MemberPress** or **Patreon** to set up your membership site. You can offer different membership tiers with varying levels of access, which gives you the opportunity to cater to a wider range of people while maximizing your earnings.

# Bridge to Next Section: Niche E-commerce Opportunities

While digital products can be a fantastic way to generate passive income, there‚Äôs another lucrative avenue that‚Äôs been gaining momentum‚Äî**niche e-commerce**. Let‚Äôs explore how selling specialized products can make you serious money.

# 2. Niche E-commerce Opportunities

E-commerce is booming, but here‚Äôs the thing: you don‚Äôt have to compete with Amazon to make a killing online. The trick? Focusing on a **niche market**. Specializing in a specific type of product or catering to a specific audience allows you to stand out and build a loyal customer base. Here‚Äôs how you can capitalize on niche e-commerce:

# Curating Specialized Product Collections

Instead of selling every product under the sun, focus on curating a collection of products that cater to a specific audience. Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre passionate about eco-friendly living. You can create an online store that sells sustainable kitchenware or eco-friendly cleaning products. The key is to **find underserved markets** where customers are looking for specialized products but don‚Äôt have many options.

By focusing on a niche, you can position yourself as an expert, build a dedicated audience, and charge premium prices for your products.

# Print-on-Demand Services

Want to sell products without the hassle of inventory? **Print-on-demand** is a fantastic model. You can create custom designs and sell them on t-shirts, mugs, phone cases, and more‚Äîwithout ever touching the product. Platforms like **Printful**, **Teespring**, and **Redbubble** handle the printing, packaging, and shipping for you.

The beauty of this model is that you can test designs quickly and easily. If a design doesn‚Äôt sell, you‚Äôre not stuck with unsold inventory. Plus, you can cater to niche audiences by creating designs that appeal to specific hobbies, interests, or subcultures.

# Online Marketplaces vs. Standalone Stores

One of the first decisions you‚Äôll need to make when starting a niche e-commerce business is whether to sell on **online marketplaces** like Amazon, Etsy, or eBay, or to create your own **standalone store** using platforms like Shopify or WooCommerce.

Selling on marketplaces gives you instant access to a huge customer base, but you‚Äôll have to deal with competition and platform fees. On the other hand, a standalone store allows you to build your own brand and customer base, but it‚Äôs up to you to drive traffic.

A hybrid approach often works best‚Äîstart on a marketplace to validate your product and build a customer base, then transition to your own store as your brand grows.

# Bridge to Next Section: Remote Work Services

As more businesses shift to remote work, there‚Äôs a growing demand for services that cater to virtual teams and professionals. Let‚Äôs talk about how you can capitalize on this trend by offering **remote work services**.

# 3. Remote Work Services

Thanks to tools like Zoom and Slack, the world of work has changed dramatically. Remote work is no longer a trend‚Äîit‚Äôs the new normal. And with this shift comes a massive opportunity for entrepreneurs to offer services that help businesses and individuals thrive in a remote environment. Here are a few ways you can get in on the action:

# Virtual Consulting

If you‚Äôve got experience in a particular field‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs marketing, finance, or business operations‚Äîyou can offer **virtual consulting** services to clients around the world. The beauty of consulting is that it‚Äôs high-ticket, meaning you can charge premium prices for your expertise.

You can work with companies to develop strategies, improve processes, or solve specific problems‚Äîall from the comfort of your home. Platforms like **Clarity.fm** allow you to connect with clients who are looking for short, one-on-one consultations, while LinkedIn is great for finding longer-term clients.

# Online Coaching

Online coaching is booming, and it‚Äôs not just limited to fitness. Whether you‚Äôre a **life coach, business coach, or even a mindset coach**, people are willing to pay for guidance and accountability. The key to being a successful online coach is to focus on **personal development** and helping your clients achieve specific goals.

If you‚Äôre a fitness trainer, for example, you can offer online workout programs and one-on-one coaching sessions via Zoom. If you‚Äôre a business coach, you can help entrepreneurs scale their businesses through weekly coaching calls and personalized strategies.

# Remote Project Management

As more companies embrace remote work, the need for **remote project managers** is growing. Businesses need people who can keep their teams organized, on track, and productive‚Äîeven when team members are spread across the globe.

If you‚Äôve got experience in managing projects and teams, this could be a lucrative business opportunity. Tools like **Trello**, **Asana**, and **Monday.com** make it easy to manage projects remotely, while platforms like **Upwork** and **Freelancer** are great for finding clients.

# Bridge to Next Section: Influencer and Affiliate Marketing

Speaking of working online, there‚Äôs another business model that‚Äôs been making waves in recent years‚Äî**influencer and affiliate marketing**. Let‚Äôs dive into how you can turn your personal brand into a money-making machine.

# 4. Influencer and Affiliate Marketing

If you‚Äôve ever scrolled through Instagram or YouTube, you‚Äôve probably seen influencers promoting products. But here‚Äôs the thing: you don‚Äôt need millions of followers to make money in this space. In fact, **micro-influencers** with smaller, but highly engaged audiences, are making bank by promoting products they love. Let‚Äôs break down how you can get started:

# Building a Personal Brand

The first step to becoming an influencer is to **build a personal brand**. What are you passionate about? What do you want to be known for? Whether it‚Äôs fashion, fitness, tech, or parenting, the key is to be authentic and consistent in your messaging. People follow influencers because they trust their opinions and recommendations, so it‚Äôs important to stay true to yourself.

Once you‚Äôve built a loyal following, you can start partnering with brands to promote their products. But remember, it‚Äôs not about promoting every product that comes your way. Focus on building **authentic engagement** by promoting products that align with your brand and that your audience will actually benefit from.

# Affiliate Partnerships

One of the easiest ways to start making money as an influencer is through **affiliate marketing**. This is where you promote a product, and if someone buys it through your unique affiliate link, you earn a commission. Platforms like **Amazon Associates**, **ShareASale**, and **CJ Affiliate** make it easy to find products to promote.

The beauty of affiliate marketing is that you don‚Äôt need to create your own products‚Äîyou‚Äôre simply earning a commission for referring people to products that already exist. And if you‚Äôve built trust with your audience, they‚Äôre more likely to buy through your recommendations.

# Content Creation That Converts

It‚Äôs not enough to just post a few product links and hope for the best. You need to create **content that converts**. Whether it‚Äôs blog posts, social media content, or YouTube videos, your content should focus on solving problems, offering value, and engaging your audience.

For example, if you‚Äôre promoting a fitness product, create a video showing how you use it in your workouts and explain the benefits. Show your audience how the product can improve their lives, and they‚Äôll be more likely to buy.

# Bridge to Next Section: Health and Wellness Ventures

From promoting products to promoting wellness, the health and wellness industry is another **high-income business opportunity**. Let‚Äôs explore how you can tap into this booming market.

# 5. Health and Wellness Ventures

Health and wellness is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, and it‚Äôs showing no signs of slowing down. Whether it‚Äôs fitness, mental health, or holistic wellness, people are willing to invest in products and services that help them **live healthier, happier lives**. Here are a few ways you can get in on the action:

# Personalized Fitness Apps

With more people working out at home, there‚Äôs a growing demand for **personalized fitness apps** that cater to individual wellness goals. Whether it‚Äôs weight loss, strength training, or mindfulness, fitness apps are a convenient way for people to stay on track with their health goals.

If you‚Äôve got a background in fitness, consider developing your own fitness app. You don‚Äôt need to be a tech wizard‚Äîthere are plenty of **app development platforms** that make it easy to create and launch an app without coding skills. Focus on offering **personalized workouts, meal plans, or mindfulness exercises** that help users achieve their specific goals.

# Holistic Health Coaching

Holistic health coaching is all about helping people achieve **balance in their lives**‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs through nutrition, exercise, or mental health practices. As a holistic health coach, you can offer personalized coaching sessions, group programs, or even online courses that help clients improve their overall well-being.

The key is to combine traditional wellness practices with modern approaches. For example, you can offer programs that focus on **mindfulness, meditation, and stress management**, while also incorporating nutrition and fitness advice. Platforms like **Zoom** and **Kajabi** make it easy to offer virtual coaching and courses to clients around the world.

# Wellness Retreats

If you prefer to work in-person, consider hosting **wellness retreats**. These can be weekend getaways where you offer clients the chance to unplug, relax, and focus on their health. Whether it‚Äôs yoga, meditation, or fitness, wellness retreats are a great way to offer **immersive experiences** that leave a lasting impact.

You can partner with local venues or travel to exotic locations to create unique, **transformative retreats**. The key is to offer a **comprehensive experience** that addresses both the physical and mental aspects of wellness.

# Bridge to Next Section: Sustainability-Focused Businesses

As people become more health-conscious, they‚Äôre also becoming more eco-conscious. The next big opportunity lies in **sustainability-focused businesses**. Let‚Äôs talk about how you can make money by going green.

# 6. Sustainability-Focused Businesses

Sustainability isn‚Äôt just a buzzword‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement, and it‚Äôs here to stay. Consumers are increasingly looking for products and services that are eco-friendly and sustainable, and they‚Äôre willing to pay a premium for them. This is a huge opportunity for entrepreneurs who want to make a positive impact on the planet while making a profit. Here‚Äôs how you can get started:

# Eco-Friendly Product Lines

One of the easiest ways to tap into the sustainability market is by creating **eco-friendly product lines**. Whether it‚Äôs reusable bags, biodegradable packaging, or sustainable clothing, there‚Äôs a growing demand for products that help reduce the environmental footprint.

The key here is to **focus on quality and transparency**. Consumers want to know where their products come from, how they‚Äôre made, and what impact they have on the environment. By offering eco-friendly alternatives to everyday products, you can position yourself as a leader in the green market.

# Consulting for Sustainable Practices

If you‚Äôve got experience in sustainability, you can offer **consulting services** to businesses that want to reduce their environmental impact. Whether it‚Äôs helping companies adopt sustainable practices, reduce waste, or switch to renewable energy, there‚Äôs a growing demand for experts who can guide businesses toward greener operations.

You can work with companies of all sizes, from small startups to large corporations, and help them implement **sustainable solutions** that not only benefit the environment but also improve their bottom line.

# Upcycling Initiatives

Upcycling is all about taking waste and turning it into something valuable. Whether it‚Äôs repurposing old furniture, transforming discarded materials into art, or creating fashion from recycled fabrics, upcycling is a creative and eco-friendly way to make money.

If you‚Äôre crafty or have a talent for design, consider starting an **upcycling business**. You can sell your creations on platforms like Etsy or at local markets, or even host workshops where you teach others how to upcycle their own items.

# Bridge to Next Section: Subscription-Based Models

Sustainability is all about creating long-term solutions, and speaking of long-term, **subscription-based models** are a fantastic way to build recurring income. Let‚Äôs explore how you can create a profitable subscription business.

# 7. Subscription-Based Models

The subscription model is one of the best ways to build a **predictable, recurring income stream**. Whether it‚Äôs physical products, digital services, or exclusive communities, people love the convenience of subscriptions. Here are a few subscription-based business ideas you can start:

# Crafting Unique Subscription Boxes

Subscription boxes are all the rage right now, and for good reason. People love the excitement of receiving something new and unique in the mail every month. Whether it‚Äôs a **beauty box, fitness gear, snacks, or even books**, there‚Äôs a subscription box for just about every niche out there.

The key to creating a successful subscription box is to **curate a unique experience**. Don‚Äôt just throw random products into a box‚Äîfocus on creating a theme or story that resonates with your target audience. And don‚Äôt forget to build a **community** around your subscription box; the more engaged your customers are, the more likely they are to stick around.

# Software as a Service (SaaS)

If you‚Äôre tech-savvy or have an idea for a **digital tool**, consider creating a **Software as a Service (SaaS)** business. SaaS businesses offer software solutions on a subscription basis, and they‚Äôve become incredibly popular in recent years.

The beauty of SaaS is that once you build the product, you can scale it quickly and easily. Whether it‚Äôs a project management tool, a CRM platform, or even a fitness tracking app, the opportunities are endless. Platforms like **Stripe** and **Chargebee** make it easy to set up recurring payments for your service.

# Membership Communities

If you‚Äôve built a loyal following or a niche community, consider creating a **membership community** where people pay for access to exclusive content, resources, or experiences. Whether it‚Äôs a **business mastermind group, a fitness community, or even a book club**, membership communities allow you to offer ongoing value while generating consistent income.

The key to success with membership communities is to offer **real value**. People are willing to pay for access to exclusive content, personalized coaching, or private events, but only if they feel like they‚Äôre getting something they can‚Äôt get elsewhere.

# Bridge to Next Section: Creative Services for Brands

Now that we‚Äôve covered subscription-based models, let‚Äôs shift gears and talk about another high-income opportunity‚Äî**creative services for brands**. If you‚Äôve got a creative streak, this could be the perfect business for you.

# 8. Creative Services for Brands

In today‚Äôs digital world, brands need creative services to stand out. Whether it‚Äôs video production, graphic design, or copywriting, there‚Äôs a growing demand for talented creatives who can help businesses build their brand and tell their story. Here‚Äôs how you can get started:

# Video Production

Video content is king, and brands are hungry for high-quality, **engaging videos** that capture their audience‚Äôs attention. Whether it‚Äôs promotional videos, explainer videos, or even social media content, there‚Äôs a huge market for video production services.

If you‚Äôve got experience in video editing, motion graphics, or production, this is a fantastic business opportunity. You can work with brands to create **engaging videos** that help them connect with their audience and drive sales.

# Graphic Design Solutions

Every brand needs good design, and if you‚Äôve got a talent for **graphic design**, there‚Äôs no shortage of work. Whether it‚Äôs designing logos, websites, social media graphics, or marketing materials, businesses are always looking for talented designers who can help elevate their brand.

You can offer **freelance design services** or even start your own design agency. Platforms like **Fiverr** and **99designs** are great for finding clients, but once you‚Äôve built up a portfolio, you can start marketing your services directly to brands.

# Copywriting and Content Strategy

If you've got a knack for words and storytelling, **copywriting** could be your golden ticket to a high-income business. Brands are desperate for compelling content that not only captures attention but also drives conversions. Whether it's website copy, blog articles, product descriptions, or email campaigns, businesses rely on the written word to sell their products and services.

# Elevating Brand Narratives

Great copy does more than just describe a product‚Äîit tells a story. Consumers are bombarded with marketing messages every day, and the only way for a brand to stand out is by crafting a compelling narrative that resonates with its audience. As a copywriter, your job is to **elevate a brand's voice** and create content that not only informs but also inspires action.

For example, if you're working with a sustainable clothing brand, it's not enough to simply describe the materials used. You need to tell the story of how the materials are ethically sourced, how purchasing from the brand contributes to reducing environmental impact, and how the customer becomes part of a larger movement by choosing sustainable fashion. This deeper narrative connects with the customer on an emotional level, making them more likely to buy.

# Content Strategy: More Than Just Words

There's a big difference between throwing a bunch of words on a page and creating a **strategic content plan**. Brands need content that fits into their overall marketing goals, whether it's building awareness, driving traffic, or converting leads into sales. That's where content strategy comes in.

As a content strategist, you'd be responsible for developing a roadmap for a brand's content, ensuring that every piece of copy serves a purpose and aligns with broader business objectives. This could involve **SEO optimization**, **content calendars**, **social media strategies**, and **lead generation** tactics.

For instance, a solid content strategy might involve writing blog posts that target specific keywords to drive organic traffic, while also crafting persuasive email sequences that nurture leads and ultimately push them towards a purchase.

**Bridge to Next Section: Leveraging Local Markets**

While digital services such as copywriting and content strategy allow you to work with clients from around the globe, there's also huge potential in tapping into your **local market**. Let‚Äôs explore how you can leverage local business opportunities to create a profitable and community-focused venture.

# 9. Leveraging Local Markets

In the digital age, it's easy to forget about the power of the **local market**. But here's the thing: people still want services and products that cater to their immediate surroundings. Local businesses, especially those that offer personalized and community-centric experiences, are thriving. If you‚Äôre looking for ways to capitalize on local demand, here are a few business ideas you can start right in your own neighborhood.

# Pop-up Shops: Test Concepts and Build Community

Pop-up shops are a fantastic way to test a business idea without committing to a long-term retail lease. They allow you to showcase your products or services, connect with customers face-to-face, and build brand awareness‚Äîall without the overhead of a traditional brick-and-mortar store.

Whether you‚Äôre selling handmade crafts, gourmet foods, or fashion items, a pop-up shop gives you the flexibility to experiment with different products, locations, and customer segments. Plus, the **limited-time nature** of pop-ups creates a sense of urgency, encouraging people to visit and make purchases before the shop disappears.

You can partner with local events, farmers markets, or even other businesses to set up your pop-up. The goal is to **create a memorable experience** that not only drives sales but also builds a loyal customer base.

# Local Delivery Services: Convenience in High Demand

In the era of instant gratification, more and more consumers are looking for **local delivery services** that bring products directly to their doorstep. Whether it's groceries, meal kits, or household essentials, convenience is king‚Äîand that‚Äôs where you come in.

You could start a **local delivery service** that caters to specific niches. For example, you could offer eco-friendly grocery delivery, only delivering organic and sustainable products. Or, you could focus on delivering meals from local restaurants that don‚Äôt have their own delivery services.

The key here is to find a **unique angle** that sets you apart from larger delivery platforms like DoorDash or UberEats. By offering **personalized, high-quality service**, you can attract customers who are willing to pay a premium for convenience and reliability.

# Collaborations with Local Businesses: Synergistic Partnerships

One of the great things about working in the local market is that you‚Äôre surrounded by other small businesses that share similar goals. By collaborating with other local businesses, you can create **synergistic partnerships** that benefit both parties.

For example, if you own a local coffee shop, you could partner with a nearby bakery to offer bundled breakfast deals. Or, if you run a fitness studio, you could collaborate with a local health food store to offer discounts for each other's customers. These partnerships not only provide added value to your customers but also help you reach new audiences‚Äîand the best part? It‚Äôs a win-win for everyone involved.

By leveraging the power of your **local community**, you can build a business that is both profitable and impactful.

# Bridge to Next Section: Final Thoughts on Entrepreneurial Growth

As we've explored these 10 high-income business ideas, it's clear that there are countless opportunities for new entrepreneurs to succeed. But as you grow your business, there are a few key principles you'll need to keep in mind. Let‚Äôs wrap things up with some final thoughts on what it takes to thrive as an entrepreneur.

# 10. Final Thoughts on Entrepreneurial Growth

Starting a business is exciting, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîit‚Äôs not always easy. There will be challenges along the way, and success won't happen overnight. However, if you approach entrepreneurship with the right mindset, you‚Äôll be setting yourself up for long-term growth and success.

# Innovation and Adaptability: The Entrepreneur‚Äôs Superpower

One thing you'll quickly learn as an entrepreneur is that the business world is constantly changing. **Trends come and go**, new technologies emerge, and consumer demands shift. The most successful entrepreneurs are those who can **innovate and adapt**.

Take a look at the businesses we've discussed in this article. Whether it‚Äôs creating digital products, launching a niche e-commerce store, or offering remote work services, each of these ideas leverages current market trends. However, the key to success isn‚Äôt just jumping on the latest trend‚Äîit‚Äôs about staying **flexible** and **willing to pivot** when necessary.

For example, if you start a fitness app but notice your users are more interested in nutrition advice, you might pivot and offer meal-planning services. The ability to **stay ahead of the curve** and adapt to changing market conditions is what will give you an edge over the competition.

# Continuous Learning: The Never-Ending Journey

If you think learning stops once you launch your business, think again. Entrepreneurship is a **continuous learning journey**. Whether it‚Äôs mastering new skills, staying updated on industry trends, or learning from your mistakes, the best entrepreneurs are those who **never stop growing**.

Make it a habit to invest in yourself. Read books, take courses, attend workshops, and network with other entrepreneurs. The more you learn, the better equipped you'll be to navigate the ups and downs of running a business.

# Mindset of Exploration and Experimentation

As an entrepreneur, you need to adopt a mindset of **exploration and experimentation**. Not every idea will work, and that‚Äôs okay. The key is to **keep experimenting** and **testing new ideas** until you find what works.

Take failure as a lesson rather than a setback. Every successful entrepreneur has faced failure at some point‚Äîbut it‚Äôs their **willingness to keep going** and try again that sets them apart. The journey of entrepreneurship is filled with twists and turns, but if you approach it with curiosity and resilience, there‚Äôs no limit to what you can achieve.

# The Entrepreneurial Journey: Embrace the Experience

If there‚Äôs one thing I want you to take away from this article, it‚Äôs this: **entrepreneurship is an adventure**. It‚Äôs not always easy, and it‚Äôs not always predictable. But for those who are willing to put in the work, take risks, and embrace the journey, the rewards are well worth it.

Whether you decide to create digital products, open a niche e-commerce store, or dive into influencer marketing, the opportunities are endless. But the most important thing is to **start**. Don‚Äôt wait for the ""perfect"" idea or the ""right"" time. The best time to start is now.

Remember, entrepreneurship isn‚Äôt about having all the answers‚Äîit‚Äôs about **figuring things out as you go**. So take that first step, and enjoy the ride. The world of business is out there waiting for you, and with the right mindset and a willingness to learn, there‚Äôs no telling how far you can go.

# Final Words: You‚Äôve Got This

Now, armed with these 10 high-income business ideas and a clear understanding of what it takes to thrive as an entrepreneur, you‚Äôre ready to take the plunge. Don‚Äôt be afraid to **take risks**, **try new things**, and most importantly, **trust in your ability** to build something incredible.

You‚Äôve got the knowledge. You‚Äôve got the drive. Now go out there and make your entrepreneurial dream a reality!

And there you have it‚Äîa comprehensive guide packed with high-income business ideas for new entrepreneurs. Whether you‚Äôre aiming to launch your first business or looking to expand into new territory, the opportunities are endless. The key is to **take action**, stay adaptable, and never stop learning.

1gu2s5u,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1gu2s5u/kitchenaid_marketing_machine_quality/,Kitchenaid Marketing - Machine Quality," I have a giga 10 now (more than a year) and had a KA at work.  I was a fan of the CM5300 for a best buy with cravats, then the Kitchenaid came out.  Background on the Kitchenaid models, where they come from and my total unprofessional thoughts are in this long review.   At the time of writing the friends and family discount was not an option, and I get into why compared to other machines I think its the best performance/value.    They are well made machines that perform at a fair pricing when you buy at EEP.  Keep in mind, ALL of these espresso machines sell for 50% less in Europe.  It is not the cost changing from 220v to 120v that doubles the price, its because Americans love paying for perceived value and marketing.   Jura z10s are are 1800eu, Giga 10 2200eu, Miele cm5300 599 eu, Dinamica 699eu at almost everyday pricing, so keep the EU pricing in mind, i consider it a fair value.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1coxq81/look\_what\_daddy\_got\_kitchenaid\_super\_automatic/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1coxq81/look_what_daddy_got_kitchenaid_super_automatic/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

That being said.  I do think past few weeks Kitchanaid has made a no so subtitle aggressive social media push including on Reddit.  There is no doubt 2 undercover guys affiliated with KA.  A 3rd guy too.  When I asked the 3rd guy if he worked for KA he deleted his account.  I think covert marketing is wrong, hurting society and people should own it. Mods should be more proactive too.

My totally out of thin air hypothesis to why the big push on marking is they obviously want to turn over stock.  I think KA was very aggressive in putting out a quality machine, it's a new market segment for the company and I think they want strong sales numbers.  With KA's consumer centric focus and aggressive push to market, I wouldn't be surprised if a KF9 is launched with wifi in the spring or 2026.  Infrastructure like that can take time to buildout which I think conflicted with KA's desire to enter the super auto market quickly with the KF6-8. Again, total guess but it wouldn't surprise me.

My experience with observing Jura and Miele is these companies need to agree to a MOQ with E/P.   If you look at Miele's CM53 series they are dated, and Miele still has what seems like plenty CM5300's they are still trying to sell without obliterating their pricing structure and perceived value.  The CM5300 was $1600 first released around 2018. The MOQ for a new market segment/new KA department was a risk for KA and they want to deliver a clear cut win to the bosses.

The other thing all the marketing and EEP sales do is get more machines out there for free advertising. They are easy to talk about and to suggest, so the push to get them out the door creates a great base too because they will surly raise their prices. 

The in your face marking is wrong, annoying and detracting from the quality of the machine.  There could be people just excided about getting a new machine, but honestly speaking, I think KA is trying to aggressively saturate the market with machines to get them out there, like a free tshirt.  At $1k or so, its the best machine on the market for no nonsense espresso.  At the pricing, Its hard to suggest a jura honestly even if you can get a z10 for $2200, is coffee not magic and I love Kitchenaid for going after it, the industry needed real competition.  I hope it does, but I wouldn't expect the current pricing to last.",1,1731929916.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

And the past few months I‚Äôve gotten more into his life and career not just his music, and ever since then anywhere I go that isn‚Äôt related to MJ something related to him will appear.

Like, I went shopping to get groceries and a bunch of Michael songs played. Lowk thought it was a coincidence cuz it was around Halloween and thriller is pretty popular round those times.

But then a few weeks ago I went to get coffee with a friend and while we were there 3 different michael songs played on the radio. Most of the music was 2010-20s, but suddenly songs from the 80s played?? 

They were Bad, Tabloid Junkie, and Leave me Alone if you were wondering.

Then I had to leave the coffee shop and my friend stayed for awhile, she said after I left not a single MJ song played.

I decided to try to spice up my music taste and listen to songs I‚Äôve never heard and three of them sampled MJs songs, like wtf?

During Halloween I ran into someone dressed like Thriller MJ, and that freaked me out bc most people in my town don‚Äôt like him, so I was shocked. Like I full on ran into the dude.

AND JUST NOW I WENT INTO A SUBREDDIT UNRELATED TO MJ AND THIS APPEARS? (Image above)

I swear I‚Äôm being followed by bro bc anytime I‚Äôm NOT thinking abt him (rarely) he makes his presence known and suddenly I‚Äôm thinking bout him üò≠üò≠",6,1731929810.0,MichaelJackson,1,1.0,False

1gu2qcg,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneur/comments/1gu2qcg/journaling_and_meditating_to_be_a_better/,Journaling and meditating to be a better entrepreneur,"Hello all - someone made a post about their struggles with guilt during downtime, and I replied with the below which turned out to be 3 comments worth of text, so I thought I'd also make a full post here for anyone who might be struggling with anything similar.

I've found this stuff to be infinitely helpful to keep me calm, clear-minded, and organised during work, but also crucially - feeling good about myself and the path that I'm on.

Being an entrepreneur (especially a relatively new one like myself) can be a real struggle - it's a scary, stressful and often very lonely place, and the better equipped we are to handle the mental challenges that come with the territory, the better we can be for our customer, our teams and ourselves.

Enjoy! Any feedback welcome of course, and any relevant tips y'all might have yourselves would be great too!



My journaling method has been compiled/stolen from various other methods over the last couple years. It's basically a template that I open once in the morning as soon as I wake up, and once in the evening to 'wrap up' my day, formatted as such:



# Morning

**Intentions for today**

*Here I note down up to 3 things I intend to do today.*

*Sometimes they are work related (e.g. finish and send that quote to X, work on Y's project for 4 hours etc.) but they can also be personal or health related.*

*Whatever the intentions are, they are always measurable in some way to avoid vagueness - either by completion vs not-completed, x hours, number of/amount of x etc. - that way when the day's over I know 100% if I did it or not.*

*Only up to three because any more than that you leave yourself open to 'overstuffing' your day with non-essential stuff, or giving yourself too much to do. Of course reality is that you will have tons of micro and macro tasks throughout your day, but labelling the 3 most important ones gives you something tangible and productive to aim for.*

*It's also good for rewarding yourself and reinforcing your beliefs that you are a productive and organised person - self-image genuinely controls so much of your life without you even noticing. You are what you believe you are - and right now you believe that you are a person who doesn't work enough or that you don't deserve downtime.*

*Change that belief and the emotions will follow. Become a person who definitely, measurably and indisputably did enough work today, and then be that same person again tomorrow.*



**3 Things I'm grateful for today**

*This one is important for my mental health - to remind myself that there's a lot of good in my world and to be appreciative of it. Something as simple as 'this coffee' (which is a go-to for me on many mornings when I can't think of anything more profound), or could be a friendship, family member, thing you did (had fun at x event), thing you have (the use of my legs, my own business, a laidback lifestyle etc.), or even a thing you are (kind, happy, fit, healthy etc. - this is good for simply appreciating yourself as a human being)*



**Dream Journal:**

*Here I just write down what I can remember from my dream as I use dream analysis as a tool for figuring out internal stuff. It's useful for noticing patterns - e.g: when I drink too much I have hazy, nonsense dreams, or when I waste the day on YouTube my dreams are stressful. I usually complete this first thing whilst it's still fresh in my head and then go back to the start.*



**Morning Journal:**

*Here I basically just braindump for a few minutes what I'm thinking about, feeling or any concerns or wider intentions I have for the day ahead that don't fit nicely into my bullet list at the start. Sometimes it's incoherent rubbish, sometimes it's a 'virtual cry', sometimes it's something to motivate me or excite me. I don't really have a structure I just write and see what comes out.*



# Evening

*So once the day's over and it's around bedtime, I open the same document back up and resume from the 'Evening' section.* 

**Recap today:**

*Here I just summarise what I did during the day. This is a good place to be honest about the day's level of work, exercise, productive time etc. and to spot any issues (wasting an hour on YouTube, or eating a shitty meal/ignoring my diet, or brain fog at a certain time during work).*

*This also serves to basically highlight when I've done well because whilst writing I'm basically discovering if I'm happy with how I spent my day, and if I'm not, I have some intentions or goals I can set for the next day, and that sort of 'puts away' the guilt for me. I don't have to beat myself up, because I've already pointed out the issue and made a promise or effort to be better next time. I think the simple act of getting it out on the page does wonders, and the bonus is that it's trackable over time.*



**Intentions Fulfilled? If not, why not?**

*This is simple - did I or didn't I do what I said I was going to do in the 'Intentions' section at the start of this journal? If I did, great - I kicked today's ass and I can be proud of that. If I didn't I need to write down why I didn't. This helps because I'm basically unpicking what happened in my day to lead to me not fulfilling my goals.*

*Sometimes it's excusable because I may have prioritised something more important that came up, or maybe one of the previous intentions/goals for the day took longer than expected so I didn't get time, or maybe I chose to do something beneficial for other parts of my life, like my physical/mental health or social environment, which is my prerogative as an entrepreneur.*

*Sometimes, of course - it's because I wasted time, procrastinated, ate a big carby meal and my energy fell flat, or knocked off early because I couldn't be arsed working any more. These are the measurable reasons where I might rightfully be a bit pissed off at myself - however again, the act of writing these out and being honest with myself helps me not to make the same mistake again tomorrow, and again, I'm improving.*

*Sometimes it's an easy fix that isn't something I should beat myself up about, but rather just something adapt to stop the problem repeating in future. If a carby meal makes me low energy during the work day, I should avoid a carby meal until after work - simple, and now a fixed issue.*



**Evening Journal:**

*Like the morning journal, another braindump area to write about my feelings for the day, and expand on areas that don't fit into the other sections. Viewing the previous sections of the day's journal entry let me see how my mood may or may not have changed since the morning, or see if I've been hung up on a particular issue, or interpersonal thing, or work thing or whatever. It's a good excuse to vent when I'm angry or sad, cheer about things that make me happy or unpick certain positive/negative thought patterns I might have been having that day to better understand them.*



  
Now for the meditation side of things:



# Meditating

For meditating, if you don't already do it, start with 5 minutes/day and do it every day for a week. Add a minute the next week (so 6 mins a day for a week) and keep doing that until you work up to as much time as you can realistically allow yourself - I'm on 20 minutes/day currently and I've stuck with that for a while because I don't feel like I have room in the day for much more, but I plan to up it to an hour a day at some point.

As for the method, just look up some sort of simple meditation that floats your boat and do that - there's tons of methods and most will give you the same benefit. I simply sit with my eyes closed and just try and let my thoughts float away. It sucks at first but even briefly meditating for a few minutes per day yields a lot of genuine mental benefits like calmness, clarity and patience which are pretty key qualities for an entrepreneur to have. Plus, it's free and you don't need any equipment, and you can do it anywhere at any time so there's no reason not to start.

Just make sure you stick with it consistently, and set an alarm or habit tracker up to remember to do it every day. If you miss a day, do it twice the next day. Real benefits take a looooong time to come. Naval Ravikant described it in a way that really resonated with me which is that the aim is to get to 'Inbox Zero':

Imagine your brain is an email inbox, and thoughts are emails. Meditating is the process of 'reading' those emails. Not by 'engaging' with the thoughts, or unpacking them, but simply by acknowledging or witnessing them, and then allowing them to pass. When you start meditating, you got a lot of unread emails - thousands if not tens of thousands. It's going to take you a while to read all those emails. Eventually - you'll get to a place (years down the line) where you're only ever catching up on emails from that day. So don't be disheartened when you find yourself spiraling down a thought rabbit hole or not being able to relax - you still have 8,562 unread emails!

I‚Äôm up as usual for my writing time until about 6. My head is filled with thoughts about the past and future‚Äîshould I get to work early for a busy day? I hope Lynn got my message. I need to check the tire pressure. And of course, there‚Äôs my morning coffee.

I‚Äôm at the coffee machine now. I vaguely remember walking from the bedroom to the kitchen, but who cares? I can already taste the bitterness that will wake me up. The whir of the Nespresso machine feels like it‚Äôs droning on forever. I‚Äôm running a little late and want to get to my writing. I check the time and take a moment to stretch. The aroma excites my body and stirs my mind. I feel impatient.

The whirring crescendo signals the end is near. Anticipation grows. The cup is at my lips. I don‚Äôt recall getting it there, but it‚Äôs there. The hot, bitter liquid touches my tongue and takes my attention. In this moment, thoughts disappear. Past and future dissolve. I am no more.

A moment later, thoughts flood back - how good that first taste is, how much I like the flavor, how my body feels less stiff, and how I can now get to work. But for a brief instant, there was only the present - no past, no future, no pressure, no time. I call this an **Observant Moment**: a timeless experience that arises and fades as it pleases.

To me, Observant Moments hint at another state of being, one from which we‚Äôre often separated by the constant pull of thoughts about the past and future. I‚Äôm curious‚Äîwhat Observant Moments have you experienced? How do thoughts and emotions pull you away from the present?

I've been working on a web app which will allow people to import their banks transactions, tag them (either individually or using rules to match all transactions from X), and then it will provide the sum totals for each category (i.e trading income, capital expense, ect.).

Here are some screenshots of the work in progress to give you an idea how it would work:

[Tagging, with filter, sort and search for all the columns](https://preview.redd.it/q20qnza79n1e1.png?width=2990&format=png&auto=webp&s=e7a7e9a4be484bc12d3dd3f7e648674739766767)

This is solely aimed at small businesses who have relatively simple accounts, if the business is larger or a group business it's going to need more complex accounting. For example:  
 \- It won't be useful if you have capital expenditures over the ¬£1m limit  
 \- Doesn't handle inventory (for the moment anyway), so aimed at service businesses  
 \- Doesn't handle VAT, so if the business is over the VAT limit another option will be better  
 \- Doesn't aim to provide tax advice

What it does do:  
 \- Provide a super fast and simple way to sum the last tax years transactions into the relevant tax figures for small businesses which can then either be sent to your accountant or used to fill out the CT600  
  
If you're someone who might use this, I'd love any feedback. Specifically, I'm wondering whether you'd prefer it free with just the ability to import transactions from CSV files or if you'd prefer to pay something like ¬£10-20/year to also have the ability to link to your bank and automatically download up to the last 24 months of transactions?",1,1731929003.0,smallbusinessuk,4,0.67,False

I have a Tassimo machine, which I sort of persevered with for a couple of years on and off, but to be honest, it tastes like crap compared to Costa so I have given up on this and I am now looking for an upgrade.

  
I am fairly simple and also fairly lazy. I don't have time in the morning to be weighing everything, manually making sure everything is perfect for the perfect coffee. I simply want to wake up and make the best possible Latte in the shortest amount of time with the least amount of effort.

Essentially, I want something that is easy to use, as automated as possible and will make me a nice Latte which is as good or better than the Costa Express machines / Costa shop. 

Is the Barista Express Impress a good choice?

Background: My husband and I married when I was 20 and he was 21. We are now 23 and 24. We met while I was on vacation in Turkey and dated long distance until we married a year later in his own country (Turkey) and came back to the states, applying for a visa for him to live here (we went long distance again until he was approved and is now living with me in an apartment). Due to the distance we had to time to actually be engaged and got married straight away to start the visa process, not allowing either one of us to really gauge how we would do in a living scenario or anything really. 

Anytime we were long distance, before marriage and after (until he got his visa) I noticed how controlling he was. I don‚Äôt have any friends. If was ever with my cousins for instance or my own aunts and family here, he would suddenly get distant over text and seemed to not like the fact that I am spending any time with god forbid my own cousins. He would ask what I am wearing, to show him what I am wearing (I always wore pants and covered clothes). Whenever I am out at a family gathering at the park for instance, he always got distant in a way and messaged me less. Not sure if this was out of jealousy but it was very irritating as I was constantly looking at my phone thinking he is angry at me for no reason while I was supposed to be spending time with my own family. It gave me anxiety. Even over FaceTime, after a family gathering for instance, he completely shifts his behavior and I have to ask, is everything okay? 

Fast forward to now, he has been living in the states for a year now and is adjusting to life here. Let‚Äôs me wear whatever I want now (but I am still careful of course as I am married ) doesn‚Äôt mind shorts and stuff as much for instance. He provides for me financially, lets me purchase anything by I want, I cook for him, clean, do laundry, everything a wife does. I am in college right now about to enter an MRI program, working only once a week while he is working full time 3 days a week. 

 The situation: 
I recently got food poisoning eating outside. The worst of it which was vomiting and all, hit me midnight and lasted until 8am . I told my husband how I believed I was food poisoned right before he went to bed, but he went to bed. It got bad. The vomiting and diarrhea lasted until 8am and I did not truly sleep until 10am. Sometime around the middle of this timeframe, my husband awakened and asked ‚Äúare you vomiting love?‚Äù And I say yes I am. He proceeded to go back to sleep. I was surprised (I am a strong person so I didn‚Äôt really ask for help or anything). After I was able to get sleep from 10am to 3pm, I immediately started vacuuming the house, doing laundry/washing our bedding, deep cleaning the shower, doing dishes all while still recovering from food poisoning and even vomited once while cleaning bc the shower. During this he was waiting on the couch for the Mike Tyson vs Jake Paul fight to start. But I still feel like he could have checked in on me a bit more as the only thing he helped me with was vacuuming half the apartment for me (not even all of the half). He helped me a little bit but longgg after the worst of it was over which he wasn‚Äôt even awake for. 

Fast forward, he gets food poisoning the evening after I recover. I take care of him as soon as I get back from work, brought him gatorades and bananas from work and made sure he‚Äôs maintains his fluids and has some electrolytes and simple carbs like saltine crackers. He would even refuse to eat a single cracker (which made me wonder why I am helping him in the first place) but I still ended up convincing him. The next day comes around and he is still recovering from lost electrolytes but definitely not vomiting or anything at all. The worst of it is over for him as food poisoning hits hard and fast. He gets mad at me for not taking care of him and wanting to go to my mom‚Äôs house for a little bit even though he has recovered. I feel that he was babied a lot by his mother and even WITNESSED it when we recently visited her last month in Turkey, so I straight up told him like I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm not going to baby you. And where were you when I was vomiting and you had the courage to ask me if I am actively vomiting and proceeded to sleep the night away? What about when I was deep cleaning the shower or doing dishes while I was recovering but you were watching the Mike Tyson fight?  So I went to my mom‚Äôs house. 

This same day around 4PM I went to my moms house (which is 10 minutes away) and even bought groceries for us and marinaded joojeh chicken that I can grill the next day and at around 7pm -9pm  he asks me:

-‚ÄúWyd?‚Äù
-‚ÄúAre you gonna come home late?‚Äù
-‚ÄúWell I miss you, I am going to be working the next 4 days‚Äù

Proceeds to call me at 10:32 while I am sitting right next to my mother, ‚ÄúBaby, it‚Äôs TOO late‚Äù 
This right here is where the problem is. When he tells me it‚Äôs too late and he always, always wants me back home at a certain time when I am at my own family‚Äôs house just because I wanted to spend time with them. Later when I got home at 11ish, he didn‚Äôt say a word to me. No hello, nothing. I thought he ‚Äúmissed me?‚Äù As he had texted me that earlier‚Ä¶ So I said Hello. He was like why are you back so late? I told him how when we were in Turkey last month he was out with his own friends until 12 or 1 AM while I was waiting (without grudges, any anger etc) and welcomed him home. and how he is also lucky that I don‚Äôt have any  friends at all and am just staying a bit later with my own mother! He proceeds to show me his phone and how he saw people on Reddit saying that a wife should listen to their husband about what time to return home by. Little does he know that those people posting on Reddit saying that they expect their wives to be home at this time and how they listen, are those wives who have friends and who go out with FRIENDS. Not FAMILY. I don‚Äôt even have any friends! I seriously don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. I got angry and came back to my mom‚Äôs house because I don‚Äôt want to be trapped or controlled if it boils down to my family. My family has provided SO, SO much for us and without the permission of my brother, he wouldn‚Äôt even be married to me right now. My parents have done a hell lot for us and he is not grateful for anything. My parents paid for our most of our wedding and his family in Turkey could barely contribute anything. My parents also spent 3k on our apartments couches, coffee table, and lots of furniture when we didn‚Äôt have the money for anything when we first moved out. I told him the couches we are sitting on is from my mother! And you give me a time to come home at night from her place? Really? He is still mad at the fact that my mom actually made us move out in the first place. She made us move out several months after he arrived here in the states (When he first came here by Visa, my mom, dad and brothers allowed him and I to stay at their house for a bit until my mom said we basically have to leave/move out because I made him bring along the Scottish fold cat we got in Turkey together which my  brothers who lived in my parents house as well, were very allergic to. So we moved out not too far from my parents house.) he still holds a grudge about it to THIS DAY even though I told him to bring the cat along. 
If we ever argue, he is defensive. Because of his ‚Äúpride‚Äù. It takes forever until he says sorry, and he glosses over what I am saying. He is passive aggressive, can be controlling, and I used to even believe he was a narcissist at some point bc of how he mirrors. He doesn‚Äôt kiss me goodnight, Goodmorning. Nothing. I don‚Äôt like affection but I would appreciate these things even! I don‚Äôt know what to do. He changed so much from when I first met him. When he arrived in the states suddenly he is so ungrateful for everything, has pride for some reason. I told him that my cousin (who is married with 3 kids goes on road trips sometimes with her cousins and all her husband says is ‚Äúsure love, I‚Äôll watch the kids.‚Äù But my husband keeps messaging me or trying to get me back home and if I get home late he yells at me! For being with my own family. I don‚Äôt even have friends, I am in college, I don‚Äôt know what to do anymore. He provides for me financially and stuff, just not mentally and emotionally. His anger problems and passive aggressiveness, emotional immaturity is even the cause for our dead bedroom. I just don‚Äôt feel anything anymore. And I am 23! I even used to get baby fever but now can‚Äôt even think of having babies anytime near the future as I am in college and am thinking about how I don‚Äôt want to end up like his mom who deals with his fathers anger issues and doesn‚Äôt do anything about it and accepts it. I am not his mom and will not accept to turn out like her. 

 Any advice?.. I am still young (23) and am asking due to the fact that I will not stay this young forever and want to live a happy marriage with an emotionally mature man who I know I will not regret starting a family with in the future. Thank you. ",1,1731928181.0,Divorce,4,1.0,False

I‚Äôd like to get him a gift that feels caring, is low energy to engage with, and subtly acknowledges the huge health related drop in his energy levels.
Ideally it‚Äôd be something that a) is easy to gently engage with as a hobby or pastime, perhaps linking to his general Science Nerd nature, or b) makes a moment of luxury out of something in daily life.


Backstory: This year he got through cancer and onto a treatment that works and won‚Äôt reduce his life expectancy (there is no cure but this treatment is basically a cure you keep taking). The cost is his energy, he has maybe 40% or less of previous. It‚Äôs forcing him to retire earlier and under circumstances I know he privately finds bitterly disappointing. It‚Äôs not what he hoped for in his later life.

He‚Äôs terrible at tuning into his emotions (the only criticism I could ever level at a wonderful man and loving father) so I can‚Äôt say to him in words that I‚Äôll help him make sure he has a good life with fun and joy in it still, because he won‚Äôt let us talk about it. But a gift that demonstrated this even in micro would be noticed, he will note the significance and know I‚Äôve seen him.

Usually my dad is easiest to buy for because we have basically the same interests (sci-fi, coffee, cycling) but this year I can‚Äôt find the thing that will say this for me.",1,1731928138.0,Gifts,1,1.0,False

I just want to check that I‚Äôm on the right track here with diagnosing my issues. I received my Bambino Plus today but am still awaiting my Baratza ESP to arrive. I have some pre-ground coffee already so I thought I‚Äôd give it a crack.  It is maybe a month or so old.

I go straight for the non pressurized basket and load in 18g. Hit the double shot and it takes about 15 seconds. Taste awful. Thought I‚Äôd try the pressurized basket and same deal. So I try the razor tool for both and it actually wants me to take out a fair bit. It‚Äôs probably now dosing with 15-16g. Same thing, takes about 15-17 secs to extract. 

This pre-ground coffee is actually more coarse than I think it should be and it‚Äôs clearly under extracting. I‚Äôm assuming I just need to wait for the grinder and then I can hit my bag of proper beans up and grind properly? Am I missing anything else? It makes sense that it needs to be finer as it‚Äôs under extracting  and I can‚Äôt load a proper 18g shot as the razor is saying there is too much. If finer, it would be more dense and therefore the razor wouldn‚Äôt be saying it is over dosed. That‚Äôs my take on it anyway. I did think I‚Äôd get away with using the pressurized baskets though.

Once the darkness settled over me, I felt as if I was being yanked. Like a parent pulling their child out of the way of a car. Before I could consider the irony of that thought, I blinked and was suddenly in a completely different clearing.

My senses were assaulted by the difference. Smells, sights, temperature, everything had altered enough to be noticeable. My stomach decided to become an acrobat, and I had to fight to keep it from spewing its contents.

""Well, that looked unpleasant,"" someone said.

Nash, Yulk, and I glanced at each other and turned to look at the person who spoke. Mumuldobran sat on a log that was next to a stump, smoking what looked like a hand rolled cigarette. It gave us an uncharacteristically merry wave.

Nash and Yulk regarded the King of Arch-Fae for a moment, then simultaneously turned and vomited. I fought even harder to keep my food within me. My orc brothers breathed heavy sighs of relief once they were finished.

""It was unpleasant, yes,"" Yulk said.

""So we were... What? Teleported?"" Nash asked.

""Felt more like being pulled through time and space,"" I answered through gritted teeth.

""Yeah, that's about right,"" Mumuldobran said. ""When wylder do it, we get rid of our bodies first. Flesh doesn't like being pulled through the fair-realm.""

""The what?"" Yulk asked with a sudden interest.

Feeling my knees about to give out, I decided to have a seat on the ground to recover.

""The fair-realm. It's where we reside when we're not in physical form,"" Mumuldobran took a hefty drag from his cigarette. ""Sort of a giant void where beings of energy, nothingness, and somethingness hang out. Has neither space nor time, so it's a pretty convenient way to travel. If you've got the stomach for it.""

""Which we don't, apparently,"" Nash sighed. ""Nick, you'll feel better if you just throw up.""

""I'd rather die,"" I growled. ""Had spicy food for breakfast. Gonna hurt coming up.""

Nash and Yulk chuckled. Mumuldobran, on the other hand, giggled. All three of our heads snapped to look at him.

""What?"" it asked.

""You seem to be in much higher spirits than you were when we first met,"" Yulk said.

""What's in that smoke?"" Nash asked with suspicion in his voice.

Mumuldobran raised an eyebrow and eyed the cigarette for a moment. It flicked the ash from the end and took another deep drag.

""It's smoke-seed,"" it said as it inhaled. A somewhat rare fibrous bean-like plant that contains various stimulants. Namely, caffeine.""

""That sounds kind of like coffee,"" I added, still struggling with my stomach.

""Not quite,"" the arch-fae laughed. ""The various stimulants in smoke-seed combine to form a pretty hard punch. A punch that's fatal to most mortals, in fact.""

""Then why's it called smoke-seed?"" Nash asked.

""That's what WE call it,"" Mumuldobran giggled again. ""No idea what YOU call it. Though, some of your villages grow it for us. Trade and such. Plants that contain high levels of sugar and caffeine are our primary import.""

""Why?""

""Because we thrive off of these chemicals. Sugar rejuvenates us, like a warm meal and bath do for you. Caffeine has a profound mental impact that allows us to focus in ways that we normally aren't able to accomplish.""

""Very interesting,"" Yulk nodded. ""What do you exchange with the Unified Chiefdoms?""

""Lumber and magical trinkets, mostly.""

""We're getting sidetracked. Why are we here?"" I interrupted a little impatiently.

""How should I know?"" Mumuldobran asked, bewildered. ""Who sent you through the fair-realm?""

""Veern.""

""Veern? Arch-fae, about this high?"" it gestured above its head.

""Yeah, that's the one.""

""That's... Weird. Just a second.""

Mumuldobran's eyes rolled into the back of its head and it slouched, nearly dropping its cigarette. The rest of us shared a worried glance. I took a few deep breaths and rose to my feet just as Mumuldobran recovered, looking far more sober than it had a moment ago.

""I see,"" it muttered.

""Care to share?"" I asked.

""Not really, but I suppose I must. Have a look at the stump.""

The three of us approached the stump that Mumuldobran was sat next to. As we got closer, we realized that the wood had been carved to look like a forest. Bugs sat patiently on top of the small carvings, as if marking points of interest.

""We are being attacked,"" Mumuldobran puffed at his cigarette. ""Vampires.""

""Vampires? Why?""

""I'm unsure, but the screams coming from the fair-realm indicate something sinister. What I do know is that they're well-organized and using captured wylder as shields.""

""What's a wylder?"" I asked.

""Me. And the other fair-folk. Essentially, anyone who is an intricate part of the cycle of wylds.""

""Ah,"" I said, barely understanding the explanation.

""Anyway, the use of our comrades as shields is a rather smart move, as it prevents us from using the arch-fae to their fullest potential.""

""Why's that?"" Nash asked.

""Well, our strength isn't exactly subtle,"" Mumuldobran chuckled. ""By using our powers to kill the brood, we'd be unable to avoid killing the wylder captives.""

""You don't want to kill your friends,"" I said empathically.

""What? No. They'd just come back, wouldn't be a problem. The issue is that killing them is considered a sin by the higher ones. Meaning that we would be punished for it. If we kill enough of them and the enemy manages to kill US... Well, we might end up on their side of this fight.""

""Ah, yeah, that would be bad,"" I nodded. ""So... why are we here?""

""The higher ones pulled a bit of trickery, as they do. You see, I requested help from a certain group of wylder which Veern is a part of. This group of wylder, however, owes my group nothing and is not beholden to our calls for aid. If they were to aid us, we would be in their debt,"" Mumuldobran explained. ""I am fine with this, the other kings are fine with this, but the higher ones dislike us trading favors with each other. One wrong word leads to chaos and such. So, they took it upon themselves to interfere and send you instead, since we are beholden to each other.""

""Yeah, but, Veern owed the higher ones a favor. Why didn't they just use that to get them to help you?""

""Mortals trading favors owed by others is quite a bewildering concept, if I'm honest. When you owe someone a favor, they are the one that you owe that favor to. No self-respecting wylder would ever get caught in the web of mental gyrations required to justify having to do something for someone you are not beholden to because you're beholden to someone else. That's just silly,"" it giggled. ""Plus, I don't think the higher ones wanted them to help us to begin with. They definitely wanted YOU here, though.""

""Any idea as to why?""

""Nope.""

Swearing under my breath, I looked at the trunk-map. What am I supposed to do, go and fight an army of vampires? I could definitely take down a few of them, but judging by the number of red bugs on the stump that would just be a drop water in the ocean.

""If you can't use the arch-fae, what are you doing instead?"" Yulk asked.

""Using the lesser wylder. Don't tell them I called them that,"" Mumuldobran giggled again. ""But there's a problem there, too. The enemy is grabbing our soldiers and using iron to capture them. The various forms of fae, fairies, and such are putting up a fight but...""

""It's not enough,"" I said flatly. ""What sort of formations are you using?""

""Formations?""

The three of us glanced at each other and then stared at Mumuldobran in disbelief.

""Like, battle formations? How are your troops sorted?""

""Sorted? We're just fighting. So is the enemy, for the most part.""

""Like a mob? What..."" I trailed off, thinking. ""So it's basically just a large brawl between two groups.""

""Don't be dismissive. This is a proper war, not some riot,"" Mumuldobran crossed its arms.

""What weapons are your soldiers using?""

""Magic, for the most part. The bone and blood fae sometimes use swords and spears.""

""This is a mess,"" Nash muttered. ""Uh... No offense.""

""Some taken,"" Mumuldobran's eyes narrowed.

""If you want to turn things around, you're going to need to be more organized,"" I explained. ""If you have groups that use similar weapons, then it's easier to know where to put them to counter the enemy. Since the enemy is trying to kidnap your soldiers, some safeguards should be taken, too.""

""Safeguards?""

""Yeah, like... Well... Riot shields...""

""I JUST told you this isn't a riot.""

""I know, I know. But if the enemy isn't coordinated, then they're basically rioting, right? And the way to counter a riot is with phalanx that uses big shields. It helps control the crowd and keeps your people from getting pulled away from the safety of your group. If your fae use this tactic, it will protect them as they attack the mob of vampires. Plus, unlike a riot, you don't have to be concerned with whether the mob lives or not.""

""Hmm... You can use large spears behind such a shield wall,"" Yulk said. ""Stick the vampires and it will be much easier to ignite them.""

""And then you won't have to rely on the arch-fae,"" Nash added with a nod.

""Hmm..."" Mumuldobran rubbed its chin.

While the King of Arch-Fae thought to itself, I thought about how ridiculous it was that I was teaching riot tactics to a mythical being. I'm not even an expert in the craft, I've just seen a few on TV and wrote a paper on it for social studies.

""How will they see to aim their spears and spells?"" the King of Arch-Fae asked.

""Clear shields would be best. Like, made of plastic..."" I trailed off, realizing what I was suggesting.

Yulk and Nash gave me a confused look.

""Well, that's not an option,"" Mumuldobran laughed. ""But... Yes, I think we can come pretty close to it. A bit of magical manipulation here, a bit of craftsmanship there...""

""You can get your forces in the rear equipped, then trade them with the ones at the front,"" I suggested. ""Is there a way to help them get organized?""

""Yes, that won't be an issue. All wylder can move as one, when we have to. It's distasteful, though, but likely necessary to survive the current situation.""

""Good. That will help make sure the fae don't get dragged away while..."" I paused, reflecting on how invested in this I was getting. ""While they take care of the enemy.""

Before I came here, reading wasn't really my main past-time, and I didn't often choose something from the isekai genre. But I've read stories about people going back in time and teaching medieval people about modern weapons and tactics. It usually goes pretty well in the stories, but there was one story that stuck out to me.

The main character taught some people who were being victimized how to fight using modern tactics, and they eventually defeated the lord that was victimizing them. Then the king of the land issued a warrant for their arrest, because they'd broken the law by going against their lord. The MC then taught the people how to make guns, and they defended themselves against the king's soldiers.

But the author didn't write it as a power fantasy. The deaths depicted were gruesome, and there was even a scene where one of the king's men begged for his life. He said he had a family, a little girl, but the villagers shot him anyway. Then, at the end of the story, the MC had begun to become tyrannical. The villagers killed him with the guns he taught them how to make.

God, look at me. I'm eighteen years old, and I'm giving advice to someone on how to wage war while worrying about divulging too much information because of a story I read when I was sixteen. The absurdity of my new life wasn't anything new to me, and I thought I'd gotten used to weird things happening. But every now and then, this odd feeling of being out of place creeps up on me.

""You might even be able to recover some of the fae that have been stolen away,"" Yulk added.

""I hope so. This entire fight hasn't sat well with me,"" Mumuldobran said, extinguishing the cigarette. ""I would especially like to know what the damned vampires are doing with my kin.""

""They're turning them into vampires,"" a feminine voice from very close behind me said.

Whirling around as quickly as I could, I barely caught a glimpse of what looked like arms before my face was covered in warm, squishy flesh. I struggled, both to free myself and to breathe, but the arms were locked around my head like vice-grips. Briefly, I considered biting, but decided against it because it might think I'm flirting.

""SO good to see you again, Nick,"" Tits said. ""I knew I smelled you!""

""MMMMPH!"" I replied.

""Tits, let go of the human,"" Mumuldobran said with an exasperated sigh.

With a sad whine, Tits released my head. Gasping, I took a few steps back and eyed the arch-fae warily.

""Good. Thank you,"" Mumuldobran continued. ""So... The fuck?""

**Peter Pizzeria: Nottingham‚Äôs Answer to Proper Pizza**¬†üçï

If you‚Äôre after a slice that‚Äôll make you question every sad supermarket pizza you‚Äôve ever eaten, Peter Pizzeria has you covered. They‚Äôve been quietly (well, not that quietly) serving up Neapolitan pizza in Nottingham since August and let‚Äôs just say it‚Äôs already become a go-to for anyone who takes their dough seriously.

* Say Hello to Antony‚Äôs Little Friend (¬£13.50): A punchy combo of nduja, guanciale, Bella Lodi, basil, and strianese tomatoes. It‚Äôs spicy, meaty, and basically what dreams are made of.
* The Old 3 (¬£13.00): Ricotta, salami fennel, pistachio, and a drizzle of truffle oil. Fancy enough to make you feel posh but hearty enough to keep you full.
* Something Fishy (¬£12.50): Tuna, red onion, and black olives come together to prove fish on pizza doesn‚Äôt have to be controversial.
* Leave Meat Alone II ‚ÄòThe Sequel‚Äô (¬£12.50, Ve): Roasted peppers, aubergine, and vegan mozzarella ‚Äì plant-based perfection for the herbivores among us.

**Sickle Cell Society Awareness Pop-Up: A Cause That Counts**

Let‚Äôs talk about something that truly matters: The Sickle Cell Society is taking centre stage at Nottingham Contemporary, and they‚Äôre here to raise awareness about a condition that doesn‚Äôt get nearly enough spotlight ‚Äì sickle cell anaemia.

The Sickle Cell Society is the only national charity in the UK dedicated to improving the lives of those living with this genetic blood disorder. From advocating for quality care to recruiting blood donors, their work is vital for the UK's 15,000+ people affected by sickle cell. At this pop-up, you‚Äôll get a chance to learn about their¬†*‚ÄòGive Blood, Spread Love, England‚Äô*¬†campaign, which focuses on increasing ethnically matched blood donations ‚Äì a lifeline for those with sickle cell anaemia.

This is more than an awareness event; it‚Äôs a call to action. The Society‚Äôs team will be on hand to explain how you can support their work, whether by spreading the word, signing up as a blood donor, or simply learning more about the condition.

Let‚Äôs spread the love and awareness this Wednesday. It‚Äôs a small step with a big impact ‚Äì be there to make it count.

The Chelsea studio I‚Äôve seen is 5 minutes walking to my office and close to many popular bars and restaurants. It‚Äôs also a good size and has good views, good sunlight, an elevator and a well maintained lobby. 

However, 
1) The closet space is VERY small and 
2) No gym in the building, and since I‚Äôve decided to put a lot of effort into fitness, I have thought of getting gym membership at one of the Chelsea gyms. I am unsure how things would work out when it‚Äôs snowing in Jan and Feb. I prefer not to miss out on workouts during the winters. 
3) The studio was listed for an absurd amount of time (150 days) 
4) No rooftop in building which means no third spaces/lounges for hanging out on my own, if I get tired of staying inside the studio. Coffee shops can be crowded and small. Other places have no laptop policies especially if I‚Äôm working on the weekend.

# HOUSE OF THE WEEK

**A Modern Family Escape on Stafford Drive**

**Price**: Offers Over ¬£450,000  
**Location**: Littleover, Derby, DE23  
**Bedrooms**: 4  
**Bathrooms**: 2  
**Contact Agent:**¬†Frank Innes - 01332 215488

If ""family-friendly"" was a house, this modern four-bedroom detached property in Littleover would be it. Spacious, stylish, and designed for both functionality and comfort, this home is a true crowd-pleaser. Let‚Äôs dive into why this might just be the dream pad for your growing brood.

**The Ground Floor:**

Step into a wide, welcoming hallway that leads you to a lounge with all the cosy vibes. Think French doors opening to the garden and a gas log burner that practically begs for a good book and a cuppa. If you fancy a separate retreat, there‚Äôs also a versatile second reception room ‚Äì perfect as a playroom, home office, or a sneaky adult hideaway. But the real heart of the home is the family dining kitchen. With integral appliances galore (yes, including a dishwasher and fridge-freezer), plenty of light, and space for gatherings, this is where meals and memories are made.

**The Upstairs:**

Four double bedrooms mean no squabbling over who gets the bigger room (finally!). The master boasts its own en-suite for a little slice of privacy, while the family bathroom, complete with a shower-over-bath setup, is ready to tackle the morning rush.

**The Garden & Beyond:**

The enclosed rear garden is a mix of lawn and patio‚Äîideal for summer BBQs or letting the kids run wild. There‚Äôs a driveway for two cars and a detached brick-built garage for all your storage or DIY projects.

**Key Features:**

* Four Double Bedrooms ‚Äì No more arguing over who gets the biggest room.
* Family Dining Kitchen ‚Äì The heart of the home with integrated appliances and plenty of space for family meals.
* Two Reception Rooms ‚Äì A lounge with French doors and a cosy gas log burner, plus a second flexible room for whatever you need it to be.
* Master En-Suite ‚Äì Your private retreat, complete with a shower room.
* Enclosed Rear Garden ‚Äì Perfect for BBQs, kids, and peaceful summer evenings.
* Driveway & Detached Garage ‚Äì Off-road parking for two cars and plenty of storage space.
* No Upward Chain ‚Äì A smoother, quicker purchase process awaits.
* Convenient Location ‚Äì Easy access to the A38 and A50, and close to local amenities

**Why It Stands Out:**

No upward chain (hello, faster moving!), a location with easy access to the A38 and A50 for commuters, and enough space to cater to all stages of family life. Plus, did we mention the lounge has window shutters? It‚Äôs the little details that make a big difference.

This home offers a brilliant blend of modern living and family practicality. If you‚Äôre after space, comfort, and a touch of style, you‚Äôll definitely want to book a viewing.

Would it be advisable to drink redbull to maximise my focus and attention during the exam ? 

I've decided to test this out in mock tests and see how it goes. Following this, I have another concern, will redbull f*ck my sleep ? I can't really afford to have insomnia before that important exam. I just want myself to be at my peak during the exam.


TLDR: Never tried redbull. Planning on indulging in it just for a really important exam in order to be at my peak. Is it a good decision ? I'm also thinking about trying it during mocks right now, will it have a noticeable effect on my sleep ?",1,1731926110.0,redbull,4,1.0,False
