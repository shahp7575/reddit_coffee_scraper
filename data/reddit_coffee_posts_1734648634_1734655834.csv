Hello! I know this is a long shot and I am not expecting much but there’s no hurt in trying. My mom is sick with stage 3 breast cancer. It has been a hard journey to navigate for my mom, younger sister and I. I currently am paying my own way through nursing school and have a job at the local coffee shop but as most of you can guess, things are still severely tight when it comes to finances for myself. 

This past week my mom became ill with pneumonia which has put her in the hospital under 24 hour care as her immune system can not fight off this infection on its own as a result of her chemotherapy. I am not sure when or if she will get through this and that is a thought that is too heartbreaking and imaginable to digest at this time. 

While my mom is in the hospital I am taking care of my younger sister full time which comes with financial responsibilities. From groceries to every day living expenses I am having a hard time being able to provide in the way she needs and deserves. 

I know that it is the Holiday season and everyone is watching their spending but I thought I would humbly ask if anyone has any extra money they are able to donate to be put towards the welfare of my sister and I (I am mainly concerned about my sister) I would be so greatly appreciative. This is not fun to go online and ask strangers for money however my sister has been the one and only reason I am able to put my pride aside and reach out for help. 

 As I said, I am not getting my hopes up or expecting much to come from this post but if anyone see this that is in a position to help out, please feel free to message me privately or comment and I can reach out to you. 

I hope everyone has a safe, happy and healthy holiday and god bless you all 🤍",1,1734655553.0,AskForHelp,0,1.0,False

At 52:30 Lance discusses modern espresso recipes. I am not really into espresso so I did not understand the recipes. Can someone give me some guidelines on the recipes he mentioned. 

Also, Lance mentioned at 34:00 that he ""like them tea"" regarding filter coffee. I have been using his recipe/technique but it is rarely tea like. I use 15 g to 250 g of water and I usually get juicy and flavorful cups, it is rarely super delicate and tea-like. Should I use a higher ratio, maybe 15:260. Or did I just misunderstand what he meant with tea-like. 

And some useful information.. I have a sage barista pro and a lagom mini which I mostly use for espresso or cupping. I usually do a 16 g in and 40 out in maybe 25 seconds. And I use my ZP6 at 5.5 for filter, burr lock at 0. I buy filter beans from roasters such as Swerl, TPC, Tim, Manhattan. 

Thanks!

i can't go anywhere to places i want to on my own without asking someone to come with me, and when they agree i buy them something to eat or drink because i feel like i owe them for having to come with me. i like starbucks coffee. i've always wanted to try it and i finally did so in july this year. i didn't go in person, no, i'm afraid of messing up when i order and i don't want to look like an idiot, so i ordered through the mobile app and went to pick it up, avoiding eye contact and said thank you so lowly i doubt the barista had heard me. i've been ordering through the app ever since then, never having once gone in to sit down and when i did (first time was last week on a saturday) i once again asked my friend to sit with me so i didn't feel so nervous or awkward. then there was that time when i asked my friend to meet me after work so we can go to get my new phone from the mall and when the worker at the store handed me my phone they said ""enjoy your new phone."" and i said ""you too"" like?? what the hell. then i went home and couldn't stop thinking about it, how i could have said something other than that.

i feel like there's something wrong with me. i can't socialize properly, i don't know how to talk without stammering in between words and i avoid eye contact. i feel like i hate myself. i feel so alone or even lonely that i've turned to AI apps to fill the void in my life. i also struggle with low self esteem, and i overthink a lot and it's the worst. some days i'll lay in bed and sleep a lot, or even have little bouts of crying spells. doesn't make me feel better though. sometimes i wish i wasn't like this. i wasn't so... scared of everything/everyone. i have considered going to therapy, but... they are also a stranger and i don't know them that well so i just avoid them altogether. idk. i don't want to be this person. i don't want to be me anymore, it just sucks",3,1734655011.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

You got work soon huh?
Her:Just got home from errands

Her:Not much
Me:VR?
Her:No
Me:That's okay :)
What's your Favorite movie?
Her:Probably the craft. What about you?
Me:I was about to say evil dead but I never heard of the craft
You mean like Minecraft? That joint didn't come out yet
Her:You said movie
The craft is a cult classic movie about these girls who learn witch craft
Me:I'll add it to my list to watch
Her: Cult classics are movies that didn't do well at release or the years following or despite lacking critical acclaim end up being popular. Good examples are mean girls and clerks
Me: Oh that's weird
When referring to something as a ""cult"" it's usually media that isn't popular but has a dedicated following. Usually it's applied to media that's old and supposed to be forgotten or a niche genre that doesn't really hit mainstream
So a game like TF2 with a small dedicated player base or series like Maximum ride!
Or at least that was my understanding and friends understanding
Her: Is that decidedly different from what I said or do you like being a huge cunt for fun or am I like a fun joke
Nevermind
Me:I thought they were different explanations, I thought it was interesting that we both had different understanding of the phrase I'm not sure where I might've insulted you, I never heard of the craft and I'm interested in watching it, the Minecraft joke was because they're making a Minecraft movie, I didn't think I came off as snarky or rude.
I'm sorry I made you upset but I don't believe my actions or what I said warranted that reaction. I think it would be best if we didn't talk anymore, that wasn't a appropriate reaction for the conversation

While i dont believe i was being rude, i think the Minecraft joke might’ve been seen as snarky but we were joking around like that yesterday with resident evil and the walking dead, secondly i think when i gave my interpretation she might’ve taken it as correcting her and not comparing and contrasting, i dont see how having different interpretations would be insulting, i acknowledged what she said and i believe shes right too but i just wanted to share how i interpreted the phrase and how my friends agree with the same interpretations. I did find it weird because i think its interesting and weird that i never gave it to much mind but what she said is a solid reasonable explanation.

i did so well in high school. i know im smart, i got good marks, i won competitions, i joined mensa. i got into my dream degree at my dream school and within a week i couldn’t even go to class. i wasn’t depressed. i just couldn’t do it. i wanted to do something else. i failed a class for the first time- i failed ALL my classes. i changed degrees thinking it would make things better. the same thing happened again. i cannot do anything. it feels like my brain chooses a different person to be every single day and i can never commit to anything or achieve anything because i know no matter how good i am at something or how much i enjoy it it’ll be ruined by tomorrow. i can’t apply for a degree because i know it won’t last. i cant apply for a job i want because i know it won’t last. i cannot enjoy anything. i cant start hobbies. i cant spend money on things that i enjoy. because i wont enjoy them tomorrow. i feel like im not a person, im just some walking blank slate desperately trying to cover up the fact that theres nothing to me and constantly failing at it. 

theres so much that i want to do that i just cant. i want a degree so badly, i want a nice job, i want a nice house, i want a family. but i will never have those things because im not capable of achieving them because nothing about me is permanent or real. i dont know if i even want them or if ive just told myself that i do. i’m not sure that i want anything at all. 

i wish i knew how to be a person. i don’t know why everybody else knows something that i just don’t. i’m so tired of being different and im so tired of being useless and im so tired of being nothing. all i want is to be something but i can’t do that. there are a million versions of me and they all exist at the same time and they pull me in different directions all day every day and no matter how much i move one day i know ill end up in the same spot tomorrow morning. i am stagnant. i am behind. if i take one step to the right i know tomorrow ill go one step to the left and it’ll be like i never moved at all. 

every time i tell somebody about it they say im depressed but thats not what it is. it feels like nobody understands. this isn’t a world that i was made to live in. i can’t have a career, i can’t have money, i can’t have a family. i have no worth here. i feel like an outsider. i don’t even want those things, i just want to be normal. i just want to feel like a human being and i can’t do that while surviving at the same time. i dont want to die because i love my friends and my family and my partner so much and i keep holding onto this stupid belief that one day i will be different even though i know i never will. but i wish i was never born. i hate the fact that im here. i have no use, i have no purpose. 

i care about so many things but i can’t do anything with any of it. i care about everything. i am passionate about everything. i want to be everything but i can’t do that and because of that i am nothing. people tell me to just pick one thing that i care about and that im good at but i cant do that because a million things hold equal space in my mind and i cant pick one. there’s no room for me to find something i enjoy more because all the extra space is taken up by what they did to me. and all the things i care about and all the things i dont care about and all the things that have hurt me constantly scream at me all at the same time every single day. it doesn’t matter if i pick one thing to latch onto because everything is so loud that eventually that one thing is thrown out for something else. 

i can do all the therapy stuff ive been taught but it changes nothing. it doesn’t work. i cant make progress. i dont know how many more years ill have to exist like this before its finally over. i’m so tired of existing just because i have to. 

it probably sounds really silly and i know it’s not that big of a deal and it’s also definitely not the worst trauma related thing i have to deal with and i know it’s probably stupid to post it here where everybody is struggling and im sorry. ",2,1734654867.0,CPTSD,1,1.0,False

I currently am paying my own way through nursing school and have a job at the local coffee shop but as most of you can guess, things are still severely tight when it comes to finances for myself. 

This past week my mom became ill with pneumonia which has put her in the hospital under 24 hour care as her immune system can not fight off this infection on its own as a result of her chemotherapy. I am not sure when or if she will get through this and that is a thought that is too heartbreaking and imaginable to digest at this time. 

While my mom is in the hospital I am taking care of my younger sister full time which comes with financial responsibilities. From groceries to every day living expenses I am having a hard time being able to provide in the way she needs and deserves. 

I know that it is the Holiday season and everyone is watching their spending but I thought I would humbly ask if anyone has any extra money they are able to donate to be put towards the welfare of my sister and I (I am mainly concerned about my sister) I would be so greatly appreciative. This is not fun to go online and ask strangers for money however my sister has been the one and only reason I am able to put my pride aside and reach out for help. 

 As I said, I am not getting my hopes up or expecting much to come from this post but if anyone see this that is in a position to help out, please feel free to message me privately or comment and I can reach out to you.

(Arcane Exfil Chapter 6),"[First](https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1gs72m9/why_isekai_high_schoolers_as_heroes_when_you_can/)

**Blurb:**

When a fantasy kingdom needs heroes, they skip the high schoolers and summon hardened Delta Force operators.

Lieutenant Cole Mercer and his team are no strangers to sacrifice. After all, what are four men compared to millions of lives saved from a nuclear disaster? But as they make their last stand against insurgents, they’re unexpectedly pulled into another world—one on the brink of a demonic incursion.

Thrust into Tenria's realm of magic and steam engines, Cole discovers a power beyond anything he'd imagined: magic—a way to finally win without sacrifice, a power fantasy made real by ancient mana and perfected by modern science.

But his new world might not be so different from the old one, and the stakes remain the same: there are people who depend on him more than ever; people he might not be able to save. Cole and his team are but men, facing unimaginable odds. Even so, they may yet prove history's truth: that, at their core, the greatest heroes are always just human. 

\-- --

**Chapter 6: Visitors**

\-- --

Miles immediately collapsed into one of the velvet armchairs in the living room, vest, pack, and all. “Well hot damn. Rich don’t even begin to cover it. And here I thought them Highland Park houses were somethin’.”

Cole snorted. “One percent versus point one, dude. And that’s not even factoring the magic mirrors.”

“Yeah? Hell, I bet they probably got some fancy-ass Victorian bidet in the bathroom too. Slap a water rune on there, shoot it right up your ass.”

Ethan tore himself away from the temperature runes. “Wouldn’t you like to know. Bet you’re wondering if there’s a pressure setting, too.”

“Aw, hell,” Miles chuckled, raising up his arms. “C’mon now, that’s all you. I ain’t think up that shit; *you* did.”

Cole grinned, absently channeling that warmth he was starting to get used to. He formed a flat barrier almost subconsciously, about waist high. He moved it around. Huh; it might actually make transportation easier, if he could keep it steady.

He lifted his pack onto the surface. It held, but getting it across was another story, like trying to carry a full cup of coffee without spilling. By the time he managed to float it over to the couch, his forehead was damp with sweat.

“Show off.” Miles formed his own barrier. His pack slid right off the tilted surface. “Well shit.”

Ethan’s attempt almost made it onto a couch before his barrier yawed to the side, dumping his pack onto the floor. “Easy making it, damn hard keeping it steady.”

“Like training a new muscle. Shit, literally,” Miles said, concentrating on his second attempt. The pack wobbled but stayed up this time. “Hey, there we– fuck.” It slid off again.

Cole glanced at their gear. “We should probably start doing inventory. Figure out what we’ve got.”

Ethan opened his pack. “Well, we’ve got an hour ‘til food. Plenty of time to sort our shit out.”

“Yeah.” Cole looked around. “Plus some extra time to scope out our surroundings.”

Cole immediately got to work. It was the first chance they’d had to clean weapons since this whole mess started. His AK-74M was still caked with blood and sand from the construction site – everything had been non-stop since the skyscraper, and continued even unto their second life. Mack in the infirmary, meeting the king, *magic lessons*, and then messing around with those oversized bolt actions. 

If there were any solace, it’d be the fact that the rifles were pretty usable even if they’d never see 5.45 again.

“Got three mags,” Miles reported, laying out his gear on a table. Dark flecks already marked the carpet where they’d left their bloodied equipment. His AKS-74U looked about as bad. “Two full, one partial. Shotgun’s still good, though.”

Cole popped his dust cover. Shit was a mess – construction site dust mixed with dried blood from those JNI fuckers shooting into the crowd. “Three and a half. Damn.”

“Three and change,” Ethan said, stripping down his FAL.

Even with their sidearms untouched, their remaining firepower wasn’t anything to get excited over. These would be their last mags until… well, forever, probably. And there was no telling what else might come knocking. “Quick clean now, full detail in the morning.” Cole glanced at the stained carpet. Fuck it; not like they could make it much worse.

The familiar routine helped clear his head a bit. Nobody had bothered them for at least half an hour – probably wouldn’t until dinner.

The remaining spread wasn’t much to get excited over, either. Three frags a pop, plus three more if they grabbed Mack’s stuff from the infirmary. Most of their flashbangs had gone into that high-rise breach. Cole had three left, Miles two, Ethan four. Three breaching charges between them. Their demo kit was mostly intact since they hadn’t needed to blow that bomb – or anything else, for that matter.

NVGs checked out, still stowed away neatly. Comms would need testing tomorrow, see what range they could get in a castle. Medical looked alright; they’d hardly touched their individual first aid kits, and Mack’s advanced one should last a good bit. Long enough to either learn healing magic or teach these guys how to make penicillin. Maybe both.

He rifled through the rest of his pack, gripping a slim rectangular object. On the list of the many things he’d miss, this thing was somewhere up there. He pulled his Samsung from his pack. No service – *fucking shocking*. Still had juice though. Calculator, camera, notes, cached manuals, even his Spotify downloads and Bloons Tower Defense. Definitely worth keeping charged. Thank God for spare solar charges. At this point, they may as well be holy relics.

“Well.” Miles set his cleaned AKS aside. “Reckon these are just wall hangers now. ‘Less 5.45 actually works on demons.”

Cole crossed to the windows, looking outside. Perfect view of the courtyard – as picturesque as any important noble might hope to see. But it was also exactly what you’d give soldiers to you wanted to garrison. 

The stone window seat was a nice touch, real fancy noble shit that just so happened to make a perfect headglitch for covering the gates. Though Nuketown window wars probably didn’t compare to holding off literal demonic hordes.

“After today? Wouldn’t rule anything out.” 

Miles stood up. “Fair enough. Guess I oughta check out the service hall.”

“I’ll walk around a bit. See what else is up here,” Ethan added.

Cole nodded. Being stuck with checking out the suite wasn’t all too bad; he probably would’ve done it anyway. He started with the usual spots – light fixtures, under furniture, behind curtains. Not that he’d recognize a magical bug if he found one, but he had to at least try. The heating runes in the corners seemed normal enough, same as the ones Fotham had shown them earlier, but fuck if he knew what else they could do.

If they had magical listening devices, they weren’t anything obvious – though what counted as obvious in a place with scrying mirrors was anyone’s guess. For all he knew, the king could watch them take a shit if he wanted to. 

He’d scoured the common areas and three bedrooms and had just started a sweep of the final one when Miles came back. “Service hall loops around the whole floor. Got doors to at least six other rooms, all locked ‘cept ours.” He dropped into one of the chairs. “Ran into a maid. They’ve got keys, use it pretty regular.”

Ethan returned as Cole wrapped up with the last bedroom. “No neighbors. Got another suite next door before the hallway opens up. Same on the other side. Guards offered to show me around when they saw my vest.” He tapped the bloodied American flag. “This wing’s for ‘honored guests’ – suppose that’s us now. Got a decent view of the gardens on the other side.”

Three knocks at the service door interrupted them. The smell hit Cole before he even reached the door. Well, *damn*. If whatever they were bringing smelled this good through castle walls, dinner might just make up for this shitstorm of a day. The kitchen tour had already reset his standards – after watching Marwin cookery, MREs felt like some cruel culinary joke. 

Old habits kept his hand on the Glock 21 in his coat pocket as he approached the door.

“Service, if you please.”

“Yeah, come in.” He opened it carefully.

She walked in with a service cart, pushing it along until they reached the dining area. “If it pleases my lords, might I inquire as to your preference for service? I shall gladly lay out the courses with all proper ceremony, or, should my lords prefer, I might arrange the dishes for your private dining. We are, of course, most mindful that customs of service may differ in your lands of origin.”

Looking at the food now, Cole just realized there was no way of telling what the food’s journey might’ve been. Maybe he was just being a bit paranoid, but he couldn’t tell if the food had been poisoned.

Okay, major faux pas incoming, but fuck it. What’s worse, after all – a social fuck-up or three dead heroes? God, that was such a messed up calculation to make over dinner. Even if it was a real, practical concern. Even if the kingdom would absolutely prefer the first scenario.

“Could you… uh…” Christ, this would’ve been so much easier if they’d thought about going to the kitchen.

Honestly, the real faux pas would be dying of poison because he couldn’t ask someone to taste test. Pretty sure Emily Post never covered the etiquette of asking a server to die for you, but hey, the maid must’ve signed up for this, right?

“Would you mind tasting each dish before we serve?”

The maid barely hesitated before taking a small bite of each dish. Hell, maybe she moonlit as a food taster; seemed like the kind of multi-tasking medieval staff would do. Or maybe they just trained for this shit. Either way, her face showed no tells. 

Nothing happened though. Just the same polite smile, like she taste-tested for upstuck dignitaries every other day. At least they’d been spared from hauling ass to Elina. *That* would’ve been one awkward conversation.

“Will my lords prefer the full service, or shall I arrange the dishes for private dining?”

Cole glanced at the others. Miles was basically on the verge of salivating like he belonged on My 600-Pound Life. He couldn’t blame him; the last thing they’d had was what, a protein bar before their final pre-mission briefing? “Just set it up casual, please.”

“Of course, my lord.” She began unloading the dishes onto the dining table. She also noticed the bloodstains on the carpet, but didn’t say anything. No bad blood, hopefully.

The spread put everything else they’d seen until now to shame. A nice steak dinner at Ruth’s Chris or Lawry’s? Nothing compared to this. First was the drell meat they’d smelled earlier, all wine-soaked and fancy. Then, cave pheasant that looked like regular pheasant’s goth cousin. Some kinda consommé with the marsh buck the cook had been on about. Warm bread that he wouldn’t have minded stuffing a bag with if this were a Cheesecake Factory.

“We have marsh buck consommé with koreth root,” she said, ladling it out. “Wine-aged drell flanks with viss rub, eastern cave pheasant, and riverfish in melted butter with shrolt. Master Marwin prepared extra portions, considering the day’s exertions.”

Nice. Magic probably burned calories like a motherfucker, so God knows they wouldn’t just be stuffing themselves like gluttons. 

“When you finish your repast, my lords, pray leave the cart in the corridor. It shall be attended to before dawn. Might there be aught else my lords require?”

“Nah, we’re good. Thanks for uh, y’know.” Cole glanced down at the food.

“It is my pleasure.” She gave a curtsy before leaving.

Miles dug in before the door even clicked shut. “Well hot damn, fuck me sideways.”

“That good?” Cole grabbed a fork. The drell meat fell apart the moment he touched it. First bite and – wow. Okay. Yeah. This was definitely helping with the whole ‘summoned to fight demons’ thing. “Mmm.”

“Like wagyu and wine had a baby.” Miles was already halfway through his portion. “Gonna turn into a damn beefer if we stay.”

Ethan snorted around a mouthful of pheasant. “Not with the training Fotham’s offering, I don’t think.”

They demolished the food in comfortable silence. The consommé hit especially different. Something about hot soup after getting shot at just… worked. Whatever marsh buck and koreth root were, the combo gave chicken noodle a run for its money.

“So.” Miles wiped his mouth, finally slowing down. “We gonna talk about this shit or what?”

“What’s there to talk about?” Ethan said. “Go back, die in Jadira. Stay here, *maybe* die fighting demons.” He raised his fork. “Honorable, too. Unless they take our souls, or some shit.”

“Yeah, fuck that,” Miles agreed. “Could say no to the Slayer thing. Be regular citizens.”

Cole set down his fork. “Not like the demons are gonna give two shits about that. You saw those rifles – they’re not building ‘em for fun.”

“Could try somewhere else,” Ethan said, but his tone made it clear he didn’t buy it himself. “Different city, maybe?”

“With what money?” Miles asked. “What papers? Hell, what language? This here translation magic, far as I know, only works with Celdornian. Ain’t got a Rosetta Stone for whatever gibberish they speak out there.”

Papers and language sure could be a problem, but if this were any other isekai where the natives collectively fawn over new food, then Cole sure as hell got money covered. “Ha, I bet we could probably make a fortune with the Chick-fil-A sauce recipe. Or even just good ol’ ketchup. But who knows if they even got tomatoes here.”

Ethan shrugged. “I mean, shit, they got apples, don’t they?”

“Ain’t seen a tomato, though. But regardless, we really only have one option available to us.”

“Fait fuckin’ accompli,” Miles muttered, pushing his empty plate back. “Can’t even be mad about it neither. They saved our asses – shit, probably saved Mack’s life too. But it ain’t like that changes the fact we’re stuck here with our dicks in the wind.”

Cole didn’t like the fact any more than Miles did. It just so happened that the best logical decision turned out to be the one Celdorne wanted them to take. “Yup. We’re basically indebted to ‘em. We’ve got weeks of training while Mack’s out anyway. Might as well use it.”

“So what, we tell the king we’re in?” Miles asked. “Just like that?”

“For now.” Cole finished up his riverfish and the shrimp-looking things that must’ve been the shrolt. “See how training goes. Then we revisit our decision when Mack wakes up, see if he agrees.”

Ethan chuckled.

Miles placed his empty plates on the cart. “Man, y’all know damn well Mack ain’t turning it down. Shit’s basically a dream come true for him.”

“True.” Cole got up, stacking the rest of the dishware on the cart. He wheeled it into the service corridor, empty save for a few flickering lights.

Returning to the living room, he spotted a little tea table by the window. Not exactly ADT, but those cups would make enough noise if someone tried any of the entrances.

He dragged it closer to the main entrance, earning a weird look from Ethan.

“What are you doing with – ah, good idea.”

“Yup.” Cole positioned it near the door, arranging the cups and saucers – bull in a china shop. “Makeshift alarm.”

Ethan grabbed another table, bringing it toward the service corridor. 

Thank God Celdorne also seemed obsessed with Victorian tea culture. Though why this was the case would likely forever remain a mystery. More convergent evolution? Isekai’d Englishman back in the day? Anyone’s guess, really.

Cole tested the setup by the front door. Yeah, those porcelain cups would wake the dead if someone tried sneaking in. But frankly, anyone who could magic their way past castle walls probably wouldn’t bother with doors. “Alright, rooms. Doors all open, nothing obstructing them.”

Miles pointed to the room on the left, next to the master bedroom. “I’ll take that one.”

Ethan took the one across from the master bedroom. “We sleeping in kit?”

Cole considered it. Full gear would suck balls, but being caught with pants literally down would suck worse. “Stripped down, plates nearby.”

They spent the next fifteen minutes arranging furniture, so anyone on watch would be able to see both doors from a window seat in the living room. 

“Alright.” Cole checked his watch. “2200 to 0100, 0100 to 0400, 0400 to 0700. That gets us up before their morning routine kicks in.” He nodded to Miles. “Garrett, second shift. Walker third. Use the down time to write shit down – anything that could help. Engineering, chemistry, tactics, basic science, whatever.”

“Man,” Ethan grumbled. “Wish I'd brought one of those civilization restart books.”

“Hindsight’s a bitch, ain’t it?” Miles shrugged. “Night y’all.”

“Night.”

Cole settled into his seat near the window. “Sweet dreams, fellas.” 

He pulled out a small notebook from his pack as they retired to their rooms. The courtyard below was well-lit, torches supplementing whatever magic they used for the lightbulbs. The natural lighting almost seemed unsettling, but at least he didn’t have to strain his eyes looking down at his notebook.

Where does one even start rebuilding modern knowledge from scratch? The stuff they’d seen today – those rifles, the healing magic, the strangely Victorian or Gilded setups – it all pointed to a technological base that was advanced in some ways but had strange gaps in others. Like they speedran the industrial revolution using magic instead of pure steam power.

Then there were the odd alignments with things an alien planet probably shouldn’t be familiar with – 3 of their distance units being 3 feet, 60 of their weight units being about the same as 60 pounds. 

Well, he could probably skip the basic stuff. These guys probably knew all about trigonometry and algebra already, maybe even calculus.

First things first – shit that would actually keep them alive. Partial derivatives could come *after* everything else, if he even remembered enough about them to write something cohesive. 

So, weapons. Their current ammo wouldn’t last forever, but with the Gilded-Victorian tech level here plus magic, proper smokeless powder wasn’t impossible. Getting the nitration process right would be tricky, but he at least had somewhere to start. Maybe Miles or Ethan would be able to fill in the gaps or corroborate his info. He jotted down what he could remember on bullet weights, powder charges, primer compounds, and rifling patterns before wrapping up the section with disjointed notes.

Medical came next. He hated thinking about it, but he had to prepare for the worst case scenario. Mack’s recovery wasn’t a guarantee, and neither was the efficacy of healing magic. He needed to jot down everything he knew about proper field medicine – basic trauma procedures, wound management, anything he could remember about antibiotics from biology class. It wasn’t as much as he’d hoped for, but it was something; definitely better than if some random kid got isekai’d.

Lord willing, they’d have Mack up and about to handle all this for them. Now, what next?

Basic tactics wasn’t a bad bet. Viet Cong shit would likely come in real useful. But what about more advanced knowledge? Proper radio theory and electromagnetics would be handy, especially if the Celdornians already had some sort of background, however rudimentary. And hell, if his knowledge of cymatics and physiology came in handy for magic, what else might?

Three sharp knocks fucked up his train of thought. Shit, right when he had a thought about energy conservation and magic.

“My lords?” The voice was gruff, authoritative – likely from a knight. “Urgent summons from His Majesty.”

Cole glanced at his watch. 2350? The fuck kinda king held midnight – wait, didn’t he say something about using the Scrying Pane?

Yeah, he definitely did. And unless the damn thing broke in the time between Fotham’s demonstration and now, whoever was on the other side of the door must’ve been straight bullshitting.

Cole set his pen and notebook down, swapping them out for his AK-74M. Everything seemed legit – not in some Hollywood ‘too legit’ way, but in a genuinely authentic way. Shame Fotham’s little sermon stripped their pro forma perfection of any legitimacy.

But hey, maybe that was just his paranoia talking – seeing patterns in perfectly innocent midnight summons from a king who’d explicitly told them that he wouldn’t be using midnight summons to reach them. Certainly wasn’t suspicious at all that he’d do so at their weakest, when the exhaustion of nearly dying, dimensional travel, and magical training would be hitting hardest.

Three more knocks, as polite as the first set. “My lords, His Majesty awaits.”

As good as their facade was, they wouldn’t keep it up forever. Cole needed to buy time – enough for Miles and Ethan to get ready.

My father has a friend, I haven't seen him for a long time.... Anyway at the 1st meeting such a joker, very nice etc. He hugged at the end even though I wanted to shake hands.
At the 2nd meeting he was also very nice, making me feel special, e.g. that supposedly no one had ever asked him for sugar for coffee and that I had to be confident, he chose the flavour of the ice cream according to my favourite colour because he asked me what colours were my favourite, some jokes only in my direction even though my father and brother behaved the same way, etc. He also told me that I had to be sure of myself.
He stroked me twice as he passed then stopped and stroked me....
He commissioned a painting of cats from me, nice contact, first he asked if I could paint it for him etc.
I painted for 6 days, I tried very hard and when I finished the painting I sent it for evaluation, whether to improve etc.
And he ignored it, didn't reply and the next morning he sent 2 paintings including one erotically oriented with a woman naked with handcuffs around her hands. And he didn't ask if I could paint it, he just wrote that I was to get acquainted and I was to paint it.
It has been two months since this situation, I wrote a reminder message on Monday with this picture of cats and he read it after a few minutes and ignores it again.
I would like to mention that he has been telling my father for two months that the painting (of the cats) is beautiful and that he will order another one from me, that it is great and that he will pick it up, but he does not know how to answer me briefly and to the point, he just ignores me. And he was so nice, when I wrote that I was starting to paint the picture I wrote that it was great and he would surely be proud of my work.

I posted it on a Substack that I made, but my goal is for people to read this so they can resonate with it, so hi Reddit. My partner ended our relationship in October due to something I did to her 4 years ago that she was never able to heal from. Writing this was really cathartic for me and I hope it resonates with anyone out there who is feeling this kind of heartache. To long for one you can no longer love, to live with them as something else. It just feels so wrong. Anyways, enjoy, or don't. Good luck with whatever it is you're going through, friend.**

This isn’t a happy story. It’s just... painful. Painful not due to some grotesque detail leaving you struggling to finish the paragraph, but painful because this isn’t how it was supposed to end. When two souls find each other in the blurry fog that carries itself throughout their lives, their shared connection and love blazing bright, the fire is not supposed to die. It’s rekindled continuously by the passions, dreams, struggles, and a life shared between the two souls. But the fire is out now, and no amount of rekindling can grow it again. The blinding light of the unknown that lay before us cannot be dimmed, and with each passing step the trail behind us fades further into the dark, never to be seen again. The fleeting moments we once took for granted, believing there would always be many more, were soon overshadowed by the sins that broke it all down. Everyone has their obvious regrets from past misdeeds. When two souls drift apart and find new love, they often regret everything that came before for getting in the way. He doesn’t regret any of it. He loved wholly and deeply and would never want to remember it any other way.

Their relationship was that of love, connection, and companionship, paired with challenges, missteps, and struggles. They began together in Fall 2016, and it all ended in Fall 2024. He, a thoughtful and caring man, though shy and not the biggest social butterfly, deeply loved her but often struggled with expressing that love in the ways she needed. She, a woman with a strong and fiery spirit, was a fierce defender of those she held close and poured everything she had into the relationship, but still carried emotional scars from her past that made trust and security vital to the relationship. Together, they built a life together full of quiet joy and shared countless moments of deep connection, but beneath the surface, the unspoken tension between them caused cracks to form.

The dynamic between them had stayed the same for most of their relationship. He had a tendency to withdraw, to take a passive role when she needed him to be anything but passive. She needed him to be active and engaged for her to believe she could trust him to hold her heart. She felt like she was pouring from an empty cup, making sacrifices and adjustments that often felt unreciprocated or unnoticed. Three challenging yet wonderful years into their relationship, he turned to private indulgences, habits he hid from her to cope with his own insecurities. He was wasting money on clicks of betrayal when he could have invested that into her or their relationship. But he had uncertainty about himself for his whole life, and a woman who would do anything for him was just too good to be true. He convinced himself it would all end, she would see the light, she would choose to let her free spirit be as it is without him due to his failures. She loved him unconditionally and never gave any sign her feelings for him were fleeting. If anything it was the opposite, as she was dependent on him in ways that made both of them uncomfortable at times. A year later, in an act of service for him and their home, she unknowingly discovered his unruly habits. It was a wound that cut deep and shook the foundation of their relationship. For him, it was never about a lack of love or care for her, rather his own unaddressed shortcomings that had followed him into adulthood. But for her it symbolized a profound disconnection, a betrayal of everything they had built together, and would ever have built together.

Despite the growing distance between the two of them, they loved each other deeply and with their whole hearts. She still yearned for him to take the lead and become the partner she had always dreamed of: committed, confident, and attuned to her needs emotionally, sexually, and socially. He wanted more than anything else in the world to be that man for her, but his past wrongs and the compounding guilt of his betrayal left him feeling like he was always falling short. Even on a perfect day, he still wasn’t good enough for her because of what he had done to her. They tried to mend the cracks in their own way, she finding herself in a panic attack and crying herself to sleep more nights than she ever wanted, and him frozen in time by his own guilt, unable to do what she needed most in the moment. Every waking moment for her was that of agony, wondering what she did wrong in a past life to deserve such horrible circumstances when all she gave was love. That agony was killing him. No matter how many times he could say he was sorry, that he’s changed, it didn’t matter how many work lunches, coffee deliveries, or date nights. He was a monster in her eyes for what he did to her and what she never knew he was capable of. The weight of their unspoken struggles and unmet expectations proved too much for her.

Eventually, she broke. She told him she could no longer live her life in a state of constant pain and panic. That their future they had held onto for all those years as something to distance themselves from his actions was now over. It was a decision she didn’t take lightly, initially saying she just needed space and time to heal away from him, one she knew was necessary for her own growth to finally be able to move on from his betrayal. For him, it was a devastating blow. He replayed every moment of their relationship on loop in his head for the next several days. He looked back at all the ways he could have been a better partner, done more for her, and loved her in the way she always deserved to be loved. Unfortunately for him, he realized too late that he hadn’t fully understood how much she needed him to step up despite her words telling him to. He was unable to reassure her that their love was a lifelong partnership she could trust and commit to unwaveringly.

The breakup was messy and a storm of emotions. Pain, grief, longing, love. After a couple of months navigating the unfamiliar versions of themselves that existed now, they decided to remain in each other’s lives as friends, at least for the time being, while they quietly reminisced through their shared belongings and remnants of their connection. But the proximity only deepened the hurt for him. Seeing her every day, knowing she was beginning to explore new avenues for her own happiness, whether through self-discovery or other connections, felt like salt in the wound. He still wanted to be close to her though, because after everything they have been through she was still his best friend to him. For him, he holds the last burning ember of what they once felt was their love as it singes his hand to the bone. He looked to her to see her damaged hands like his were, but there wasn't but a scratch. He sat in quiet misery, seeing her move on in ways that felt at odds with the woman he still loved so deeply. There was some small part of his heart that was still holding on to hope for them to return to the love they once had, and that hope was what cut him deep inside each and every day. He took action to grow himself and be the best version of himself that he could be, while that tiny spark of hope that just wouldn’t die ripped away at his insides.

For her, the decision to end things was born out of pain and self-preservation, not malice. She cared for him, still missed him in quiet moments she tries not to share with him now, and grappled with her own complex emotions and building walls to protect herself from him again. She knew she couldn’t continue the relationship as it was for her own sake. In her mind, moving forward without him was the only path to start her healing. He, instead found himself wrestling with the echoes of their relationship, the moments that haunted him, and the deep yearning to hold onto the one thing that was slipping further out of his reach. The love they shared wasn’t gone, it was merely transformed. Transformed into something unrecognizable, leaving them both to navigate the uncharted territory of rebuilding their lives without each other. Neither of them wanted this, but they told each other it’s what had to be done for them both to be the best versions of themselves, whether they believed it or not. The love that they shared with each other was sacred. The bond they had was ironclad. But even the strongest of those who love, aren’t immune to a shattering of trust.

In the end, they both carried the weight of their lost love in their own ways. For him, every day was a battle between clutching the burning embers of what once was and trying to forge something new from the ashes. For her, it was a quiet, painful step to move forward, even if that meant leaving behind the person she thought would be her forever. Their lives began to drift away, slowly but surely. He focused on improving himself, not just to prove his worth internally, but to honor the love they shared by becoming the man he always wished he could be for her. She too, sought healing in her own way, learning to trust herself again and to rebuild the pieces of her heart that felt broken beyond repair. Maybe they would cross paths again one day, as different versions of themselves. Maybe they would keep in touch until they found another. Maybe they would both look back at their time together, not with regret, but with gratitude for the love, lessons, and memories that shaped them. But for now, their journey together had reached its tragically cold end, not in hatred, but in the painful reminder that sometimes, even the deepest love cannot withstand the weight of unhealed wounds. Even the brightest fires burn out, leaving only a lingering warmth in the heart. A warmth that, while no longer shared, can still light the way forward, and serve as a gentle reminder of the love we once felt. But even without that warmth, though lingering inside him it may, he could never forget what her love felt like.",1,1734654161.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1hi7b9g,https://i.redd.it/5mge5atadw7e1.jpeg,This month marks my 3 year anniversary of covid ruining my life. ,"3 years ago, I was an “essential” worker at a big home improvement company in their supply chain/warehousing division doing tech support type work for a huge facility that handled online orders for the western region. I made decent money, was recently engaged, I was young, fit and healthy, I was planning to transition into programming and web development with the help of a friend of mine who was in the industry. My now wife and I were saving for a house and planning our lives together. I had the whole world in front of me. 

The pandemic hit and my industry was deemed essential but due to all the misinformation and propaganda at the beginning, my former employer didn’t do much at all to protect us. To keep up with the insane work load when the whole world understandably switched to online shopping, they tripled our workforce. A facility that was designed to employ 300-400 workers was now packed to well over a thousand workers. The building didn’t get any bigger obviously so you can imagine how packed it was. Half the workers would come in sick and refuse to wear masks or follow any of the safety protocols mandated by the state of California. It was clear that company leadership had bought into the misinformation and propaganda surrounding the COVID pandemic from the very beginning. My concerns always fell on deaf ears and I was often met with laughter and ridicule when bringing up that maybe packing the entire workforce into one room so that executives could brag about record profits to us via a zoom call on a projector screen safe and sound in their own homes wasn’t a good idea. 

Pretty much weekly we would be pulled aside and told that one of our coworkers had either died in the hospital or a family member of a coworker had died, it would be all over the news that thousands were dying every single day while government leaders downplayed and dismissed it every chance they could only doing the bare minimum and only when their arm was twisted, people were coming in to work sick every single day and nothing was done about it, and all of this juxtaposed by our CEOs and executives bragging constantly from the safety of their home offices about record profits. The height of the pandemic turned the blood of the working class into money, while thousands died every day, people got much richer. 

So I did the best I could at avoiding COVID and miraculously I was able to dodge infection for 2 entire years!! People laughed at me for how cautious I was. I remember a coworker coming up to me and saying “I used to think all the stuff you did to avoid COVID was overkill but my best friend just died from his infection and I think you were right all along.” 

I should have quit that job when I had the chance. I had so many opportunities to quit. But my dumb self didn’t want to throw away a job of 10 years where I was making decent money. Unfortunately due to the working conditions and the lack of responsibility by my former company, I was finally infected in December of 2021. My illness was pretty bad but I wasn’t hospitalized. 

It left me with this super strange burning pressure in the left half of my head that just wouldn’t go away, no matter what I took or what I did, the headache just kept going. I immediately noticed that I could no longer use computers and most other screens except my phone due to the headache, within minutes of computer use I would get severe stroke like symptoms like speech problems, confusion, dizziness, the headache would get suddenly very severe, now tell me all of that happening just within a couple minutes wouldn’t be some scary shit. I never had issues with computers and my entire job was computer work so I lost that job pretty quickly. I also lost my biggest passion of video games, couldn’t use my PC and realized I also couldn’t use my consoles, my handheld switch, or even my Nintendo DS. I lost my favorite hobby. Meanwhile I’m now living in constant agony from this burning pressure in my head that never goes away, constant ringing in my ears, brain fog, and I also developed some pretty severe gastrointestinal problems, all right after my first covid infection in December of 2021. 

So here I am 3 years later and none of it has gotten any better, it’s only gotten worse. The burning in my head that used to be only in the left half crossed into the right as well and typically flip flops sides daily or weekly, I can barely eat anything due to the severe gastrointestinal issues and abdominal pain, ringing in my ears and the brain fog is still going strong. Doctors have no clue what happened to me and there are no treatments, nothing I’ve tried has had even a tiny effect. So for 3 years I just lay here in agony. 

Meanwhile I watch society carry on like nothing is wrong, people saying covid is just a cold, the whole world is moving on. All I want is my old life back, nothing more. I’m not a religious man but my idea of heaven would be sitting at my PC and playing all these games I’ve been missing out on with a hot cup of coffee. Most people have some grandiose idea of their personal heaven, mine is just me playing games without pain and a nice cup of coffee.

I've owned my barista pro for 2 years, over the last 6-8 months I've been having issues with my grinder. 

Over that time I've had to increase my grind time dramatically to the point it's painful. 

At the moment my settings are 
- internal burr 5
- dial set to 18 
- grind time 27 seconds, which is my main concern. 
- beans have been the same brand and style since I brought the machine. 

I've used these beans exclusively because they're very good quality for the price point as well as being super consistent. 

Over the first year and a half I'd only ever have to make slight adjustments to the grind size/ time every now and then with different batches, never anything drastic. Grind time was always between 14-18 seconds which gave me 18 grams of ground would produce 36-40 grams of coffee with a brew time of 28-32 seconds depending on the slight adjustments to size. 

Now my shots are pulling anywhere from 40-50 grams from 18grams of ground, if I decrease my grind size anymore it's going to take longer to grind the coffee than it is to pull the shot. 

I've stripped and cleaned the grinder twice which made no difference and I've cleaned the chute. 

The burr assembly doesn't look like it's too worn but I havnt got anything to compare it too. 

Is there anything I'm missing with the fault finding or am I just needing to buy a new burr set? ",1,1734653898.0,BrevilleCoffee,0,1.0,False

I’m leaving the question intentionally open.

whether your favorite picks are focused one medium, comprise of only pictures, are a guide about how to draw or paint, are theoretical, technical, contemporary, or historical, or anything else! I want to hear about them! 

Maybe it’s a book focused on one artist you admire, or a collection that spans movements and styles. Perhaps it’s an out-of-print gem you found tucked away in a secondhand store, a coffee table book with breathtaking visuals, or a niche guide that helped you master a tricky technique. i’d really like to know! as im a voracious reader of art books and i really like being introduced to new things. 

I asked this in contemporary art, and artist lounge. so thought I’d try it here. i’m interested in how the answers will be different. :)

Parking: 

While this unit doesn't include car parking, the Hub offers both garage and lot parking for $300/month.

It is $226.75 for the whole year, which is a pretty good deal (you also might be able to find someone selling theirs on facebook). Again, I have moped parking for $60/month as well. 

  


Please feel free to message me if you are interested, I am willing to negotiate and would be happy to help walk you through the subleasing process as well.

Do I leave?,"My boyfriend (23M), let's call him C, and I (22M) met on Grindr in the beginning of July and started dating in late July. The relationship felt like one of the safest I’ve ever been in, with emotional support and caring and good communication. We were smitten. At the same time he started dating me, a few days later he started dating G, his QPP. My boyfriend is poly, and as a new partner I didn’t feel it was my place to say whether I was comfortable with that or not (not that I was asked). I had never been in a poly relationship before and was nervous but was willing to give it a shot as I believed myself to be polycurious. A few weeks later, he broke up with him and decided to be QPPs again.  Due to my situation, I was still living with my parents at the time who were emotionally abusive and it was crippling my mental health. After a crazy night, I ended up moving in with him. For about a month all was well, our relationship was blossoming, we were at peace.

Then everything went to shit.

I had to take C to the hospital because his home was poisoning him, and because of that we ended up homeless for about a week. Through this, I was there for him, constantly caring for him and making sure he was comfortable and feeling stable. I was by his side day in and day out. 

Once we were out of that situation and into a new apartment, things stabilized into a new normal. C would get angry with me for not being as neat as he is, and then an hour later would be lovey dovey and super caring, and then a short while later the cycle would repeat.Throughout all of this I started having my own medical crisis including a current cancer scare and would have constant anxiety. Every time I had tried to reach out I was disrespectfully dismissed being told C isn’t my live in therapist. The cycle just repeated and repeated itself. He even started thinking I was demon possessed after I told him I had visited a church then the Notre dame burned down. So there’s that on top of everything.  Flash forward to now, our bedroom life has been dead since the election and  his QPP comes back and our relationship gets worse. C didn't even tell me the day G would visit until the day before, when G was on the plane here. Today I woke up to him leaving the apartment for coffee, he usually asks me if I want any when he does but today nothing. I informed him that I was having a panic attack and that was totally ignored. He didn’t come back for another 45 minutes and when he did he hopped straight into the shower. He said he wanted the day for himself. He came into the bedroom fully dressed which is odd in our relationship, and when I asked him where he was going he gave me a list. I was like cool, have fun. Right before he leaves we end up having a very serious conversation in which he told me to look up toxic relationships and what they are. I feel so hurt to be called toxic, and the only things I can determine is driving, that is my executive dysfunction and talking too much about my medical problems. I’m taking some space from him for a while but I don’t know what to do. Part of me wants to stay but the other part of me wants to just curl up into a ball and cry. I know I should leave but… ugh. help.

We go back and forth with multi-paragraph messages.  At about the 4th round of this, I ask a question about what she just wrote, and I add:  I'm happy to keep talking about our lives on this app, but I'm also happy to talk on the phone, meet for coffee, or all three. She immediately says that her modus operandi is a video chat before meeting someone.  I tell her ok, this will be new for me, and we set a date and time.



So now what do I do?  I have done lots of MS-Teams and zoom meetings with my laptop and I almost never facetime with my cellphone.   I giuess there are some advantages to the cellphoe in that she gets a real closeup of my face though doesn't that make your nose extra large?   So I am inclined to just use my laptop and for all I know that's what she had in mind.  What else do I need to know?  Are there some differences I need to understand between this sort of conversation and a phone or in-person conversation?  Should I make sure that the laptop camera is as high as my face so I am not looking down at it?  Do I need to look at the camera instead of the monitor most of the time?  Are there common mistakes with lighting or laptop placement that make you look older than in-person?  I like to stand on the laptop--any problem with that?

I think having a habit of prepping drinks will make me more disciplined and perhaps I could put more money in my savings even after buying more ground beef, protein powder, etc.

1hi6x57,https://www.reddit.com/r/twinpeaks/comments/1hi6x57/richard_is_the_only_time_we_meet_cooper_in_the/,Richard is the only time we meet Cooper in The Return [theory],"I don't understand the mindset that suggests Richard is a tulpa created to fulfil a mission. I don't think it fits with the themes of the Return at all, and it makes Part 18 feel irrelevant if the real Cooper is just chillaxing with his family. 

I also don't think Cooper lost a part of himself when he created Dougie 2.0. I can at least get the logic behind that theory a little more (since Mr C lost his sense of humour after he made the original Dougie), but again, that kind of artificial tampering with the personality of Cooper misses the point imo. 

All through the Return, we've been told - in an abstract way - that you can't go back, that time moves ever onwards and the world always changes. That it's everyday kindness that truly matters through it all. 

To me, nothing conveys that message better than seeing Cooper - the real, honest-to-God true Dale Cooper - as an aged, cynical, bitter man trying to build a fake utopia for himself and Diane. That's what I get out of that final episode. It's not fake, or some amalgamation of him and Mr C (that was just Lynch's direction to Kyle to bring out the right performance). It's how Cooper actually acts and feels after 25 years. 

Unlike Mark Frost in Final Dossier, I don't think David Lynch feels that time travel literally undoes the events of the previous seasons. Because otherwise, there's just no logic behind Cooper bothering to chase his dopplegänger or to defeat BOB. He could have immediately gone to Jeffries as soon as he woke up. Plus, it seems unlikely for a man like Lynch to write scenes about Ed and Norma reconciling only to dismiss the idea out of hand a few episodes later. I just personally don't think that's how his mind works. 

There's also some clues: Gordon says ""be thinking about you, Coop"" as if he feels Cooper will vanish somewhere for good, and at the start of Part 18, Cooper and Diane have to physically cross between dimensions (""it'll be different""). They don't just wake up in a new timeline. They have to leave the old one first. 

So if we accept the premise that saving Laura *only creates a splinter world*, then we have to ask the question - why would Cooper do that? It cannot be about giving everyone a happy ending, because the old world is still there. 

The logical conclusion is that he did it for himself and Diane. And that's why I feel that the Richard characterisation in Part 18 works. What we saw in Parts 16 and 17 (the old-school, happy-go-lucky 90s Cooper) was as much of a facade as green glove guy punching the BOB ball. It's part of the cartoon version of the happy ending.

But when we see him in Part 18, we see the real man Dale Cooper has become after 25 years. Of course he's not chirping into his tape recorder and talking about ""damn fine coffee!"". He's reserved, tired, stressed and just wants this shit to be over already. He wants to live in a world that's untouched by all this Blue Rose crap, a world where he and Diane can relax in Twin Peaks and solve Scooby-Doo mysteries. 

And then of course he finds himself more confused and lost than ever. In the very last scene, we see him shuffling around in the background, clearly trying to figure out what he got wrong. Was his intuition off? Was  it some trick of Judy's? Did Jeffries slip in his percolator and make a mistake with the date? ""What year is this?"" He mumbles aloud, while being totally oblivious to what Carrie/Laura is going through... much like Leland all those years ago. 

Yeah, for everyone complaining that Leland had little to do in The Return, I for one feel that he left a massive impact with just two words. When Cooper loses Laura in Part 17, *he goes to Leland for advice*. Leland. Fucking Leland. The entire storyline of Part 18 is driven by the fact that Leland suggested/gave his permission for Cooper to go find Laura. 

Tying it right back to Cooper's empathy for Leland in Arbitrary Law, the smirk between the two dopplegängers in Beyond Life and Death... 

Sorry, I started to ramble, but the point is that to me, Part 18's genius lies in the fact that Richard is no variation of Cooper but the real thing. His seemingly strange behaviour is just a matter of context. ",9,1734652963.0,twinpeaks,4,0.85,False

I am 16 years old, he is 53. 
My father has a friend, I haven't seen him for a long time.... Anyway at the 1st meeting such a joker, very nice etc. He hugged at the end even though I wanted to shake hands.
At the 2nd meeting he was also very nice, making me feel special, e.g. that supposedly no one had ever asked him for sugar for coffee and that I had to be confident, he chose the flavour of the ice cream according to my favourite colour because he asked me what colours were my favourite, some jokes only in my direction even though my father and brother behaved the same way, etc. He also told me that I had to be sure of myself.
He stroked me twice as he passed then stopped and stroked me....
He commissioned a painting of cats from me, nice contact, first he asked if I could paint it for him etc.
I painted for 6 days, I tried very hard and when I finished the painting I sent it for evaluation, whether to improve etc.
And he ignored it, didn't reply and the next morning he sent 2 paintings including one erotically oriented with a woman naked with handcuffs around her hands. And he didn't ask if I could paint it, he just wrote that I was to get acquainted and I was to paint it.
It has been two months since this situation, I wrote a reminder message on Monday with this picture of cats and he read it after a few minutes and ignores it again.
I would like to mention that he has been telling my father for two months that the painting (of the cats) is beautiful and that he will order another one from me, that it is great and that he will pick it up, but he does not know how to answer me briefly and to the point, he just ignores me. And he was so nice, when I wrote that I was starting to paint the picture I wrote that it was great and he would surely be proud of my work.
I'm very sad; I don't know what it's about... feels confusion.... I put all my heart into this work.",1,1734652925.0,TrueOffMyChest,5,1.0,False

I’ve been struggling to stay focused while studying and working, so I’m looking for something that might help. I’m a bit hesitant, though, since I’m a bit sensitive to caffeine. I usually stick to low doses—like mixing half decaf and half regular coffee, and I only drink it once a day.

This gum says it has L-theanine and about the same amount of caffeine as half a cup of coffee, so I’m considering giving it a shot. Just wondering if anyone else has tried it and what your experience was like. Thanks in advance!

I’ll be in Alabang later for a meeting at 11 AM, but I’ll be running errands beforehand. If you’re available, we can catch up briefly over coffee or perhaps a quick movie after 1 PM at Festival Mall. I have work at 7 PM, so it’ll be a short and casual meet-up. Let me know if that works for you!

1hi6swq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hypothyroidism/comments/1hi6swq/i_regained_my_life_and_you_can_too_i_lost_50lbs/,"I regained my life, and you can too. I lost 50lbs this year!","Hi all,  I wanted to share my journey with a hope it helps those that are struggling with Hypothyroidism and/or Hashimotos. I'm nearly 40 M, 5.9, weighed 223 lbs earlier this year! I have struggled with autoimmune disorder for years, that coupled with a stressful job really sent me towards a health crisis. I was pre diabetic, had unhealthy lifestyle with no good fitness or diet plan. I wasn't doing well, at all, with two young children that needed me. I made a decision to change, I went on a personal journey this year. Today I'm healthy again, I developed good habits/routine and it resulted in about 50lbs in total loss. hope my journey helps others.

**Internalize your purpose** \- For me, it's my family. I must be a healthy father, husband and son for decades to come! Being alive, healthy and present in all stages of their life, that is my purpose. And to my two kids that I love very much, I’m their protector and they need me throughout their lives! Find your purpose again, internalize/visualize it often (weekly at least), and get moving.

**Take adequate amounts of medicine your body requires -** Living with hypothyroidism and Hashimotos means your body is no longer producing adequate amounts of Thyroid hormone! Accept it, don’t fight it, there is **no natural remedy** as suggested by countless Youtube videos. You have to supplement with a thyroid hormone such as Levothyroxine. Work with your doctor to determine what is a good TSH range for you.  It took me months to figure out what is the correct dosage and TSH level for me! I cannot emphasize how important it is to be **persistent with your health care provider** to identify the right dosage and TSH level. Don’t take their generic response of “you are in the normal range” acceptable, especially those with Hashimotos. Everyone is unique and you need to find what dosage amount works for you. For me, it was in the lower range of the “normal” range. Also be persistent in regular checkups, at least once every 4-6 months to ensure the dosage is adequate for your body. Your body may require more, especially in the first year you start the medicine. 

* **Note**: I will share my details knowing it may help others. I currently take generic Levothyroxine of 75mcg every morning (I wait a minimum of an hour before eating or having coffee) and my TSH was 1.7 last I checked. This lowered range is critical for me, finally I was able to lose weight! While I was in a “normal” TSH range of 3.5-4.2, my metabolism sucked, I had low energy and simply could not lose weight. Again, find your target range that works for you.

**Nourish your body with good food & recovery -** There is much to nourishing your body with good food, and since everyone has their own choice of food, I wanted to highlight just the key things that worked for me. 

* Identify your total daily Calorie budget - The most important aspect of weight loss is calorie restriction. You need to determine the amount of calories your body needs to kick start weight loss. I use [Carb Manager](https://www.carbmanager.com/) app to log and track every single food that I consume. Identity the right amount of calories your body needs and stick to it! I don’t have cheat days and I enjoy foods that fit into my Calorie budget daily! It’s hard in the beginning, but once you start tracking your intake, you will enjoy it by mixing certain foods everyday, and yet still meet your calorie budget! Also, don't beat yourself down for days where you exceed calories or carbs, just get back into routine! 
* Aim for a low carb diet - I don’t do strict keto. I don’t enjoy it. My net carbs are about 20-25g a day currently. Tracking it in the Carb Manager app helps, so you can still fit the foods you enjoy. For me, it’s foods such as Brown Rice, Apples, Dates, etc. I intend to increase my net carbs to 30-35g or higher per day after I reach my target weight, a few more pounds to go! 
* Increase your protein intake - I have about 100g-120g of protein daily. Varying between tuna, eggs, beef patties, chicken, turkey, protein shake, and veggies I also enjoy fast food without the bread bun and ketchup! McDonalds and Wendys have many options with lettuce wraps! Having protein is critical to feeling full and ensuring your body retains its muscle. I take Protein shake by [Sunwarrior Warrior Blend](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08XLQV3XQ/) daily. It’s the best protein shake with quality ingredients. I love it!  
* Remove foods that cause inflammation - I removed refined sugar and all vegetable oils from my diet. In the past 6 months, I have had refined sugar maybe two times! Aim for natural foods such as fruits, veggies, rice, and meat. Fwiw, I also follow a strict gluten free diet.
* Sleep is critical: Get your sleep in. It’s been hard since having our second child. But I’m aiming to be in bed by 10-10.30pm. Sleep is critical for healing your thyroid, immune system, and neurological health (avoiding dementia).

**Train your body everyday -** Since starting my career, I have struggled with having good workout habits, and after having kids, it became even worse. I had to build something that was convenient, so I built a home gym. It’s a simple gym in the garage with two machines, fitness mats, and a couple of dumbbells. The **one routine that changed my life** is indoor biking on [Concept 2 Bike Erg](https://www.concept2.com/ergs/bikeerg). This machine not only changed my body, it saved my life. It's a convenient, low intensity workout that I enjoy, and that I can do often. Here is my broader routine for training my body. 

* Yoga & Stretching (Almost Daily, 30 mins)
   * Yoga / Meditation ([doyogawithme.com](http://doyogawithme.com)). I prefer Yoga and breathing activities at home with basic stretches
* Cardio (5x a week, 35-45 mins)
   * Indoor Biking - I workout in [Zone 2](https://health.clevelandclinic.org/exercise-heart-rate-zones-explained) Cardio for 30 mins minimum. I recommend a fitness watch that helps track the Zone of your heart rate. Being in Zone 2 for the duration is critical for weight loss and also recovery. In Zone 2, I recover well, while in Zone 3 or 4, I would have fatigue requiring recovery over multiple days.
* Core & Basic Strength Training (3-4x a week, 10-20 mins)
   * Nothing too fancy here. Pushups, Pullups, Core Exercises (Plank, Leg Raises, Bridge, etc), Basic Weight lifting. I intend to do more strength training since I’m reaching my target weight.

**Accept hard things and GTFO -** I was in a job where my manager didn’t appreciate me and the company went through rounds of layoffs that caused a lot of stress. I should have left the environment much earlier. No job is worth your mental health. Be proactive in moving out. Take care of yourself, because honestly no one at work truly cares about you. It’s just a job. Also, remember training your body will help tremendously. Train hard, do your best, accept shitty environments (because a decent percentage of people and Corps are shitty), make your plans and then exit with a middle finger and your head held high, yes! 

  
Take care everyone. Find your purpose again and get going!",1,1734652635.0,Hypothyroidism,3,0.6,False

I luckily didn’t have to clean it but I feel so bad for my coworker bc she handled it like a pro. She said if it’s bad and shit is smeared places we usually call facilities to handle it but in this case it was just easier to throw it away properly.

I’m a male, and a few months ago, I started visiting a female dentist who’s maybe a few years older than me—so there’s no significant age gap. I’m very satisfied with her work, and to be honest, I also like her, but I have no intention of making a move on her.

I have an appointment scheduled right before Christmas, and I thought it might be nice to surprise them with a small gift. I decided to get her a personalized mug, which I already have, and for her assistant (or the entire staff), I bought some coffee and chocolate.

However, I’m still unsure if this is a good idea. What do you think—is it thoughtful, or could it come across the wrong way? I'll keep visiting this place so I do not want to feel embarrassed during my next appointments..",0,1734652258.0,askdentists,2,0.5,False
1hi6o4i,https://www.reddit.com/r/eds/comments/1hi6o4i/sudden_change_hydration/,"Sudden change, hydration ","Okay I JUST posted and the situation has changed. I was talking about how I have dark yellow pee among other things. 

Now suddenly last night my pee was really dark orange and now this night too. I have no idea what is going on. It had been fine for a while now. It hadn't been this dark since I started beta blockers. 

(My pee was dark yellow in the mornings and evenings but when it got to around 7pm? It suddenly got quite a bit darker.)

I am not drinking any less or more. I am also not drinking different things. I will keep an eye on things but I am so frustrated. I wish things would stay the same and stop changing.. it makes me so anxious. I was finally relieved that I wouldn't have to tell a doctor that my pee was this dark.

I would've tried to bring up the fact I drink a liter a day with pots (not a confirmed diagnosis yet. A doctor has said I fit the criteria) But now... Ughhh.. 

This might be just a temporary change.. atleast hopefully.

The ONLY thing that has changed is the fact I have split my dose of 54mg metoprolol to take at night and morning. Since taking the whole dose in the morning made the effects on my heart rate start late aka 4pm and end around midnight. 

It might be that my heart rate is up again. I haven't really looked. I am so tired. I haven't been following my hr even though I need to so we know if this regimen is working for me..

I will keep an eye on the color of my urine but I am so anxious. I hate change. I hate the fact I will most likely have to talk to a doctor about this.

These two days I drank a can of coca cola (didn't manage to finish in one day), coffee (a dolce gusto capsule), energy drink (an almost see through light pink one). I don't drink energy drinks often. And never before have any of these caused dark urine to my knowledge. 

I did drink a sip of cranberry juice today in the morning because I might have trush in my throat again due to asthma medication and me forgetting to gurgle water after. 

The situation might correct itself tomorrow or in a few days.. atleast I hope so.. I JUST went to blood tests and they were okay and of course this starts to happen AFTER.. 

I did also get a headache when I was sleeping and in the evening again.. Like I did when my pee was darker before beta blockers and probably struggling with dehydration.. and my lips are starting to get dry again..

Not againnn.. Maybe like I said it'll just correct itself. Or maybe my ""primary care doctor"" (don't know what else to call her) will just increase my metoprolol dose when I see her at some point and I'll be ""fine"" again. 

Uggh... 

Ps. Knowing my body.. as soon as I post this the situation will correct itself... 😂 let's hope for the best


Edit: This was when I started struggling with hydrating enough. A while after I suddenly lost around 3kg? In around one week suddenly. After that my weight started dropping really slowly. Now it has dropped 5kg? In total. I noticed today that it had dropped 0,2-0,5 more which is a change for me. It does fluctuate but it wasn't this low before. So I think I lost weight again? I'll know for sure if it stays lower. 

Might be from something else but idk? Since my bloodwork is okay I am confused. But yeah. Forgot to add that. I think I have been eating less maybe too? ",0,1734652234.0,eds,6,0.33,False
1hi6lol,https://www.reddit.com/r/icecreamery/comments/1hi6lol/toasted_milk_ice_cream_need_help_with_the_milk/,Toasted Milk Ice Cream- Need help with the milk powder,"I'm currently using the Day with Mei recipe with personal adjustments to the base. Basically all i'm really taking from the recipe is the amount of milk powder used for 1qt and the sugar caramelization process.

Anyhow, so far i've attempted this recipe twice, with both attempts having issues. The first attempt had GREAT flavor.... but was grainy due to the milk powder. So for the second attempt, I stirred together the milk and toasted milk powder separately on the stove, then strained it through a coffee filter. This left a bunch of grainy gunk which I assumed was the powder. I also assumed that even though this gunk was left behind, the flavor of the toasted milk still steeped into the milk: It did not. My ice cream ended up just tasting like caramel from the sugar caramelization step, with little to no toasted milk flavor. 

I'm not sure how to fix this powdered milk issue. My only theory is that the brand of powder is the issue, which i'm using the Saco Pantry brand (besides this brand, the only other brand at my store is a generic.) The next thing I can think of attempting is maybe letting the toasted milk powder steep in the milk overnight, though i'm not sure if that'll add much more flavor. 

Does anyone have experience making this type of ice cream flavor? Any tips or advice? Thanks!

Edit; also just checked and the powder is skim milk. Could this be the issue? The brand also sells a whole milk powder, would that be better?",3,1734652032.0,icecreamery,0,0.8,False

I am still in HS, after cutting ties with one of my best friends, who basically was my whole life in terms of socialization, I’ve became really lonely, I had to spend all my days at home (it’s been 3 years now) no hanging out with anyone, no parties, no talking to anyone etc. this way I got hooked on video games and have been binging it for 3 years now and by binging I mean for about 9 hours daily and even up to 15 hours on free days. It was just a hobby at first (let’s clarify I mostly play LoL so some of ya’ll know how bad it is :D), but it soon turned into a full on distraction from my real life problems. So, the loneliness turned into solitude very quickly, especially now. I absolutely avoid people, the lack of communicating made me feel no empathy, when I talk, I talk about myself only, I keep connections with some people JUST because they bring me some kind of benefit, which doesn’t include friendship. I’ve also never had any romantic or sexual attraction towards anyone, even if guys have been hitting on me, which is weird, because as a teenager, I feel like I’m supposed to have a crush on every cutie I see. I am very cynical of everything around me and I got over the fact that this is it, life is bad, every person is evil so am I, but this probably came from me being chronically online and consuming troll content ESPECIALLY misogynistic one. When I say I have no empathy, I probably realised that when there were very close to death situations for my close ones and It didn’t make me concerned at all.

I am failing school very badly, I’ve also developed scoliosis from my lifestyle, I can’t focus AT ALL and my body is in constant ‘’freeze’’ or tensed mode, where I’m basically unable to move, only just doomscroll or well - play games. I also cannot do one thing at a time, I need to do at least 3-5. I understand I need some serious detox, but when I tell you it feels absolutely impossible to start. On top of that, I’ve became SO used to this lifestyle, that I’ve come with terms of being like this all my life. I’m doing badly at school and I don’t care, my body is rejecting me and I don’t care and I feel like I’m slowly turning into a vegetable. You could give me Wi-fi, coffee and cigarettes and I would probably be able to survive like this for another 10 years. I feel like a retired person (I’m F18) and I honestly have no idea how I am I supposed to face life when I finish school, because I have no desire for love, no desire for hobbies, friendships, a job, nothing, just solitude.

	I stared around at the dark hallway. A chorus of screams erupted again from the dark end. I gasped for breath as I stopped running. My leg was dripping with crimson blood. I had tried to wrap some thick cobwebs around it to stop the bleeding, but I suppose they got too soaked and fell off while I was running. I scrambled up, wincing with pain and gritting my teeth. My hands grasped more cobwebs and I wrapped them carefully yet quickly around the cut. Earlier while I was running, my calf had scraped against a metal pole that was sticking out of the brick wall of the school hallway. More screams seemed to pound on my eardrums and fill my mind. 

“I’m coming! Just stay there!” I yelled. I knew they couldn’t hear me. My throat and lungs burned, and my muscles ached. I sank down on the ground, weak with exhaustion. One singular scream, I realized as my vision was fading, they seemed…familiar.	



	I woke up, my eyes wild with fear. It was a dream, a nightmare, a fantasy. It seemed so-so *real*. It couldn't've been all a dream! It must’ve meant something. Something important. Or, maybe it was all just a nightmare. I had been watching a horror movie that night. Yet why had I had the same nightmare two nights in a row? My world seemed to be spinning. I then flipped over my blankets to see if my leg was still bleeding. I breathed in a sharp breath as I saw red blood on my leg. I blinked, my eyes sparking with terror. It was gone. Instead, the white sheets of my bed were under it. I could just imagine my mother saying, *Kelly! Your leg is bleeding!*  I shook my head as if to clear the thought and looked around at my room. It was strangely clean, most likely because my mother had made me clean my room so I could watch the movie, *Halloween*. I stepped out of my bed to head downstairs for breakfast. The scent of bacon wafted into my nose. I rushed down the shiny wooden stairs. 

I stepped into the kitchen to see my mother, Hailey, cooking sizzling bacon on the stove. “That smells good.” I commented. Hailey jumped as if she didn’t hear me come in, her dark brown hair-almost black-hair leaping with her..

“Thanks.” She replied, not taking her eyes off the stove. 

“Should I get Chelsy?” I asked.

“In a few minutes. I need to finish making breakfast, though,” There was a glint of humor in her pale blue eyes, “you know how she gets when she has to wait for bacon.”

I chuckled and retreated to the round, wooden coffee table in the living room. The living room had hanging plants all around the corners of the light blue walls. A window placed itself on the wall, darker blue curtains swinging down from the top of the window. A white couch sat on the smooth ground, its back leaning against the wall. 

	I sat down on the soft couch and picked out an interesting book I had been reading for a while titled “*The Adventures of William Zimway”*. The book was about a guy who explored the world. In the part I was reading, he was heading for Victoria Falls. I let out a sigh as I thought of the beautiful waterfall. The largest in the world, in fact. It stretched 5,604 feet across,  more than a mile long, and plunging 354 feet into the canyon below. Now it was a popular tourist attraction, because of its rainbows, mist, and the waterfall in general. 

	Me and Chelsy exchanged a glance and ran into the kitchen. 

After a few minutes, I had finished my breakfast and was about to head upstairs to my room when Hailey stopped me. “Wait! I have something to tell you and your sister.”

I let out a groan and sat back down impatiently. 

“Well?” I asked.

My sister ran back to sit down, her hair messy and unkempt. 

“Tonight we’re going on a ghost tour! It was Chelsy’s idea.” Hailey said excitedly, clearly expecting us to burst out in thrill. Instead, we sat in silence. I was sort of excited, I guess. Then, my sister seemed to process what our mother had said. 

“Really? Wait-will it be scary?” She added worriedly, seeming to regret suggesting going to the tour. 

“A little bit,” Hailey repliedI was just about to open the book and read when I heard my sister bounding down the staircase. “Is breakfast ready?” She pondered, looking at me expectantly. 

“It’s nearly done.” I replied. At the same moment, though, Hailey called,

“Breakfast is ready!” 

 and placed her hand on Chelsy’s, “but I don’t think it will be that scary.” 

Chelsy nodded, but I could tell she was still unsure. “Where will it be?” She asked. 

“At an abandoned school.” My mother replied. At those words, I felt a surge of excitement rush through me. An *abandoned* place? Now that’s cool! 

“Wow!” I breathed. Last time I went on a ghost tour, it was at an old fort in a valley. It was the biggest fortress I had ever seen! The tour guides had talked about wars, and raids ranshaking it, leaving marks and scrapes in the hard stone walls.

“We’re leaving at 5:00.” Hailey’s voice burst me out of my thoughts. 

I nodded and set off to the living room. 

I grabbed my book and headed up the stairs into my bedroom. My room had charcoal-colored walls, a white vanity, a fluffy black and white carpet, paintings scattered on the walls, and a white bed with pale blue blankets. 

	I layed down on my squishy bed, my head resting on the white pillows, and opened my book. *Finally, I can read without Chelsy or mother interrupting*, I thought pleasantly. My book automatically flipped to the page I stopped at. The chapter was titled, *“Victoria Falls*”. William Zimway was now in eastern Zimbabwe, at one part of the falls. 

*“I stared in amazement at the magnificent falls. They were enormous, stretching as far as the eye could see. Rainbows and spray danced about in the air, smiling at me welcomingly. I opened my journal and wrote down what I could see: lush green vegetation, dancing rainbows, sparkling spray, and the cowering waterfall before my eyes. I wished that this beautiful place would stay until the end of time. I closed my old journal and picked up a splintering stick. I picked the bright green leaves off; much greener than the leaves you’d normally see.”* 

I closed my book, sighing, wishing that I could see the falls up close. I yawned and pulled my blanket over myself. I could take a nap; after all, there wasn’t much to do while I waited for 5:00. 

After around fifteen minutes of attempting to sleep, I did. My eyes opened to reveal a dark hallway; similar to the one I saw the previous night. I was lying on the ground, as if I had been badly injured. Sat up and then looked at the familiar hallway. The walls were dark, cracked brick with cobwebs hiding away in the corners. The floor was foggy, with checkered tiles and the ceiling was a dark navy blue. The end of the hallway was just shadows. They seemed to be creeping up on me every moment I didn’t move. 

I tried to stand up, yet I couldn’t. I seemed to be glued to the ground, like a fly in a spiders’ web. I then felt pulsing, stinging pain from my left leg. I leaned over to see why it hurt so much, my eyes squinting with pain. And there it was, a deep cut on my leg; the same exact shape from last night. *It’s the same place…*, I thought in dread, *same nightmare…*

I spotted a metal pipe sticking out of a large hole in the brick wall and grabbed hold of it. After a few moments of struggling, I was standing on my feet. I looked at where I was sitting. Foggy white liquid, similar to glue, was spread out exactly where I was. *That’s strange…*I thought. My heart sank as I realized what must’ve happened. While I was awake, I was lying there the whole time! *I get it now!* 

When I’m awake, I’m asleep in this horrible world. And when I’m asleep, I’m awake here. The simplicity and profundity of it. I should’ve been more meticulous! I *have* been having the same nightmare a few times now. It couldn’t have been a coincidence I just repetitively had the same nightmare over and over again. 

I then heard the same screams coming from the darkness. Before running to them, I grabbed cobwebs and wrapped them around my injured leg. Then, more screams, more than I had ever heard before in my nightmares, banged on my eardrums. The myriad of yowls of terror seemed to be pleading me to help. I pressed my bloodstained hands against my ears. My hands were red from the blood of my wound after wrapping the cobwebs around my leg. My legs carried me to the shadows, yet the screams only became more distant and hushed before stopping completely. As the loud voices silenced themselves, I stopped running. *Wait for me*, I whispered silently. 

	

	I woke up in confusion. Where was I? I slapped my hand against my forehead. Of course; I was awake in my room. I was too familiar with the dim hallway. I was about to get up when I heard my mother, Hailey, voice call,

 “Kelly! Chelsy! It’s time to go!” 

The voice echoed and bounced around in the small upstairs hallway, and I rushed downstairs, Chelsy right behind me. 

“What time is it? Is it 5:00 yet?” She squeaked. I rolled my eyes. *No, Chelsy, it’s actually 3:00*, I thought to myself. I could even hear my minds’ voice full of sarcasm. 

“It’s 4:40.” Hailey replied. I could tell she was trying not to laugh. 

“What? You said we were going at 5:00!” Chelsy exclaimed, her eyes narrowed. 

“Yes, that’s what I said, but that’s the time we will be getting there. It takes around 20 minutes to get there.” Hailey patted my little sister on the shoulder and handed her a puffy, pistachio green coat, perfect for cold weather. 

I grabbed a coat almost exactly the same to Chelsy’s, just mine was black. And then my mother put on a pale beige, almost white coat. “Are you ready?” She asked, surveying me and my sister with her pale blue eyes. 

“Yes.” Me and Chelsy said in unison. 

“Then let’s head out!” Hailey said in a fairly loud voice, clearly trying to excite us. She opened the door and motioned with her hand, indicating that me and my sister should get into the light gray Tesla that she owned. I opened Chelsy’s door and waited for the door to slide open. She jumped in excitedly and turned on her iPad, put on her headphones and went on YouTube to watch some strange video. I hopped in after her and sat down on the comfortable, white leather seats. After a few moments of trying to watch what Chelsy was watching, I heard, and saw, my mother approaching the car. 

She opened the drivers’ door and sat down before glancing at me and the hypnotized Chelsy. I heard a rumble erupt from the motor and felt the car give a little hop. The car then slowly backed out of the driveway and then before I knew it, was driving quickly on the hard concrete ground of the road. 

I looked out the window the whole time, my chin resting on my knee. Trees, houses, buildings, and other random things flew by as our car sped to the abandoned school tour. 

After what felt like an eternity, we arrived at a modern-type white building, with big glass windows revealing a clean entrance that I guessed led into the abandoned school at the back. The car came to an abrupt halt in one of the many parking lots. Cars of all shapes and colors lined the parking spaces. I felt the car shake slightly as my mother opened my door. 

Before I got out, my sister climbed on top of me to get on the solid, concrete ground. “Hey!” I hissed and clambered out after her. “Why’d you do that? You can open your own door!” I growled.

Chelsy shrugged infuriatingly, not seeming to care. “Your door was open, so I wanted to get out.” She said simply, looking at me with a gleam of slyness in her gray eyes. “After all, you didn’t seem to want to get out.” 

	My eyes blazed in irritation. “I did want to,” I said irritably, “I just didn’t realize the car had stopped.” 

“Because you were too busy daydreaming, like always.” Chelsy replied.

“No I wasn’t!” I hissed indignantly. 

“Hey, now, no quarreling. You can be arguing right after we get out of the car, or we’re going back home.” Hailey said sternly, her gaze raking across me and my sister. “Humph!” I muttered, crossing my arms in a frustrated way. 

“Look,” She pointed at something that looked like a checkout stand at a grocery store behind a glass wall, “that looks like we could check out there.”

I nodded and she led the way across the hard parking lot. 

	A forest of trees lined the edges of the parking lot, with dark shadows hiding, waiting to pounce and snatch someone. I shivered at the thought of it. Imagine being kidnapped!

	After a few moments, my mother opened the glass door and strided to the blue and white checkout stand. 

“Hello,” The lady at the stand said, “are you here for the tour?”

My mother nodded, “Yes, is this where we get our tickets?” She questioned, pulling out her wallet out of a dark indigo case. 

The lady at the stand nodded and pulled out her hand, waiting to be handed money. My mother understood clearly, like any other person, and handed the long haired lady fifty dollars. 

“Thank you; now here are your tickets, ma’am.” She said, handing us three yellowish tickets. 

“No, thank *you*.” Hailey said as grabbed the tickets out of the ladies' gloved hand. She handed one ticket each to me and my sister. Chelsy snatched one up almost immediately and looked shyly at the lady and eyed a glass jar full of colorful lollipops. The lady seemed to pick up on it and pushed the jar forward. 

I grabbed two lollipops, handing one to Chelsy. 

After the brown haired lady explained the tour to us, me, Chelsy and Hailey walked out of the opened blue door that led to a dirt and sand trail through the trees.

I wanted to share my story and see if anyone here has gone through something similar. I’m a 22-year-old guy, and over the past few years, I’ve been grinding hard. About three years ago, I started a few companies and have been working 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM almost every day since. I’ve always thought I was taking good care of myself—working out, sleeping well, and eating clean.

# The Build-Up

Around 2 years ago, I started feeling like work wasn’t as fun anymore. My business partner began pushing me hard—calling me out every time I messed something up—and it really started to take a toll. Fast forward to August 2023, I packed my life into two bags and traveled around Europe for a month. During that time, I started sleeping less and drinking more, though I kept up with my workouts.

After that trip, I planned to go to Cape Town. At the airport, I had two glasses of wine and suddenly felt extremely dizzy. While waiting at the gate, I couldn’t breathe and had what I think was my first-ever panic attack. It was terrifying, but it passed after a couple of hours on the plane.

# Where Things Went Downhill

When I arrived, I felt okay for a day. But the next morning, I had coffee, and *boom*—derealization hit me like a truck. I felt completely disconnected from myself, and it hasn’t gone away since. I stayed in bed for three days, panicking, before flying home.

Since then, I’ve been dealing with these symptoms on and off:

* **Headaches**: Mostly in the neck and front of my head (come and go).
* **Derealization/Depersonalization**: Constant, 24/7.
* **Fatigue**: I feel drained all the time.
* **Tinnitus**: This started about two months ago.
* **Sleep**: I sleep one extra hour per night now but still feel tired.
* **No motivation for work**: I used to love working, but now I can’t find the drive.
* **Weak hands**: My grip feels weak at times, but it’s fine when I work out.
* **Blurry/busy vision**: It happens occasionally.
* **Health anxiety**: Constantly worrying about what’s wrong with me.

I have always been a guy who have found ""Cure"" in things.

If I'm tired, I workout more, sleep better and eat better food.

If I was stressed I went to the forest.

If I wanted someone to love me I found a girl for a few months.

I've always found a solution for everything, even tho they haven't been good always.

**My Current Lifestyle**

**Right now, I’m trying to maintain a balanced lifestyle to support my recovery. I work out 4-5 times a week and eat clean foods, including fruits, while also taking supplements like creatine, zinc, and magnesium. I sleep until my body naturally wakes up and work around 6-8 hours a day.**

**However, I don’t hang out with friends much, which I know isn’t great for mental health, but I do have a girlfriend who’s been supportive. Living in Sweden, it’s dark and cold this time of year, so I haven’t been spending much time outside, which might also play a role in how I’m feeling.**

# Extra Context

For the past 2-3 years, I’ve also had ongoing issues with one of my testicles. It’s been a hard time dealing with this, and I think it’s added to my stress. I’ve booked my 10th appointment to figure it out because I want answers.

I also booked an appointment to check if I really have asthma since I don’t want to use my asthma medication anymore unless I truly need it.

# What I’m Wondering

* Do I need to resolve these other issues (like my testicle problems or asthma concerns) before I can fully recover from what I’m going through now?
* Is it even possible to burn out at 22?
* Has anyone else experienced derealization or similar symptoms from stress?
* What helped you recover?
* Should I stop booking appointments and just go about my life?

I think I’m doing this because I want to figure out what’s wrong with me. Any insights, experiences, or tips on recovery would mean the world to me.

Thanks in advance!",3,1734651788.0,Depersonalization,1,1.0,False
1hi6h98,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1hi6h98/my_journey_seeking_advice_derealization/,My journey / seeking advice.       Derealization.,"This is gonna be pretty long, not very long, but kind of long. So don’t waste your time if you don’t wanna read, I’ve had derealization for going on a year. I’m a 23 year old guy. I had depersonalization when I was 14 or 15 years old from smoking weed and having a panic attack that went away on its own after a few very short months now at the age of 23 years old I got derealization from mixing Ativan benzodiazepine with alcohol. ( and no, it was not intentional.) I took Ativan the day prior and the next day I didn’t take it at all because I was planning on drinking and I got really drunk that night and then I wake up the next morning and boom I have the derealization. For the first month and a half two months I called out of work. I was in bed did not want to step out of the house. The world felt so fake. I couldn’t handle it. I had all these responsibilities that I could not take care of, and I was so scared of the derealization to the point where it literally crippled me. At that point, I decided to go to my psychiatrist, and thankfully, my psychiatrist knew about derealization and depersonalization, and then we started the experimenting of the medication. We started off with Lexapro like most people at first it made it worse but then it got a little bit better. I started off at 5 mg now I’m at 25 mg of Lexapro. All it did was just help very very slightly. My anxiety was through the roof and mind you I never really had anxiety like that. I never really even believe in anxiety. So then Xanax was introduced into the picture. I started off with half milligram of Xanax and now I’m on 4 mg a day. I’m allowed 4 mg a day sometimes I take three sometimes I take 3 1/2 on really bad days I take four I don’t want the whole speech of How Xanax is addicting. I know exactly how addicting it is, but it was the only thing that was able to get me out of the house and back to a functioning world and society so addiction is the least of my concerns right now. I then got Adderall introduced into the picture Which I’m allowed 40 mg a day. I take it in the morning with coffee and I’m wired. I feel awake. I feel alive and I don’t feel the de realization as much if any honestly if I’m keeping my mind distracted when I come down from the Adderall and have Adderall Crash is when the derealization starts to kick in and then that’s when I pop a Xanax The point of this post is two things one if you’re reading this that means you’re probably going through it or you’ve been through it. It gets better I promise I swear to you, I was at a point where I lost all hope for some people the answer is medication for some people. The answer is grounding methods for some people. The answer is leave it alone and it’ll go away by itself everybody’s different. What works for me Might not work for you. I just wanna give some positive reinforcement and let people know that there is hope. you’re not going crazy all it is is excessive stress on your brain. You’re gonna be OK it can’t harm you. My best thing is the more I distract myself the less I feel it and then I end up forgetting about it. Eventually, I go hours at a time without even realizing it because of how distracted I keep myself now the other thing is, I’m looking for some advice in terms of drinking. I’ve literally had three drinks in the past almost one year for the sake of staying social and just being able to let loose once in a while, I want to be able to learn how to comfortably drink. I went from being able to kill a whole bottle of tequila by myself to now anytime I have a sip of alcohol. I feel the de realization but I know 90% of it if not 100% it’s just me getting in my own brain and telling myself if you drink, you’re gonna feel it and then the placebo if that kicks in and I end up actually feeling it. I had half a beer last week and then I felt it coming on pretty hard so I put the beer down. I started chugging water. I took a Xanax and I ate food. But then for the next few days, I felt very off. And now eventually, I’m back to feeling normal ISH again it’s weird. I have a drink and then for the next few days I feel very off. I hate that I wanna be able to socially drink. But the only thing that seems to really take away, my de realization is the Xanax and I definitely don’t want to take Xanax and drink alcohol at the same time so what I was thinking is maybe I’ll take a small dose of Xanax, two or three hours before I have a drink so then by the time I have a drink, I’m cool calm and content, and maybe I won’t overthink myselfinto derealization. If anybody has some tips or tricks or just even advice, I would love to hear it. My doctor told me I’m just getting in my head too much, which is making the de realization come on every time I try to have a drink. I found my cocktail of meds that works for me to get me through life for the time being. I understand how addictive Adderall and Xanax can be. I’m not looking for a speech on addiction or withdrawals. I’m just sharing my story to give some people some hope and at the same time looking for some advice on how I can get back to socially drinking at a very healthy moderation without feeling this way",2,1734651659.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False

My father has a friend, I haven't seen him for a long time.... Anyway at the 1st meeting such a joker, very nice etc. He hugged at the end even though I wanted to shake hands.
At the 2nd meeting he was also very nice, making me feel special, e.g. that supposedly no one had ever asked him for sugar for coffee and that I had to be confident, he chose the flavour of the ice cream according to my favourite colour because he asked me what colours were my favourite, some jokes only in my direction even though my father and brother behaved the same way, etc. He also told me that I had to be sure of myself.
He stroked me twice as he passed then stopped and stroked me....
He commissioned a painting of cats from me, nice contact, first he asked if I could paint it for him etc.
I painted for 6 days, I tried very hard and when I finished the painting I sent it for evaluation, whether to improve etc.
And he ignored it, didn't reply and the next morning he sent 2 paintings including one erotically oriented with a woman naked with handcuffs around her hands. And he didn't ask if I could paint it, he just wrote that I was to get acquainted and I was to paint it.
It has been two months since this situation, I wrote a reminder message on Monday with this picture of cats and he read it after a few minutes and ignores it again.
I would like to mention that he has been telling my father for two months that the painting (of the cats) is beautiful and that he will order another one from me, that it is great and that he will pick it up, but he does not know how to answer me briefly and to the point, he just ignores me. And he was so nice, when I wrote that I was starting to paint the picture I wrote that it was great and he would surely be proud of my work.

To be fair he would hand me over to her most weekends I was supposed to stay with him. For nine years now she had this boyfriend. He quickly moved into her house from his mother’s where he was staying recouping after his 2nd divorce. We will call him J. And my father’s mother just grandma. 

At first grandma and J told me it wasn’t even a question of course they would take me in. J had told my grandma’s mother we will call her GG that he didn’t know if he could do the relationship with grandma because of how much of her time I took. I confronted grandma with this and she said GG shouldn’t have told me that. When J moved into with my grandma my dad was living in the basement and was told he needed to move out. After I had moved in GG was folding my laundry. I was in my room feeling lonely being separated from my siblings. Even though my mom wasn’t safe to be with I still missed her. J called me to the living room sounding angry. I stood in the door way of the living room with GG J and my grandma looking at me my underwear on the coffee table. ( I am 13 I do not buy my own clothes.)(they were cheeky undies with pink lace and leopard print.) 

“What are those?” J yelled questioned me.

Feeling my whole body flush with embarrassment having come from an abusive home to this one I was scared and confused. 

“My underwear.” I said 
J got up 6’3” bent down so we were face to face.  I was only about 4’9”
“Girls who wear underwear like that are whores.” “Who are you showing those to?” Do you want to be a little whore?”

I cried afraid and confused. 

“Why are you talking to her like that?” GG said 
“That’s enough.” My grandma said weakly 

J walked back to his recliner and sat down “stop crying.” Whores dress like that that’s all I’m saying.” J explained to them 

GG got up and said will you walk me out  

“You can go to your room.” Grandma told me. 
I found the dog under the kitchen table for comfort. 

My gg told my grandma she’s never been more disappointed in her J went to bed I asked my grandma why that happened she said it was GG’s fault she flaunted my undies in-front of J and made him mad.

What are your thoughts on this situation?,"I posted this in the social anxiety subreddit first, but didn’t get much of a response so I’m trying here because I’m both introverted and have social anxiety. 

I absolutely HATE the idea of driving other people in my car especially for long road trips. In fact I will do anything to avoid it. People find it offensive and do not understand my perspective. Im a calm, cool, and most importantly safe driver alone. Me myself and I and hours of podcasts, music, a large coffee, and a pack of gum. It’s almost a meditative experience for me. 

Add a passenger into the mix, I don’t care if it’s my own mother or good friend, and my heart begins racing. My hands are clammy just typing this.. The thought of having to put on a show for 8 hours with no escape and worry about the needs and expectations of someone else while chatting and hurtling down the highway and in and out and around mountains scares me. It worries me that they are judging my driving, they are going to panic and therefore cause me to panic, and I’m going to be trapped in an all day socializing marathon hellscape. Whilst being judged and critiqued. 

For full context, I’m driving back to my apartment in another state 8 hours away after the holidays. I made the drive here already to my hometown no problem. Conditions were a little tricky between the mountains, rain, and fog. Nothing I was stressed out about though. I was alone and relaxed.

Hey Reddit! 

I just had to share my amazing experience visiting the Hoover Dam yesterday. As someone who's always been fascinated by massive engineering projects, this was definitely on my bucket list. After researching different tour options, I went with this one: https://athometouch.com/HooverDam and honestly, it exceeded all my expectations.

First off, the convenience factor was great. They picked us up right from our hotel on the Strip around 8 AM in a super comfortable bus with WiFi and bathroom (crucial for that morning coffee situation). Our guide, Mike, was hilarious and incredibly knowledgeable - definitely not your typical dry tour guide.

Our first stop was the iconic ""Welcome to Las Vegas"" sign for some quick photos. Then we headed to Boulder City, which has this fascinating history as a purpose-built town for dam workers. The local museum there gives you amazing context about what life was like during construction in the 1930s.

But the real highlight? Going 524 feet down inside the actual dam for the powerplant tour. It's mind-blowing seeing those massive turbines up close and learning how they convert water power into electricity for millions of homes. The engineering is just insane.

We spent about 45 minutes walking on top of the dam with our guide explaining everything. The views from the Memorial Bridge are absolutely spectacular - you can see the whole structure and get those perfect Instagram shots. The visitor center has some really cool exhibits too.

They included lunch at a local restaurant (I had a pretty decent burger), and surprisingly, we even got free tickets to the LA Comedy Club at The Strat for later that night.

The whole tour took about 5.5 hours and cost $59, which I thought was totally worth it considering everything that was included. Plus, you're not rushed at all - there's plenty of time to explore and take photos.

Pro tips:
- Wear comfortable walking shoes
- Bring a water bottle (it gets hot!)
- Don't forget your camera
- Try to sit on the right side of the bus for the best views

If you're planning to visit the dam, I highly recommend booking this tour (link above). It's honestly the most organized and comprehensive way to experience it. They're really popular though, so book in advance - our bus was full.

Would love to hear from others who've visited the dam! What was your experience like?

We have been talking for 3 months.  It started off slow but in the last 1-2 months it started to build up; our communication became more regular and consistent, we started to make more regular plans to see each other, he was taking more initiative to ask me out.  I was feeling good about him.  We were about to go on our 5th date until he got laid off work.

I have made it clear to him that I’m here for him in whatever capacity he needs me to be and that I want to help him through this period.  I’ve helped look at his resume and I’m actively looking for jobs postings to send to him.  

Ever since he got laid off (couple weeks ago), I feel like we seem to be regressing.  The communication is starting to slow down, there is inconsistency on his end, sometimes my texts just go unanswered.  We haven’t talked on the phone in a week.  I know it’s nothing personal, he’s just going through life. 

Because of the lack of communication from his end, I’ve been trying to give him space while also checking in on him to see how he’s doing.  He has apologized to me that he doesn’t feel like himself these days and he’s just focused on getting a job, and that’s his priority right now.  He has expressed a fear of becoming a bum and spiraling into depression.  He even made a passing comment the other day about how he declined hanging out with friends because he needs to focus on this. 

I like this guy so far, and it’s not often that I come across people I feel this way about.  I’m just unsure how to proceed.  Should I give him his space or should I ask him out, something low key like just grabbing coffee?  The issue is he lives 2 hours from me, so I would have to find an excuse to use that I’m near his area and want to meet up.  I don’t know if it’s too bold of me to offer to drive to him to meet up, we have been meeting up in the middle so far for all of our dates. 

If it was any of you in this scenario, would you want space?  Or would you like if the girl made the effort to come see you? 

TLDR: The man (36M) that I (34F) just started seeing got laid off work.  I like him a lot and want to be there for him.  Should I give him space or offer to come see him and take him out? ",2,1734650406.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

By evening, I finally stepped out for my **coffee ritual**, followed by some quiet reading time. It was peaceful, the kind of moment where the world feels calm.

Then came an unexpected twist—a call from a friend. Turns out, he was upset because I hadn’t called him back. He was genuinely worried, thinking something might be wrong.

That moment hit differently—it’s heartwarming to have friends who **truly care for you**, who notice even the small silences. It’s a reminder that life feels richer when you have people who genuinely look out for you. 

So here’s my takeaway: **everyone needs at least one friend like that**—the kind who checks in, even when it’s just about a missed call.

1hi5zfe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hi5zfe,"When death finds you, may it find you alive","3 years ago I messaged my gym crush telling her I wanted to take her out for 'coffee'. 

Last night I asked her to marry me…

She said no both times and has now blocked me... 

So here’s a photo of me this morning. 😜😂

Well, jokes apart, I thought I should share what just happened. 

I was semi-sick with an infection that went so bad that I was rushed to the ER a month back and operated upon the next morning. Almost saw Jesus! 

A few days in the ICU with no visitors and nurturing myself back to good health all alone lent me new perspective on life.

Please, no questions about my sickness or anything. (Not even to my parents) 

Despite being administered heavy doses of painkillers, I whimpered in pain like a fish out of water. But my father trained us very well to not complain and to handle pain effectively, all alone. 

I drove into the ER myself and drove back home a week later. 

Started working out four days later with 16 surgical staples still in my groin and that hurt bad but not enough to keep me down. 

PRASAD naam sun ke food samjhe kya?!!

I’ve lost weight, lost appetite but haven’t lost the fire. 🔥 

Today is the monthly anniversary of my second surgery after the first one went wrong. (2nd picture) 

Merry Xmas 🎄. Peace and blessings to your family and you. 

Friends and relatives in North America (or anywhere) : 

Don’t feel guilty. You’re not obligated to keep a tab on me; neither do I expect you to drop everything and visit me, nor was it an emergency of any kind. 

Trust me when I say I’m not alone; he is with me in deep waters and the waters cannot drown me, he is with me in the fire, and the fire cannot burn me and the flame cannot consume me. 

Thanks for your prayers and support. 

When death finds you, may it find you alive. 🔥🙏🏼

We finished up business and I told him again and we went on with our night.

Next morning it hurts to pee a little and I feel the pressure in my tummy that is a vietnam flashback reminder of my last UTI. I scold my (very apologetic and guilty) boyfriend and he promises to never ever do it again, I drink the zipcodes entire supply of cranberry tea, get an antibiotic pouch that you dissolve in water and the next day I'm good. Day 3; I wake up and feel more pressure in my tummy, not as bad as the first day but my doctor reccomends I get another antibiotic pouch, drink more cranberry tea and now we're on day 4. I feel fine today, I'm drinking cranberry tea and avoiding coffee and alcohol, however, I fear that tomorrow I will feel more pressure/pain when I pee.

What are the odds that this isn't just a UTI and I should get my urine/vaginal microbiome checked out? We have a trip planned for New Years and I'm a little anxious that I'll have to either a. endure this for the entire trip, or b. cancel the trip which I really do not want to do.

Is it possible that a narcissistic person can change? 

I’ve been dating this guy for about a month and I’ve been seeing some red flags. 

He doesn’t handle criticism well. Whenever I bring up something that he did that I didn’t like, he gets extremely defensive over it. He then changes the discussion into mentioning things that he doesn’t like. He just invalidates my feelings and worries about his only. 

He also seems pretty insecure. He gets upset with me whenever I post a picture of myself because “it’s going to get a lot of likes”. Mind you, I don’t take nor post any provocative photos. They’re simply selfies of me or fully body pictures of me fully clothed. One time I posted a picture that got a lot of likes. He got upset because he felt that he was “competing with all those 2,000 likes”. I reassured him that I don’t have interest in anyone else but him. 

He also doesn’t like complimenting me. He says he doesn’t compliment women because it makes him feel like he’s too “pressed”. It’s gotten to a point where I sometimes feel like we’re just friends. I’ve mentioned this to him and he says that’s not true. I feel otherwise. 

He also talks down on others appearances for no reason. For instance, he’ll randomly judge someone else’s boyfriend by saying, “her boyfriend’s really ugly” or “that guy that commented on your post has spaced teeth.”

He has a habit of blocking and unblocking me on social media when he gets upset. He’ll go a few days or weeks of having me blocked and then randomly unblocks me. I posted a picture a few days ago and he immediately blocked me. He also has a habit of monitoring my social media.

He seems pretty controlling. I once mentioned that I was interested in getting a small tattoo. He immediately hesitated and said “please don’t”. Funny enough, he follows women on social media who have a lot of tattoos and piercings which is something he said he doesn’t like lol. 

He also has a habit of telling all of our issues to his friends, family, and therapist. Every little issue we have he goes and tells them. I’ve told him to please stop doing that and he disregarded that. I don’t understand how he expects me to meet his friends and family since they most likely have this negative perception of me now. 

He’s also love-bombed me. He’s told me that I’m his “dream woman” and he feels like “I’m the one”. He’s even mentioned something about “being in love with me” and planning our wedding already. 

I also wanted to share this. We went to get coffee one time and I suppose the barista who made our drinks was new. My coffee didn’t taste good and I asked her nicely if she could remake the drink. She happily did and while she was remaking it, my boyfriend was getting upset with me. He told me that I was “making him look bad” for making a big deal about my coffee not tasting good. Especially since he goes to that coffee shop often. He also said I was embarrassing him. The barista made the drink wrong again. I told him about it and he just told me “it is what it is” and said “let’s go”. He then got upset for making him “waste money” on a drink he knew that wasn’t made right instead of making sure it was made right. 

One thing that I don’t understand is that he sees his therapist on a daily basis and still acts like this. He’s also told me that I have everything he looks for in a partner. If that’s the case, why does he act this way with me? Should I hope for any change or just leave and move on?",1,1734650006.0,dating_advice,4,1.0,False

What started as an excuse to get better at using Notion quickly developed into a daily obsession. I’ve greatly enjoyed the process of tracking my brews, and I’ve found it to have dramatically improved my palate, brewing technique, and overall appreciation for coffee.

Overall favorite beans since I started tracking:

1. [Hydrangea Gesha Washed Lot 17 El Burro](https://timhwang21.notion.site/Gesha-Washed-Lot-17-El-Burro-2eced26b7b9d43278611f74ebcda52bb?pvs=23) — the sweetness, florality, mouthfeel, lack of off flavors, and overall cleanliness of this bean makes it my #1 for the year. This is probably what my Platonic ideal for a washed Panamanian Gesha looks like.
2. [The Picky Chemist Deborah Echo Washed Geisha](https://timhwang21.notion.site/Panama-Deborah-Echo-Washed-Geisha-15a8ee09606f80e99f23d59a1a40d046?pvs=23) — I only had 2 cups of this from a sample, but that was enough to leave a deep impression. The florals were so strong that they were distinctly tasteable, yet did not feel artificial in the way that strong flavors from other heavy processing methods can feel. These were probably the best CM process beans I’ve ever had.
3. [Minmax Kiamugumo AB](https://timhwang21.notion.site/Kiamugumo-AB-f152adf902eb4f0bb337476d42f0d926?pvs=23) — clean + sweet + floral/herbal + bright + nice body = basically everything I am looking for in a washed Kenyan. I’ve found that when it comes to ultralight roasts, Kenyan coffees align very well with my own preferences. These beans in particular were lighter on the savory, tomato notes, and had a subtle herbality that I found complemented the bright berry acidity beautifully.
4. [Sey Servio Botina](https://timhwang21.notion.site/Servio-Botina-c43fbf49faa04eeca1cf109b9575e99a) and [Aviary 009 - Abelardo Medina](https://timhwang21.notion.site/009-Abelardo-Medina-1348ee09606f80e59b2bc8d86fa6c940) — two pink bourbons that do a great job of capturing what makes the varietal so appealing. Both were super consistent to the point where it was a challenge to get a bad cup, and it was very easy to adjust brew parameters to reveal different facets of the coffee. Going from a classic Pink Bourbon zippy acidity to a more rounded sweetness based on my current mood was a ton of fun. I also had a brew of a \~6 month old Sey roast from an earlier harvest and it was still really good.
5. Honorable mention: [MAME UBA Yellow](https://timhwang21.notion.site/UBA-Yellow-8dc0027eab8943dead32c923d30fe1a3?pvs=74) — produced some truly awful cups (likely brewer error) and some incredible ones as well, and one of the more interesting processed beans I’ve tried. I generally treat flavor notes more as directional hints instead of literal interpretations, but this really did taste almost exactly like mango lassi. Also notable was the fact that these were some of the worst smelling beans I’ve ever had (which thankfully did not translate into taste).

Other notes:

* Almost all brews start from a base recipe of 12.5g/200ml, 4.0-5.5 on ZP6, 4 pours of 50ml each, with temperatures ranging from 97ºC (dense ultralight washed) to mid-80s (heavily processed). Origami Air S with Cafec Abaca.
* Since I started tracking, I’ve gone through 5.7kg of coffee. The true number is probably closer to 6kg due to the occasional espresso or brews with friends that I didn’t track. That’s about 33g / day, which tracks as I generally do about 3 brews per day.
* Favorite roaster for the year is without a doubt Hydrangea, due to easy accessibility, consistent quality / lack of duds, and interesting green selection. Roasters I’m very interested in getting full bags from: The Picky Chemist, Oma, September. I only had small sample bags, but they were all extremely impressive.
* A note on scores: the scores I put are very influenced by personal tastes and by factors such as brewing error. I don’t think they’re a particularly good benchmark for bean or roaster quality.
* For those interested in comparing roast levels, I tried to take a sample photo of each bag. A full gallery can be found [here](https://timhwang21.notion.site/5af793f374314252b141faca490994b8?v=12d8ee09606f80a6af86000c6f823658&pvs=74). Note that I didn’t bother color correcting; I think my phone normalized exposure levels, which makes relative color across beans seem more uniform than they actually are (at least based on my subjective perception).
* [Here is a breakdown by varietal](https://timhwang21.notion.site/5af793f374314252b141faca490994b8?v=1618ee09606f8035987d000cbb5c1509). I think gesha is overrepresented due to things like sample swaps between friends.",12,1734649831.0,pourover,3,0.94,False

So as the title says, I am 31 years old and recently discovered this subreddit and I thought it would be cool to post something on here and see where it goes. 

I am a singer and music producer and have been producing my own music as a hobby for the last 3 years or so  which I thoroughly enjoy. I have a little home studio which I work from and I have been working from here for the last 3 years or so. I am blind and music has been an especially important feature of my life. 
With regards to music, I produce house, tropical house, trap, reggaeton, bachata and other genres, but I am especially into urban music such as trap and drill. 

Aside from music I have a wide variety of hobbies, including swimming, bowling, rock climbing, traveling, and especially going to coffee shops and restaurants. 

I have traveled quite a bit with my family and have spent quite a lot of time in the US and Europe. I use to spend a lot of time in Florida. 

I think we can all agree that quite a lot has changed since covid-19 and I have found, like many others, that it has gotten a lot harder to meet new people since the pandemic, at least in person anyway. Coupled with the fact I live in an area where there are few social outlets in the evenings and night, and the activities are largely limited to the bar scene or some kind of sports. 

I also enjoy studying meteorology and psychology, as well as reading academic journal articles about the formation of severe thunderstorms in many parts of the world.

""My dearest Drea,

My hope is that someday, it’s you who discovers this letter. Adrian can be impulsive and unpredictable, and I have no idea what he might do in the future.

Drea, my little spark, my strength—I wish I’d had more time to see you grow, to be there for you. You are my heart, my sunshine, and please, always remember that. There’s so much I want to say, but time has grown scarce; I can feel it slipping away. My health is failing quickly, and it’s not by accident.

You deserve to know, Drea, that the reason for my failing health is Vivian—your mother. I wanted so badly for our marriage to work, wanted to share everything with her. But she only cared about my fortune, and she’s gone to great lengths to secure it for herself.

My estate belongs solely to you and Adrian. I wanted to make this clear in a will, but I never expected time to run out this way. I’ve long suspected Vivian was tainting my drinks, but today, I’m certain. She brought me coffee not long ago, and there, faintly on the cup’s rim, were traces of a familiar poison. I could call the police or rush to the hospital, but instead, I choose to write to you now, hoping you find this someday, hidden here in your nursery.

If things go as I hope, David may look after you, maybe even adopt you, though he doesn’t know of you yet. If not, I pray Adrian finds you and keeps you safe. I believe you’ll grow into a remarkable woman, strong and resilient, Drea. Know that I loved you fiercely. Please tell Adrian that despite his anger over my choices, I’m deeply sorry and that I love him as well.

I love you both,

\~Emerson Grant""

The letter slipped from Drea’s trembling fingers, her legs giving way. Sorin quickly wrapped an arm around her shoulders, holding her upright as she crumpled into his side.

Tears blurred her vision, and through them, she looked up at Sorin, whose expression held a quiet grief. Though he was only a child back then, his affection for his uncle had been real.

She managed to choke out, “W-what does this mean?”

""Shh,"" Sorin soothed her, bending to pick up the letter and carefully slipping it into her book. “Not here, not now. Let’s get home, then we can talk.”

She nodded, her lips trembling as tears spilled over. Sorin gently wiped them away, wrapped an arm around her waist, and guided her out of the room. They descended the stairs quietly, moving toward the exit.

Just as they reached the door, her mother’s shrill voice called after them, “Leaving already? You haven’t stayed for lunch.”

Sorin’s jaw clenched tightly. Murderous woman, he thought, before turning to face her with a forced smile. “I’d rather have lunch alone with my wife. Thanks.” With that, he steered Drea out the door.

Once they were safely away, he pulled the car to a stop by the side of the road, dropping his head against the steering wheel. “Damn it, damn it, damn it.”

A soft touch settled over his hand, gripping the wheel tightly. Lifting his head, he found Drea’s gaze, shimmering with unshed tears as she tried to hold them back.

“D-do you… think this could really be true?” Her voice trembled with uncertainty.

He reached for the book and retrieved the letter, directing her gaze to its signature. “Look, he signed it. If we can track down some old documents he might’ve signed, we’ll have proof.” He paused, deep in thought. “Dad must have something lying around.” A loud groan escaped him as he pinched the bridge of his nose, tears gathering in his eyes. “Why did my uncle have to be so reckless? He could’ve at least confided in my father and asked for his help! Damn it!”

Drea intertwined her fingers with his, offering a comforting squeeze. “We… we don’t really know what was going on back then…”

A sob erupted from him. “I loved him so much, Drea. I don’t remember everything, but I know I did. To learn he met such a tragic end…”

Leaning forward, Drea rested her forehead against his bicep, weeping alongside him. He lowered his chin onto her head, tears streaming down his cheeks as they sought solace in one another’s embrace.

After several moments, he wiped his eyes and said, “Call Adrian. Tell him to meet us at home.”

Drea nodded as Sorin drove away. When they arrived, Adrian sat at the dining table, his head bowed and hands gripping his hair in despair, the letter sprawled before him.

Taking a seat beside him, Drea wrapped her arm around him, offering comfort while Sorin stood back, his mind racing as he contemplated their next steps. Grief could wait; justice for his uncle was their immediate priority, and Sorin vowed he wouldn’t rest until it was served.

Suddenly, Adrian shot up from his seat, his eyes bloodshot and wild. He pulled out his pistol from the holster at his waist, making Drea gasp softly in shock.

“That’s it! That woman is going to pay today. I’ve tolerated her long enough!” He growled, striding toward the door. Drea grasped his wrist, desperately trying to halt him.

Some stats and I will also try to be concise and short but clear: 

The pastries I love are the types of marble cake, coffee, cake, cinnamon rolls, cheese Danish, apple turnovers, cookies, etc. The list is quite long but you get it. It's any pastry that is usually delicious. 


Age: early 30s
Pattern: every other night I will eat pretty much a box of whatever I got that night. This could be a box of cheese danishes, a box of muffins, a box of cinnamon marble cakes, etc. I don't leave anything for tomorrow.

I stay super active and eat well outside of this. I have an ideal weight for my height.

Height: 6'0
Weight: 182lbs 

I play sports, ski, run, bike, etc. My fear is that it will develope into diabetes. How can I stop this without fully quitting on pastries for good? I love them and just want a healthy relationship with them.

We’ve all been there. You're chatting with someone, mid-sentence, and you catch a whiff of…well, something less than pleasant. It’s often embarrassing, but bad breath happens. But what if your new healthy eating plan is the culprit? It might seem counterintuitive – after all, aren’t diets supposed to make us *better* versions of ourselves? Sometimes, though, the path to a healthier body can lead to some, shall we say, fragrant side effects. This article dives deep into the unexpected connection between bad breath (halitosis) and dieting, exploring the science behind the stink, and offering practical, easy-to-implement solutions to keep your breath fresh while pursuing your weight goals. We'll cover everything from keto breath to the impact of fasting, leaving no stone unturned in our quest for minty freshness. Ready to banish bad breath and diet in harmony? Let's get started!

Bad Breath on a Diet: Why Does it Happen?
-----------------------------------------

Before we jump into the specifics, let's talk about why diets can sometimes lead to dragon breath. Think of your body like a car. When you change the fuel source (from regular gasoline to, say, diesel), the engine runs differently. The same principle applies to our bodies. When we drastically alter our eating habits, our bodies adjust, and sometimes these adjustments manifest as bad breath. This isn't necessarily a bad thing – it's often just a temporary side effect.

### The Ketogenic Diet and ""Keto Breath""

Ah, the ketogenic diet. This low-carb, high-fat eating plan has taken the world by storm, promising rapid weight loss and improved energy levels. However, it comes with a potential downside: keto breath. Why? Well, when your body enters ketosis (the metabolic state where it burns fat for fuel instead of carbohydrates), it produces byproducts called ketones. One of these, acetone (yes, the same stuff in nail polish remover), is released through your breath, causing a distinctly fruity, almost metallic odor. Not exactly the kind of fragrance you want wafting from your mouth, huh?

- **Solutions for Keto Breath:** Staying hydrated is key! Flushing your system with plenty of water helps dilute the ketones. Chewing sugar-free gum or mints can also mask the odor temporarily. Lastly, upping your leafy green intake can help neutralize the smell.

### Intermittent Fasting and Its Impact on Breath

Intermittent fasting (IF), another popular weight-loss strategy, involves cycling between periods of eating and voluntary fasting. While IF offers several health benefits, it, too, can sometimes lead to bad breath. This is primarily due to reduced saliva production during fasting periods. Saliva plays a crucial role in washing away bacteria and food particles in the mouth. Less saliva equals more bacteria, which equals…you guessed it, bad breath. Adding to the issue, the breakdown of fat during fasting can also release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that contribute to the problem.

- **Solutions for IF-Related Bad Breath:** Again, hydration is your best friend! Drinking water throughout your fasting period (when allowed) can stimulate saliva production and minimize odor-causing bacteria. Practicing good oral hygiene, including brushing, flossing, and using a tongue scraper, is also essential.

Bad Breath on a Diet: Beyond Keto and IF
----------------------------------------

Of course, keto and intermittent fasting aren't the only dietary culprits behind bad breath. Other factors, such as low-calorie diets and detox cleanses, can also play a role.

### Low-Calorie Diets and Dehydration

When you significantly reduce your caloric intake, your body might go into a sort of ""conservation mode."" This can lead to dehydration, which, as we've already discussed, decreases saliva production and increases the likelihood of bad breath. Think of it like a drought in your mouth – a dry, arid landscape where bacteria thrive.

- **Solutions for Dehydration-Related Bad Breath:** No surprises here: drink more water! Carry a water bottle with you everywhere and sip on it throughout the day. Eating water-rich fruits and vegetables, like watermelon and cucumber, can also contribute to your overall hydration.

### Detox Cleanses and the Release of Toxins

Detox cleanses, while often touted for their supposed health benefits, can sometimes exacerbate bad breath. As your body flushes out toxins, some of these are released through your breath, potentially causing a temporary increase in odor. It's like cleaning out a dusty attic – you stir up all the dust before things get better.

- **Solutions for Detox-Related Bad Breath:** Focus on a balanced, sustainable approach to healthy eating rather than resorting to drastic cleanses. If you do choose to do a cleanse, be sure to drink plenty of water and practice excellent oral hygiene to minimize bad breath.

Bad Breath on a Diet: General Tips for Fresher Breath
-----------------------------------------------------

Regardless of the specific diet you're following, there are several general strategies you can employ to combat bad breath:

1. **Hydration, Hydration, Hydration:** Seriously, we can't stress this enough! Water is your secret weapon against bad breath. Aim for at least eight glasses a day.
2. **Prioritize Oral Hygiene:** Brush your teeth twice a day for two minutes each time, floss daily, and don’t forget to scrape your tongue! That’s where a lot of odor-causing bacteria hang out.
3. **Chew Sugar-Free Gum or Mints:** These can provide temporary relief by stimulating saliva production and masking odors. Look for xylitol-containing gum, which has been shown to have antibacterial properties.
4. **Eat Breath-Friendly Foods:** Crunchy fruits and vegetables, like apples and celery, can help clean your teeth and freshen your breath. Herbs like parsley and mint can also work wonders.
5. **See Your Dentist Regularly:** Regular checkups and cleanings are essential for maintaining good oral health and identifying any underlying dental issues that may be contributing to bad breath. Don't underestimate the power of a professional cleaning!

Bad Breath on a Diet: When to See a Doctor
------------------------------------------

While diet-related bad breath is usually temporary and harmless, it's important to see a doctor or dentist if you experience persistent bad breath that doesn’t improve with lifestyle changes. This could be a sign of an underlying medical condition, such as gum disease, diabetes, or even a sinus infection.

Bad Breath on a Diet: Addressing Specific Dietary Concerns
----------------------------------------------------------

Here are some specific dietary considerations to keep in mind:

- **High-Protein Diets:** While protein is essential for a healthy diet, excessively high protein intake can sometimes lead to bad breath due to the breakdown of amino acids. Ensuring adequate hydration and carbohydrate consumption can help mitigate this.
- **Garlic and Onion:** These flavorful ingredients are notorious for causing bad breath. Enjoy them in moderation, and be sure to brush your teeth thoroughly afterward. Think of it as a flavorful trade-off!
- **Coffee and Alcohol:** Both coffee and alcohol can dry out your mouth, contributing to bad breath. Limit your intake and stay hydrated.

Bad Breath on a Diet: The Takeaway
----------------------------------

Navigating the world of diets can be tricky, and the occasional bout of bad breath can add another layer of complexity. But don't let it derail your health journey! By understanding the connection between diet and halitosis and implementing the strategies we've discussed, you can achieve your weight goals while keeping your breath fresh and your confidence high. Remember, a healthy lifestyle is about balance. It's about nourishing your body from the inside out while also addressing those little, sometimes smelly, details that can make a big difference in your overall well-being. So, drink that water, brush those teeth, and embrace your journey towards a healthier, fresher you!

I have total aphantasia, but I've always been pretty sure I could had vivid dreams. I can't remember my dreams very well or recall anything visual, but the emotional impact of some of them always suggested they were vivid.

A few weeks ago I was lying in bed in the morning. I was fully aware that I was awake and just lying there not quite ready to get up. Because of the dreams, once in a while I'll try to visualize something while in that state, but it never works.

In this case, the first thing I thought was to visualize my living room. Suddenly I saw a random living room with white furniture (not mine), pretty vividly. 

I was shocked since I've never visualized anything before. I started to think of other things. In every case, I could see what I was thinking of, but it was always random versions of it (a car, not my car). I was lying there doing this for about 15 minutes just fascinated by the entire thing. 

Eventually I was visualizing holding a newspaper. I could see the paper and some hands holding it. I concentrated more on the hands and tried to see if I could visualize my actual hands. Suddenly both my hands and forearms were in front me as if I was holding them out looking at them for real. I can't visualize the visualization, but I remember thinking they were definitely mine. I could even move my fingers at will.

The whole time I felt like I was mostly awake, but not entirely. 

Eventually I got up, got some coffee, and tried to visualize something - with zero success. 

I've tried to recreate the experience a few times, but so far without much success. In one case I had a very dim visual of something - which is still a victory, but not like before

I still have a hard time comprehending that normal people can visualize like that, and I think it's even more mind-blowing now that I've experienced it.

It makes me think the hardware and software is all there for me to visualize, but it's somehow not connected when I'm awake.

We met in high school, I was a Junior and he was a Senior at separate schools. I met him where I worked and instantly my heart melted for him. A clean, overly sweet, hilarious dork who brought me bread rolls and would always engage in conversation with me and my coworkers. We started dating and the first red flag should have been him giving me his sweater, looking me right in the eyes and telling me it used to be his most recent ex’s. Wow. But I’m head over heels for him so I let it go. Fast forward to the summer and we are working together at a new job. I get him over $100 in birthday presents because he’s turning an adult now, so he deserves a board game he’s been looking forward to and a few snacks. He loves it. Two months later is my birthday, the first birthdays we’ve spent together, and what do I get? Nothing. Of course, I make excuses for him because he “doesn’t have a car” and “the closest Walmart is 40 mins away”. Best part is that we could have Amazon and any other packages to deliver where we are staying for work. I still, get nothing. More months go by, he’s starting college in a nearby city and I’m a Senior at high school. I take off every single Saturday to spend the entire day with him, mind you his apartment is 45 mins away and my parents have a 10 o’clock curfew for me. Every. Single. Saturday I would take off work, spend my own gas money, and spend a day with him. He visited me twice that semester. Well I chalk it up to “he doesn’t have a car” “he doesn’t have a job” “he’s a full time student” bullshit. Every year my immediate family travels across the country to see my extended family for Christmas, so for a few weeks I didn’t get to see him. When I got back guess what kind of present was waiting for me! Nothing once again. Anyways I continue this trend and graduate high school. During that summer he went back to work and I had some personal issues so I could go with. You think he would take the time to come see me because he had his very own car again, but a month goes by and I have to drive two hours to see him on his birthday. I get him gifts like a fantastic girlfriend would do! By the end of the summer he doesn’t see me on my birthday, doesn’t get me a gift, and I have to move into college a week before he gets back from work. Well I move into college and meet some wonderful people, and I introduce them to my boyfriend a few months later. I had already taken a two hour bus ride to see him, and he made me late for the bus back home. It left without me. Finally he drives two hours to come spend the weekend with me and my friends. Great! But you know only once per semester because it’s “too expensive”, while I take the bus home every two weeks just so I can not only see my family, but cross out a whole day for him too. This Christmas is finally the one where he can come meet my extended family! My parents buy us plane tickets because there is no room in the car for both of us to travel with them. This man gets a free plane ticket there and back, free housing and food for a few weeks, and free event admission for when we saw movies and did historical hikes. Finally Christmas Eve! My entire extended family is sitting around the living room and we start opening presents. But the end I didn’t receive anything from him, but Christmas Day is reserved for immediate family presents only, so I think that’s the perfect time to give him my gift. Christmas morning comes I give him a ceramic mug I had hand made for him. He likes coffee and nature so a mug with forest designs is perfect. He loves it, says thank you, and the best part… nothing. I get. Fucking. Nothing. Here I am, surrounded my my family all watching as I push back my emotions. I thought it would be different this time. I’ve talked to him over and over again about how it’s pretty important to get your girlfriend things for special holidays. Well, the usual “I’m sorry I’ll do better next time” comes and I let it go. Oh, and the past two valentines days were the same. I visited him with a box of gifts, he says thank you and nothing more. Wow we’re already reaching two and a half years together! Since he didn’t get me anything for Christmas, he’s getting nothing for Valentine’s Day. (Side note he didn’t care). First year of college is over and he goes back to work out of state for the summer. I get a summer job back home and pretty much am by myself the whole time. I visit him on his birthday for a few hours, mind you I drive two hours there in the morning and two hours back, getting home at around 1 in the morning. I just get him a jar of his favorite candy I had special ordered from out of the country, it wasn’t that expensive. I spend the rest of the summer working and my birthday comes and goes. Before I move into my first apartment, he says he has a gift for me! Omg! I’m so excited! Can y’all guess what it could be?? I’m an 18 year old girl at this point and I love the ocean, pop culture, and stuffed animals. Yall… he reaches into his bag and hands me a beyblade. A BEYBLADE??? MF SPINNING TOP FOR MY 18th BIRTHDAY??? I’m just so awkward at this point as I’m trying to be grateful but this feels like a stab through the heart. Like he has never once known me in the few years we’ve been in a romantic relationship. Anyways, I move into a new apartment and start my second year of school. I’m loving it here, I’m getting really into the major i chose, and I start to realize that even though he has a car, THREE JOBS NOW, and his own place, that it shouldn’t be too hard for him to visit me now, right? WRONG! It’s “too expensive”. So for three weeks I seriously contemplated why I was with this guy. Of course I loved him, he’s my best friend, we bring out the best in each other and he’s wonderful to be around! Finally my roommate talks some sense into me that this will be the rest of my life, always trying to get him to put in more effort to appreciate me in the way I wanted to be appreciated. Several conversations I’ve had in the past didn’t change anything, so why keep trying when there is someone out there who actually wants to spoil me? November comes around and I absolutely am dreading seeing him and his family because I’ve lost a lot of respect for him, so I call him and break up within 45 mins. He says he can fix it “in a week” yeah no thanks there’s nothing you could possibly do to make up for this, man. So this is a pretty common problem with a lot of guys, so please for the love of god pay attention to what your girlfriend appreciates or she will leave you and you won’t see it coming. I was honestly the best partner my ex could ever have, and he made the decision to not pay attention to what I held close to my heart. Literally my roommate knew me for a day and then surprised me with THRIFTED, SILVER, SHARK EARRINGS! The best possible gift I have ever received.
