**I've come here to mutually satiate a longing for connection with another person.**

**I want someone to chat with daily. I want someone to write lengthy letters back and forth with. I want someone to go on adventures with. I want someone with a strong, vibrant soul who can play well with my own strong and vibrant soul.** All in the same person? Wonderful! But, I don't have such lofty expectations of anyone - including of myself. If all we can have are the daily chats, or penpal exchanges, or adventures, I'd be more than happy, and hope you would be too.

**I'm 34, male, and live in the Eastern US. My only requirement for those who message me is that they're 18 or older, but I do tend to get along with cisgender women best.**

**I adore passionate people and interactions with a meaningful basis.** I have a zest for many things in life and much prefer people who also do. Of course, this isn't always how things are. I can also be deeply lethargic and melancholic and would hope whomever I meet understands that side of life as well. **The deep bonds I'm seeking are developed over time and with a full comprehensive understanding of each other.** I dislike trivialities and limited interactions. I want us to feel each other out until we've mapped out every aspect of the other, allowing us to know what's possible and what we'd like to see happen.

**I want to make it clear that if whoever is reading this feels like we may have a connection or ability to bond together they should message me. No hesitations or doubts, please. I don't believe in losing potential and being self-defeated before anything even occurred. Many of my most monumental and longest connections were the result of someone casting away self-doubt and not letting it stop them from meeting me. There's far more to gain than there is to lose, as foreboding and discouraging as things may seem sometimes.**

So, who am I, exactly? And who are you? Here are some notable values, interests, and traits to consider:

* **I strive to engage in genuine and authentic discussion.** I understand that it can take time to open up and feel comfortable, and this is completely understandable, but my ultimate and ideal goal is to engage in a deep, intimate, meaningful way.
* **The complex vulnerabilities within a person are as important as anything else.** Most people have endured some form of trauma or pain, or are subject to some form of mental turmoil or woes. The type of connection I want understands, accepts, and embraces this reality. However, the type of connection I want also strives to live in spite of these things and to heal and advance in a comprehensive and considerate way.
* **Creativity and artistry are important to me.** Personally, I engage in more literary arts, primarily writing intellectually, about observations and thoughts, and conversationally, not uncommonly poetically and intensely. I can appreciate and admire many different types of expression, whether I involve myself in them or not.
* **Ruminating, researching, and coming to understand new things is a major and critical part of my life.** I, by choice, am an autodidact. The motto '*Nitimur in vetitum semper cupimusque negata*.' is a pretty good summary of my intellectual ethics. I deem nothing to be above reproach, and also that there is no outcome in which everyone benefits or avoids misfortunate calamity.
* **Knowing yourself is critical to me, and it should be to you too.** I absolutely don't require someone to know themselves fully, and am eagerly accepting of people who don't know themselves well or are even at a loss. But, you should know some basic things about yourself. I've had so many people message me and lose interest when they find out I don't game daily or share some hyper specific stance of a cultural phenomenon. Do you have a hobby or belief that would be considered a ""deal breaker"" for you if someone didn't also share it? If you do, really know what and why that is and bring it up early.
* **I'm not a 'present moment' or 'live your life the the fullest' type.** A lot of my life and values are based in things beyond myself. I exist as a blip of a transient moment with two sets of eternity, the past and future, all around me. That being said, I'm beginning to absorb that present moment in new and unique ways and am excited to see where it goes.
* **More casual hobbies of mine include photography, tech, incense, time pieces, archiving, collecting, coffee, and abstraction.** Inquire within if one stands out to you. I'm always surprised by what people consider to be interests and hobbies, so I probably have more I take for granted and didn't list here. **I haven't consumed media regularly in years**, but used to engage with a lot of it when I was younger, mostly including movies, anime/manga, and video games. I still watch movies from time to time, being more prone to it when I have someone else to accompany me. If you're looking for a gaming buddy or TV junkie you'll need to find it elsewhere, but I'm not fully opposed to sharing or talking about these things with someone either.
* **I live a very dynamic life and have since I was young.** I might stay up chatting until dawn one night and then be passed out by 5 PM the next one - likely because of the lack of sleep during the first. My pursuits, job, and other demands of my life are in constant flux. My resolution has always been to regulate these various needs and wants and to intensely focus on them when and if possible. I don't believe in being ""too busy"". You can always find time for someone, even if it's not consistent - finding that flow and appreciation of each other is vital.
* **I'm INTJ and am Type 5.** I only list these psychological evaluations because some people find them important or revealing. Personally, I find many of these sorts of tests to be bunk, although I do like studying myself and other people. It's a fun activity to share with those who are into it.

Are we looking for each other? **Doppelgängers are loved, but some of my best and most significant connections have been with people I had notable and vast dissimilarities with.** I'd greatly appreciate a reasonably lengthy chat/message in which you told me what within my ad resonated with you, what you're seeking, and anything else you may want to mention. I'll just end up asking about these things at some point anyway so it's simply more convenient and fluid if our conversation starts this way. I look forward to us chatting and connecting around meaningful and fervid passions.",1,1741493322.0,chat,0,1.0,False

I 33f been with my bf 35m for 2 years. He was my best friend and everything I ever wanted. Life's been rough for us both and all we seemed to have is eachother. 5 months ago he got custody of his daughter. Things changed understandably, he has other priorities now. He went from spending months straight at my house. To weekends. Ita a lot for him to get her to sitter 5am, then himself off to work If he stays here. Understandable. Sucks but I get it. So we really only see eachother weekends. But even that has become basically non existant. He'll spend a night and rush off in the morning always some excuse. Didn't see him for 2 weeks cuz his car broke down and he didn't wanna get an Uber here. He asks to spend the weekend with me and I'm happy. But same thing. He has to go help his mom not even 24 hours can we spend together. I miss him all the time. And it hurts I feel like he doesn't ever miss me. I honestly just feel like a burden. We spend months together straight and now he can't even give me the time of day. I'm happy he has his daughter and completely understand the dynamic changed. I tried to me patient to let them settle into their new life together and stuff. But 5 months and everything just gets worse every day. I'm tired of sleeping alone. I'm tired of feeling like a burden. I'm tired of having the title of a girlfriend but not being treated like one. I just done understand how he doesn't miss me and want to spend time with me too. I hate every second without him and he doesn't understand that though I'm happy he has his kid (i dont want to get that twisted i am) everything I've known this last two years has been ripped from out from under me and it feels like I've been discarded to the side. I'm really hurting because of it. And his excuse when I told him how I felt is ""I'm going through stuff your supposed to be there for me not complain I'm not there"" how am I supposed to be there I'd he won't let me in. And I'm going through stuff too sometimes it'd be nice if he'd be here.. he used ti be my safe space to rest after the day is done. I don't know If he just fell out of love with me. Doesn't think I'm good enough now for his new life. Or just wants to live life alone with bis child. And if he did that's fine. But I gave him an out when it started and said maybe this is too much now and he begged me to stay. Asked me to not give up on him and that he would make time for me. Would stop by in the mornings to bring me a coffee and kiss. But that only lasted a one week and hadn't happened since  now it's worse. I feel really pathetic begging a man for time and love. I know it'd beneath me. But he tells me different. But those are just words. I keep hanging on to them though hoping one day he'll wake up and look at me and want me like he used too so it's hard to let go. It's really doing a number on my self worth. I just cry myself asleep and am very lonely. Craving his companionship. Fuck anyone's at this point.

He invalidates my feelings anytime I'm not praising him and feel anything negative.idk how I'm supposed go be in a relationship with someone i see 4 times a month. Babrefly any sex or connection.

1j6z03e,https://www.reddit.com/r/UWMilwaukee/comments/1j6z03e/thinking_about_transferring_to_uwm_in_need_of/,"Thinking about transferring to UWM, in need of advice","Hey there! I’m looking at transferring to UWM from a private Christian school in West Michigan. Not loving their treatment of LGBTQ folks, and I just got dumped by my girlfriend, so I’m looking for a change. I’ve got a few questions:

1. Anyone here a part of the Film program? It speaks for itself, as far as I’m concerned. Top 20 in the US, top 50 in the world. I hear complaints that it’s “too experimental,” which in my mind is utter bullshit, even if it’s true. I’m not a filmmaker because I want to make movies. I’m a filmmaker because I want to make art. Miniature tangent aside, what has your experience been like? It’s worth noting that I’ve got some film classes under my belt, so I’d probably be taking 200/300 level classes for the major. I’m huge into making documentaries; as a matter of fact, I’m working on one right now. Also have a soft spot for more experimental, arthouse-type films.

2. I know UWM is primarily a commuter school. Seems comparable to my state school’s local extension campus (IU Indianapolis). But is it hard to find community on campus? I’m your standard artsy type with a bit of nerd and punk rocker thrown in and a heaping scoop of autism to finish it off. Love D&D, hardcore shows, art museums, and ranting about high speed rail for 45 straight minutes (that last part actually happened).

3. Purely out of curiosity, will I be curb-stomped for not liking the Packers? I mean, I don’t hate them. I’m just a die-hard Bills fan. Can live peacefully alongside mostly anyone, and I’m even happy to crap on the Bears (my ex’s team) with you cheeseheads. Is that enough, or do I need to worry about being tackled by a mob of angry men with beer bellies and Jordan Love jerseys? (I’m joking…mostly 👀)

Oh, and bonus question: best coffee in the 414? And if you really wanna go above and beyond, how about the worst coffee?

Thanks in advance for the help. You rock, friendly internet strangers! 🫡",1,1741492243.0,UWMilwaukee,1,1.0,False

My husband (we're both 51) is emotionally immature from abusive parents and suffers from anxiety and depression and is a hoarder. He's in treatment but only for medication-he claims he cant find a therapist but he's not actively trying either.

One of the things he does when he's got anxiety is that he uses me as his ""catch all"" for his emotions and tries to dump a lot of personal responsibilities on me. He becomes helpless and/or childlike and wants me involved in everything and holding his hand-things he is capable of doing now needs my input and partnership on but they are things that I should not be a part of, like him asking me if HE'S hungry....Um, your body-if you are hungry.....eat. Dumb things like that. It's draining me both mentally and physically because when he gets anxious, it's a constant checklist of things I need to partake in. I'm a walking security blanket.

I've been creating boundaries and sticking with them when he gets like this and he's been getting aggressive when I don't give in. Not physically but verbally-like a tantrum. The more I stand my ground, the angrier he gets. Eventually when he realizes that he's not getting me to jump, he will back off but it leaves me angry and drained. His mom behaves this way as well and it works for her so I know exactly where he got it from.

Today, he pulled some stupid shit. We're gearing up for a big job for a few days. I'm also working on his business taxes so I'm juggling that, trying to clean the house to make it presentable for our house sitters (living with a hoarder) and a great deal of physical pain and stress.

He has a competition that he's going to this weekend. He was going out early to help with setting up the event so he had no set time to be there but as he's leaving, he says to me ""we need coffee-I need you to get coffee"".

Coffee is HIS chore. I don't buy the coffee, ever. I don't even know what kind we have. That's 100% his responsibility so saying this was weird.

So I tell him to stop by the store and pick some up before he heads over to the event. At that point, he went from love to tantrum with complaining about how he has ""no time"" to go (even though he did) and said ""fine, I guess we won't have coffee tomorrow"", which doesn't bother me because I don't always drink it.

I say that I'll be ok without coffee tomorrow if he can't get any....so he gets angrier.

Then he starts to gaslight me by saying something about how we didn't go food shopping this week so clearly it's my fault that we don't have any coffee even though I do all the food shopping and never buy coffee because that's his chore.

I point out that out to him and he gets even angrier.

This goes back and forth until I flat out say ""I'm not going to get coffee for you-that's your responsibility and I can't keep taking on more and more of your responsibilities. I'm not going to the store-pick up coffee yourself or we don't have any tomorrow. I'm fine either way"".

He gave up and left pissed but he calls me at the event like nothing happened. I'm pretty sure he stopped to pick up the coffee but why go through all of this shit? Am I the asshole for not giving in?",1,1741492009.0,AITAH,9,1.0,False

Chapter 4, Day 4:

“MMRRROOOOOW!!!”

“Naiami…”

“OH MAYA!” 

7:30 AM, the clutter of sounds jolts Maya awake.  Although she was on vacation, her cat’s feeding schedule wasn’t. Maya clumsily gets up from the lack of sleep to feed the cat, not before getting spooked by Mymy right in front of the door. 

“Mymy, we’re just visiting. You don’t need to-“

“Actually, I just wanted to tell you that I got three tickets for Walibi Holland!”

“Oh! Thanks Mymy.”

Seeing Mymy still in her pajamas, Maya felt comfortable enough to leave the study without getting ready. Her unbrushed hair and unwashed face was not a sight, but Naiami knows she needs food.

“Good morning girls, I made you favorites.”

Mymy and Maya emerge to the dining table, seeing a breakfast-feast their mother made. The table has Naiami’s cat food, Stroopwaffles, tea, coffee, chocolate bread, eggs, and Kruidnoten. However, with Coco still not up, there feels like there's something missing to the feast. The Kruidnoten watches Maya with an evil glee, and Maya gestures to Mymy. The girls start eating, as Mymy eats the Kruidnoten for Maya. 

“So, what are you girls doing today?”

“Well, I have three tickets for Walibi Holland, but I don't know who else to bring…”, Mymy says in confusion 

Maya quickly has an idea.

“Do you think Coco would like to go?”

Right! Walibi Holland! That amusement park was the one park that Coco always loved going to. After all, it was always the family’s default theme park for an outing. Coco always tried to urge Maya into playing whatever games her and Mymy were playing.

“I don’t think Coco would like it.”

“Why?”

“She now likes these… films?... It is where an Ugly man kisses a pretty girl…”

As the mom starts to explain what type of “films” Coco watches, Maya sinks her head into her hands. She knows exactly what her mom is talking about, as Mymy turns red in secondhand embarrassment. 

“...she watches a lot of those strange films now. That’s all she does! Bed and film, like a child!”

“That, was a little too elaborate for me, mom.” Maya says, holding back her cringe.

“Sorry girls, did you like the food?”

“We loved it mom!” Mymy says, quickly breaking the awkward aroma

“I’m glad it was good.”

“Are you sure Coco wouldn't like Walibi now?”

“I guess you can try, Maya.”

Maya dashes off to the bathroom to get ready as Mymy cleans up everything, Hair, Makeup, clothes, and perfect! Maya looks at herself in her favorite outfit, excited to see the old theme park with her two sisters. However, Maya remembers that she can’t bring Naiami. But before, time to wake Coco. Maya knocks on Coco’s door and slowly creeks it open.

“Good morning Coco\~”

“Mrnfing…”

“I know you’re tired, but would you like to go to Walibi Holland with me and Mymy?”

Coco perks up, a place of the past excites her. She thinks of the new and old rides, and decides to go. However, she still felt that weight weighing down on her, on how nobody would give a failure something.

“I’ll give you… 10 more minutes. Just be up by eight, ok?”

Coco nods, and goes back to sleep…

“Ten more minutes… I really turned into a child…”

Mymy’s in the bathroom with Maya’s phone, so Maya just decides to get it over with and asks her mom if Naiami can stay at home.

“Maya, because Coco will be out, the cat isn’t going anywhere.”

With an uneasy affirmation, Maya asks Mymy to hurry up for Coco. She goes back into Coco’s room to wake her up, and Coco slowly gets up.

“Coco, this will be fun. I promise.”

“You don’t know that”

“Well, it will because I haven’t spent any time with you in 4 years\~!”

“I-I guess so?”

\[Bullshit.\] Coco thought. \[Complete Bullshit, when has Maya enjoyed doing anything that didn’t involve a computer? She never enjoyed doing anything with me anyway…\]

Maya waits for Mymy to finish, so she can finish getting ready in her study. By the time Mymy emerges, it’s already 8:20 AM, and they need to leave around 9:10-9:30. Maya grabs her stuff to let Coco freshen up, and goes to study with Naiami to finish getting ready. When everyone is done, Maya and Mymy go out to the car to wait for Coco.

“I’m guessing you drove here?”

“I only live in Drenthe, it ain't far from here.”

“Then you’re driving to the park”

“Maya, I already did enough driving.”

“Well, I am not dealing with Dutch traffic.”

“Fair, but isn’t Antwerp worse?”

“I’d say it’s better.”

“Oh… I-I wouldn’t think that… ever.”

Coco emerges from the house, with only a slightly different appearance of a different colored dress, and some black tennis shoes.

“Now Maya, don’t ghost us again, alright?” Her mom said with a half-joking half-serious tone

“I won’t mom, or will any of us.”

\[Ghost… ghost… Why would mom mention that?\] Maya thought.

  The girls buckled in as Mymy started the car. Mymy looked at Maya with a mischievous look to try to get her to drive, but failed. Mymy started to drive off, trying at every single moment to convince Maya to drive. Maya ignores every single attempt, as Coco is unreacting to Mymy’s antics. Maya looks out the window, the scenery feels like Deja Vu, the trees, the children playing, and the occasional run-down shops. The Woodland declines, and  Walibi Holland emerges like a mountain in a valley. Mymy finds a parking spot as best as she can with the tourists, and shuts off the car.

  The girls get out, with Coco dragging behind. Maya forgot how wonderful this place actually was, finally seeing the park’s daytime glow cast a ray of joy on her. She keeps up at pace with Coco as Mymy dashes off to find a place in line as it rapidly gets longer. Mymy dashes to the last spot before the line becomes unbearable, with Coco still lagging behind. Eventually, Maya just drags Coco to Mymy to secure the spot. The line drags on, with time becoming slower by the steps of the people. The gate eventually peers through, and Mymy checks all three of them in.   
  
  The park inside looks to Maya as it would seeing heaven, the park feels a lot larger than before, the people are enjoying every moment of themselves, and the games are in abundance. However, the roller coasters look more like a challenge than a one-way ticket to hell. Mymy’s eyes dilate, and Maya gets ready to experience something new with Coco.

“Coco! Wanna join?”

“I-I guess…”

Maya thought some familiarity would help Coco regain her life, after all, it would be nice to make up for all of the missed years. Maya and Mymy run like free-spirited teenagers, as Coco tries to keep up. The first thing they all see is a hardcore roller-coaster, in which Maya internally gags on. However, the coaster with a fun-looking exterior clicks to them like magnets, and Coco is once again forced to join. Mymy starts to slightly lose her shit at the sight of the old theme park, and Maya quickly gets her on the coaster. Realizing whats about to happen, the coaster blasts off like a rocket. For the entire ride, Maya sees the things she couldn’t when she was younger, like the bliss of every group at the park, or how everybody seems to be having a great time, maybe even the scenery of the woodlands. Maya and Mymy play almost every fair game they see, until Maya sees Coco’s favorite game.

“Coco?”

“Mmm-?”

“Do you think you can beat your last score there?” Maya says as she gestures towards the punching bag.

“N-no”

“But you’re still strong, Right?”

“I mean, well…”

“Coco! I wanna see!”

“Well, I can’t even do rugby anymore…”

“Well, that doesn't mean you’ve lost that much strength!”

Coco, convinced, goes over to the punching bag. With Maya’s delusion, she believes that there truly was no way for Coco to ever lose her strength.

BAM!

|SCORE: 300|

BAM!

|SCORE: 307|

BAM!

|SCORE: 310|

Maya and Mymy look at the score in disbelief, as Coco’s strength was truly no more. Her highscore from 900-1000, has gone down to barely over 300. Something that only Mymy could punch that weak.

“I fucking knew it…”

“Hey, Coco, there’s-”

“I need to sit for a while.”

“Alright, come join if you’d like then…”

With Maya losing hope, Mymy directs her to the one game she was always good at. It was obviously the target shooter, they both got their guns ready, and wallets out, to hopefully gain a bear.

“So, Mymy, what is it about you bio-sister”

“Bio-sister?”

“Yeah, I thought you hated her? You didn’t tell me you forgave her”

“Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you all about her and me. So, her name is Eiko, and she messaged me in December… 2020!”

“Why?”

“It turns out she was looking for me, she apparently wanted to find me again.”

“After you ran away?”

“Yep!”

“Why would she want to connect with you if-”

“Now that was the mystery! Turns out our bio-parents are total assholes! Eiko doesn’t like our bio-parents, and was really lonely.”

“So she reached out to you because…?”

“She wanted a relationship with me!”

“That’s sweet, so do you visit her in Japan?”

“No, my Japanese isn’t good enough.”

“Is it like a 6-year olds?” Maya jokingly says

“Haha! Well, it’s more like the problem is that my Japanese is at a B2 level, and I at least need a C2 to visit Eiko’s place.”

“Never expected you to do that!”

“Do what?”

“Connect with Eiko.”

“I didn’t either!”

Maya changes gears in her brain, ready to confront Mymy about her secrecy.

“Mymy, like Eiko… why did you hide all those things?”

“What things?”

“Oh I don’t know, you lying about being famous, Eiko, Boyfriend status… why did you do that!?”

BAM- “CLOSE!” The mechanical voice says

“Well, I just forgot to tell you!”

“We’ve been texting since I moved out! We are in our early twenties Mymy!”

“I-I told you! I just forgot!” 

BAM!- Mymy tries to hold back her tears and the real reason

“Do you still view me as a child?!”

“No!”

“Then why do you keep secrets?! Nobody texted me except for my friends, you, and mom and dad you secretive bitch!”

“Maya I-”

“What, do you think i'm too much of a-”

BAM!

The lights go off, as Mymy’s face starts to well up with tears. The worker doesn't even notice Mymy’s stifled upset expression, and gives Maya her prize.

“I-I-I…”

Maya feels slightly anxious seeing Mymy about to cry, “Ok, Mymy, let's sit with Coco? Ok?”

They go sit with Coco, still in the same position since a few hours ago. Mymy starts having the tears flow, as the reason starts to forcefully break through.

“It’s because you ghosted us…”

“Ghosted? I never-”

“You disappeared for three days straight when you first moved to Belgium.”

“Well, Lina couldn’t pay internet that month so I had to get a-”

“I know t-the story, Maya.” Mymy says as she quickly faces away from Maya to hide her tears.

“Lina couldn’t pay for the internet, so you had to get a job to help and bla bla bla… YOU COULD’VE STILL USED THE LOBBY’S WIFI! Or… I don't know! Talk to a neighbor, or go to a coffee shop or just anything!”

Maya tries to give a hand to Mymy, but she moves away,

“You traumatized the entire family, Maya. You were seventeen when you disappeared that one night…”

Maya’s memory completely blocked out that detail. She forgot the rage she felt that night she decided to live with Lina. She forgot how poor Lina was when she invited Maya to live with her. She forgot her very first days in Belgium. She puts her hand back, and her expression changes to shame as she hears Mymy stifling and sniffling. She finally realized how badly she messed up.

“Mymy…”

“Y-yeah..?”

“I don’t like the way you don't tell me things like-” Maya takes a quick break “like the way I ghost people…”

Mymy turned around to face Maya, with her eyes slightly red with some mascara down her face. She realized Maya was genuinely sorry, but the wound of not seeing her sister physically was still there. 

“Mymy… I really am sorry, I-”

Mymy quickly hugs Maya, and Maya returns the favor. They give each other a good, long forgiving hug. Maya checks Mymy if she’s ok to drive. Although the wound was still there, it was finally starting to heal. Mymy decides to go to the car in the sunset to get it ready.

“And I wasn’t even worth talking to…”

Coco’s wound hasn't healed even remotely after today. However, there are still more days to go get Coco on her feet. The girls get situated in the car, tired after a long day in the park. With new understanding, they drive home. When they get there, Maya slowly opens the door through fear Naiami might be gone. Her mom answers the door and sighs.

“Come in. Maya, I hope you're not mad at what dad did with the cat.”

   Maya looks at her dad with the cat in his lap and starts laughing. The cat is completely dressed up, with clothes scattered all over the floor. Naiami looks defeated on her dad, and they both start laughing together as they spend time with the cat. They play and dress up the cat as her mom shakes her head on how ridiculous the cat looks. Mymy eventually joins the family for some time with the cat. Maya and Mymy soon freshen up, with their dad now wanting a cat. Everyone retires for the night, and Mymy visits Maya one last time.

“Goodnight Maya!”

“Goodnight Mymy.”

“Just remember the class reunion is tomorrow!”

\[The reunion… right. You can’t visit without going to that reunion… oh god…\] Maya thought nervously as she hugged her cat. She knew that although she was visiting family, Mymy would still make her go to the reunion. Maya fell asleep anxiously, unknowing of what was to become of her classmates. Or, as a matter of fact, how they would even treat Maya now.",2,1741491741.0,ongezellig,0,1.0,False

1j6yn8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/digimarketeronline/comments/1j6yn8l/what_are_the_advantages_of_using_facebook_groups/,What are the advantages of using Facebook groups for marketing?,"Facebook Groups are a **powerful but underrated** tool for businesses looking to build brand loyalty, engage with their audience, and drive sales. Unlike traditional Facebook Pages, Groups allow for **direct, community-driven interactions** that foster **trust and long-term customer relationships**.

# 1. Builds a Loyal Community Around Your Brand

✅ Unlike Facebook Pages, Groups allow for **two-way conversations** rather than just one-way promotions.  
✅ Members feel like they’re part of an **exclusive club**, increasing their loyalty to your brand.

🔹 **Example:** A fitness brand creates a **“Members-Only Fitness Challenge” Group**, where customers share progress, tips, and motivation—keeping them engaged and invested.

**💡 Actionable Tip:**

* Create a **private group** for VIP customers or brand enthusiasts.
* Encourage **discussions, live Q&As, and exclusive content**.

# 2. Increases Organic Reach & Engagement

✅ Facebook’s algorithm prioritizes **Group content** over brand Pages.  
✅ Posts from Groups **appear more frequently in users' feeds**, ensuring **higher visibility** without needing to spend on ads.

🔹 **Example:** A skincare brand’s Facebook Group gets **thousands of organic interactions**, while their Page’s posts get **minimal reach unless boosted with ads**.

**💡 Actionable Tip:**

* Post **discussion-based content** (e.g., polls, debates, user-generated content) to boost organic engagement.
* Encourage members to **ask questions, share experiences, and interact**.

# 3. Encourages User-Generated Content (UGC) & Social Proof

✅ People trust **real customer testimonials and experiences** more than ads.  
✅ Groups are perfect for collecting **UGC, reviews, and success stories** from loyal fans.

🔹 **Example:** A beauty brand encourages customers to **share makeup looks** using their products, turning them into **brand ambassadors**.

**💡 Actionable Tip:**

* Run **challenges or contests** that encourage users to post their experiences with your product.
* Pin the best **testimonials or customer stories** to the top of the Group.

# 4. Drives Sales Through Exclusive Offers & Product Launches

✅ Groups create a sense of **exclusivity**, making members more likely to buy.  
✅ Businesses can **launch new products, offer early access, or give group-only discounts** to drive conversions.

🔹 **Example:** A clothing brand offers Group members **a 24-hour early access sale**, increasing urgency and sales.

**💡 Actionable Tip:**

* Offer **special discounts & early-bird access** to new products for group members.
* Create **VIP shopping experiences** only available within the Group.

# 5. Boosts Customer Support & Brand Trust

✅ Groups allow customers to **ask questions, get support, and connect with other users**.  
✅ This reduces the workload on your customer service team while improving the **customer experience**.

🔹 **Example:** A SaaS company uses a Facebook Group as a **support forum**, where users help each other and share troubleshooting tips.

**💡 Actionable Tip:**

* Appoint **brand advocates or community managers** to answer common questions.
* Use the **Group as an FAQ hub** to reduce customer service requests.

# 6. Creates a Direct Feedback Loop for Business Improvement

✅ Groups provide **real-time insights** into customer opinions, needs, and challenges.  
✅ Brands can use feedback to **improve products, marketing strategies, and customer experience**.

🔹 **Example:** A coffee brand asks its Group members what **new flavor they should launch**, ensuring customer demand before production.

**💡 Actionable Tip:**

* Run **polls & surveys** to gather valuable market insights.
* Ask members for **feedback on new ideas, features, or services**.

# 7. Strengthens Brand Authority & Thought Leadership

✅ A well-managed Group positions your business as an **industry leader**.  
✅ Sharing **valuable insights, expert content, and engaging discussions** builds credibility and trust.

🔹 **Example:** A digital marketing agency runs a **Facebook Group for small business owners**, sharing **free growth tips & case studies** to attract new clients.

**💡 Actionable Tip:**

* Share **exclusive content**, like behind-the-scenes insights, industry trends, and expert advice.
* Host **live sessions, Q&A discussions, and expert interviews**.

# Conclusion

Facebook Groups are a **powerful marketing tool** for businesses looking to **increase organic reach, build strong customer relationships, and drive sales**—without relying heavily on paid ads. By **fostering community engagement, encouraging user-generated content, and offering exclusive experiences**, brands can turn Group members into **loyal customers and brand advocates**.",1,1741491034.0,digimarketeronline,0,1.0,False

1j6ymea,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j6ymea/i_dont_know_who_i_am_anymore/,I don’t know who I am anymore,"Okay so little backstory I’m 21M from Canada, all throughout high school I had this crush and we had a very good connection, good chemistry, but for some reason things just never lined up properly and we just remained friends until the last semester of high school we started dating. Our connection continued to grow stronger and we grew closer and then she left for college 8 hour drive away from me. We had our struggles at first learning how to maintain a long distance relationship, but I was always fighting to make things work when she would tend to want to run. 

Anyways I wasn’t in college yet so I just worked and I’d spend every paycheque to go down and see her every two weeks pretty much, if she needed me I would drop everything and drive down. I put everything I had into this girl. I ended up going to school in January and went to a school an hour and a half away from her so I could see her more. 

My second semester of school started when her second semester ended so she came and stayed with me for the summer in a student house I was renting. I payed for everything rent groceries whatever. At this point we had grown so close we were constantly talking about our future together. We loved each-other so much. 

After the summer my program was done and we got an apartment in the town she went to school in. I got a job and we split everything 50/50. She ended up dropping out of school because she was going through a tough time and  she didn’t like her program and just took a little break to work and figure out what she wanted to do. We got a cat together and things were great.

I had friends back home that I would go see often, but she would never come with me, we were different people and it was chocked up to I liked to party with my friends and she was more of a stay at home body. But she had nothing but trust for me and there was never any problems or doubts I had lots of friends that were girls and everyone was always so surprised how chill and trusting she was. 

A year goes by and I start to get some seasonal depression pretty bad, I started smoking weed more and taking less care of the house and Halloween night she was going out with her new friends from school, and I was laying in bed by myself while they pregamed at our apartment when I overheard her say she was planning on breaking up with me. I texted her to tell her friends to leave and they did and we talked about it. Obviously I was destroyed hearing something like that but I wanted to know why she was saying this.

She told me she’d been planning it for a while and it’s because my mental health issues and because I smoked too much and we were having communication issues lately. I told her that these are things that can be fixed and that I don’t think we should give up because of that. So the next day I quit smoking, I got a prescription for antidepressants, and we worked on communication, things were looking good.

A week after Halloween she told me that it’s over. I was so tired so I agreed, I told her I’d pack everything up and move home in the morning, quit my job and told my mom I was moving back home, she wanted to sleep in the same bed and I told her I didn’t think that was a good idea, we got in a fight about who should keep the cat and I gave in and told her she could. She left for the night to go stay at a friends and I packed and left the next morning. 

We tried to stay friends, but she’d block me out of no where and then unblock me a couple weeks later saying I miss you I want you to come back, I can’t even imagine being with anyone else but you. I felt the same way but tried to act more rationally, I would tell her we need time to work on ourselves. She came back for Christmas and we hooked up and she told me she hadn’t been with anyone, that it makes her sick even thinking about it. 

A few months go by of the same thing, and eventually she was getting mad at me one night because she thought I was sleeping with a friend of hers from high school who she didn’t even talk to anymore (I wasn’t) but anyways she ends up telling me she felt guilty about something, when I asked what she told me that she had been going out to the bar and having one night stands, I think she said three different times but idk. I was hurt and told her I needed some time to process that, we ended the call and I blocked her for the first time. 

3 months go by and I unblock her and tell her I want to talk, she told me everything I wanted to hear, that she’s sorry she lied and that she did only want me but it was a confusing time. I understood but was obviously very hurt, I was still hopeful that maybe she’d still be in my future again one day tho, she told me she was coming home in a few weeks and that we could meet for coffee

The day of our meetup is approaching and she had bocked me again, I was done now. But a couple days later she called me saying her car broke down on the highway and she didn’t know what to do, I told her off and blocked her on everything, I was done with being played with for her benefit.

A year goes by and I thought about it her and us a lot. I came to the conclusion that she had never loved me unconditionally, but only loved what I could provide to her, whether that be financially security, confidence, sex or car help lol. Our whole relationship She would say she would love me and want to be with me no matter what. She would say we were ride or die. And that’s what I wanted. At first it wasn’t like that, I almost had to fight for unconditional love. And I realized that it was just all fake. 

After a year of having her blocked I came to the realization that I never heard her side of the story, that I came to all those conclusions by myself and out of a place of anger. I realized that I may have misunderstood, so I decided to unblock her and send her a message

Long story short we decided to give our relationship another try, we really thought it out, had a lot of big convos, and after a couple months decided we wanted to try again.

I wasn’t going to let her get away this time so I put everything into her, I sent her flowers and coffees regularly, and I’d send her random bigger gifts like skims etc. and I’d go down to see her again doing the long journey. Everything was good, better than it was before, and I was so confident that we made the right decision.

About 5 months go by and she called me saying she wanted to break up, no real reason was given but I let her go, I had come to the conclusion that if she didn’t want me I wasn’t going to waste all my energy trying to make it work again. I blocked her immediately after we ended the call out of frustration. 

A week later I found out through a friend that she had cheated on me and then broke up with me to be with her new man. That was two months ago and I haven’t felt like myself since. 

I realized that I was right the first time and she’d just been playing me the whole time. I feel so stupid. Like I’ve spent the past 8 years chasing after this girl and building up such history with her, just for her to play me the entire time and me not realize it. Only now I realized that I was the only one that would really plan dates, that majority of the effort came from me. I just feel so stupid that I put so much effort into getting played and manipulated like that. 

I was always such a confident person, I was funny and charismatic. After I found out about that^ all those characteristics went away, I struggle to make eye contact with girls now. It’s been three months and all I can think about is how much I hate her. I can’t sleep at night because all I can think about is what I would say to her if I ever saw her again, about all the ways she did me wrong, it consumes me.

1j6yhfv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1j6yhfv/beyond_the_cracks/,Beyond the Cracks,"""It's almost time."" I thought to myself as I strolled past a bunch of paint workers repainting the slightly tarnished walls of a government building. Walls that had hardly been clawed by a bird. They would probably be the least in need of a paint job in the town. The stench of the fresh paint slightly lingering on me as I swiftly walked past it, my eyes tracing the long and deepening crack in the tilled footpath, a reminder of my crumbling resolve. The seemingly straight edges bulged into squiggly lines— probably due to my nervousness, fast pace, and weak eyesight. I didn't pay heed to it. 
Previous mistakes had led to this and now I just had to get past the college.
""What am I doing?"", wimpered a trembling voice that was consumed instantly by the incoming traffic. I was determined not to stop. 
I saw the roof of the cafe that recently opened in the area, sparkling like marble in the morning sun. Its doors, wide open, seemed inviting to the early day crowd. I entered without a hint of hesitation and the moment my eyes landed on a barista I made sure to give a quick order for coffee. The cup rattled in my hands as it were handed over to me by the girl with remnants of a smile on her face.
A few baristas were arranging the freshly baked goods on the aisle while a manager stood nearby, overseeing them and giving instructions authoritatively.
I took a seat.

I had skipped an exam that day.

My eyes soaked the glimpse of a weakly phrased ""Where are you?"" and I turned my phone screen off in what seemed like one hundredth of a second.
My heart dropped like a collapsing twentieth story building. The air grew warmer for a moment. Soon I realised it was my own breath heating the air.

I stared into the stretch of road outside which was slowly beginning to beam with traffic. It looked hazier as the passing cars left trails of dust.

It was time. The exam must've started. I had successfully ditched it. My shameless conscience let out a cry of joy as my guilty self shoved it into a tomb and silenced it.

The truth was simple: I wasn't prepared. 

The stretch of time that felt like being unearthed  by my own self-deprecating sight lasted for about an hour and a half. 

No sooner than that I had walked to my room pacing over the cracks on the path, barring my sight from them. A relief lingering in my chest perhaps one that's more physical than emotional. My body was relieved of the tension.

Upon reaching my room, I found it cluttered with worn clothes and ripped handwritten notes. I had to unwillingly inform my parents, who waited for a response regularly, that the exams have subsided, creating a false assumption that I had attended them. As I spoke to them my image crumbled in my own eyes. As I held those words rigidly in my tongue and spoke with a shameless demeanor I wanted to disown myself as their daughter.
I however didn't do any of those. I muttered the lies and put down the phone. 
I was reminded of the innocently fabricated and nurturing smile that I had sensed through the phone. They believed me. Why wouldn't they? My heart sank as I sat down and shed an instant tear which to my surprise barely hit the sheets on the bed. Perhaps relief had overshadowed my grief, leaving me with peace that seemed calming as well as distasteful.
That was the moment I despised myself beyond any might.

BTC has become so horribly inefficient that the use case for it has gone from a payment system that will revolutionize microtransactions in the beginning to a 'store of value/hedge against inflation' that consumes more energy than entire countries. It does not work as a hedge against inflation either, it just follows the direction of the stock market at an accelerated rate. Not to mention that deflationary economies are doomed to fail. 

Coffee has seen some shit over the years, I don't understand how someone with a good head on their shoulders can still see a bright future at this point for crypto. Only thing I can think of is if he were to say that he didn't believe in the future of crypto then he'd be called a no-coiner and people would be less likely to take him serious (the crypto community looks down on 'no-coiners').",13,1741490439.0,Coffeezilla_gg,7,0.84,False

Their stories, their perspective, etc. Looks can be very deceiving with people, and I like to find out the real them instead of just making assumptions. 

I had this idea from watching a few strangers while I was at a coffee shop today. A man was sitting outside at a table drinking his coffee. A woman was looking for a table, and there weren't any available. The man said to her ""You can sit here and join me until another table opens up if you would like"". The woman obliged. She sat down and they just started talking to each other casually and learning little things about each other. They may have a ton of things in common, they may have nothing in common. They may share similar perspective, they may be able to provide each other with a different side of the coin. 

I would like to gauge interest. I would like to try and set up a meetup once a week with...whoever would like to join. It could be a one on one meetup, it could be a 3 or 4 person meet up, etc. I just dont think it should exceed three or four people, at least initially. 

I dont know anything about you, you dont know anything about me. Lets meet up and learn. Young, old, athletic, artsy, whatever gender you identify as, etc. 

I want to go into this as blind as possible. Maybe you are a sweet grandma who can tell me about your life and I can relate with some things and tell you about mine? Maybe maybe you are a 20 year old guy who is really into basketball? Maybe you are a ""valley girl"" who is actually into metal music? Maybe you are a doctor? Etc. 

I would love to meet up with someone over a cup of coffee (or whatever you drink) and a snack for maybe half an hour or an hour and just...see what happens. 

If this ends up being popular / a success, maybe we could all come together and create something bigger eventually, but as for now I would like to more close/intimate one on one, or 3-4 people total conversations. 

If anyone is interested please DM me and we can exchange contact information to set it up. 

As of now, im thinking about a coffee shop called Priscilla's. Its on the Burbank / Toluca Lake border near the studios. I will be there around lets say..... 1pm on Sunday, March 16th. 

Let me know what yall think!

I thought to myself as I strolled past a bunch of paint workers repainting the slightly tarnished walls of a government building. Walls that had hardly been clawed by a bird. They would probably be the least in need of a paint job in the town. The stench of the fresh paint slightly lingering on me as I swiftly walked past it, my eyes tracing the long and deepening crack in the tilled footpath, a reminder of my crumbling resolve. The seemingly straight edges bulged into squiggly lines— probably due to my nervousness, fast pace, and weak eyesight. I didn't pay heed to it. 
Previous mistakes had led to this and now I just had to get past the college.
""What am I doing?"", wimpered a trembling voice that was consumed instantly by the incoming traffic. I was determined not to stop. 
I saw the roof of the cafe that recently opened in the area, sparkling like marble in the morning sun. Its doors, wide open, seemed inviting to the early day crowd. I entered without a hint of hesitation and the moment my eyes landed on a barista I made sure to give a quick order for coffee. The cup rattled in my hands as it were handed over to me by the girl with remnants of a smile on her face.
A few baristas were arranging the freshly baked goods on the aisle while a manager stood nearby, overseeing them and giving instructions authoritatively.
I took a seat.

I had skipped an exam that day.

I’ve been nomading for a couple of years now after living in Ohio (born, raised, college) > CLT > NYC > CHI (12 yrs) > SEA > LOU KY. 

Landed in Louisville during the pandemic and somehow got stuck. Finding the dating scene and general Catholic family / closed mindedness / clique nature not a great fit for me (although this city is def blue in a red state, just too much group think and southern shit talking behind each others backs). I’m super close to family geographically here (Cincy) but not that close to my family in terms of how much I see them.  Have a great house that I would consider keeping and renting. 

I’ve been nomading and living in diff cities to try to find my fit. Lived in Denver, Nashville, Asheville, Atlanta and somehow still unable to make a decision. I think I narrowed down to Denver or Asheville, but hoping the hive mind here can help me!

Things that are important to me: 
- connecting with like minded people, being able to build a community where people want to have deep, not just surface level relationships 
- mental health - trauma based therapy, talking about emotions
- dating - I’m single, bi-curious (was straight), 44, female 
- music - I love live music, especially jam bands and bluegrass music. 
- hiking and access to trails - I love getting outdoors and hiking
- dog friendly - I want nice trails or sidewalks to take my dog out everyday and would love breweries or coffee shops that are dog friendly inside
- weather - Chicago killed me, I just can’t do that cold anymore. I want to enjoy winter and be able to go outside
- COL - I would love a nice house with a yard for my dog under $650k. I have a remote job in tech (no return to office planned). 
- Yoga community - would love a great studio to practice regularly in
- Bonus: Good airport preferred, and would love boating available nearby 

I’m concerned Denver is too dry / brown (I missed the green and water access when I lived there) and way too far from my family (although we aren’t super close, but I will travel there often and won’t be able to drive). I’m also worried that it will be hard to make friends, Denver ppl don’t seem as overly nice and open to conversation. 

Asheville was amazing for meeting people and connection, I’m worried it’s too small for dating, lack of access to healthcare, and the airport will be annoying (lack of direct flights), and it’s in a red state. 

I just left Asheville after a month and it really grew on me, so I’m heading back to Denver to re-evaluate. 

Am I missing a city that should be in the consideration set? Any advice between Asheville and Denver? I’ve been debating this move for over two years and just need to decide!

Every time I try to log in, I lose a piece of my soul. I don’t even want to be here—I’m just trying to check my timetable, see if my tutorial has been moved for the 5th time, or access a lecture recording because I was too busy disassociating in class. But no. Before I can do anything, Okta stands at the gates like a smug little goblin, demanding tribute.

It always starts the same way. I enter my uni email, feeling hopeful, naïve. Then comes the password. Do I actually remember it this time? Of course not. My brain is already overloaded with memorizing content that will vanish from my memory the second the exam ends. No room for passwords. I try a few variations before giving up and resetting it again.

Finally, it works. I breathe a sigh of relief. Then Okta tells me my session has expired. I have not even been here for five seconds. I try again. This time, it decides I need MFA. Fine. Whatever. I click “Send Push Notification” and stare at my phone.

Except there’s no notification. Nothing. I wait. I turn my phone off and on. Still nothing. Then I realize—I have to manually open the Okta app. Okay. Fine. I open it, expecting to just approve the login. But no. Now it’s showing me a random number, and I have to type that into the website myself. Why? Why must I be an active participant in my own suffering? I frantically look back at my laptop, trying to remember the numbers before my brain deletes them like a corrupted file. I type them in. Correct.

But then, Okta logs me out again. Because apparently, this is a thing I have to do every. single. time.

Like, why is my own uni treating me like a cybercriminal just for trying to access Canvas??? Just let me suffer in peace 😭

It doesn’t matter that I just did this 15 minutes ago, it doesn’t matter that I’ve been on the same page for 30 seconds—Okta doesn’t trust me, and neither does my university. Every single login feels like I’m in some sort of digital battle, constantly being kicked out and forced to go through the same excruciating process. I swear, getting into the Pentagon would be easier than this.

And the worst part? After all of this, after fighting for my life just to log in, the only thing waiting for me is some pointless announcement like ""Hey guys, just a reminder that the assignment is due today!"" As if I wasn’t already deep in the throes of academic panic.

I am one Okta failure away from dropping out and moving to the mountains to live off the land. I didn’t sign up for this. I signed up for education, not digital hostage negotiations. But here I am, bargaining with a login page like it holds my family at ransom.

Doctor didn't say t1 or t2, but I can only assume I'm t2 as I have to take pills, but don't have to give myself insulin injections..my reading at the time of blood work was 9.8. My lowest read to date since was 5.7. however, it keeps fluctuating, which of course will happen, but to me it seems to be more drastic than it should. For example, the read I did after the 5.7 was 6.9. Maybe this is normal when it fluctuates? I really dont understand what I'm doing wrong. There seems to be so much conflicting information it's kind of difficult to navigate. I do have an appointment soon with what I assume is a dietitian to help me with this, but the doctor told me absolutely nothing about this condition except see you in three months. This has gotten me so frustrated to the point of tears at times because I feel defeated. I'm trying really hard to get a handle on this and just when I think I'm doing good, I get a high reading and don't know why as I try to keep my food and drink relatively similar until I get a handle on this. I know I was crazy bad for the amount of pop I drank before this. Like all I drank aside from my morning coffee. As soon as I found this out, I stopped. I mostly drink water now. However, l have been allowing myself a small glass of diet or zero every so often because when I read the label, it seemed like it should be okay. Am I wrong in this? Also, I have cut out white sugar as much as I can, I use monk fruit sweetener, and only a small amount, which seemed to be the best one. Am I screwing myself over by using this as well? I substitute as much as I can. My weight has gone down some. Yet I still feel like I'm in way over my head. I'm a smart girl and can normally figure stuff out on my own, but this is beyond me. How to calculate everything, what I'm supposed to be counting for food intake. Honestly, I've just been trying to avoid anything that is above 5% of daily intake as much as I can. I don't eat much at all. I don't have time for breakfast, I try to eat lunch(but not every day),  but I do eat supper. There's no binge eating as it's extremely rare that I even finish my supper. I've always been this way. I also try to exercise 5 times a week, but sometimes it's only 4. I was also very bad for using a lot of salt, and some of those stats were high(i.e. cholesterol), and she gave me pills for that. I have also completely cut out salt as much as I can. I apologize for this post being so long, and I'm hoping I'm posting this in the right group. I know I'm forgetting some stuff I wanted to ask, but this is the jist of it. I just need some help or any advice people can give me. I figured this may be a good source to get that as I can get actual input from people dealing with the same thing.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

3/8/25 Meeting Minutes

1. Introductory comments by Kat Henry, Community Outreach for Do Something. Introduced: Tracey Steele, Communications Coordinator; Mat Thornton, Faith Coordinator; Jackie Evans, Volunteer Coordinator; Joe Schwartz, Project Development; Aaron Rhodes and Scott McCray, Veteran Coordinators. 

2. Meeting agenda/outline.  

3. Why we are here. [Notes from the presenter]

I think we can all see what is happening on the national stage.  

We know there is already direct impact on our community. 

We know people who have lost their jobs.  

People trying to figure out how to keep their medical coverage for their children or sick spouses.  

others who have had outside medical treatments and tests suspended as the work force is stripped bare or VA services halter.

Today, Many people are afraid they will lose their Medicare, Medicaid, social security or Food Assistance benefits. 

The list can go on and on. 

It is easy to feel powerless and become paralyzed. To do nothing. 

We decided that it was time to stop doom scrolling and complaining on the internet and get up and do something. To put our actions where our ideas are.  

First, we needed to gather up all of our like minded people and build our community. 

Second, to be present in our community, to serve as a rally point and let people know they are not alone. 

Just by being here today, you have accomplished those first two goals. 

We sent out our first invitation to drink coffee and make a plan only 6 weeks ago. 7 people showed up.

Since then, our community has grown with over 235 members on our Facebook page and 40 or more attending meetings every other week. 

What do we hope to accomplish?

We decided that, If they do things to harm people, we will do things to help them. 

If they make people hungry, we will feed them. 

If they make people afraid, we will stand up with them. 

Use our voices, presence and actions to build up and support our community. 

There are many organizations in the KC Metro area trying to accomplish these similar goals. We knew what we needed to do was learn to work together to accomplish our goals. To create a unity of effort. 

4. First project: Food Drive. [Notes from presenter.]

This will help us build networks and serve our community. 

Inflation was already driving utilization of this service. When we contacted several in the county, they tell us that donations are down in the post Holiday season even as need rises. They expect the need to continue to rise. 

We are going to try to assist them in backfilling this need. Our food drive will be in English Landing Park on April 19, weather permitting.  An alternate site will be established if Mother Nature decides to rain on our parade. 

We still have volunteer opportunities that Jackie Evans will talk about shortly. Some of you have already signed up. 

We expect to help the South Platte Emergency Assistance at the Presbyterian Church in downtown Parkville.

If we are successful, I expect we will be, we will organize a second drive in the summer.  

Food drives will not be the only activity. We have a calendar of volunteer opportunities, from the altruistic to the political, at our FB page. You can scan this QR code to get there. We will also regularly email people on our volunteer lists. 

At the end of the day, we plan to keep everyone organized and mobilized. With an army of volunteers, we can have a positive impact on our community and make our voices heard in the halls of government. And, just maybe we won't all go stir crazy watching our TV and doom scrolling. 

Please join us for our Food Drive on April 19.  I will be happy to answer any questions or talk to folks about it directly after the meeting. 

5. Jackie Evans, Volunteer Coordinator. Outlined needs for the Food Drive, etc. Sign-up sheet provided at end of meeting. 

6. Mat Thornton, Faith Coordinator.  Handout: One-to-one Relational Meetings. Building relationships is very important to our over all goals of building community. 


7. Tracey Steele, Communications Coordinator. On using the 5 calls app and how to talk to your representative. Access the community calendar on Google Calendar. 

8. Joe Schwartz, Project Development. Group name change and new logo. Sign up sheet for t-shirts.

9. Prescott McCray Veteran Coordinator. Provided email address and phone number to allow concerned veterans to reach out for support. 

10. Future Events:

Next meeting is March 22. It will be at the Green Hills Library, KCMO. They have coffee there!  If you come to that meeting, we ask everyone to bring at least one seasoning.  It is among the most requested, least donated items for food banks. We will start making signs, buttons and bracelets for our event. 

April 12 is the Ethnic Festival at Maple Woods Community College. Northland Pride Network will have a booth there. They need volunteers. If you can't volunteer, stop by and give them some support. 

Northland Pride Network is marching June 7.

I’m now 10 days post-op from my 3D Lapiplasty, which I had done to correct a muscle tear and bunion. I’ve struggled with constant foot pain on top of my foot (just below my first two toes), and I didn’t realize my bunion was the culprit. Since bunions run in my family, fixing it should help both the top-of-foot pain and the mild bunion discomfort I felt when walking or standing too long.

Severe Needle Anxiety & Pre-Surgery Nerves

I’ll be honest—I was more terrified of the IV than the actual surgery! I have severe needle anxiety, and the thought of getting an IV made me panic. My doctor approved a large dose of anti-anxiety meds the morning of surgery, and that helped calm me down. If you have the same fear, talk to your doctor beforehand—it made a huge difference for me.

Now that I’m 10 days in, I have to say—my foot looks beautiful! Even my other four toes look better just from the adjustment on my right big toe. I had no idea that adjusting one toe could realign all five!

Enjoying the Care, But Going Stir Crazy

I have to admit—I’m enjoying being taken care of! This is the first time I’ve ever been in a boot, and my husband have been great about helping me. But I’m starting to go stir crazy at home. If the weather is nice tomorrow, I might venture out for the first time, even if it’s just a trip to the grocery store!

My Recovery Journey

Day 1:

	•	arrived at 11 for 12 noon surgery.  They didn't rake me until 1:15.  I don't remember being rolled to OR.  I woke up at 4 pm.  I woke up  with a soft cast, given a boot to wear and The surgery center wheeled me out to the car. 
	•	My husband brought a scooter, which made getting from the car into the house much easier.
	•	Kept my foot elevated at all times, even while sleeping (kept the boot on for two nights).
	•	First night: Rough! My foot was throbbing, and I couldn’t find a comfortable sleeping position. Not as painful as a C-section, but definitely tough. I felt sorry for myself and questioning my choice to do this. 

Day 2:

	•	More of the same—slept most of the day thanks to Percocet.

Day 3:

	•	Started reducing Percocet, only taking it at night.   Body sore from sleeping.  Pain 2-3 on average.  My head ache from pain meds was worst than foot pain. 
	•	My foot wrap felt way too tight, so I called my doctor, who said I could loosen the tape.
	•	Thankfully, my nurse friend helped with that.
	•	Game changer: Someone on Reddit recommended ice pack boots from Amazon, and they worked even through my foot wrap! THIS MADE EVERYTHING BETTER IN AN INSTANT!
	•	First shower that night:  Used a waterproof foot cover and a shower chair (not the ugly white kind—found a sleek black one that I can reuse for gardening).
	•	Tips: A handheld showerhead is a must, and loofahs + liquid soap make everything easier. Someone to hold the shower head for you is even better if you don't have a hook that can keep spraying you as you soap away or shampoo.  It's cold and that shower head splashes all over the place if you don't hold it! Make sure to have your towels ready.  

Day 5:

	•	My son came home from college and helped me change the gauze and wrap.
	•	He did not touch the tape over my stitches, just the outer gauze and wrap.
	•	Seeing blood on the original bandages freaked me out, but I was prepared with extra gauze and Velcro wraps.

Day 6:

	•	Finally made it downstairs!
	•	My husband carried the scooter up and down, while I slid down the stairs on my butt and scooted up. Exhausting but effective!
	•	Food struggle: Sick of frozen meals, cereal, DoorDash pizza, and açaí bowls. On the plus side, I think I lost weight!
	•	Pain is now mostly soreness. Switched to Naproxen and Tylenol to stay ahead of it.
	•	Bathroom challenge: Couldn’t put weight on my foot, so I had to get creative. Imagine a mob boss sitting with his leg shaped like a number 4—except no cigar!

Day 8:

	•	Bruising got darker. I noticed the black and blue spreading—I’m told this is normal and happens because of blood pooling from trauma in the area. I could see it clearly from the exposed part of my foot (heel area).

Day 9:

	•	The itching started—and it drove and still continues to drive me nuts! Apparently, it’s normal, but I needed Benadryl to sleep.

Day 10 (Today!):

	•	Doctor cleared me to walk in my boot again!
	•	I hadn’t worn it since Day 3, so today was my first time using it again.
	•	No pain, just being extra cautious. Only walking on my heel and outer/bottom part of my foot for now.
	•	My doctor says it’s okay to put weight on my toes and inside of my foot, but I’ll wait one more day just to be safe!

What Helped Me the Most

✅ Mobility & Support

	1.	Knee scooter (absolute must!)
	2.	Elbow crutches (good alternative)
	3.	Walker (wish I had one for pulling myself up from the toilet)
	4.	iWalk (waste of money for me) – Might be useful if you need crutches for a long time, but not if you can bear weight in a boot.

✅ Pain & Swelling Management
5. Ankle/foot ice wrap with extra ice packs (rotate every 20 minutes)
6. Elastic bandage wraps (4-inch wide, Velcro closure)
7. Sterile gauze wrap
8. Colace or strong coffee (pain meds = constipation!)
9. Aspirin (for circulation)
10. Fiber supplements

✅ Self-Care & Clothing
11. Wide-leg sweatpants, loose t-shirts, and a hoodie (easy to wear)
12. Eye drops (all the reading, phone scrolling, and Netflix binging = dry eyes!)
13. Good moisturizer (my skin has been so dry—maybe from being sedentary?)

✅ Pillows & Comfort
14. Foot wedge pillow with raised sides (keeps foot elevated above heart)
15. Extra pillows (for extra support when propped up)
16. Husband pillow (for sitting up in bed)
17. Bed tray (for food/laptop)

✅ Bathroom & Vanity Setup
18. Clear the area where you’ll stay (make room for the scooter)
19. Only keep essentials on the vanity (toothbrush, moisturizer, paper towels)
20. Move your face wash to the shower (use it while showering)
21. Keep a hair dryer near your bed (I dried my hair in bed)
22. Snacks next to your bed (for taking meds while waiting for real food)
23.  Comfortable chair with wheels for rolling around your bed room instead of the scooter. 

What I Would Do Differently

	1.	Get a pedicure beforehand—but NO gel polish!
	•	I made the mistake of getting gel, and now I can’t get a pedicure for weeks. The gel is growing out, and I can’t remove it. 😩
	2.	Invest in a walker for the bathroom.
	•	Pulling myself up from the toilet was awkward. I had to brace myself against the vanity drawers—not ideal.
	3.	Buy a higher wedge pillow.
	•	When sitting up to watch TV in bed, I had to stack extra pillows to keep my foot properly elevated. A taller wedge would have made this easier.

Has Anyone Been Cleared to Drive with a Right Boot?

My doctor hasn’t mentioned driving yet, but I’m curious—has anyone been cleared to drive while wearing a boot on their right foot? Is that even legal? Would love to hear about your experiences!",2,1741488266.0,bunions,1,1.0,False

We wanted to get something to drink with the intention of getting drunk but amaretto is just too sweet to drink constantly. As a cocktail, it’s very tasty, but it’s impossible to do shots or anything with it. 

Any suggestions on how to drink it to level it down? The best idea we found was coffee, but it’s not sustainable because we’d need a LOT of coffee to get drunk. We don’t plan on making this mistake again, but don’t want for it to go to waste for now. ",1,1741488199.0,liquor,2,1.0,False
1j6xrtq,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1j6xrtq,Desperately seeking a 2008/2009 Milwaukee Art Museum Act/React Coffee Mug,"Hi. 

In 2009 I graduated high school as well as turned 18 that summer. When I graduated high school (MPS-Reagan, third graduating class and we were quite small) we had an amazing art teacher who gifted us all 1 year student memberships to the Milwaukee Art Museum.

A month after graduating high school I turned 18 and was able to leave home and escape childhood abuse. I had no savings and no support network. I worked 40 hours a week for a shit wage and started the EMT course at MATC. I had no recreational funds BUT I had that student membership. 

I went to the Art Museum all the time. Not just for the art, but to sit up on the third floor seating area where you can look over Lake Michigan. The Art Museum became an important part of my mental health. 

During these first months of what became a lifetime connection to the Art Museum and gazing at Lake Michigan being the first form of ""home"" I redefined for myself as I no longer ""belonged"" anywhere, was the Act/React interactive art installation. Its when they first introduced that infinity room you'd go inside of, which ended up staying for a while beyond the exhibition. I loved it. 

Before the exhibition came to an end, I wanted to get something to represent it. I wouldn't know it at the time but it would become a physical symbol of my independence and rebirth from the trauma of childhood. I was poor and knew I shouldn't...but I bought this mug. 

When you pour hot liquid into it, the black block reveals ""react."" I love it's simple black and white design. That it is interactive. Somehow it survived not one but two Milwaukee slumlords that illegally entered properties I was renting (with no failed payments) to throw remaining belongings out because they deemed me having moved out despite actually just moving one day a week over the course of my final month. It survived a spontaneous move to Madison in 2011 and a subsequent ""put everything in storage and go to California"" later that year. 

In 2016ish someone, with no ill intent, accidentally broke it. I was devastated but tried to brush it off as ""shit happens"" because I too have accidentally broken things. In an attempt to hide my pain from myself, I wrapped what remained in bubblewrap and hid it in a drawer. 

In 2021 I moved again which confronted me with it. I spent so much time trying to find a replica online with no luck. I can't even find that the mug existed. 

Recently I got a new smart ass phone that scans shit and brings up traces of stuff online. Excitedly I just thought of this concept for my mug and pieced it together -- and nothing. I still can't find a trace of it. 

I know I can kitsungi it and make it a mug again--but if I do that it won't be liquid safe. Like I couldn't (or shouldn't I suppose) pour hot water in it to see the ""React"" reveal itself. I know that building it back together probably has some deep metaphor of its ability to stay with me through the years and all the bullshit, and it's still here...just like me...but I still would love to have one I could drink from. I want to feel THAT feeling again. 

Maybe someone randomly bought it at goodwill years ago and it sits in your cabinet and isn't sentimental to you they way it would be for me? Maybe you have some secret connection to archive of Milwaukee Art Museum merch and you know someone that can retrieve one from the bowels of somewhere? I am willing to pay an absurd amount of money for one of these. 

tl;dr This mug means a lot. Internet leads nowhere. Yes I can fix but I want a liquid safe one I can drink from. Am willing to pay up for it. ",55,1741488093.0,milwaukee,20,0.95,False

The second time was a study session and we were working togeather on the same assignemt. In this she offerd to share earphones with me, we had some good banter and she got me something from the shop even though I said I was alright.

Just seeking some legal advice and guidance how to handle false allegations and slander.

Typical he said she said, through the words of a CAS worker. Before get to deep into this. Note I have researched this and have had either friend or family members experience this exact situation.  Claiming one party said slanderous nature things about the other parent. Situation here. Myself and the other parent are on great terms and she has informed her lawyer and attempted inform court through her lawyer about a few of the supposedly said allegations. Other party (her) seemed clear minded and through her lawyer made it  known to the court in no time such conversation took place about any of the allegations CAS worker claimed she made. The Start involvement date the CAS worker claims both parents began conversation with the CAS worker is literally 5 days or more before they claimed to have spoken to us. 

My belief is motion hearing the parents have little or no time to re act to the motion filed ( the day before already half way through the day). Couldn't raise any objections on the malicious slander from the CAS claiming other parent made such and such allegations. So I am more than aware CAS workers intent was to place both parents into a catergory based on factual knowledge they could discover and add these conversation that ""supposedly"" taken place where one  parent said such an such against the other * Again both parties attempted to make it known that not only were such allegations ever said.. The talks themselves with the CAS worker never taken place period*

I never have met the worker period and had requested prior to the motion to meet at a local coffee shop to speak over any potential issue concern and what they would like me to do and what they feel needs addressed.  I was simply ignored mind you the week prior that Friday they had requested to meet. I went to schedule and got ignored. Leading into the week of motion and what their claims were.

So my question is. Based on both parties lawyers attempted to question the allegations they both were informed to wait until next court. Therefore judge granting the motion based off false allegations an slander. What steps as one of the parents can be taken ( both are seeking further legal advice as only had half a day we had to use duty council that morning). What steps can we take to inform the court. And this CAS workers management of such situation. Any advice would be more than appreciated and will not fall on deaf ears.

I'm so sorry. No, it's OK. It's fine. I know I'm dreaming. But I don't recall going to bed. Well, I'm sure this is very disconcerting. This is a bit of a surprise to me. I mean, you're a bee! I am. And I'm not supposed to be doing this, but they were all trying to kill me. And if it wasn't for you... I had to thank you. It's just how I was raised. That was a little weird. - I'm talking with a bee. - Yeah. I'm talking to a bee. And the bee is talking to me! I just want to say I'm grateful. I'll leave now. - Wait! How did you learn to do that? - What? The talking thing. Same way you did, I guess. ""Mama, Dada, honey."" You pick it up. - That's very funny. - Yeah. Bees are funny. If we didn't laugh, we'd cry with what we have to deal with. Anyway... Oan I... ...get you something? - Like what? I don't know. I mean... I don't know. Ooffee? I don't want to put you out. It's no trouble. It takes two minutes. - It's just coffee. - I hate to impose. - Don't be ridiculous! - Actually, I would love a cup. Hey, you want rum cake? - I shouldn't. - Have some. - No, I can't. - Oome on! I'm trying to lose a couple micrograms. - Where? - These stripes don't help. You look great! I don't know if you know anything about fashion. Are you all right? No. He's making the tie in the cab as they're flying up Madison. He finally gets there. He runs up the steps into the church. The wedding is on. And he says, ""Watermelon? I thought you said Guatemalan. Why would I marry a watermelon?"" Is that a bee joke? That's the kind of stuff we do. Yeah, different. So, what are you gonna do, Barry? About work? I don't know. I want to do my part for the hive, but I can't do it the way they want. I know how you feel. - You do? - Sure. My parents wanted me to be a lawyer or a doctor, but I wanted to be a florist. - Really? - My only interest is flowers. Our new queen was just elected with that same campaign slogan. Anyway, if you look... There's my hive right there. See it? You're in Sheep Meadow! Yes! I'm right off the Turtle Pond! No way! I know that area. I lost a toe ring there once. - Why do girls put rings on their toes? - Why not? - It's like putting a hat on your knee. - Maybe I'll try that. - You all right, ma'am? - Oh, yeah. Fine. Just having two cups of coffee! Anyway, this has been great. Thanks for the coffee. Yeah, it's no trouble. Sorry I couldn't finish it. If I did, I'd be up the rest of my life. Are you...? Oan I take a piece of this with me? Sure! Here, have a crumb. - Thanks! - Yeah. All right. Well, then... I guess I'll see you around. Or not. OK, Barry. And thank you so much again... for before. Oh, that? That was nothing. Well, not nothing, but... Anyway... This can't possibly work. He's all set to go. We may as well try it. OK, Dave, pull the chute. - Sounds amazing. - It was amazing! It was the scariest, happiest moment of my life. Humans! I can't believe you were with humans! Giant, scary humans! What were they like? Huge and crazy. They talk crazy. They eat crazy giant things. They drive crazy. - Do they try and kill you, like on TV? - Some of them. But some of them don't. - How'd you get back? - Poodle. You did it, and I'm glad. You saw whatever you wanted to see. You had your ""experience."" Now you can pick out yourjob and be normal. - Well... - Well? Well, I met someone. You did? Was she Bee-ish? - A wasp?! Your parents will kill you! - No, no, no, not a wasp. - Spider? - I'm not attracted to spiders. I know it's the hottest thing, with the eight legs and all. I can't get by that face. So who is she? She's... human. No, no. That's a bee law. You wouldn't break a bee law. - Her name's Vanessa. - Oh, boy. She's so nice. And she's a florist! Oh, no! You're dating a human florist! We're not dating. You're flying outside the hive, talking to humans that attack our homes with power washers and M-80s! One-eighth a stick of dynamite! She saved my life! And she understands me. This is over! Eat this. This is not over! What was that? - They call it a crumb. - It was so stingin' stripey! And that's not what they eat. That's what falls off what they eat! - You know what a Oinnabon is? - No. It's bread and cinnamon and frosting. They heat it up... Sit down! ...really hot! - Listen to me! We are not them! We're us. There's us and there's them! Yes, but who can deny the heart that is yearning? There's no yearning. Stop yearning. Listen to me! You have got to start thinking bee, my friend. Thinking bee! - Thinking bee. - Thinking bee. Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! Thinking bee! There he is. He's in the pool. You know what your problem is, Barry? I gotta start thinking bee? How much longer will this go on? It's been three days! Why aren't you working? I've got a lot of big life decisions to think about. What life? You have no life! You have no job. You're barely a bee! Would it kill you to make a little honey? Barry, come out. Your father's talking to you. Martin, would you talk to him? Barry, I'm talking to you! You coming? Got everything? All set! Go ahead. I'll catch up. Don't be too long. Watch this! Vanessa! - We're still here. - I told you not to yell at him. He doesn't respond to yelling! - Then why yell at me? - Because you don't listen! I'm not listening to this. Sorry, I've gotta go. - Where are you going? - I'm meeting a friend. A girl? Is this why you can't decide? Bye. I just hope she's Bee-ish. They have a huge parade of flowers every year in Pasadena? To be in the Tournament of Roses, that's every florist's dream! Up on a float, surrounded by flowers, crowds cheering. A tournament. Do the roses compete in athletic events? No. All right, I've got one. How come you don't fly everywhere? It's exhausting. Why don't you run everywhere? It's faster. Yeah, OK, I see, I see. All right, your turn. TiVo. You can just freeze live TV? That's insane! You don't have that? We have Hivo, but it's a disease. It's a horrible, horrible disease. Oh, my. Dumb bees! You must want to sting all those jerks. We try not to sting. It's usually fatal for us. So you have to watch your temper. Very carefully. You kick a wall, take a walk, write an angry letter and throw it out. Work through it like any emotion: Anger, jealousy, lust. Oh, my goodness! Are you OK? Yeah. - What is wrong with you?! - It's a bug. He's not bothering anybody. Get out of here, you creep! What was that? A Pic 'N' Save circular? Yeah, it was. How did you know? It felt like about 10 pages. Seventy-five is pretty much our limit. You've really got that down to a science. - I lost a cousin to Italian Vogue. - I'll bet. What in the name of Mighty Hercules is this? How did this get here? Oute Bee, Golden Blossom, Ray Liotta Private Select? - Is he that actor? - I never heard of him. - Why is this here? - For people. We eat it. You don't have enough food of your own? - Well, yes. - How do you get it? - Bees make it. - I know who makes it! And it's hard to make it! There's heating, cooling, stirring. You need a whole Krelman thing! - It's organic. - It's our-ganic! It's just honey, Barry. Just what?! Bees don't know about this! This is stealing! A lot of stealing! You've taken our homes, schools, hospitals! This is all we have! And it's on sale?! I'm getting to the bottom of this. I'm getting to the bottom of all of this! Hey, Hector. - You almost done? - Almost. He is here. I sense it. Well, I guess I'll go home now and just leave this nice honey out, with no one around. You're busted, box boy! I knew I heard something. So you can talk! I can talk. And now you'll start talking! Where you getting the sweet stuff? Who's your supplier? I don't understand. I thought we were friends. The last thing we want to do is upset bees! You're too late! It's ours now! You, sir, have crossed the wrong sword! You, sir, will be lunch for my iguana, Ignacio! Where is the honey coming from? Tell me where! Honey Farms! It comes from Honey Farms! Orazy person! What horrible thing has happened here? These faces, they never knew what hit them. And now they're on the road to nowhere! Just keep still. What? You're not dead? Do I look dead? They will wipe anything that moves. Where you headed? To Honey Farms. I am onto something huge here. I'm going to Alaska. Moose blood, crazy stuff. Blows your head off! I'm going to Tacoma. - And you? - He really is dead. All right. Uh-oh! - What is that?! - Oh, no! - A wiper! Triple blade! - Triple blade? Jump on! It's your only chance, bee! Why does everything have to be so doggone clean?! How much do you people need to see?! Open your eyes! Stick your head out the window! From NPR News in Washington, I'm Oarl Kasell. But don't kill no more bugs! - Bee! - Moose blood guy!! - You hear something? - Like what? Like tiny screaming. Turn off the radio. Whassup, bee boy? Hey, Blood. Just a row of honey jars, as far as the eye could see. Wow! I assume wherever this truck goes is where they're getting it. I mean, that honey's ours. - Bees hang tight. - We're all jammed in. It's a close community. Not us, man. We on our own. Every mosquito on his own. - What if you get in trouble? - You a mosquito, you in trouble. Nobody likes us. They just smack. See a mosquito, smack, smack! At least you're out in the world. You must meet girls. Mosquito girls try to trade up, get with a moth, dragonfly. Mosquito girl don't want no mosquito. You got to be kidding me! Mooseblood's about to leave the building! So long, bee! - Hey, guys! - Mooseblood! I knew I'd catch y'all down here. Did you bring your crazy straw? We throw it in jars, slap a label on it, and it's pretty much pure profit. What is this place? A bee's got a brain the size of a pinhead. They are pinheads! Pinhead. - Oheck out the new smoker. - Oh, sweet. That's the one you want. The Thomas 3000! Smoker? Ninety puffs a minute, semi-automatic. Twice the nicotine, all the tar. A couple breaths of this knocks them right out. They make the honey, and we make the money. ""They make the honey, and we make the money""? Oh, my! What's going on? Are you OK? Yeah. It doesn't last too long. Do you know you're in a fake hive with fake walls? Our queen was moved here. We had no choice. This is your queen? That's a man in women's clothes! That's a drag queen! What is this? Oh, no! There's hundreds of them! Bee honey. Our honey is being brazenly stolen on a massive scale! This is worse than anything bears have done! I intend to do something. Oh, Barry, stop. Who told you humans are taking our honey? That's a rumor. Do these look like rumors? That's a conspiracy theory. These are obviously doctored photos. How did you get mixed up in this? He's been talking to humans. - What? - Talking to humans?! He has a human girlfriend. And they make out! Make out? Barry! We do not. - You wish you could. - Whose side are you on? The bees! I dated a cricket once in San Antonio. Those crazy legs kept me up all night. Barry, this is what you want to do with your life? I want to do it for all our lives.

Transforming your apartment balcony into a cozy retreat is easily achievable with the right patio furniture set. The selection you make can enhance your outdoor experience, allowing you to enjoy fresh air, sun, and an inviting ambiance. When choosing a patio furniture set for limited balcony space, consider compact designs that maximize comfort without overwhelming the area.

Look for sets that include a small table and chairs that are easy to move. Foldable furniture is a fantastic option for apartment balconies, as it can be stored away when not in use, creating more space for relaxation or entertaining. Materials that withstand the elements, such as aluminum, teak, or weather-resistant resin, are ideal to ensure durability and minimal maintenance.

Another key factor is the aesthetic appeal of your patio furniture set. Opt for colors and styles that complement your apartment's decor or the lush surroundings. A set with vibrant cushions can add a splash of color to the balcony, transforming it into a welcoming oasis. Consider adding outdoor throw pillows for additional comfort and style.

In terms of functionality, many modern patio furniture sets come with integrated features such as built-in storage solutions or extendable tables. These conveniences cater specifically to apartment living, making the best use of your available space. For instance, look for coffee tables that double as storage or modular seating that allows flexible arrangements based on your needs.

Finally, don’t forget to accessorize. Adding a few plants, decorative lights, and a stylish outdoor rug can elevate the atmosphere of your apartment balcony. A well-thought-out patio furniture set not only enhances the space but also creates an inviting environment for relaxation, making your balcony the perfect spot to unwind after a long day.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1j6xivp,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1j6xivp/the_boca_raton_beach_club/,The Boca Raton - Beach Club,"**Where we went**: The Boca Raton - Beach Club

**When we went**: Feb 25 - March 1

**Who went**: Me, husband, 2.5 yr old.

**Service**: 9

* Pool/beach service was very good. They came around all the time and there were flags on the chairs you flipped up if you wanted something so it was not obtrusive
* I asked for ice to be brought to the room before dinner one night and it was totally missed, when I called again after dinner they apologized and it was brought up
* Water taxi captains were great, one gave my daughter temporary tattoos which she loved

**Property**: 8

* The Beach Club property itself is really beautiful and brand new. There are amazing views and the communal areas are furnished/decorated beautifully. I failed at taking useful pics but the website's photos are very accurate. I will say in the morning when the sun is coming up the restaurants really get blasted by the sun and there don't seem to be any umbrellas or awnings at the moment.
* The layout of the building was kind of confusing. The elevators are off to the side in the building. The ""main floor"" with the lobby and check in is on the 3rd floor and then the ground floor is where you access the pool/beach/restaurants. However in order to access the water taxi to get to the main property you have to go to the 3rd floor, walk outside to a different elevator bank, and take another elevator down to walk across the street to the water taxi. Once you got the lay of the land it was fine but initially it was confusing and I saw other guests also get lost/confused. 
* At the Beach Club property there was minor maintenance going on at all times - painting touch ups in common areas, on planters, working on the elevators, working on the room doorbells
* There are three pools at just the Beach Club, one was adults only, one was kids, and there was a zero entry pool off to the side that I didn't see anyone use while we were there
* There are two entrances to the beach, one is apparently for club members and one is for hotel guests. Same with the seating, there is a section for club members, section for hotel guests, and a section for suite guests. None of this was totally clear, I had gone to the beach via the member entrance one day and then they sat me in the hotel guest section. We were staying in a suite but I only realized there was a suite section when I was talking to another guest. I get the member and hotel guest distinction but the suite section seemed redundant. Either way there was never an issue getting a seat at the beach
* The Beach Club was semi family friendly. We did spend most of our time at the Harborside/main property which is extremely family friendly. 
* We checked out on a Saturday afternoon and tons of people were arriving, it seemed to be getting very scene-y.
* We were able to get a late checkout on a busy Saturday, many thanks to Alex!

**Rooms**: 8

* We stayed in a lakeview 1 bdrm suite. It was room 704. I think other ""lakeview"" rooms along the back of the hotel would have better views but for this specific room, lakeview is a stretch. We mainly looked out over a parking lot and loading dock. The loading dock part would probably bother some people because the trucks were beeping/slamming late at night and in the morning. 
* Room itself was great, well appointed and laid out nicely. There was a walk-in closet and full dresser. They had a crib in the bedroom for our daughter. I will note that it was not a full size crib, she was definitely too big but she was so tired most nights there were no complaints. They also gave us a bib for her and a blanket for the crib. There was diaper cream/baby soap/baby lotion and a rubber ducky in the bathroom. They also had a beach toy bag in the room which was a nice touch.
* Lots of room in the living room, plenty of storage there too in the media center. There was a second full bathroom in the living room which was great for after our daughter went to bed or during naps.
* Mini bar with soda, beer, wine, and a bunch of snacks was available for free. My daughter basically only ate the cheddar whales from the mini bar the entire time we were there and they restocked them often.
* The bar area also dispensed filtered water. They gave you stainless steel water bottles to use/refill throughout the resort.
* You can definitely hear other room doors shutting from inside the room. Didn't bother us but it was noticeable.
* Loved the motorized blackout blinds.

**Food**: 

* Thanks to traveling with a 2 year old our food was pretty lame this week. We didn't get to try most of the restaurants
* Harbor House - at the Harborside property, don't need reservations, very family friendly, dinner and apps were good, desserts were not good, our drinks were missed one night but overall a nice, relaxed spot
* Marisol - at the Beach Club, Dinner was VERY good! A few menu options have tableside presentations which was cool. They seated people with kids off to one side which I appreciated. We also had breakfast here one day, we sat outside but as I mentioned earlier we were getting baked by the sun and there didn't seem to be any remedy. The food was good but my daughter got antsy so we got out of there fast
* The Library - during the day this was a cafe on the lobby level at the Beach Club. After I realized this was an option we ate breakfast here the rest of the trip. Great pastries, coffee options and hot breakfast options. The three of us ate plenty and easily stayed under the $120/day breakfast credit. Again the entire outdoor seating area was in the direct sun so we sat inside. There were other families here every morning. In the evening this area became a bar, very cool atmosphere and a great view of the ocean.
* Being in a suite also gave us access to Top of the Tower on the Harborside. My husband thought it was great, I thought it was ok. There was a bar and some hot food set out (not a full meal). They had a gelato machine, and some snacks and candy to grab. There was also a kids section up there that was nice. We were the only people there each time we went.

**Extras & activities**: 9

* This entire resort is amazing for families. We spent most of the days at the main resort in the lazy river. We would get seats each morning by the zero entry part of the pool and hang out there until the early afternoon. 
* My only real issue with the trip was that the splash pad/pirate ship area was closed for two full days. This was a huge bummer since our daughter really loved it the first day and they kept saying it would reopen but it did not. Through Alex we were offered a cabana for a day but our kid liked playing in the zero entry part of the pool and the cabanas were in a different pool area so there wasn't really a benefit for us. I did have to lol because one of the cabana options were ""kids cabanas"" which were in the non working splash pad area. Would have been so sad to make a kid hang out in there when the splash pad was closed! 
* The kids club is by the Harborside pool, we didn't use it since kids need to be 4 but they had an area that was available to anyone for coloring and had some kids books and toys. We did visit that a few times when she needed a break from the pool.
* If you stay at The Beach Club you are able to get a free ride on their boat called the ""Sorbetto,"" it's a cute little Fiat boat that gets a lot of attention in the lake! The captain was very nice and accommodating and it was a fun way to cap off the trip! 
* They have a simulated surfing machine called ""Flow Rider,"" that my husband was embarrassingly obsessed with. I think it would be great for older kids. They also have an indoor teen hangout area called the Break in this area. 
* There also is tons of tennis, pickleball and golf options but we didn't explore that this trip. Didn't get to the spa either

Overall we will def be back, it is a direct flight for us and perfect for this phase of life(we also have a 6 month old that we did not bring this time). We could easily bring grandparents with us which we will do next time. 

We used to be adventure travelers and my past self would not believe that I spent 5 days at a luxury resort in Florida. Looking forward to more interesting travels in the future but our daughter had so much fun and we were able to relax and get out of the snow. 

We booked this on a weeks notice so only the Beach Club was available, it was beautiful but I definitely want to stay Harborside next time. I am also curious about other peoples experiences with the Tower, Cloisters and Bungalows. ",1,1741487283.0,chubbytravel,0,1.0,False

### **The Winter War**      
     
### **Chapter 2: The Suiza Proposal**  

The **intelligentsia council chamber** was carved deep into the limestone heart of Casa Montalvo, a relic of the old world made indispensable in the new. Once a fortress against colonial empires, now a nerve center for Puerto Rico’s expansionist ambitions, it was where Sebastián Montalvo y Estrella made decisions that would ripple across the **Martian Freehold, the orbital stations, and the silent reaches beyond**.  

The council had gathered—**senators, lords, financiers, military minds**, all seated in a long crescent beneath the arched ceiling. The room smelled of **brewed coffee and old paper**, a contrast to the sleek **holographic displays** flickering with industry reports and orbital projections.  

At the center of it all stood **the Suiza capitalist**.  

He was a man of **measured elegance**, his suit pressed with **the sharpness of a man who never let disorder touch him**. His hair was neatly combed, his eyes a shade of **ice-blue precision**. He carried himself **not as a guest, but as an architect**—as if he had already drawn the blueprints for Puerto Rico’s future, and was simply waiting for them to follow his design.  

“My name is **Isaak Brandt**,” he said, his voice smooth, deliberate. “And I come with solutions.”  

Sebastián watched him from the high seat at the table’s center, fingers steepled. He had seen **many men like Brandt**—confident, well-rehearsed, eager to present themselves as the missing piece in a grander puzzle.  

Sebastián never trusted a man who spoke in certainties.  

“Your reputation precedes you, Mr. Brandt,” Sebastián said coolly. “South African investment circles still whisper your name. Some with admiration. Others… with wariness.”  

Brandt allowed a smile, barely perceptible. “I prefer to be judged by results, Your Highness.”  

“And what results do you offer us?”  

Brandt turned slightly, gesturing toward the **holo-display** at the chamber’s center. The orbital schematics shifted, displaying projections of **Puerto Rico’s current Martian operations**—extraction sites, supply routes, refinery installations. **Then, overlaid against them, a series of red-marked inefficiencies**.  

“You are expanding,” Brandt said. “Ambitiously. Boldly. But also—recklessly.”  

Murmurs rippled through the council. Sebastián did not move. He simply watched.  

Brandt continued. “Your titanium extraction is at **64% operational efficiency**. Your off-world refineries? **Understaffed and overstrained**. Supply chains? **Vulnerable to disruption**. You are positioning yourself as a competitor in the interplanetary economy—**but your infrastructure is still colonial**.”  

The silence in the room **stretched**.  

It was **a calculated insult**, but Brandt had delivered it like a **physician diagnosing an illness**—cold, professional, necessary.  

“Your proposal?” Sebastián asked, his voice even.  

Brandt pressed a command into his **slate**, and the display shifted again—new projections, new calculations. **Efficiency gains, cost reductions, streamlined logistics**.  

“I have designed economic restructuring initiatives for **three nations**, overseen industrial expansions across **two continents**, and advised corporate coalitions whose revenue exceeds that of most sovereign governments,” Brandt said. “I can do the same for you.”  

Sebastián studied the numbers. They were **elegant**, persuasive.  

Too persuasive.  

“And in return?”  

Brandt smiled, **this time without restraint**.  

“A partnership.”  

Sebastián already knew **this was no mere partnership**. It was an **exchange of control, a quiet subjugation beneath the guise of assistance**.  

But Puerto Rico was in **a delicate position**. The budget **was bleeding**, the competition **was closing in**, and even his own council was **leaning forward**, their skepticism **slowly eroding beneath the weight of Brandt’s proposal**.  

He did not trust Isaak Brandt.  

But he would let him in.  

For now.

u/StackingSovereign (r/gold)

Goldbacks are a complete joke. Why the hell would I pay 300%+ premium for a fraction of a gram of gold laminated into a piece of plastic? You Goldback cultists are getting scammed. Just stack real gold like an adult.

u/LibertyGold (r/goldbacks)

Lmao, here come the bullion bros who can’t comprehend that not everyone is stacking just to hoard. Try actually spending your 1oz gold bars at a gas station and let me know how that works out. Goldbacks are usable gold. You guys just don’t get it.

u/BullionMaxxed (r/gold)

Usable gold? Lmao. Let me get this straight—you’re out here paying 5x spot price because you think your local coffee shop is going to start accepting Goldbacks in the apocalypse? Jesus, do you also think silver dimes are legal tender?

u/GoldbackEvangelist (r/goldbacks)

Oh wow, another smooth-brained bullion hoarder who thinks the only purpose of gold is to bury it in his backyard and pray to the Austrian economists. Not everything has to be purely an investment. Some of us actually spend gold instead of just jerking off to our stacks.

u/StackingSovereign

Yeah, keep telling yourself that while you pay $10 for a fraction of a dollar’s worth of gold. I’ll be over here buying actual ounces of metal while you’re pissing away money on overhyped monopoly money.

u/FreedomTender (r/goldbacks)

Oh look, another “muh spot price” maximalist who doesn’t understand that small denominations cost more because of production. Newsflash: fractional gold coins also have high premiums. But I guess you wouldn’t know that since you only hoard big bars like a clueless goblin.

u/RealMoneyEnjoyer (r/gold)

Buddy, I own fractional gold coins, and they still have actual gold value when I go to sell them. Meanwhile, your Goldbacks are worth jack sh*t outside of your libertarian farmer’s market. The moment you try to cash them in, you’re getting pennies back.

u/GoldbackEvangelist

Oh my god, you people are exhausting. It’s like trying to explain Bitcoin to a boomer. Goldbacks aren’t meant to be resold at spot price—they’re for spending. Not everything has to fit into your “number go up” boomer logic.

u/StackingSovereign

Lol, okay, sure, Goldbacks are ""spendable""—in like three states, if you’re lucky. Outside of that, they’re just fancy collectibles with a dumbass cult following.

u/LibertyGold

Ah yes, because gold and silver were totally universal the moment they were introduced thousands of years ago. You realize adoption takes time, right? Or is your brain too focused on stacking like some dragon from Lord of the Rings?

u/BullionMaxxed

Lmfao, yeah, tell me more about how Goldbacks are gonna become mainstream while 99.9% of the world doesn’t even know what the hell they are. This isn’t Bitcoin, dude, it’s gold-infused Monopoly money that no one actually wants.

u/GoldbackEvangelist

Cool, keep stacking your illiquid bars and let me know how well that works when you actually need to trade for food. “BuT SiLvEr ExIsTs”—yeah, enjoy carrying a brick of silver around when I can literally fit my gold money in a wallet.

u/StackingSovereign

Enjoy paying 5x spot for your ""gold money"" lmfao. Some of us actually care about not getting fleeced when we buy metals.

u/FreedomTender

Some of us actually care about being able to use our metals, not just sitting around polishing them like a nerd. Enjoy your overpriced collectible coins while pretending they’re somehow more “real” than a form of actual gold currency.

u/RealMoneyEnjoyer

Gold currency? Bruh, they’re not currency, they’re just expensive tokens that you decided have value. Meanwhile, my gold bars are recognized worldwide. Try taking a Goldback to a coin shop outside of Utah and see what they give you.

u/GoldbackEvangelist

Yeah, and try spending your brick of gold at a restaurant. Oh wait, you can’t. But I can walk into dozens of businesses and use Goldbacks. Keep thinking that gold is only for hoarding like a clueless prepper.

u/BullionMaxxed

“Dozens of businesses” lmfao, congratulations, you found 50 stores in the entire US that will take your overpriced laminated gold stickers. Enjoy your cope while I keep stacking real wealth.

u/LibertyGold

Y’all are so stuck in your ways, it’s hilarious. You act like the dollar isn’t already backed by nothing, but god forbid someone tries to create a spendable form of gold. Just keep stacking and praying the system collapses, I guess.

u/StackingSovereign

Oh trust me, when the system collapses, I’ll be a lot better off holding actual gold than holding your hyper-premium memes that nobody wants.

u/FreedomTender

You’ll also be a lot better off when you need small transactions and realize your brick of gold isn’t helping you buy bread.

u/StackingSovereign

Bro, silver exists. I’m not using stupid-ass Goldbacks when junk silver is literally the same concept, but without the cult-like premium.

u/GoldbackEvangelist

Silver is bulky as hell, dumbass. Try carrying $1,000 worth of silver around and tell me that’s practical. Meanwhile, I can fit a month’s worth of spending money in Goldbacks inside my wallet.

u/BullionMaxxed

Oh yeah, can’t wait to pay 3x spot for the privilege of carrying my wealth in a fragile piece of plastic that only 12 businesses will take. Sounds like a great deal.

u/FreedomTender

You know what? Fine. Keep stacking your useless bricks of metal, and I’ll keep using my spendable gold. We’ll see who’s laughing when you’re trying to barter your gold eagles for a loaf of bread and I’m just handing over Goldbacks.

u/StackingSovereign

Yeah, I’ll be laughing too—because I’ll just be using silver like a normal person instead of falling for a gimmicky gold-infused coupon.

1j6xcf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1j6xcf4/am_i_being_creepy_or_endearing/,Am I being creepy or endearing?,"   I (26M) got out of a 3 year relationship 6 months ago and am finally trying to put myself back out there. However, I am having issues meeting new people because my friend group is pretty self contained, I am out of school, and I also work remotely. 

   So I am trying to think of ways to put myself out there. One way I thought of was doing remote work from communal areas like coffee shops or even the cafe at my local botanic garden. 

   Then I thought that maybe I could be more proactive about my dating situation. If I ever saw a girl that I thought was cute at one of these places, I would write her a note about how certain species of penguins will go to the beach to find pretty rocks for the penguin that they like (saw it in a nature documentary). I would also mention a request to buy the girl a coffee to get to know her either today or some other day. On the back of the note would be my name and phone number. I would then walk up to the girl I liked and hand her this note along with a cool rock from my rock collection. I wouldn’t say much, just smile and give her the note, and then return to my work. 

Is this creepy of me?

   I suck at flirting and hitting on girls seems alien to me after dating someone previously for years. I have terrible skills at being suave. But I know that I need to be proactive about meeting my next partner, she isn’t just magically going to appear in my life. So, I figured this current note strategy would be good because it is not very confrontational, yet still relies on me making the first move, and the girl gets a cool rock even if she isn’t interested. I am hoping that the fact that the girl gets a rock will make her less likely to be mean or rude to me. I am fine with rejection of course, I just fear being seen as creepy or having the girl respond to me by saying mean things. 

   I have heard all the common advice on meeting new people like joining clubs or sports. I am part of several clubs/ groups but these groups usually attract older people outside of my age bracket (I am into geology, botany and mushroom foraging). I have been part of many of these groups for years, and have consistently been one of the only young adults in the mix. 

   To summarize, I need help. Based on my situation, my only real hope at meeting a new girl is by initiating talks with strangers, or resorting to dating apps which I have never done.

We currently have a Delonghi Dedica Arte Manual Coffee Machine (the old model before the updated steam wand) and use a manual hand Kin Grinder. We don’t get consistent shots doing this method and it’s a very slow process. My partner is a tradie and doesn’t give himself enough time to do the whole process every morning before work.

I’ve been researching and tossing up between the Breville Barista express and the kitchen aid semi automatic with burr grinder.

(I also like that the kitchen aid is quieter). If anyone else has any ideas on maybe a third better option I’d appreciate any advice.

1j6xalm,https://www.reddit.com/r/sourdoughmicrobakery/comments/1j6xalm/how_to_start_a_sourdough_micro_bakery_from_home/,How to Start a Sourdough Micro Bakery from Home (Step-by-Step Guide),"Thinking about starting a sourdough micro bakery from home? You’re not alone! Many passionate bakers are turning their love for artisan bread into a small business, whether by selling at farmers' markets, through home delivery, or on a subscription model. But where do you start?

This guide covers the essentials of launching a micro bakery, from legal requirements to pricing and marketing.

1. Perfect Your Sourdough Baking Skills

Before selling sourdough, you need to ensure consistency, quality, and efficiency in your process. A successful micro bakery relies on loaves that customers can count on—same crust, same crumb, every time.

Key Tips:
✅ Develop a streamlined baking schedule that fits your lifestyle.
✅ Experiment with bulk fermentation and cold-proofing to manage your time efficiently.
✅ Consider diversifying your product line with focaccia, bagels, or enriched sourdough breads.

2. Understand Cottage Food Laws & Licensing

Selling food from home comes with legal requirements that vary by state, province, or country. Most places have cottage food laws that regulate what you can sell, where you can sell it, and whether you need inspections.

How to Check Your Local Laws:

Search ""[your state/province] cottage food laws"" or ""[your city] home bakery license.""
Contact your local health department for up-to-date regulations.
Some areas require labeling, while others allow only direct-to-customer sales.
3. Set Up Your Micro Bakery Business

Once you have the legal side sorted, it's time to structure your business.

✔️ Choose a Name & Branding: A memorable name, a simple logo, and even an Instagram page can go a long way.
✔️ Decide on Your Selling Model: Farmers' markets? Home pickups? Delivery? Subscription-based bread boxes?
✔️ Determine Pricing: Factor in ingredient costs, time, utilities, and packaging. Aim for a price that reflects the value of handmade artisan bread while staying competitive.

4. Find Customers & Market Your Bread

Even if you bake the best bread in town, customers won’t magically appear. You need to put your micro bakery in front of the right people.

🚀 Best Ways to Market Your Sourdough Bakery:
🔹 Word-of-mouth: Friends and family are often your first customers—let them spread the word!
🔹 Instagram & Facebook: Share photos, behind-the-scenes baking shots, and customer testimonials.
🔹 Local Community Groups: Join neighborhood Facebook groups or post on Nextdoor to attract local buyers.
🔹 Collaborate: Partner with local coffee shops, markets, or grocery stores to supply fresh sourdough.
🔹 Offer Sampling: Nothing convinces a customer like a taste of fresh, crusty sourdough!

5. Manage Orders & Scale Your Business

Once orders start rolling in, organization is key.

✔️ Use Google Forms, a simple website, or Instagram DMs to take orders.
✔️ Plan your baking days and delivery schedule to balance efficiency and freshness.
✔️ Consider expanding with new products, seasonal specials, or subscription models.

1j6xa37,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1j6xa37/want_to_talk_to_someone_who_broke_up_with_someone/,Want to talk to someone who broke up with someone somewhat recently.,"My situation is the following. Some months ago I was in a dating app and came across a girl's profile. This girl was one of the most striking profiles I've ever seen. Funny, same goals in a relationships, much of our likes (history, art history, among others) were intertwined, etc. This, coupled with the fact that she was beautiful (not model level, but someone who you would probably say is pretty if you saw her on the street) made me super interested in her, not only on a physical level but much much more on an intellectual level.

I kinda ignore the profile and go about my business, and some months after I go out with a friend of mine and he asks me what I've been up to romantically. I told him not much and start raving about this girl that I saw on a dating app. Some solid raving (about 5 or maybe close to 10 min). My friend then asks me her name and I tell him (her profile was so striking that much of the details stook out in my mind months after)  and he makes fun that maybe it's a girl she works with. We start laughing about but then he shows me her Instagram profile and it was the girl. I was absolutely shocked.

He asks me if he wants him to talk about me to the girl, to which I make myself kinda ""shy"" but at the same time saying ""please do"". He tells me that it would probably end badly because he though the girl was in a relationship already. Turns out, the girl broke up with her boyfriend earlier the week when my friend and I went to have a coffee. Nevertheless, he talks about me to her, and tells her this story to which she found amusing (given the information that my friend provided). 

She's says that I can follow her on instagram and DM and I do but she does not reply back. I give her time because I don't want to rush or pressure her. A week goes by and my friend asks her about if she messaged me already and she tells him that she's not in a good place mentally yet to go into another relationship. Another week goes by and I go to their workplace (they work at a museum and went more to have lunch with my friend and chat with him then to talk to her). 

Nevertheless, he warns her that I'm coming to the museum so that she doesnt find it weird and she tells him that I could talk to her with no problem. I go to the museum, have a lunch with my friend and go visit the museum and I come to the section that she was around. I chat with her for around 5 mins.

Not an amazing talk. I ask her what paintings she would recommend me seeing, her favourite art movements, we talk about our hate about picasso, and make a joke about an ice-cream that I was planning to give her (she was aware of this. She texted me previously to warn me that she appreciated the gesture and the care but that there was no need) and go about my business. 

I really want to talk with her but now my friend and her probably won't see each other again because their contract are up. He told me to text her around Monday or Tuesday and chat her up about some our similar likes, for example Bob Dylan etc etc.

This is all find and dandy but she has insisted twice that she is not ready for anything right now. I told my friend that I can wait just because I'm so interested in her, but at the same time I don't want to pressure her into talking to me when she already said that she does not want anything. At the same time, I think we are kinda the same from what my friend gathered (hopeless romantic) and she got really bad because her boyfriend wanted something casual when she want something long-term (the relationship was not long).

Simple enough.. I thought given that Duo had focused on this construction: condizionale imperfetto or indicativo imperfetto+che + congiuntivo imperfetto sentence construction in the current lesson.

'Pensavo che mi offrissi un caffè.'   was my answer.

Duo was looking for this answer.

'Credevo tu mi offrissi un caffè'  which gave rise to 2 questions.

Questions.

1. Pensare vs Credere? -  I thought P vs C = Thought vs Believe?  Are they interchangeable in this instance?  Or is one better than the other?
2. Che -  to use or not to use?  Is there a difference in meaning between the two sentences?    Which is better or not and if so why?

Am I missing something there?

Thanks in advance. ",1,1741486321.0,italianlearning,10,1.0,False
