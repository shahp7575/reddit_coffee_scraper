1ixhzrb,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1ixhzrb/my_dad_died_and_i_found_out_on_my_birthday/,"My dad died, and I found out on my birthday.","My dad turned 55 years old on Wednesday, February 19th. His birthday, my birthday (the 22nd), and my sister's birthday (the 24th) are close together, and until he passed, I never understood how much that would mean to me.

I texted my dad Wednesday evening (the 19th), to wish him a happy birthday and let him know I was having surgery the next day (the 20th). He texted me back to say ""thank you, I love you, and I'll be praying for you"".

I had surgery the following day, and texted him to let him know I made it out of surgery ok. I never heard back from him.

Saturday, the 22nd was my 32nd birthday. I was recovering from the surgery and laying in my bed most of the day. Dad always calls on my birthday, and even though we haven't really been speaking the last several months, I knew he would still call or at least text. By 5:30pm, I still hadn't heard from him.

At 5:55pm on Saturday, my sister sent me a strange text with a screenshot from someone from our hometown trying to get a hold of us. I thought it was strange, so I called the number.

It was my dad's neighbor. He asked me if I was at home, and sitting down. His exact words were, ""I don't know how to tell you this, but we found your dad passed away in his recliner today.""

All of the oxygen was sucked out my lungs in that moment. I had to call my sister, and give her the news immediately after. I lost all of the feeling in my hands, and I couldn't hold myself up. I've never experienced anything like it.

We found out my dad probably passed away sometime Thursday evening. His buddies from work were worried about him as he seemed sick at work on Thursday, and when he didn't show up, they were afraid something happened, so they broke into his house to find him passed away on Saturday.

He lived alone, and has since my parents divorce in 2009. He was a lonely man, as he alienated family. He suffered a lot of demons. He was an abusive alcoholic, and emotionally neglectful father. I hated him for so many reasons. There were so many times when I wanted to give up on our relationship. Most recently, he didn't show up to my youngest daughter's 2nd birthday party, and it was then I thought I would finally cut him off for good. For some reason, I couldn't follow through, and I called him in December so we could try to patch things up. He was drunk when I called, but he said we should touch base again after the holidays and make plans to see each other. From then until his birthday on the 19th, I hadn't heard from him, so I almost didn't text him on his birthday, because I thought he forgot that we had even spoken in December since he was drunk when it happened.

We went to the funeral home on Sunday morning to say goodbye to my dad. We then went to his house, my childhood home, to try to find his will or any paperwork. We walked in to his house to discover that he was a hoarder. He'd been living in filth, with trash and alcohol bottles piled high to the ceiling in every room.

The recliner he died in, and the meal he was eating when he died was still sitting in the living room.

Since then, I've been completely overcome with grief. I've never lost anyone close to me. My dad was someone who had a big spirit. He loved the little things in life. The crisp autumn air. A good book of poetry. Music. His dog. A cup of coffee first thing in the morning. He had a close group of friends, who I've come to find out loved him so dearly. The thing that has probably gotten me through this in some capacity was knowing that he was loved by the friends. It's powerful.

I'm angry at him for giving up. We've come to believe he knew he was dying, and hid it from everyone.

I'm sad knowing he never knew a moments peace in 55 years. His demons were never overcome, and they piled up like the trash in his house for years.

I'm sad I never got to experience the version of the man his friends knew and loved.

I'm gutted that I'll never see my dad again. There is no more time to fix things. There is no more time to reconcile.

He is so much a part of me, and I never realized it until he left.

Grief is confusing. It's compounded when the death comes as a shock, and when the nature of the relationship is fractured. I could never truly let him go. So many people told me I'd be better off without him in my life, since he caused so much pain.

I don't know how I'm supposed to let him go now. When I wake up in the morning, I think of him. When I try to close my eyes, I think of him.

I miss you dad. I'm sorry that you never found peace. I'm sorry for the hand life dealt you. I'm glad you're finally resting. Please give our dog Toasty a big hug from me.

1ixhzja,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1ixhzja/my_wife_accused_me_of_busing_our_kids/,My wife Accused me of busing our kids,"  


I had always considered myself a devoted father and husband. Emily and I had been married for a decade, and our children, Sarah and Ben, were the light of our lives. Our home was filled with laughter, bedtime stories, and the everyday chaos that comes with raising young kids. Life wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it was ours, and I cherished every moment.

  


That sense of normalcy was abruptly shattered one evening when Sarah returned from a playdate unusually quiet. The next morning, Emily took her to the doctor, citing concerns over Sarah‚Äôs behavior. Within hours, I was arrested on charges of child abuse. The evidence? A medical report indicating signs of trauma consistent with abuse.

  


The trial was a blur. Sarah‚Äôs testimony was heart-wrenching. She described incidents that I couldn‚Äôt recall. The jury deliberated, and I was convicted.

  


The conviction was a nightmare. I lost custody of Sarah and Ben. Emily obtained a restraining order, prohibiting me from contacting the children. My parents, cousins, and friends turned their backs, believing the worst. My reputation was shattered.

  


Months later, a breakthrough. A private investigator uncovered that Emily had accessed Sarah‚Äôs medical records without consent, a violation of privacy laws. Further investigation revealed that Emily had been seeing a therapist who specialized in child trauma. The therapist‚Äôs notes indicated that Emily had been coaching Sarah on what to say.

  


Armed with this new evidence, my legal team appealed the conviction. The court overturned the verdict, citing prosecutorial misconduct and new evidence. I was exonerated.

  


Rebuilding my life was challenging. Emily faced charges for filing a false report and child endangerment. I sought therapy to heal from the trauma. Slowly, I reconnected with my children, who had been manipulated into believing I was guilty. The road to healing was long, but I was determined to restore my family.

  


During this tumultuous period, I met someone new. Her name was Lisa, and she was a colleague at the law firm where I had been working part-time during the trial. Lisa had been a pillar of support throughout my legal battles, offering encouragement and a listening ear.

  


At first, our relationship was purely professional. We would discuss case strategies and share insights over coffee. But as time passed, our conversations delved deeper into personal matters. Lisa shared stories of her own struggles, and I found solace in her understanding.

  


One evening, after a particularly grueling day at work, Lisa invited me to dinner. We dined at a cozy Italian restaurant, and the conversation flowed effortlessly. We laughed, reminisced about our favorite movies, and shared our dreams for the future. It was during this dinner that I realized how much I had come to care for her.

  


Our relationship blossomed slowly. We spent weekends exploring the city, attending art exhibitions, and trying new cuisines. Lisa introduced me to her circle of friends, and I was welcomed with open arms. Her friends were warm and supportive, and they made me feel like I was part of their family.

  


As our bond deepened, I felt a sense of hope that I hadn‚Äôt experienced in years. Lisa‚Äôs unwavering support and love helped me heal from the scars of my past. She encouraged me to pursue my passions and reminded me of my worth.

  


One afternoon, Lisa invited me to her family gathering. Her parents, siblings, and extended family were all present. They welcomed me with open arms, and I felt a sense of belonging that I had longed for. We shared stories, played games, and enjoyed a hearty meal together. It was a reminder of the family dynamics I had once cherished.

  


As Sarah and Ben grew older, they began to question the events of their childhood. They had memories of me that didn‚Äôt align with the narrative Emily had painted. They reached out to me, seeking the truth. I shared my side of the story, and they listened with open hearts.

  


The truth eventually came to light. Sarah and Ben confronted Emily about her actions. They expressed their feelings of betrayal and hurt. Emily, faced with the undeniable truth, confessed to her deceit. The legal system took its course, and Emily was held accountable for her actions.

  


Rebuilding my relationship with Sarah and Ben was a journey. There were tears, apologies, and moments of healing. But with time, patience, and love, we began to rebuild the bond that had been severed

1ixhz4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/hypotheticalsituation/comments/1ixhz4k/magic_greenhouse/,Magic Greenhouse,"Here's one I've been toying with for a while.

You have a magic greenhouse. This greenhouse is capable of growing any plant, regardless of climate, with the perfect growing conditions. Perfect soil, perfect sunlight, perfect humidity, etc. No diseases or parasites. No matter where you live, you will be able to grow any plant in this greenhouse. All of your plants are magically pollinated as well, so you don't have to worry about caring for whatever various pollinators would otherwise be needed. The greenhouse can support plants as large as trees, though you wouldn't know it from the outside. Anything planted in the greenhouse will reach maturity within one year, so you don't need to wait decades depending on the plant. Plants will also be able to support their own reproductive cycles, so once they are established in your greenhouse you'll be able to grow them indefinitely.

Here are the limitations:
1) The greenhouse can house up to 3 separate plant species.
2) The greenhouse is capable of growing only enough in a year to support one household (for food plants), or the equivalent. You will never be able to grow enough to monetize the greenhouse no matter what plant you have, though you would probably be able to give some of your plants/produce to friends and family. Kinda like having extra eggs from your backyard chickens. Nothing specifically prevents you from sharing your plants, but you won't get rich from whatever you're growing.
3) Science cannot recreate the greenhouse. If any damage is done to the greenhouse in an attempt to replicate it, its magic is lost forever.
4) Plants still have to follow their normal annual cycles. However, the timing of the growing seasons will shift to align with your local season. So, for example, if something would normally be in season in spring south of the equator and you live north of the equator, then the plant is in season during northern spring time.
5) The greenhouse does not create the plants. It only provides the ideal growing circumstances. You can't grow anything unless you can obtain seeds/cuttings/saplings/etc.

What three plants would you grow?

(As an aside: the inspiration for this came from my curiosity about different fruits that grow in other parts of the world but that don't travel well. There are a lot of things I would love to try, but I'd have to travel hundreds or thousanda of miles. And there are other things  that do travel well, but that I just wish I could grow myself, like coffee. So, I'm curious what others  would do with a magic greenhouse. Despite my initial inspiration being about fruits, I didn't want to constrain people to only growing food plants.)

I also recently increased my dose of Zepbound to 10mg which I think is the highest I would like to go. I love chewing gum and always get sugar free, but I have had some difficulty sleeping and find myself having about 4 pieces throughout the night, during the day I probably have another 4 pieces; so that is a lot of artificial sweetener which I suspect is contributing to this upset stomach. To complicate the matter I use Relistor for opioid induced constipation which I tolerate far better than any other medication in that category, however, I certainly feel it is playing a role in my GI issues. The symptoms are so unpredictable, some days I feel fine all day long, while others are quiet debilitating. So my plan is to reduce the gum, continue eating lean, high protein meals, have smaller portions, and reduce caffeine intake which is the other thing I have yet to mention. I have a hard time waking up in the morning due to insomnia and sleep apnea, so I've been feeling the need to take a caffeine supplement or at least have some type of caffeinated beverage to get going. Carbonated, caffeinated beverages are by far the worst. The higher caffeine, the worse. I like tea but it can leave me feeling tired due to the theanine.

It's a crossover story I'm writing and would like some help with. So I play a cozy game called Coffee Talk. It's about a Coffee shop only open at night in a parallel version of our world that has Orc, Vampires, Werewolves, Elves, Aliens as normal everyday people with humans. And one day my brain just said: ""Hey, what would happen if the Barista (the MC character in the game) came to the MCU and got caught up in the shenanigans?""

The idea starts like this:

The Barista falls through a portal, as due to a government experiment with Pixie Dust/Fairy Dust gone wrong had them popping up everywhere, and landing in the MCU. They (I'm placing them as a she but that's just me) make contact with SHEILD and set up a new shop in New Mexico, making friends with the important people and using some of her powers to help, but not all of them. She ends up finding Thor and Loki in her back yard, both banished in THOR 1 with Baldur from the Myths taking the Villan role Loki had.

1ixhswo,https://www.reddit.com/r/wirelessearbudsreview/comments/1ixhswo/explore_the_best_wireless_earphones_beats/,Explore the best wireless earphones Beats Powerbeats Pro review: Are they worth it?,"**Design & Build Quality**  
The first thing that caught my eye with the Beats Powerbeats Pro is their sleek and modern design. These wireless earphones sport a hook-like shape that wraps comfortably around your ears, ensuring they stay put even during intense workouts. The material feels durable yet lightweight, making them easy to wear for extended periods. While the charging case is bulkier than I anticipated, it feels sturdy and well-built. However, slipping it into a pocket isn‚Äôt exactly convenient due to its size. I found the matte finish on both the earphones and the case to be a nice touch, as it resists fingerprints and minor scratches.

**Fit & Comfort**  
Adjustable ear hooks on the Beats Powerbeats Pro are a game changer for me. I‚Äôve tried other earphones that constantly needed readjusting, but not these. They provide a secure fit without digging into my ears, which is a huge plus during long runs or gym sessions. The four different ear tip sizes included in the box made it easy to find the perfect fit. I even asked a coworker to try them out since they have smaller ears, and they agreed that the fit was snug. However, if you‚Äôre someone with particularly small or oddly shaped ears, you might take a bit longer to find the right configuration.

[Check Beats Powerbeats Pro price on Amazon.](https://wirelessemporium.com/check/b08q8p69jz/)

**Sound Quality & Performance**  
The sound quality on these earphones is undeniably impressive. Bass-heavy tracks came to life, and I could feel the thump during my workouts. Crisp mids and highs ensured podcasts or audiobooks were equally enjoyable. Compared to other earphones I‚Äôve used, the Powerbeats Pro delivers a balanced and immersive audio experience. However, audiophiles seeking a more neutral sound might find the bass slightly overpowering. I tested the earphones across various genres, from pop to classical, and they consistently performed well.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
Battery life is another strong suit for the Powerbeats Pro. With up to nine hours of listening time on a single charge, I rarely found myself reaching for the charging case. On days with heavy usage, the case provided an additional 24 hours of juice, which was more than enough to last me through the week. The Fast Fuel feature also came in handy; just five minutes of charging gave me over an hour of playtime. I do wish the case supported wireless charging, though, as fumbling with cables can be inconvenient.

**Noise Cancellation & Ambient Mode**  
While the Powerbeats Pro doesn‚Äôt include active noise cancellation, the ear tips provide decent passive noise isolation. This was enough to block out most gym noises or mild chatter at the coffee shop. That being said, I did miss having an ambient mode for outdoor runs or when walking in busy areas. It would have been helpful to quickly toggle between being immersed and staying aware of my surroundings.

**Durability & Water Resistance**  
I tested these earphones during several sweaty workouts, and they held up well without any performance issues. The reinforced design for sweat and water resistance makes them a reliable option for fitness enthusiasts. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend using them in heavy rain or submerging them in water, as they aren‚Äôt fully waterproof. A friend who used them during their cycling sessions in light drizzle had no problems, but they were cautious not to push the limits.

**Warranty**  
The warranty coverage is adequate, but I did notice mixed feedback online about Apple‚Äôs customer service when handling warranty claims for these earphones. Some users reported issues with sweat damage not being covered, which is ironic for a product marketed towards fitness enthusiasts. I haven‚Äôt personally faced any issues requiring warranty support, but it‚Äôs worth keeping this in mind.

**Advantages**

* Secure and adjustable fit
* Impressive sound quality with rich bass
* Long battery life and quick charging
* Durable and sweat-resistant

**Drawbacks**

* Bulky charging case
* Lack of active noise cancellation and ambient mode
* Limited warranty coverage for sweat-related damage

**Direct Competitors**  
When comparing the Powerbeats Pro to other wireless earphones like the Apple AirPods Pro or the Jabra Elite 75t, a few distinctions stood out. The AirPods Pro shines with its active noise cancellation and smaller charging case, but it lacks the secure fit that the ear hooks of the Powerbeats Pro provide. Meanwhile, the Jabra Elite 75t offers a more compact design and better water resistance, but the audio quality doesn‚Äôt quite match the Powerbeats Pro‚Äôs bass-heavy signature. If you prioritize a secure fit and long battery life over noise cancellation, these might be the better choice.

**Smart Spending**  
Evaluating the price point of the Powerbeats Pro, I‚Äôd say they offer decent value for fitness enthusiasts who want high-performance earphones. While they may feel a bit pricey compared to some alternatives, the audio quality, secure fit, and sweat resistance justify the investment. If you‚Äôre someone who uses earphones daily for workouts or commuting, these are worth considering.

A review of its performance and features.,"Testing the CuZn UC-200 under-counter water filter for the past few months has been an eye-opening experience for me. Having struggled with less efficient water filtration systems in the past, I decided to upgrade, and this model caught my eye due to its promise of a five-year lifespan and easy installation. As someone who values clean, crisp water for drinking and cooking, I had high hopes, and for the most part, it delivered.

**Ease of Installation & Use**

Installing the CuZn UC-200 was surprisingly straightforward. Equipped with clear instructions and all the necessary parts (though a wrench was required), I had it set up within 20 minutes. Unlike other systems that often involve drilling or complicated setups, this filter attaches directly to the kitchen sink's cold-water line. The simplicity here is a big win for anyone, even those without extensive DIY skills. However, I did run into a small hiccup when connecting it to my older plumbing, which required an additional adapter. Thankfully, CuZn's customer support was quick to send me the appropriate parts free of charge, which was a lifesaver.

[Check CuZn UC-200 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b000923524/)

**Filtration Technology & Effectiveness**

The CuZn UC-200 utilizes a three-stage filtration process, which combines micro-sediment membranes, KDF-55, and coconut shell carbon. While it doesn't reduce TDS levels (total dissolved solids), it effectively removes chlorine, harmful contaminants, and unpleasant tastes or odors. My initial concern about the lack of TDS reduction diminished once I realized the filter retains beneficial minerals. Testing the water with chlorine test strips showed consistent results, proving its filtration efficiency. The water tasted incredibly clean, which even impressed my skeptical partner, who previously refused to drink tap water.

**Filter Lifespan & Replacement**

One of the standout features of the CuZn UC-200 is its long filter lifespan‚Äîup to five years or 50,000 gallons, depending on usage. This is a game-changer for someone like me who was tired of constantly replacing filters every few months with other systems. While I haven't reached the five-year mark yet, the performance so far suggests it may hold up to its claims. CuZn also offers a warranty, covering early filter expiration, which adds peace of mind.

**Capacity & Suitability**

This filter is designed for municipal water systems, so those relying on private well water may need to explore other options. Its capacity is ideal for families, as it easily accommodates daily drinking and cooking needs without any noticeable reduction in water pressure. For someone like me, who uses filtered water for everything from making coffee to rinsing vegetables, it has been a reliable addition to my kitchen.

**Flow Rate & Performance**

The water flow rate remains consistent, unlike other systems I've used that dramatically reduced water pressure. Even during peak usage in my household, the CuZn UC-200 didn't falter. This was particularly helpful on busy mornings when multiple family members were using the kitchen sink.

**Certifications**

The CuZn UC-200 doesn't have official certifications like NSF/ANSI, which some users might find disappointing. However, the testing results and numerous reviews I researched suggest that its performance matches or even exceeds many certified systems. It's worth considering whether official certifications are a priority for you or if real-world performance is enough.

**Warranty**

One of the things that impressed me was the five-year prorated performance warranty. CuZn's excellent customer support adds to the value of this warranty. When I encountered a minor issue with the fittings, the company promptly sent replacements and followed up to ensure everything was running smoothly. It's rare to find companies as responsive and dedicated as CuZn.

**Advantages**

* Long-lasting filter lifespan, up to five years
* Easy and quick installation with no drilling required
* Retains beneficial minerals while removing contaminants
* Excellent customer support and warranty
* Consistent water flow and no pressure drop

**Drawbacks**

* Lacks official NSF/ANSI certification
* Not suitable for private well water
* Requires additional adapters for some older plumbing systems

**Competitive Options**

Comparing the CuZn UC-200 to other under-sink filtration systems, such as the APEC WFS-1000 and Aquasana AQ-5300, it holds its ground quite well. While the APEC model offers a similar filtration process and costs slightly less, it requires filter replacements every 12 months, which adds to long-term costs. Aquasana's system, on the other hand, has NSF certifications but involves more complex installation and higher maintenance. The CuZn UC-200 stands out for its balance of simplicity, effectiveness, and long-term affordability.

**Value for Money**

When weighing the CuZn UC-200's performance against its cost, it's clear that it offers substantial value. The initial investment might seem high, but the five-year lifespan and lack of frequent filter replacements save money over time. For someone like me, who previously relied on pitcher filters that required constant refills and replacements, the convenience alone is worth the price.

Hey guys! Thanks for stopping by and taking the time to read this. It might be a long one, but figured I'd share just in case anyone can relate, or in case this might help someone in the future. Please feel free to ask any questions about anything you'd like!  
  
**Childhood**  
  
To begin, I was raised by a family of alcoholics. Both of my parents, and at least 3/4 of my grandparents were alcoholics (the remaining one passed away before I was born). My earliest memories are of drunk people yelling and fighting. My grandparents house on my mom's side was always a party house. My grandparents had 8 kids, they all loved to party, and there was always something going on at that house, and it always led to fighting. As a kid, I truly couldn't understand why anyone would even drink in the first place.  
  
My parents split when I was around 6. It didn't really bother me too much; my dad was never around anyways. He would often get paid on Friday and not come home until Monday. We actually have a home video where my dad was sitting at our dining room table, very clearly drunk, kind of swaying and looking like he was trying to hold in vomit, and my little 5 year old ass walks up to him and says ""dad, I think you need some tequila.""  
  
Anyways, as I got into my teen years, I lived with my mom and would see my dad on weekends, who was now sober and becoming VERY invested in AA. He is a very hardworking guy, and within a few years he had his own business and was doing very very well for himself. He purchased a house, had a new wife, and was enjoying taking my brother and I on vacations and doing things he could never afford to do when he was younger. I would often go to his meetings with him, so I knew the drills. I got up and read the steps and traditions a few times. I liked getting cookies and coffee. At this point, being around 13 years old, it was clear to me that never having a sip of alcohol was the clear way through life. If I never drink I'll never have to deal with any of this.   
  
**First trauma**  
  
When I was 14, and living with my mom still, one day changed everything for me. I went to school like any other day. After school I took the bus to one of my friends houses after school, which my mom knew I was going to do, and she was going to pick me up later. Shortly after arriving at this friend's house, my mom's boyfriend at the time called me crying, and my mom was crying in the background. He told me he had to pick me up right away. When they arrived to get me, I got the news - my brother and I had to move in with my dad full time, starting that day. I was so confused and upset - I didn't know my dad very well and I was terrified. It turns out my mom had been using meth, and my dad had suspicions about it and had been fighting for full custody of my brother and I for a few months. My mom failed a drug test in court that day and they gave my dad emergency custody of us.  
  
Looking back, it was probably one of the best things that could have happened to me. I was getting involved with gangs and just being kind of a bad kid. That all stopped when I moved in with my dad, but at the time I was angry and so, so sad. All I wanted was my mom to get clean and to move back with her, which unfortunately never happened. She did get clean, but by the time she was getting things together I was already turning 18.  
  
**My first drink**   
  
I was 17 years old, and went to one of my friends houses, we will call him Zeke (coincidentally the same friend from earlier). Our other friend, we'll call him Nelson, came over as well. Zeke's parents were gone for the night, and the plan was for us to stay over and play World of Warcraft all night. Nelson and I brought our PC's and were all set up in Zeke's basement for a long night of gaming.  
  
At one point, Zeke went upstairs to eat. Nelson opened his backpack and showed me he had a bit of jack daniels left in a bottle. I don't know why or what was different about this night - i had easily avoided drinking up until this day. But for some reason I decided, fuck it, what harm could a few drinks do? I had been to enough meetings and had seen all of the signs of alcoholism. There is 0% chance that would ever happen to me.  
  
So we poured the rest of the jack into what was left of a 2 liter bottle of coke, making a fairly strong jack and coke bottle. We were passing it back and forth and were getting a pretty good buzz going. Zeke came back and had no idea we were drinking in his house.  At one point, Zeke asked for a drink of the coke. We kinda giggled and passed him the bottle. He took a drink, and says ""...you guys are fucking drinking in my house and you didn't even tell me???"". We all laughed, and then the party started. Zeke's parents had a liquor cabinet, with costco bottles of every type of liquor imaginable. We just drank a bit from each one, so that they wouldn't be able to notice. I threw up that night, but had an overall good time. Drinking wasn't so bad!  
  
I continued to drink fairly casually for the following 10 years or so. I had some long relationships, and was only drinking on the weekends for the most part, and with friends. Things were going well, and then I met Jackie.  
  
Jackie lived a couple states away, about 16 hours in a car from me. I met her through my brother, as she was the cousin of my brothers girlfriend at the time. Even though we hadn't met in person, there was something special about her, and we clicked and fell for each other hard. She was so kind, caring, and loving. She was the most beautiful person I had ever met, inside and out. I ended up flying to meet her after talking to her for only 4 months. In person it felt the same as it did just talking to her, and we got engaged very quickly.  
  
Jackie was going to community college and was planning to transfer to a college in my state, as they have an amazing medical program. Our life plan together seemed to be coming together, everything was falling into place and going the way we wanted it to. We had the same life goals, the same ideals. We would take turns every month or 2 flying to each other and spending weekends together. Her mom and dad drove her up here at one point to meet my entire family, and her mom and my mom were instant friends. Everything was perfect.  
  
And then...the night that changed everything.  
  
I was at home, still living with my dad. I was 25 at this point, working full time, and trying to put everything together for Jackie and mines futures. I haven't mentioned him before, but I had a really good friend whom I met in 8th grade, named Charlie. Charlie and I were inseparable when we met - he would stay with me every weekend, and we hung out most weeknights as well. He was truly my best friend. After high school, he moved into the middle of nowhere with his grandma. He wa often isolating and hard to reach, but we would talk somewhat regularly and play games together often. On this horrible, horrible night, I received a text message from our mutual friend Alyssa. Alyssa told me that Charlie's brother had texted her and had told her that Charlie had taken his own life. Charlie's brother was a heroin addict so I didn't fully believe him. I was friends with Charlie's dad on Facebook so I messaged him and said ""I just heard something awful about Charlie...please tell me it isn't true."" His response...""it's true...I just kissed my son goodbye"".  
  
This night broke me. I cried harder than I had ever cried. My brother, who's bedroom was right across a hallway from mine, was also close with Charlie. I went to his room crying, and the only words that could come out were ""Charlie killed himself."" We both hugged and cried and cried. I texted my dad and asked him to come up, as he was also close with Charlie and had spent a lot of time with him at our house, and we all cried together.  
  
**The alcoholism**  
  
Charlie's passing was the beginning of a downward spiral. It didn't happen super quickly, and I didn't even realize that it was the start of my heavy drinking until I worked through this with a therapist in the last couple of years. I had slowly started drinking on a weeknight or 2...and then 3....and then every day. I was able to hide my drinking from Jackie since she lived so far away. I would constantly lie to her about it. Her and I lasted a while together after that, though our last night together was pretty awful.   
  
We were on Skype, chatting and got into a fight over who knows what. Of course I was drunk. My mom lived one street away from me, and texted me asking if I wanted to come over for steak, and that my youngest brother (from a different dad) and his girlfriend and her friend were over. I said sure and told Jackie I needed to get away for a bit and was going to my mom's.   
  
The moment I arrived at my mom's, my brothers girlfriends friend (we'll call her Andrea) locked eyes. There was this weird feeling between us that both shared, but I didn't really think too much of it. We all ate together, and my mom also being an alcoholic had vodka in abundance, so we drank a lot.  
  
I woke up the next morning at my house with Andrea in my bed. My memory was spotty but ultimately I knew what happened. I decided to break up with Jackie instead of telling her what I did. I justified it by telling myself It would give her trust issues, and it'd be better for me to burden myself with what I've done instead of hurting her with it.  
  
The spiral truly started here. I was drinking at minimum a fifth of vodka per day, usually more. A fifth wouldn't get me drunk, it was just enough to keep me chill and having a good time. I was waking in the middle of the night and drinking from my bottle. At this point, my brother and I had an apartment together, and he was drinking heavily as well. I met a drug dealer and started doing cocaine, and started selling cocaine, xanax, and others. I was actually really enjoying life at this point; I was partying all the time, I was super popular because of the drugs, I had tons of cash, and more women wanted me than I knew what to do with (though they really wanted the drugs).  
  
I kept this up for about 6 months. My brother and I ultimately lost the apartment. My mother and I got an apartment together after this, which also wasn't good. At some point during this my brother got sober, and I was partying often with my mom. I had stopped the drugs, and was hardly functioning anymore. I was throwing up bile daily, having tons of internal issues. I had gained 60 pounds. I couldn't get myself to work. I was going down fast.  
  
**Sobriety part 1**  
  
At this point I decided it was time to ""take a break"". I had realized that drinking had become a problem, and at that point in my life I wasn't capable of drinking casually. My plan was to quit until I felt like I was at a point where I could drink casually. And this is where Hailey comes in. I was sober and decided it was time to be in a relationship again. There was a girl who I had met at a party years ago who I was friends with on Facebook. We had a lot of mutual friends so we had seen each other often and hung out a few times over the years. The weather was nice and I had a convertible, so I asked if she wanted to go on a drive. Shortly thereafter, she became my girlfriend.  
  
**The relapse**  
  
A couple of months into us dating, I felt like I could comfortably drink casually again. I told Hailey and she told me it was an awful idea. Unfortunately I had to figure that out for myself. Once I started drinking, I messaged Jackie and begged for her back. She sent the screenshots to Hailey, who left me immediately. I stopped going to work. I was drinking nearly a half gallon of vodka per day. My mom and I lost our apartment. We started couch hopping together at various families houses, meanwhile maxing my credit cards.   
  
**Rock bottom**  
  
Eventually our family was tired of us, so we stayed in a motel for a few days. During this time, her and I were just binge drinking. One morning, the motel staff knocked on our door, and told us we had to leave. We were out of money. So now we had no money, no liquor, and nowhere to stay. It was time to sleep on the street. This terrified me, so I called my dad. He was nearing 20 years of sobriety at this point. I told him that I was done, and I needed help. This was November 6th, 2019, my sobriety date.  
  
I moved into a trailer behind his business and binged sugar for a couple of days until the withdrawals were gone. I got back to work and started trying to rebuild. AA isn't for me - it just doesn't work with the way my mind does, so I decided to go at it alone. I really, truly just don't want to drink. The thought of alcohol makes me nauseous. I knew at this point, I can NEVER casually drink, and that alcohol will never touch my lips again, and im okay with it.  
  
**The rebuild**  
  
I made amends to Hailey, and told her that I really did love her, and that I understood if she never wanted anything to do with me again. I told her regardless, I am recovering and I will make amends to her by living life the best I can and being the best person I can be. Eventually she wanted to see me in person, and after a while we started dating again. I'm happy to say, we have been married for 3 years now, and are very happy. We have 2 cats, im working full time and making a lot of money, as is she. We are planning our future together and working hard for it. We'll be moving to a big city soon for her work and I can't wait for that chapter of our lives. I've also lost 70 pounds of fat and have gained a bunch of muscle. I've come so far in every aspect of my life and I'm so proud, and will continue to get better and grow. However, that doesn't mean life is perfect.  
  
**Struggles in sobriety**   
  
My past often comes back to haunt me. Previous conversations with people, previous debts, etc have found their way back into my life. The feeling that I get when I feel like I've finally caught up financially, only to see a new collections on my credit report is absolutely horrible. It's the worst feeling to know I've been working on being the best I can be, but I still can't seem to get where I want to. But I continue to fight and work hard, and I know one day I'll get better.   
  
I work with a therapist on these things, as well as talking about what I consider my biggest regret - Jackie. I'm over her romantically, but I'm still not over what I did and how I made her feel. Part of me still hates myself for cheating and ruining those years of her life. We have talked once since then where she told me she's forgiven me and that it's okay to forgive myself...but I still haven't been able to. I just continue to put all my love and energy into my relationship with Hailey, treasure her, and make sure I never hurt her the way that I've hurt others. Someday I hope I can forgive myself, but that day has yet to come.  
  
If you've read this far, thank you, and I hope there's something in here that can help you. Since I don't attend AA, I've never really gotten to share my story before. This has been therapeutic for me to lay it all out and tell my story. I'm sorry it's disorganized, I've never really written anything like this before. Anyways, if there's anything you want to know more about, I'm happy to answer any questions.

1ixhkxo,https://www.reddit.com/r/TheBagCheck/comments/1ixhkxo/does_the_swissgear_7366100154_carryon_luggage/,Does the SwissGear 7366100154 carry-on luggage deliver on its promises? A detailed review,"Using the SwissGear 7366100154 carry-on luggage for my frequent travels has been quite an experience. As someone who juggles between business trips and personal getaways, finding a reliable, functional, and stylish suitcase has always been a priority. Here‚Äôs my honest take on this carry-on after putting it through the rigors of everyday travel.

**Design & Materials**  
The sleek and modern aesthetic of this carry-on immediately caught my attention. Its white hardshell exterior exudes sophistication while being resistant to scuffs and scratches. Made from durable ABS, the material feels robust yet surprisingly lightweight. The co-molded handles with soft rubber grips are a thoughtful addition, ensuring comfort even when lugging it through crowded airports. However, I did notice that the handle picks up marks quite easily, though they aren't permanent and can be wiped clean.

**Weight & Portability**  
At just 6.9 pounds, this suitcase is perfect for those who want to travel light without compromising on capacity. The spinner wheels, which glide effortlessly in all directions, have been a lifesaver. Navigating tight spaces, like busy terminals or hotel lobbies, felt like a breeze. However, during a trip to a cobblestone town, I noticed the wheels struggled a bit and showed signs of wear. While not a dealbreaker, it‚Äôs something to consider if your travels frequently involve uneven terrains.

**Features**  
This carry-on packs a ton of features for its compact size. The split-case design is a standout; it allows for better organization, especially when dealing with formal wear or fragile items. The fold-out cup holder, though quirky, was a fun addition. I used it to hold my coffee while waiting in long security lines, and it felt like an extra hand. The TSA-approved lock adds a layer of security, giving peace of mind when checking in the luggage.

**Capacity & Organization**  
The 53-liter capacity is surprisingly spacious for a 19-inch carry-on. I fit clothing for a week-long trip, toiletries, and even a pair of shoes without having to expand it. The internal compartments and zippered pockets kept everything in place, though I did wish the middle divider had additional zippered compartments for smaller items. Expanding the suitcase offered even more packing flexibility, perfect for those who can‚Äôt resist shopping during their travels.

**Size & Airline Compatibility**  
Measuring 22 x 14.25 x 10 inches with wheels and handles, this carry-on is designed to meet most airline cabin luggage requirements. I had no trouble fitting it into overhead compartments on domestic and international flights. However, I‚Äôd recommend double-checking with your airline, as some budget carriers have stricter size limits.

**Security & Locking System**  
The integrated TSA lock is easy to use and feels secure. Setting it up took only a few minutes, and it worked seamlessly throughout my trips. However, a minor downside is the lack of clarity in the instructions for first-time users. A quick online search resolved this, but it might be a slight inconvenience for some.

**Handles & Comfort**  
The retractable telescopic handle is smooth and sturdy, locking into place at different heights. This adjustability made it comfortable for both me and my taller partner to use. The co-molded lift handles on the top and side were equally comfortable, even when lifting the suitcase onto overhead compartments.

**Weather Resistance**  
Rainy weather didn‚Äôt faze this suitcase. The hardshell construction kept my belongings dry, and the zippers seemed to have some level of water resistance. However, I wouldn‚Äôt recommend exposing it to heavy downpours for extended periods without additional protection.

**Warranty**  
SwissGear‚Äôs 10-year warranty against defects in materials and workmanship is a major plus. It speaks volumes about the brand‚Äôs confidence in the product‚Äôs durability. I haven‚Äôt had to use the warranty yet, but knowing it‚Äôs there adds to the overall value.

**Upsides**

* Lightweight yet durable design.
* Smooth 360-degree spinner wheels for easy navigation.
* TSA-approved lock for added security.

**Areas of Concern**

* Wheels may not hold up well on rough surfaces like cobblestones.
* The interior divider lacks extra compartments for small items.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this suitcase to Samsonite and American Tourister carry-ons, the SwissGear model holds its own. It‚Äôs more affordable than the Samsonite options while offering similar durability and features. However, the wheels on Samsonite models tend to perform better on uneven surfaces. American Tourister, on the other hand, lacks the sleek design and premium feel of the SwissGear but is a great budget-friendly alternative. If style and mid-range pricing are your priorities, this carry-on is a solid choice.

**Value Proposition**  
For a mid-priced carry-on, the SwissGear 7366100154 offers excellent value. Its combination of durability, functionality, and style makes it a worthy investment for frequent travelers. While it‚Äôs not perfect, the minor flaws are outweighed by its overall performance and thoughtful features.

I think I lost mine today because of a cafe messing up an order and I'm pretty peeved.,"So I started dashing again recently and managed to get my acceptance above 70% and my customer rating 5.0, which meant I activated gold status for the first time two days ago. I got some pretty well-paying orders so I think it helped.

Then today I notice my customer rating is down to 4.33 which means I've lost my gold status to get high paying orders. I'm guessing it's because of an order I got the other day for 3 drinks from a coffee place, the place handed me one of those large brown paper bags which could easily fit three drinks, it was stapled so I couldn't check inside it but trusted it had all the drinks in it because they handed me the bag and said have a good day. I drop it off and find out it's missing a drink, I explain to the customer it's what the store gave me and I'll contact support to help you, they seemed okay with it but I'm wondering if it's what I lost my rating on. I'm really annoyed if I lost my status over this because it was entirely out of my control. 

  
The other weird thing is on the customer reviews page it says all my reviews are 5 stars, but then on the main page which all your stats it says 4.33.

Is there any tips for getting it back up to above 4.5?",3,1740442803.0,DoorDashDrivers,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôre staying with family of hers in Long Island. I am so so excited, as I have never gone this far from home before (we‚Äôre 21 and 22y/o) and it will be such an amazing experience, but i‚Äôm also TERRIFIED. 

I deal with chronic constipation. I just don‚Äôt seem to get the urge to have bowel movements as much as I should. I‚Äôve been going through a good rhythm lately, but I can literally only seem to go to the bathroom when I‚Äôm at home sitting or lying down (I cannot go when I‚Äôm out and about) and when I have a coffee. So I‚Äôm really worried that I‚Äôm not going to able to use the bathroom for the full 10 days that I‚Äôm over there. I get quite anxious about this in case I get seriously ill and have to go to the hospital, and I also just don‚Äôt want to be miserable for the trip of a lifetime. 

The one thing that is calming me a little is the fact that we‚Äôre going to be in the comfort of a home rather than a hotel room. I‚Äôll have a few bathroom options and we spoke about how we can take a day or 2 to stay in and sunbathe out the back, or explore the local area of long island. I‚Äôm hoping that if I can have a coffee in the morning, I can then sit down for about 15 minutes to relax and hope things get moving. I could explain this to her and I know she wouldn‚Äôt judge me either. 


I just am very worried. This may sound TMI, but if I‚Äôm struggling to go to the bathroom and if I‚Äôm taking laxatives, I get very gassy and sometimes it has a lot of odor and I get crampy. I worry about how I will hide this in somebody else‚Äôs home. Or if I have to run to the bathroom. I usually take Fybohel when I need it as this tends to keep me regular without the crampy and gas of other laxatives. 

I‚Äôm  basically just looking for some reassurance or advice. New York is a once in a lifetime trip, for me especially, and I really don‚Äôt want to let my stomach issues ruin this trip. I want to be on cloud 9, I don‚Äôt want to be stressed and anxious the entire time :/ ",2,1740442718.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1ixhihk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Nataliya_K-5685/comments/1ixhihk/my_system_had_a_glitch/,My System Had a Glitch,"For context, I‚Äôve been aiming to live mostly sugar-free for a while now. I have a system that works well for me, but last week, it cracked a little.

Last Friday, we were at the hospital visiting my mother-in-law. We stopped at a coffee shop to get her a coffee and a snack for my kid. When asked if I wanted anything, I said, ‚ÄúNo, thank you.‚Äù But then, I approached the counter just to see what was there. Almost at once, two people said, ‚ÄúPick something‚Äîthis is your last chance.‚Äù

The pressure and urgency cracked me, and I got a blondie. I watched myself in almost slow motion, not quite believing what I was doing. A part of me didn‚Äôt want it, yet for some reason, I said yes. So, I kept watching myself.

At the first bite, I thought,¬†*Well, that wasn‚Äôt worth it at all*¬†(I‚Äôve found that it very rarely is). I ate the blondie and resumed my sugar-free adventure the very next day.

But I had food for thought. I wanted to process what had happened so I could learn from it.

When I go back to that moment‚Äîthe moment I decided to get the dessert‚Äîand slow down, zooming in on my inner world, I notice a few things. The easiest way to avoid this would have been to stay back and not approach the counter. Staying disengaged from what was there would have been super helpful.

But I¬†*did*¬†approach the counter. I¬†*did*¬†express out loud that those smashed cookies looked interesting. That stimulated my curiosity, and saying it out loud cued the people around me that I was interested. I remember thinking,¬†*I wonder what that tastes like.*¬†And that‚Äôs very much like me‚ÄîI like trying new flavors.

But then, someone outside of me introduced pressure and urgency. Their words sounded like an instruction:¬†*Pick something. Last chance.*¬†I panicked a little. And in that moment, in that crack, my FOMO got to make the choice. My automatic response kicked in‚ÄîI didn‚Äôt want to miss out, so I ordered.

Urgency and pressure are everywhere. They‚Äôre used in marketing¬†*every single day*. And they work.

So now, I need to figure out a plan for handling urgency and pressure when they show up. Normally, I‚Äôm pretty good at not giving in. I¬†*know*¬†that urgency is almost always manufactured and not real. In the case of the coffee shop, if I truly wanted that dessert, I could have ordered it later‚Äîthere was¬†*no*¬†actual urgency. The only reason it worked on me was that, for a moment, I believed in it.

# What‚Äôs my solution and strategy here?

First, I‚Äôm going to be kind to myself because this is¬†*not*¬†the end of the world. So far this year, I‚Äôve had 44 sugar-free days out of 54. And even on the days I ate sugar, I didn‚Äôt binge. I consciously enjoyed and savored my desserts.

Second, I‚Äôll remind myself that most of the time, urgency isn‚Äôt real‚Äîespecially when it comes to buying things. It‚Äôs not life-threatening. I‚Äôll use this experience to make myself stronger and wiser.

Third, keep my thoughts to myself.  If I didn't blurted out loud that something looked interesting, most likely people would be quiet.

# Personal power and sovereignty.

I remember the exact moment I made the choice. And I take full responsibility for it. I‚Äôve confirmed, once again, that I wouldn‚Äôt have missed out on¬†*anything*¬†if I had said no. And I‚Äôll use that knowledge next time. No regrets either.

Now, time to release and let it go. Today is Monday, and I‚Äôm on day three of being sugar-free. I‚Äôm counting days because it‚Äôs fun for now‚Äîit gives me a clear perspective and shows me how I‚Äôm doing. But I also know that at some point, I‚Äôll let that go too.

So, that‚Äôs it. That‚Äôs the glitch, and that‚Äôs how I patched it up.

What do you do when you commit to something and then have a glitch? How do you treat yourself in that situation? Do you completely give up? Do you beat yourself up? What‚Äôs your response to glitches?

Let me know in the comments‚ÄîI‚Äôd love to hear. And if you‚Äôd like some help dealing with the glitches in¬†*your*¬†system, ask me! I‚Äôm really good at helping people figure things out.",1,1740442654.0,u_Nataliya_K-5685,0,1.0,False

1ixhgvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ixhgvp/does_the_delonghi_ec260bk_manual_espresso_machine/,Does the De'Longhi EC260BK Manual Espresso Machine Make Barista-Quality Coffee at Home? A Full Review,"Testing out the De'Longhi EC260BK Stilosa Manual Espresso Machine has been an exciting journey for someone like me, who treasures a good cup of coffee. If you're wondering whether this manual espresso machine can create barista-quality lattes and cappuccinos, here's my detailed experience with it. From brewing performance to its maintenance quirks, I've got you covered.

**Design & Build Quality**

The first thing that struck me was how sleek and compact this unit is. Its black and stainless steel finish fits perfectly on my kitchen countertop without overwhelming the space. At 8.07 inches deep, 13.5 inches wide, and 11.22 inches tall, it‚Äôs small enough to tuck away but attractive enough to leave out as a centerpiece. It's clear De'Longhi focused on durability, as the machine‚Äôs stainless steel boiler feels robust and dependable. However, the drip tray can feel a bit wobbly, especially when the machine starts brewing. A minor detail, but worth noting if you're as particular as I am.

**Coffee Quality**

This is where the De'Longhi EC260BK truly shines. The 15-bar pump pressure delivers a rich crema on top of every shot, which is something I‚Äôve only previously achieved at a caf√©. Experimenting with different coffee beans and grind sizes has been a fun process. Once I found the right balance, the espresso tasted smooth and full-bodied. However, I did notice that using beans ground too finely led to slower brewing and a slight overflow of water on the grounds, but adjusting the grind coarseness fixed this issue.

[Check De'Longhi EC260BK price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b08c96bg9h/)

**Brewing Performance**

Operating this machine manually gives you a sense of control over your brew, and I appreciate the portafilter's ergonomic design. The machine includes two filters for single and double shots, and I‚Äôve tried both options. While it doesn‚Äôt automatically stop brewing, this actually allowed me to customize my espresso shot size. The machine heats up quickly, and I love seeing the espresso flow evenly into my cup. It's a bit noisy during the brewing process, but that‚Äôs common with most espresso machines in this price range.

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**

Creating frothy milk for cappuccinos and lattes was one of my favorite features to test. The manual milk frother combines steam and milk effortlessly, producing a rich, creamy froth. This feature has turned my weekend mornings into latte art practice sessions. While it‚Äôs great for beginners, I imagine advanced users might find the steam wand‚Äôs capabilities slightly limited for more complex frothing techniques.

**Water Tank & Capacity**

The water tank holds 33.8 fl. oz., which is sufficient for a small household. I found it easy to detach and refill, which is a huge plus when you're multitasking in the kitchen. However, the tank could benefit from clearer markings for water levels. A transparent design would have made it easier to monitor the amount of water remaining.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**

This espresso machine is reasonably energy-efficient, and I appreciate that it doesn‚Äôt draw excessive power when not in use. As I mentioned earlier, it does produce a bit of noise while brewing, but nothing unbearable. If you‚Äôre used to early mornings with a house full of people, the sound might be noticeable, although I quickly got used to it.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**

Keeping the De'Longhi EC260BK clean has been straightforward. The portafilter and drip tray are easy to remove and rinse, which I‚Äôve been doing after every use. The manual even includes detailed instructions for descaling, ensuring that the machine stays in top-notch condition. One thing I would have liked is a more intuitive way to clean the steam wand, as milk residue can build up quickly.

**Warranty & Support**

Knowing that this machine comes with a one-year warranty offers peace of mind. I haven‚Äôt had to contact customer service yet, but it‚Äôs great to have the option should anything go wrong. Reading through other user reviews, it seems De'Longhi has a solid reputation for resolving issues promptly.

**Positive Features**

* The sleek and compact design fits neatly into smaller kitchens.
* Produces rich, caf√©-quality espresso with a consistent crema.
* The manual milk frother creates creamy froth for cappuccinos and lattes.
* Quick heat-up time and straightforward operation.
* Robust stainless steel boiler ensures long-lasting performance.

**Areas for Improvement**

* The drip tray feels a bit unstable during brewing.
* Noise levels might be slightly disruptive for some users.
* Requires manual stopping during brewing, which may not suit everyone.
* Steam wand cleaning could be more user-friendly.

**Direct Competitors**

When comparing the De'Longhi EC260BK to other manual espresso machines like the Breville Bambino Plus and the Gaggia Classic Pro, there are notable differences. The Breville Bambino Plus offers automatic milk frothing, which is a boon for beginners, but it comes at a higher price point. The Gaggia Classic Pro is known for its professional-grade steaming capabilities, making it ideal for advanced users, but its larger size doesn‚Äôt suit smaller kitchens. The Stilosa strikes a balance with its compact design, accessible price, and reliable performance, although it doesn‚Äôt offer the same premium features as its pricier competitors.

**Smart Spending**

For its price point, the De'Longhi EC260BK delivers exceptional value. While it lacks some advanced features found in higher-end machines, the quality of coffee it produces makes it worth the investment. I‚Äôd recommend it to anyone starting their espresso journey or looking for an affordable yet reliable manual espresso machine.

Brews coffee but (i) not enough beans are being ground and (ii) puck not being pushed into bin. The grind motor slows down towards end of grind & the piston sounds quite weak. The pump is also noisy. Have completely dismantled the machine & greased and cleaned brew unit.,"Hi all,

First time post on what looks like a fab forum :)

**TLDR version: Please help diagnose the issue with an old Saeco Intuita which does grind & brew coffee \*but\* the puck is smaller than it should be and stays in the brew unit (it doesn't get pushed into the waste bin). The coffee is also too weak. What could be causing this? I have (i) thoroughly cleaned & greased the brew unit, (ii) thoroughly cleaned inside the machine, & (iii) removed the grinder unit & opened up the burrs and cleaned them out. None of this makes any difference.** 

**Any idea what the next step should be?**

**LONG VERSION:**

**Introduction:**

A relative has a more than ten year old Saco Intuita which has developed some problems and I'd like to fix it for them (I know it's an old machine, but they like it!). I'm quite familiar with repairing the Delonghi Magnifica & Magnifica S series machines but this is a new machine for me to learn about. The owner did descale it occasionally but barely cleaned it, so it was extremely filthy inside (including a spider's web on the boiler) and loads of old encrusted coffee around the brew unit.  The machine was, however, quite clean inside the parts that aren't supposed to ever have coffee in them (e.g. around the thermoblock & around the outside of the grinder unit).

**The issues:**

\- The machine does grind coffee & brew it, with a normal amount of coffee liquid coming out of the spout. However, it is quite weak coffee and the puck (which seems much smaller than it should be) stays in the brew unit and doesn't fall into the bin.    
\- The amount of coffee being ground seems very reduced and the coffee seems quite weak.  
\- The grinding motor seems to slow down a bit towards the end of the grind & the piston noise when the coffee is being compressed and then pushed out seems to slow down a bit towards the end and sounds like it's running of power. However, perhaps this is normal for a Saeco (I'm used to the Delonghis which maintain consistent grind & piston sounds throughout their brewing process). The owner says he thinks it doesn't sound that different to how it used to sound, but he wasn't very certain.  
\- The pump does sound quite noisy (I will try running a decalfication when I get a chance, but given that a normal amount of water is coming through, I think it's unliikely this is the main issue). I also didn't see any signs of limescale in the tubes.

**What has been tried:**

\- The big orange rubber ring inside the brew unit has been replaced with a new part.

\- I've completely dismantled and cleaned and greased the brew unit, using the incredibly helpful ""Coffee Genius"" guide. I'm fairly confident there is no issue with the brew unit (although I did notice the flap that I think pushes the coffee into the bin was at a slight angle, but I think that is by design).

\- I've taken all the covers off and thoroughly cleaned inside the machine and all the removable parts to wash off all the old encrusted coffee. It now looks pretty clean inside.

\- I've removed the grinder unit & removed the upper burr and cleaned completely inside the burrs. The grind motor was very clean looking and didn't seem to have been contaminated with coffee and the burr grinding surfaces looked OK once I'd cleaned them. I didn't get time to check the large white gear underneath the grinder so perhaps that could be damaged (but it seemed to have lubricant inside)?

**Next Steps**

\- Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this issue? It's a fairly specific problem so perhaps there is an easy solution (a software setting / forced recalibration perhaps)?

\- Alternatively, perhaps the piston motor or grind motor/cog have worn out and need replacing?

\- I wanted to try running diagnostic tests but ran out of time. I also didn't take pictures (I was pretty confident that cleaning & greasing the brew unit would solve the problem) so next time I get a chance to look at the machine, I'll try to take some pics.

Thanks!!!!

1ixh9gk,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ixh9gk/my_25f_boyfriend_28m_went_from_caring_sweetheart/,"My (25F) boyfriend (28M) went from caring sweetheart to cold, emotionless robot overnight","Hi everyone, I know this might not be the most exciting of stories but I am extremely confused and upset so any advice you may be able to offer me would be very much appreciated! I'll try to keep this as short as I can, while giving enough info for you to hopefully have some insight into what's going on in his head! For the very short version see TLDR at the bottom!

My bf and I have been together for about a year and a half, and so far it's been a great relationship. He's sweet and loving and level-headed, we don't get into fights and we've always managed to comunicate well and resolve any small issues we do have very quickly. He's always spoken as though he values open and honest communication a lot, and right up until the past few days I've felt like we both have been pretty good at that.

I've been struggling with my mental health the past couple of months because of upcoming exams, family problems, grief, and some physical health problems. Bf's been really caring and supportive, and I've been trying my best to minimise the effect of my mental health on him. Everything seems to have been totally fine and good between us until suddenly it wasn't. He was a bit grumpy with me one morning, so I asked him if I'd done something to upset him. He said he was just stressed with work, but also that he knows I'm going through a lot but sometimes he finds he struggles a bit with my mental health as well. I apologised and said I understood, admitted I have probably been relying too much on him for support and said I would tone it down. I suggested we try having a bit more time apart (we usually spend 5 nights a week together), and asked if he thought that might help? He said he would think about it but wanted it to be a joint decision by both of us. He was very lovely and reassuring during this conversation, saying (unprompted) that he didn't have any doubts at all about the relationship and that he wanted me to talk to him about things, he just gets a bit overwhelmed sometimes and needs to recharge. Then we had a really nice rest of the day together. As we were going to bed I asked if I was staying at his the next night or if we wanted to take the day apart, he stood and thought about it for ages and then said 'yeah you can stay if you want'. That was kind of off so I took it to mean he wanted the day apart, but was worried it would be hurtful to say so?

The next day (yesterday) he messaged to ask if I was coming back to his after I was done studying, I said no, I would be going home, he said okay. I then didn't hear from him for the rest of the day, not even to say goodnight. I barely slept because I was afraid that he was really angry with me for something or even that something had happened to him because he had never not said goodnight to me before. Then in the morning I got this message:

""Morning, things have been really tough lately and I'm feeling quite overwhelmed with it all. I need a little time to sort out my thoughts and get myself together. I care about you but I need a week to process everything as I'm struggling a lot. I hope you understand xx""

That felt really weird and formal compared to how he usually speaks to me, and the suddenly wanting a whole week apart and needing 'time to sort out his thoughts' was just so out of the blue and sounded like break up words, so I called him to see what was going on, and it was like talking to a robot. He was just giving me short answers in this really cold, emotionless tone. When I tried to figure out what was going on, he said I'd been off with him recently and it was making him feel really anxious and like I was mad at him. I apologised and explained that I haven't been mad at him, just struggling mentally and finding it hard to be upbeat and chatty all the time. He just said 'okay'. I asked if we could talk this through and he said he just wants time and to wait for 'the anxiety to just go away'. I asked if he's breaking up with me and he said 'obviously I'm not breaking up with you'. I asked if he loves me and he said 'yeah'. I asked if we could still talk during this time apart and he said 'sure, yeah'. I asked him if possible could he message me occasionally to tell me he loves me, because this situation is making me feel really scared, and he said 'yeah, okay. I do love you'. The whole time he never changed his totally indifferent tone, even when I was crying. He's never spoken to me like that before and it made me feel so small and uncared for. It's like I was talking to a completely dfferent person, it sounded like all his love and care for me had completey vanished overnight. That call only lasted 15 mins and happened at about 9:30am, it's now midnight and I haven't heard a word from him since.

So now I've found myself in this situation where he has disappeared out of nowhere and made it clear he doesn't want to talk to me, I don't know what's going on in his head or if he's going to break up with me, and I just have to sit with this anxiety and fear for however long until he decides he wants to speak to me again? I just started my study leave for my upcoming exams (they start next week), and I'm so upset and anxious that it literally took me all day to read 2 pages of a textbook.

So my question is how do I approach this situation? Do I try to ask him to meet for coffee or something and talk? Do I just try to get on with life and leave him alone until he decides to talk to me? Is it okay to text him good morning/good night messages and/or general 'how was your day' stuff or is any communication gonna be seen as me smothering him? Even if we do talk and he doesn't break up with me, how do I even address how this has made me feel? I feel really confused and hurt, and this couldn't have come at a worse time for me, but now I'm worried about how he might react if I try to have that conversation with him. I feel guilty because it seems like I must have been really upsetting him with my mental stuff, but also a part of me wonders if anything maybe I actually haven't been open enough about it, because surely if he knew how bad I was feeling he wouldn't be doing this?

TLDR: I have been struggling with mental health and exams, and boyfriend has been very supportive. He has always been caring and mature, and I've always felt secure with him until now. He suddenly became cold and distant and said he needs a week away from me, when pushed he said it's because I make him anxious. When I tried to talk it through with him he just gave short, indifferent answers, and said he just wants time to wait for the 'anxiety to just go away'. I'm left feeling blindsided and afraid of what this means for our relationship.

Please keep in mind that these are entirely optional. I'm still going to do my best to keep pushing out new comics and other artwork regardless of my financial situation.

In all honesty, though, just having interaction with my content is so much more than I can ask for. It's an amazing privilege to create art that gets seen by so many different people. I'm always grateful when my art receives likes, shares, and comments. I feel incredibly humbled whenever someone messages me or replies that my comics resonated with them. All of this keeps me motivated to create more art.

Thank you for your ongoing support!

I‚Äôve got a situation where I‚Äôm not really sure if I‚Äôm exhibiting self-love or something else. Long story short, a girl from uni suggested we should go for a coffee sometime. I never knew if it was meant romantically or friendly. Anyway, there were weeks apart in response time from her end. She rescheduled and cancelled 3 times, I I didn‚Äôt mind. After her last cancellation she stopped responding altogether. I kept seeing her at uni, we talked, but she didn‚Äôt mention anything. 

A few days later I heard she went on a date with a guy. I thought alright, this is an effort/personal thing on her side. Nonetheless the reason, I didn‚Äôt really take her serious anymore ( I did feel a bit hurt by it). I don‚Äôt have a lot of respect for people who come up with plans and ghost afterwards. So I figured I‚Äôd just keep it short when I see her and just say Hi how are you and move on. That went quite well, until..




Last week she saw me in the library and she came up to me to say hi and have a conversation. I got carried away, and we had a long conversation, but I messaged her the day afterwards. I told her I‚Äôve been meaning to keep our interactions short (also apologized for giving the wrong idea the day before) and explained her how making plans with me but not following up came across as inconsiderate.

She told me that she understood but it didn‚Äôt l cross her mind that ‚ÄúI would take it that way‚Äù and was hurted by the fact I wanted to cut our interactions for something ‚Äúso small‚Äù. I gave my 
reply, she hasn‚Äôt responded yet and saw her again at uni today. I‚Äôve been feeling so mean about it, i missed talking to her, and I get the feeling that I‚Äôm exaggerating and magnifying it. I can‚Äôt tell if this is my low standard self talking or if I‚Äôm seeing this in black and white and holding a grudge.

He's in med school so i know he doesn't have an income at the moment, so when he does come to visit, I'll pay for a few things and always ask if he wants me to split the bill because I do appreciate the fact that he's coming to see me and taking time off from studying. We ended up going out for lunch and he paid for my coffee and bagel.
Nick also introduced me to his cousin when he came to visit and we went out to dinner together (me, nick, nicks cousin, cousins girlfriend, cousins friend, and another couple) at the end of dinner, the cousin paid for the entire thing and l assumed he would just venmo request both (me & nicks) meal to nick. The next day, I introduced nick to one of my friends and we went out to dinner, and since nick had ordered a plate of some sort of meat and my friend is a vegetarian, I wasn't going to make her pay for his plate. When the check came, my friend and I fought a bit about who was paying meanwhile nick was quiet. I ended up paying the check which I didn't think was a huge deal because I assumed nick had paid for my dinner last night with his cousin. The next day, nick called out of work at hospital he's studying at and moved his train ticket costing him extra money because he wanted to stay a day longer with me, so we went out for pizza.

1ixh1s1,https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian/comments/1ixh1s1/im_having_a_strange_experience_with_christians/,I'm having a strange experience with 'Christians' right now.,"I have two, let's call them friends. Both of them used to run a ministry together. Let's call them Pastor A and Pastor B. 

They no longer run this together. 

Pastor A through his own naivety, pride, and godlike controlling behaviour has made a series of decisions, that have no resulted in him losing the ministry, losing his home, losing his job, losing all of his money by putting faith into God, and people coming along saying 'Hey I'm a Christian too, invest all of your money into my 'scam' business 'pyrimind' schemes. And he'll keep doing this, believe these are people sent from God. 
Now no one trusts his discernment, he's now living in the room of his wife's mothers home. He doesn't believe in contraception and thinks each child is a God's will. And so his wife, himself and their 7 children are now sleeping in one bed. In a room. 

This pastor A is very strong willed, holier than thou, you must follow the 10 commandments. Do it or go to hell. Music not mentioning the man reffered to as jesus as demonic, movies that do not have this man jesus within it demonic, coffee is demonic. And he preaches that we must fear God, over and over. He also says he is a perfect man and does not sin. 

Pastor B is very humble, has never had a wife, or even a girlfriend, lives alone. And doesn't really have the same interpretation as Pastor A. Pastor A never really noticed this, because Pastor A likes the sound of his own voice. 

But Pastor B, believes that this is all just spirituality, and that this 'law', is a spiritual law, that has been written on the hearts and minds of people. And this 'body' of Christ, doesn't fall under people the label themselves with the name 'Christians'. He believes the bible isn't the word of God. And the 'word' is the spirit of life itself. Kind of like how paul talks about how he has to come to the Jews as a jew, the weak as weak, those under the law as under the law, those under the law of christ as under the law of Christ etc. And how Paul found that gentiles, that had never read the torah, had this spiritual law already in their hearts. He also believes that the kingdom is within us, (a state of mind), and that hell is also a (state of mind). Anything referencing 'stone' is reference to this law written on stone. That Paul says we died to, and then were resurrected in the spirit, to the spiritual law, and how once you have that mindset, the veil is lifted when reading the old testiment, as Paul writes about. 

I agree with everything Pastor B says. We resonate with each other, and we also both like to explore other spiritual books and ideas. There's a problem, he lives in this community where all of the people around him have this controlling Christian behavior. These people now seem to have some problem, not with only him, but with me? They somehow thing I have possessed him? And even claimed at one point I had hacked his phone. (Pastor A) made this claim. 

Pastor B has simply been posting scripture such as. 

Romans 9:3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed from Christ for the sake of my brethren, my kinsmen according to the flesh. (with a caption 'why would Paul say this?)

And 

Numbers 15:32-36
32 Now while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found a man gathering sticks on the Sabbath day. 33 And those who found him gathering sticks brought him to Moses and Aaron, and to all the congregation. 34 They put him under guard, because it had not been explained what should be done to him.

35 Then the Lord said to Moses, ‚ÄúThe man must surely be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.‚Äù 36 So, as the Lord commanded Moses, all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones, and he died.

(with the caption 'Happy Sabbath' üôè) 

And 

'Love the Lord Thyself with all Thy mind heart and soul' 

Pastor A, and a group of others seem to be acting like Pharisees now. Watching us very closely, wanting to know what it is Pastor B is doing. And called pastor B, r-tar-ed, an attention seeker, pathetic. Claimed that he is a child of the devil, and demonic?

Pastor A also didn't the idea of us creating a statue in which we wrote upon the statue that we 'Forgive God üôè'. 

Pastor A then did a sermon on a live stream talking about pastor B in a passive aggressive manner. 

He then sent pastor B a text message that said 'I have all of these problems', and described his current situation, that he was in where he now doesn't even have funds to feed his family. And that he still has not given up on God through all of these trials and pastor B has no one to take care of but himself, therefore pastor B is just sad and lonely and feeling sorry for himself'??? 

Anyway, after pastor B showed me this message, I went through a battle between my ego and my spirit/higherself. And my mind could not rest. 

So I sent pastor A who I had not spoken to in a while myself, a $300 gift card, along with a video on YouTube of a brother and sister covering the song by avicii called 'Hey brother' 
https://youtu.be/IC9HiG5Z-Sg?si=ClXT1BKQt30O8tiw


He said he was very grateful and now he is able to feed his family in the coming weeks. And he was grateful that I considered him as a brother. Then he listened to avicii, and said that he was surprised he'd never heard of this song before. 

I explained to him that this spirit inside me would not rest unless I gave the money to him. 

I then told him about the time I cursed God, and I committed all kinds of sins intentionally to try and get a reaction from God. I told God to take me down now and take me to hell. And the only response I received, was my own spirit/mind patting me on the head and asking 'are you finished yet?' 

And how after that I felt so guilty for doing so. But I asked God then why are you causing so much suffering in the world. Then my spirit told me 'if I am to forgive you, have mercy on you, justify your actions rather than judge, then why do you judge me?' 

And I asked this pastor also why is it that myself as a sinner, am given so much compassion and mercy from God, have abundance coming to me whilst living such a carefree lifestyle, and I have been given the privilege to have all this time of rest that I can really connect with the spirit. But him a law keeping upright man, is being made to fear and keeps having his life getting worse and worse, and seems very chaotic. 

He told me he would call me the next day to explain this. He never did actually call me. 

But I saw that he then began to post things on his scripture about how important it is to love one another. And love messages. Which is strange. And that all commandments fall under 'love your neighbour as yourself'. Because all he ever usually does is preach fear. 

Hmm... Does anyone have any insight they can add...

1ixh1nl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1ixh1nl/unappreciative_wife_what_do_i_do/,"Unappreciative wife, what do I do","Been married for 14 years, and known my wife for 17. Had worries about her before marrying, but told myself it would work out. 

We've had arguments all through the relationship, she's withheld sex and said it's because I haven't bought her flowers or made her feel loved. I've done all kinds of things such as ¬£¬£¬£ meals, messages, flowers, been kind, but nope she only has sex when she wants it. When she read 50 shades did way more than 50 bunches of flowers.

There's been a few times she's threatened to kill herself or take pills etc because I apparently make her so angry. I used to try to stop her, she's hit me with all her strength and also threatened me with a knife. One night she went to the kitchen and broke every bit of crockery she could find, it was awful. She finally went out to find a hotel (she didn't in the end) and I was able to clean it all up before the kids woke up.

It's not usually that bad, so I've put up with it for the sake of the kids. She's never threatened them and is a pretty good mum. And whatever she does I'd take it to keep the family together. I love my kids more than life, and my feeling is that since she's a good mum and loves the kids, and losing her or me would be devastating to them, we need to stick together. 

But I don't know what to do for myself. I was emotionally and physically abused as a kid, and that was way worse than anything my wife has ever done. She knows all about that and knows that if she yells at me my defence is to go silent or leave the room or walk away. But she follows me and keeps going. 

I am overall a pretty happy guy, and even have fun with my wife and enjoy her company. We have coffee together most mornings and discuss life and how we can work well. But often she just picks up on tiny things and makes them bigger and bigger. 

Example, I recently just paid for a holiday for us and her parents to go skiing. Happy to do it, the kids love their grandparents and it's good to see them. But wife was yelling at me for not taking out the garbage when it was full. No mention of making breakfasts for kids, or getting them dressed, or providing financially. Just a focus on what I didn't do (I literally wasn't aware). 

She doesn't work, and hasn't since she got pregnant with our oldest, now 10. Sex life is non existent. She does housework but constantly reminds me everything she's done. I run a business that is relatively successful, and can operate it in 4 hours per day, so she expects me to do a lot of housework and taking care of the kids.

She's always nagging at me that I don't do anything which is completely untrue, I make some of the meals, go shopping etc. She does laundry and cleaning and generally manages the household.

TLDR: wife is nagging and doesn't appreciate me and is occasionally very angry and borderline abusive. I don't want to leave her because we have 3 amazing happy kids and think they would be devastated.

1ixgx8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ixgx8l/am_i_overreacting_about_my_friend/,Am I Overreacting About My Friend?,"I don‚Äôt know if I have a real friend or if I‚Äôm just being too sensitive.

I met this girl, let‚Äôs call her Deb, through a book club organized by a mutual friend. We became really close, texting and calling to vent to each other. At our weekly book club meetings, we always sat together. I don‚Äôt have a lot of friends since I‚Äôve moved around a lot for my husband‚Äôs work, so I really felt like I had finally found a friend. But lately, I‚Äôve been feeling weird about our friendship. I keep wondering: Am I seeing red flags, or am I overreacting?

The Odd Things That Bother Me:

She‚Äôd say things like, ‚ÄúWe should totally do lunch!‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to a winery soon!‚Äù‚Äîbut it never actually happened. One time, she even offered, out loud, in front of our whole book club, to watch my kids while I run errands. She has never even met my kids. It felt like she was just performing kindness for an audience.

Then there was this really uncomfortable moment that made me feel uneasy.

We were the first to arrive at book club one night. Deb was on the phone and suddenly put it on speaker. It was the organizer of the club ( our mutual friend) venting about how one of the girls only comes for the wine.

Deb didn‚Äôt tell her she was on speaker. Didn‚Äôt mention that I was standing right there, listening to everything. I excused myself. 

Like‚Ä¶ if she‚Äôs comfortable letting someone unknowingly vent in front of me, what does she do when I‚Äôm the one talking?

What makes it even more confusing is my mutual friend, the one who invited me to the book club in the first place. Her and I are somewhat close, we met through our kids‚Äô soccer team. She‚Äôs incredibly busy (she has four little ones), so we don‚Äôt connect much outside of the occasional playdates and soccer matches. But when I asked her how long she and Deb had known each other, she immediately started singing her praises. She told me Deb was amazing, that everyone at church adored her, and that if Deb weren‚Äôt always so busy, she‚Äôd love to organize a group trip. As if the group couldn‚Äôt go without her?

The Rumor That Made Everything WorseThen something happened that completely threw me off: 

Deb went on a coffee date with another girl from the club, let‚Äôs call her Linda. That was already weird because, in all the time we‚Äôve known each other ( 6 months at this point), Deb and I had never gone for coffee like that. In fact, we didn‚Äôt do anything like that. 

Afterward, Deb immediately called me. She told me how Linda said the book club thinks we don‚Äôt like each other. Deb was outraged and said she immediately shut it down. Then she went on and on about how weird the coffee date was and how weird Linda was.

And while she was talking, all I could think was:

‚Ä¢ Why would anyone think we don‚Äôt like each other? We‚Äôve never given that impression.

‚Ä¢ Why was our friendship even being discussed?

‚Ä¢ How did that even come up?

‚Ä¢ And why did Linda feel comfortable telling Deb this instead of me?

It felt off, but I just thanked her for standing up for me.

Then, a week later, I asked Deb if she wanted to grab lunch. And guess what she said? She couldn‚Äôt because she had plans with Linda to go to a bakery.

Linda. The same girl she just told me was weird. The same girl who was supposedly spreading rumors about us.

I didn‚Äôt say anything in the moment. I was too stunned. Deb hugged me and said, ‚ÄúSee you next week!‚Äù like nothing had happened.

The next day, I couldn‚Äôt shake it. I called her and straight up asked why she went out with Linda after what she told me. Her response?  ‚ÄúJust because someone is weird doesn‚Äôt mean I can‚Äôt hang out with them.‚Äù

Then she casually mentioned that Linda was curious about how Deb had so many friends and wanted her help meeting more people. And then, this is the part that really stung, she said: ‚ÄúMaybe you would have more friends if you opened up more.‚Äù And then, right before hanging up, she added: ‚ÄúI gotta go, I‚Äôm getting my nails done with the book club girls. Talk soon!‚Äù And I just‚Ä¶ shut down.

I‚Äôm in this book club. No one invited me. No one even mentioned it, not Deb or my mutual friend. Deb didn‚Äôt even ask why I wasn‚Äôt there. I felt like I wasn‚Äôt even part of the group.

Now I Don‚Äôt Know What to Think.

I told my husband, and he didn‚Äôt hesitate. He said, ‚ÄúPeople like Deb aren‚Äôt anyone‚Äôs friends.‚Äù

I kind of want to drop out of the book club. It‚Äôs making me feel lonely. I joined hoping to make genuine friendships, but now I just feel like an outsider watching everyone else bond while I‚Äôm left out.

I don‚Äôt even know if Deb is intentionally being hurtful or if this is just how she is with everyone. But either way, it doesn‚Äôt feel good. I feel like I‚Äôm forcing a friendship with someone who wouldn‚Äôt even notice if I stopped showing up.

Would I be overreacting if I just stopped going? Or should I try to push through and make new connections?

1ixgwqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1ixgwqf/my_gf_just_broke_up_with_me_after_10_years/,My GF just broke up with me after 10 years,"I‚Äôve been with my girlfriend for 10 years. We have an apartment together, we love each other. Sometimes she would complain that I didn‚Äôt spend enough time with her, that we didn‚Äôt have enough intimacy, that I didn‚Äôt show enough interest in her. But we loved each other, and we spent a lot of good times together. We‚Äôve shared so many wonderful moments.

I went abroad for a month, and she also spent two weeks in a training camp. I came back on Friday, and she came back this morning.

When she was abroad, we had a 4-hour time difference, and she was training a lot (training camp). We couldn‚Äôt find time to talk‚Ä¶ this frustrated me, and I said some hurtful things to provoke a reaction. But she took the opportunity to play my game and announced that she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me for a week. I managed to get her on the phone, I kept pushing her, and she broke up with me‚Äîpromising not to sleep with other guys and that we could talk when she returned.

Her issue is that I haven‚Äôt changed enough in 10 years, and she doesn‚Äôt believe I can change now.

She ignored me mostly this week, and when she did talk to me, she was cold. I‚Äôve never seen her like this.

When she came back, I went to pick her up at the airport. I pulled out all the stops: a bouquet of flowers, coffee (she was tired), and a taxi ride home. At the apartment, I had several gifts planned, including letters on cards (we used to write love notes) and a piece of jewelry I got abroad (it‚Äôs two half-hearts with our names engraved).

She felt pain as soon as she saw me. She didn‚Äôt want me to come because she knew it would make things harder. We took the taxi home, and that‚Äôs when I hit a wall. She was very serious, physically unwell (but not crying), though we still touched. When we got to the apartment, she told me that she wanted to rebuild herself, that she felt trapped in a relationship that wasn‚Äôt fulfilling her projects. That‚Äôs when I broke down. I told her I understood and promised I would change in all the areas she mentioned. She didn‚Äôt believe me because, after 10 years, why would I change now? She gave me a whole list of things that were hard for me to understand: we are soulmates, meaning we can reconnect (she even mentioned maybe in a year and a half); she needs time to rebuild; she‚Äôs going to stay at a friend‚Äôs place for an indefinite period; that I have little chance of getting her back (she gave me a 5% chance). Everything started to feel even harder. Still, she said she loves me and wants us to meet on Saturday for a ""check-in."" She took my gifts with her (except the bouquet, which was too bulky) and seemed clearly upset. She acknowledged the effort in the apartment and the attentions.

Later, a friend of mine came to see me. His wife had spoken to my (ex)-girlfriend on the phone. She explained that they had talked the day before her return to France, where my (ex)-girlfriend told her the exact same reasons for what was happening. Where she suffers is that she feels guilty for making me suffer. She called herself a ‚Äúb\*tch.‚Äù Immediately, I called her. She answered in tears. I told her she didn‚Äôt have to call herself that. I reiterated my intentions with her, but I don‚Äôt want her pity. I canceled our Saturday meeting. I told her that we wouldn‚Äôt meet again until she feels in her heart that she can project herself with me again. She agreed. She asked if she could check in with me daily to see how I‚Äôm doing. I refused because I see that as pity. I want her to think about our future. So, I imposed a rule on myself‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs really hard‚Äînot to talk to her and let her come back to me on her own.

She‚Äôs an amazing girl‚Äîextraordinary, kind, and adorable, with values that are very similar to mine. The hardest part is yet to come because I have to get through this week while I‚Äôm consumed by this abyssal emptiness. My mind is clouded by all the mistakes I made despite the warnings. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to make it without contacting her at the end of the week to ask where she stands. Do you think that‚Äôs a good solution? The worst part will come if she doesn‚Äôt change her mind. She‚Äôll come sleep at the apartment for a while, then pick up her things.

I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts on this situation, as it‚Äôs making me suffer terribly.

1ixgux9,https://www.reddit.com/r/redscarepod/comments/1ixgux9/the_internets_favorite_sex_researcher_how_aella/,THE INTERNET‚ÄôS FAVORITE SEX RESEARCHER: How Aella went from selling sex to studying it,"(The Atlantic) Over the course of 2024, Aella cried on 71 different days, showered on 24, and took ketamine on 14. We know this because she meticulously gathers and posts information about people‚Äôs personal, emotional, and sexual lives‚Äîincluding her own. The crying number was unusually high, she says, because of a bad breakup. For many fans, the more boggling statistic was that last year, she had sex on only 41 days, but on one of those days, she had sex with nearly 40 people. We‚Äôll come back to that.

After years of following Aella‚Äôs online outrages and unexpected insights, I wanted to meet her for myself‚Äîto understand her unusual occupation as a cam girl turned sex researcher, and to hear her perspective on what the internet has done to human sexuality. But my first IRL encounter with her, one day last spring, involved staring at a closed front door.

Aella had invited me to her home in Austin, but then slept through our designated appointment time. Even my frantic knocking and texting didn‚Äôt rouse her. Eventually, though, once she had woken up and been for a swim in the local springs, her assistant let me into the house and made me a mushroom coffee. Explaining that she was gradually bringing order to Aella‚Äôs life, the assistant opened a closet to reveal a rail of neatly hung bras. This was a first in my journalism career‚Äîbeing invited to appreciate an interviewee‚Äôs underwear. Not that Aella would mind, because her entire appeal is based around her lack of filter. Polaroids of her, masked and topless, were stuck to the fridge.

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt really get canceled,‚Äù she told me when I finally met her, ‚Äúbecause what are you gonna do?‚Äù By then she was sitting with her legs curled up underneath her on a chair, wearing only a robe and underwear, next to a giant, curved monitor of the type beloved by crypto day traders.

Aella is her longtime pseudonym; the 33-year-old keeps her birth name private. Describing precisely what she does for a living is difficult: Her X bio describes her as a ‚Äúwhorelord‚Äù and a ‚Äúvexworker,‚Äù by which she means that she is an OnlyFans star, occasional escort, and organizer of sex parties. She is unabashedly a nerd, once describing herself as ‚Äúa gremlinesque neckbeard who found himself in a hot woman‚Äôs body.‚Äù And she has turned her experience of selling sex into a large-scale research project.

Thanks to her talent for virality, she has been able to create huge online surveys that, despite the limitations of the medium, provide some of the broadest insights that we have into sexuality in the 2020s. More than 700,000 people have responded to her ‚ÄúBig Kink‚Äù survey. She has learned, among other things, that ‚Äúpigtails‚Äù are a more popular fetish than ‚Äúarmpits.‚Äù She is as uninhibited about asking inflammatory questions as she is about posting nudes: She has written about whether penis size is correlated with race (‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt had a good, high-n study‚Äù) and asked her followers if they would support the creation of realistic child-size sex dolls for pedophiles (77.4 percent said no).

One of the biggest problems in sex research is recruiting participants who can be induced to answer questions honestly. This is where Aella‚Äôs experience of capturing the internet‚Äôs attention gives her an advantage. The Big Kink survey takes about 40 minutes to complete‚Äîlong enough to weed out trollish and spam responses. But how could she expect to keep unpaid respondents interested for that long? Her solution was to promise them a freakiness rating at the end, like a classic BuzzFeed personality quiz.

Justin Garcia, an evolutionary biologist who serves as the executive director of the Kinsey Institute at Indiana University, sees Aella as the young-Millennial version of Dr. Ruth Westheimer, the sex educator whose grandmotherly charm made her a disarming advocate of sexual liberation. As Dr. Ruth understood, many Americans‚Äô lives were once blighted by their inability to articulate, much less confront, their relationship needs. Even today, people withhold details about their sexual interests from their partners, their doctors, and academic researchers. Yet they‚Äôll spill quite a lot to a sex-positive internet personality, and all those revelations add up to a huge body of information.

Like much American social-science research, Aella‚Äôs sample skews white and college-educated. Liberals are overrepresented in her data; most of her followers are men, but most of her survey respondents are women. Online polls like hers have limitations, Garcia told me. ‚ÄúBut,‚Äù he added, ‚Äúthey do tell us what people are thinking about.‚Äù

Aella was raised in Idaho in a fundamentalist-Christian family that was so socially conservative, her parents showed her and her two younger sisters a censored version of Titanic. Her father is an evangelist and a radio host who used to be flooded by hate mail from atheists and other Christians. That turned out to be a preview of Aella‚Äôs own experience of threats and abuse, and good practice for life online. On a recent seven-and-a-half-hour episode of the podcast Whatever, she was part of a panel of 10 women who were hectored and mocked by Andrew Wilson, a fellow guest and self-described Christian ‚Äúbloodsports debater.‚Äù When he insinuated that she didn‚Äôt understand science, she kept her cool and calmly explained basic statistical methods to him. His argumentative tactics, she said afterward, reminded her of her father‚Äôs.

She always felt like an outsider, she says now. She remembers writing in her teenage journals that ‚Äúeverybody else has access to a secret script that I don‚Äôt know what it is.‚Äù She left home at 17 after an argument. Once she started seeing flaws in her Christian beliefs, her faith crumbled quickly. ‚ÄúI have a tendency to take things to an extreme,‚Äù Aella once told Playboy. She flipped from devout teenager to libertine 20-something, barely passing through the dull span of vanilla dating and low-key Sunday churchgoing.

After dropping out of college in northern Idaho, Aella became a cam girl‚Äîbecause streaming explicit content for money couldn‚Äôt be worse than her day job on an electrical-equipment assembly line, she reckoned. She both enjoyed and excelled at it, and she soon started researching what made some girls more successful than others. Her findings surprised her: Viewers liked idiosyncrasy and theatricality as much as nudity and straightforward hotness. And so she began to stage surreal scenes‚Äîdressing up as a mime, pretending to seduce a chair, doing a ‚Äúdinosaur moonwalk,‚Äù playing the accordion. On an internet filled with horny nerds, the juxtaposition of weird and sexy can be lucrative. She earned more than $100,000 in her best month on OnlyFans, and has thousands of paid subscribers on Substack.

Her first moment of virality outside the camming sites came in 2013, from a series of photos that showed her undressing, before being dragged off camera by garden gnomes. The ‚ÄúGetting Gnaked‚Äù set was viewed more than 2 million times within a year. Aella also found that, contrary to many of the stereotypes about online porn, a physically submissive woman was not what most straight men wantedj. Instead, her customers fantasized about scenarios in which they were essentially passive‚Äîa ‚Äúbasic hot girl‚Äù just fell into their arms. ‚ÄúLike, Oh, we‚Äôre the last people on Earth, right?‚Äù she told the podcaster Lex Fridman. In a conclusion that might unsettle some feminists, she finds that the proportion of women who are interested in feeling submissive is greater than the proportion of men who want to feel dominant. Perhaps my favorite Aella claim is that she can arouse her escorting clients just by expressing enthusiasm as they explain high-level concepts to her. (Her current rate is $4,000 an hour.)

During her early career, she bounced around the U.S., living in Boston, New York, and the Bay Area, as well as Portland, Oregon. She gravitated toward a scene known as rationalism, wherein self-professed nerds apply a coldly rational lens to subjects that are often clouded by emotion or dogma, such as the heritability of intelligence, whether you should altruistically donate a kidney to a stranger, and whether it‚Äôs acceptable to have sex with your sister. ‚Äúonce i threw a party for the bay area rationalists, and the rules to attend were you had to be wearing a full-face coverage mask, and be naked,‚Äù she wrote on X in 2021, during the pandemic. ‚ÄúMany came; they all bravely stripped, donned weird masks ‚Ä¶ and then proceeded to sit in a polite circle and debate global trade.‚Äù Her bracingly unfiltered posts put her in my peripheral vision years ago; while I am worried about the potential for abuse and exploitation in sex work, her originality and openness have always intrigued me.

Last February, somewhat infamously, she enrolled 42 men to have sex with her en masse via a Google Form, then rented a venue, recruited eight women to act as fluffers, and asked the men to put on matching commemorative bathrobes. The resulting Substack post is a masterpiece, starting with an epigram from Nelson Mandela: ‚ÄúI learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it.‚Äù (She detailed how two of the attendees, waiting in line, bonded over the fact that their start-ups had received support from the same venture-capital fund.) This was how she managed to have sex on so few days last year, but with so many different people. It is also one of many, many incidents in Aella‚Äôs life that most people would regard with awe, horror, or both.

Aella originally felt drawn to sex research because her own sexual interests are outside the mainstream. She practices polyamory and freely discusses her fetish for ‚Äúconsensual nonconsent‚Äù‚Äîwhich is to say, scenarios in which she pretends to be taking part against her will. If she were ‚Äúsuper normie‚Äù about sex, she told me, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think I would have the need to dissect it.‚Äù This places her in the grand tradition of American sex researchers who defied convention in their own personal life and, whether they acknowledged it or not, became advocates for greater sexual permissiveness. Alfred Kinsey, a pioneer in the field in the 1940s and ‚Äô50s, was married to a woman but had sexual relationships with at least one of his male students. The biologist shocked the country with his first book about human sexuality, which claimed that only half the population is exclusively heterosexual throughout adulthood. ‚ÄúI suspect that Kinsey‚Äôs great project originated in the discovery of his own sexual ambiguities,‚Äù the author of a 1972 Atlantic article hypothesized. Kinsey‚Äôs ostensibly objective scholarship was a concealed polemic: He wanted to expand the scope of ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù

In the 1960s, the gynecologist William Masters and and his research partner (and later wife) Virginia Johnson also defied prim scholarly norms by serving as consultants to Playboy, reasoning that the magazine was a good way to reach young men, and they supplied female ‚Äúsurrogates‚Äù‚Äîtherapeutic escorts‚Äîto single men with sexual inhibitions, erectile disorder, and other conditions.

Throughout the 20th century, sex researchers willed themselves to suspend moral judgment. Kinsey had a saying, Justin Garcia told me, that is often quoted at the institute that bears his name: ‚ÄúWe are the recorders and reporters of facts‚Äînot the judges of the behaviors we describe.‚Äù Yet the field still has taboos, just different ones. The feminist commentators Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, whose work is highly influential on university campuses, have argued that pornography is inherently harmful to women. Some of Aella‚Äôs findings challenge that view. She finds that men who watch online porn, rather than being desensitized to what real-life sexual partners want, are better at guessing what women want in bed.

Aella is not familiar with the academic traditions that have shaped modern sex research. When I asked her about Kinsey and Masters and Johnson, she told me that she hadn‚Äôt read their work. This irritates some mainstream researchers: J. Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychology professor who studies sexual orientation and arousal, told me he was ‚Äúannoyed‚Äù by what he saw as her casualness, and denied being merely territorial. ‚ÄúShe hasn‚Äôt bothered to learn things,‚Äù Bailey told me. ‚ÄúSex research is not just asking a few questions to a lot of people. If it were, we would know a lot more than we know.‚Äù

Nonetheless, Bailey said, ‚Äúshe talks about things without worry, and we should all be doing that a lot more.‚Äù He thinks that some mainstream academic sex research has suffered from ‚Äúthe encroachment of ideology,‚Äù becoming queer or feminist activism by other means. (Bailey‚Äôs 2003 book, The Man Who Would Be Queen, which argues that some gender transitions are sexually motivated, prompted some transgender activists to accuse him of research misconduct‚Äîclaims that a subsequent investigation did not substantiate.) Bailey invited Aella to join an email discussion group he runs, and he asked her to promote a survey on sadomasochism that his graduate student was running. If he thought her work was worthless, he said, ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt have asked for the help.‚Äù

Garcia noted that, because sex research is a prime target for political scrutiny, institutions like his take great care with study design, researchers‚Äô conflicts of interests, and gaining approval from review boards. ‚ÄúAella, her work blurs those boundaries,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúBut they were created by a field to protect itself, and add rigor and protection from political attacks.‚Äù

Unconstrained by such concerns, Aella has spelunked through the extremes of modern sexuality. Among them is vore, a rare fetish ‚Äúaround swallowing someone whole or being swallowed whole, typically by a much larger creature,‚Äù as she put it. Researching the phenomenon is tricky. Trying to find, say, 300 people who like vore within the results of a bigger survey would require a huge initial number of respondents. Recruiting participants on a vore forum solves that problem, she has written, even if it does introduce some sampling bias: ‚ÄúMaybe these people are less ashamed about their fetish; maybe they‚Äôre lonelier in real life; maybe they‚Äôre much more into vore than the actual population of people into vore,‚Äù Aella argued. Or, of course, they could be lying.

Still, as Aella and others have shown, the universe of niche sexual interests is enormous. And really, this is the big change that the internet has brought to sexuality itself‚Äînot just the study of it. Anyone who grew up with a latent vore fetish 100 years ago, or even 30, might have gone their whole life without meeting a fellow enthusiast for being swallowed whole. Bailey published research on people who both desire amputees and fantasize about becoming amputees. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wonderful is that, today, people with these weird sexualities find each other online,‚Äù he told me. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs really a heyday for studying unusual phenomena like that.‚Äù

That raises some obvious follow-up questions: What if the internet is not just connecting people with weird sexual interests, but creating them? Should there ever be a time when sex researchers say, Hang on, that‚Äôs far enough?

Aella, who considers herself a libertarian, had come to Austin in the hope of meeting like-minded people, away from the default leftism of the Bay Area. But even in America‚Äôs supposed heterodoxy capital, she felt shunned. She joined an invitation-only society for freethinkers called Based in Austin, but was quickly kicked out of the group by fellow anti-woke warriors. Her offense was to post, in a chat thread about venue suggestions, a recommendation for a space where she had once held an orgy. She also didn‚Äôt last in a support group for OnlyFans creators, because other women‚Äîwho she said were ‚Äúvery, very, like, social justice, very leftist‚Äù‚Äîobjected to her provocative posts.

Aella thinks that America still has a deeply hypocritical attitude to sex. ‚ÄúIt feels like we simultaneously have a culture where we say sexual liberalism is good, but in action, we find reasons to not allow individual expression to happen,‚Äù she told me when I caught up with her again over Zoom, a few months after my visit to Austin. She cited PornHub‚Äôs refusal to host videos of sleep fetishes. But there was a good reason for that policy, I said‚Äîthe trial of Dominique Pelicot and 50 other French men revealed that Pelicot had recruited men to rape his unconscious wife under the pretext that the couple were indulging a consensual fetish about ‚Äúsleeping beauties.‚Äù

My main point of disagreement with Aella is that she has a much sunnier vision of human nature than I do. While some people do like consensual nonconsent, others clearly relish actual violation and sadism in and out of the bedroom. Aella‚Äôs blitheness about the risks of her job‚Äîshe wrote a guide to escorting, in which she describes one client aggressively biting and choking her‚Äîseems to be born from the same off-kilter approach to life that makes her such a good amateur anthropologist. In Austin, I was surprised that she invited me, a total stranger, to meet her at home. Eighteen months earlier, a man had appeared at her door and attempted to kidnap her. (Police later found a garrote at his home, alongside a knife, duct tape, and the names of two other sex workers. The man took a plea deal and is already out of jail.)

Ultimately, she left the Texas capital after a different episode of personal turmoil. She had hoped to have children, only to discover in August that her primary partner wasn‚Äôt interested in starting a family. When she revealed the breakup online, a predictable storm of schadenfreude ensued. For ‚Äúposting publicly about being devastated from a breakup,‚Äù she wrote on X, her reward was ‚Äúpeople laughing how you deserved it.‚Äù

She packed up her belongings and moved back to California. Her new housemate is one of the fluffers from her orgy‚Äîa woman who was also dating Aella‚Äôs boyfriend but broke up with him too, in solidarity. ‚ÄúWe were both dating my ex, and then we‚Äôre both not dating him,‚Äù she told me. With her living arrangements sorted, Aella wants to work on a book and co-author some scientific papers, both of which might allow her to gain the respectability she needs to attract more funding. She might seek out what she calls ‚Äúperformative credentials.‚Äù

In the meantime, though, she still embraces the queasily intimate dynamics of internet celebrity‚Äîan openness that provides rich fodder for cruel armchair psychologists. Isn‚Äôt she just getting back at Daddy? How will she ever find love? I find something endearing about her refusal to be bowed by this kind of jeering. Aella bravely voyages to the frontiers of American sexuality, collecting data on people‚Äôs darkest desires, uncovering the hidden economics of the online sex trade, and refusing‚Äîdespite all the mockery‚Äîto filter herself.",0,1740440872.0,redscarepod,12,0.38,False

She was diagnosed with ADHD at 5 and has been to two different psychiatrists over the years trying to find medication that works for her. Nothing has been totally successful. She is now nine years old. 

She is just chaos. That is the only way I can describe her. She goes from one thing to the next in the blink of an eye. My house is covered in craft projects that were abandoned 10 minutes in. We clean them up at least every other day and then she just starts over. The house is also full of holes in the wall that she has made when she randomly flies off the handle. She also kicked a hole in an $800 coffee table when she was mad. No consequences works for her because she truly doesn‚Äôt care about anything. 

She changes emotions so fast. She can go from happy to angry and back in the blink of an eye and when she is angry, she has no control of her body or words. This takes us to the abuse. She is maybe 30 pounds lighter than me and 6 inches shorter at most. She hit and kicks me as hard as she possibly can when she is angry for literally no reason. My mere existence angers her and she attacks me. She also makes up reasons, like claiming I rolled my eyes or I said something to her when I definitely didn‚Äôt. 

Two weeks ago, she hit me in the head so hard that it made me dizzy and gave me a headache.

She hasn‚Äôt experienced any abuse. I never hit back or act out physically when she hits me. She has had a great life and her dad and I have been trying to get her mental help since she was about 3 years old. We both have bipolar disorder in our families and I really think that is the issue. However, we struggle to get anywhere with doctors on this. The psych just talks to her about not hitting people and has her promise not to do it, which does nothing.

I don‚Äôt want to take her to an in-patient facility, but I will if I have to. However, I don‚Äôt know how this works because I don‚Äôt want her to stay there alone. She fears abandonment because she knows she treats us badly, but just can‚Äôt stop herself. I also know that me staying with her probably isn‚Äôt the best choice since I am the person she abuses.

Has anyone else ever experienced this? What did you do?

We are both 30. We have an apartment together, we love each other. Sometimes she would complain that I didn‚Äôt spend enough time with her, that we didn‚Äôt have enough intimacy (even sex is good when I sleep with her), that I didn‚Äôt show enough interest in her. But we loved each other, and we spent a lot of good times together. We‚Äôve shared so many wonderful moments.

I went abroad for a month, and she also spent two weeks in a training camp. I came back on Friday, and she came back this morning.

When she was abroad, we had a 4-hour time difference, and she was training a lot (training camp). We couldn‚Äôt find time to talk‚Ä¶ this frustrated me, and I said some hurtful things to provoke a reaction. Despite my apologies, she took the opportunity to play my game and announced that she didn‚Äôt want to talk to me for a week. I managed to get her on the phone, I kept pushing her, and she broke up with me‚Äîpromising not to sleep with other guys (also telling me she had no interest) and that we could ""talk"" when she returned.

Her issue is that I haven‚Äôt changed enough in 10 years, and she doesn‚Äôt believe I can change now.

She ignored me mostly this week, and when she did talk to me, she was cold. I‚Äôve never seen her like this.

When she came back, I went to pick her up at the airport. I pulled out all the stops: a bouquet of flowers, coffee (she was tired), and a taxi ride home. At the apartment, I had several gifts planned, including letters on cards (we used to write love notes) and a piece of jewelry I got abroad (it‚Äôs two half-hearts with our names engraved).

She felt pain as soon as she saw me. She didn‚Äôt want me to come because she knew it would make things harder. We took the taxi home, and that‚Äôs when I hit a wall. She was very serious, physically unwell (but not crying), though we still touched each other's hand and thighs. When we got to the apartment, she told me that she wanted to rebuild herself, that she felt trapped in a relationship that wasn‚Äôt fulfilling her projects. That‚Äôs when I broke down. I told her I understood and promised I would change in all the areas she mentioned. She didn‚Äôt believe me because, after 10 years, why would I change now? She gave me a whole list of things that were hard for me to understand: we are soulmates, meaning we can reconnect (she even mentioned maybe in a year and a half); she needs time to rebuild; she‚Äôs going to stay at a friend‚Äôs place for an indefinite period; that I have little chance of getting her back (she gave me a 5% chance). Everything started to feel even harder. Still, she said she loves me and wants us to meet on Saturday for a ""check-in."" She took my gifts with her (except the bouquet, which was too bulky) and seemed clearly upset. She acknowledged the effort in the apartment and the attentions.

Later, a friend of mine came to see me. His wife had spoken to my (ex)-girlfriend on the phone. She explained that they had talked the day before her return home, where my (ex)-girlfriend told her the exact same reasons for what was happening. Where she suffers is that she feels guilty for making me suffer. She called herself a ‚Äúbitch.‚Äù Immediately, I called her. She answered right away in tears (which differs from whe we were apart; then, it was very hard to get in touch with her). I told her she didn‚Äôt have to call herself that. I reiterated my intentions with her, but I don‚Äôt want her pity. I canceled our Saturday meeting. I told her that we wouldn‚Äôt meet again until she feels in her heart that she can project herself with me again. She agreed. She asked if she could check in with me daily to see how I‚Äôm doing. I refused because I see that as pity. I want her to think about our future, not about my well-being. So, I imposed a rule on myself‚Äîeven though it‚Äôs really hard‚Äînot to talk to her and let her come back to me on her own.

She‚Äôs an amazing girl‚Äîextraordinary, kind, and adorable, with values that are very similar to mine. The hardest part is yet to come because I have to get through this week while I‚Äôm consumed by this abyssal emptiness. My mind is clouded by all the mistakes I made despite the warnings. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll be able to make it without contacting her at the end of the week to ask where she stands. Do you think that‚Äôs a good solution? The worst part will come if she doesn‚Äôt change her mind. She‚Äôll come sleep at the apartment for a while, then pick up her things.

I‚Äôd really appreciate your thoughts on this situation, as it‚Äôs making me suffer terribly.

I was on my way home on the LIRR today and I didn‚Äôt feel my car keys. Panicked because it wasn‚Äôt on the train but there‚Äôs a chance it could, but doubtful, it‚Äôs there because I moved from my spot (but only to the seat over away from sunlight) and didn‚Äôt see or feel anything. 

So around 1:30 on the train is when I realized I lost them. I contacted my school and professor to see if my keys were given to the security guard. No luck. 

That leaves to the worst case scenario and it‚Äôs at the subway or on the street. I walked from 56th street to 50th street to catch the C train to 34th Penn Station I saw the train at the station so I ran to try and get in unfortunately I couldn‚Äôt catch it. I got the next C train and I embarrassingly tripped on the platform. Still don‚Äôt know if it was lost there but I didn‚Äôt fall too hard. Almost missed my LIRR train because there minutes left to board so I went running. 

Three instances that could cause me to lose my keys. So I have a perimeter of 56th street to 50th between 10th ave and 8th, then I have the C train station, and penn station locations to account for. I was rushing to Track 18 in between the coffee shop and acqi bowl shop. If anyone has any advice on how I can find my keys I would really appreciate it. 

Unfortunately it doesn‚Äôt have a tile or apple. I already spoke to the precinct where they would be given lost and found, made an report with both MTA and LIRR, but I feel like there‚Äôs something more to hopefully recover them.

Fast forward to me last night - passed out on the couch at 8:30, Netflix asking if I was still watching. Remote still in hand. Half-eaten dinner on the coffee table.

It finally hit me. My parents weren't boring. They were exhausted from:

* Working all day
* Managing a household
* Worrying about money
* Making sure I survived childhood
* Pretending they had it all together
* Dealing with their own parents
* Carrying mental loads I couldn't see

All while I thought their main job was to entertain me and drive me to friend's houses.

Now when I visit and my dad falls asleep in his chair, I get it. When my mom says she's ""just resting her eyes,"" I know.

So then we came up with Option B - where we're considering turning the sectional to back onto the big window and put the tv on the wall, then swivel chairs mid-room for entertaining and to still make the fireplace feel like it‚Äôs own zone.

1ixgccz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1ixgccz/explore_the_best_espresso_machine_casabrews/,Explore the best espresso machine CASABREWS CM5418-US review: Is it worth it?,"I‚Äôve had my hands on the CASABREWS CM5418-US espresso machine for a few weeks, and, as someone who takes their caffeine rituals seriously, this machine has been quite the experience. Starting my day with a robust shot of espresso or a creamy cappuccino has become a breeze, but no device is without its quirks. Let me break down my thoughts on this compact espresso maker.

**Brewing Performance**  
The brewing process is where this machine truly shines. With its 20-bar Italian pump, the espresso extraction is strong enough to create a rich and aromatic brew. Every shot I‚Äôve pulled consistently delivers a good balance of flavor and crema. However, I did notice that the machine requires some tweaking with grind size and tamping pressure for optimal results. The pressure gauge is a lifesaver here, helping me adjust settings to achieve that perfect espresso shot.

**Design & Build Quality**  
I must admit, this machine‚Äôs sleek stainless steel finish caught my eye immediately. It‚Äôs compact enough to fit snugly on my kitchen counter without taking up too much space. The buttons are straightforward to use, and the overall build feels sturdy. That said, the lightweight design can be a double-edged sword. While it‚Äôs easy to move around, I found myself holding the machine down with one hand while locking the portafilter in place‚Äîa minor annoyance, but worth mentioning.

**Coffee Quality**  
The quality of the espresso this machine produces is impressive. I‚Äôve experimented with various beans, and the results have been consistently rich and flavorful. The crema layer is thick and satisfying, especially when I use freshly ground beans. My husband, who‚Äôs always been a Nespresso loyalist, admitted that this machine makes better espresso. That‚Äôs saying something!

[Check CASABREWS CM5418-US price on Amazon.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b09x3wgj3r/)

**Milk Frothing & Steaming Capability**  
The steam wand is powerful for a machine in this price range. It‚Äôs capable of creating creamy microfoam that‚Äôs perfect for lattes or cappuccinos. I even tried my hand at some latte art, with moderately successful results (practice makes perfect, right?). However, the machine does require a cooldown period after frothing milk. If you skip this step, the device enters an overheating protection mode, which can be frustrating if you‚Äôre in a rush.

**Water Tank & Capacity**  
With a 34oz removable water tank, I‚Äôve been able to make several cups of coffee before needing a refill. The detachable feature makes it easy to clean and refill, which is a huge plus. However, if you‚Äôre brewing for a group, you‚Äôll find yourself refilling more often than you‚Äôd like.

**Maintenance & Cleaning**  
Keeping this espresso machine clean is straightforward. The drip tray and water tank are easy to remove and rinse. I‚Äôve also followed the instructions to run hot water through the system after each milk frothing session to prevent clogging, which has worked well so far. The only downside is that you need to remember these steps, or you might end up with flashing buttons and a temporarily non-functional machine.

**Energy Efficiency & Noise Levels**  
While not the quietest machine out there, the noise levels are reasonable for its power. As for energy efficiency, the automatic shut-off feature is a thoughtful addition, especially for those of us who might forget to turn the machine off in the morning rush.

**Warranty & Support**  
Registering the product with CASABREWS extended the warranty from 12 to 18 months, which gave me some peace of mind. I haven‚Äôt had to reach out to customer support yet, but reviews online suggest they‚Äôre responsive and helpful.

**Positives**

* **Boons**:
   * Stylish and compact design, ideal for small kitchens.
   * 20-bar pressure system ensures rich and aromatic espresso.
   * Easy-to-read pressure gauge for precise brewing.
   * Affordable yet high-performing for its price range.

**Negatives**

* **Critiques**:
   * Lightweight design requires holding the machine while locking the portafilter.
   * Cooldown period after frothing milk can be inconvenient.
   * Buttons flash and halt brewing if the drip tray isn‚Äôt emptied or the machine overheats.

**Market Rivals**  
Comparing this machine to others in its category, the Breville Bambino Plus stands out as a competitor. While the Bambino Plus offers faster heat-up times and automatic milk frothing, it comes at a significantly higher price. On the other hand, the De‚ÄôLonghi Dedica also competes with its slim profile and similar features but lacks the pressure gauge, which I found invaluable on the CASABREWS CM5418-US. For those prioritizing affordability without sacrificing quality, this espresso maker holds its ground impressively well.

**Price Performance**  
In terms of cost-effectiveness, this machine delivers exceptional value. It offers features like the pressure gauge and milk frother, which are often reserved for pricier models. For anyone looking to elevate their at-home coffee game without breaking the bank, this espresso maker is a worthy contender.

I have just completed another rewatch of the entire series on my new blu-ray set, and probably in record time for me (under 4 weeks). In an effort to QC all the discs in the return window (and having to get a replacement set due to scratches and cracks), I re-watched all the episodes in order. I decided to go ahead and do some ranking/reviewing for my current re-watch and share it with this loquacious bunch. Here it goes‚Ä¶

**Ranking the Seasons**

1st - Season 4

2nd - Season 6

3rd - Season 1

4th - Season 5

5th - Season 3

6th - Season 2

7th - Season 7

8th - Season 11

9th - Season 10

10th - Season 9

11th - Season 8

  


**Season Impressions**

Season 4 is just banger after banger and wipes out every other season by a long shot for me. Season 6 is a solid runner-up. The run of Seasons 4-6 is unparalleled.

I was surprised I ranked Season 2 as low as I did, and I considered swapping it with Season 7 even to rank it 7th. Turns out I was just lukewarm on most of the episodes - I sort of counted up how many I‚Äôd considered my favorites in each season and how many I would probably skip on a re-watch, and technically Season 7 beat out Season 2 with favorites, but I think overall Season 2 needed to be a touch higher. Season 7 suffers from Daphne‚Äôs family, and although I think Simon had his moments, I can‚Äôt stand Mrs. Moon.

Season 1 is just so solid and I always enjoy watching it over again. I still think the pilot is an amazing episode, made even better by the fact that most pilots are terrible and this definitely isn‚Äôt!

No surprise I‚Äôm sure that Season 8 is dead last. It has a lot of skips for me and only a couple of favorites. Still, no season of Frasier is truly all bad.

  


**Ranking Favorite/Least Favorite Episodes By Season**

Season 1 Favorite - Travels With Martin

Season 1 Least Favorite - And The Whimper Is‚Ä¶

Probably no surprises here, though I struggled with ties on some of these in both categories. I didn‚Äôt watch Cheers and so tend to dislike those guest appearance episodes in general. I also seem to dislike the Sea Bee episodes aside from the one in Season 2. I acknowledge they aren‚Äôt *bad* but I guess I am lukewarm on them. No shock that I don‚Äôt care for the Dr. Mary episodes - and really has nothing to do with Kim Coles. I just hate the storylines and Frasier is awful to her. Also, I hate Mrs. Moon. I would have rather had more Simon and Mr. Moon, as I think Brian Cox is a treasure and Anthony LaPaglia at least made me laugh from time to time.

  


**Reviewing Frasier‚Äôs Love Interests**

This will **NOT** include Lilith, Nanette, or Diane. To get it out of the way, I hate Diane, love Lilith and think Laurie Metcalf was pretty funny.

*Funniest Love Interests/Conquests*: Lorna (Lana), Faye, Bebe, Roz, Alistair, Kim (Jennifer Tilly)

*Most Boring/Grating Love Interests/Conquests*: Julia, Sam, Regan

*Best Matches for Frasier*: Faye, Claire, Alistair

It is astounding to me that of all the love interests, Julia has the most amount of episodes. She is awful and I find no redeeming qualities. Sam has a boring storyline and is such a dry character (and not in a dry humor sort of way) and Regan is just sort of ‚Äúthere.‚Äù¬†

I thought Faye was a great match for Frasier - she was beautiful, smart, funny and a little quirky. He messed up good with Cassandra - I mean Faye! Fabulous Faye! Forever Faye!

Claire was also a pretty good match for Frasier - classy with similar interests. She also got along with the family, even if Daphne didn‚Äôt appreciate her until she was gone.¬†

Of course, Alistair would‚Äôve been excellent if not for Frasier‚Äôs hetero tendencies. He really did like being the spoiled one in a relationship.

*Honorable mention*: Kate - I don‚Äôt think she was the funniest or the best match for Frasier, but she did give him a run for his money.

Lorna/Lana was a wild but hilarious character (Jean Smart is just like that). She stuck around a little too long in my opinion, but damned if that first episode of hers isn‚Äôt funny. Kirby was a drag on the show.

Bebe - oh, Bebe! She happens to be my fianc√©‚Äôs favorite side character, and while she was only a conquest, what a memorable one with so many great lines.¬†

Roz - I still wish that Frasier and Roz hadn‚Äôt slept together. Would‚Äôve been nice to just keep them as great friends who never got together at all.

Kim - a brief appearance but I love Jennifer Tilly. I also know she was a love interest on Cheers as well, albeit a different character. She makes me laugh.

Charlotte - I have to mention because he goes after her at the end‚Ä¶she was just okay. I don‚Äôt like that she sort of grifted Frasier out of $10k, sort of cheated on Frank with him and overall just didn‚Äôt seem that *into* Frasier in general. Maybe it‚Äôs that I didn‚Äôt see a ton of chemistry between Laura Linney and Kelsey, so it was hard to swallow that he‚Äôd lie awake thinking about her and said that they felt like they‚Äôd known each other forever. Definitely not enough time for her to be the end game.

  


**Ranking Martin‚Äôs Love Interests**

There aren‚Äôt as many for Martin, so I‚Äôll rank my top 3, not including Hester.

1.Sherry

I love Marsha Mason. She brings such wonderful energy and is a fantastic foil for Frasier and Niles. She is definitely flawed, but I think she had the best chemistry with Martin.

2. Ronee

Wendie Malick is always great and I truly enjoy her jokes with Frasier about being his new mom. I felt like she was meant to be a toned down, classier version of Sherry, but she did feel rushed. I would‚Äôve liked a bit more time with her. A bit creepy to marry the boy‚Äôs former babysitter, but whatever. Also, her wig was terrible.

3. Cora

Would‚Äôve loved for more of a storyline here and explored what that would‚Äôve done for Cam and Frasier.¬†

P.S. I hate Bonnie, and glad that eventually Martin did, too. Why they cast Eva Marie Saint as Roz‚Äôs ‚Äúboring‚Äù mom is beyond me. She seemed pretty delightful and Bonnie seemed to be the snooze fest to me. ‚ÄúWe HATE them!‚Äù

  


**Ranking Niles‚Äô Love Interests**

Only my top 3 here again, as there are far less to choose from.

1. Daphne

How can anyone compete with Daphne?¬†She‚Äôs a goddess!

If it hadn‚Äôt been DHP in the role of Niles, I don‚Äôt know if his pining for Daphne storyline would‚Äôve worked so well. He‚Äôs just so damn charming and delightful and makes the whole thing way less creepy than it is. I don‚Äôt know if I like how Daphne and Niles changed after getting together - Daphne became less funny/quirky and Niles became more serious, but they had wonderful chemistry so it felt right.¬†

2. Maris

Is Maris quite possibly the best character to never appear on a show? Or maybe she was there, coyly hiding behind a breadstick.

3. Kit

I think she‚Äôs funnier than Poppy and less annoying than Poppy AND Mel, so there you go.

  


**Ranking Daphne‚Äôs Love Interests**

1. Niles

They had such amazing chemistry, and although I despise the fat storyline to cover her real life pregnancy, the resolution to it was sweet. He finally takes her off the pedestal and has a real relationship with her. He mellows her out a bit, but the flip side is she‚Äôs less funny and a bit more nagging.¬†

2. Donny

I like Donny! I don‚Äôt like what they did to him in Season 10. Him still holding a candle for Daphne while going through rushed marriages was just sad. Donny deserved better. He may have love bombed Daphne, but Niles took that to eleven, and I think Donny‚Äôs feelings were just a genuine as Niles‚Äô. As a bonus I think his proposal to Daphne was incredibly sweet. Could have been cool to see him reconnect with Roz in the end instead.

3. Rodney

A funny doppelg√§nger for Niles and a bit of a pretentious fop if you ask me.

  


**Ranking Roz‚Äôs Love Interests**

1. Roger

She really messed this one up, but I would‚Äôve liked Roger as end game for her. I don‚Äôt like that they wrote him out of the show, but I guess Tony Goldwyn was hard to nail down or something.

2. Donny

I know this is a technicality as they didn‚Äôt date *on* the show, but I liked them in Decoys and think that could have been a fun re-matching, provided he could have moved on from Daphne emotionally.

3. Bulldog

I think they had great chemistry, but I understand not pairing them as an actual couple. I don‚Äôt think him using a pregnant Roz as a human shield is something you can come back from in a real relationship. But, I liked seeing his growth because of Roz, even if it‚Äôs a little unhinged.

  


**Reviewing Our Side Characters**

***Lilith*** \- every appearance of hers is a treat, and you can always see her chemistry with Frasier. It‚Äôs a shame she cheated on him, but she made for an excellent love/hate relationship. I wish she had ended up with Brent Spiner from S10, though! If I could swap her last two episodes I would, okaaaay.

Favorite Lilith Episode: Room Service (S5)

***Bebe*** \- so great and over the top. I love her delivery of ‚ÄúI can be like Ben ‚Äî only competent!‚Äù And ‚ÄúWell, there‚Äôs always a chance.‚Äù So good.¬†

Favorite Bebe Episode: Where There‚Äôs Smoke, There‚Äôs Fired (S3)

***Noel*** \- introduced so early on, and always holding a candle for Roz‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a bit creepy with him harassing her and interesting they kept him around all those seasons

Favorite Noel Episode: Star Mitzvah (S10)

***Bulldog*** \- if it was anyone but Dan Butler, would it have worked as well? Obviously a character of the time period, but I love when he gets his comeuppances. Also, sad he wasn‚Äôt in the final episode at KACL behind Frasier‚Äôs booth.

Favorite Bulldog Episode: The Dog That Rocks the Cradle (S7)

***Gil*** \- delightfully over the top and bitchy. Closeted or not? Who knows. Only Deb, maybe. Otherwise he‚Äôs romping with his school chums in the fens and spinneys‚Ä¶

Favorite Gil Episode: Ham Radio (S4)

***Kenny*** \- well, they found a station manager to stick around who wouldn‚Äôt be anyone‚Äôs love interest. Kenny is okay. I don‚Äôt like his wife, and I think there‚Äôs a bit too much of him in S10, but he provides someone to bounce jokes off of.¬†

Favorite Kenny Episode: Hot Pursuit (S7)

  


**Reviewing Our Main Characters**

**Roz** \- I enjoy Roz overall, but after she has Alice her character becomes more and more annoying and less and less funny. She gets angry about dating as a single mom despite choosing that route for herself, but it isn‚Äôt funny. She goes on weird tirades and I can‚Äôt stand her becoming jealous of Julia and acting like she‚Äôs in love with Frasier when she‚Äôs not. After they resolve the Julia storyline in S11, she starts acting more like Roz of the earlier seasons and I like her again for the end of the show. Her judging Roger was odd, considering how many men of various backgrounds she dated (not to mention having the baby of a 20 year old student). I feel like they didn‚Äôt know what to do with her character arc so she suffered for a while.

**Daphne** \- funny but sometimes annoying, I guess she was the cr√®me between the two cookies of Frasier and Martin. I think one of my favorite line deliveries is her getting drunk after catching feelings for Niles and talking about ‚ÄúShaking your friggin‚Äô finger at me.‚Äù She can be quirky, sweet, a hothead, and annoying all at once. I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôd feel about Daphne without Niles pining after her, though. It‚Äôs nice she becomes official Crane family, but I could have done with a lot less of her British family. Gertrude was awful and served no purpose outside of a couple episodes. It was a huge strike against Daphne‚Äôs character that I had to suffer her family so much. Less is more of those folks. Also, I realized she had two broken engagements (Clive and Donny), before finally marrying Niles. It sort of mirrors Niles having two previous marriages before they get together, and the differences & similarities in their personalities.

**Martin** \- such an interesting character, from learning he forgave Hester for cheating, to learning to date again, being disappointed in Frasier and Niles but actually being proud of them as well. His blue collar ways juxtaposed against Frasier and Niles refined and pretentious tastes. I think it would‚Äôve been nice to have a scene in ‚ÄúRoom Full of Heroes‚Äù where he and Niles actually talk about why Niles felt the need to portray Marty the way he did. Martin does indeed make a lot of references to his disappointment in his sons, and I felt they needed a scene to resolve that better. Also, for all the trouble he went through to buy Sherry a ring despite her not wanting to be married again, it was poor form to put so little effort and thought into Ronee‚Äôs engagement ring, er, Lil Cupid‚Äôs toe ring. Yikes. It‚Äôs why I think Sherry was his best match. I think my favorite Martin lines are ‚ÄúAlright, I‚Äôll bring a snake,‚Äù and ‚ÄúDog army.‚Äù Delivery is amazing. I also crack up at his reaction when Frasier pets him while pretending to bring him to the old folks home to pick up a woman. ‚ÄúYes, dad, a tour.‚Äù I miss you John Mahoney. And that chair.

**Niles** \- I think Niles has the biggest and best character arc of the series. He goes from being a complete doormat to actually setting some boundaries in his marriage to Daphne. Going from wealthy to poor to wealthy again - landing the woman of his dreams and his rivalry with Frasier. What a character. DHP does some of the best slapstick/physical comedy, and his deliveries of some magnificent lines are top notch. ‚ÄúHer lips said no, but her eyes said read my lips.‚Äù I can‚Äôt tell you how often I say ‚ÄúThaaaan kyoooooou‚Äù and ‚ÄúI‚Äôm thinking of pairing this Chilean sea bass with an aggressive Zinfandel.‚Äù I think Niles is at his best when he‚Äôs free of Maris but before he gets together with Daphne, Mel not withstanding. I love his barbs with Roz and while I understand why people would have wanted to explore a relationship between the two of them, I don‚Äôt know if it would have fit.

**Frasier** \- ah, our titular character. This rewatch really had me more and more impressed with Kelsey, to the point where he was indeed my favorite character. While this cast was lightning in a bottle, it would be nothing without Kelsey. I don‚Äôt think Frasier really grows much as a character over the course of the series, except perhaps having a better relationship with both Martin and Niles. But, how can you possibly continue a character if they grow *too* much? While I love the Niles and Daphne storyline, it was nice to bring the show back around to Frasier again. He‚Äôs the butt of so many jokes and Kelsey just leans into all of it with aplomb. The failed dinner parties, the sibling rivalry, his sex-a-holism and self-sabotage of all his relationships‚Ä¶I love his over the top nature and his touch of a little Tahitian Vanilla. I even enjoy his more uncomfortable episodes where he continually digs himself into a hole. It wouldn‚Äôt be Frasier without them. As I mentioned above, not a Charlotte fan, but him going off to chase a relationship is not a bad way to end things and the most Frasier-like thing he could do.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

I‚Äôm thrilled to have my blu-ray set (I have all the dvds as well and digital copies on Fandango at Home) as I‚Äôm a physical media collector. I will say a couple things though - there seems to be a small authoring error on ‚ÄúRoe To Perdition‚Äù as they run after Roz out of Cafe Nervosa. The picture and audio drop out instead of fade out and my replacement disc was also like this tried in three different players. Oh well I guess. Also, I know they supposedly shot it all on film but S10 looks horrible, like it was shot on DV instead. There are striations and artifacting that are not present on the other seasons. Either they shot it on inferior film stock or the processing was just not as cared for or something. I like that S1-9 are in 4:3 with the exception of ‚ÄúThe Fight Before Christmas‚Äù which is 16:9 in S7 and that in general they are significant upgrades to the dvds, except for S10. I just never intend to watch it this quickly ever again. I want to savor it next time.

Until the next go around‚Ä¶I‚Äôll miss the coffees.

**Rating** E 

**Summary:**

It's 1987 London and anti-gay sentiment is on the rise ahead of the government's push to pass Section 28 to prohibited the ""promotion of homosexuality"" by local authorities -- including banning books and education in schools.

Why do Fell, low level government administrator, and Crowley, a ""fixer"" for a nefarious consulting company and reluctant queer community organiser, keep running into each other -- quite literally? Is it just romantic fate bringing together two middle aged ""confirmed bachelors"" who thought it was too late to find love, or is there some other connection? Can they figure it out? (Are they sure they want to?)

**Chapter Excerpt:**

Aziraphale watched intently as he blustered around the room, shoving a chair out of his way as if it had personally offended him, clearing the coffee table with a swoop of his arm, then scooting it closer to the sofa. How did someone manage to be furiously doting? But it just wouldn‚Äôt do for Crowley to keep treating him as if he were made of glass!¬† It was all good and well to be cared for, but Aziraphale was not an invalid, and Crowley was not his nursemaid.¬†

Crowley put the tray of tea and biscuits down on the coffee table, popped the lid back,¬† peered inside ‚Äì¬† he frowned in disapproval, the tea leaves not having done their job to his satisfaction ‚Äì¬† let the lid drop and turned, almost certainly about to suggest more water or another pillow fluffing. But Aziraphale had taken advantage of the moment and was already on his feet and at close quarters. He looked Crowley up and down appraisingly as he rolled up his shirt sleeves. Yes, he could manage this easily.¬†

With iced energy and the 13 drinks announced yesterday being dropped, that means 14% of the menu has been cut. Brian's stated multiple times he intends to trim at least 30% of the menu, meaning we're due for at least another 17 drinks being dropped.

  
I have a feeling most of these are just going to be removing variations of drinks in exchange for customizing base drinks, like getting rid of the iced tea lemonades as standalone drinks and promoting the iced teas, customized with lemonade. But I'm curious what you think he might drop, and what you're hoping he does(n't). And so far, do you think these cuts are mostly positive or negative?",60,1740439071.0,starbucks,18,0.96,False

I've tried every flavor of dry food, treats, wet food and I just don't know what I can do","Once upon a time he only liked pate, then he didn't, tried chunky, shredded, every style and flavor of wet food. Just licks some of the gravy off and then goes right back to pestering me for some magic fuckin food that doesn't exist.

I'm just looking for any ideas because it's getting out of hand. I've been home from work 2 hours as of typing this, I fed him the moment I got in the door, he took like one bite and just started begging again. And he will do this until I leave for work in the morning, dead ass he will not stop jumping on me, scratching at his bowls, knocking shit off the table etc. and he'll do it for 12, 16 hours straight. Doesn't matter what I give him, catering to him doesn't work (like if I gave him new food right now he would still just beg for that miracle food I can't find), and I'm honestly losing my mind. 

I can't make a noise without him doing figure 8s around my feet and begging for food he already has. Need to pee at 230am? He'll run over and beg. forgot my coffee in the other room? Time for a 5 foot walk to take several minutes of trying not to step on the cat.

I love the cat, I really do, but I cannot stress the word ""constantly"" enough. No matter what I try to feed him he just turns his nose up at it and bitches that he's hungry. 24/7, and I mean that 100% seriously. I have no idea what else I can do I've tried every frickin flavor of everything for him.

And the thing is, once in a while he'll actually wolf something down and clean his bowl, but next time I try that flavor he won't even sniff it. And I don't just give him the same thing every day I switch it up so it's not like he's just tired of the same thing all the time.

So yeah, TLDR is - nothing I give the cat is good enough for him and I'm just looking for advice on what I could try. I just want the little shit to be happy but with how he acts you would think I never feed him. Thanks for any responses",13,1740438997.0,cats,15,0.94,False

The relationship started out, funnily enough on Reddit (under a now deleted account when we moved to WhatsApp). It started with me offering advice on posts he made about a ex he had. Anyway, fast forward we broke up and got back together multiple times - which, I know is bad and I should have left him go, but we loved each other and for the short time it worked, it was amazing.

But, I guess now that this time it really is over - I‚Äôm moreso hurt that I didn‚Äôt get to experience things everyone else in his life got to. My ex has physiological issue where he cannot speak, and that‚Äôs due to a series of things - I‚Äôm not getting into that, but - I never got to hear him speak. Ever. And I know it haunts him, not being able to speak - but it hurts knowing for the first 3 months of our relationship he could speak, but he didn‚Äôt to me. 

I made the effort to speak, to listen and to help comfort him. He did the same, minus the speaking part. It just hurts knowing on nights outs he want on, those guys he talked to got to hear him. Or his ex, who turned out to be an abusive twat. Or his friends, family, even down to people who work in a coffee shop he‚Äôd go into.

I know it‚Äôs stupid - I know that, I know I‚Äôm being unreasonable and I‚Äôm just, reaching for anything to try distract from the fact I want to crawl back into his arms and cry. 

Is there anything I can do, to just try get over it - one hour at a time. 

We talked about so much. We shared over 500,000 messages across Reddit and WhatsApp (yes, I checked because I used to remind him, and no, we never got to meet. We had plans to, but life events happened but we live only 2 hours away). We‚Äôre inseparable, and it just hurts that I‚Äôll never get to experience it myself.

I don‚Äôt really know what I‚Äôm asking for. I have no hatred for him, he‚Äôs the most beautiful man I‚Äôve ever known, inside and out, but anyway, that‚Äôs my post

‚Äì Alleviates depression, at least in the sort term.   
‚Äì Access to a connection with doms. When you're lonely, it's nice to have a chat with someone who is usually glad to hear from you.   
‚Äì Access to a community of fellow subs. Being part of a stable of subs is a strong connection with other people who know what you are going through and see a part of you you don't usually share with others.  
‚Äì Better pick-me-up than coffee. Goodbye afternoon doldrums. FinDom is a great stimulant.   
‚Äì¬†Makes a kind of sexual connection possible for older or less good looking men.   
‚Äì Easier to schedule and more convenient than IRL dating or even sex workers. Why fill out a profile on a dating app and deal with waiting, stress and rejection when doms are online and available right now?  
‚Äì Powerful pain killer. Have a stress headache? Sick with the flu? The adrenaline from FinDom is stronger, I guarantee it.

As I mentioned, test was fairly straightforward. Lots of questions on registration/definitions/capacities of BDs/IAs/Issuers. State jusrisdiction. Brochure rules. Exempt transactions and securities. Ethics and advertising rules. A few point and shoot Dec 31st questions. A NASAA CE question popped up -not sure if it‚Äôs counted (6+6 annually btw - check the NASAA website). A few trust and insurance questions. A viatacal settlement question on its purpose. A couple of options and futures questions.

Know your trust accounts. Balance sheets - I know it‚Äôs a small part of the test, but economic factors are easy opportunities to create a cushion. 

My firm supplied Pass Perfect, Kaplan practice exams and STC. STC was my favorite vendor - their materials and practice tests better reflect the real thing imo. Supplemented with Guru vids and purchased Brian‚Äôs Test Geek course. Ken‚Äôs videos are also helpful!

1ixfzjb,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ixfzjb/rf_a_smalltown_caf√©/,[RF] A Small-Town Caf√©,"It was a quiet evening at a small town caf√©. The kind of place where regulars had their own seats and where the coffee pot never stopped brewing. The air smelled of fresh pancakes, sizzling bacon, and burnt toast that had been left in the toaster a little too long. A few patrons sat at wooden booths, stirring their coffee or picking at half-eaten sandwiches. A lone ceiling fan creaked overhead, barely moving the stale air.

At a corner booth, two old men sat nursing their mugs of black coffee, their wrinkled faces illuminated by the soft glow of a neon sign flickering from the window. They wore flannel shirts and worn-out trucker hats, the kind of men who had spent a lifetime working with their hands.

Old Man 1 (Joe) leaned back in his chair and sighed. ‚ÄúY‚Äôknow,‚Äù he started, shaking his head. ‚ÄúThere is something very wrong with America, and it‚Äôs been wrong for a very long time. It is big, and it is black.‚Äù

A hush fell over the nearby tables. A young woman in a hoodie glanced up from her phone. A man flipping through a newspaper froze mid-page turn. The teenage employee wiping down the counter‚Äîlet‚Äôs call her Bethany‚Äîpaused, eyes widening as she processed what she just heard.

Joe‚Äôs friend, Old Man 2 (Earl), gave a solemn nod. ‚ÄúYep, Joe. I agree with you.‚Äù

Joe took another sip of his coffee, his brow furrowed in deep thought. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve had these feelings for quite some time.‚Äù

Bethany, still holding the rag, blinked.

Earl sighed and ran a hand over his stubbly chin. ‚ÄúYou know, I just can‚Äôt really stand to look at them. Always so threatening. So dangerous.‚Äù

At a nearby table, a young couple exchanged an uneasy glance. A mother sitting with her two kids subtly pulled them closer. The tension in the room thickened, the distant hum of the diner‚Äôs old radio the only background noise.

Joe scoffed, shaking his head. ‚ÄúWell, what do you know? I can‚Äôt stand it when they look at *me*.‚Äù

Earl nodded. ‚ÄúYep, Joe. And it‚Äôs always very threatening and dangerous.‚Äù

Bethany, trying to keep things under control, cleared her throat. ‚ÄúSir‚Ä¶ is everything okay?‚Äù

Earl looked up, surprised by the question. ‚ÄúYep, everything is okay.‚Äù

Joe cracked his knuckles. ‚ÄúAnyway, as I was saying. I just don‚Äôt really feel safe living among them. They are threatening our community.‚Äù

Earl leaned forward, lowering his voice like he was about to reveal a dark secret. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs darn right! If I could afford a gun right now, I‚Äôd shoot them on sight.‚Äù

The room nearly stopped breathing. Silverware clattered. A woman sitting at the counter covered her mouth in horror. A man near the jukebox turned his head slowly, as if making sure he heard correctly.

Earl smirked. ‚ÄúYep, that‚Äôll teach them.‚Äù

That was it.

Bethany set down her rag and stepped out from behind the counter. ‚ÄúOkay, guys, I‚Äôm gonna have to ask you to leave.‚Äù

Joe raised a hand. ‚ÄúYep, just one moment. Speaking of which, I was gonna buy one next week‚Ä¶‚Äù

That was the final straw.

A woman in a floral dress shot up from her seat. ‚ÄúYou guys are *sick!* Absolutely sick!‚Äù

A man near the entrance shook his head in disgust. ‚ÄúYeah, I think you should leave.‚Äù

Just then, another old man at a nearby table‚ÄîOld Man 3 (Henry)‚Äîlowered his newspaper, finally catching up on the conversation. He adjusted his glasses. ‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶ what are you guys talking about?‚Äù

Joe turned toward him, as if it were obvious. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre talking about getting a Remington.‚Äù

Henry frowned. ‚ÄúNo, *before that*.‚Äù

Joe furrowed his brows. ‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

Henry hesitated. ‚ÄúThe part where you said it was big, black, and dangerous?‚Äù

Joe blinked. ‚ÄúOh. We were just talking about all those black bears that keep popping up in the woods.‚Äù

Silence.

Then‚Äîan exhale of relief swept through the caf√©. A man near the register let out an awkward chuckle. The couple at the corner booth looked at each other and shook their heads. The woman who had been shouting just moments ago threw her hands in the air, absolutely dumbfounded.

Bethany facepalmed.

‚ÄúOh,‚Äù Henry said, his expression shifting from concern to mild embarrassment.

Earl nodded, glad someone else understood. ‚ÄúYeah, you should‚Äôve seen some of them out in the countryside. Some of them can stand up to seven feet tall.‚Äù

Joe whistled. ‚ÄúYep. The closest I‚Äôve gotten to one was a football field away. I don‚Äôt mess around with them, *especially* with Momma Bear.‚Äù

Earl shuddered. ‚ÄúBut yeah, what did you *think* we were talking about?‚Äù

Henry froze for half a second. His eyes darted around the room. He forced a tight smile. ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ yeah, I was just wondering what you guys were talking about because it sounded pretty relatable!‚Äù

The three old men laughed.

Earl stretched. ‚ÄúWell, we better get going. The nice young lady told us to leave, and we don‚Äôt wanna overstay our welcome.‚Äù

Bethany, still rubbing her temples, waved them off. ‚ÄúNo, you guys are welcome to stay. I just had a mi‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no, it‚Äôs all fine,‚Äù Earl said, standing up. ‚ÄúWe were just about to leave anyway. Hey, here‚Äôs a tip!‚Äù He slid a crumpled bill onto the table.

Joe patted his pocket. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve got some bear rounds to buy.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, goodnight everyone!‚Äù Earl called as they shuffled toward the door. ‚ÄúTake care! Nice meeting you, sir.‚Äù

Henry nodded. ‚ÄúAlright, goodnight! Haha‚Ä¶‚Äù

As the other two left, Henry lingered for a second, glancing around to make sure no one was looking. Under the table, he pulled something out of his pocket‚Äîa tiny Confederate flag‚Äîbut as soon as he noticed a woman at the counter eyeing him, he quickly slid it back into his pocket.

And with that, he finished his coffee.

Then I stopped. Took a breath. Actually looked at what was happening.

In my rush to save time, I was:

* Missing obvious things right in front of me
* Making careless mistakes I had to fix
* Creating a mental fog that slowed my thinking
* Generating stress that made simple tasks difficult

Something clicked. This wasn't just about my chaotic morning. It was my entire approach to life. Always hurrying. Always trying to squeeze more in. Always creating the very delays I was trying to avoid.

Started experimenting with deliberate slowness. Not laziness, but presence. Full attention on one thing at a time.

The strangest part? Things actually started happening faster. Found my keys immediately. Packed my bag without forgetting anything. Even arrived early.

Still catch myself rushing sometimes. Still feel that pull to hurry. But now I recognize it for what it is - a false promise that speed equals efficiency.

1ixfv89,https://www.reddit.com/r/retailhell/comments/1ixfv89/this_job_is_getting_worse/,This job is getting worse,"TLDR: Everyone sucks at this place. Waiting to see if I got the job I interviewed for today. 


So....this job has just gotten even worse. My coworker is still harassing me and I actually snapped at her yesterday because of it (and then she asked me out for coffee on Wednesday??) 


But on Saturday, my district manager came in. I had only met him once for like 5 minutes my first week so I didn't recognize him. He was such a dick the entire time that it was even pissing off his girlfriend. He put his cases of soda at the end of the conveyor belt despite knowing it is broken, didn't make any conversation, and then he didn't even return his cart (we don't have an outside cart...thing). 


Then I came in yesterday to learn he was furious at us because the store was ""a filthy mess."" But he came in an hour before close, when we always started facing the shleves per his damn rules. Also I should add that it's only two of us on closing shift. My manager that night made the DM mad because DM made a remark that Saturdays aren't busy...and my manager corrected him to let him know they very much are. Also on Saturdays, our main focuses are getting HBA put away from Friday truck and placing the Sunday coupons. That manager got in trouble for putting like two HBA items away for me because he shouldn't ever help his coworker when he has tasks. 


That crazy coworker told me SHE was deciding to add more rules or we'll get written up. Even said she will be making every other person mad. It's such a small thing too...just initializing the task sheet. Which our GM doesn't even enforce on his shifts. She also added assistant manager to her name tag..which she is AN assistant manager. That's what our company calls every single shift lead. We don't have an official AM. But when she talks to customers about it she insists she's THE assistant manager and even lied and said she first started as a shift lead before being promoted. Any time I criticized the DM, she would defend his actions even if they made no sense. I calmed myself down enough and texted my coworker to talk me out of walking out after our fight. Also she tried to trash talk the cashiers for not putting security stickers on HBA items but we do sticker the required items as it shows on the shelf label. She wants us to sticker everything. I won't unless a real higher up tells me to. 


Coworker then sat on her ass and did nothing that shift. Then we had a theft but she didn't tell me amd disappeared in the office to check cameras (then later said multiple times she didn't check them yet). When she came back, I had a decent line forming. At my store if you have three or more in line you need to call for backup (she was backup). But a customer told her that he saw the thief steal from another store in the plaza. So instead of calling that store, she just left me alone to go to the store. At my job, you are not allowed to leave the area of the store at all, even on break (only managers get breaks and cashiers may need them for their codes or for change). When she walked out, the line was already forming around the store. By the time she returned and also taking a moment to vape, I had most of the line down. She checked out three people before walking off to finally call the cops.


Also I'm upset because the only coworker I trusted (the one I texted), talked about me to crazy coworker behind my back. It wasn't anything really anything substantial..and when crazy coworker confronted me about it, I was able to twist it in a joking way. But come on man...I trusted you..we've spent so many shifts complaining about crazy coworker only for him to tell her things I've said? 


Anyway, I had an interview today that hopefully went well. It's a harder job but more pay and more hours and less customers..plus I'll mostly be working alone. Everyone who worked there before said it was awful but it seems like they just didnt like the rule of not having your phone out and needing to clean regularly. Idk. Even if I hate it, I think it'll be better that what I have now. ",4,1740438259.0,retailhell,0,0.84,False

 How was this possible?! For how long? How long had he been cheating on me?! How long had he been exposing me to potential STIs? The thought made me want to vomit.

Raven POV
I'd been with Matthew since I was twenty. At twenty-eight, I had always had confidence in myself. I'd always been happy with my looks and maturity level. Leave it to my husband, Matthew to tear me down. I'm standing outside his office. I came with to surprise him with dinner from our favorite sushi place. We've been distant the last few months. We're both up for promotions. I got mine. Matthew took me out to celebrate, but it was cut short do to 'work'. So, here I am, a week later, the day he's supposed to know if he got the promotion, and he's 'still working'. Working on throwing some other woman's back out is more what it sounds like.
I set the paper bag down on the coffee table in the reception area, take my heels off on the carpet so he doesn't hear me approaching (and to make a cleaner exit), and pulled my phone out, being as quiet as possible. I start recording as I was up to his office door, pushing it open ever so slightly to get a better angle. I have to see if this is really what I think it is, what my mind is telling me it is. Because judging from the moaning and groaning, and exclamations about his magical shaft, I'm assuming some other woman is f-cking my husband. I stick my phone in just a little further, and my heart drops. There is my husband, f-cking his boss on top of his desk, where he used to f-ck me. Is this the late work he's been doing? I pull out my work phone and call his number. He doesn't answer. I end the call. He saw me calling, and chose to keep f-cking her. I zoom in on him not wearing a rubber, making a mental note to call the nearest planned parenthood to get me in tomorrow morning for an STI test.
f-cking sick.
The woman turns her head, her eyes closed in ecstasy, and I see it's for sure his boss, Karen. He's banging his 42-year-old boss. She's two years older than him. Fourteen years older than me. What?! I watched as my husband came inside of her, smiling at her like he used to smile at me. What was happening?! How was this possible?! For how long? How long had he been cheating on me?! How long had he been exposing me to potential STI's? The thought made me want to vomit. He leaned down, k-ssing her as he pulled out. I wanted to barf then, and it came up, but I couldn't move. I needed to get all the evidence.
""You're really going to divorce her?"" I swallowed, listening intently waiting for his response.
""Yes, babe. I met with someone today. I have to file first if I want the advantage. And, let's be honest, I want the advantage. She probably has no idea this is coming?""
""Have you moved anything out of the joint accounts you guys have?""
""No. I have another appointment with a real shark of a lawyer tomorrow. Names Sullivan? Heard of him?""
""He's a shark alright."" Sullivan? Nan's lawyer? Who became my lawyer? What?
""After meeting with him, I'll move money so I can get the most out of this. We'll be better off than before."" He k-ssed her again. I ended the video, grabbed my shoes, bag of sushi and ran back downstairs. I rushed out of there as fast I could, calling the one person I knew would help me no matter what.
""M-mom? Mom! He's f-cking his boss. I have proof. He's meeting Sullivan tomorrow. I need help."" She gasped, while I struggled to hold it together. I was so close to losing it and I did not need that while driving.
""Come over. Now. We've got to get on top of this.""
I hung up the phone and sprinted for my car. Just as I got in and started it, the skies opened up. A downpour like we hadn't seen in months started as I made my way safely to Emily's. Ryder was already asleep when I got there. I peeked in on him, and made my way to the kitchen.
""Tell me everything."" She demanded. I pulled my phone out of my sushi bag and played the video for her. She sat there for a few minutes after it was over, like she was processing everything and getting more pissed the more she thought. Emily was more than my boss; she was the surrogate mother in my life. I grew up an orphan. Both parents were killed in a car accident about ten years ago, just before I turned nine. I bounced from foster home to foster home. No one wanting me. Even after college, I struggled to find a place to live, and then I struggled to find a job until I landed at Emily's design company. She hired me right away, saying she was glad her competition couldn't see what she could. After my six-month probationary period, she called me into her office. She showed me all the letters I'd received from people who had passed on the first time around, who now wanted me services.
My mouth hung open as she said, ""I told you they'd regret it one day."" She'd been right. She took that chance on me and became a close friend and confidant. Then I really opened up to her, and she happily said she'd be my mother, never had her own children. A year later, Stormi joined us for her internship in college.
""I'm going to call Jefferson. Give me a moment."" She held her phone to her ear, straightening her shoulders like the man would be able to see her through the phone, ""Jefferson! How are you, darling? Yes, yes. Listen, I have a question. You know my girl, Raven?"" She smiled, ""Well, unfortunately we just caught her husband and mistress in the act. We also caught him saying that he's going to meet with Sullivan tomorrow, who just so happens to be Raven's lawyer. He can't do that can he?""
She looked at me. ""Thanks doll,"" she hung up. ""He's coming over. He's only two streets over.""
Ten minutes later, the bell rang. And in walked a very handsome looking silver fox, eyeing Emily like she was prey. ""We're going to call him and see what he says.""
""Who?"" She asked.
""Raven is going to call her lawyer. If he lies about meeting with Matthew tomorrow, there's something fishy going on and we need to figure it out fast. Or, he tells her the truth about meeting with him and that he's been given some nonsense excuse for the meeting. Those are the possibilities."" We looked at the man. He seemed so sure of himself. But he was right.
""If he lies. How do we catch him? How do we get proof?""
""I've already given my PI a heads up that I might have a case for him. Call this lawyer up. Put him on speaker when he answers."" He nodded at me. I pulled out my phone, scrolling the contacts until I found Sullivan's name. I clicked on the call icon, letting it ring, and ring and ring.
""Hey Sullivan! I was just looking at our calendar and I see that there's a meeting tomorrow. Did I forget? Or did you and Matthew for get to tell me?"" I ask, in a light-hearted, teasing tone.
""Oh! Hello Raven! No. I don't see anything on the books for tomorrow.""
""Oh. Maybe it was mix up. Weird. Alright. You have a great night!"" I said cheerily, as Emily and her lawyer looked mad enough to destroy something. He's pulling out his phone as I'm hanging up the call.
""ED! I need you on this. Yes. My woman's little girl. Her cheating husband and her lawyer are going behind her back. Tomorrow. Money's no issue. Get whoever you can on it."" He hung up, grabbing Emily's hand, stroking the back of it with his thumb in a calming manner, ""I'll have the information by tomorrow morning. Eight at the latest."" Emily nodded like this was expected.
""Your woman?"" I raised an eyebrow, asking the man and my surrogate mother. Emily blushed and Jefferson puffed his chest out, holding her hand proudly, ""Yes,"" was all he said, looking like a proud peacock. I couldn't blame him though; he did have a prize on his hands. I smiled at them; happy she's found love. A love that seems to make them both lost in each other.
 
Raven POV
I've been here for the weekend with Ryder. I know we can't stay here indefinitely, but staying Thursday night all the way through til Monday morning sounded like heaven. A nice little get away from him and his lying and cheating. He's probably done filthy things to our bed. Ugh.
Thankfully Jefferson will be representing me. He's already reported Sullivan to the board about his conflict of interest, and all the money he'd need to pay me back since he'd been working with my soon-to-be-ex-husband for the last two years to f-ck me over in a divorce. Friday, I had a delivery sent to my husband at the office, which had a bug in it so I'd know his next move. I also let him know we had to up our home security as it wasn't up-to-date anymore. I called first, and went to see him at lunch. I told him I need his signature on some stuff for the upgrades for the system and an update to the Wills and life insurance policies. Which wasn't a total lie. I just took his name off of everything if something happened to me. Emily, or mom as I call her most often, would be put in charge of caring for Ryder, as his most involved family member. I also had him sign a post nuptial agreement that we each leave with what our names are on, and we take half of the accounts with both our names, and documentations with balances for those accounts was submitted to give a number since he hadn't moved any money around yet. Thank God Mom came with me to meet him for lunch, keeping him distracted while signing all those important documents on the short twenty minutes I know he gets.
Going to suck to be him in a day or two.
Mom had finally admitted she and Jefferson were a thing, and thinking of tying the knot in Vegas. They'd both been married before and it hadn't worked out. They were both in their fifties, and Jefferson said he already sees me as his daughter, and nobody messes with family. I would not want to be Matthew or Karen any time soon. With all the evidence against them for the affair, the hidden accounts he had in my name, the post-nup he signed and Jefferson filed, it was shaping up for me. Jefferson was planning on filing first thing Monday morning, which, looking at the clock was in three hours. I was working from home today, which was basically just code for me getting to stay home to Mom and the movers can move me and Ryder into her spare rooms for now. The divorce papers were being filed as soon as the courthouse opened today. Jefferson, being in law for decades, had made a few friends in the filing offices and they've been keeping an eye out for anything that Sullivan would try to push through so we could be the team to file first.
Laying in bed in the guest room, I can Ryder snoring in his room, our doors slightly open so we can hear each other. It's something we started doing more and more when Matthew wouldn't come home. It was a comfort to us to know the other could hear. Something about hearing his little snoring could usually always lull me to sleep, but tonight I was wired. I was wide awake. I'd spent the last two days helping get Stormi out of her house. Mom's girls were just falling apart at the seams it seemed. Stormi said she'd let us know when she gets where she's going. I know she'll be fine. I just hope that her ex leaves her alone. f-cking her sister? Her twin sister?! I put my arm over my face, willing myself not to think about it again.
Men suck.
They all suck.
All of them except Jefferson who is killing it with my mom. Now that her relationship is out, the happiness I see on her face all the time is wonderful. Jefferson might be busy though, because between my divorce case, he may also have to step in if Jason shows up at work again. Mom told him kindly enough today. But tomorrow is a different story. I lay in bed, trying to pinpoint in my marriage, where it shifted. Was it sudden? Was it subtle? Is that why I didn't notice? Why I didn't see the signs? Or what I just stupidly blinded by love?
Looking back...it had been years since we were close. Probably at least four years since we were close, and the last two he'd really been pulling away from me. He'd been traveling for work more, which, looking back, is a joke. What real estate agent needed to go to monthly, weekend-long seminars? And weekend-long, conventions? God. I'm such a f-cking idiot. He started slowly pulling away. I don't honestly remember the last time we were intimate.
It's been that long.
As I lay in bed, wondering if I qualify to be a nun since I was swearing off all men, hadn't had intercourse in so long I didn't remember, and was willing to never get tangled up in something like matters of the heart again. Never again. My phone dinged, pulling me from my thoughts.
Jefferson: Just filed. Had a filing friend going in early. He happens to be a bridge player who came over last night. Seems your case will be the first to go through this week. Also, the first to go out this afternoon. Can we have everything packed by then?
Raven: You betcha! Not too much to pack. I'm only taking what I bought, or came with. If we have video evidence of my stuff being...used...I want compensation for me.
Jefferson: Noted. I'll have the PI start going over everything.
Raven: I have the Uhaul set to be picked up in two hours. He'll be at work by then so we can start right away.
Jefferson: Good. I'll meet you girls at noon. Tell your mother I love her.
Raven: Gross. Tell her yourself.
Jefferson: LOL
They're so cute its gross. Absolutely adorably disgusting. I both love and hate it. Deciding that now was as good as any time to get up, I did. I went through my morning routine, made breakfast for myself, mom and Ryder. We were dropping Ryder off at a friend's house for the day. He has questions for me every day, and they're getting harder to give answers to. I don't want to alienate him from his dad, but I also don't know how to lie to him. I promised myself, and him, the day he was born I'd always maintain an honest relationship with him. So, when your eight-year-old asks, 'why aren't we living at home?' or 'are you and dad getting divorced?' I hate not knowing how to answer those.
I want to tell that we're going through this because his dad is a selfish prick who wants to f-ck his boss and spend all his time with her. That it's where he's been for the last few years. Thank God this PI was thorough. He'd managed to dig up our whole marriage. Thankfully this was his only stepping out. Unfortunately, he stepped out. Five years ago. It started out as an emotional affair. It didn't get physical until four years ago. It all hurts to know he was living a totally different life. One without Ryder and I. And I didn't know how to tell all of that to my son, who only wanted answers. I knew I had to give the age appropriate one, so I'd simply told him, ""Dad loves you buddy. But he and I want different things. Dad wants to see other people, and I don't. So, we won't be living together any more. But you now have two rooms! And you get time with just mom or just dad!"" I plastered a smile on my face, trying to make it seem like the coolest thing in the world. He didn't seem convinced.
""It'll be okay bud. Things always play out how they're supposed to."" I said, hugging him to my side, k-ssing him on the top of his head.",1,1740438152.0,novelsfree,3,1.0,False

I was at the airport, and it was morning so the line was very busy. I ordered a decaf flat white like normal, then when I went to collect it, the barista got confused and told me that my order was one decaf and one normal flat white. Then I said I only ordered one decaf, but the one with my name was not so she gave me the one with someone else‚Äôs name on it, ‚ÄúCarl‚Äù, and said ‚Äútake this one instead because it‚Äôs decaf‚Äù. And I asked if she knew how much I was charged for it, and she told me to check my mobile banking. I said I don‚Äôt have mobile banking, and then the convo ended, she ignored me and went back to making coffees. 

I understand it was a busy morning so I don‚Äôt blame her for prioritizing making other coffees. So I went back to the line to ask the cashier how much I was charged for it. When I got up to the counter, I encountered a very negative interaction. I asked if she can check how much I was charged for it, and then she said that she can‚Äôt, and started to blame me because I had someone else‚Äôs name on my cup. I explained that the barista specifically told me to take ‚ÄúCarl‚Äôs‚Äù cup since the order had come through as two and mine had caffeine in it. She did not believe me, and kept on insisting that I mistakenly took someone else‚Äôs cup. All throughout this interaction the other barista is ignoring us, although I am referring to her. 

In the end, the cashier didn‚Äôt check but said ‚ÄúI only charged you for one everything‚Äôs fine‚Äù, but I felt like I did something wrong by asking a question. Was I being a Karen? I‚Äôm a student and I don‚Äôt wanna be charged for two coffees especially when even one cup costs $5. Worst part is the coffee tasted burnt and horrible anyway. 

At this point, I didn‚Äôt really care if I was charged for two but I left the line feeling embarrassed and like I did something bad, and everyone behind me was watching.

1ixfolv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ixfolv,ECM Classika II x Geisinger temperature sensor,"Hello coffee folks,

I decided to share some observations after 2 weeks of using Geisinger group-head thermometer in my 10 months old ECM Classika II. It‚Äôs a single boiler E61 machine with PID. Probably my observations will be also useful for similar machines.

First of all I had a very positive experience buying a Geisinger thermometer. I am located in Poland so the easiest way was ordering directly from Germany. Contact with support, order, payment, fast shipping. All perfect. Thermometer was very well packed and installation was straight forward.

Here is what I have already discovered thanks to the thermometer:
1. My machine needs approximately 40 minutes to fully heat-up. Of course, the brew boiler has 92-93 degrees after 10 minutes, but the group-head remains cold. After 40 minutes reaches 87-88 degrees and that is a full heat-up. 

2. An accurate PID setting in my case needs a 12 degrees offset (setting E1 in service menu). That gives almost 1:1 between boiler temp and group-head temp. It slightly changes over different beans, but no more than 1 degree.

3. After milk steaming the machine requires a 40 second flush thru group-head to lower temperature back to 88-90 degrees. I can also skip flushing. Then it takes around 12-13 minutes to cool it down. 

Hope that it might be useful for other control freaks like me ü§ì.",3,1740437799.0,espresso,1,0.81,False

1. the card arrives with NO instructions.  Just a note that it will be my wallet's best friend.
2. So with no instructions on activating or setting a PIN I head out to a coffee shop to make sure it's working.  First declined payment
3. log onto the website and don't see anything more
4. log into the phone app and see that I have to activate it AND set a PIN.  That ends with a message saying I should go to a store and insert it into a POS maching to sync the  PIN.  I do that at three different merchants and get 2nd - 4th declined payment.
5. I phone WS and wait on hold & get transferred to 2 different groups.  2nd one gets me I have to reset my PIN and then go to an ATM to sync it.  I phone the number and head to a bank.  Insert the card, enter my PIN and request my balance.  Seems to work.
6. go to a coffee shop and make a successful purchase by tapping.  So I still don't know if the PIN works for purchases???

This seems like the instructions could be a lot clearer.

My wife just received her card and we CAREFULLY read every prompt in the app and confirm that there is no mention of needing to go to an ATM.

YMMV (and hopefully does).

A week before he broke up with me I told him he was my soulmate and he answered that I was his soulmate too. We were together for a year and a half, we also lived together abroad for few months. We were really really close and before that we were friends for half a year. He told me he was going to text me soon as his final words after breaking up with me . We didn‚Äôt talked for two months (no contact that we never talked or agreed too, he just never reached out to me, even for new year and I never broke no contact because I was too proud ) and we run into each other few times ( we are in the same school) we had each time different really weird interactions. The first time we run into each other he was with a friend and he just  made a joke to me, not even asking if I‚Äôm okay, then one time he was really distant not a single word, not even a wave. A month and half ago we run into each other again at an event and we are doing the classic we don‚Äôt see each other until we are forced to be face to face in the hallway and we started to chat casually , he‚Äôs friends started to pressure him cause they wanted to go and he  asked me if I wanted to grab coffee some time. And added let‚Äôs text soon and I said : no you text me. I also told him that I thought we would never speak again and he looked at me and said something like this is absurd. Then we run into each other again later on and he said to me that he was about to text me, that he was so happy to see me, then he starts to be flirty and complimenting me, we have a really good time and we are talking about the coffee that we are going to have and how fun it‚Äôs going to be, he seems so excited about my projects ect‚Ä¶ I felt like I was high or something cause the spark and the excitement was so present. And then nothing. I waited the whole week end and nothing I know that he asked about me to common friends few times, to know how I have been doing  but I also know that he says to everyone that he‚Äôs detached, that he doesn‚Äôt regret his decision and everyone told me that he seems really happy alone and single.
He was visiting one of my really good friend that we have in common when he went abroad and after 5 min of seeing her he asked about me, he told her that we met and he told her about my words ; I thought we were never going to talk to each other again, and he said that he was super confused about that, my friend told him that maybe it‚Äôs because he never reached out, and he said that he did that for me.  
Few weeks ago we run into each other at school and he comes near me to say hi, and I decided that I didn‚Äôt want to be close to him physically so I stepped back. He seems super shocked and didn‚Äôt  say a word. Next day he calls one of our common friends and ask her why do I behaved like this, why I was ignoring him then she told him that I knew about some rumours (I heard about gossips at school that he‚Äôs really detached and also that apparently he was saying that I was a nice story during our exchange abroad but that was it, nothing really important.) he got super mad to my friend, saying that he never said that ect ‚Ä¶. But also told her that he moved on, that he was happy single, that we broke up 3 months ago and he moved on. 
He then reached out to me super coldly saying that he wanted to see me, saying that it was important and asked me if I was at school the same day. I didn‚Äôt answered cause I was taking my time (he then call my friend to know why I was not answering) and I was super hurt by the gossips, then he texted me again asking if we could see each other the next day or if he could call me. I then answered asking what he wanted to talk about and he said nothing special just that he did not wanted to talk by texts. I asked if it was really important and he did not  answered. 
Then  few days ago, two weeks after him not answering my last text, we were at the same concert and we ignored each other like we don‚Äôt knew each other. After the show a friend of mine asked him how he was felling about me and he said that he was happy with his decision. That he did not regretted it, he made the right choice, he was happy single but he said that it was really painful for him and complicated the whole situation post break up  between us and he told her that he thought that I was hating him and he was offended by my last text.
He texted me two days ago in the morning saying this : ‚ÄúI still think we should see each other when you have the time and feel like it. If that‚Äôs not the case, I understand and won‚Äôt bother you with it anymore. Have a good day!‚Äù
Few hours later he called the same common friend of last time, she did not answered but probably he was calling her to know why I was not replying.
I haven‚Äôt answered yet cause I‚Äôm terrified to see him, I‚Äôm afraid that he would break my heart again.
