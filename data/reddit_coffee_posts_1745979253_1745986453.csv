1kb7p3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1kb7p3a/in_person_it_feels_like_something_but_in_between/,"In person, it feels like something… but in between, it feels like nothing. (22F/25M)","Hey folks,
I’m here to share something that’s been emotionally confusing for me, and I’d appreciate your thoughts. I (22F) recently got to know this guy (25M) through a mutual friend (34F). Things started out unexpectedly sweet—he found out it was my birthday, called me that night, and insisted on joining me for coffee. We ended up talking till 4 AM. I felt seen, appreciated, and enjoyed the spontaneity.

A few days later, I was stuck in the rain and contacted him to ask about transport options. He invited me over for coffee, and again, we had long, meaningful conversations. Eventually, we spent more time together—after dinners at our mutual friend's place and then him asking me out. Things progressed slowly, and we shared intimate moments and lots of laughter.

But then, it got confusing. We had plans one evening, and he suddenly asked for space because he had a lot on his mind. I respected that. Since then, he’s become distant—he doesn’t initiate texts, barely asks about my day, and when I do reach out, the chats feel surface-level. Yet, every time we’re in person, it feels warm and easy, like we’re completely in sync.

I finally brought it up on a call, expressing how hard it is to understand the shift between his in-person warmth and his distant communication. He admitted he’s difficult, tends to take things slow, and has pushed people away in the past. I told him clearly: if there’s nothing he wants from this, I’d rather know than stay stuck in a cycle of push and pull. He agreed, appreciated my honesty, and said he didn’t want me confused.

However, I tried making dinner plans after this, and he postponed them. I let it go, but he didn’t bring them up again the next day. I texted late at night just to check if he was feeling better—he’d been unwell earlier—but again, nothing much.

So now I’m here—feeling like I’m doing all the work emotionally. I’m willing to invest in someone, but I can’t be the only one showing up. And if this is how it starts, I fear how draining it might be in the long run.

Has anyone navigated a similar dynamic early on? How do you tell the difference between someone emotionally unavailable and someone who’s just a slow starter? How do you know when to step back?

""Who am I when it is not yet my turn in life?"" Twenty-six years old, and the world around me seems to be hitting fast forward. Engagements, baby showers, promotions that feel light years away – it’s a relentless reel of milestones I haven’t reached. Sometimes, in the quiet hum of my laptop after a long day of chasing deadlines, a wave of unease washes over me. Am I just…waiting? Existing in the in-between?

But then I look around my small but fiercely independent room, at the overflowing bookshelves filled with stories I want to write, at the worn-out yoga mat that grounds me. This isn't waiting. This is building. This is the quiet, persistent work of laying the foundation for that elusive ""turn."" It might not be the dazzling spotlight, but it's the steady burn of passion, the grit in my teeth as I learn and grow. Maybe this in-between isn't an empty space at all. Maybe it's the forge where the ""me"" who's ready for that turn is being carefully, deliberately crafted.

1kb7nxa,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingHawaii/comments/1kb7nxa/big_island_itinerary_planning_advice/,Big Island Itinerary Planning Advice,"I am getting married right after Christmas, and we are planning to honeymoon on the Big Island. I have been to Kauai, but this will be my fiancée's first time in Hawaii. We are appreciators of nature, culture, and food, but more inclined to a farm tour or a zoo than strenuous hike (if said hike could alternatively be called a nature walk, we are on board).

 We have 9 nights which I plan to split between Hilo and Kona/Waikoloa. 

* 4 nights at the SCP Hilo - others have recommended the Grand Naniloa, but recent reviews are bad. We don't need anything fancy (in fact would like to save money on this portion) but would like a clean, comfortable room and a pool.
* 5 nights at Westin Hapuna or Fairmont Orchid - each seem to have pros and cons, but it sounds like the Orchid is nicer overall, you're just sacrificing an adults-only pool and the bigger, better beach. Is that right?
* Also considering Volcano House or another property in Volcano village in place of a Hilo night - is that worth it? My fiancée doesn't really want to change hotels more than once. Otherwise we would do a day in VNP from Hilo. Would we get bored if we stay here instead of Hilo for 4 nights?

Other questions...

* I love coffee. I would love to go on multiple coffee tours, but my fiancée isn't a coffee drinker. Which one (or optimistically two) should I prioritize, and which would be most enjoyable for a non-coffee snob who would appreciate nature and/or other tour components? Are there other coffees I should try to buy that don't have a good tour?
* I want to limit windey road driving because my fiancée is prone to carsickness. Will we have trouble going to VNP from Hilo? Any other routes to avoid? Trying to be strategic to avoid backtracking or excess switchbacks and curves.
* If you had one splurge dinner on the island, where would you go?
* I would love any recommendations for farm tours, animal encounters, gardens, flowers, unique experiences. Boat time will also be limited due to the aforementioned motion sickness.",2,1745986169.0,VisitingHawaii,0,1.0,False

Want to plan a second meetup before I go but don’t want to be to pushy,"Hey all,

So, looking for some advice. I really don’t want to come off as too pushy or overbearing with this girl.

I (20M) DM’ed her (18F) off IG and we messaged for a few days and then we met up for coffee on Sunday. It went really well I think. We met for three hours and ended up going for lunch. Afterward, I told her to message me when she gets home. She did message me, but to tell me she didn’t make it home just yet because she popped in at the mall. I told her she should have told me cause I would totally gone with her, but maybe that it was a good idea because I’d spend money. She said we should definitely go sometime. 

It sucks because I actually leave for a three week trip on Friday! I feel like we definitely hit it off, it’s just the timing, as I’ll be gone for three weeks (or I wouldn’t be so antsy).

I then suggested Tuesday we should go bowling and she replied she’s totally down. I messaged her yesterday just to check-in and she said she may have to cancel it reschedule our bowling night as she was having a really rough day. I told her no worries. I messaged her today just to see how she’s doing and she said that she’s a bit better but not really feeling up for bowling today. I again said it’s no problem, but that I’d love to try and see her again before I head off on my trip. She mentioned that if we aren’t able to meet up before Friday she’s down to hear all about my trip when I get back. Which I think is a good sign?

I just don’t know how to reply lol. Like do I tomorrow ask if she’s free? Is that to much? Wait until Thursday and ask? Leave it fully with her and just say to let me know if she ends up being free tomorrow or Thursday and leave it at that? Suggest maybe just going for dinner? I hate these games and overthinking lol.

Maybe I just need to take a step back. I don’t want to come off too pushy or anything or just be chasing. But, I actually found her profile on Tinder and Bumble so I know she’s looking lol. I don’t wanna miss my chance or fumble by being to overbearing or something. She’s uber my type and we’re from a similar community. 

What do yall suggest? Leave it for now and message her either tomorrow or Thursday asking if she’s free? Just put the ball in her court and say let me know if she’s free tomorrow or Thursday to do something and leave it at that? Idk lol. I don’t want to just be chasing, I feel like that gives girls the “ick.” I’m trying to work on not moving to quickly and being to obsessive or “nice guy” so I put is appreciated on how to move forward. Do I just leave it till I come back? I mean I’d like to try and see her but idk lol, I don’t want to be begging or anything crazy cause fuck that. ",0,1745985944.0,Manipulation,0,0.5,False

ive had been fighting with it for so long and i felt sooo stupid, but then i looked harder at the writting from Ilmo and i finally cracked it, the original game text says ""Tracker, Lookout, Cleaner"" wich in spanish would be ""Rastreador, Vigia, Limpiador"", but thats not what it says at all in the HUD translated text, translated back to english it says ""Trace, Lake, Clear"", NO WONDER i was never going to figure the damn puzzle if the translation was completely wrong ! haha, i never noticed because i usually read the HUD text since the actual text on the textures can be dark or just too small.

i wonder hoy many people playing this game who dont speak english at all will fare and how quickly will they resort to just googling the number, maybe if someone at Remedy is reading this (i love you and great work btw) this could be used as a heads up of sorts, its probably tough to translate from finnish to english and then to spanish and such and such, so its understandable, but kind of a big deal for things like these, a main quest puzzle and all, thats all, much love.",2,1745985916.0,AlanWake,0,1.0,False

Someone had commented that they had survived by romanticizing the fuck out of grad school (I.e. listening to lofi, going to coffee shops and stuff to do work, etc). And idk why, but that mindset of all things really helped. Personally, I really love the Zelda games, and putting on some Zelda ambience videos while I sit at my desk to do work has been the main reason I’ve been able to focus and somewhat enjoy doing work this semester! Plus this semester I started TAing (and I’m wanting to be a teacher), so I think that helped as well.

All of this is to say, if you are like me and you were debating dropping out of grad school because your adhd was making everything 100x more difficult and miserable, there are ways to cope! Whether that be meds, apps to read papers out loud, how you reward yourself (I made myself a virtual sticker notebook for completing difficult tasks!), or putting a relaxing video on while you do work.

Throw away, shortened for character count.

For context, I have been married to my husband for just over 20 years. We started dating when my stepkids were 5 and 3. Our kids are: Adam (28, stepkid #1), Ben (26, stepkid #2), Charles (20), David (17), and Ellie (13).

Adam is getting married at the end of summer to his fiancé Alice (27). We have all been very excited for them. All of the kids have roles for the wedding, Charles is the best man, the other two boys are groomsman, and Ellie is a jr bridesmaid.

Last weekend we had a dinner for my husband’s birthday, all of the kids attended along with Alice. The topic of the wedding came up again, and this is where it started to go downhill. Ellie brought up that she was SO excited to go dress shopping and that we planned to go to a bigger city in a few weeks to get her a dress and me a stepmom of the groom dress.

At that, Alice looked at Adam sideways and responded that we only needed to worry about one dress, Ellie’s. Ellie kind of laugh and said “what are you expecting mom to wear? A suit?”. Alice responded with “(My name) isn’t going. You know we are keeping our guest list very limited to only family and a few close friends.” WHAT. Adam and Alice have been to our house numerous times for holidays, dinners, just to say hi since they’ve been engaged, this has never been brought up.

Pretty quickly things escalated. The cliff notes version is that Charles asked them to clarify if they were choosing to uninvite me now or if I was never invited. Alice confirmed the latter. why? Adam said it’s because I’m not his mom. Charles, David, and Ellie argued with Adam and Alice that none of them were going to go if I wasn’t invited. That it was cruel to leave me out given I’ve been his parent for a majority of his life and loved him like my own. My husband and I admittedly sat there for a minute just fucking shocked.

Adam finally turned to my husband and said, “well?” My husband told him he wouldn’t be going either. Adam then turned to me and asked if I was really going to let everyone ruin his wedding on my behalf. Here’s where I might be the asshole: I just laughed. Idk what came over me but the entire thing was just so ridiculous that laughing was the only thing I could get out. I told my husband I’d be waiting in the car and left. And then promptly bawled my eyes out.

Anyways, Charles, David and Ellie are not talking to Adam. Adam called my husband yesterday to try and smooth things over. He was still adamant I’m not invited and it’s their wedding. He also requested I apologize for laughing at him. My husband told him tough shit. It’s their wedding and they can invite whoever they want, but they cant control who will actually go. He said THEY owe ME an apology and that Adam should be ashamed of himself.

I’m getting texts now asking wtf I did and why I’m being a “stepmonster and ruining the wedding” AITA?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: I feel like there's a lot missing here. You've been married to his dad since he was 8. That was years of elementary, middle, high school, college. 20 years. Is his mother living? Did his fiance influence him? Just seems odd to not invite his dad's wife of 20 years and call her not family. I don't think you're TA, but I just want to know more about the past 20 years

>**OOP:** I am sorry, I had to cut out a lot for the character count to post. When Adam called, my husband did ask him if I had done anything, if it was related to bio mom (she has never gotten along with us), if I had overstepped in any way. Adam says no, it’s just they want family only. Stepdad is invited as far as we know.  
I was a SAHM for most of my stepkids childhood and we had 50/50. My husband has always worked a lot but has been as involved as possible, the house and child rearing mostly fell to me though. I love our kids to pieces. I thought we had made it clear from the beginning that I am/was another parent that loves them, not a replacement mom.  
We’ve never had any issues and I thought up until now that we were particularly close. Our communication has slowed since he met Alice but he was calling me about once or twice a week prior to this. Alice and I have gone shopping on occasion, gotten lunch, I even went with her to the florist for the wedding because her mom wasn’t available and Adam got called into work. There has to be something/someone causing an issue and my husband and I are baffled

Commenter: Is his mom invited?

>**OOP:** Yes, as far as we’ve heard stepdad is also invited. We (my husband and I) have never gotten along with mom but still play nice as we still have 50/50 of younger stepson (Ben).  
Adam and his mom had a falling out a few years ago as she was starting to treat him the way she’s always treated husband and I, that is, poorly. (Idk how to nicely explain other than she’s a narcissist.) Adam hasn’t wanted to talk about it much and we won’t push it. I know they talk and visit still but how close they are, I have no idea.

Commenter: Absolutely NTA. Assuming you and Adam have gotten along fine until now it’s absolutely wild that they wouldn’t invite you. “Only family and a few close friends” when a stepparent literally counts as family, and the nerve to accuse you of ruining his wedding, I don’t blame you for laughing.

>**OOP:** It’s probably also relevant but my husbands parents are long since deceased. My parents (dad, stepmom, and mom) have been very involved with all of the kids since they were little. They are also not going since if I am not family, they aren’t either. My brother & SIL, their daughter, my cousin (they call him uncle), and several of my other family members that have been around since stepkids were little have also dropped. They are up to like 20 people they have rescinded their yes rsvp for a wedding of maybe 60 people

Commenter: Wait hold up, your family was invited but not you? Then what the hell did Adam expect when it came out you're not invited.

>**OOP:** That’s my family’s take, why are they invited but I’m not? They arent related to my stepkids by blood either but are apparently “family”? To be fair, my family is larger than my husbands, step dads, and bio moms. My stepkids were the first grandkids on my side (they were not with bio mom and dad’s families) and were absolutely spoiled rotten growing up.  
Charles is now supposed to meet Adam for coffee over the weekend, I’ve warned him that truly I don’t think it’s coming from Adam and to try to calm about it.

Commenter: INFO: what is the nature of your relationship with Adam? is his mother in the picture? could his fiancé be in his ear? \[...\]

>**OOP:** I thought we were particularly close, besides the normal teenager “I don’t have to listen to you” bs phase we have never fought. We’ve always had him and Ben 50/50, as a teen and on he’s butted heads with his mother. There have been times over the years where Adam had come to my husband and I and asked questions from things his mom has said, but we’ve always been forthcoming with info.  
(Ex of that is that his mom called me a homewrecker. This upset adam, adam came pissed at us. Explained that no, biomom and dad were long since broken up and mom even had a fiance who was not current stepdad when I met dad. Pulled receipts. Adam upset with mom. Blew over and onto the next thing.) We still deal with biomom though and I do have a hard time believing she’d pull something at this point.  
Alice and I arent super close but I thought had a good relationship. I have always tried to include her, sometimes she takes up my offer and sometimes she doesn’t. I know she sees bio mom quite a bit and that side of Adam’s family too, she was raised by her grandparents and does not talk about bio parents often.

Commenter: How did Ben react to this? At this point I probably would not go to the wedding and would block his and his FW. They would have to grovel in order to go. They made it clear they don't see you as family so you don't need to do anything for them going forward.

>**OOP:** Ben was very upset and confused. He is autistic so what exactly the argument about doesn’t quite click, but he’s mostly upset Adam says I’m not their parent and his siblings are all fighting.  
We’ve sat him down since and explained that I love him dearly and will never go anywhere, all of us love Adam and are just hurt, and that he himself can choose to go to the wedding or not. He doesn’t have to choose sides and we will still love him if he goes (honestly he probably will, he loves cake and dancing lol.) He seems to be doing just fine since. He hasn’t asked about Adam but will go to his mom’s tomorrow and probably see him there.

*More info on everyone's relationships:*

>It was hard to include every bit of context in the post because of the character limit, but I quit my job when Charles was 6 months old. (Adam would have been 8, almost 9.) No affair. I met my husband when he’d been divorced for over a year, bio mom was engaged to someone else.  
If you ask their bio mom, she’ll say I’ve always overstepped. If you ask her how, she’ll give examples like i went to school events (so did stepdad), I helped with homework, I spent too much time with them. She would thank me for “loving her kids so much” and then turn around and berate my husband for me “loving kids that aren’t hers too much”. Another example is that in the beginning she wanted to communicate with me directly more. Said she loved the communication and that I was easier to deal with than my husband. Next argument with my husband she brought up that I was weird and too involved and she shouldn’t have to talk to me whatsoever. I haven’t talked to her since. Periodically she has brought up that I was easier to talk to and she doesn’t understand why communication just has to go through my husband. After several years of trying to appease her, we quit to just focus on keeping our family happy and supported. It’s been 23 years now of dealing with her, I’ve been to therapy multiple times to resolve whatever issues she says I have (it did help with strategies to deal with her). Truly it’s just that she has mental issues.  
Their dad did work a lot, he has always been on nights. It’s changed slightly over the years but we had stepkids Friday, Saturday, Sunday, every other Monday. His days off have always fell over those days so he can spend the max amount of time with them, but usually he worked 1-2 of those nights. Very rarely would he work OT on days we had my stepkids, usually on days we didn’t. We still currently try to do dates on days when Ben is not with us. I hope that makes sense and clears up some questions for you.

Commenter: Are Alice’s parents still together? Has she assumed you’re some kind of evil stepmother? Does she have a bad relationship with her stepmom and doesn’t want to invite her?

>**OOP:** Her “mom and dad” are her grandparents, she hasn’t talked about it much with me specifically but her bio mom is deceased (drugs) and her bio father’s in prison. She’s talked about it some with my husband, who was adopted by his aunt and uncle (father not in the picture and mother died from cancer when he was 4). My stepmom has also talked with her at one point because she too was adopted by her grandparents for similar reasons. It just adds to our confusion, we have such a mix of types of family regardless of blood that. My MIL has been laying it on thick that I need to smooth things over because “family is family” and I’m the parent so it’s my responsibility to fix it. But fuck. I’m not ready to talk to Adam.  
*edit:*  
Sorry, my MOTHER lol. My MIL is deceased.

*One more thought from OOP in response to a longer* [Comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1k2fl3c/comment/mnujzhq/?context=3):

>Thank you for your thoughtful comment. Adam will always be my first son, whether he thinks of me as his mom or not. I thought we had been pretty clear throughout the years that I love him, regardless of what he thinks of me, and that my involvement extends to whatever he wants of me and some fair nonnegotiables (mostly safety things, chores his dad agreed on when I asked, that kind of thing).  
I couldn’t get in with my therapist this week but I do have an appointment next week, and we will try to formulate a well thought out response back. I am certainly not a perfect person or parent but I won’t intentionally sabotage him further. I do love a good revenge story but that’s not it when it comes to my kids.  
I’ve talked to the youngest three and they have reassured me that it’s their choice whether or not they go, and I wont push them on it. I have been reminding them that he is still their brother and it doesn’t sound like him (mostly for Charles, he is very outspoken and protective). Charles is supposed to meet with him this weekend and I’m hoping we’ll get some clearer answers from that.

**Update** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/user/Afraid_Mammoth_5574/comments/1k6j2qb/update_aita_for_laughing_at_my_stepson_and/)**: April 23, 2025 (5 days later)**

Hi Reddit friends, my update was taken down by AITA for not having a good enough conclusion but I do have an update. I had to condense it a lot for AITA but I’m going to just copy and paste it here.

Thank you to everyone who responded to my post, most of you were kind and offered good advice. I appreciate it.

Before I give an update I just want to answer a few frequently asked questions.

1. I am not an affair partner. My husband did not cheat on his ex wife with me, we met about a year after they divorced. She was already engaged (not to current stepdad), not that that really matters.
2. Ben was at the dinner, he is autistic. I went into it more in some of my comments, but he was very upset. He doesn’t understand what the argument was exactly about but he was mostly upset at Adam for saying I’m not their parent and then at all the siblings for fighting with each other.

Anyways, the update. The short is: if you guessed it was related to biomom, you were correct. I didn’t want this to be the case.

Adam rescheduled with Charles for Monday, citing Easter weekend (fair enough). He also texted my husband to let him know that him and Alice would be doing Easter with her parents (we expected that). At some point on Sunday, Ellie texted Alice. I am not sure what exactly was said, but it prompted Alice to spill everything that was going on with her parents. I have met them a few times but they live a few hours away. They encouraged her and Adam to reach out to us to clear everything up.

Monday we dropped Ben off to biomoms (he stayed an extra night for Easter fun). A few hours later, she began to blow up my husbands phone as Ben mentioned the fight. My husband answered one call in which she was screaming and promptly hung up. He texted her that the siblings argued, everything is fine, and that if Ben has any further questions we will talk about when he’s back with us. From some of the things she texted, we knew she was the root of all of this.

Monday Adam also met up with Charles, and he did come clean. Charles texted us to see if it was OK if they came over after and we said yes. I’m not going to lie, Adam looked a mess. He immediately began crying and apologizing. The short and sweet is that he’s been trying to mend bridges with bio mom. Their wedding isn’t 60 people, it’s blown up to about double that and they have been struggling to figure out how to pay for it. At one of their visits, Alice let it slip and bio mom jumped to help pay for things. It slowly snowballed from there from small requests to big requests. I am not sure what the final nail in the coffin was, but it ended with bio mom requesting I not be there. Adam said it was easier to hurt me and risk WW3 with his mom.

Alice’s parents were less than pleased to find out how they’ve been with the wedding/budget, and even less so at bio mom’s antics. They are trying to figure out how to start covering the payments bio mom has made (we’ve decided to help some with this). Adam also asked if we could meet again in a few days with Alice and we’ve said yes.

There is still a lot of ground to cover for this to be close to mended. I am still hurt but mostly, I’m angry on behalf of my oldest son.",15,1745985666.0,BestofRedditorUpdates,6,0.89,False

Nobody wants a leaky water bottle. Here’s how to maximize the leak-proof qualities of your Klean Kanteen:

*   **Proper Closure:** Ensure that the lid is securely tightened.*   **Inspect Seals:** Check the lid's seals and gaskets for damage. If they're worn or cracked, replace them.
   **Avoid Overfilling:** Overfilling the bottle can increase the risk of leakage.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/9htyKFhj6Q): **April 23, 2025**

Hi Reddit this happened earlier today and I’m still kind of stewing over it, so I need to know if I overreacted or if it was justified.

I (29F) was invited to a friend’s BBQ. My ex, *Jake* (30M), and I broke up about 2 years ago. It was mutual, we both agreed we weren’t right for each other long-term, and since we share a close friend group, we’ve stayed civil and occasionally see each other at gatherings. It’s usually fine.

Jake’s been dating *Sophie* (26F) for about 6 months. I don’t know her well, but every time we’ve been around each other, she seems to go out of her way to make little passive-aggressive jabs at me stuff like *“Wow, you’re still single? That’s brave.”* or *“Must be nice having so much free time without kids.”* I’ve always let it slide to avoid drama.

A bit more info; Even though we broke up, there’ve been multiple moments where it’s obvious Jake isn’t fully moved on. For one, he still finds excuses to text me random stuff, like sending memes or asking about old inside jokes we had. He’ll “accidentally” bring up memories from when we were together when we’re in a group, or mention songs and places that meant something to us.

On top of that, a few mutual friends have let slip that he’s told them he still has feelings, or at least isn’t fully over our relationship. Nothing inappropriate while he’s with Sophie (as far as I know), but it’s clear there are lingering feelings there and I think Sophie might sense it too, which is probably part of the reason she’s so weirdly hostile toward me.

Back to the story, today Sophie was at it again. Every time I was within earshot, she’d drop little digs like *“Some people just can’t move on, huh?”* or *“Guess it takes some people longer to grow up.”* I ignored it for hours.

But then toward the end of the night, she made another comment *“Well, not everyone can handle being in a healthy relationship.”* That was it for me.

I turned to her and said, *“You’re right it takes a special kind of person to date a guy still hung up on his ex.”*

It went dead silent. Sophie looked stunned, Jake looked beyond uncomfortable, and a couple of our friends awkwardly tried to change the subject. I left soon after because I didn’t want things to get worse.

She was making digs at me all night and I finally stood up for myself. But part of me feels like maybe I went too far by throwing that in her face even though it’s true. I never planned to use what Jake’s said/done like that, and now I wonder if I made it unnecessarily messy.

So Reddit… AITA for finally snapping at my ex’s girlfriend after constant passive-aggressive comments?

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA, she f’ked around and found out.

Also if she is so happy in her new relationship, she wouldn’t work so hard to bring another woman down.

**Commenter 2:** ""I don't think a healthy relationship involves one partner constantly making digs at their ex. Seems like you're a little *obsessed* there, sweetie.""

**Commenter 3:** NTA, but, but next time you could also ask what she means by that. That way you don’t have a dig yourself, but she has to publicly embarras herself. Just keep prodding until you get an answer. “No, you said: this and that. What do you mean by that, just help me understand” prodding. It’ll shut her up, without making you the bad guy.

**Commenter 4:** Was it the best way to handle the situation? Probably not. Could Sophie have been more civil? Absolutely.

There are a few things at play here. Literally, EVERYONE has sat there, in silence, while this brat makes constant digs at you. Silence is not neutrality. Silence is a free pass. Silence means they agree. So, for 6 months or so, all your friends allowed this BS to continue. At any given time your ex, any person in the group, literally anyone could have told her to drop the shit, it isn't cool, until she came along there was peace and she is single-handedly ruining it. Nobody said a word. Nobody tried to end the drama. This chick comes along and just stirs the pot while everyone watched. I bet my buttons that if Sophie had been saying stuff to or about another member of the group, that person would have been upset.

There is keeping the peace and there is this. Letting her run her mouth isn't keeping the peace, it's allowing a pick-me girl to run unchecked, because nobody in that group has got a spine. A real friend stands up for you. Both to your face and behind your back. None of these people are standing up for you. Not even when you are right there!!!

My best friends ex-husband got with his affair partner, publicly, after the split. I was working a short term gig as a bartender. The new woman would cone in, with my best friends ex and run her mouth about my bestie. Every single time she did, I gave her a single warning, stop it or I will refuse to serve you. Sometimes she stopped sometimes she got cut off. A few times she even got 86ed. Why? Because a friend is there for you, even if you are not around. Because a true friend doesn't let anyone put down, belittle, bully or even make constant passive-aggressive remarks.

Honestly, I have to say ESH, except OP. A person can only take so much before they snap. Your friend group sounds like a bunch of passive jellyfish. Nobody is going to be like that, to anyone I care about, in my presence.

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC/s/wgpldd0nB6): **April 23, 2025 (same day, 11 hours later)**

Hey again Reddit just wanted to post a quick update since a lot happened … well, I’m still kind of processing it, but it feels worth sharing.

So, after I left the BBQ (and posted), I got a flurry of texts from mutual friends mostly along the lines of “damn, that was awkward but also overdue.” Apparently, everyone noticed Sophie’s digs throughout the day, and more than one person told me they were surprised I lasted as long as I did before finally saying something.

Jake, for what it's worth, hasn’t said a single word to me. Not an apology, not a “hey, that was a lot,” nothing. Radio silence. But I did get a very long, very dramatic message from Sophie last night basically accusing me of “trying to sabotage her relationship” and calling me “emotionally manipulative.” (??)

I didn’t respond. I don’t see the point especially because here’s the kicker:

I’ve actually been seeing someone for a few months now. His name’s Daniel. He’s thoughtful, mature, low-drama, and most importantly, not still caught up on an ex. We’ve been keeping things fairly private while we found our footing, but last night after the chaos of the BBQ I posted a pic of us to the friend group chat. Just us smiling at a coffee shop. Totally normal.

Within the hour, Sophie left the chat.

Make of that what you will.

Anyway, Daniel has been incredibly supportive about everything and honestly, I think seeing that photo (and realizing that I have 100% moved on) was the final crack in whatever illusion Sophie was holding onto. One of our mutuals mentioned that things were “not going well” between her and Jake. Which… yeah. That tracks.

So yeah, I don’t feel bad about what I said anymore. Maybe I could’ve been softer, but sometimes the truth is sharp and people don’t like how it feels.

Thanks again for all the response reading through the comments really helped me feel like I wasn’t just being petty or reactive. I’m good now. Actually? I’m better than good.

And Daniel brings me coffee and emotional security, so that’s a win.

**Top Comments**

**Commenter 1:** I’m glad your friends are on your side. Sophie is pathetic. I’m so curious how your ex will react to the news of Daniel.

**Commenter 2:** It wasn't fair of Sophie to take out her frustrations on you. At least, they're now dealing with it.

**Commenter 3:** She probably thought that you were the one sending him mixed signals and the reason he was kinda flip flopping.

The picture have shown that it was all him. (Maybe as opposed to what he was telling her)

So she had no reason to stay with him.

Or maybe she was only there as a friend to try to make you jealous and come back to him?

So, looking for some advice. I really don’t want to come off as too pushy or overbearing with this girl.

I DM’ed her off IG and we messaged for a few days and then we met up for coffee on Sunday. It went really well I think. We met for three hours and ended up going for lunch. Afterward, I told her to message me when she gets home. She did message me, but to tell me she didn’t make it home just yet because she popped in at the mall. I told her she should have told me cause I would totally gone with her, but maybe that it was a good idea because I’d spend money. She said we should definitely go sometime. 

It sucks because I actually leave for a three week trip on Friday! I feel like we definitely hit it off, it’s just the timing, as I’ll be gone for three weeks (or I wouldn’t be so antsy).

I then suggested Tuesday we should go bowling and she replied she’s totally down. I messaged her yesterday just to check-in and she said she may have to cancel it reschedule our bowling night as she was having a really rough day. I told her no worries. I messaged her today just to see how she’s doing and she said that she’s a bit better but not really feeling up for bowling today. I again said it’s no problem, but that I’d love to try and see her again before I head off on my trip. She mentioned that if we aren’t able to meet up before Friday she’s down to hear all about my trip when I get back. Which I think is a good sign?

I just don’t know how to reply lol. Like do I tomorrow ask if she’s free? Is that to much? Wait until Thursday and ask? Leave it fully with her and just say to let me know if she ends up being free tomorrow or Thursday and leave it at that? Suggest maybe just going for dinner? I hate these games and overthinking lol.

# MITOLYN Review: The Supplement That Gave Me My Life Back

I never planned to write a long review about a supplement. But MITOLYN isn’t just another pill in a pretty bottle. It’s the first thing I’ve tried that actually made me feel like I was back in control of my own energy. If you’re sick of feeling tired, foggy, or just “blah” all the time, I hope my experience helps you decide if MITOLYN could be right for you.

# 🧠 The Life I Was Living Before MITOLYN

Let me be real with you. My mornings started with groaning at my alarm, hitting snooze ten times, and dragging myself to the kitchen for coffee. I felt like a zombie—even after eight hours of sleep. My brain was foggy, and I’d forget simple things, like where I put my keys or what I was supposed to do next. Work was a struggle. I felt cranky for no reason, and my muscles ached like I’d run a marathon (even though I barely exercised).

Friends thought I was lazy, and doctors said my blood work was “fine.” But I knew something wasn’t right. I felt much older than I was, and every day felt like walking through molasses. I wanted to feel like myself again, so I started reading about how our cells make energy. That’s when I learned about mitochondria—the “batteries” inside our cells. When they slow down, everything else slows down too. That’s where MITOLYN came into my life.

# ⚡ What is MITOLYN and Why Is It So Powerful?

MITOLYN is a supplement designed to boost your energy from the inside out by helping your mitochondria work better. It isn’t just a quick fix or a “sugar rush” like energy drinks. Instead, it’s made with a mix of ingredients that are backed by real science and help your cells make more energy, fight off damage, and keep you feeling young.

Here’s what’s inside MITOLYN that makes it different:

- **CoQ10 (Ubiquinol):** This is a super important part of how your cells make energy. Think of it like the oil in your car engine.
- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** This helps your body make new mitochondria—so you have more “batteries” in your cells!
- **Acetyl L-Carnitine:** Helps bring healthy fuel into your cells, so you get clean, steady energy.
- **Alpha Lipoic Acid:** Protects your cells from getting damaged and helps other vitamins work better.
- **Resveratrol:** You might have heard this is in red wine. It helps keep your cells young and healthy.

MITOLYN doesn’t just cover up tiredness. It actually helps your body work better from the ground up.

# 🔥 My First Month on MITOLYN: A Total Transformation

When I first started taking MITOLYN, I wasn’t expecting miracles. I just wanted to feel a little better. I took two capsules each morning with my breakfast.

The first few days, I didn’t notice much. But by the end of the first week, I realized I wasn’t yawning all day. I woke up without feeling like a train had hit me during the night. My brain started to clear up—I could focus at work, finish my tasks, and actually remember what I was doing.

By the second week, the afternoon slump that used to hit me like a wall? Completely gone. I wasn’t reaching for extra coffee or snacks to keep going. I even had the energy to go for a walk after work (something I hadn’t done in months).

By the end of the month, I felt like I had new batteries inside me. My mood was better. My skin looked brighter. I even started enjoying family time again, because I wasn’t just thinking about napping. MITOLYN didn’t just give me back my energy—it gave me back my motivation, my confidence, and my joy.

# 💪 Why MITOLYN Works When Other Supplements Fail

So why did MITOLYN work when all those other bottles in my cabinet didn’t?

- **It fixes the problem, not just the symptoms.** Most supplements just give you a short boost, like caffeine or sugar. MITOLYN helps your cells make real energy, so you feel naturally awake all day.
- **It helps your body grow new “batteries.”** PQQ is a superstar ingredient that actually helps your body build more mitochondria. More mitochondria = more energy!
- **It protects your cells from getting old.** The antioxidants in MITOLYN fight off the “rust” that builds up in your cells as you age or get stressed.
- **It’s based on real science.** Every ingredient in MITOLYN has been studied in real research, and they work together to help your body and brain.

I’ve tried dozens of supplements over the years, but nothing has worked like MITOLYN because it goes right to the source of the problem.

# 🧬 Who Needs MITOLYN? (Spoiler: Probably You)

You might think only old people need something like MITOLYN, but honestly, I wish I’d started sooner. Here’s who can benefit:

- If you wake up tired, no matter how long you sleep
- If you need coffee just to “exist”
- If your brain feels foggy or you forget things easily
- If your workouts feel harder than they used to
- If you notice you’re aging faster, feeling stressed, or burned out

Even if you feel “okay” now, MITOLYN can take your energy and focus to a whole new level. It’s not just for people who are sick—it’s for anyone who wants to feel younger, stronger, and more alive.

# 🌟 My Final Verdict: MITOLYN is a No-Brainer

I don’t often call something “life-changing.” But MITOLYN truly is for me. It didn’t just help me feel less tired—it made me feel like myself again. I can keep up with my kids, get through my work, take care of my home, and still have energy left over to do the things I love.

If you’re tired of being tired, or you want to feel sharper, stronger, and younger, don’t wait. Give MITOLYN a try. It’s not magic, but it feels pretty close. I’m so grateful I found it, and I wish I could hand a bottle to everyone who’s struggling. Life is too short to feel exhausted all the time—take it back, starting today!

I’d give MITOLYN a 10 out of 10, and I recommend it to anyone who wants to feel better, inside and out. You deserve to feel this good too!",1,1745985187.0,LegendofMushroom,0,1.0,False

I was right where you are now, wondering if MITOLYN was just another bottle of empty promises. I hope my experience can help you decide if it’s worth a try.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

About a year ago, I hit a wall. Not a real wall, but it felt like one. I was always tired, even after sleeping in. It wasn’t the kind of tired you get after running around all day. It was a deep, heavy tired that stuck with me, no matter what. Every morning, I’d wake up wishing I could just stay in bed. I felt like I was moving through molasses—all slow, all blurry.

People kept saying, “You just need more sleep!” or “Maybe you’re stressed.” My doctor said my blood tests looked normal. But I knew something was off. Even little things like tying my shoes or answering a text felt huge. My mind was cloudy. My body felt like it was wearing a heavy backpack all the time.

It got to a point where I stopped looking forward to anything. I felt hopeless, like I’d never get my old self back. That was the scariest part.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN isn’t just another vitamin or energy drink. It’s a supplement made to help your mitochondria—the tiny engines inside your cells that give you energy. When you’re young, your mitochondria work great. But as you get older (or if you’re under a lot of stress), they can slow down. That means less energy, more tiredness, and even things like brain fog.

What makes MITOLYN different is that it doesn’t just give you a quick jolt or hide your symptoms. It’s designed to help your mitochondria work better, so your whole body feels more alive. Think of it like giving your car a tune-up instead of just putting more gas in the tank.

# Why I Took the Leap

Honestly, I was nervous about trying MITOLYN. I’ve tried energy boosters before—some made me jittery, some did nothing, and some made me crash hard. But the stories I read about MITOLYN were different. People talked about feeling steady energy, clear thinking, and even better moods.

I also did some reading on the ingredients—things like CoQ10, NAD+ boosters, and PQQ. These are backed by real science, not just marketing hype. So I figured, if MITOLYN really helps my body make more energy the natural way, maybe it’s worth a shot.

I ordered my first bottle, half-expecting nothing would happen. But I promised myself I’d stick with it for at least a month.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

I didn’t expect a miracle right away, and that’s not what happened. But by the third or fourth day, I noticed something small: I wasn’t dreading getting out of bed. My mornings were still slow, but I felt a tiny bit lighter. I didn’t need as much coffee to start my day, and my usual afternoon slump didn’t hit as hard.

It wasn’t a huge change, but it was enough to make me curious. For the first time in months, I had a little hope.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

By the second week, things really started to shift. It was like someone had cleaned my glasses. My brain felt sharper. I could finish a conversation without losing my train of thought, and chores didn’t seem so impossible.

I started getting back into hobbies I’d dropped, like sketching in the evenings or reading before bed. Even my family noticed I was more upbeat. My partner told me I was smiling more, and my friends said I seemed “lighter.” I started feeling like myself again.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

Week three was like flipping a switch. I woke up before my alarm, ready to start the day. I had energy to go for walks, run errands, and even try some new recipes in the kitchen. I didn’t feel like I was just scraping by—I felt strong and excited about life.

This wasn’t the fake, hyper energy you get from sugar or caffeine. It felt deep and steady, like my body remembered how to work properly.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

The surprise bonus? My sleep. I used to toss and turn for hours. But during week four, I was falling asleep fast and staying asleep all night. I’d wake up actually feeling rested.

I started noticing other small changes, too. My skin looked healthier, my mood swings weren’t as wild, and my stomach felt calmer after meals. It was like my whole body was getting a reset.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

MITOLYN gets its strength from a mix of science-backed ingredients. Here’s what’s inside (and why it matters):

- **PQQ (Pyrroloquinoline Quinone):** Helps your body grow new mitochondria and makes the old ones work better.
- **CoQ10:** Feeds your cells the energy they need to run smoothly.
- **NAD+ Precursors:** These help your cells repair themselves and may even slow down aging.
- **L-Carnitine & ALCAR:** Good for your brain and helps your body turn fat into energy.
- **B-Vitamins & Magnesium:** Important for your nerves, energy, and handling stress.

What I like is there are no fake flavors, no harsh chemicals, and no crazy stimulants. Just things your body already needs and uses.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

If you’re always tired, always dragging, or just feel like you’re living at half-speed, you should try MITOLYN. It’s also helpful if you:

- Can’t think straight or have a foggy brain
- Wake up tired no matter how much you sleep
- Feel older than you should, inside and out
- Miss the energy you had a few years ago

You don’t have to be sick to need help. Sometimes, your body just needs a gentle push to get back on track.

# Final Verdict: Don't Wait Like I Did

Looking back, I wish I hadn’t waited so long to try MITOLYN. I lost too much time just getting by and thinking “this is just how life is now.” I was wrong.

If you feel stuck, tired, or like your spark is gone, you don’t have to settle. MITOLYN helped me get my energy back, feel like myself, and actually enjoy life again. If you’re not sure, let this be your sign to give it a shot. Don’t wait for things to get worse or think you just have to deal with it.

### [✅ Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://4bdf3kthv1v33p4jsfs7cf3n5c.hop.clickbank.net)

# My Journey Before MITOLYN

Let me take you back to where I started. Before MITOLYN, I was stuck in a rut. I’m in my early forties, juggling work, kids, chores, and trying to squeeze in some “me time.” No matter what I did, I felt like my energy was stuck on empty. I could sleep for ten hours and still wake up tired. My thoughts felt foggy, and I’d forget little things all the time. By the afternoon, I’d be yawning nonstop, wishing for a nap I’d never get.

I tried everything I could think of: fancy vitamins, drinking more coffee, cutting out sugar, and even those trendy green smoothies. Nothing made a real difference. Honestly, it was frustrating and made me cranky. I wanted to feel good in my own body again. That’s when I heard about MITOLYN from an online group. People said it helped with energy and focus, so I figured, “Why not?” and took the leap.

# What Is MITOLYN, Really?

So, what is MITOLYN? In simple words, it’s a supplement made to help the “power plants” inside your cells—called mitochondria—work better. Think of your body like a big city, and every cell is a tiny house with its own generator. When those generators get weak, the lights in the city start to dim: you feel tired, slow, and just not yourself.

MITOLYN is packed with natural things like CoQ10, PQQ, and special herbs. These ingredients are like superfood snacks for your cells. They help recharge your body’s batteries and keep your “city” running brightly. What I liked most is that MITOLYN focuses on fixing the root problem instead of just covering up symptoms. It’s all about helping your cells make more energy, so your whole body feels better.

# My Results With MITOLYN (Week by Week)

Here’s what happened when I started taking MITOLYN every day for a whole year:

**Week 1:**  
I began with one pill each morning, just to see how my body would react. By the third day, I noticed I wasn’t dragging myself out of bed. I felt a little more awake, which was a nice surprise.

**Week 2:**  
The afternoon crash I always dreaded? It started to fade away. I could focus on work without getting distracted every five minutes. I even started feeling a bit lighter in my mood.

**Week 4:**  
By now, my sleep was a lot deeper. I woke up without feeling groggy, and I remembered my dreams again. My workouts felt easier, and I didn’t need to force myself to get moving. Friends began saying I looked more cheerful and energetic.

**Months 2-6:**  
The changes kept building! I lost almost 15 pounds without going on a strict diet. My skin looked healthier, and those “brain fog” moments happened way less. Even my family noticed that I laughed more and complained less about being tired.

**Month 12 (Now):**  
After a full year, I feel like a new person. I have steady energy all day long, not just a quick burst from coffee. I’m more focused at work and don’t forget things as much. My doctor said my blood tests looked great—my inflammation is down, and my body feels younger than before.

# Why MITOLYN Works (In Plain English)

The magic of MITOLYN is how it helps your cells make energy better. Here’s an easy way to picture it: If your body is a car, your cells are the engine. Over time, engines get rusty and slow. MITOLYN is like giving your engine a tune-up so it runs like new!

Here are some of the key things inside MITOLYN and what they do:

- **CoQ10:** Helps your cells turn food into energy, so you feel less tired and your heart stays strong.
- **PQQ:** Encourages your body to build new mitochondria, like adding more engines to your car.
- **NAD+ Boosters:** These help your cells repair themselves and slow down aging, so you feel sharper and younger.
- **Adaptogenic herbs (like Rhodiola and Ginseng):** These help your body handle stress and keep your mind clear, without any jitters or crashes.

All these ingredients work together to help your body stay balanced, energized, and healthy. MITOLYN doesn’t just cover up your tiredness; it fixes the reason you feel tired in the first place.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

I honestly think MITOLYN can help a lot of different people, especially if you:

- Feel tired or drained, even after a good night’s sleep
- Struggle to focus or remember things
- Notice extra weight or puffiness that won’t go away
- Wish you felt younger or more like yourself again
- Want to support your body’s health as you get older

I’ve told everyone in my family about it, and even my grumpy neighbor started taking it after seeing my results. If you want to feel more alive every day, MITOLYN is worth a try.

# Pros and Cons (Honest Opinion)

Here’s what I liked—and what I didn’t—about MITOLYN after a whole year:

**Pros:**
- I felt more energy in just a few days
- My focus and mood improved a lot
- No weird side effects (and I’m pretty sensitive!)
- Ingredients are natural and high quality
- The company is clear about what’s inside

**Cons:**
- It’s a bit more expensive than some vitamins, but the results were worth it for me
- You can only buy it online, which means waiting for shipping
- You need to remember to take it every day (I set a phone reminder)

# Final Verdict: Is MITOLYN Worth It?

After using MITOLYN for a year, I can honestly say it’s been a life-changer for me. My energy, focus, and mood are all better than they’ve been in years. I wake up ready for the day, stay sharp for work and family, and go to bed feeling proud of what I’ve done.

MITOLYN isn’t a magic pill, but it gave me back control over my health and happiness. If you’re tired of feeling tired and want to give your body the boost it deserves, I say give MITOLYN a shot.

# Before MITOLYN: A Life Half-Lived

A little while back, I felt like I was only living at half-power. I’m in my early 40s, but I felt so much older. Each morning, I’d wake up feeling like I barely slept. My joints were stiff. My brain felt slow, like I was stuck in mud. Even getting ready for the day felt like climbing a mountain.

I kept forgetting things—my keys, appointments, even people’s names sometimes. I started skipping get-togethers with friends. I used to love being active, but even short walks left me worn out. My mood went downhill, too. I felt grumpy and down most of the time, and I didn’t even want to try new things anymore.

The weird part? My doctor said everything looked “normal.” But inside, I knew something was really off. That’s when I stumbled on the idea of mitochondrial health, and that’s how I discovered MITOLYN.

# What Is MITOLYN and Why Is It So Powerful?

MITOLYN is not just a basic supplement you pick up at the store. It’s designed to help your mitochondria—the tiny “energy makers” inside every cell of your body. When your mitochondria are tired or damaged, you get all the symptoms I had: tiredness, brain fog, slow recovery, and just feeling blah.

But MITOLYN isn’t a quick energy shot or a sugary pick-me-up. It works deep down, helping your body’s cells make real, lasting energy again. That’s what makes it different.

Let me tell you what’s inside:

- **CoQ10 and PQQ:** These are like special fuel for your mitochondria, helping them work better and make more energy.
- **Acetyl-L-Carnitine:** This helps your body turn fat into energy and keeps your mind sharp.
- **Resveratrol & Alpha-Lipoic Acid:** These are powerful protectors for your cells. They help fight off things that make you feel old and sore.
- **NAD+ Precursors:** Scientists say these help your cells repair themselves and keep you feeling young.

But the real magic is how these ingredients work together. MITOLYN is made so everything helps everything else. That’s why it’s so powerful.

# Week 1: The Fog Begins to Lift

I started taking MITOLYN, and after a few days, things started to change. At first, I almost didn’t notice. I just felt a little less heavy when I got out of bed. My joints weren’t as stiff. I didn’t rush for coffee right away.

By the end of the week, I realized my mind felt less cloudy. It was like someone opened a window and let fresh air into my brain. I could follow conversations better. I remembered where I put things. I didn’t need to nap at lunchtime.

It wasn’t a huge, instant change. But I could feel things getting better. And that gave me hope.

# Week 2: Energy Like I Haven't Felt in Years

If the first week was about clearing the fog, the second week was all about real energy. Not the jittery, shaky energy you get from too much caffeine—this was calm, steady, and strong.

I got through my days without yawning every hour. I went for a walk after work and didn’t feel wiped out. I even started doing light exercises again, and instead of feeling drained, I felt refreshed.

At work, I could focus for hours. I didn’t get distracted or frustrated as easily. My coworkers asked if I was “on something” because I seemed so alert and happy. Honestly, I just felt like myself again—for the first time in years.

# Week 3: A New Me Emerges

By week three, I noticed changes I didn’t even expect. I was sleeping better—falling asleep faster and waking up before my alarm, feeling rested. I wasn’t snapping at little things or feeling down for no reason. My mood just felt brighter.

People started telling me I looked healthier. My skin was clearer. My eyes were brighter. Even my hair seemed shinier. The aches in my joints faded away. I stopped reaching for pain relievers.

It was like I pressed a “reset” button for my body and mind. I started doing more, laughing more, living more. MITOLYN didn’t just give me energy—it helped me feel like “me” again.

# The Real Secret? Cellular Healing.

Here’s what I learned: Most people try to fix their problems from the outside—more sleep, more coffee, more medicine. But the real answer is inside your cells. When your mitochondria slow down, everything else does, too.

MITOLYN helps your cells heal and make energy the way they did when you were younger. It’s not a band-aid—it’s real, deep healing. That’s why it works when nothing else does.

Once I understood this, it made total sense why nothing else helped me before. MITOLYN gets right to the root of the problem.

# Is MITOLYN Worth It? 1000x YES.

I was worried at first. I’ve tried so many things that didn’t work. But MITOLYN isn’t just hype. It’s based on real science, and you can feel it working if you give it a fair chance.

It’s not just about having more energy. It’s about getting your life back—enjoying your family, working with passion, moving without pain, thinking clearly, and smiling for no reason at all.

MITOLYN did all that for me. If you’re feeling even a little bit like I did before—just try it. You might be surprised by how different life can feel.

# Final Verdict: MITOLYN is a Must-Have for Anyone Over 30

If you care about staying healthy, feeling young, and having energy to live your life, MITOLYN is something you should try. It’s not a quick fix—it’s a real change you feel deep down.

Start with one bottle like I did. You might notice a difference in just a few days. I did—and I haven’t looked back.

# The Slow Burn of Fatigue and Hopelessness

A while ago, every day felt like I was dragging a giant backpack full of rocks. I wasn’t sick, but I wasn’t really living either. I woke up tired and went to bed exhausted. It felt like my energy tank had a leak I couldn’t fix. Even when I rested, I never recharged.

My doctor ran all the usual tests. They said I was healthy, but I knew I wasn’t. My mind was always foggy. My body just felt “blah.” Every small task—like brushing my teeth or answering a simple text—felt like climbing a mountain. It was scary to feel so far from my old self.

I missed laughing easily. I missed bouncing out of bed. I missed feeling “awake” in my own life. I needed something to help, and that’s when I came across MITOLYN.

# What Is MITOLYN?

MITOLYN is a supplement, but it’s not like the ones you see at the grocery store. It’s designed to help the mitochondria in your cells. If you don’t remember, mitochondria are like tiny energy factories inside your body. They make the power that keeps everything running smoothly.

As we get older, our mitochondria can get tired and don’t work as well. When that happens, you start to feel tired, foggy, and even older than you are. MITOLYN’s goal is to wake those mitochondria up and get them humming again.

I liked that MITOLYN wasn’t just a “quick boost” like coffee or energy drinks. It’s meant to help your body work better from the inside out.

# Why I Took the Leap

I was honestly doubtful at first. I’ve tried all sorts of things before—green juices, energy pills, fancy teas. Most of them didn’t do much. Some even made me feel worse!

But I read reviews about MITOLYN from people who sounded a lot like me. They said it gave them steady energy, a clearer mind, and better sleep—not just a sugar rush and a crash. They talked about feeling like themselves again.

I also liked that MITOLYN’s ingredients had real science behind them. It wasn’t a bunch of weird stuff. I saw familiar words like CoQ10 and B vitamins, plus things I’d heard about in health podcasts. So, I figured, why not try it for a month? I had nothing to lose except my constant tiredness.

# Week 1: Subtle But Promising

The first week, I didn’t expect much. But after a few days, I noticed I wasn’t hitting snooze five times every morning. I actually got out of bed without feeling like a zombie.

By Friday, my afternoons weren’t as rough. Usually, I’d get so tired after lunch that I’d stare at the wall and daydream about naps. Now, I could focus enough to finish my work. I even skipped my second cup of coffee and didn’t regret it.

It wasn’t a miracle, but it was the first hint that something good might be happening.

# Week 2: Clarity, Focus, Drive

This is where things started getting exciting. I woke up before my alarm a couple of times. My brain felt sharper, like someone cleaned the windows in my head.

I didn’t have to force myself to get things done. I just did them. I finished chores I’d been putting off for weeks. I even had energy left over to read a book before bed.

My family noticed, too. My sister said I seemed happier. My partner told me I was laughing more. It was like coming out of a long, grey tunnel.

# Week 3: Energy Like I Had in My 20s

By the third week, I felt like I’d discovered a secret. I hadn’t felt this strong in years. I went for walks and didn’t get winded. I cooked dinner from scratch, danced in the kitchen, and still had energy to play with my dog.

It wasn’t jittery or fake energy. It felt deep and real, like my body finally remembered how to work properly. I started making plans to do more things I loved, like drawing and biking.

# Week 4: Deep Sleep and Radiant Health

One of the best surprises was my sleep. Before, I’d toss and turn, or wake up in the middle of the night. Now, I fall asleep quickly and wake up feeling ready for the day.

My skin started looking brighter. My stomach felt calmer. I didn’t snap at people as much, because I wasn’t running on empty all the time.

I realized it was all connected—my energy, my mood, even my digestion. MITOLYN was helping my whole body work better, not just giving me a little more pep.

# The Ingredients That Make It Work

I did some research on what’s inside MITOLYN. Here are some of the powerful things it uses:

- **PQQ**: Helps your body make new mitochondria and keeps them strong.
- **CoQ10**: Gives your cells the fuel they need to make energy.
- **NAD+ Precursors**: These are like secret helpers for your body’s repair and anti-aging systems.
- **L-Carnitine & ALCAR**: They help your brain work better and turn fat into fuel.
- **B-Vitamins & Magnesium**: Keep your nerves healthy, support energy, and help with stress.

There’s nothing weird or fake in MITOLYN. No caffeine, no sugar, no crazy chemicals. Just good stuff your body recognizes and needs.

# Who Should Try MITOLYN?

You might want to give MITOLYN a shot if:

- You’re tired all the time, but doctors say you’re “fine.”
- You feel foggy, forgetful, or unmotivated.
- You sleep but never wake up refreshed.
- Your energy isn’t what it used to be, and you want it back.

If you’re ready to feel more alive, MITOLYN might be the answer. I wish someone had told me about it sooner.

# Final Verdict: Don't Wait Like I Did

If I could go back in time, I’d tell myself not to wait so long to try MITOLYN. I wasted too many days feeling half-awake and thinking it was just part of getting older or being stressed.

You don’t have to live on “low battery.” You don’t have to accept feeling tired and blah. MITOLYN helped me get my spark back, and I believe it can help you too.

So if you’re on the fence, consider this your friendly nudge. Don’t wait until you’re at your lowest. Try MITOLYN now. You might be surprised by how good you can feel again—inside and out.",1,1745985133.0,LegendofMushroom,0,1.0,False

1kb7bez,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kb7bez/aith_for_blocking_an_childhood_friend/,AITH for blocking an childhood friend,"Before we get into this story, I understand that I was a small prick for somethings in this story. But I really need advice. 

This started 2 years ago and has taken a worse turn. I female (25) moved away from my childhood friend, trans (24). We took highschool together till I moved away and then we called and drifted apart. We would talk and call, but it started to ruin my mental health. My friend let's call RJ, started taking every happy moment I had with my then boyfriend and turning it into his moment. RJ talked about everything he could that would make me feel guilty. Some examples: I went on a coffee date and he would say that it was nice then tell me that he got broken up with and need advice because he likes someone new. Etc. 
The thing is, I don't mind giving advice but when I also stuggled like my break up he said it was nothing compared to what he was going through. This happened for many years, until I grew a backbone and did a test. I stopped being the first one to text or ask how him life was going and waited... well after one year he texted me at 2 in the morning to ask me for advice because he broke up with his then boyfriend. I then realized that I was nothing but a therapist, after one year there was no ""hello"" or ""miss you, let's catch up"". I was mad at first, this was the person who helped with my mental health in highschool, but I could always remember times where he was rude and treated me like I was a person to follow him. Times where he would be single and try and break up my relationship because he didn't wanna be single alone, I would have to hangout with him after school and text my parents to make excuses to get me out of hanging out. 

So after the test I decided I wasn't gonna yell or explain how I felt anymore. (I had told him in the past and brought up how I just wanted one happy moment instead of his negative thoughts) so I blocked him on everything, messages, calls, socials, family contacts. I erased him. And I never thought of it till 8 months later when he started texting my now boyfriend at the middle of the night for advice. Which my boyfriend told me about and blocked him too. 

---------------
This bring us to now, months later. I got a call from an old highschool friend (let's call Nicky) that knew RJ and called me after 5 years of not talking to tell me that RJ wanted to talk and noticed he was blocked. I was angry, it took him 8 more months to find out I was done with him, and now he was bringing in others to try and force me back. I was terrified, after years I build up confidence and my own happiness, without RJ's negativity. I found new love, I did great in school and work on my mental health and body. Until now I had to call this old friend and tell them half of everything, finding out they took records and texted RJ everything and then RJ flipped the story and is begging for me to be back. But I truly don't know if I can do it again, I stopped for a real reason and now he wants back in. Telling me he has changed but I know he hasn't because he turned the story when he heard what I said. Now I'm left wondering what should I do, trust again and try to escape. 

I've lived my life for years without the fake movie best friends, just me and my family and boyfriend. I'm better without drama and without being a teacher/therapist. I don't wanna let him back in, but I feel the guilt again creeping up, ready for me to fold. And now I don't know if I wanna block Nicky for only reaching out just to help RJ with his toxicity.

For some background on myself,  
I weighed 187 lbs, standing 5'11 mid January, presently i'm 150 lbs, 47 days without junk food, previously 88 and I've learned alot about how to diet and how to stick to it.

First, Dieting is about balance. If I’m on an 1800-calorie plan, you’d think it’s miserable, and don’t get me wrong, it *is*. But I make it much more bearable by planning in 1–2 things I genuinely enjoy every day.  
For example: I love peanut butter. So instead of cutting it out, I budget 270 calories for it and make it fit. Same with coffee, I’ll track the creamer and syrup because it makes my day that much more enjoyable.

Second, I'm on a bodybuilding prep right now, and i think some of those principles can be applied to dieting. Many bodybuilders employ refeed days, and i think that can be translated to dieting. Refeed days are HIGH carb and higher calorie days (For me its about 500g carbs, 200g Protein, 2800 cals compared to my usual 1800 ) to replenish glycogen stores, low glycogen stores often cause cravings. These refeed days implemented every 2-3 weeks when cravings become mad absolutely remove any urge to cheat on my diet. Plus it gives your body the opportunity to really enjoy more food again, It shouldn’t feel like a cheat day, just a controlled mental and physical reset.

Cheat days are important and I think should be implemented as often as it feels just out of reach, like say every 3 weeks, reducing  guilt of a cheat day because you had to work hard and push yourself to get there

Third,  I want to address binge eating, The cleaner and higher-protein your base diet is, the less likely you are to binge. Hydration + fiber + protein = satiety. If you’ve ever eaten junk all day and still felt hungry, you know how important this is. Build your meals to keep you full.

Fourth:  
Love cookies? Look  high-protein recipes like Greek yogurt-based protein cookie doughs or even  a cookie flavored protein powder (I love Ghost chips ahoy). For nearly every sweet out there, there’s a higher-protein version online, That tastes decent enough to kill the craving!

Fifth: Food Temptation  
Any food that you know will set you back in your diet should be viewed as just that a roadblock to your progress, It gets easier to say no when I see that cookie as a direct obstacle to my goals.

Na-late din ako kasi hindi okay pakiramdam ko. Late na ako sa call time, tapos biglang nag-chat si crush “Balita ko masama raw pakiramdam mo” (ang daldal talaga ng boss namin hahaha). Sabi ko, “Yes, pero uminom naman na ako ng gamot,” at sinabi ko na rin sa kanya na papunta na ako.

Yes, pumasok pa rin ako kahit hindi ako okay. Pagdating ko, diretso na agad sa work. and may guest kami from another country, ang ganda niya at naging crushie ko siya. Nagbatian kami. Wala masyadong interaction with my crush that day kasi sobrang busy talaga kami sa work.

(CRUSHIE - girl from the other country and CRUSH - my co-worker)

Kailangan na naming pumunta sa kabilang building, so sumakay kami sa service. Usually, magkatabi kami ni crush, pero this time ginawa ng co-worker namin ng paraan na mahiwalay kami—gumitna sila. Huhu, kainis. Pero wala, kailangan din naming pigilan minsan ang pagiging clingy kasi mukha talagang may something (kahit wala naman talaga).

Tinitingnan ko siya minsan, pero nakatingin lang siya sa window, nagmumuni-muni. Ganon na rin ginawa ko—muni-muni rin sa kabilang window. YES, magkabilang dulo pa kami ng van, kaya sobrang layo talaga namin sa isa’t isa hahaha.

Pagdating namin sa venue, hindi na kami nakatiis—nag-holding hands na kami ulit at naging clingy na naman. Hindi na kami naghiwalay hahaha. Pero lowkey lang. Minsan talaga kinokontrol ko pa. After namin matapos ang work, bumalik kami sa office at as usual, magkalayo na naman kami ng upuan.

Actually, hirap maging clingy sa kanya that day kasi for some reason, parang ginagawa talaga ng co-workers namin ng paraan na hindi kami magdikit hahahaha. Nagmeeting kami, tapos nag-harutan kami kahit papano. Inaasar ko siya about dun sa guy na kausap niya hahaha. Tapos pinatong niya pa paa niya sa legs ko! Hay nako, tinitingnan na naman kami. Hindi talaga namin kaya ’yung hindi magdikit haha.

Umuwi na rin kami agad kasi maaga pa ang call time namin for the last day of our project. While nagbo-book ako, sabi ko baka hindi na ako matulog kasi may tatapusin pa akong school works. Baka pag natulog ako, hindi na ako magising sa oras. Nagalit siya, sabi niya kailangan ko raw matulog. Pero nag-insist ako na tatapusin ko naman agad, at baka may time pa ako for a power nap. Tapos sabi niya, “Samahan kita, hindi rin ako matutulog.” (Akala mo naman magkasama kami sa bahay hahaha.)

Ayun, 2AM, nagchat siya. Niche-check niya kung gising pa ako. Sakto, gising na ako nun galing sa power nap. Nag-send ako ng sticker na bagong gising, tapos tinanong niya, “Nakatulog ka?” Sabi ko, “Yes.” After nun, nag-ready na kami kasi sabi niya gusto muna niya mag-coffee somewhere. Sinundo niya ako sa bahay, at bumaba pa talaga siya ng sasakyan para batiin parents ko. Tapos umalis na rin kami.

Napansin ko sa mukha niya—mukhang inaantok pa siya, parang walang tulog. Sabi ko, “Kulang ka ba sa tulog?” Sabi niya, “Hindi ako natulog kasi sabi mo hindi ka matutulog.” Huhu, kainis—tinotoo niya talaga.

Pagdating namin sa work, pinasakay kami sa van para pumunta sa venue. Kinulang ng isang upuan kaya siningit niya sarili niya sa tabi ko. Nakita ko nahihirapan siya, so nag-offer ako, “dito ka na lang umupo sa lap ko.” Ang bilis niya tumayo at umupo agad hahaha. Niyakap ko na siya agad (halatang gustong gusto niya yung pwesto niya haha). Pinagtinginan na naman kami lol.

As usual, busy ulit kami. Konti lang talaga interaction namin kasi lagi siyang hinihila ng co-workers. Di ko alam bakit, pero parang nagkakahiyaan kami lapitan isa’t isa that day hahaha. Then nagka-chance kami, may pinakita siya sa akin sa phone na selfie niya with co-worker namin. Tapos tanong niya, “Sino mas maganda?” Syempre inasar ko siya, hindi ko siya tinuro hahaha. Ang cute ng reaction niya!

Nahihiya ako mag-compliment sa kanya that day. Gusto ko kasi kami lang dalawa, hahaha.

Fast forward, patapos na project namin, naghihintay na lang kami ng uwian. Biglang nagyaya si boss ng last day dinner kasama ang mga guest from another country. While waiting sa service, magkatabi kami, nagkukwentuhan with our co-workers. Tapos pagpasok sa van, magkatabi na kami ulit hahaha.

Medyo mahaba ang biyahe kaya naglean siya sa akin at natulog sa balikat ko. Yung kamay ko, pinatong ko sa kamay niya. Paminsan-minsan humihiga rin ako sa kanya pero di naman talaga ako inaantok—gusto ko lang siya ma-feel hahaha. Alam kong gising pa siya kasi pag malalim ang tulog niya may soft snore siya hahaha. So alam kong nararamdaman niya na nilalaro ko kamay niya—medyo ginagalaw ko kasi gusto kong ipa-feel na gusto ko siya kahit sa actions lang.

Buti na lang hindi niya inaalis kamay niya, naka-stay lang. Gusto ko na sana mag-holding hands pero pinipigilan namin sarili namin. Buong ride, ganon lang kami.

Pagdating sa restaurant, magkatabi ulit kami kumain—pero nasa harap ko si crushie from another country. Nahiya ako bigla hahaha. Habang kumakain kami, may isang co-worker na biglang nagsabi sa akin, “Ang pogi mo naman dahil sa getup mo,” tapos pinipicturan pa ako! Nasa harap lang niya si crush ko nun, tapos bigla siyang humarap kay crush sabay sabi, “Ang pogi niya, no?”—referring to me.

Pero hindi sumagot si crush ko. Hindi ko rin nakita reaction niya—sayang! Hahaha. Ako naman, nahihiya lang, kaya nginitian ko na lang ’yung co-worker namin habang tuloy pa rin kami sa pagkain. Biglang nagyaya si crushie mag-TikTok kami lahat. Pumayag naman kami.

After non, magpapaalam na si crushie. Hays. Ang daming co-worker namin na nag-fangirl at hiningian siya ng IG. Ako rin gusto ko, pero nahihiya ako. Nagpapicture pa sila, samantalang ako nasa gilid lang, nanonood. Katabi ko si crush, nanonood lang din. Mukhang hindi siya interested.

Habang nagkakagulo, bumulong ako kay crush, “Gusto ko yung vibes niya. Gusto ko rin makuha IG niya.” Sabi niya, “Oh, punta ka na don,” with  teasing smile. Sabi ko, “Nahihiya ako.” Hahaha.

Pa-alis na talaga si crushie, nagba-bye na siya, naghug na siya ng mga tao. Ako, gusto ko rin lumapit pero nahiya ako. Tapos sabi nung katabi ko (si crush), “Magpaalam ka na sa crushie mo,” bulong niya sa akin. Sabi ko, “Huh?” Hahaha, patay-malisya pa ako baka akalain niya bading ako HAHAHA.

Sakto, papunta sa amin si crushie! Kinabahan ako pero gusto ko rin magpaalam. Tumalon-talon siya papunta sa amin (cute). Ni-hug niya yung katabi ko (manager namin), tapos nag-eye contact kami. Tinaas ko kamay ko, nanghihingi ng hug HAHAHAHAHA nakakahiya pero ayun, ni-hug niya ako! Nag-thank you pa siya. After namin mag-hug, nag-holding hands kami while smiling at nag small chika.

Ang cute niya, at ang bait talaga!

Tapos nung lumingon ako, nakita ko si crush nanonood pala sa interaction namin hahaha. Mukhang okay lang naman siya, nakangiti siya hmm…

After nun, pauwi na kami. Sabay ulit kami umuwi ng bahay, pero may isa kaming co-worker na sumabay din. Magkakalayo kami ng pwesto—isang tao sa harap, tapos kami ni crush sa likod pero may pagitan. So hindi kami pwede mag-cling.

Pero 15 mins away na lang sa bahay niya, bigla niya akong hinila, “Halika nga ditooo.” Napahiga ako sa lap niya, nag-cling siya sa akin sabay sabi, “Ayaw ko pa umuwi,” habang yakap ako.

Gusto ko man yayain siya sa bahay, kaso marami siyang gamit, pagod na rin siya, at may kasama pa kami sa car hahaha. Nanahimik lang siya pero feel ko nakikinig siya sa amin.

Pagdating sa bahay nila, hindi siya agad bumaba. Pinisil niya pa mukha ko hahaha pinanggigilan niya muna ako, nagpaalam, then finally bumaba. Nakatingin lang siya sa sasakyan habang paalis kami.

Hays. Gusto ko talaga sabihin na iwan na lang niya gamit niya at sa bahay ko na siya matulog. Pero nagpigil ako kasi may kasama pa ako.

Sobrang bitin talaga yung araw na yun.

Naalala ko, niyaya ko pala siya sumama sa hometown ko. Na-excite siya—gusto niya raw, at magpapaalam siya sa mom niya. Waiting pa ako kung papayagan siya. Sana payagan siya! Excited na akong ipakita sa kanya ang hometown ko at ipakilala siya sa family ko hahaha.",1,1745984357.0,WLW_PH,2,1.0,False

A few years back I received a message on LinkedIn from a final year Marketing student from the University of Sydney. She had applied for an Internship at the company I was working at, and was asking if I could offer any assistance or advice with the process and getting the role. I get many messages like this and sometimes I reply if I have time, but mostly I ignore it. On this occasion I ignored the message. A few days later I get another message from her saying that if I helped her she would ówe'me.

Well, being a male, I replied and said I could potentially help her. She suggested catching up for a coffee in the city. 

So a few days later we caught up and she made it clear at the meeting that if I helped her get one of the Internships that she would make it very much worth my while. 

So I did - I gave her insights into the testing and also provided her the interview questions in advance. I was also on the panel and gave her top marks. She got the job!

She started a few months later and to be honest I wasnt really expecting anything to happen. But in her first week, she messaged me on Teams and told me to meet her in the disabled toilet in 5 mins and to lightly knock 3 times. I did, she opened the door with her finger over her mouth in a shooshing motion. She had already put a towel down. She was wearing a skirt, sat down, spread her legs and she was not wearing any underwear. We didnt have sex but I did go down on her - It was amazing!

That is where it ended with her, and we never spoke again for approx 6 months. When she messaged me again and said she had a friend in the year below her at Uni who had also applied for an Internship, she asked if I could help her too.

Well I did of course, she too got an Internship. This time after she commenced she took me into a closed meeting room with no windows and locked the door. She bent over in front of me, lifted her skirt and pulled down her panties. This time I fingered her and ate her out from behind.

That was the last time we ever spoke. Both have progressed their careers in the company and are doing really well. I have not needed to have anything to do with either of them since and we have never spoken.

Would I do it again - most likely. Should I, No.",3,1745984288.0,confession,1,1.0,False

M,  
I don’t know how I got so lucky to find you. When you came into my life, everything was changing. I was starting over, uncertain of what the future held, and, honestly, feeling a little lost.  
But then, there you were—just when I needed you most. A fluke, maybe… or more likely, fate stepping in to say, *“This one’s for you.”*

I still remember our first date. I was so nervous I could barely sit still, but the moment I saw your smile and looked into those unforgettable blue eyes, something shifted. We had just met, but somehow, I felt at home.

You have this incredible ability to make me laugh when I want to cry, crack jokes in the middle of chaos, and remind me not to take life too seriously—unless, of course, we’re on one of our foodie tours, where finding the perfect bite is serious business.

I once stumbled upon a quote that says, *“I regretted many decisions until I realized they led me to you.”* Every choice I made, even the imperfect ones, led me to you. And I would do them all over again if it meant finding you.

You believe in me, even when I don’t. You push me to be my best and love me without condition. With you, I feel seen, safe, and completely myself.

Whether we’re nerding out over video games, blasting emo songs on road trips and singing at the top of our lungs, hiking with the dogs, or sharing coffee on a quiet morning—every moment with you feels like home. Even when Charlie is barking at absolutely nothing.

And now, as we stand here together in Northern Ireland, I’m reminded that every twist of fate, every moment that brought us here, was part of the journey that led me to you. This, too, is another one of our adventures.

So today, I make you these promises:  
I promise to always be ready for spontaneous journeys, and to turn even ordinary moments into extraordinary ones.  
I promise to laugh with you, cry with you, and always dance awkwardly with you in the kitchen.  
I promise to be your player two, your backup vocalist, your dog co-parent, and your forever coffee date.  
I promise to let you win every once in a while when we’re playing board games, but don’t get too used to it.  
I promise to always have your back—no matter what life throws our way, I’ll stand by you and face it together.  
And most of all, I promise to choose you—every day, through every high and low, with all my heart.

I know marriage won’t always be smooth sailing, but with you by my side, I’m ready for whatever comes our way. You’re my best friend, my light in the darkness. I love you—both the person you are today and the one you’ll become as we navigate this journey together. I’m so excited to explore the rest of our lives, discovering new things together and growing old with you.",3,1745984146.0,Eloping,3,1.0,False

I have a chemical imbalance that makes me rather depressed everyday and for over the last year(or two?), I've been neglectful towards my personal health and hygiene. I've gotten better but taking a shower is and grooming my fascial hair is one thing, starting to brush my teeth everyday after not doing so for several months is another.

I was under the impression that I had allowed my teeth to suffer some serious irreversible damage, at the very least allowed bacteria from foods and plaque buildup to erode away at my enamel. I was expecting to be told by both the person who did my dental cleaning along with the Dentist who then inspected my teeth and x-rays, to tell me that I had gingivitis(possibly early signs of it) and few to several cavities.

I asked them both questions of course. How to take better care moving forward and asking how bad they truly were. Gums and all. They said it was obvious that I wasn't flossing as I had a bit of tartar by the base of a few of my teeth, specifically the bottom front ones. Other than that no cavities nor other real concerns. The Dentist said I should get my wisdom teeth removed as one is growing in sideways into another molar, so that's been scheduled. And that's it, gums look normal I believe? Don't look inflamed or red and they made no mention of them other then again, needing to floss as I had a bit of tartar.

I brushed thoroughly leading up to this deep cleaning of course, but literally just this morning hours before my appointment. I have drank a lot of coffee and energy drinks within the last year plus and again, I'd go several months without brushing them(terrible I know). My teeth don't look orange or yellow, just a very pale white. Though I've noticed I have patches of very white parts on the tips/tops of all or most of my teeth. Most noticeable on the molars, think in the past they(at the same place) had mentioned that this was caused by calcium from my diet.

In my family, my dad hasn't had a cavity in all of his adulthood but has in his youth. My mother, a very hygienic person, same as my older half brother(her son), both get cavities very easily and their teeth look whiter than mine. Their teeth, unlike my dad and mine, are rather small looking. I'm sure genetics is playing a role here but can that really be all there was to it? I have never had a cavity before, and I'm now in my late twenties. Did I just get lucky or is there something I may be eating that is helping out here? I don't drink soda or eat candy, nor drink alcohol. My only sugar intact comes from fruits, energy drinks, and coffee creamer I suppose. For food, my dad usually cooks meals and I rarely eat out, maybe a total of 10 times(definitely less) within the last 1 to 2 years. I eat lots of protein, whether it be a few eggs a week, cheeses, nuts, red meats, and seafood. Other than that it's fruits, vegetables, and grains. Very limited on store goods that don't require prep, like no yogurts or prepackaged dry snacks. Lots of water too.

Sorry if my post is redundant or not at all that important, I'm just curious. I was under the impression that cavities were fairly common to get from time to time, no matter how clean and white said teeth appeared to be.",1,1745984032.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False
1kb70u4,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_StayOrGo2024/comments/1kb70u4/things_were_better_until_they_werent/,Things Were Better... Until They Weren't,"It's been almost a year since I learned that what I'd been dealing with for the last 8 years or so wasn't normal and no, I'm not crazy, I've just been told I am. 

I wish I could remember what triggered this realization, what finally got me to search reddit (Google, who?) to see if anyone else had experienced what I had. I can't remember the triggering fight, but I can still remember how utterly unhinged I felt, curled in a ball in my home office after yet *another* verbal altercation, wondering ""why does this keep happening, what am I doing wrong? Why can't I get better?"" How was it *always* my fault that he would blow up like this? I never got this angry at him, so obviously he isn't doing anything wrong. But what was so wrong with me that I couldn't stop messing up time after time after time. A small mistake, misstep, or misspoken word would set him off -- but it was because it was the same mistake I had made a thousand times before; I should know better by now. If I really cared about him, I would change myself enough to stop annoying him. But clearly I didn't give a shit about him, I was selfish and a bad wife, I lacked empathy or compassion. He knew this whole thing was a mistake, he should have left so long ago.

This time the verbal lashes were bad enough that I looked up how many ibuprofen I would need on hand to just... go to sleep. I didn't want to be here anymore. I didn't want to hurt like this anymore, and frankly I just believed that there was no point and I didn't matter. 

But instead I went to reddit and found countless posts and comments and stories of people who experienced the exact same thing as me. And suddenly, after reading probably a hundred posts spanning 10+ years, I knew what I had been dealing with. What I was dealing with, and frankly, still am even a year later. The short temper, the yelling, the insults, the blaming. It always started over what felt like *nothing* and always happened right when I got comfortable again after the last blow-up. I remember, even years ago, constantly thinking to myself ""wow, things have been good lately. we haven't had a fight in like three weeks. this is great, I must be getting 'better'!"" only for another emotional explosion to take place that same damn day. Like he could fucking read my mind and that was his cue to put me back in line. 

Reading others' experiences gave me confidence in myself again. I am NOT crazy, I am NOT a screw-up who can't do anything right, I am NOT a shitty person. I AM an emotionally abused woman. That was a scary realization but it also felt strangely good to have a ""diagnosis"", some closure in a way. I know what's ""wrong"" with me now, and I can start treating it and healing. And I have, in some small ways. 

A few months after my ""research"" and realizations, we ended up moving out of state for a job opportunity. I was leaving the only friends and family I had. I knew he wasn't happy where we were. But at the same time, I had a theory that he just wasn't happy anywhere at all. This has proven to be mostly true, as far as I can tell. Anyway, he moved first to start the job. It was in-person and he had a nice relocation package and all that. Of course, as his personal assistant (who works full-time in a mentally taxing career and also does about 90% of the household work), I was lucky enough to coordinate everything related to our move. The household pack up, movers, having both cars picked up at different dates, listing the house for rent, changing insurance, arranging pet transportation, dealing with reimbursements, the whole 9,000 yards. 

But, honestly? Not having him there, in person, breathing down my neck and complaining about every email he only half-read and never responded to, was such a relief. It made everything 10x easier. And I got to spend time with my friends and family without him throwing looks at me every ten minutes indicating that he wants to leave. And I could talk freely without the fear of him drilling down into every word I spoke and ""why would I say it like that instead of like this"" or ""what did so-and-so mean when they said this? don't they know that 's so rude to ask? Did they try to start a fight?"" God I forgot how it felt to enjoy myself around others without judgement of every little thing I said or did (""why do you always make that face I hate when I say x?""). Also, I was allowed to have more than one drink at dinner and it was AWESOME.

Fast-forward to me joining him and it was... smooth. Things were looking good, really good. We moved into our new place (which I found, coordinated tours, and paid the deposits on, by the way) and settled into our new routine. He commuted to an office every day and I continued in my WFH job. And my god was it blissful. No one interrupting during the day. No one giving unsolicited advice on how I should present myself and my tone in my Zoom meetings. NO COOKING A GROWN MAN BREAKFAST AND LUNCH EVERYDAY AND ALSO GETTING HIM MULTIPLE COFFEES ON DEMAND. I had so much more free time, I got a meal service so I didn't need to think about grocery shopping or meal planning. All I do is cook once a day and I have lunch and dinner ready. 

And our relationship felt immensely better. We had a great gym routine going. Fuck, even my libido recovered (also might have to do with the new brand of BC I started around that time). And we didn't have a blow-out fight for MONTHS, which was pretty much unheard of. 

But then his office started charging to park and he took it as a personal slight. Clearly, they were targeting him, weren't they? Just another way for his job to show how much they don't appreciate him even though he's the best at his job and probably one of the best in his industry. So of course he took a stand and decided to starting working from home. Then it was back to waking him up like he's a 10 year old late for the school bus, making his coffee and breakfast, making lunch, and then make dinner while he plays video games that he ""can't pause, just start eating without me"". Helping write his work emails (I mean, really?) and being his emotional toilet after a meeting or a slack message where a co-worker invariably pissed him off. 

And then the shopping trip happened. First it all began when we played musical cars to take out the weekend driver from our tandem garage. I backed up but didn't go back far enough, so he had to do a three point turn to maneuver out of the drive way fully. He had words for that one, but I thought it was just the ordinary critiquing of me doing just about anything in a way he wouldn't do it. Then we got to the store. I wanted to shop a bit, I had a good coupon and wanted some new spring clothes. He found some good stuff, too. I went into the fitting rooms to try everything on. About halfway through he texts me that he's in the line (usually the line is quite long, so he'll hop in early), but ""no rush."" I wrap up, having a few items that I liked, but needed to swap for a different size before checking out. I walk out and see him at the front of the line, he's letting some people go past him since he's waiting for me. At this point the line isn't long. I say I'm going to swap a couple of things, be right back. Apparently he texted me while I was doing my swap, asking what's going on, what's taking so long. I didn't see the texts; it took me probably 3 minutes total to go to the clothing spots, swap out, and get back to the line. 

When I get back to the line, he's pissed. ""What's going on?"" he snaps. I said I was putting the clothes I tried on away and getting the correct size. He asks why I ignored his texts. I pulled out my phone and finally read them, said I didn't know he texted me. He then berates me about putting my clothes away. ""You just put them on the rack near the fitting room and the employee puts them away, you don't need to do their job for them."" I explain that I was going to the same spot anyway to get the correct size, so I just put them back. It didn't cost any extra time. He didn't appreciate this ""excuse"". Then an older woman behind us in line joined in, saying that I did a nice thing by putting the clothes back for the employee, that it was a kind gesture. He sort of shrugs her off, smiling somewhat. I just fucking *knew* that once she said something that I was going to get it afterwards. He tosses his stuff on the counter, we check out, he ignores the big bag the cashier hands us and he walks toward the door with me behind. 

As we walk to the car he hits me with the ""I'm taking you home, we wasted a perfectly good day inside the store instead of spending it outside in the sun."" Mind you, we were shopping for about 40 minutes, it wasn't even 1:00pm yet, and we had planned to walk around a local park after shopping. I of course ask what's wrong, what happened? Then he unloads on me. How dare I make him wait in the line. He was so embarrassed having to let other shoppers cut ahead of him while he waited for me to do the employee's job while I *knew* he was waiting for me. I always do this shit, then he leans into me about the car earlier. I can't even drive the car normally, I ruined the whole day. Then when I try to assert myself in the car he begins accelerating, jerking around the parking lot, driving recklessly. We screamed in the car, I told him I'm sick of feeling like I'm crazy, that he lets anything ruin his day, he can't ever let anything just go. Any small inconvenience throws him off. He said I was being unsupportive, that I should have told the lady in line to mind her own business, that she doesn't know what the fuck she's talking about when she's commenting on our situation.

I end up crying, he says that I just do that to make him feel bad. He drops me off outside of our complex (doesn't even go inside the driveway, just parks along the side of the street out front) and won't open the trunk to let me get the shopping bag and my coat with the house keys. Finally I have to walk back to the door and ask him to open the trunk. He actually does feel bad and tells me gently to get back in the car, we can still go to the park. We do, we get lunch, we go home. Only later does he finally (and lamely) ask if I was sad about earlier in the day. I said yes, and he sort of apologized, but it never came up again.

And just like that... libido gone, I begin to pull away again. I keep my distance until I don't need to walk on eggshells anymore. Then... 

About two weeks later he unloads on me again. This time his trigger was my fingernails. Yes, I have a bad habit of biting my nails and cuticles. I have done this since I was probably 8 years old. It's not some new thing I started just to piss him off, if you can believe it. He has always had a problem with it, even though I've done it the entire time we've known each other. Anyway, he essentially gives me an ultimatum a la ""what kind of consequence do you need to know that I'm serious about this? Why can't you just stop? It's concerning that you have no control over your own body, there is something seriously wrong with that. I can't understand it, it's not normal."" This essentially led to him ignoring me all weekend (this argument happened on Friday night) and he never brought it up again, just eventually began talking to me like nothing happened after ignoring me for 24 hours. My whole weekend was ruined, I couldn't relax or work, or do anything at all other than spiral down the divorce and relationshipadvice subreddits again. Hah, then he has the nerve to ask me why I'm not horny anymore.

So that brings me to right now, writing this all out to document it. I may need it later to prove to myself that I'm not crazy, these things did happen, and that I felt so shitty about them. I'm going to start doing some diary entries like this (not as long, I hope) just to work out some feelings.

But right now, I really want to start making an exit plan. I cringe when he talks about things we should do in the future. I don't see him in it anymore. I daydream - no - I *fantasize* about starting a new life, back where we moved from. Having my own little apartment, no one to clean up after. No one to cook for. Well, that's not entirely true, I actually *like* the idea of inviting a friend over to cook for them. I just can't keep doting on a grown man who acts like he doesn't even realize that dishes need to be cleaned after eating off of them. 

I think of how I will actually go out and do something after work, if I want (and I want). That maybe I'll just read by the pool on a Saturday after I go to the gym. That I'll burn whatever candles I want to keep my home smelling nice. That I'll hang up curtains without getting into a fight about how I don't hold the flashlight the right way when he's trying to use the drill. 

I'll make new friends. I'll have a positive outlook on life. Fuck, maybe I'll stay single for the rest of my life. It sure as hell would beat this.

Was diagnosed with steatosis last summer. 
Dr couldn’t say how severe it was since the radiologist didn’t put it in the report..
My numbers are still in good range. 
But I noticed if I drink even one beer
Or eat too much carbs, or a fast food burger, I’ll have sharp pains in ruq. 
Sometimes it’s just for a moments. 
In the past the longest episode lasted about 45 minutes. Thought I was gonna die..
I notice some foods trigger the sharp pains that take my breath away. 
So just curious for those who know how  severeor  not so severe their liver steatosis is and what degree of pain are you all experiencing? 
And what usually causes flare ups? 
Or inflamed liver to cause your pain? 
Thanks in advance. 

And yes I’ve changed my diet, focusing on losing weight. 
Only 187 but would like to cut weight down. 
I’m drinking coffee, taking garlic, avoiding junk food. Etc. 
I have noticed the sharp painful episodes I was having on a weekly basis is now less often too. 
So hopefully I’m heading in right direction

Yes or no?","Okay so it started off when I was in Brazil with my boyfriend two summers ago. My best friend from childhood passed away in an accident. This was very hard on me. I was really sad and felt so guilty because I had not spoken to him or replied to his texts the prior 3 months because my boyfriend told me I wasn’t allowed to talk to any other men- even my old friends. I left Brazil for the funeral and my boyfriend was hurt that I left because his family lives in Brazil and I was supposed to be staying there to be with them. But I had to go. I remember feeling like my boyfriend didn’t seem to understand how bad this was- losing my friend. I remember feeling very alone at this time and hurting a lot from losing my friend.

Anyway, my boyfriend and I got into a lot of fights while he was in Brazil and I was home. I remember telling him how I felt like he didn’t care for me etc. He told me he was trying to enjoy his time with his family which I get because he rarely gets to see them. But we ended up just having a lot of tension and in the thick of my emotional pain from that I ended up threatening to break up. We threatened this a lot but never seriously. I remember he actually agreed this time. I told him no- that I was just mad and figured like sual we would just get through it. But this time was different. He actually called me and told me basically that he wasn’t sure how we would work etc and how he wanted his kids to be with his family in Brazil one day.This rocked my world. I have never been in such pain. I couldn’t eat. I lost 15 pounds and would not be able to sleep. It was honestly the lowest I had ever been in fear of losing him. We ended up being okay, but I had so much fear now.

Prior to this I thought we were getting engaged that summer. I thought he was going to propose. Then this, where he wanted to break up. He would tell me how he didn’t but for the first time I wasn’t truly sure if he wanted me. He came back to the states and things were really weird. I remember feeling so bad as I had so much fear he would leave me. I was sad that we weren’t engaged yet too. Then when we went back to college (we go to different colleges) things were still very weird. It was like I wasn’t secure in knowing he wanted me. This made me feel so anxious and freaked out. I felt like I was annoying him being like this. Then on top of this, this was my senior year if college and things were very different on campus. My best friend and old roommate moved off campus and I rarely saw her. My sister who was my current roommate was dating someone on campus and therefore was always with this boyfriend. A lot of my close friends graduated. I felt so insanely alone. I remember eating all alone in my dorm everyday. I felt like a weirdo, a loner, like there was something wrong with me. I had lost my best friend in the car accident and truly just felt like I had no friends to hangout with.

I had my boyfriend to text and call but no one on campus to be with. I have always had issues with worrying about how I appear to the world. I didn’t want to be seen as some girl with no social circle- no friends. So I decided to try to make some friends. I would pray to God to help me make friends. Still nothing- all the girls on campus seemed to have a social circle already. After all, I was a senior and no longer seen as someone who needed to get involved with small groups to make friends. I remember trying so hard to talk to people, but nothing would stick. I’m a relatively quiet person, who has always kinda relied on other people to engage with me to become my friend. So it was weird for me to try to make friends.

I remember one day I was walking to class when some guy that I had seen before introduced himself. He just asked my name and major- the typical stuff people do. Then later that day I saw he added me on Instagram. I accepted this, thinking it was “interesting”. This might sound weird but with men I have always kinda assumed when they do this they have a crush or something, but I also go to a Christian college so I was like “maybe he’s just friendly”.

Anyways, time passed and then one day I posted an Instagram story about a Starbucks drink. Like which one was better and people could vote. I remember he commented saying that neither and that Dunkin was better. I remember being happy that he commented because that meant he was like paying attention to me and remembered me. We started a conversation as I told him that Starbucks was way better. He told me that he had never had Starbucks so I told him we had to go then so he could taste how much better it was than Dunkin. I remember being excited thinking this was my chance to make a friend. I have always had an easier time making friends with men than women. Men are easier to make friends with. Usually if they think you’re cute they will want to be your friend. I figured this was the situation with him. That he probably had a crush on me and that’s why he was talking to me. I thought it was interesting though because on my instagram i have tons of pictures with my boyfriend of us kissing etc. So I wasn’t sure what his intentions were because he clearly saw I had a man.

Then I remember that the next day I was going home for the weekend. I deleted the messages and didn’t text him that weekend because I didn’t want my boyfriend to see and be mad saying I couldn’t talk to him. My boyfriend doesn’t want me to have guy friends and has gotten mad in the past if I texted any guy remotely. Then I got back that week and texted this guy again. He just asked how my weekend was etc. I was excited to have a friend on campus that I could hangout with maybe. Someone that would do things with me so I wasn’t alone. I was hoping he would want to be my friend. I then remember texting him and he asked me what I was up to. I just told him I was bored and studying. He asked if I wanted to study with him. I said sure and went to meet him. I remember getting ready to see him and I put some makeup on because I didn’t want him to think I was ugly and gross and not want to be my friend. I then met with him and we studied. He asked me how my summer was and then I told him how it was awful because of losing my best friend. Then I said how it was awful after that too because of everything with my boyfriend. I think I told him this partially because it was the truth, partially because I wanted him to know I had a boyfriend, ad partially a little subconsciously because I wanted him to want to be my friend and thought maybe he would be more inclined in case he kinda liked me and thought my boyfriend and I were having issues. I didn’t know if he liked me or not (like had a crush) but I just know a lot of my past guy friends secretly had a crush on me as they would admit it later and this was why they wanted to be my friend. I think that’s why i was like “well I really want a friend so even if it’s just a guy being my friend because he secretly has a crush at least I get a friend, I don’t care his intentions as long as I get a friend”. I knew that I didn’t find him attractive and would never want to date him so I didn't think I was doing anything wrong.

I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend for him or ever cross a boundary in my mind that would be cheating such as flirting or anything physical. So I was like “if he kinda has a crush maybe he will want to be my friend more, I can just make sure I never reciprocate that crush and it’s fine”. So then he just kinda told me that he was sorry and I was kinda crying without wanting to but talking about all that made me feel emotional. I felt stupid for being so vulnerable but it was just a very hard thing in my life talking about summer as it was awful and traumatic for me. Then he gave me a hug goodbye I think because he felt bad for me for crying. Anyways he texted me and I apologized for crying and breaking down to him when he barely knew me. He said it was fine and he was glad to be there to try to listen. I remember thinking how he is a Christian and was probably just being nice and felt bad for me.

Then days later he saw me getting coffee on campus and started talking to me. I remember being happy because I had someone to drink coffee with on campus. We talked about random things, I told him about one of my girl friends that he could talk to. He told me about his family etc. He then told me about his celebrity crushes as I asked him what his type was to convince him to like my friend. He then asked me mine. I told him some and I wondered if he was doing this because he liked me or what. I just made sure I didn’t flirt with him in the conversation. Then I asked him if he wanted to get Starbucks after class. He said sure that he would pick me up.

On the way there he just talked about random things like where he was from. He then asked how my boyfriend and I were doing. I told him about some of my concerns. When I reflect I think once again I knew telling him this would possibly make him hope we would break up so he could have a chance, but I knew I would never break up with my boyfriend, so I didn’t think it was wrong. I enjoyed having someone listen to me and give me their attention and feel like they cared for me. I would always tell him some issues and follow it up with “but I love him and can’t let him go”. Because these were true concerns. I just kinda got a little dramatic with them acting like these concerns were more serious to me that they really were because I knew I wanted to be with my man and marry him. I lowkey remember thinking about how part of the reason I had anger with my boyfriend was because I just wanted him to propose already because I just wanted to marry him already. I never questioned if I wanted to be with my boyfriend or not at this time.

Anyways, I once again brought up my girl friend to him to make sure he saw that I was setting him up with someone. I tried to see how he responded with this to see if he denied her indicating he liked me. But he said he liked her. I remember being a little worried that if they started dating though that I would be in the same situation I was in before where he would go hangout with her all the time like my sister with her boyfriend and I would be all alone again with no friends to hangout with. This made me feel sad like I didn't want him to date her then. Not because I wanted to date him, but because if he dated someone then I would not have anyone to hangout with agan. He paid for my coffee which I felt was a little weird but my old guy friend used to do that too. I remember sitting drinking coffee and I spilled some on my hand. He cleaned it off with his finger which I thought was kinda weird. But I remember kinda enjoying that he cared for me. I think I was craving human contact and care so much. I never found him attractive. He was honestly like the furthest thing from my type. He also gave me his jacket as we were leaving because it was freezing. I refused to put it on because I felt like that was restricted for my boyfriend. I just sat it on my hands in the car because I didn;t want to be rude to him.

Anyways, I tried to set him up with another friend too. I remember wanting to have him and my boyfriend meet sometime. I wanted them to maybe become friends one day, I just didn't know how to do so without my boyfriend freaking out that I had a male friend. Anyways, I remember one time we were texting and I sent him the softball roster ( I am on the softball team) and asked him which one he would want me to set him up with. I remember he said none of them were really his type and I was like “hmm maybe he really doesn’t find me attractive, interesting” because most of my guy friends would have been like “I like one of them but she has a man (indicating me). I remember being like “dang maybe I’m ugly” but then I was like no, I don’t want him anyways.

Anyways, I told my boyfriend the following week about everything that happened. I had looked up online if having a guy friend was wrong and people kept saying that keeping it a secret was wrong so that's when I told him. I didn’t want to do anything wrong or hurt my boyfriend. I loved my boyfriend, I just really wanted a friend at this time to hang out with. I also remember thinking that if my boyfriend and I broke up I would never date this friend, but it would be nice to have someone there as a friend to be there for me. This guy friend was very unattractive to me, and when I truly reflect I didn’t even really care about who he was as a person. I didn’t pay attention to what he said or what made him him, I just liked that he paid attention to me.

When I told my boyfriend I immediately stopped being friends with this guy. I noticed that I didn’t care that I was no longer friends with him- like it didn’t hurt me to cut him out of my life at all. i have so much fear because i looked stuff up and it said stuff about cheating. i never in the moment thought i was crossing the line into cheating in my head because I thought i was keeping boundaries so now i am so freaked out. i have been so distraught the past year waking up every morning worried about if i cheated. i have thought about it every second of every day in fear.

We’ve lived together for about a year, and overall, it’s been fine. However, lately, something strange has been happening. It started about a month ago when I noticed that some of our furniture and decorations had changed positions when I came home. At first, I thought it was my imagination, but it kept happening.

One night, I came home from work to find our coffee table moved, and a picture frame that used to be on the wall now sitting on the counter. I asked Kate about it, but she just laughed it off, saying I was probably just forgetting where I put things. I started to feel like I was going crazy, especially when I caught a glimpse of myself in the hallway mirror and swore my reflection stared back at me longer than it should have.

Then, a week ago, I walked into our living room, and the layout was completely different. The couch was on a different wall, and the TV was missing altogether! I freaked out and confronted Kate. She rolled her eyes and said that I had been stressed and was just misremembering things. At this point, I felt totally alone in my experience. She refused to acknowledge the weird occurrences, and it began to drive a wedge between us.

Last night was the breaking point. I woke up to strange noises—like whispers and mechanical sounds—emanating from the living room. I got out of bed, and as I walked toward the source, I found that the furniture had rearranged itself again. The couch was now facing a wall that had never been there before. I panicked, feeling that reality itself was shifting around me. I turned to Kate for support, but she just laughed, saying I needed to stop watching weird sci-fi shows.

In frustration, I told Kate that her denial was unbearable. I said I couldn’t live with someone who wouldn’t even acknowledge the bizarre changes happening in our home. In a heated argument, I accused her of gaslighting me. She scoffed and said I was overreacting. In a moment of anger, I told her she needed to move out.

She was taken aback, visibly hurt, and stormed off to her room. I didn’t think she’d actually leave, but this morning she texted me, saying she found a new place and would be moving out next week. I decided to text my friends about it and they seem to agree that I'm not just seeing things as a few of them stated they know a bit about ""glitches in the matrix"", whatever that means. I decided to side with my other friend who knows about paranormal stuff.

So, I went out for coffee after texting my friends this morning. I ended up seeing Kate out shopping with her friends while on a walk to the library after my coffee and I overheard them talking about me. They were saying stuff like ""he's probably on drugs or something"" and ""maybe he doesn't get any sleep."" Kate just nodded as she walked by, not even a simple ""hi"" or anything.

When I got to the library I was overwhelmed with anxiety. I couldn't believe her friends thought I was on drugs of all things. I was so upset I ended up reading my entire bag of books I had just borrowed, I had to get more in the end. I decided to go to the bathroom and catch up on my texts when I saw that my friends has texted me telling me a few of her friends had disagreed with her and had joined my side of the debate. I was so happy I completely forgot to use the bathroom and went home instead.

It was halfway to the walk home when I got a rush of guilt. I didn't know how long it was eating away, but now I felt it. I sat down on a nearby bench and thought for an hour, just sitting there. So I remembered what I used to do when I needed help, I went to reddit. Here I am guys—am I the asshole for kicking her out over something that might just be in my head?

UPDATE: I got a text from one of my roommate's friends. She said we can meet at my place and explain everything, in which I agreed. When I got there she told me to head in and set my bag down so she can explain. I was worried at first, but she continued to say that my roommate had paid her friends to scare me into moving out so her new boyfriend can move in. The landlord is kind of strict about more than 2 people living there, so that's why she wanted me out. She continued to say that my room would've been turned into Kate's ""makeup/model"" room, what a waste of space.

To you guys telling me to get an outdoor camera, the landlord is the only one with access to it anyways, for an indoor camera, I agree that I should buy that. Also, my lack of sleep due to studying and staying up late to read may be what cause me to see a delay in the mirror, it has been happening recently with several objects.",9,1745982403.0,AITA_WIBTA_PUBLIC,15,0.62,False

It's a mix of how the world feels like it's up in flames, dissatisfaction with my job, and my relationship with my boyfriend. The anxiety is mostly coming up in my relationship, but honestly now that I reflect it feels like that's just a cop out. I overall don't feel okay. I feel isolated, empty, restless, and numb. My normal escapes from reality make it worse. I don't enjoy being on my phone or watching shows. I try to get back into my hobbies but honestly just lazy about it (this one is definitely on me, kinda been like that for awhile). Hell even being around people doesn't always appeal to me. Like the idea sounds nice and I do enjoy it, but the moment there's a lul of some kind I feel restless. I want to do something, I'm filled with anxiousness when I do nothing but im not even motivated to do something!! Daily tasks feel like a chore sometimes. You know when you have to clean the bathroom and you dread it a bit kind of laziness. I sometimes feel that, but other times there's something more. It doesn't just feel like laziness but like the inability to do so. I know I can and I know it won't take long, but i don't. So I end up feeling ""wrong"". I feel wrong when I'm with my boyfriend. I feel wrong when I'm at work. I feel wrong when talking to my friends. I feel wrong in my own skin and when I fall asleep. I'm in therapy, I recently started with someone new so I have to build up that repor. 

Anyone ever feel like this? What do you do when you feel ""wrong""? I still find joys in things so it's not like completely sad.  I like going on walks when the weather is nice. I like getting myself coffee as a treat. I like talking about the new audiobooks I listen to. I still have joys, I just notice the wrong a lot more",2,1745982315.0,therapy,0,1.0,False

**Interviews**: I interviewed for all my target/reach schools. All the interviews went pretty well, but there were a couple stand outs.

* Bates: My interviewer was a 70-year-old librarian, and she was so sweet. We met in person at a coffee shop and talked for around 2 hours.

* Washington and Lee: I came in super interested in W&L and I was considering applying ED. We met a local coffee shop, and my interviewer (an Asian CS major) told me the school was a terrible place for POCs and spent an hour hating on the Greek system. Definitely dodged a bullet there…

**Essays**: My personal statement was pretty great, I had a really good idea and spent around 4-5 hours on it. I spent around 1 hour per supplemental, but many of my schools had the same prompts, so I just copy pasted essays or did minor edits.

**Tips/Takeaways:**

1. SHOTGUN EVERYWHERE!!! I thought I was absolutely cooked and wouldn’t get anywhere good because of my low GPA and SAT, but I ended up getting up into multiple schools with <20% acceptance rates. Apply to every reach you possibly can and hope for the best. Imagine if I didn’t apply to Bates, URoch, Colorado College.
2. Applying to 50 schools isn’t as difficult as it may seem. Many of my colleges had very similar essay prompts, so I was able to reuse essays a lot. I think I only had to write 10-12 fully unique essays.
3. If you’re applying to top LACs, demonstrate lots of interest! For all my reaches that consider demonstrated interest, I interviewed, attended an information session, and opened every email they sent. I believe this really helped.
4. The day before my interview for Haverford (my ED1 school), I booked an interview at a safety school (Whitman College) for practice. This definitely improved my confidence, and I left a lot less nervous. I would highly recommend you do this.
5. Low ranked private schools are the best safeties! Knox College was my cheapest option ($19,000 per year COA), and it’s half the price of my 'safety' state school.
6. Don't spend a cent on application fees for your safeties! Scoir has called ‘Free Applications’. I applied to pretty much every school there (Most have no essays, so it takes like 5 mins per application) and got a lot of competitive offers.",4,1745982291.0,collegeresults,1,0.83,False

So, not even 2 months ago, I had this huge argument with my dad about my weed consumption.  Well, it was mostly him arguing and me laughing in his face. He found out I was still using edible and called me a liar and a phony and told me I was never gonna get better. The thing is, I've quit using harder drugs a while back, and to me, weed wasn't even a concern. I thought he was being over the top. It's weed. you're a close-minded dinosaurs is what I was thinking while he was going off on me. But anyways due to mental health and bad credit to find a place, i decided to move into sober living, and because I agreed to random  drug testing, I had to quit. Now, if you wanna quit weed, I'm telling you the fact that if i smoke weed, I won't have a roof over my head made it really easy to do. Im not saying it's easy, but since it was a matter  of housing to me, it just went ok. im not smoking weed anymore, and that was that.

Here's what 6 weeks off weed had taught me. I sleep like shit. I usually could drink as much caffeine any time I wanted. I couldn't  do this anymore. No more caffeine after 3 pm. I love coffee, so that part kinda suck a bit. And I dream a lot, and it's super vivid, so maybe that's why i can't sleep. I don't know. 

But, here's the good part! My memory has improved. I don't get lost in the middle of a conversation, thinking what was i saying again?"" I'm not as delusional as I was. I thought my delhusion were due to me being mentally hill. Nope! Since I quit weed, I do not have thease false beliefs of external reality anymore. I see life as is it not as I want it to be. In situations of stress, I used to get super disregulated and would think oh I need to roll a joint to calm my nerves."" It turns out the disrugulation was cause by the weed. Because I don't get this sensory overloaded anxiety anymore.  I have more energy,  I don't spend hours dissociating on my phone, and I actually have the motivation to do the things I have to do.

So I don't know. Im not telling you weed is bad, and you should quit. But Im telling you I don't regret doing it.",1,1745982244.0,HowToStopSmokingWeed,0,1.0,False

-Delilah is too work focused to realize the toons are actually human with emotions too. She doesn't mean to hurt them but she can't understand how they feel because she views everything as work

-Delilah is dead. She had accidentally turned one of the mains (Dandy or Pebble) into a twisted and the result killed her. that's why the newspaper about Gardenview shutting down only mentioned speaking to Arthur, Delilah is dead. 

-Connie is (was) a Halloween event toon but escaped and so Delilah went ""Yeah I'm tired of this you can be free"", however Connie feels bad about the others and there's some resentment

-Dandy collects tapes because those are old episodes. He doesn't want to let go of the past therefore gets really pissed off when you "" withhold"" them from him, ie not spend the tapes.

This was my first superautomatic espresso machine, and I was genuinely excited. Unfortunately, I ended up returning after 30 days—for three main reasons—and I’m hoping the community can help me find something that might be a better fit.

1. **Drink Temperature:** Even with the temperature turned all the way up, the coffee and milk drinks were always a bit cooler than I’d like.
2. **Constant Self-Cleaning:** The machine seemed to clean itself obsessively—several times a day—even when barely used. It felt excessive.
3. **Tray Management:** Tied to #2, the drip tray filled up fast. With 4–6 drinks per day, we had to empty the tray daily, which became a hassle.

BTW I did love the look of it on the counter. I got it in white.. and more importantly my wife liked the look of it.

I know some self-cleaning is standard for superautos, but is this level typical? Do all machines require the tray to be emptied this often? Or is there a more efficient option out there?

1-I should've explained ir better but my restriction order was a temporal one, only for 30 days.
2-Peter was a very good husband. I read that he was abusive all throughout our relationship, he wasn't. And he was a good dad to Jack. Everything went to hell when I caught him cheating.
3-What Jack was saying wasn't told by Peter, I talked to him and I made sure, he just has been missing our life before.
4-Peter would NEVER touch Jack like some of you suggested. My case may make it seem like he could, but he never even touched me or groomed me. I did talk to Jack, just to make sure, and he reassured me nothing happened.

Now, onto the update. I did meet with Peter, most of you told me not to go to his apartment so I told him to meet at a park, take a walk, or something. When I saw him, he was different. He looked very depressed and he hugged me when he saw me. He wouldn't stop apologizing for what happened.

We started talking and walking, he didn't justify what he said or did, but he did say he regrets it. He said that he misses me and misses being together. I asked about Allison and he told me that he cut her and his parents out, which I believe he did, and then I asked about what he said about Jack. He basically said that he resented Jack for a long time because my attention wasn't on him anymore, and it was selfish, but he was too used to be the center of my world so when it suddenly changed, he couldn't take it. He told me he loves Jack but that he sustains that if giving him up meant to have me back, he would do it in a heartbeat.

We talked for hours while Jack was with my friend, I cried a lot, there were things I decided not to ask like if he was drugging me like some of you said, because I honestly don't want to know. We have been texting these past days, mostly about Jack, but I'm considering family therapy, mostly to help Jack cope with everything. The divorce is still happening which Peter wasn't too happy about but he wasn't angry anymore, just sad.

I also recently met a guy in a coffee shop and we have been texting a lot so I'll see how that turns out. And that's it for the moment, I'll update you guys if you have many questions or if something else happens.",9,1745981088.0,AITAH,4,0.91,False

Any thoughts to share?

Splurge:

Wall Hacking: Can totally change the layout and flow of a space

Custom Cabinetry /Storage only for odd shaped, non-standard layouts (mansionettes or landed with staircase in the middle of the house) or very high ceilings etc: This can really help with storage of belongings to fully maximise the space.

Heavy use furniture: Spend more and scrutinize /test big items that are meant to be heavy use, ie . Living Room Sofa, Study Table, Dining table, Mattresses. Avoid buying unless you can see/ test the real product, don't just rely on online reviews.

Aircon:  Best stick to established Japanese brands. Save you alot of maintenance costs /replacement costs down the road.

Electrical sockets: Need to plan beforehand, as its very tricky and costly to rewire later.

Ceiling Fans: Absolutely a must in our weather unless you intend to turn on air-con all the time. Relying on standing fans works only in smaller areas.

Save:

Going overboard on custom carpentry when there is no need to. Seen so many examples of homes aspiring to be ""Muji"", ""Aesop"", luxury hotels and boutiques but the end results look nothing like the inspiration and looks worse than the sum of its parts.

Feature walls: Not necessary, just use a fresh coat of paint and/or add a cheap painting/artwork can achieve similar effects for a fraction of the cost.

Secondary use furniture: Coffee tables, bed side tables, armchairs or accent chairs, benches. No need to spend too much

Flooring: Vinyl overlay is good enough for most cases, except for kitchen /wet areas.

Bathtub or similar feature in shower: White elephant, hard to maintain over time.",1,1745980884.0,askSingapore,4,1.0,False

Now I’m talking in generalities and averages so I’m not here to argue about exceptions. 

What I’m here to debate about his female standards particularly beautiful women and how there’s no real reason for them to lower their high standards. 

In this case let’s say an objectively beautiful woman is some where between girl next door beautiful (7-7.5 out of 10) to drop dead gorgeous (10 out of 10). 

From probably the age of 14 these women have been pursued heavily for long term relationships by high status men. They were pursed by the high status jocks who had a BMW and daddy’s money when in high school and they’re pursed by mid 6 figure investment bankers as grown women. So naturally they’re used to a certain lifestyle. 

Where I think the problem comes in is the average men with little resources and status still believes the objective 7.5-8/10 woman is obtainable to him. Let me give a hypothetical:

*25 year old man (5-6/10) making 50k a year sees woman (7.5/10) he believes she’s the hottest woman in this bar. He approaches, chats her up and asks for her number. Curious she accepts. She thinks he dresses nice. It appears he might have resources. I’ll have to learn more about him to find out. They’re texting back and forth he takes the initiative to set up a date. It’s a coffee date. That’s weird. All her previous boyfriends took her to 4 star restaurants on the first date. Anyway she has 3-4 other men in her phone who seem sweet and are eager to take her out to something a lot fancier than coffee. She ghosts him. Naturally he becomes angry. Goes on about how all women want is money but wait! He’s also superficial. He just wanted her because she was the most beautiful woman in the bar.*

There seems to be a common sentiment among men who are frustrated with dating that women seem to be money obsessed. In reality, most women learn at a very early age what they can “get” out of men. The majority of below average and average women are under no illusion that they can snag a wealth or high status man. The problem only arises when the average man thinks a 7-8 woman is in his league in reality her DMs are most likely filled with high status men asking her out. 

And frankly they shouldn’t be shamed for the preference. They’re using what they were blessed with (naturally or otherwise) to give a
man what he wants so she can secure resources for her and her offspring in the long term. 

I think a lot of people would be happier if they learned to date within their tax bracket for men and within their looks bracket for women. ",0,1745980750.0,PurplePillDebate,32,0.42,False

Both incidents were 100% my fault and could have been avoided. 

The first incident she was a couple of weeks old, I was extremely sleep deprived. She lost weight at my breast and had to go on formula bottles. She was allergic to cow’s milk and hated the formula, so she would just barely drink enough to fill her belly and be comfortable. This was after the first week of pretty much not sleeping because she was so hungry her body wouldn’t rest. Her infancy was HARD for a multitude of reasons. 

Fast forward, I’m in the mother’s room at buy buy baby sobbing because the bottle I made at home was in the insulation pocket and still too hot and she  was screaming to eat. I was on the phone with her father (whom I have since left) and he was telling me I was NOT allowed to give her my breast, scared she would refuse the bottles again. I cried that the bottle was too hot. I kept trying to pour it back and forth into an empty one- still too hot. I was panicking, escalating, after several minutes of trying to cool it down and her screaming, I gave up and cried and tried to give it to her. Her little body went into shock. She pulled off the nipple and went to sleep. I cried even harder after that, not knowing why on earth I listened to him, wishing I had put her on my breast. I was genuinely too scared not to listen to him, and I hurt her by giving her the hot bottle. 

She ended up with a swallowing disorder and not diagnosed for several months, but I wondered somehow if it was my fault. What if I burned her little flap that was supposed to keep the liquid out of her lungs and it was my fault in addition to the pain she felt? How bad was the pain? She didn’t scream, her eyes got huge, her body jolted, and she pulled off the nipple and slept. I’ll never forget the look on her face and feeling like the worst mother that ever lived. I’ve cried many times since then, and she is currently 5- almost 6 years old now. 

The other time was almost one year later. I gave her mashed potatoes from a restaurant without testing them first, and she screamed/panicked that they were hot on her tongue. I quickly brushed it off of her tongue and felt it was hot. I wondered how on earth I managed to hurt her not once, but twice, both with hot items. 

I’ve never hurt her in any other way. I do not hit my child, and I’ve gone above and beyond since to make sure I don’t give her hot food.

My problem is that when I remember these events, which are admittedly less often now, I feel sick. I wish it had been me that was burned instead. I remember after the first incident happened I wanted to go home, boil water, and force myself to drink it off the stove. I never did, because I knew that was a horrible intrusive thought that would fix nothing. 

I also felt incredibly suicidal after the first incident. I felt like I was the worst human for bringing a baby into the world only to hurt her, and to give her such a shitty father. It was so hard on me. I don’t know how hot it actually was in retrospect, maybe like a hot cup of coffee. 

I do not know how to forgive myself. I am happy that I am still here and I am so happy she is my daughter, but I fear this incidents will haunt me for the rest of my life. I do not know how to progress mentally past these feelings of almost being an imposter because- WHO hurts their kids by negligence???? I did. And it hurts me deeply. ",1,1745980487.0,Mom,1,1.0,False

1kb5ug8,https://www.reddit.com/r/depression/comments/1kb5ug8/i_feel_ashamed/,I feel ashamed,"I'm so ashamed of the life I'm currently living. I want you all to judge me. Psychiatrists say my childhood is at fault. But is it really? I'm currently turning 19. I was supposed to be finishing my last year of high school yet here I am. I haven't stepped foot there in 3 months. I tried twice during those months but felt like shit after each attempt. I have no one anymore besides my boyfriend which I depend on too much. I've always had difficulties with school with my siblings ever since we moved countries 10 years ago, we were raised in my mother's country but had to suddenly move because of my father's ""homesickness"" towards his country. Ever since we arrived here everything has gone down hill. Me and my siblings all developed severe issues the main one being isolation. My parents always worked, My sister being older like me also had difficulties adjusting to this different environment and authority (my grandma) and my brother was younger but still kind of in the same boat. Growing up until that point our parents never really disciplined us because my older sister had cancer when I was 3. She had a 10% chance of survival. They were devastated. My earliest of memories of life revolve around this tragedy. I can still remember myself clinging onto my mother whenever she had to leave to take care of our sister in the hospital. I would only see her once a month or every few months. I even ran after her one time while she was driving away. So basically from ages to 3-5 me and my brother didn't really have a mother hell he thought our grandma was his mother. During those difficult times my dad was again also absent because he had to work to pay for my sister's medical bills because we were and are still in debt. After my parents experienced that life changing event. Before and even after my sister got better, they would never tell us no, and they would spoil us like crazy with gifts attention etc as much as they could. Because they were afraid. Because they wanted us to be happy. Because they wanted us to forget. Because they wanted to make it up to us. But it was wrong. We never learnt rules. Those problems  hadn't manifested until we retuned to my father's country. They were absent again. So we were children who were thrown into an unfamiliar environment with no one to guide us. When our parents finally tried to intervene it was too late. My sister was already supposed to be in puberty but she couldn't even enter it because of the damage chemotherapy had caused to her body so she was a very angry child with a lot of resentment. Understandably so. I was already failing primary school because of the anxiety and depression I developed while being neglected. Not on purpose of course, everything they did they did for us. But the damage was still done. At this point my siblings and I were already in the process of isolating ourselves in our rooms. My sister and I used to be best friends until we moved here. We would play for hours together on end. But when we got here I'd bang on her door and cry for attention. She had completely closed off from everyone even me. I started being rebellious around this time I would get my brother and cause mischief all the time focusing especially more on my sister. I would have him piss on her door what the fuck was wrong with me. Despite just being a child when doing all of this silly stuff even when it was just my brother sometimes and not me I would be the one getting beaten with a stick by my grandma and not much later by my father when he saw that my absence marks weren't getting any better and that all of his children were out of control. All of this happened in the span of the first weeks here. So life was just my sister in her room closed off from everyone. Me doing the same while not attending school. My brother also participating in this but at a slower pace as he was younger and a boy. Every week my father would round us all up and scream at us call us useless and give us a speech about 2 hours infront of our frail and weak spoken mother who didn't dare intervene. Not much later my mom got cancer. My sister and I were teenagers so we had a perfect understanding of what was happening at the time. My father hadn't changed, in fact he had become worse because of the stress. It would be verbal abuse everyday. And when my mother got discharged she would have to face it too. Our family was in shambles. My father had his good moments but his bad ones overshadowed them big time. By the time he had started getting better it was too late. The damage had been done. My sister was already graduating. We would just avoid him whenever we walked past him in the house. Despite his moments he still tried his hardest with our mom to provide the best for us. I would always surely fail the year but they made it possible for me to pass with psychiatrist papers etc until well.. high school, it was harder to bypass the law with high school or to reason with them. But that was when I met Eve. The person that despite not even trying got me through my first two years. She was and still is my best fiend the person that just clicks with me. Whenever I didn't attend school she would come to my house and convince me to come back whenever I dreaded going she was there. The bad thing though was that eve was a year ahead of me. So when I entered my final year, eve had graduated. I thought I could handle this. So I tried a month in I was already having difficulties. I had lost all motivation, I had no friends there anymore. And whenever I tried to befriend someone I would realise that I just don't click with them and they were finding me bothersome since the groups had already formed. So I asked my parents if I could change schools maybe then I could find friends who could encourage me. At the time I discussed this also with my boyfriend Jay, jay and I had met in my second year of HS by pure coincidence. That's when he suggested to me that I transfer to his school. we both thought it was a great idea and my parents reluctantly agreed. The problem was that jay's high school was hours away so I would have to wake up at 5 am in the morning to take the bus and then still be late because it's never on time. Soon I started losing classes again but not because I didn't want to go but because the bus made it impossible. I started having anxiety attacks each morning because I thought my past was gonna catch up to me again. So after a long discussion my parents and I had decided it would be best if I moved there into an apartment so I wouldn't lose any more lessons. Long story short my parents decide to move back to mom's country because of job opportunities and they take my minor brother with them but leave me since I'm in my final year so I can just finish it. They didn't realise though that the cycle had started again even though I was attending the school I couldn't find anyone again to make friends with. A girlfriend. I was also way behind my peers in terms of education because I had gaps because of my previous years of no attendance. It all started building up and by the time they were gone it was the beginning of the end. I had started spiralling again. I had no one. My mom was the one that gave me confidence and now she was gone and so was eve. I had jay but it isn't the same. I don't understand why Jay hasn't given up on me or loves me. My spark is gone. So what does he see? All I've done these past 3 months is just bed rot. I'm too ashamed to go out I'm afraid of people seeing me. Especially my classmates because whenever I came back after taking time off they would attack me. I hate them. I hate this place. I've only got my dog and jay. I can barely take care of myself. Jay has been taking care of me for the past three months even though I don't deserve it. He walks the dog, brings me coffee EVERY SINGLE DAY. And yet I do nothing. I have no energy to do anything. I just want to be free. I know I'm not going back to high school. I don't know what my options are. Only my mom and jay know about this. I've told jay im planning to join my parents in my mothers country and maybe finish school there if it's possible. He wants to come with me. I don't know what I've done to deserve this man. Even though I was good to him when I was okay does that even cover these past 3 months? I've been a demon. An energy sucking demon. He says I'm not and that he loves me just as I am, but to be frank im kind of concerned with how okay he is with all of this. I think joining my parents is the only way to somehow get out of cycle. I need their support I don't want to rely solely on Jay, enough is enough. What I'm really trying to say is that I feel horrible. My parents left me behind with the expectations that I finish. They paid rent every month for me to finish. And yet I've accomplished nothing. Absolutely nothing. I'm completely useless. Everyone around me thinks I'm this strong person who lives on her own and is trying to finish school on her own. But I'm not. I'm just some loser who can't even feed herself, get out of bed herself. Can't even go to school for a year. I know I'm probably going to get better if I join them but man I'm so ashamed, I even was on the verge of committing multiple times. I just feel so weak. What's the point of me even surviving ? I can't even express my feelings without crying. How am I supposed to survive in the real world? Nothing has changed since primary school. I'm still this person. I'm just better at hiding it.",1,1745980200.0,depression,0,1.0,False
1kb5tga,https://youtu.be/Xo1OEYtrkOU,3 Very Scary TRUE Missing Hiker Horror Stories,"""**The Vanishing at Spence Field**"":

June 14, 1969. It was Father’s Day weekend, and the kind of morning that made you believe the world was at peace. The sky over the Great Smoky Mountains was washed in blue, the sun just cresting the ridgelines and filtering golden light through the tall canopy of oak and fir. The scent of pine needles, moss, and blooming wildflowers drifted through the cool mountain air, sharp and fresh, the way only the wilderness could offer. Everything felt right.

We were full of excitement, the kind that buzzes quietly just beneath the surface. My wife Violet had packed everyone’s things with care, double-checking the boys’ jackets and canteens. Our sons, Dennis and Doug, were practically vibrating with energy. Dennis, only six, was on his first real camping trip—one where we'd hike deep into the mountains, sleep in tents, cook over open flame, and chase fireflies as the night settled around us. His red T-shirt practically glowed in the morning light, and his green shorts seemed to blur as he darted up the trail ahead of us, calling back over his shoulder.

“Dad, look at the mountains!” he shouted, his finger outstretched toward the sea of green ridges rolling off into the distance.

I smiled as I adjusted the straps on my pack. “Pretty cool, huh? Stay close, buddy,” I said, though I already knew he wouldn’t—at least not for long. That’s how six-year-olds are, especially when they’re tasting real freedom for the first time.

Doug, who had just turned nine, trotted along behind us with a sort of older-brother superiority. “You’re so slow, Dennis,” he teased, kicking a rock off the path and watching it bounce into the underbrush.

Dennis only laughed, undeterred, and ran back toward me, his small hand finding mine. He looked up at me with those wide, dark brown eyes, full of life and curiosity, his cheeks flushed from the mountain air. I remember thinking: this—this is what it’s all about.

Our trail started at Cades Cove, a place where the meadows stretched out like green blankets beneath the watchful gaze of the mountains. We hiked toward Russell Field, where we’d make camp for the night. The woods were alive with birdsong—warblers, woodpeckers, the occasional crow—and the sound of the wind teasing the trees. Every once in a while, we’d hear a branch crack under the foot of a deer or the scurry of a squirrel racing up a trunk. Life was everywhere.

That night, as the fire crackled and the darkness swallowed the woods beyond our campsite, we sat together roasting marshmallows. The sweet smell of sugar melting over flames filled the air. My father, Clyde, sat beside me, gazing into the firelight with a nostalgic sort of softness.

“Remember when we used to do this?” he asked quietly, his voice warm and gravelly.

“Yeah,” I said, watching the boys chase fireflies just outside the circle of light. “Now it’s their turn.”

We didn’t need to say much more. Sometimes it’s enough to just share a silence like that.

The next morning broke clear and bright. The dew still clung to the grass, glistening in the sunlight. We made our way to Spence Field, a grassy clearing high up in the Smokies, just off the Appalachian Trail. You could see for miles from there—rolling ridges and valleys painted in every shade of green, with distant peaks fading into blue. It felt untouched, pure.

Another family had already arrived—the Carters, with two boys close in age to ours. The kids wasted no time, as kids do. Within minutes, they were running around together like lifelong friends, giggling and plotting games with the urgency only children possess. They decided on hide-and-seek. Dennis was thrilled.

“Dennis, don’t go far,” I said as he took off toward the edge of the clearing, glancing back with a mischievous grin.

“Okay, Dad!” he called, already halfway to the tree line.

We watched as the kids darted behind bushes and trees. Every so often, one would pop out, laughing or shouting “found you!” I remember checking my watch. It was about 11:30. A perfect morning. Nothing felt wrong.

Until it did.

Doug reappeared, cheeks red, eyes bright. The Carter boys ran out from their hiding places. But Dennis didn’t. We waited, at first amused, thinking he was just being clever. But as the seconds ticked by, that amusement turned into unease.

“Dennis! Come on out, the game’s over!” I shouted, walking toward the spot I’d last seen him. Nothing. No giggle, no rustling leaves. Just the wind.

“Violet, you see him?” I asked, glancing around, my voice already tinged with tension.

She stood frozen for a second, then pointed. “He was right there, behind that bush.”

We began calling his name, louder and louder. Clyde began checking behind trees, calling out. I broke into a jog, then a run, scanning the tree line, my pulse rising with every step. The Carters joined in. Their oldest boy started crying. Five minutes passed. Then ten. The forest was silent except for the frantic voices calling Dennis’s name.

My heart pounded in my ears. I yelled again, my voice cracking. “Dennis!”

Violet came up behind me, her hand clutching my sleeve. “He wouldn’t just run off, William. He wouldn’t.”

“I know,” I said, barely able to speak. “I know. But we need to keep looking.”

We scoured the field and the trails leading away from it. We checked behind logs, inside bushes, along creeks. No red shirt. No footprints in the dirt. No broken twigs, no candy wrappers, no sign that a little boy had ever been there. It was like he’d been plucked from the earth.

Tom Carter offered to run back to the ranger station. “I’ll go,” he said. “We need help.”

“Please,” I said, gripping his shoulder. “Hurry.”

Rangers arrived by mid-afternoon. Ranger Harris, a tall, wiry man with a calm demeanor, stepped forward, his notepad in hand. “When did you last see him?”

“Right around 11:30. He was maybe 50 feet away. He was just hiding—then he was gone.”

“We’ll set up a grid search,” Harris said. “We’ve got protocols for this. We’ll find him.”

But nothing in the world felt like a guarantee anymore. More rangers showed up, then volunteers, and soon the field was a hive of movement—men with radios, dogs, maps, flashlights. I remember seeing the helicopter rise up over the trees that evening, the thumping of its blades echoing like a heartbeat.

The sun sank behind the mountains, and shadows took over. Spence Field, which had seemed so alive and open that morning, now felt cold and vast. Violet clutched Doug tightly. He was crying into her shoulder.

“Is Dennis lost, Dad?” he asked me, his voice small.

“We’re gonna find him,” I said. But my voice trembled.

I didn’t sleep that night. I just sat in the dark, listening. The forest was too quiet. Every rustle made me jump. I thought I heard whispers in the wind, imagined footsteps beyond the trees. But it was just the mountain. Or maybe not.

By morning, the search doubled in size. The National Guard came. Green Berets. Dozens, then hundreds of people combed the area, calling out, scanning the ground. I walked until my legs gave out, my throat raw from shouting. I listened for a laugh, a cry, anything. But there was only silence.

On the third day, the rain came. A cold, unrelenting downpour that soaked everything and turned the dirt trails into rivers of mud. Fog rolled in like a ghost, wrapping the mountain in silence and gray. Harris found me near a creek, my clothes soaked through, my boots squelching in the mud.

“The rain’s making it worse,” he said. “It’s washing everything away. Tracks, scent trails. All of it.”

I stared into the woods, then back at him. “He’s out there,” I said. “He’s out there. You have to keep looking.”

“We are,” he said. But his eyes were tired, the kind of tired that comes when you start to lose hope.

Someone found a shred of red fabric caught on a thorn bush. My heart skipped. I ran over, breath caught in my throat.

“It’s not the same material,” Harris said, gently holding it out. “Sorry.”

Another volunteer thought she heard laughter echoing from deep in the woods. We ran toward it, machetes in hand, cutting through brush and bramble. But there was nothing. Just trees and silence. False hope can break you worse than fear.

The days blurred. One became five. Five became ten. More than 1,400 people joined the search. Nothing. Not a footprint. Not a thread. Not a whisper. Just emptiness. Theories started to spread—he got lost, fell, was taken. Some rangers whispered about wild animals. Others, about something worse.

After sixteen days, Harris sat us down. His voice was low, careful. “We’ve covered every inch we can. We’re scaling back.”

Violet broke. She sobbed into my chest, and I couldn’t hold myself up. I collapsed with her. I wanted to scream, to tear into the mountains and rip the truth from them. But they were silent.

We packed up. Left the field. Left the camp. Left part of our hearts behind. At home, nothing was right. The world kept turning, but slower. Every knock on the door, every phone ring—hope would flare and die.

In 1985, a ginseng hunter claimed he found a child’s skeleton deep in the park. Rangers searched, but they found nothing. In 2022, the FBI released old case files. Still no answers.

It’s been more than fifty years. We never found Dennis. Never knew if he got lost, if he was taken, if the mountains simply swallowed him whole. The not-knowing is the heaviest weight.



Sometimes, I still dream of him. His red shirt, his laugh, his hand in mine. Sometimes I hear his voice in the woods behind our house. Then I wake up. And it’s just the wind again. The wind, and the ache.







**""The Bearings of Belanglo"":**

Orienteering has always been more than just a hobby for me—it’s a way of thinking, a way of being. Give me a topographic map, a compass, and a thick forest, and I’ll disappear for hours, chasing bearings, plotting points, solving nature like a living maze. There’s something about reading the land, matching every ridge and contour line to the world beneath my boots, that just makes sense. Some people meditate. I hike and navigate.

On September 19, 1992, a cool Saturday morning, my buddy Sam and I loaded our gear into his clunky old Toyota—rust around the wheel wells, cassette deck jammed on a Midnight Oil tape—and headed out to Belanglo State Forest. We were looking for new terrain, something more challenging than the usual parks and reserves near Sydney. Belanglo had a reputation among bushwalkers—dense, wild, untouched in parts. Perfect for an all-day orienteering challenge. The drive took about two hours, the kind of time that melts away with the right company. Sam never shut up—always cracking jokes, arguing about what snack was best for the trail (he swore by barbecue Shapes, I stuck to scroggin), and teasing me about my obsession with laminated maps.

The forest greeted us with that sharp, spicy scent of eucalyptus and the quiet hum of remoteness. The parking area wasn’t much—just a wide patch of dirt off a service road—but to us, it was the starting line. Sam pulled his compass out like he was drawing a sword. “Today’s gonna be great, mate,” he said, lobbing a warm water bottle at me. “Bet I beat you to the first checkpoint.”

I laughed, shaking my head. “You got turned around at Lane Cove, remember? We had to follow dog tracks out.”

He grinned and took off down the trail, boots kicking up dust. I checked my map one last time, dialed in my azimuth, and followed him in. The light filtered through the high canopy in slanted rays, and the underbrush was thick enough to slow us but not enough to obscure the land features. We placed our first few flags—nothing fancy, just bright orange streamers tied to low branches—and took notes on the terrain. It was everything we’d hoped for: gullies, rocky outcrops, and enough quiet that the birds sounded like they were performing just for us.

About an hour in, we were well off the established path. We’d cut east by northeast to a low ridge that should’ve led us to a dry creek bed, and I was adjusting our route when Sam stopped. He wasn’t laughing anymore. He stood still, staring about twenty meters ahead into the brush.

“Hold up, Alex,” he said, squinting. “What’s that over there?”

I followed his gaze. Just beyond the ridge, a mound lay beneath a loose covering of branches and dried leaves. It wasn’t shaped like any fallen tree or scrub pile. Too symmetrical. Too deliberate. Something about it looked... wrong. Like someone had tried to make it look accidental and just missed the mark.

“Probably just a pile of storm debris,” I offered, but I didn’t believe it. There was a tightness in my chest. A quiet alarm.

Then came the smell. It didn’t hit all at once, just sort of crept in like a sour fog—rot, wet earth, something organic breaking down in a way the forest couldn’t disguise. I saw Sam’s nose wrinkle.

“Let’s check it out,” he said, but his voice didn’t sound curious anymore. It sounded cautious. Edged.

I hesitated. Everything in my gut said turn around. “I don’t know, man. Something feels off.”

“Come on, don’t be a wuss,” he said with a shaky laugh, trying to shrug it off like always. But even he didn’t sound convinced.

He stepped forward, and I followed, picking my way through dry brush and avoiding the low-hanging limbs. The smell was thicker the closer we got—meaty, pungent, unmistakably wrong. When we reached the mound, I saw it. A hand. Sticking out like a white root from beneath the pile, fingers curled slightly, skin pale and mottled. Human.

I stopped cold. “Sam,” I whispered, my voice nearly lost in the breeze. “That’s… that’s a person.”

He took a step back, his face going white. “Nah, nah, can’t be. It’s probably just… a dead roo or something, a weird angle.”

I didn’t reply. I couldn’t. I was already crouching, using a long stick to push aside some of the branches. More of the body came into view—jeans, a torn shirt soaked with old blood, skin gone waxy. And her eyes… open, glazed, staring through us. Her chest was still, her face twisted in pain. She couldn’t have been older than twenty-five.

I gagged, stumbled back, barely holding down the water I’d just drunk. Sam had gone completely still, his lips moving like he was trying to speak but couldn’t form the words.

“Oh God, Sam,” I managed. “She’s been murdered.”

His hands were shaking now. “What do we do? Alex, what the hell do we do?”

I had to force myself to think. To not lose it. “We leave. Now. We call the cops.”

The forest didn’t feel like the same place anymore. The light was still golden, but it felt cold. The silence was heavier. Every snapping twig sounded like something watching us, following. I stuffed the map back in my bag without folding it, and we half-walked, half-ran toward the car. Sam tripped over a root and swore, and I nearly dropped my compass, fumbling to get the keys out as we reached the clearing. I don’t think either of us even took off our packs—we just climbed into the car and tore down the gravel road, dust billowing behind us.

Berrima wasn’t far, but the drive felt endless. Every corner we turned, every tree that rushed past, felt like it might reveal something else—another body, a car pulled to the side, someone stepping out of the woods. When we finally pulled into the police station, we were sweating and wild-eyed, stumbling over each other to explain.

The officer at the desk blinked at us like he wasn’t sure we were real. “You found *what* in Belanglo?”

“A body,” I said again, trying not to break down. “A woman. We didn’t touch much. It’s covered, but it’s her. She’s… gone.”

He stood up, no more hesitation, grabbed a radio, and called it in. Within minutes, we were seated in a side office, going over the details again and again, pointing out the location on a larger map he brought out from a filing cabinet. “You’ll need to take us there,” he said. “Can you do that?”

We could. And we did. That return walk through the forest was the longest hike of my life. The smell found us before the body did, just like before. Only this time, the officers were with us. One of them, a woman with sharp eyes and a thick ponytail, knelt down and confirmed what we already knew.

“This is a crime scene. Stay back. Don’t touch anything else.”

They asked everything. When we’d arrived. What we’d seen. Who we’d talked to. If we’d noticed anyone else in the area. My mind was a blur, my nerves shot. I answered what I could. Sam barely spoke.

We were told to leave after they secured the area. We drove back to Sydney in silence, the weight of what we’d seen settling in like a thick fog. I kept seeing her eyes. That hand. The stillness. Sam looked straight ahead, jaw clenched tight. We didn’t even stop for food.

It wasn’t long before we heard her name: Joanne Walters. An English backpacker. A day later, they found Caroline Clarke nearby—another young woman. She’d been shot. Executed, almost. The news exploded with the story. And months after that, they caught the man responsible—**Ivan Milat**. Seven confirmed victims, all travelers. Killed in the same forest we’d spent hours navigating like it was some kind of game.

I never went back to orienteering after that. Gave away my compass, folded up my maps for the last time. The bush, once a place of challenge and freedom, now felt like a graveyard. Sam and I drifted apart—not in a dramatic way, just quietly. Like two people who couldn’t share the same air anymore without remembering what we’d seen. I tried talking about it a few times, but every time I did, I saw her face again. Those eyes.

Now, every forest I pass looks different. Not mysterious, not inviting—just dangerous. Every night, I double check the locks. Sometimes I wake up thinking I smell that sour, rotten scent again. But mostly, I just try to forget what we found that day. Try, and fail.



Because Belanglo showed me the worst kind of fear—the human kind. The kind that wears a face and walks upright and knows exactly what it’s doing. And it waits in the quiet places, the beautiful ones, where no one ever thinks to look.







""**The Night Evelyn Vanished**"":

It was October 24, 1953, a chilly Saturday night in La Crosse, Wisconsin. The air outside had the kind of bite that hinted at an early winter, and the wind rustled dry leaves along the sidewalk in whispering little bursts. My daughter, Evelyn, was fifteen—just fifteen—but she had an old soul. Thoughtful, kind, always eager to help. She had a bright mind and a brighter heart, the kind of girl teachers adored and neighbors trusted. That night, she was babysitting for the Rasmusens, a young couple who lived just a few blocks away. They had a new baby, barely a year old, and Evelyn loved kids. She had promised to call us at 8:30, just to check in, like she always did.

The clock on the mantle chimed half past eight. I glanced up, expecting the phone to ring any second. But it didn’t. At first, I brushed it off. Maybe the baby was fussy, or Evelyn had dozed off on the couch. But then 8:40 came. Then 8:45. I stood up, heart starting to thud. Something wasn’t right.

“Margaret,” I called to my wife, who was curled up in the armchair, her knitting needles clicking softly in the quiet room. “Evelyn hasn’t called. She’s never late.”

Margaret looked up, her eyes narrowing in concern. “Maybe she’s just busy. You know how babies can be.”

I nodded slowly, but something deep in my gut twisted. My fingers trembled as I picked up the phone and dialed the Rasmusens' number. It rang once. Twice. Then five times. Ten. No answer. I hung up, pulse pounding in my ears. “We’re going over there,” I said, grabbing my coat off the hook near the door. Margaret didn’t say a word. She just put down her knitting and followed me out, her face drawn tight with worry.

The streets were quiet as we drove, headlights cutting through the dense fog rolling in from the river. Streetlamps glowed hazy and yellow, casting long shadows across the sidewalk. Every second felt like an hour. I kept imagining Evelyn curled up on the sofa, asleep, unaware of our panic. I prayed that’s what we’d find.

The Rasmusens' house looked normal at first. Lights on in the living room. Curtains drawn. A soft glow spilling out onto the porch. But the moment I stepped out of the car, I felt it—an unnatural stillness. No sounds of laughter, no baby crying, no movement at all. I knocked hard on the front door.

“Evelyn? You there?” I called out. Nothing. The only sound was a faint jazz tune playing on the radio inside, crackly and distant. I knocked again, louder. The baby should’ve stirred. Someone should’ve answered. My hand tightened on the doorknob. Locked.

“Try the back,” Margaret whispered.

We hurried around the side of the house, our breath hanging in the cold air. The back door was locked, too. I banged my fist against it, calling Evelyn’s name. Still nothing. I looked at the living room window—one of the side panes was cracked open. Just a few inches. “I’m going in,” I said, pushing it up farther.

“Richard, be careful,” Margaret whispered, but I was already climbing through.

My feet hit the hardwood floor with a dull thud. The air inside was cold, unnaturally so, and something was wrong. The room was in disarray. A dining chair was tipped on its side. Evelyn’s books—her schoolbooks—were strewn across the floor like they’d been knocked off the coffee table. Her eyeglasses lay near the rug, bent at the frame, one lens cracked clean through. My stomach dropped.

“Evelyn?” I called, louder now, more frantic.

I turned toward the crib. The baby was there—thank God. Sound asleep, cheeks pink with warmth. But Evelyn was nowhere. Margaret climbed in behind me and gasped when she saw the mess.

“What happened here?” she asked, her voice trembling.

I didn’t answer. I was already moving toward the hallway. The kitchen was dark, the faucet dripping. The air was still. Then I saw it. A dark stain on the hardwood, just a small drop at first. Then another. Leading toward the basement door. My breath caught in my throat.

“Margaret, stay here,” I said, though I’m not sure she heard me.

I opened the basement door. A cold, musty draft drifted up from below. I descended slowly, my hand trailing along the wall. The light down there was dim, a single bare bulb swaying slightly from the ceiling. The air smelled of damp earth and motor oil. More blood. A trail, faint but clear, leading to the far corner of the basement near the window well. There, the screen had been slashed, the window glass shoved inward. Below it, a large smear of blood, and scattered around—shoe prints. A man’s boots. And Evelyn’s smaller footprints, partially smudged.

“Richard!” Margaret’s voice echoed from above. “There’s more blood out here!”

I bolted up the stairs, two at a time. Margaret was standing near the front rug, her hand shaking as she pointed. More blood. Tiny drops, a spatter, leading toward the front door. Panic gripped me in full. I grabbed the phone, my fingers numb as I dialed the operator.

Within minutes, police sirens wailed through the fog. Red and blue lights flashed across the quiet houses. Neighbors peeked through curtains. Detective Roy Johnson was the first to arrive—a tall man with a weary expression and a sharp eye. He took one look at the house and nodded grimly.

“Tell me everything,” he said, pulling out a small notebook.

I tried to stay calm as I spoke, but my voice kept breaking. “She was supposed to call us at 8:30. She’s never late. We came here, found the house locked. Room was a mess. Blood in the basement. Her glasses are broken. And she’s gone.”

Johnson listened, his eyes scanning every corner. Margaret was holding Evelyn’s scarf in her hands, the one she’d worn earlier that day. It was still warm from her neck.

“Any enemies? Anyone who’d want to hurt her?” Johnson asked.

“No,” Margaret choked out. “She’s a sweet girl. Everyone loves her.”

The police spread out. They checked every room, every drawer. They found two distinct sets of footprints in the basement. One matched Evelyn’s. The other—larger, heavier—was unfamiliar. Outside, they followed the blood trail through the yard. It led to the sidewalk, then abruptly stopped. Like someone had dragged her into a car. No tire tracks in the fog-damp grass, but neighbors were starting to talk.

Mrs. Carter, from across the street, said she saw a light-colored car circling the block earlier. “Around 7:30, I think,” she whispered. “Looked out of place.”

“Did you see who was in it?” I asked.

“Too dark. But I heard a scream. Just for a second. Thought it was kids playing.”

Another neighbor, Ed Hofer, claimed he saw a green two-toned Buick speeding away around 8:15. “Back wheels fish-tailed on the corner. Thought the driver was drunk. Swore I saw someone in the back seat… maybe a girl.”

My heart felt like it would rip open. I wanted to chase that car, even now, hours too late. The police combed the neighborhood, knocked on every door, took statements from every witness. They sent blood samples to the lab, dusted the basement for prints. But so far—no Evelyn.

Detective Johnson pulled me aside near dawn. “Mr. Hartley,” he said gently. “You need to prepare yourself. This doesn’t look good.”

“What are you saying?” I snapped, angry now. “She’s out there. You can still find her!”

“We’re doing everything we can,” he said. “But the scene… the blood, the signs of a struggle, the car sightings… it looks like an abduction.”

I wanted to collapse. But I couldn’t. Not while she was still out there. Not while there was still a chance.

The days that followed were a nightmare. Search parties combed the woods. Police patrolled highways. The local paper ran Evelyn’s photo every day. Volunteers handed out flyers. Someone thought they saw her in St. Paul. Another tip came from a diner off Highway 35. Nothing panned out.

A week later, a farmer found a torn piece of fabric near a fence along Highway 14. It was bloodstained. Later, they found undergarments in a ditch, and a pair of shoes—Evelyn’s shoes. The soles matched prints from the basement. Then, a month later, a denim jacket was found in the woods, near a drainage culvert. Blood on the collar. It was her type.

The evidence kept piling up, and every piece was another nail in the coffin of hope. But no body. No Evelyn.

Rumors began to spread. About a man named Edward Gein from Plainfield—a strange loner, a handyman with a dark past. After he was arrested in 1957 for unspeakable crimes, people started whispering. Maybe he had something to do with Evelyn’s disappearance. Maybe he was the monster we’d all feared.

But there was no proof. Only questions. Only silence.

We never stopped looking. Never stopped hoping. Every knock at the door, every late-night call, I prayed it was her. But it never was. Sometimes I still dream of that night—of her glasses on the rug, of the baby’s quiet breathing, of the blood on the basement floor.



Who took my daughter? Why? I still ask those questions. I whisper them into the dark when sleep won’t come. And after all these years, the silence is still the only answer I get.",1,1745980115.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

Here's the beginning context.  I (F) have been married to my husband for 20+ years. We have two kids.  He's in a job he can't wait to retire from.  I recently finished a doctorate and am trying to get licensed for my new profession. I work at least 40 hours a week (WFH), plus take care of groceries, laundry, most of the house cleaning, most of the picking up of a child from school, and studying for the licensing exam.  He works up to 40 hours a week plus works some varying hours a week in his side-hustle. He handles the taking to school in the morning.

The licensing exam has been kicking my ass. I am trying to keep focuses on it, but I am doing all this other stuff. I am trying so hard. Like, SO HARD. I'm loosing faith and focus and hope. I'm close to spiraling. Am I danger to myself or others - Absolutely not.  But depressed as hell and filled with anxiety?  Yes.

Situation:

My job has me working extra hours (yay OT?) but my husband is acting out.  He's mad that I can't drop everything to Google something or look something up when needs it.  Cause he's busy.  He's mad that I was annoyed yesterday after working over 10+hrs and studying that I tried to ask him about a dinner plan.  He was napping.  I sucked it up, was going to log out of work earlier than planned to handle dinner, but he lost his shit ""I'LL GET DINNER!""  I say I was going to do it. I try to say I was just asking him what he wanted.  Nothing.  Whatever, fine. Handle dinner.  It was at this point, I started getting the silent treatment.    Fine, so I SEND HIM A MESSAGE since he won't talk to me and is 4 feet away - I apologize if I snapped. I explain I'm tired. Very tired.  I am doing my best.  Give me a little grace if I can't keep handling it all.  Silence.

Today.

Today the silent treatment continues til dinner (which I thought I avoided by throwing something in the crockpot). Even made him a coffee this morning when I made mine, he ignored it and didn't touch it.

When I try talk to him, he tells me he's pissed about what I said to him and that clearly he's not allowed to nap. (never said that)  He's mad that I told him he's worthless and that everything is his fault (never said that).  He tells me I'm being childish because I tried to take his plate after dinner, and without saying a word to me, pulled it away from me.   So I go out, put dinner away, start cleaning up the kitchen.  He finally comes out and gets pissed he wanted more dinner.  So I say, you could have told me you wanted more instead of silently pulling your plate away from me.

He tells me he doesn't want to talk to me cause he's offended at what I said yesterday.  He tells me that I'M in the wrong for how I talked to him.  So I ask him, but giving me the silent treatment is mature?   Admittedly, I'm at my wit's end.  I usually choose my words carefully,  but at this point, I am just really mad and hurt.

Mentally/emotionally killed myself to get this degree to help my family.

Mentally/emotionally killing myself to get licensed.

I'm sorry that I'm not licensed yet so you can retire from the job you hate.

I'm sorry that I don't have enough hours in a day to do all the things I need to do, including studying for the licensing exam.

I don't need to feel any more ""LESS THAN"" than I already do.  Am I the asshole, too?

Ask me questions. Take me to task. Help me figure this out.  PLEASE, Reddit, I'm asking.

In the past, several years ago, I did go into therapy. He would not.

I'm not looking for a cure for who I'm married to, but I need to know that I'm not going crazy.  Have I thought of leaving before? Sure.  Can I without being licensed? No. Am I thankful one of my kids is an adult? yes.  What's the question?  Am I the asshole? I am at a point and time where I do not have support.. So what do I need?  Support I guess?

I'm just... feeling so lost and I cannot do enough about it right now, so I guess that makes you my therapy session?  At this rate? I don't know.. But the tears are hot, the hole in my heart grows larger, and the ability to do much of anything is not available at the moment.",2,1745980008.0,AITAH,4,0.76,False

I don’t want it to dispense 0 TDS water and have to remineralize it manually with something like TWW, both because I want to be lazy and also because it will be for the whole family and I want the drinking water straight from the system to be tasty without additional inconvenient steps. 

Does anyone have a recommendation for an under sink RO system that fits the bill? It would have to automatically produce remineralized water for coffee on par with or at least close to the kind of water you can make by hand.",1,1745980005.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

I don't mind keeping some of the scratches in it cause it reminds me of its history but I do want to protect it from further damage and make it a little easier to clean without fear of discoloring the bare bits further.

We (29f, 29m) have a 5 year old and 9 month old. He works I stay home, which is a recent thing since having our second child. I used to work part time, but staying home with the kids was something we both really wanted and value. But it feels like now he resents me for this and doesn’t understand how hard I work 24/7. Im still up with baby several times a night. He hasn’t even changed a diaper in months. 

Which wouldn’t bother me, except he’s constantly on me to get more done throughout the day and doesn’t ever appreciate all that I do. I am overworked and overwhelmed as is, I keep the house very tidy, I make 3 meals a day, I do all the laundry, all the shopping, all the appointments, all the childcare etc. etc.

And what are his first words to me every morning?  “Get this room cleaned up” “vacuum the house” or “make the bed” or some other cleaning demand if not demanding a cup of coffee. 

I feel like an unappreciated slave. He spends most of his free time smoking and avoiding us. I feel like I’m living with a stranger and I resent him for not being present and being so mean to me, especially in front of our kids. He doesn’t speak kindly, it’s all sarcastic or cruel. It’s like he can’t even be a real honest person. 

I really don’t want to get divorced. And I believe that there’s still that person I fell in love with somewhere in there, but I feel hopeless and in despair right now. ",0,1745979566.0,relationship_advice,32,0.5,False

Until now we text consistently, occasionally talking about our dating situation, and what she's looking for in a guy (sometimes I feel like she's describing me).

Me? The truth? Your own guilt?
Because you didn’t just leave — you bolted.

One day you were holding me, watching stand-up comedy in bed like we were okay.
The next morning, you dropped a casual, cold “what I said yesterday still stands” before heading to the shower like you were announcing the weather.
No discussion. No softness. No humanity. Just… done.

I still replay it.
Still sit with the questions you never bothered to answer.

What was so wrong with me?
What made me disposable?
Why did I feel like a disease you needed to shake off?

You have a heart. I know you do. That’s the whole damn reason I fell in love with you.
So how did you shut it off so easily?
How did you not even flinch?

Was I too much? Too broken? Too inconvenient for the image you were trying to maintain?
You didn’t have to choose me. But you could’ve chosen kindness.
You could’ve chosen closure.
You chose silence.

Do you avoid the places we used to go, too?
The ones that weren’t firsts for you — but were everything for me?
Like the cozy little coffee shop on Buffalo’s West Side — Five Points Bakery — where I’d sit across from you trying to memorize your face between sips.
Or those birria tacos at Taqueria Ranchos Dos on Delaware — the ones you introduced me to, the ones that became our ritual, our thing, even if you’d eaten them a hundred times before.

Do you stay away for the same reason I do — because being there would feel like standing in a memory that hasn’t faded yet?

Or is it something else?

Do you avoid those places because you’re afraid I’ll be there?
Because seeing me — the person you left behind — might make you feel something?
Might make you uncomfortable?
Because god forbid, you’d have to look me in the eyes and remember that I was real.

What are you running from, boy?
Because it sure as hell wasn’t me.

My hobbies include swimming, bowling, rock climbing, traveling, but my favorite hobby is chatting over a tea or coffee in a cafe or restaurant. I don’t drink or smoke. 
I am a blind person and I decided early in life that it wasn’t going to stop me from achieving what I wanted to achieve. I’m also very outgoing. I also produce my own music and have been doing so for the last 3 years. 

I am also interested in a wide variety of subjects including meteorology, sociology, psychology and language learning. I have spent a lot of time in the US, including states such as New York, New Jersey, the Carolinas, Georgia , Florida, Nevada and Arizona. If you’re from Europe it would probably be better to chat because the time zone differences woudln’t be so great.
