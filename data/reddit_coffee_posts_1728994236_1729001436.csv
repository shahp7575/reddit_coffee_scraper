1g48k9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1g48k9m/a_letter_to_my_exbpd/,A letter to my exBPD,"I'll never contact my ex with BPD again, but for the past year, there has been a lot I wanted to get off my chest. Here is what I would say to him, if I could (sorry for the long post, I just need to vent)

""First of all, fuck you. You are one of the worst people I have ever met. You thought you were so sneaky, but it was so easy to see through all of your lies. You lied about being sober, but as soon as I was gone for the weekend, you got extremely drunk, sliced your hand open and left blood dripping all over the house and didn't clean it up, and tried to hide your empty beer bottles. You did this countless times. You even started to do hard drugs near the end. 

You called out of work constantly, making lame excuses like that your hemorrhoids were bothering you. Grow the fuck up, you're a 39-year-old man and sometimes you have to go to work even if you're in a little bit of discomfort. You lied to me and pretended that you had such bad tooth pain that you couldn't go to work, and you put me in a position where I had no choice but to pay for an emergency extraction of your tooth. You promised you would pay me back, but obviously you did not, and I lost $700 just so you could get out of going to work one day. Of course you lost that job because you were an irresponsible loser. When you lost your next job because you screamed at your bosses and threatened violence against them, you promised that if you didn't find any job prospects, you would apply at the grocery store or gas station as a stop gap. When I brought that up about a month into your unemployment, you said that that would be ""too hard on your mental health"". You stayed unemployed for three months, relying on me to pay all of the bills in our house, and provide you with groceries every week. You even expected me to cook for you. As soon as you got a new job, which I helped you apply for, and let you use my work computer in order to complete your online trainings, you broke up with me and discarded me about a week after. You thought you were so slick. But it's so obvious that you were just using me for three months when you had no money and waiting for your new job to start so that you could discard me and move on with your life. you expected me to give you rides everywhere but you would refuse to get your license or even practice driving. 

Once during a fight, you held me down using your 6'7, 300 pound frame, wrapping your limbs around me so I could not move. When I struggled to get free, you held me even tighter so that I could not move. After screaming for you to let me go for two minutes, you finally did. When I confronted you and asked why you would do that to me, you said it was because I was being abusive by flailing around and trying to get out of your grip. You gaslight me into thinking that I was the abusive one. And you are such an expert at lying and manipulating people, that I actually believed you. It's so easy to see now that you were the abusive one.

You yelled at me because I expressed that I was struggling to pay for everything for two people, and you said that because I bought a iced coffee for myself on Saturday and Sunday mornings, that I was being irresponsible. It was my money you fucking asshole, if I wanted to spend five dollars to get a coffee that made me happy, I should be able to do that without you interfering. When we broke up, you claimed that some nights you went to bed hungry because I didn't cook for you or because there wasn't enough food in the house. Fuck you. There was always rice, beans, and frozen chicken. I was struggling to keep the light bill on, and you had the audacity to complain that you were hungry. Get a job and buy your own fucking food. You were just a lazy sack of shit who didn't want to cook your own food so you blamed it on me. You spent the last month of our relationship hanging out with a woman that you claimed you were not interested in. It was no surprise to learn that you were actively cheating on me the last month of our relationship with a person that you constantly reassured me I didn't have to be worried about. 

I was heartbroken when you broke up with me. But now I realize it's one of the best things that ever happened to me. You refused to move out of my house for three months after the break up, claiming that you couldn't find anywhere to live. You continued to call out of work constantly, and you are an embarrassment of a human. Once you finally left, you left behind so many of your possessions for me to take care of. I had to seek legal counsel to determine how to get rid of of your items without putting myself in legal jeopardy for throwing away your property. You took advantage of my family, manipulating them into buying you birthday gifts and Christmas presents, with my mother spending a lot of money on you because she wanted to make my partner felt included in the family. Once you got everything you wanted, you abandoned me. 

A few weeks after the break up, you predictably reached out to me and tried to use me for emotional support and validation. You claimed that you were so hurt and crying and lonely, and it made me so happy to hear that you were suffering like you caused me to suffer. I hope nothing good ever comes to you and your life. Until you seek therapy and actually engage meaningfully, your life will continue to be filled with disappointment and suffering, and I am happy for it.

I wish you the worst of luck. But most of all, I wish that you would stay away from other people so you don't hurt and abuse them like you did to me.""",1,1729001257.0,BPDlovedones,0,1.0,False

I'll charge only Php399 for basic mock interview session (parang nilibre mo nako ng kape + pastries sa coffee shop lol) What you can expect:
-30-minutes mock interview session with me as your interviewer and questions curated to your need (our conversation would be like the usual run of how recruiters go through and screen your profile and non negotiables of some hiring managers in the role that you're applying for.

The landlady had become so accustomed to my late habits that my place had not been laid nor my coffee prepared. With the unreasonable petulance of mankind I rang the bell and gave a curt intimation that I was ready. Then I picked up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the articles had a pencil mark at the heading, and I naturally began to run my eye through it.*

*Its somewhat ambitious title was “The Book of Life,” and it attempted to show how much an observant man might learn by an accurate and systematic examination of all that came in his way. It struck me as being a remarkable mixture of shrewdness and of absurdity. The reasoning was close and intense, but the deductions appeared to me to be far-fetched and exaggerated. The writer claimed by a momentary expression, a twitch of a muscle or a glance of an eye, to fathom a man’s inmost thoughts. Deceit, according to him, was an impossibility in the case of one trained to observation and analysis. His conclusions were as infallible as so many propositions of Euclid. So startling would his results appear to the uninitiated that until they learned the processes by which he had arrived at them they might well consider him as a necromancer.*

*“From a drop of water,” said the writer, “a logician could infer the possibility of an Atlantic or a Niagara without having seen or heard of one or the other. So all life is a great chain, the nature of which is known whenever we are shown a single link of it. Like all other arts, the Science of Deduction and Analysis is one which can only be acquired by long and patient study, nor is life long enough to allow any mortal to attain the highest possible perfection in it. Before turning to those moral and mental aspects of the matter which present the greatest difficulties, let the enquirer begin by mastering more elementary problems. Let him, on meeting a fellow-mortal, learn at a glance to distinguish the history of the man, and the trade or profession to which he belongs. Puerile as such an exercise may seem, it sharpens the faculties of observation, and teaches one where to look and what to look for. By a man’s finger nails, by his coat-sleeve, by his boot, by his trouser knees, by the callosities of his forefinger and thumb, by his expression, by his shirt cuffs—by each of these things a man’s calling is plainly revealed. That all united should fail to enlighten the competent enquirer in any case is almost inconceivable.”*

*“What ineffable twaddle!” I cried, slapping the magazine down on the table, “I never read such rubbish in my life.”*

*-*A Study in Scarlet by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle

Everything is right about the above, except for one or two things.

1. Humans don’t deal with objective things like 223 types of tobacco ash or anything of that sort. Humans deal with subjective things; like emotions, people, the balance between order and chaos as we read in ’12 Rules for Life’ by Jordan Peterson etc.
2. We cannot make snap judgements about these infinite things. 223 types of tobacco ash might be very easy to memorise in a year. But when you are dealing with an infinite about of things, this becomes impossible. So to make deductions is therefore to follow the train of thoughts about each of the infinite things that come your way. It is very hard to do it, unless your hobby is thinking. (Proof: ‘The basic premise of the TV series Sherlock is to respect the trans community.’ *I reached this conclusion because my hobby is thinking.*)

tl;dr: The Science of Deduction can only be followed if your hobby is thinking.",1,1729001105.0,SherlockHolmes,0,1.0,False

First time wasn't bad, mild cold symptoms but lost my smell and taste for 18 months. Next few times were like a mild flu. 

Started off with insane acid reflux on Thursday and Friday, called out of work Friday for it. Horrific heartburn and stomach pain. 

Subsided a bit Saturday, went back to work. Had some sore throat pain, but I also found a massive tonsil stone, and chalked it up to that. 

Sunday, sore throat still present, removed the tonsil stone, felt mostly okay, but perhaps a bit tired. Slight loss of appetite. 

Monday morning, wake up at 4 AM with a horrific sore throat and headache. Was able to go back to sleep until around 8 AM. Have coffee, immediately feel the urge to throw up. Did not vomit, but by 10 AM, I had fully body soreness, aches, chills, headache, sore throat, insane nausea and diarrhea, stuffy nose and sinus congestion, and slightly dry cough. No fever, vomiting, shortness of breath or loss of smell yet. Have intermittent lung/chest/rib pains. Tested positive by 11 AM Monday, the line instantly showed up on a Binax test. By evening the DayQuil had helped but the nausea and diarrhea were so severe that I couldn't even roll over in bed without heaving. 

Now moving into Tuesday morning and the symptoms seem about the same, don't have any medication in me yet, but they seem a little less debilitating today.

My SIL’s birthday is coming up. We have gotten gift cards to death, and we’ll do that if we have to, but I would love to get something a bit more personal that she’d actually like. I can’t ask her (the answer is always “I don’t need anything”) and my MIL never helps with ideas.

She doesn’t have any hobbies that you can buy stuff for - doesn’t craft, do outside activities, or anything like that. She doesn’t go out to eat or travel much but I’m trying to convince her to travel more. She doesn’t drink alcohol or coffee. She lives in a state where recreational weed is legal - she does smoke, but I don’t think it’s legal to get a gift card to a dispensary 😂. I don’t partake so don’t know anything about cannabis plus we’re flying in from a different state so I can’t buy anything here. 

She works two jobs, and enjoys shopping mostly for shoes and clothes. She loves animals but doesn’t have any pets. She isn’t a huge makeup person. She doesn’t cook. She watches a lot of tv but I think shares most logins with her parents. She likes astrological sign stuff. 

I am at a complete loss what to do. My MIL suggested bringing her to a dispensary and paying. But if we even did that, I would want something physical to give her too.

When we’ve gotten gift cards in the past we’ve done Target, Sephora, Bath and Body Works, Victoria’s Secret, and Nothing Bundt cakes. She does not shop on Amazon, and trying to stay away from those visa gift cards. 

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated! We don’t see her a lot for her birthday so it’s nice we can celebrate in person this year.

1. Sounds like textbook anxiety, feelings of doom, etc.
2. Physiological feeling of having drunk 3 cups of coffee when you haven’t had any, buzzing under skin, heart racing, etc.  Sometimes waking up with this in middle of night, but sometimes during day.

I am interested in understanding the second of these more.  I think if it happens, since it is a panicky kind of feeling, it can make one react more nervously to things and get anxious easily, but I don’t think anxiety is the root cause.  I think it’s a physiological thing.  But WHAT physiological thing, and how to address it if you don’t take hormones?  (I’m 57 and had last period 6 years ago and have higher breast cancer risk so haven’t wanted to do that, but maybe I should?)

Specifically my dr is worried about high blood pressure.  I do think one’s BP goes up when this feeling happens, but in my case it does seem to then go down again.  So should it be treated with BP meds?  I know some here take beta blockers, but I would rather not do that unless it were really necessary.

This is a story about the problems I am having in my current relationship of me 21M and my girlfriend 21F. I feel it only right to be brutally honest, and leave everything on the table. I need to do this as a form of self reflection as well as to put everything on the table if I decide to share this with someone. I write this not to put anyone down or defame anyone, just to share my story and receive advice on what to do next. To start things off, the backstory. 

Me and my current girlfriend have been together for three and a half years and for the entirety of our relationship I have been physically and sexually neglected. We started dating during covid in a time where we were unable to see each other. Firstly because of restrictions, we couldn’t leave home and didn’t want to be staying together as we had not revealed our relationship to our families. Secondly, unbeknownst to me at the time, her family was extremely protective and old style. 

At this point in the relationship I had struggles with holding a relationship as I didn’t understand the sacrifice necessary and to be honest was a walking redflag. Through the first 6 months of the relationship I spent a lot of time making mistakes, apologising, and changing to be a better partner, and I still make changes to this day. It was about this time that restrictions were lifted and we were able to see each other. And when I say “see each other” I'm referring only to school. Her parents were strict and would not allow her to hang out on weekends or after school. This meant the only opportunity we had together was before school and during breaks. Every morning I would leave 30 minutes early to see her at McDonalds for coffee and to walk to school together. She was having dramas with school friends so I integrated her into my friend group and we would sit together at snack and lunch. Coming up to approx 8 months into our relationship (while I had definitely improved) I still had some issues, specifically a female friend that was very attached to me. I’ve been told she was into me and trying to get in the way of our relationship but was oblivious at the time and thought she was a mate. This caused a breakup in our relationship which lasted a few days and I did the typical F-boy thing of adding as many girls as possible and conveniently having my phone in a position where she could see all the girls texting me. This left her upset enough to confront me over text, which opened the conversation. After a bit of talking I decided it was time for a necessary change, I stopped talking to the girl, removed all the girls off my snapchat, and committed fully to the relationship. 

From here covid struck again, we went back into lock down about 9 months into our relationship and we still hadn’t kissed or done anything. At this stage I hadn’t thought too much of it and mainly put myself to blame for an inability to make a move. We continued to talk online, playing video games and talking on discord. Through this period I was constantly asking to meet up and go on a walk or just to see each other. I was going above and beyond waving to her outside her window and delivering gifts. Although out of fear for what her family would say, she still didn’t come out to see me. This is where our first argument (where I was mad at her) happened. After begging and begging I was told she’s not allowed out of the house and to stop asking, a week later her best friend (who she was arguing with a lot at the time) posted a photo of them together at the park going for a walk together. I felt like I had been lied to and betrayed but eventually got over it. My main issue at the time was I felt like she was embarrassed to be seen with me but little did I know it was the start of an ongoing issue for her to step out of her comfort zone or make any sacrifice for me. It took about another month or two for covid restrictions to clear and she was able to take her dog for a walk to come hang out with me. She didn’t tell her family she was with me but I was just happy to finally get some time alone with her. I didn't realise she was hiding me from her family. It was at this time that we were able to have our first kiss about 10 or 11 months into our relationship, this started a trend of going on dog walks, driving her to my house to makeout for a little bit and then leaving. This happened about 4 or 5 times across 2 months before the lockdown ended and we were back at school. Coming into 1 year of dating, I was pushing for her to tell her family about me. I kept asking and asking and over time she started to agree it was the next step in our relationship. At this stage I hadn’t met her family, we hadn’t done anything sexual online or in person. Eventually she told her family and was terrified of what they would think of me, say to me, and how they would treat the situation. To be blunt…. There were no issues, we all got along great and still do to this day. At this stage hangouts consisted of going out and doing activities or watching movies or tv in the living room. I was concerned with the lack of alone time but told her that I was willing to be patient and take things slow as it was her first relationship and I was also her first kiss. Across the next year absolutely nothing changed. From our 1 year anniversary until our second year anniversary, our sexual experience went from nothing, to her sending photos in a bra and making out for short periods about once a month. I spent lots of time trying to stay positive whilst also hinting at the idea of taking things further. She spent lots of time saying how she was afraid of trying new things. Upon talking about it more and lots of questions it became clear she was unable to step out of her comfort zone. She didn’t want to have the tough conversation with strict parents, she didn’t want to send photos she had never sent, she didn’t want to try new things when alone with me and it took a dig at my confidence. I felt like she was not attracted to me and through this time she had no sex drive. Across a whole year she never once got horny with me or in general and made me doubt myself as a man, and I no longer feel like I can be seen as attractive. Over time it did improve but at a slow rate. Going through year 2 to 3 of our relationship, things progressed slightly and across this time I would receive the occasional hand job and was able to see her naked. To clarify the specifics of a handjob… This would consist of her jerking me off for about 2 minutes while she looked at the TV, she would then say her hand was tired, ask me to take over until I finished whilst she would kiss me. It never really felt like she was into it, and more just felt like she was doing it because she felt she had to, and just wanted to get it over and done with. While at first I was thrilled with the progress, over time things only got worse. While she was doing it for me it became clear she was only doing it to stay in the relationship. It became a typical routine of her only jerking me off because it was what I wanted and there was never any reciprocal sex drive. At this time my sexual confidence only declined… Only ever seeming like a chore and only happening when there was nothing better to do. My other issue at this stage was that we were still unable to sleep alone together. She feared asking her family if we could sleep over together, and this was a growing frustration for me. Coming into Easter about 2 and a half years into our relationship my family booked a hotel house to stay at. This was the first time we were able to sleep in a bed together (she told her family we were staying in different rooms) and I was full of hope for something great. Not only did nothing sexual happen, we didn’t even make out. I was very upset and voiced my opinions but the only explanations were that she was scared to try new things and was too tired from the long days exploring the town with family.

Through this period of year 2-3 she only got horny a few times. Across this 1 year period we dry humped 4 times. Every Time this happened it would give me false hope that we were turning a corner but things would then go dry for months and leave me feeling neglected again. This in itself shouldn’t be seen as anything special and I'm confused as to why I feel like this was a step in the right direction. Across this year I would voice my opinion about once a month and confess my concerns and how I had lost all sexual confidence and felt completely neglected. Everytime we had this conversation I would urge her to step out of her comfort zone for the sake of our relationship and she would apologise and say she would do better just for nothing to change. Another issue coming at this time that I continue to voice that still lives up to this day is the excuses I hear. For the entirety of our relationship any sexual experience usually doesn't happen as I am turned down for one of the following excuses. She feels sick, She feels tired, or there is not enough time. These excuses make up about 95% of all times we are alone. This only adds to the neglect I feel as I am never prioritised and all issues I have aren't being addressed. 

It was at this stage that I started losing motivation. I felt like it was unfair that I had made so many changes and compromises over the years and put in all the effort, but the only issue I have ever had, she refused to make any changes for me or our relationship.

 After a year of neglect and having the monthly conversation I was just about ready to throw in the towel. At this point our families loved each other, our relationship was strong (excluding the sexual stuff) and we were going for a new years holiday with my family. It was at this stage I voiced to her that I needed things to change and that I needed to have sex on our holiday as we would have plenty of time alone.

I gave the ultimatum that if we didn’t have sex on our 9 day holiday, I would be ending the relationship. I understood it was a big step but believed if she loved me she would be willing to make the sacrifice and do what needed to be done to keep our relationship afloat. Despite everything and the romantic setting, nothing happened. Again we finally were alone 8 nights in a row and had an amazing view and plenty of time alone to be intimate and yet nothing happened. No sexual nature, no flirting, not even a handjob as a chore. I was furious, I was heartbroken, and I felt betrayed. 

I felt guilty that I was putting the pressure on her and felt even worse as I felt I was forcing things onto her. Through this time I never forced myself onto her and thought I must have been to blame for the issues and was convinced that it was my fault that nothing was working. Despite what I said, I didn’t keep my word. I stayed in the relationship and thought she just needed some more time. Coming onto the present (10 months later) and over 3 and a half years together, I feel completely neglected and unmotivated. There has been slight progress, I’ve received 4 blowjobs (each lasting 30 seconds before her jaw got tired). But in reality I’m stuck at a point where I feel like I'm wasting my time.

It's important to note at this point that there has never been any sex drive from her. No flirting, no hinting at anything sexual, no teasing, or anything to ever turn me on or do anything cheeky. 

I feel ashamed to write this and embarrassed that I’ve accepted this as a standard in my relationship but am lost at what to do next.

I’ve voiced that I feel neglected, she has zero sex drive, she never tries to do anything to make me feel satisfied, and I’ve lost all confidence in myself. 

Despite this, every other part of our relationship is perfect…. Our families get along great, we share the same values (children, religion, dating standards etc). Our friendship groups are very intertwined and we also work together in my family business. There are lots of things that would be extremely difficult if we split but I don't want to be in a relationship where I'm neglected due to a partner with literally zero sex drive.

TLDR…At present, We have been together over 3 and a half years, have never had sex, have only given each other head a handful of times for small durations, we still cannot have sleepovers, she fears having sex or trying anything new, I’ve lost all motivation to go above and beyond and do anything special for her when I feel she can’t do the bare minimum for me, and now I feel like i'm going crazy. 

I beg her about once a month to step out of her comfort zone for me!

I need advice on what to do next…. Am I pushing too hard, am I an asshole forcing her to do things she isn't ready for? I really care about her but for a guy with a decently strong sex drive I cant maintain this. I’d hate to take her virginity just to get laid once every three months (the current average time between her doing anything) and we have to break up. I can't endure the neglect any longer.

I’ve never cheated, never watched porn, never looked at another girl in any kind of way, and I’ve always tried to do everything I can, spending all my time and money doing everything for this girl I care so much about but I feel like i'm talking to a brick wall who is refusing to change.

We went to the same college and then uni and met each other through mutual friends. She was a friend for a while and that’s all I saw her as and then I don’t know I just loved her. It had been coming on so gradually I didn’t catch it. And when I did I swore I wouldn’t tell her, I couldn’t do it to our friendship.

Lasted a year and then fessed up and we ended up going out because she felt the same. We dated for 2 years. A good fucking 2 years. It was the kind of love that the people in those stupid movies had. I was obsessed with her, she was all I wanted. But we couldn’t communicate. It had been a tiny issue in our friendship that had been magnified when we got together. 

When she was pissed, upset she wanted to be left alone. Not in the way where people say they want to be alone and don’t mean it - she actually wanted to be alone. She’s a very independent woman. And when I’m mad? I need to talk. We have to have it out. And she just wouldn’t. I’d take screaming matches and broken plates over silence, over nothing. So I’d make the situation worse, ramp it up so that she would be forced to have it out with me. It was making her miserable and it was making me miserable. I tried to be like her and give her the space she’d need but I was just fucking sick the whole time. I couldn’t concentrate. And I realised that I needed her in a way she didn’t need me. It wasn’t healthy, I had put her on a pedestal she couldn’t meet. 

She got a job offer fresh out of graduation in New York (an english writing thing) (we’re from London) and we both knew we wouldn’t survive long distance. 

We broke up, mutually, It was rough. I went right up to the airport with her. It kinda felt like my heart was walking outside of my body. We knew if we were done we had to be DONE. She blocked me and I blocked her. After six months (of really trying to get myself together) I started dating again. I had girlfriends, I went to law school (in my last year, i’m 24 - 25 in a month) and I never heard about her again. Until two years later, it was really weird I just bumped into her when I was on a walk around Hyde Park. 

God, people, she’s so beautiful. Even after all the years she’s fucking stunning. She dyed her hair back to brown (natural colour) she was dressed different and…god I just wanted to know her. 

She chatted to me, we were both free so we figured we’d grab coffee at a coffee shop. She’s always cold, she kept her gloves and coat on. We talked for two hours. I went into the talk interested in friendship and walked away from it in love with her. 

We talked about even thing. Work, her time in America, our friends, our families, old jokes, what we wanted from the world. It was like nothing had passed but it had. She was different, her views had changed and what she wanted for herself had changed but she was still Megan. I still loved her. 

She took her gloves off at the end and the ring on her finger…fuck. I asked her about it, couldn’t not. She told me she met someone in America, nine months in. They’d been together a year before he proposed. A year? She’d always sworn she needed to be with someone for two minimum. 

I asked her about him she said, “He’s nice and he listens to me, he makes me happy.” He’s nice? Chocolate is nice? A dog is nice you just described the qualities of a dog. 

We parted ways, I unblocked her and she unblocked me. We still have many mutual friends so once we let them know we were bag on good terms everyone started getting along much better and her and I hung out. 

This started in May - it’s October. I am in love with her. I’ve tried to stop, I’ve tried to get with other women. Sure it works and I care for them far too little than seems appropriate. I just want her. 

I’ve met her fiancé ‘Mark’ maybe I’m fucking biased but jesus fuck. You know how I’ll describe him? Roy from the office. 

He’s far too arrogant for what he has to offer, how he behaves around Megan and how he behaves when she’s not around is shocking. Yes with her he’s nice, does listen to her. When she’s not around he’s loud, short, cocky, selfish, self centred. And all our friends agree but she just won’t see it. I don’t know what she sees in him. 

On October 1st her and I went to a friends house party together (house warming?) she got tipsy and I was the DD. I was driving her home and parked in front of her house. Here’s the following conversation. Damn right I memorised it.

“We’re here, I’ll walk you to the door.” “I hate having an empty house.” “Where’s ’Mark’ tonight?” “Watching the football at the pub.” “Ah, it’s late he should be back.” “Doubt it.” “….” “Would you like to come in?” “I’ll walk you to the door.” “And then?” “And then I’m walking back to my car.” “Ever the saint Julian.” “Mm.” “I wish you weren’t sometimes, I wish you were the type of man who…” “Who what?” “Says the things no one else wants to.” “I usually do no?” “Then why won’t you say it here.” “Say what?” “I don’t know.” “Why aren’t you the type of woman who says what she wants?” “Because I’m scared of what I want.” “What do you want?” “That’s the question.” “And I can’t answer it for you.” “I know.” “I’ll walk you to the door.” “Okay.” 

And I did and she goes “If you had just asked me to, I would have.” “Asked you to do what?” “Leave.” “Leave what?” “….” “You’re drunk.” “Yes.” “Good night.” “Night.” 

And then I had to get a damn plane for a wedding and a funeral both in Italy and I was gone for two weeks. And I came back, October 12th and realised she’s getting married on the fifteenth. I’ve tired to contact her with no avail. Her friends say she’s already at the cabin where she’s getting married and there’s no fucking service like my life isn’t hard enough. So now what? I let that go? I get her go? I can’t. I fucking can’t. and I don’t think she wants me to. Isn’t that what she meant? That if I asked she’d leave him. She deserves better and I don’t know if I’m the better but I’ll try. I’m older, more mature than I was so is she. 

If I leave tonight I’ll make it for the morning of her wedding. I have no other way to reach her. I don’t even know what I’d say. But I can’t let her marry him without telling her I love her. Even if I lose her all over again. Better that. 

So I think I’m going to do it, I have to right?

(I would get a job that makes more but this is 5 mins from my house and he said i dont really need to work so i just do it to get out of the house) But for example, he will pay for a date that HE offered to go on and complain about his finances later and make me feel bad and ask me to pay him back for some of it. He will buy me a $5 coffee and make me pay him back for that. It’s embarrassing because we will be out in public  and he will be panicking while paying for something and i always have to be like “its okay ill pay for it instead” and other girls in relationships look at me funny. He complains when he spends any amount of money on me when i dont even ask. I try to pay for all of my stuff because i dont want to hear about it later. And btw hes not hurting on money. He comes from a very rich family and they send him money for no reason, plus our bills are only $500 a month and we split that. Ive tried to talk to him about it and he says im calling him stingy but those words never come out of my mouth. I just ask why he stresses so much about money when we aren’t really struggling.

As promised during yesterday's post, I've begun my research into a forecast on our price movement over the course of our next options cycle and accordingly shifted some of my gaze into larger perspectives. Whereas in prior weeks and months, I've talked about the end of our technical paradigm concluding sometime at the end of October or beginning of November, I've come to suspect that the paradigm will be transforming in a different way than I previously projected - and that it is actually ending as of this week. Today's discussion is going to involve a little more TA than usual, but I think it's important to draw our attention to these patterns as we try to piece together what we can expect in the possible coming of a 2021 requel. We'll start small Let's take a look. 

**Price Movement Recap**

Yesterday's trading day started off with a fake-out dip on some light volume likely in acknowledgement and expectation of our continued recovery trend into 10/18 OPEX. Bearish trades shot the price down just below $20.50 - last week's floor - and allowed bearish traders the opportunity to cash out on long puts and short calls while setting up to take advantage of yesterday's recovery action. 

[10\/14 Trading Day 1-min Aggegation](https://preview.redd.it/m7rk9f95lwud1.png?width=1582&format=png&auto=webp&s=8803c14baf1099f025897c78cc7e536084048ec4)

At around 10:45am EDT the price slowly started to walk up towards the VWAP +1 Standard Deviation line. Right as it reached this territory, some volume suddenly picked up and shot the price up before bearish traders attempted to take advantage of a big RSI overbought signal - but this was a trap.

In the span of a half hour, 1.2 million shares of bullish volume poured in and shot the stock price up all the way $21.67 - $0.02 shy of our 50-day SMA and the technical upper bound on our week to week trading channel. The stock price reversed back to VWAP where traders picked up a small oversold signal to return the stock price to the 200-min moving average where things looked to rest into the end of the day before some large bullish options orders took us on another small run up to $21.50, before settling into the close.

**OI Changes + Max Pain**

Although Max Pain is still at $20, we saw a huge expansion of Call OI and contraction of Put OI and short Call OI heading into October OPEX (necessarily Bullish):

[10\/18 OPEX OI Changes 10\/14-10\/15](https://preview.redd.it/wbtylsux6xud1.png?width=1867&format=png&auto=webp&s=de9cafd2ca70e5a00b42a332a36323094a9337cd)

Plenty of this Call Volume was bearish. However, net flows were bullish on the day and, crucially, $21.50 has filled in with a large volume of Calls at the ASK. With $21 and $22 as substantial levels of OI, this is shaped to enable potential gamma runs across that range and up to $22 throughout week.

**Gamma Exposure**

https://preview.redd.it/tu41dqgr7xud1.png?width=519&format=png&auto=webp&s=02b8fac5034a45e98b6dfbeee9e6deddcb179919

Put GEX has evaporated below $20 and Call Gamma forms a thick, stable range up even through $23 ($22.50 is a little light on OI, but this could change). If options flows stay bullish and consistent, stock price recovery can easily grind its way up throughout the week or be set up for something upward and dynamic late week depending on price positioning ahead of this. Major downside volatility risk is minimal at this point.

**Technicals**

Okay, everyone, we've been looking at the daily chart since mid-July for three full months now here at Open Interest - the whole of Q3. We've also been looking at my doodle projection for exactly one month and it has indeed played out (with some infelicities) according to my projection back before September OPEX. Throughout this Q3 timeframe, we've seen a technical paradigm establish itself and largely find respect and valuation amid traders and institutions over that timeframe. How do I know that? If they didn't, I would not have been able to predict the time, duration, and extent of day-to-day and week-over-week price reversals across that timeframe with any degree of statistical significance. There would also be a much poorer man standing before you.

But the real question for is, as I posed in yesterday's post, this: what is going to happen next? Just because I've gotten the past few months right, this doesn't mean I'll get the next few months right. I am, after all, just some guy. For this, we're going to have to zoom out a bit and take a look at our price action not only through daily, but weekly aggregation periods.

As I mentioned above, you'll recall that I expected our technical paradigm - a trading channel formed by the 50-day and 200-day Simple Moving Averages - to come to a close late this month or early next month. I hypothesized that this would occur as a result of the 50-day SMA and 200-day SMA meeting around that time.

I still believe that our technical paradigm will end at that time. However, **I no longer believe it will end as a result of the convergence of these two moving averages.**

Let me explain. Here is a chart of our price action leading up to and since Sneeze 2.0:

https://preview.redd.it/8mfor31z0xud1.png?width=1487&format=png&auto=webp&s=b4665463e35a28278ce8426dfe7b5dc38125334b

Since our double-top pattern back in May and June, GME has been in a bear trend. For awhile, this trend consolidated above the 50-day SMA likely as MMs internalized DFV's June share purchase and closed their FTDs leading up to July 16 when the price peaked at $29.99. At this point, however, GME slipped into a new paradigm and traded all the way down to the 200SMA where it found support amid the Nikkei crash on Aug 2. Since then, GME has tested the 50SMA several times as a resistance and retested the 200SMA (with a rising floor) transposed up by $1 as a result of the Q3 ATM cash infusion. 

Technically, Aug 2 is an important date. Why? Aug 2 is exactly 50 trading days prior to today. Why does this matter? This day is the 2nd lowest daily mean value in the past 90 trading days. All but one of the trading days before it and all of the trading days since it have higher average values. What this means, then, is that as we move forward in time the 50SMA will no longer be moving down, but begin to move UP in value on our daily chart. In addition to this, the stock price on our last downward test of the 200SMA could not log an average daily value of anything lower than $20.50.

At the same time, our 200SMA will continue to move up. With each passing day, daily price values of $10, $11, $12 are removed from the average value calculation while values of $20+ are added to the average. This pattern projects to continue until Sneeze 2.0 values are outside the calculation window of 200 trading days, or approximately 95 trading days from today.

This trend largely corresponds with our 50-week SMA in the following chart where we find our SMAs inverted:

https://preview.redd.it/giih4ogj4xud1.png?width=1584&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a8a9436c33d11cd078fdef27bfbbf22883bdc8d

Here we can see the 50-week SMA begin to make a slow curl up as it approaches the $20 price level. Currently its calculations extend back into November of 2023 where average weekly price levels were much lower than they are now. This, too. projects a continued uptrend in this technical level for the next 28 weeks or \~140 days. 

What this means from a technical perspective, is that our current trading channel need not close over the next few weeks, but rather that it will begin on the whole to slowly curl upward. Although our highs have been lower over Q3, our lows have become progressively higher by about $1 per month. 

While these are merely technical indicators and not mechanically binding, so far, they have corresponded to psychological respect on the part of the options market over the past three months. Whether that will continue is a matter for our observation. If this respect does continue, then GME will be entering into the set up for a bullish trend out into Q1 of 2025 which begins essentially now.

**IV Trends**

**Synthesis + TA;DR**

Our mild recovery this week to the upside has room to run and the market appears to have the will to let it continue based on yesterday's options activity. In technical dimensions, it looks like our technical paradigm will not so much expire, but transform from a consolidating, narrowing trading channel into an upward trending channel into Q1 2025 for the next 100 days or so. This may not be dramatic at first, but does promise to be consistent with higher lows soon to be accompanied by higher highs as well. We'll have to observe our upcoming options activity over the next few weeks to determine whether traders intend to continue to put credence in these factors - and whether a certain feline friend may have two cents to put toward the question... 

Good luck out there!

Cheers

Thanks again to everyone else as well for making this an excellent spot to share information, discussion, and community as we all try to learn more about the market and GME! My thanks especially to everyone who has voiced support in the comments, reached out directly, or bought me coffees to fuel these regular writing sessions before market open!

ADDITIONAL CLARIFICATION/DISCLAIMER: These posts are NOT intended as exhortations to buy and hold options contracts. I RARELY trade long options positions. When I do, I never hold more than 1% of my portfolio in long options and these days it is more like .01%. Options are structured to favor the DEALER. If you are randomly long options contracts because 'you feel it'll work' and you do not have a very well thought out and tested method for restructuring probability in your favor, you will lose. It is an iterative statistical certainty.

Open Interest (this post) is not \*trade advice\*. Its aim is epistemic or, if you prefer, scientific in nature, namely that the goal is to ascertain knowledge whose truth claim is that it confers some degree of predictive power. This is to say that the 'proof' of this is in whether advantageous use, however construed, can be made of the knowledge which I derive from observation and analysis by my particular methods. I use this knowledge to my advantage by continually updating, reassessing, and renewing my own investment thesis on continuing to HODL $GME. I happen to use a conservative wheel strategy (using CSPs and CCs to replace limit buys and limit sells) in order to maintain this position. How you put this knowledge to your advantage - if you should seek to - is up to you to discover and apply for yourself as an individual investor. Feel free, however, to ask as many questions as you please! I will do my best to share my experience and insight.",42,1728998805.0,Superstonk,11,0.96,False

# Chapter Three

  

How many times had I dreamed of this moment? How many nights had I imagined walking down the aisle, the love of my life waiting for me at the altar?

Everything was perfect. Almost everything. Except for the man standing at the end of that aisle, the man I was supposed to marry. The man whose eyes were filled with cold indifference instead of love. My heart ached, and I blinked back the tears threatening to spill, refusing to let them make a scene.

The ceremony was a blur, a haze of vows and traditions I barely registered. My thoughts were consumed with dread as I realized what awaited me — a home where I'd be alone with him, a man who clearly didn’t want me.

During the car ride back, Sorin sat as far away from me as the backseat allowed, his gaze fixed outside the window, his silence as heavy as the tension between us. I wanted to say something, anything to break the ice, but the fear of irritating him kept my lips sealed. I couldn’t help but glance at him, at his strong profile, every feature so painfully familiar from the countless times I'd admired him from afar.

“Quit staring. It's irritating.” His voice was icy, cutting through the silence like a blade. He cast me a brief glance, the look in his eyes sharper than his words.

“Sorry,” I whispered, my cheeks burning as I quickly looked away.

[*Italian Beige Sofa Bed*](https://pandacozycorner.com/products/italian-beige-sofa)



  
When we arrived at his house — no, his mansion — it felt like stepping into a dream, or rather, a nightmare. The place was as grand as one could imagine, but it held no warmth for me. It wasn’t a home; it was a gilded cage.

I followed him inside in silence, my stomach in knots as he led me to our bedroom. ""Our"" bedroom. I hadn’t expected that. Seeing the surprise on my face, he rolled his eyes and sighed. “My parents locked the other rooms. Apparently, they’re adamant that we sleep in the same one.”

Embarrassment washed over me. His parents clearly had hopes for this union that didn’t align with reality. He gestured towards the couch. “You’ll sleep there.”

I nodded, my throat too tight to speak. As I approached the couch, I noticed a pillow and blanket already laid out, a silent but clear arrangement. I sank into the cushions, trying to make myself comfortable.

""Wait."" His sudden command startled me. I turned, finding him pinching the bridge of his nose, visibly conflicted.

He sighed heavily. “Never mind.”

Confused, I resumed my place on the couch. But before I could relax, he spoke again. “No, wait.” He looked exasperated, as if warring with himself. “You can... share the bed. If you’re comfortable.” 

I hesitated, my eyes drifting to the bed. It was large enough for both of us, but sharing it felt too intimate, too overwhelming. Still, the couch wasn’t exactly inviting either.

“Are you sure?” I finally asked, my voice barely above a whisper.

He nodded stiffly. “Yes.”

Taking a deep breath, I got up and slowly made my way to the bed. He laid down on one side, and I settled on the other, making sure to keep as much distance as possible. My back was to him, and I prayed that sleep would come quickly, though I doubted it would.

Just as I was starting to relax, I heard the sound of pillows being moved. I glanced over my shoulder to see him placing a row of pillows between us.

“I hope you don’t kick in your sleep,” he muttered, his tone dry.

Heat rushed to my face. ""I don’t think I do,"" I mumbled, though I wasn’t entirely sure.

The night passed in tense silence, but at some point, I must have drifted off. A sudden groan woke me, and I blinked groggily, trying to figure out what had happened. My heart sank when I realized that, in my sleep, I had somehow managed to kick Sorin in the chest.

“Oh my God, I’m so sorry!” I gasped, covering my mouth in horror.

He glared at me, jaw clenched, clearly in pain. He shoved my leg back over to my side of the bed and got up without a word, heading straight for the bathroom.

“I’m sorry,” I called out again, desperate for some form of forgiveness. “Does it hurt a lot?”

He ignored me, his face a mask of irritation as he disappeared into the bathroom, slamming the door behind him. A tear slid down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Crying wouldn’t help. Nothing would.

I decided to make breakfast, hoping maybe it would soften the edges between us. By the time I finished, I heard him coming down the stairs, impeccably dressed in a navy blue suit. He looked just as handsome as ever, but he walked past the kitchen without a glance in my direction.

“Um… breakfast?” I stammered, trying to gather the courage to speak.

He paused for a fraction of a second, then continued walking toward the front door. Without so much as a word, he left, slamming the door behind him.

I stared at the untouched plates in front of me, my heart sinking further. I sat down at the table and forced myself to eat, though every bite tasted like ash. The lump in my throat grew with each passing second as the reality of my situation settled in.

Sorin would never love me. I was nothing more than an inconvenience to him, a burden he’d been forced to bear. My heart longed for something, someone to care about me, but all I had was emptiness.

Tears welled up again, but this time, I didn’t bother to fight them back. No one would see. No one cared.

I just wanted to be loved.

Grew up in upstate New York and the Chicago suburbs. Spent part of my youth metro Detroit, Michigan.  Sister went to school in RI.  Recently went back to RI with her and after visiting 42 of the 50 states, I have to call RI my favorite.  

1.  Food is excellent everywhere.  Too many good restaurants to name.   Coffee is superior to anything I've had in any major metro hub.  Providence being a culinary hotbed certainly has something to do with it.  
  
2.  RI in the fall is the best.   Taking Route 6 west into the smaller cities was the most relaxed I've felt in years.  Epic views.  
  
3.  I love that in one single day I can make day trips to the beach and the bigger cities and not feel taxed.  I can cover the entire state and do it all over the next day if I feel like it.     
  
4.  Speaking of the beach, walking Misquamicut State Beach as the sun dropped is probably one of the most beautiful moments of my entire life.

5.  Ivy League.  Seeing a Brown football game in that beautiful old stadium beats many of the experiences I've had going to major college football games where attendance for a single game is 80K plus.   Something about the tradition of that program just makes you love the sport even more, especially when college football just seems so corrupt.   We spoke to a few undergrads while there as my sister is a Brown alum and they are just so grounded and polite.  

6.  Providence is the most underrated city I've ever visited.   I can't recommend it enough.

7.  There is nothing more to say about Newport/Block Island that hasn't already been said.  Just mind blowing any way that you look at it.

Hope I didn't annoy anyone here, but I'm just very envious of those who get to live and work here.   I love Rhode Island.

Maybe it is that they had this perception that I am rich but I am always the person they ask for.

I wouldn’t mind that honestly but the fact that they were able to buy coffee, drinks or snacks in school which I tell you can cost a lot.. having no spare money for pamasahe is just not it. And usually when paying in cashier, I would paluwal muna but then they kind of forget to pay back.

I'm Tim (44) from Germany. I was diagnosed with thoracic disc herniation (Th6/7) 9 years ago. It plagued me around 1.5 years. It wasn't the pain (not very painful) but more the distress on the whole nervous system.. hxperreflexia, hyperesthesia.. didn't tolerate coffee anymore (Arghh ;-)).. sometimes it felt like a neuronal breakdown.. however, finally it vanished after a series of acupuncture treatments.. until last fall. I had some construction work to do at home and developed thoracic back pain afterwards. First I ignored it but it didn't go away. So I did another MRI scan in january. The result was TDH at 4 different levels an the old herniation can be seen unchanged. 
The pain reduced significantly but when I tried jogging 2 weeks ago it resulted in a substantially increased pain.. really annoying!
For me that means I must have done something wrong the last years (although it felt right) and now I'm searching for non-surgical rehab concepts specificially for the thoracic spine (I want to get fit again!)
Unfortunately, even for me as a doctor, it's difficult to find any useful information on this topic.
I bought an inversion table yesterday to release some spine tension but I can't find any informations on what excercises to do/avoid. Completely setting aside the possible reasons..

Do you guys have any experiences you could share or know any experts to contact? Even some useful literature would be very appreciated!

Recently however she’s been going through a tough time with her parents who she has had trouble with in the past. As I have a good relationship with my parents and always have I find it hard to relate to. But I try my best to comfort her and avoid giving her advice on how to deal with it as I know no matter what I say won’t be of much use.

She told me the other day she has felt really alone as everyone around her has their own problems and expect her to sit through hours of them talking about them without hearing her own. She told me she was tired of pretending to be interested in other peoples stories and said she wasn’t targeting it at me. I doubted this as I know I can sometimes talk about my own interests a fair amount but I’ve got much better at this in the recent years. She also has in the past critiqued the way I socialise around others which I have expressed I did not appreciate her doing that before but also did agree some of her points weren’t baseless.

It only becomes a problem since recently I told her I wanted to help her work through her problems and be able to support her. I asked for her to give me some pointers on how I should go about that. Her response was that I shouldn’t need advice on what to say as if I really cared how she felt I would know what to say. It’s really hurting me as I feel I am pushing her away and I don’t have anything to stop it. When we are together it’s still great but it’s when she’s sad I feel useless. 

To further salt the wound she dated someone last year for just a month or two, she told me they broke up as there wasn’t really any romance and they had been friends for months and continued to be afterwards. But she did say he was the only person she felt she could talk to and comfort her. At the beginning of our relationship she told me she was still friends with him and I was okay with that as long as she kept me in the loop if she was going to go meet him and that I’d like to meet him. It’s been 7 months now and I haven’t met him, about 2 months into the relationship I had gone home for the weekend and she went to meet him at a local village for the day, she didn’t tell me about it and I only found out when she gave me her phone to take a photo and a photo of him came up on her homescreen as a featured photo. I didn’t say anything at first as I assumed it was old but when I was lying in bed that evening I realised it was a very similar photo to one she had of me. Sat on a rowing boat under a tree and I checked the photo of me and sure enough the tree looked identical, more importantly still in bloom and it was impossible that photo could of been taken before I had started dating her. I confronted her and she told me she had gone to the same place as we had 2 weeks before as a send off as she had decided to stop talking to him and focus on her relationship with me. 

She had since completely cut off contact with him and showed me proof of it. I appreciated her honesty but also told her she needs to tell me things like this as it is shady behaviour no matter how innocent their relationship might be and makes me feel insecure (I am otherwise very secure I rarely feel jealous without a specific reason to be so).

Another couple months go by and we are doing great, I then see his texts begin to appear on her lock screen again. I never check her phone so I only ever saw parts of messages but she said she had just wanted to check up on him and they had some chats. 

Back to the past few weeks, since she has been going through it I have noticed more and more texts showing up. I understand if he is really that good at being an emotional friend then she would want to talk to him but she has not told me about it. It is making me seriously doubt myself and the relationship. 

Personally, I think that I should be the one to play the role he appears to be able to play, and without her support I can’t become good at that. I also know the vast majority, if not all of their contacting is through text which I believe leaves allot of ambiguity in messages that if you believe someone is a certain way you will read them as such. Meaning if I sent the exact same texts I don’t believe she would read them the same way. I feel with him in her life I cannot learn to support her and she doesn’t need me for the support if he is there.

She told me the other day she is going on a solo hike trip on her days off as she wanted some space from everyone around her, she always used to go on them before we met and since we have been dating we have always hiked together. She told me she was going on a specific hike that is quite dangerous at this time of year and was very vague on the details which I didn’t question too much as it’s her trip and I want her to have exactly what she said she wanted, an independent hike away from everyone. 

The day before she told me her plans I handed her her phone and briefly saw a text from him that said he had a nice phone call with her the night before when I was away and that he hopes she was feeling better. The next evening she texted me about her plans to go away on the two days. I might be imagining things but what if she is going to visit him. Not telling me again. He lives in London and so does my family so if she wanted to visit him openly I could drive down with her, let her have coffee with them and talk alone and I could meet him finally to really know who he is. And stay with my family. 

I’m really not sure what to do in this situation, I refuse to look through her phone to confirm any suspicions as I believe that is breaking fundamental trust and if I do that and find she is being honest with me I will feel like a fool. I don’t want to accuse her of anything either as she is not in the best headspace and that won’t make anything better. 

In my mind I want her to do 1 of 2 things:
1. Let me meet this friend and get to know him and her be open when she is talking to him.
2. Stop talking to him and help me understand her better.

Maybe I’m old fashioned but I believe I should be, as her partner, able to support her emotionally. Not entirely as of course there are things she would rather talk about amongst her girl friends, but enough that she doesn’t need to speak to her old friend/ex and keep it a secret from me. I know she knows it makes me feel insecure speaking to him so she might be trying to protect my feelings not telling me, but I don’t think she understands quite how much worse that is. It makes me imagine things I don’t want to. 

I know what allot of people might comment on this post and I would like to read all the responses, but she is a very trust worthy and honest person with me except with this topic. So I find it hard to believe she would entertain any romantic connection with someone else but her keeping it a secret obviously entertains that.

I have all of the reviews in their entirety posted over on my blog as part of my 31 Days of Horror (which I will not link to here because I know that's a no-no, but if you're familiar with my blog, you'll find them there today!)

**Traditional Sheet Ghost** (*cool white cotton, marshmallow fluff, and lemony Oman frankincense*) A farmers market fruit basket tumbles into the washing machine, emerges an olfactory apparition. High-thread-count luxury cotton sheets, spin cycle séance, rustling with tales of anemic fruits transfused with linen-fresh detergent. Bedclothes drift through air heavy with warm humidity and the powdery tang of fabric softener, an olfactory bedtime story of fruits gently haunting your freshly laundered linens.

**Datura Blossom** This impression of chlorinated florals, aquatic honey, and a slight mineral effervescence is not at all what I expected… although I think this is going to be a summertime favorite! . This is a midsummer fever dream, foamed with flowers, pearled with light. Narcotic petals lounging poolside: honey-sweet poisonous blooms take a dip in cerulean waters at high noon in mid-July, and they’re floating on neon pool noodles and drinking slightly flat but icy-cold Topo Chico. For those who appreciate such things, this one reminds me a bit of the long-discontinued Danube.

**Hollow Hallow** (a suffocating pumpkin kyphi soaked in dark red wine and darkened by vetiver, opoponax, and black oud) The pores of the earth yawn open, exuding an inky miasma perfumed with earthy autumnal spices and sweet brown sugar musk. This glazed, glistening cascade of aromatic sap gleams under a harvest moon, a glossy pool of honeyed incense golden and thick, an aromatic oil slick of resinous warmth and syrupy darkness. From the viscous depths, a pumpkin-headed silhouette emerges, its hollow eyes glowing with ancient malice—an old god awakening to reclaim its hallowed home.

**The Great and Titled Dead** (the haunted stillness of a long-decayed cemetery plot choked by ivy and wild blackberry thorns) Did I hear a blackberry giggle? And why did it sound so chilling, soulless, and evil? A chorus of tiny, wicked voices rises from the brambles, their sweet menace carried on a gentle breeze. The scent drifts lightly, deceptively airy, its delicate touch belying the weight of ancient malice it carries.

**Tropical Print Sheet Ghost** (cascades of banana Leaf, bamboo fiber, mango, papaya, and hibiscus, streaked with ectoplasm and sticky tears of strelitzia sap) I always list the notes with these reviews because sometimes I forget myself and get lost in impressions or dreams or memories or go off on labyrinthine tangents that stray very far from perfumereviewlandia. In this case, it is helpful to share the perfumer’s notes because I am going to list a very different set of smeller’s notes: honeydew, rhubarb, & honeysuckle preserves, a translucent shiver of ginger leaf, a rosebud preening, its reflection glassy and cool in a pool of still rainwater. Fresh, clear nectar, lush and swirling in a prismatic jelly jar, balancing on a small tray carved of young, green wood.

**Pumpkin Latte** (espresso, pumpkin syrup, smoky vanilla bean, milk, raw sugar, and a dash of cinnamon and nutmeg) I don’t know how I’ve been reviewing these Halloween scents for so long, and yet I have never talked about this one. Perhaps it’s because it’s been lurking in the shadows, biding its time, waiting for the perfect moment to reveal its true nature. And that nature? It’s not what you’d expect.  The coffee is strong and smoky, a dark roast rebellion against the expected sweetness. This is not the sticky-sweet pumpkin syrup bomb of your coffee-chain drive-thru order with your name spelled ridiculously wrong (ugh, poor “Keighleigh”). Instead, imagine a barista witch concocting a potion of bitter mysteries and autumnal secrets in a cauldron of burnished copper. Vanilla bean smoke curls around the edges, more felt than tasted, while cinnamon and nutmeg whisper spicy nothings from the shadows. A ribbon of milk weaves through it all, not to soften but to complicate – binding the realms of wake and sleep, summer’s fading warmth, and winter’s approaching chill. Raw sugar lingers as an afterthought, crunching softly like leaves underfoot or the last grains of sand in October’s hourglass. This is a PSL for those who find comfort in decay and seek beauty in the turn of seasons – a not-too-sweet (ultimate compliment) toast to endings that taste like new beginnings.",4,1728998229.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

This espresso blend is honestly one of the smoothest I’ve tried in a while. It’s a well-balanced medium roast with subtle floral and fruity notes. I love that it gives a clean, sweet finish without that overwhelming bitterness some espressos tend to have.

I initially brewed it using my French Press, but I didn’t quite enjoy it. The flavor just didn’t come through as I’d hoped. However, when I tried it with my AeroPress, it was an entirely different story—pure magic! The flavors really popped, and it turned into the best home-brewed coffee I’ve ever had.

If anyone’s looking for a lighter, more refined espresso experience, give this a shot—especially if you’ve got an AeroPress! Highly recommend. 😊",1,1728998169.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

I have a ton of low level items (1-3 star, gray and blue items) that I got from grinding the item dungeon. I have about 500+ items and will probably hit the item cap soon. Is it safe to get rid of them, and if so, what's the best way to do this?

Also I have a few more questions about items/inventory in general:

* In the item dungeon, I'm grinding lvl 60s and the reward list includes a 4 star + 5 star item. Are these guaranteed drops, or just a chance to get them? I'm mostly getting 1-3 star, gray and blue items. Not sure if that's supposed to happen, or if my game is bugged out.
* Is there any chance of getting epic or legendary drops from grinding the item dungeon? I'm just wondering if this is a good alternative to spending gems or mileage tickets, or if I'm just wasting coffee.
* I recently unlocked the blacksmith and now have the option of doing mystery evolution. Should I bother using this function this early on, or is it better to wait for end game?
* Can someone give me a dumbed down explanation of how mystery evolution works? I tried putting a few duplicate items to test out, but only like 5% of my inventory actually shows up when I select something. Also I hear you should always use the filter to avoid accidentally deleting essential items. Problem is, any time I put on any sort of filter, it filters out everything.

Having said that: over the past few days I have tried to create a book containing all the D&D spells. I liked the idea of ​​having a physical version of my wizard's book, containing real spells. As a cover (since I didn't feel like creating one) I used that of an old book that someone wanted to throw away.

The book turned out decently well (for my first attempt) but I had some problems with the paper. The one I bought was too thin, and you could see the writing on the back page. Do you have advice on the thickness of paper to buy? The thickness of the paper I used does not appear on the packaging, only that it weighed 75g per sheet.



Furthermore, since I had already decided that I wanted to try again from the beginning, I then tried to age the book using coffee diluted with water. The effect wasn't bad but the content of the book was ruined and it no longer reads very well. Tips for improving page aging?

So I would sleep until 745-8am, get up, make us both coffee and wake him up to drink it. 

I'd get our toddler up, assuming she hadn't already woken up on her own and change her diaper and then she either snuggles with daddy for a while or goes into her play pen to play while I finish getting ready to work.

I'd go to work for 9am (wfh) and shortly after he'd make the two of them breakfast, they watch part of a Pixar movie together while they eat and then play for a while, nap time and he'd drop her off with the sitter before work in the afternoon.

The routine was great! Everyone involved was getting more sleep and it was a nice lazy way to spend a morning before work. 

Now he's gone and volunteered to take over a co-workers shifts this week (idk for how many shifts) and he has to be at freaking work for 8am.

So now I'm stuck waking up at 630 in the damn morning so I can make coffee, pack and the toddlers bags and make her breakfast/lunch. I get to sit for like 15 minutes by the time everything is said and done. 

I have to wake the toddler early to get her dressed and strapped into her carseat so her grandpa can pick her up at 8am and take her to the babysitter. 

I'm fucking tired. I despise early mornings and we FINALLY had a decent routine between us and he's fucked it up. Doesn't bother him any because if anything, it means less work for him to deal with because he doesn't have to cook, pack anything or get our daughter ready to leave the house. 

I realize he's trying to be nice by taking the shifts but fuck me, just stop. Stick with your proper shift. Stop completely rearranging our days on a whim with only a few hours notice and expecting me to pick up all the pieces that now need arranging.

**Moms**, when you think of **Michael Jackson**, a lot of things come to mind: the ***Moonwalk***, iconic music videos, sequined gloves and of course his angelic voice.  But did you know that beneath the dazzling lights and high notes, **Michael Jackson** was secretly a ***business mastermind***?  That's right, and if you’re a **mom** looking to dominate the **entrepreneurial world**, there’s one book that may be able to teach you how to channel that **MJ magic** into **your empire**, ***”MomPreneurs”*** a very serious well thought out **business guide for moms**.  

Yes, you read that right.  Forget the ***’Thriller’*** album; the real thriller was how **MJ** ran his ***business empire*** from **Neverland**.  And what was **his greatest secret**?  Multitasking – something **moms** have been doing since the dawn of time.  He wrote songs while riding a Ferris Wheel, negotiated record deals while feeding llamas, and choreographed the greatest dance moves of all time during PTA meetings, *(probably)*.  

**Lesson 1: Master the Moonwalk of Business Planning**

While many think ***the Moonwalk*** is just a fancy dance move, it’s actually an ***elite business strategy***.  One step forward, two steps back – just like building a company!  You have to take a few risks, but if you’re slick enough, you can glide past the competition with ease.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn how to **Moonwalk** through your day – from diaper duty to client meetings – without breaking a sweat (or spilling that ever-important cup of coffee).  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 2: Be the Smooth Criminal of Your Niche**

**MJ** wasn’t just the ***King of Pop*** – he was the ***Smooth Criminal*** of branding.  Did you ever wonder how he always stood out in the music industry?  He wore ONE glove.  Genius.  Just like that, ***MomPreneurs*** will teach you how to craft a business brand so memorable that it’ll leave your competition asking, ***“Annie, are you okay?”***  

**Moms,** you don’t need to be the best at ***everything***; you just need to be memorable ***in your business niche.***  And hey, who better to teach you that than **Michael**, the guy who turned a white glove into a legacy?  

**Lesson 3: Build Your Own Neverland (*****AKA*****, Your Dream Business)**

***Neverland*** wasn’t just a place for frolicking around with **Bubbles the chimpanzee**; it was **Michael’s** dream world.  In ***MomPreneurs***, you'll learn to create your own version of **Neverland** – a business where work feels like play, and you rule with benevolence (and maybe a couple of Ferris Wheels if that’s your thing).  **MJ** knew how to escape into his passion, and with this book, you’ll do the same – whether it’s running a cake shop, launching a boutique, or starting a ***mom-run empire*** from your kitchen table.  [Click here to get our exclusive offer on this incredible Mompreneur eBook](https://skysebooksplus.com/b/sFmMY), **it's $13.49 - that’s 33% off** its original price, **so act now!** 

**Lesson 4: Harness the Power of** ***The Glove***

I can't call myself a TLD completionist until I've done this one challenge. It stresses me out, though. I've died several times in the region I spawned in, just not understanding the rules, then I could get a few pages but die to wolves later (no headphones!)

Now.ive got headphones and a good start but I need suggestions. 

I started in Bleak Inlet, took a roundabout route through all the sheds and even briefly through the cannery and cars. Even got a few hours sleep before the timer was up! Got an early flaregun and many shells. Slept hours at a time at the fire while I made water and teas. Dropped a lure and went to cave via the delta cabin.

Took the long way west in FM after dropping a lure, finding my first of several low condition pistols near the farmstead. Looked for the prepper cache and couldn't find it. Went the long way around to the exit to BR.

BR was straightforward, rested at fire after looting the interiors and some lucky sweaters. Slept, lured and escaped with 8 mins on the fog. Took the train tracks.to the FM lure and on to mystery lake. Searched lodge and  managed to sleep a little before hitting the fire and taking a long diagonal to Trappers and the cave to Milton.

Dang near killed myself goating down and needed coffee and go juice foe the climb out. Was bingo energy and hands for the last few aching seconds! Thought I was toast. The DW was near when I blitzed through the park on coffee fumes. Found the paradise key (hadn't before) and briefly looted inside (water,.coffee. another pistol). I'd declined to pick up the ML rifle.

Headed for HRV after a close call with DW, after finding I was without glyph paint. Not sure where it went but I'd been using it at need. Was worried HRV would.be difficult as I'm.not good with it at the best of.tjmes but it was pretty straightforward. Sprained three limbs and lost my pants goating down the climb, stimmed it up and limped to the fire for a fire hour nap. DW right behind me, lured and took a go juice back up the climb. He was nipping my heels the whole way.

Took the cave and managed to get < 3 hours sleep at the exit. Woke up when DW was near, then left the cave
 Still near!

So now I'm in MT. I believe I have 5 pages now.and there's 5 more?. I'm low on energy. Have no bandages or.stims but lots of coffee. I need to get to coastal which means ravine which means mystery lake. So do I head down two ropes into the basin into FM again or go back the way I came down up into ML? I've not used any wards nor really know how they work. Should I ward and sleep in any region I'm not coming back to?",2,1728996492.0,thelongdark,1,1.0,False
1g46v5d,https://www.reddit.com/r/T4T_SanAntonio/comments/1g46v5d/welcome/,Welcome!,"### Overview

If you are gender nonconforming and looking for other trans and non-binary people in SA, hopefully, this can become the group for us.

### Goals

1. Create a safe online community for gender non-conforming people of San Antonio, TX
2. Facilitate a *Monthly Mingle*. We'll play board/card games and hangout at a good coffee shop or mellow bar.
3. Facilitate 2-4 special meetups per year. LGBT rights advocacy, enjoying festivals, or whatever the consensus is.

### Secondary Goals

- Be a source of shared resources to help others navigate their transition. ^(Typical rules apply. Do not violate Reddit or legal TOS.)
- Expand awareness of this group to more gender nonconforming people.

### Not Goals

- If you meet someone you hit it off with, great! But this is not a dating group, it is a friend group.
- Exclude allies, but I don't see how to safely include them unless they are invited by a T4T member to our meetup. Please advise.

### Concerns

- **Safely Meet:** *Future problem*. If someone knows more than I, please advise. Current plan is to discuss details in the Lex group with a rotating meetup spot. Early on we can probably meet at the same place, but if the group grows this may need to be implemented.
- **Safely Screen:** I have no idea how to screen people inclusively to make sure we get T4T demographics. Please advise! Current plan is likely inadequate, but meets the minimum criteria for groups that aren't targeted. Seems stupid to spell it out here, so I won't. It needs improvement, please advise.
- **Lex Admins:** I don't see how to add admins. As such, the group is entirely dependent on me to continue functioning. That's not a good thing. We either need a better platform to discuss details or we need admins.

### Affiliated Accounts:

- **Lex:** [T4T San Antonio](https://lex.lgbt/g/T4T+San+Antonio-iz8BgrZ97B)
- **Instagram:** *pending*
- **Twitter:** *pending*
- no group feature, but **HER** app is recommended

I hope that you're all doing fine.

You might want to go and make yourself a cup of tea/coffee for this one. It's going to be a long one.

This is a bit of an unusual post to make I suppose, but I felt compelled to as I actively reached out to this community and received some stellar advice that served me very well.

To cut a long story short, I have had a number of unsightly little spots on my penis (as well as around my eyes) since the age of 9. 

Throughout my teens and 20s I have repeatedly seen doctors about it who have done nothing, they are symptomless, not at all painful/uncomfortable, but are very unsightly and the spots have made if so that the couple of instances in which I have dropped my gaurd and been prepared to have relations with someone (given my self conscious about the condition, that takes a lot), I have been rejected in both instances, with one of the woman even recoiling in digust and asking me to leave. 

This defect has effectively caused me to be a desperately depressed and lonely 29 year old man, who has never experienced what it is to be in a relationship/relations due to the complex I have had around it and fear that being turned away once more would completely destroy me. Quite the vicious circle indeed.

Now, all this is just the context, my backstory and I'm not sympathy chasing here. I have come to terms with these things and am on a self-improvement crusade to ensure that my 30s are worthwhile, though I am aware that in my particular circumstances that there's going to be a real uphill battle.

Incredibly frustrated and fed up of my predicament, a couple of months ago I spent about £1000 to get 7 of the most prominent growths removed through a private clinic. During the consultation, I was told that I had Genital Warts, which I thought impossible, given that I've never had sexual relations of any kind. 

Upon telling my Mother about the treatment that I received, she relayed that she had genital warts when she gave birth to me and upon doing a wee bit of research, I found that a child could get warts/HPV from the mother during birth, though this is very rare, knowing my luck (or rather lack of), it appeared to be perfectly feasible.

I then consulted you folks here and was advised by several people to go to a sexual health clinic, which I did about a month ago.

Let me just say that, as it turns out, that was the single best bit of advice I have been given here and me attending one set the wheels in motion for action finally being taken and fingers crossed, some monumental change on the horizon.
Anyway, to cut to the chase, it turns out I don't have HPV and was missdiagnosed (much like I was in my youth) by the Doctor at the private clinic who conveniently then proceeded to take my £1000 for the procedure. The procedure did indeed get rid of 7 of thr largest ones, but the sexual health clinic at one point got 4 Doctors and consultants in the room, all agreeing that whatever I did have was not Genital warts, which was later confirmed when my blood results came back negative for all STDs/STIs. 

Good news on the whole, but this now had me asking more questions and being further bamboozled by what I had. 

The most cutting part was after I explained everything that I had gone through to and how it had effected my life so severely, the head clinician told me that it may have to be something I just live with and that my options are to find a woman who can look past it (that's very easy to say when you haven't lived with it for your entire adult life). I was pretty chocked, but to the clinic's immeasurable credit, they went out of their way to pursue a referral for me, to my local NHS Dermatology Specialist team as a matter of ""Urgency"". Pictures were taken, calls where made ect.  Miracles do happen as I got an appointment at my hospital within a fortnight (practically unheard of here in England) and I saw a doctor there.

The Doctor at the hospital corroborated what the staff in the Sexual Health Clinic Stated, by saying that it definitely wasn't Genital Warts and that the private practice I went to (which I researched and is considered to be quite reputable) didn't do their due diligence and give me a report on the treatment that I had received. She also advised that I wasn't appropriately cautioned on scaring which lined-up with what the sexual health clinic said when they opted not to go the cryotherapy route, in fear that these non-GW spots could leave permanent scars.

Ultimately, she couldn't tell what the spots where either, but deciphered that the ones around my eyes are the exact same and got me booked in for a biopsy.

As of writing this, I had the biopsy a couple of hours ago and will receive results within 6 weeks. From there, the same doctor that I met a couple of weeks ago will look into seeing of treatment is possible and if indeed it is possible on The NHS.

So there you have it. Turns out it's not HPV. 

The reason I posted this here though is that it was a follow-up I though would be well worth giving everyone a heads-up on as this community has been extremely helpful and understanding and for those of you who took the time out of your day to read about my plight and make recommendations (which have ultimately helped) I really do thank you from the bottom of my heart!

I hope that all of you out there are able to overcome, live fulfilling lives and even do away with this horrible affliction. ",5,1728996360.0,HPV,1,1.0,False
1g46tlv,https://www.reddit.com/r/celebrityweightlose/comments/1g46tlv/jenna_and_emmas_journey_to_health_a_java_burn/,Jenna and Emma’s Journey to Health: A Java Burn Transformation,"Jenna Thompson stood in her cozy kitchen in Seattle, gazing out the rain-speckled window while her seven-year-old son, Noah, played in the next room. As she sipped her morning coffee, a familiar pang of frustration washed over her. At 38, balancing a fast-paced career in graphic design and the demands of motherhood left little room for self-care. The weight she had been struggling with for years seemed immovable, despite her best efforts. Jenna often scrolled through social media, watching friends post about fitness achievements, but she felt stuck—tethered to routines that yielded little progress.

Then, one rainy Saturday morning, everything changed. As she scrolled through her phone, a blog post titled ""Java Burn—A Game-Changer or Just Hype?"" caught her eye. The article spoke about a weight loss supplement that blended effortlessly with her daily coffee routine. Java Burn was made with natural ingredients like chlorogenic acid and green tea extract, promising to boost metabolism and support weight loss without the jittery side effects Jenna feared from traditional pills. It almost sounded too good to be true. But what truly piqued her interest was the 60-day money-back guarantee, which made Jenna think, “Why not?” She had nothing to lose but the stubborn pounds she had been carrying around for years. That same day, Jenna ordered Java Burn, ready to see if this could be the turning point she had been waiting for.

**Meanwhile, Across the Country in Chicago...**

Emma Carter, a 39-year-old marketing executive, was living a life not too different from Jenna’s. Long hours at the office, endless deadlines, and the constant pressure to stay ahead in her career left little time for healthy habits. The stubborn weight around her midsection only added to her stress. Despite trying numerous diets and workout plans, the results always seemed fleeting.

One evening, while Emma scrolled through her favorite health blog, she stumbled upon the same article Jenna had found—Java Burn. Like Jenna, Emma was skeptical at first but intrigued by the promise of an easy addition to her coffee routine. The natural ingredients, the idea of boosting her metabolism without disrupting her day, and, of course, the fact that it didn’t change the taste of her beloved morning coffee seemed like a win-win. With hope and a bit of caution, Emma clicked the order button.

[Java Burn](https://preview.redd.it/hjfcqopsuvud1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=657653b5a21d2280cff47bfbf125cab9899f819d)

**The Start of a New Routine**

Within days, both women had Java Burn packets in hand. Jenna, in Seattle, and Emma, in Chicago, added the powder to their morning coffee with nervous anticipation. For Jenna, the first few days were surprisingly uneventful. Her coffee tasted the same, her mornings were still chaotic, but after about a week, she noticed something subtle: her energy levels were different. She wasn’t crashing mid-afternoon, and her cravings for snacks throughout the day were significantly reduced.

In Chicago, Emma had a similar experience. Her energy was up, and for the first time in years, she felt like she wasn’t dragging through the workday. Even more exciting, her clothes started fitting better, and she saw the number on the scale slowly inching down.

**A Chance Encounter and a Growing Friendship**

Despite being 2,000 miles apart, Jenna and Emma’s paths were destined to cross. Jenna, during a coffee meet-up with her longtime friend Lisa, couldn’t help but share her excitement about her experience with Java Burn. Lisa, intrigued by Jenna’s progress, decided to give it a shot herself. Around the same time, Emma confided in her friend Sarah, who had also struggled with weight loss. Sarah, hearing Emma’s success, jumped on board, excited to try something new.

As the weeks passed, both Jenna and Emma found their lives shifting. Jenna shed 25 pounds and felt more connected to her family. She initiated outdoor activities with Noah, from hiking to bike rides, feeling lighter and more engaged. Emma’s journey was equally rewarding; she lost 10 pounds, but more importantly, she regained her energy and confidence. Her work performance improved, and she found herself rediscovering a sense of balance in her life.

**Staying the Course: The Power of Friendship**

Of course, their journeys weren’t without challenges. Jenna hit a plateau after a month of steady progress, and the frustration was hard to ignore. Emma, too, found herself feeling disheartened when the weight loss slowed. But both women had their friends—Lisa and Sarah—by their sides. During difficult days, they would remind each other that health wasn’t just about the number on the scale but about feeling good and making sustainable lifestyle changes. Their friendships became an essential part of their success.

Eventually, Jenna and Emma connected with each other through their mutual friends, forming an online support group. They shared recipes, workout tips, and stories of their ups and downs. More than anything, they celebrated the small victories—the moments when they felt stronger, lighter, and more confident.

**A Celebration of Success**

Months later, as both Jenna and Emma reflected on their journeys, they realized how far they had come—not just in terms of weight loss but in how they felt about themselves. Java Burn had been the catalyst, but it was their commitment, support, and determination that had driven the transformation.

To mark the occasion, Jenna and Emma organized a virtual celebration with Lisa, Sarah, and their close friends. They shared their stories, talking about how a small change—a simple addition to their morning coffee—had led to big results. The gathering wasn’t just a celebration of weight loss but of empowerment, friendship, and the strength found in taking control of one’s health.

**A Final Reflection**

Jenna and Emma’s journey with Java Burn serves as a reminder that change doesn’t have to be dramatic or complicated. Sometimes, it’s the small, consistent steps—like adding a supplement to your daily routine—that lead to the most significant transformations. For these two women, Java Burn wasn’t just a weight-loss solution; it was the start of a new chapter in their lives.

Their story is one of hope, resilience, and the power of community. If you’ve been struggling with your weight or feeling stuck, take it from Jenna and Emma: sometimes, all it takes is that first step—one cup of coffee at a time. **Start your transformation today with Java Burn, which will make a difference in your way of life.** [https://javaburn.com/](https://freezegluco.com/Javaburn.html)",2,1728996314.0,celebrityweightlose,1,1.0,False

In terms of side effects I’m not really getting a dry mouth or trouble urinating I have noticed my eyes are slightly dry but not too bad. 

Only one side effect I have noticed is that it feels like it my heart rate is increased or maybe it’s just paranoia.  It’s like the same feeling when I drink too much coffee.  Also I read it can cause erectile dysfunction or libido issues.

This happened to me the other night but I don’t know if that was because of the medication because I have also had ED issues in the past.

I'll admit I almost smoked on my day off, I took my Friday off, but I beat the impulse...so, I'm sticking to my program of not going out to smoke on my breaks, and make the same record while at work...I did notice health improvements during my quick fast and I should probably keep that up.

For now, gotta survive the week. And maybe work on my marriage some more. I'm starting to feed my baby more by spoon feeding her with milk. I hope she gains weight...and hopefully I'll be a more darling wife to my husband. Lol. I wish. I hope. I just hated him all weekend and we got to each other's nerves.

Him: I'm still thinking about it. You?

As with weather, so with astrology. 

Now, onto the special of the week! 

Planetary effects, at least for me, start about 2 days before and after, so I looked at the calendar and.. that explains it. I accidentally dropped my pint of coffee first thing in the morning and nearly had a meltdown, you can tell I’ve done enough trauma work to be able to identify what’s going on. And I’ve done enough (basic) astrology to understand that a Cardinal Grand Cross of a super full moon is no cakewalk either. A Grand Cross is four bodies arranged in a cross formation, and these four planets/bodies fall in the Big Four cardinal signs, Moon in Aries, Mars in Cancer, Sun in Libra, and our not-such-a-favorite Pluto in Capricorn.

If you look at the lines I’ve shaded in yellow, that shows the 4 bodies connected.

[Planetdance](https://www.jcremers.com) is a labor of love, donate if you can. (Not an advertisement. It's free software after all, service in the spirit of the Old Internet 1.0, and that has my utmost respect.)

According to [astrology.com](http://astrology.com), “A grand cardinal cross is the most challenging modality of all the crosses as it holds the most power. Cardinal signs initiation\[sic\] action and take the lead, so this grand cross feels like four alphas are fighting to take the lead. You may feel constantly pulled between different directions without knowing how to begin.” I normally try to provide some to-do advice in my forecast, but I’m feeling at a loss myself, which ties in very much with this explanation, so I will have to leave it to your own inner guidance as to what may work best for you under this transit. - [https://www.astrology.com/article/grand-cross-astrology/](https://www.astrology.com/article/grand-cross-astrology/)

What we do know though, is that the battle for the future intensifies, as above so below, as within ourselves so without in the larger world, so be on guard for bad behavior, acting out, power struggles, inner and outer battles, and all of that is amplified by the supermoon, which occurs when the moon is closer to earth than usual. The science folk have also confirmed that the supermoon’s proximity results in higher gravitational pull and greater effects on oceanic tides. - [https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/super-full-moon.html](https://www.timeanddate.com/astronomy/moon/super-full-moon.html)

Add the grand cross to the supermoon and even a student astrologer like me gets it: this is easily observable, if you can see the moon, it looks visually bigger and brighter to the eye. Not to mention, Kai’s wisdom about the moon lifting trillions of tons of water, now, with more moon and more trillions this weekend, like a value pack on sale with 20% extra free. 😆

They used to say the full moon brings out the crazies? Well they weren’t wrong: even the non witch folk will feel this special offer. 

Full Moon is exact at 4:26am PDT. Be safe.

SynaBoost is a cognitive booster that promotes brain wellness. It improves thinking, focus, and memory with the help of its natural ingredients. People who are experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, and concentration issues can start taking this supplement and see their cognitive health improving within months. 

Natural cognitive boosters have been popularized lately, and there are plenty of them available in the market. SynaBoost is a new addition to them, but it has achieved a very high customer rating within a short time, showing its amazing success rate. 

Here is everything that you must know about SynaBoost.



# SynaBoost Reviews

As mentioned before, SynaBoost is an advanced cognition enhancing formula made with plant-based ingredients. It makes your cognitive functions better, and as a result, you are able to perform better in brainy tasks such as thinking, analyzing, problem-solving, focusing, memory building, etc.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good. 

Unlike other companies that are ruining after profits only, SynaBoost has nothing to hide. In fact, it takes pride in this formulation and makes it available to common people. You can even compare these ingredients with other cognitive boosters to see what makes this one better.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

SynaBoost is a cognitive booster that promotes brain wellness. It improves thinking, focus, and memory with the help of its natural ingredients. People who are experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, and concentration issues can start taking this supplement and see their cognitive health improving within months. 

Natural cognitive boosters have been popularized lately, and there are plenty of them available in the market. SynaBoost is a new addition to them, but it has achieved a very high customer rating within a short time, showing its amazing success rate. 

Here is everything that you must know about SynaBoost.



# SynaBoost Reviews

As mentioned before, SynaBoost is an advanced cognition enhancing formula made with plant-based ingredients. It makes your cognitive functions better, and as a result, you are able to perform better in brainy tasks such as thinking, analyzing, problem-solving, focusing, memory building, etc.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines.

SynaBoost is a cognitive booster that promotes brain wellness. It improves thinking, focus, and memory with the help of its natural ingredients. People who are experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, and concentration issues can start taking this supplement and see their cognitive health improving within months. 

Natural cognitive boosters have been popularized lately, and there are plenty of them available in the market. SynaBoost is a new addition to them, but it has achieved a very high customer rating within a short time, showing its amazing success rate. 

Here is everything that you must know about SynaBoost.



# SynaBoost Reviews

As mentioned before, SynaBoost is an advanced cognition enhancing formula made with plant-based ingredients. It makes your cognitive functions better, and as a result, you are able to perform better in brainy tasks such as thinking, analyzing, problem-solving, focusing, memory building, etc.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good. 

Unlike other companies that are ruining after profits only, SynaBoost has nothing to hide. In fact, it takes pride in this formulation and makes it available to common people. You can even compare these ingredients with other cognitive boosters to see what makes this one better.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

# [Click Here To Visit – “OFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://shorturl.at/uttMm)”✅_

**Bacopa Monnieri**

Bacopa has been a famous name in traditional medicine for many reasons, one of which is its role in cognition. It enhances memory and shortens the attention span and processing of information. It also calms the brain, making stress manageable and less damaging for the body.

**Huperzia Serrata**

Huperzia has many benefits to offer, but its action on neurons is remarkable. T enhances the levels of acetylcholine and makes learning, thinking, and remembering information easier. Further, it lowers the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s in old age.

**Magnesium Stearate**

The last ingredient in this list is magnesium stearate, which acts as a protective barrier for the brain. It prevents damage and injuries, causing a permanent effect. Its benefits include making lifelong memories, helping the brain to think clearly, and removing brain fog.



# Dosage Guidelines

SynaBoost is an easy-to-use capsule that can be swallowed with water. There are 30 pills inside, making 30 doses, so the daily intake should be no more than one capsule. This one capsule is enough to bring the changes in your brain health that you desire. So, there is no need to overdose. 

There is no fixed time to take this supplement, and it can be taken at any hour of the day. For your own convenience, it is better to set a time every day so that the daily dose is never missed. Most people like to take it early in the morning so that they do not miss it if they have a busy day ahead.

It should preferably be used with a large meal. Do not take it in the morning if you are not a breakfast person; instead, take it after any big meal of the day. Never take it with alcohol, only water or juices are the recommended choices to be taken with it. 

If you are already on a medicine or using a supplement, make sure it is not taken with SynaBoost. Or there is a chance of experiencing a cross-reaction with the ingredients. Thus, take one supplement at a time.

# SynaBoost Reviews

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

SynaBoost is a cognitive booster that promotes brain wellness. It improves thinking, focus, and memory with the help of its natural ingredients. People who are experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, and concentration issues can start taking this supplement and see their cognitive health improving within months. 

Natural cognitive boosters have been popularized lately, and there are plenty of them available in the market. SynaBoost is a new addition to them, but it has achieved a very high customer rating within a short time, showing its amazing success rate. 

Here is everything that you must know about SynaBoost.



# SynaBoost Reviews

As mentioned before, SynaBoost is an advanced cognition enhancing formula made with plant-based ingredients. It makes your cognitive functions better, and as a result, you are able to perform better in brainy tasks such as thinking, analyzing, problem-solving, focusing, memory building, etc.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good. 

Unlike other companies that are ruining after profits only, SynaBoost has nothing to hide. In fact, it takes pride in this formulation and makes it available to common people. You can even compare these ingredients with other cognitive boosters to see what makes this one better.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

# [Click Here To Visit – “OFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://shorturl.at/uttMm)”✅_

**Bacopa Monnieri**

Bacopa has been a famous name in traditional medicine for many reasons, one of which is its role in cognition. It enhances memory and shortens the attention span and processing of information. It also calms the brain, making stress manageable and less damaging for the body.

**Huperzia Serrata**

Huperzia has many benefits to offer, but its action on neurons is remarkable. T enhances the levels of acetylcholine and makes learning, thinking, and remembering information easier. Further, it lowers the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s in old age.

**Magnesium Stearate**

The last ingredient in this list is magnesium stearate, which acts as a protective barrier for the brain. It prevents damage and injuries, causing a permanent effect. Its benefits include making lifelong memories, helping the brain to think clearly, and removing brain fog.



# Dosage Guidelines

SynaBoost is an easy-to-use capsule that can be swallowed with water. There are 30 pills inside, making 30 doses, so the daily intake should be no more than one capsule. This one capsule is enough to bring the changes in your brain health that you desire. So, there is no need to overdose. 

There is no fixed time to take this supplement, and it can be taken at any hour of the day. For your own convenience, it is better to set a time every day so that the daily dose is never missed. Most people like to take it early in the morning so that they do not miss it if they have a busy day ahead.

It should preferably be used with a large meal. Do not take it in the morning if you are not a breakfast person; instead, take it after any big meal of the day. Never take it with alcohol, only water or juices are the recommended choices to be taken with it. 

If you are already on a medicine or using a supplement, make sure it is not taken with SynaBoost. Or there is a chance of experiencing a cross-reaction with the ingredients. Thus, take one supplement at a time.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

SynaBoost is a cognitive booster that promotes brain wellness. It improves thinking, focus, and memory with the help of its natural ingredients. People who are experiencing brain fog, forgetfulness, and concentration issues can start taking this supplement and see their cognitive health improving within months. 

Natural cognitive boosters have been popularized lately, and there are plenty of them available in the market. SynaBoost is a new addition to them, but it has achieved a very high customer rating within a short time, showing its amazing success rate. 

Here is everything that you must know about SynaBoost.



# SynaBoost Reviews

As mentioned before, SynaBoost is an advanced cognition enhancing formula made with plant-based ingredients. It makes your cognitive functions better, and as a result, you are able to perform better in brainy tasks such as thinking, analyzing, problem-solving, focusing, memory building, etc.

It can be used in routine, like a multivitamin, and could take a few weeks to show its results. There are no complexities involved in this product, and regular use of it can save you from age-related cognition loss in the long run.

# How Does SynaBoost Work?

SynaBoost uses its herbal ingredients to enhance brain health and memory. These ingredients have unique benefits to offer, and as a combination, they work and fix six areas determining your brain performance.

These areas include reasoning, focus, memory building, accuracy analysis, learning, and concentration. These effects do not just magically show up after you start taking the supplement. It is a slow and gradual process that could take months. In addition to these, the SynaBoost pills can work on your mood and stress levels, making them better.

These benefits take a slow pace but become much more prominent after a consistent usage of months. The most likable part here is that these effects do not vanish when you stop taking SynaBoost, which is a common thing with most supplements and medicines. 

This formula works to heal the damage from inside, and not just the symptoms. That is why its results have a deep and long impact. No matter if you stop using the supplement after a few months, the results will still be there, making your life easier.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good. 

Unlike other companies that are ruining after profits only, SynaBoost has nothing to hide. In fact, it takes pride in this formulation and makes it available to common people. You can even compare these ingredients with other cognitive boosters to see what makes this one better.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

# [Click Here To Visit – “OFFICIAL WEBSITE](https://shorturl.at/uttMm)”✅_

**Bacopa Monnieri**

Bacopa has been a famous name in traditional medicine for many reasons, one of which is its role in cognition. It enhances memory and shortens the attention span and processing of information. It also calms the brain, making stress manageable and less damaging for the body.

**Huperzia Serrata**

Huperzia has many benefits to offer, but its action on neurons is remarkable. T enhances the levels of acetylcholine and makes learning, thinking, and remembering information easier. Further, it lowers the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s in old age.

**Magnesium Stearate**

The last ingredient in this list is magnesium stearate, which acts as a protective barrier for the brain. It prevents damage and injuries, causing a permanent effect. Its benefits include making lifelong memories, helping the brain to think clearly, and removing brain fog.



# Dosage Guidelines

SynaBoost is an easy-to-use capsule that can be swallowed with water. There are 30 pills inside, making 30 doses, so the daily intake should be no more than one capsule. This one capsule is enough to bring the changes in your brain health that you desire. So, there is no need to overdose. 

There is no fixed time to take this supplement, and it can be taken at any hour of the day. For your own convenience, it is better to set a time every day so that the daily dose is never missed. Most people like to take it early in the morning so that they do not miss it if they have a busy day ahead.

It should preferably be used with a large meal. Do not take it in the morning if you are not a breakfast person; instead, take it after any big meal of the day. Never take it with alcohol, only water or juices are the recommended choices to be taken with it. 

If you are already on a medicine or using a supplement, make sure it is not taken with SynaBoost. Or there is a chance of experiencing a cross-reaction with the ingredients. Thus, take one supplement at a time.

# Risks And Safety

SynaBoost is a plant-based Hula; therefore, it has a lower side risk than its chemical alternatives. Since this is an over-the-counter product, you would not require any prescription for it. But, it does not mean that you can ignore the guidelines and dosage while using it. The purpose of taking the supplement is to improve your intelligence, focus, strength, and energy. Using it in the wrong way or changing its dosage can alter these results completely, defying the purpose of using it.

# SynaBoost Ingredients

The ingredients of SynaBoost are shared on the official website. If you are concerned about them, take a look and see if this product is any good. 

Unlike other companies that are ruining after profits only, SynaBoost has nothing to hide. In fact, it takes pride in this formulation and makes it available to common people. You can even compare these ingredients with other cognitive boosters to see what makes this one better.

Following is the list of SynaBoost ingredients and their benefits for the brain and body.

**Green Coffee Bean**

Green coffee beans are loaded with caffeine, which has a natural stimulatory and energy boosting effect. It is in a safe amount so that the users actually receive the benefits and not just a jittery feeling. Caffeine also improves digestion and triggers a natural weight loss in the body, which are just additional benefits of  SynaBoost pills. 

**Theobromine**

It works on boosting energy and building focus by enhancing motor learning in the brain. Its neuroprotective effects can prevent neuronal damage and prevent the previous damage from worsening.

**Rhodiola** Root

Rhodiola root has an antioxidant effect on the body as it lowers oxidative stress, reducing its damage. Quercetin in rhodiola reduces inflammation and also enhances the bioavailability of nutrients in the body. Traditionally, it has been used to enhance cognitive functions, mainly attention span, brain performance, and memory.

**Rice Flour**

Rice is a famous dietary staple, but not many people know that glutinous rice has medicinal benefits, too. The rice flour improves brain flow in the body and brain, controls blood pressure, and lowers lipid levels. It also has a calming effect on the brain by controlling stress levels and reducing impulsive thoughts. 

**L-Tyrosine**

L-tyrosine is an amino acid that expands the natural learning markers. It also saves from degeneration of the brain, causing memory loss, especially in old age. Other benefits include hormonal support due to its helpful role in the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands.

**Bacopa Monnieri**

Bacopa has been a famous name in traditional medicine for many reasons, one of which is its role in cognition. It enhances memory and shortens the attention span and processing of information. It also calms the brain, making stress manageable and less damaging for the body.

**Huperzia Serrata**

Huperzia has many benefits to offer, but its action on neurons is remarkable. T enhances the levels of acetylcholine and makes learning, thinking, and remembering information easier. Further, it lowers the risk of dementia and Alzheimer’s in old age.

**Magnesium Stearate**

The last ingredient in this list is magnesium stearate, which acts as a protective barrier for the brain. It prevents damage and injuries, causing a permanent effect. Its benefits include making lifelong memories, helping the brain to think clearly, and removing brain fog.

since my teenage years, worked on it a lot over years. Not drinking alcohol really, no smoking, even stopped drinking coffee to avoid. I’m quite healthy going to the gym, eating healthy, taking vitamins. So keep my panic attacks under control. After years first time, I had a panic attack at work. I had a discussion with my senior coach, about the workload, told her since 2 weeks I am struggling so much and I do not have enough time to complete all the tasks, but she kept told me things needed to done, I told her that I was aware but workload was intense. However, we ended the call, I tried to focus on work but lost it for a moment, all of a sudden thought about people having heart attacks at work place due to stress. Then boom, I triggered my own gun. I tried to go to the restroom, tried to calm there a bit. Went back to the desk, I just felt like couldn’t breathe at all, quickly informed team I am having panic attack at the moment have to get some air and left the office, I was about to explode. Went to the bathroom, cried 15 mins out of breathe, tried to calm down went outside for a calming tea.

And went back to the office (only to entrance to sit there) My manager called me, he was worried about me, and told me others as well. I told him that I was sorry I didn’t want to leave the desk this way. Tried to explain myself but my body was still under too much tension, I was losing words while speaking, couldn’t even complete a sentence. I feel embarrassed to having to had this.

Not sure how will I look to managers maybe I can’t handle stress well which I normally do but this week was madness. ",1,1728994558.0,Career,1,0.99,False

1g466mt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g466mt,Thursday Boot Co. Black Label - Challengers in Black Teacore Horserump from Maryam Tannery ,"**INTRO**

These are Thursday's take on the PNW boot and I finally got them in yesterday!! I had some shipping delays just like a lot of others with this release but luckily my pair found their way home! I placed my order the morning of the 26th on release but didn't get a proper shipping update until the 10th I believe and that was after some back and forth with customer service. In the end it all worked out and I'm more than pleased with my purchase. These are GORGEOUS boots!!! 

**LEATHER**

I ordered my challengers in the teacore horse rump from Maryam to match my teacore jeans from pure blue japan. The leather is a beautiful oily black over a clean veg tan with slight texture from the grain. No calipers so I can't give a perfect measurement.. But with my tape measure I was able get about 3mm thickness on most parts of the leather. Some spots closer to 2.5mm and some spots closer to 4mm. This is some burly shit. The leather heel stack and welt are dyed and burnished a dark coffee brown for an almost tonal look. One thing I think is cool about the leather is that in direct sunlight they have slight brown tint to them. I'm a big fan of the black/brown combo. They also come with a set of long leather laces, teacore dyed to match, and 2 seperate sets of cord laces (short/long). I can't wait to see how these patina! 

**FIT**

I ordered these in the same size as my 2017 Captains, size 11D. Oh boy, these fit like a dream! Just perfect right out of the box. Foot slid in with little resistance, heel locked in nicely, and toes can wiggle, I'm a happy camper. The full leather and cork insole/shank/midsole is stiff at first but it feels like it should have some give and mold to my foot properly. The chunky lug sole doesn't help with the stiffness but I'm loving how rugged they are. Definitely not a fashion boot. I'm also loving the tall logger heel, helps me feel balanced and stable in my step. The vamp around the forefoot is probably the snuggest part of the boot but I have a high instep so this not unusual for me. Overall I'm so psyched on my pair! Excited to put these to work!

Today I had the ultrasound, and the radiologist said on initial impressions they can't see any obvious signs of gallstones but they would look over the images, form a report and pass onto my doctor.
