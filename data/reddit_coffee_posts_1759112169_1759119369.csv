1nt8gr1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1nt8gr1/anyone_else_get_lazy_with_their_brewing_method/,Anyone else get lazy with their brewing method?,"I decided to see how little I could get away with when using my AeroPress to make my morning coffee and still get a great cup. Here's what I stopped doing: wetting the filter, stirring, blooming, inverting.

I grind my beans (can't remember the grind setting on my 1Zpresso, but it's set for V60 pour over) just before brewing (20g), pour in water just off boiling (my electric kettle doesn't have a temperature setting), and I let it drip through until I get up to 333g of water, add the plunger and wait 2.5 minutes before plunging all the way down through the hissing.

I'm surprised at how robust the AeroPress is with brewing. I get a cup of coffee that's as smooth as my V60 with less hassle. I do use locally roasted single origin coffee though and really good soft water so that probably already makes a huge difference.

Let me know if you've taken any shortcuts or if you've gotten ""lazy"" with your AeroPress brewing. I make my coffee too early in the morning to make it very complicated.",1,1759118797.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

1nt8d3i,https://www.reddit.com/r/witchcraft/comments/1nt8d3i/people_still_talking_about_witches_being_evil/,people still talking about witches being evil,"to preface- i’m from a relatively small town, and the first story i’m going to share is a part of town that is very southern and very religious !

it always takes me aback whenever people say that witches are evil or devil worshippers and like… genuinely mean it. if i share with someone who’s not a close friend about a small ritual i’ve done in casual conversation- 9 times out of 10 i’m met with a concerned- borderline disgusted look.

one time i was walking to get coffee and i was wearing a long black skirt, a sheer-ish top and a black leather trench coat, and tell me why when i went into the coffee shop a kid sitting down legit pointed at me and said to his mom “mom it’s a witch!” i sat at a table close to them after i ordered my coffee and the mom took the boy and left in such a rushed manner i was like girl what the hell im not going to hex your kid i just want a latte

i also work at a bookstore and twice in the past week customers have complained about the witchy things we sell. one customer asked why we sell so many picture books for kids that are about witches (um… maybe cause it’s… i dont know… halloween???), and another customer wouldn’t let their kid get one of these halloween surprise toys we sell because (and i quote) “there might be a witch toy in there and i don’t want y’all playing with that, now put it back.”


i find it fascinating and also disheartening because im not even doing hexes or curses or really any magic involving other people directly. not that i judge those who do, just my personal preference. im just lighting candles and doing fun things with herbs where is the harm in that? anyways im curious to hear what y’all’s experience is with this kind of thing, please share below!",4,1759118478.0,witchcraft,1,1.0,False

I've been using this new method for the past week and I'm wondering how coarse to grind. I've been doing it between click 60 and 75.

I find that different coffees shine on different grind size. I haven't yet tried very light roasts. Most coffees available to me are midium roast.

If you dont hava a K6 maybe you can tell me how many microns the coffee is supposed to be.
The kingrinder i use has 16 microns per click so i guess I've tested so far between 960 and 1500 microns burr opening... (not sure you can compare it with other grinders like that)",1,1759118457.0,OXORapidBrewer,0,1.0,False
1nt8afp,https://i.redd.it/dlosc0zo11sf1.jpeg,Espresso Machine Tools and Coffee Help [Delonghi ECP3630],"First time poster, I read all the instructions so hopefully this doesn't break any guidelines. 

I bought a Delonghi ECP3630 off marketplace for very cheap today. I'm a grad student, so I didn't want to break the bank on one but wanted one to make fancier coffee at home.

A few questions: 
1) the metal cap/wand that goes on top of the milk steamer was missing when I bought it from the previous owner. Do I need one (either from Delonghi or Amazon) to be able to steam milk? I don't have any zip ties on hand so I can't zip tie the silicone wand as I saw in a video online.

2) The filter holder also didn't come with a tamp. Should I buy this off of Delonghi parts (the $8 scoop/tamp) or would Amazon/other work?

3) What are the best and most cost effective coffee grounds to use for this machine? I don't have a grinder yet, are there any suitable grounds/powders that won't break the bank? I don't want to break the machine or use the wrong thing. Would cafe bustelo work with this machine?

Thank you in advance! Please be nice I'm very sensitive :( If you have any tips I will gladly accept them!

Here’s My Take 🌈,"I wanted to share my experience as someone who’s bicurious and figured out how to meet my first girlfriend. Maybe it’ll help anyone else who’s in the same boat.

**1. Explore Yourself First**  
Before diving in, I spent time figuring out what I actually liked and how I felt about women. Journaling and reflecting on my feelings helped a lot.

**2. Connect With People Who Get It**  
I reached out to other bicurious folks online and in LGBTQ+ spaces. It’s nice to talk to people who are exploring too—no pressure, just shared curiosity.

**3. Be Honest**  
I learned early on to be upfront: *“I’m exploring my attraction to women.”* Most people respected that honesty—it made dating way less awkward.

**4. Stick to Your Comfort Zone**  
You don’t have to completely change your life. I met my first girlfriend in places I already liked—coffee shops, events, hobby groups. It felt natural.

**5. Enjoy the Process**  
The goal isn’t “first girlfriend” as a checklist—it’s discovering yourself and connecting with someone you vibe with. The journey itself is part of the fun.

Being bicurious isn’t a problem or a phase—it’s a journey of curiosity and self-discovery. 💖",1,1759117695.0,BiWomenBiMen,0,1.0,False
1nt83z5,https://i.redd.it/eonvn5wnz0sf1.jpeg,"Cold War between Mr. and Mrs Vaughn: He Regretted when Divorce Help me find the novel, please...","On the night of Victoria Sinclair's twenty-sixth birthday, there were no surprises, only shocks.

Surrounded by a few friends, she pushed open the door of the venue. The lighting was dim, and the music was flirtatiously enticing. Several scantily clad girls were striking provocative poses, dancing sultry dances filled with suggestive allure.

It was a scene of absolute decadence, a wild party of drunken revelry and lust.

""Uh...wrong room."" Sarah Lowell linked arms with Victoria Sinclair, ""Victoria, our private room is next door.""

Victoria Sinclair shook off Sarah Lowell's hand, looking seemingly calm at Eugene Vaughn on the sofa, but her heart felt like it was being relentlessly clenched by an invisible hand. Each breath came with a dull pain, making everything before her blur.

Married for two years, she knew he had a lot of scandals and played around, but seeing this intolerable scene with her own eyes, she couldn't help but feel a surge of grief and anger.

Eugene Vaughn saw her too, yet he remained extraordinarily calm, with not a ripple in his eyes or a change in his expression.

Vivian Miller signaled for the provocative dancers to leave, turned off the music, and stood up from beside Eugene Vaughn, ""Sister-in-law, don't misunderstand, we're just fooling around.""

""Sister-in-law?"" The two men beside them had long heard of Victoria Sinclair, looked nervously at Eugene Vaughn, and then at Victoria Sinclair, ""Sister-in-law, it's really not what you think.""

Eugene Vaughn ignored her and continued drinking.

Vivian Miller complained, ""Sister-in-law, we brothers were just watching a show, and with me here, they wouldn't dare take these girls to a room. You wouldn't get angry with Eugene over something so trivial, would you?""

Hearing this, Victoria Sinclair looked at Vivian Miller.

A reasonably pretty woman, she had grown up with Eugene Vaughn, calling each other brother and sister.

She hadn't said a word from the beginning, so where did the anger come from?

This woman sure knew how to play things.

""Sorry for the intrusion."" Victoria Sinclair forced back her bitterness, turned around, and left.

In the hallway, several friends were indignant.

Sarah Lowell grabbed her, ""Victoria, our room is ahead. Where are you going?""

Victoria Sinclair halted, looked at Sarah Lowell, ""Let's unfriend each other, and don't keep in touch anymore.""

The others were stunned.

Sarah Lowell was shocked, her eyes wide as saucers, ""Victoria Sinclair, are you out of your mind? Your husband fools around, what's it got to do with me? We've been best friends for so many years, and you want to break up with me over a jerk?""

Forcing a birthday party on her, and bringing her to a place she disliked the most, how could it have nothing to do with her?

Victoria Sinclair suppressed her fury with all her strength, ""What did Vivian Miller offer you?""

Sarah Lowell paused, her eyes flickering, ""I...""

Victoria Sinclair didn't give her a chance to explain, ""I've been married to Eugene Vaughn for two years. I know what kind of man he is. I'm not an idiot. I don't need you and Vivian Miller setting up traps to push us to divorce.""

Sarah Lowell's eyes darted around, her fingertips quivering as she reached for Victoria Sinclair, ""Victoria, I just...didn't want you to be deceived by him anymore.""

Victoria Sinclair evaded her touch, ""This is where it ends for us.""

She didn't need a toxic friend willing to betray her for benefits at any moment.

Victoria Sinclair briskly left the place that made her nauseous.

Sarah Lowell was surrounded and questioned by the other friends.

""Today's Victoria's birthday, what the hell are you doing?""

""Did you really take advantages from that pick-me girl?""

""Sarah Lowell, is this the surprise you arranged for Victoria?""

——

The room filled with the aroma of alcohol was exceptionally quiet.

A hard-to-describe oppressive atmosphere loomed, and no one dared to speak.

Eugene Vaughn downed several shots of strong liquor, lazily collapsed against the sofa back, eyes sharp, impatiently tugging at his tie, realizing the blindfold was still hanging around his neck, annoyed, he yanked it off.

He tore the blindfold off, throwing it harshly onto the table, then took off his suit jacket and tie, slowly unbuttoning his white dress shirt.

Vivian Miller crossed her arms angrily, leaned back next to him, and complained, ""Are all women so petty? Just watching a show, and she gets mad? I really don't enjoy playing with women, it's no fun.""

Charlie Spencer filled Eugene Vaughn's empty glass, ""Have a drink, don't kill the mood.""

Eugene Vaughn leaned over, picked up the glass, and downed it in one go.

As the strong liquor burned down his throat, he asked casually, ""Who set this up?""

Everyone froze.

""We didn't set anything up."" Vivian Miller nervously said, ""It was a coincidence.""

Eugene Vaughn sneered coldly, lifted his eyelids to glance at Vivian Miller, and pointed to the door Victoria Sinclair left through, ""Who is she?""

Vivian Miller's anxious eyes darted to the other brothers, seeking help.

Eugene Vaughn harshly repeated, ""I'm asking you, who is she?""

Of course, Vivian Miller knew who she was.

She was Victoria Sinclair, Eugene Vaughn's secretly cherished untouchable taboo, the line he wouldn't allow anyone to cross.

""Victoria Sinclair."" Vivian Miller answered timidly.

Eugene Vaughn laughed cynically.

Yes! She was Victoria Sinclair!

Everyone present knew what the name Victoria Sinclair signified.

Eugene Vaughn stated word by word, ""She's not supposed to appear in such places.""

Vivian Miller muttered in displeasure, ""Who says pharmaceutical scientists can't come to places like this?""

Eugene Vaughn bent down, elbows resting on his knees, head lowering, his voice turned cold, ""Making this dirty, is it fun?""

Charlie Spencer noticed Vivian Miller's fearful expression and loyally took the blame for her, ""Eugene, I was the one who called the dancing girls, and I was the one who tricked sister-in-law into coming. I just wanted to test if sister-in-law still had feelings for you.""

Eugene Vaughn raised his head, and his chillingly sharp gaze pierced into Charlie Spencer.

Charlie Spencer swallowed nervously, his back stiffening.

——

Victoria Sinclair was sleepless.

In the early morning, unable to sleep, she went to the kitchen, poured herself a glass of milk from the fridge, warmed it up, and sat on the living room sofa sipping it.

The night breeze gently wafted into the living room, swaying the light sheer curtains. The city lights were brighter than the night itself.

A quiet stillness.

She wrapped both hands around the warm milk, taking small sips, unable to calm her heart.

A soft click sounded.

Victoria Sinclair turned her head towards the door.

The door opened, Eugene Vaughn walked in, changing into slippers at the entrance.

He glanced at the brightly lit living room, momentarily dazed, his gaze landing on Victoria Sinclair.

Victoria Sinclair usually went to bed early; tonight was an exception.

She glanced at Eugene Vaughn, then drank the remaining milk in one gulp, went into the kitchen, washed the glass, and came out, switching off the lights.

Eugene Vaughn sprawled out on the sofa, sitting with a bold posture, head tilted back against the sofa back. Whether he drank too much or was overly tired, he remained motionless with his eyes closed.

Victoria Sinclair quietly walked past him.

""Were you waiting for me?"" His voice cool and low.

Victoria Sinclair stopped, her back to him, something heavy blocking her chest.

She exhaled lightly, ""No.""

""Seeing your husband fooling around outside, don't you have anything to say?""

His words felt like needles piercing Victoria Sinclair's heart, a sharp, painful sensation.

However, she was used to burying her grievances deep inside.

Victoria Sinclair remained silent for a few painfully long seconds, the air seemed to freeze.

Finally, she feigned magnanimity, speaking calmly, ""Be hygienic, take care of yourself.""

Those words broke Eugene Vaughn completely.

He got up from the sofa, rushed to her, grabbed her wrist fiercely.

Victoria Sinclair was caught off guard, spun around, pain radiating from her wrist.

She panicked, tears welling in her eyes, ""Eugene Vaughn, what are you doing?""

...

Eugene Vaughn pushed her against the wall with such force that her back ached.

He was tall, his strong physique to Victoria Sinclair was like an insurmountable mountain.

Her wrists were pinned above her head against the wall by one of Eugene's hands, unable to move.

Eugene leaned down, looked her in the eyes coldly, and used his other hand to grasp her jaw, tilting her face upwards.

Victoria's heart raced, her breath filled with a faint smell of alcohol from the man's body, her cheeks hurting from the grip, as she stared at him in fear and anxiety.

This was the first time in two years she was so close to Eugene, seeing so clearly his thick brows, deep phoenix eyes, high nose bridge, and pale thin lips.

His exquisite features were very handsome, and the faint tear mole at the corner of his eye was particularly alluring.

But the dangerous and powerful aura around him made her unable to breathe.

He had never touched her before, not even the slightest physical contact.

Victoria swallowed nervously, her voice trembling slightly, ""Are you drunk?""

Eugene was icy cold, his voice squeezed from his chest like gravel, ""Victoria Sinclair, do you know you are truly disgusting?""

Victoria felt a sharp pain in her heart, her eyes moistening.

Of course, she knew.

If he didn't dislike her, why would he be unwilling to touch her after two years of marriage?

Victoria held back the tears in her eyes, striving to keep her voice calm, ""Eugene, if you want to continue, then continue. If you don't, then let's divorce. You don't need to force yourself.""

Eugene laughed coldly, his fingers tightening slightly, making her jaw ache, ""Force myself? You're gorgeous, nice to look at at home. You don't waste my money and you do housework, saving me a lot on nanny fees.""

His words were like sharp blades, stabbing into her heart, leaving her almost breathless with pain.

""Why, exactly?"" Victoria's hands shook in anger, powerless to break free from his grip, her voice choked slightly, yet stubbornly refusing to allow tears to overflow.

They met through a matchmaking.

Her parents had been pushing for marriage since she was twenty, just to take her dowry back to their hometown to build a house.

Their incessant calls urging her to marry tortured her for four years, until she couldn't withstand the pressure any longer and agreed to meet someone at twenty-four.

Eugene was introduced to her by her college professor.

He was a year older than her, a distinguished scion, heir to the Vaughn Group, tall and strong, handsome and elegant, the perfect wealthy and handsome man.

Initially, Eugene treated her with utmost kindness, gentle and considerate, deeply passionate.

She wanted to avoid any mother-in-law conflict and hoped to live separately after marriage.

Eugene bought a 200-square-meter apartment near her workplace's research institute.

She didn't like being in crowded places, especially with strangers in her home.

Eugene dismissed the maid and part-time workers and shared housework with her.

She had her own career and dreams and didn't want to become a housewife after marriage.

Eugene respected her immensely, never asking her to resign.

She had never been in a relationship, was traditional and conservative.

Eugene's feelings were restrained yet courteous, gentlemanly and polite.

Though she wasn't skilled in expressing love, she truly fell for this exceedingly wonderful man, inescapably.

In just a few months of dating, she eagerly accepted Eugene's romantic proposal.

After marriage, everything changed.

She didn't know why, Eugene seemed to have become someone else, extremely distant and indifferent towards her.

During two years of marriage, they were more like familiar yet estranged roommates rather than spouses.

This kind of relationship made Victoria very unhappy, unsure of how much longer she could endure.

She could only convince herself to not fuss, to look at marriage and love lightly, and just get by.

Spilt water cannot be retrieved, nor can true affection.

Falling for the wrong person is torturous, she lacked the strength to love someone else anymore.

Eugene's gaze was as deep as a stagnant pool, staring fixedly at her face reddened by anger, his voice hoarse, ""Victoria Sinclair, no reason, just purely annoyed by your indifferent attitude, always with a cold face, like bland water, boring and tasteless.""

Victoria's vision blurred with tears, the deepest part of her heart throbbing in pain, unable to withstand his verbal attacks anymore.

For the first time in two years, she lashed out at him.

""Then why did you marry me?"" Her voice raised a few levels, suppressed anger and grievance erupted, ""Are you a masochist?""

Eugene's lips curled into a cold smile, his gaze still fixed on her face, silent for a few seconds before releasing her and taking a step back, suddenly whispering, ""Yes, a masochist.""

Victoria didn't expect such a reaction from him, rubbed her aching wrist, suppressed her tears, and turned to enter the room.

Closing the door, her body felt limp and weak, leaning against the door, tears quietly welled up, large, cool drops sliding down her cheeks, dripping onto her chin.

Victoria lay awake all night, only dozing off in exhaustion as dawn approached.

She slept for only four hours, waking at nine in the morning.

She got up, washed, and dressed.

Placed the dirty clothes in the washing machine to wash and dry.

She also casually pressed the auto button on the floor sweeper, and the flat round robot started cleaning the floor.

Sunlight streamed through the glass windows of the balcony into the spacious living room, warm yet unable to penetrate her cold heart.

She routinely made two breakfasts, today it was tomato and egg noodles.

She calmly sat at the dining table, chewing mechanically.

Suddenly, the doorbell rang.

She set down her chopsticks and went to open the door.

Seeing the woman standing outside, Victoria's eyes dimmed slightly, her already depressed mood sinking further.

""Good morning, sister-in-law."" Vivian Miller smiled warmly, extending a large brown paper bag, ""The air conditioning at the club was too cold last night, Eugene gave me his jacket to wear, and I happened to pass by here, so I came to return it.""

Victoria didn't take it, ""No need to return it, he's a neat freak, he won't use something once others have touched it.""

Vivian chuckled awkwardly and, uninvited, directly walked past Victoria into the house, her black high heels clicking crisply on the clean floor, loudly declaring her presence.

""Sister-in-law, Eugene's only a neat freak about you, right? We grew up together, wore the same clothes, ate from the same bowl, drank from the same cup of coffee, I never knew he had a cleanliness fetish.""

Only for her? Clean freak?

Victoria stood motionless, her body rigid, feeling as if a string in her heart suddenly snapped quietly, making her chest swell with pain.

Two winters ago, she was reading in the living room, and because it was too cold, she casually picked up Eugene's windbreaker draped over the sofa to put on.

When she returned it to him, he said, ""I'm a neat freak, throw it away.""

She thought Eugene didn't like others using his things.

Turns out, he was simply repulsed by her.

How ridiculous!

Victoria couldn't laugh, she shut the door, her heart heavy, her stomach spasming, losing her appetite for breakfast.

She picked up her bowl and chopsticks from the dining table, went into the kitchen, and emptied them.

Vivian wandered around the house, eventually coming to lean at the kitchen door, ""Sister-in-law, where's Eugene's room?""

Victoria washed the dishes, ""Leave the clothes on the sofa, he drank too much last night and won't be up early.""

Vivian laughed lightly, her tone carrying a hint of sarcasm, ""I slept in the same bed with Eugene lots of times before, we're close like brothers, zero barriers.""

Victoria paused her dishwashing, gripping the sponge tightly, her knuckles faintly exerting force.

Vivian's voice rang again, openly arrogant, ""Sister-in-law, I just toured your house, peeked into your room, turns out you and Eugene sleep separately, huh?""

Victoria threw the sponge into the sink with a sharp clatter of the dishes.

She washed her hands, turned off the tap, and coldly walked past Vivian, grabbed her bag from the sofa, slipped into her casual canvas shoes, and left the house without saying a word.

Seeing Victoria storm out angrily, Vivian's smile grew even more triumphant, arms crossed, wandering around the living room, gazing here and there, touching this and that.

Finally, she twisted open Eugene's room door and walked inside.

...

Vivian Miller walked into Eugene Vaughn's room and pulled open the curtains.

Bright, dazzling light filled the clean and tidy room.

On the light gray two-meter bed, Eugene slept in an upright position, his brows knitting tightly from the sudden brightness.

Vivian Miller walked over and knelt by his bedside.

His body stiffened slightly, and his steady breathing gradually became rapid.

Although his eyes were closed, he was already awake,

Vivian Miller leaned closer, her fingertips slowly tracing down his handsome, high-bridged nose.

Eugene suddenly raised his hand, grabbing hold of the restless finger.

His eyes remained shut, his chest rising and falling intensely.

Vivian Miller tried to pull her finger away, but Eugene held it firmly, showing no intent to release it.

His unusual action made Vivian's face instantly redden, feeling both elated and shy, ""Eugene, wake up.""

Hearing her voice, Eugene frowned tightly and opened his eyes.

At the moment his eyes met Vivian's, his pupils contracted sharply, as if burnt, and he quickly let go of her hand.

Sitting up straight, the silky gray duvet fell to his waist, with a slight disappointment from the misunderstanding, ""Why are you here?""

Vivian knew he had a cleanliness obsession and quickly left his bed, ""Last night, your jacket was left at the club, so I dropped by to bring it.""

Eugene lowered his head, tousling his jet-black short hair, ""Take it, throw it away.""

He seemed to have lost his mind, actually imagined it was Victoria Sinclair entering his room and secretly touching his nose.

Vivian was quite puzzled, ""No one wore it. It's such an expensive piece of clothing, why throw it away?""

Last night, he was blindfolded and taken to a private club room. When he tore off the cloth, a dancer was circling around, touching him and wearing a fragrant perfume that made him nauseous. He hadn't reacted when he was pushed onto a couch, and at the same time, Victoria burst in with her friends, causing last night's misunderstanding.

Eugene didn't plan to explain to Vivian, asking impatiently in a cold tone, ""Remember what I told you all?""

Of course, Vivian remembered that prior to Eugene's wedding, he specifically instructed all his brothers not to visit his home without his invitation.

""I remember.""

""Why did you still come up?"" Eugene picked up his phone from the bedside table, glancing at the normal signal, ""Can't you call if there's something?""

Vivian felt increasingly guilty, knowing that Eugene was extremely astute and her little tricks were futile against him.

""I was just curious and wanted to look at your house.""

Eugene paused for a moment, lifted the duvet and got out of bed, silently passing her and walking out of the room.

Vivian followed behind him.

Eugene walked straight to the living room door, pulling it open with one hand.

His indifferent attitude was very clear.

Vivian pouted, standing still.

""What you shouldn't see, you've probably already seen. Your curiosity is satisfied, now you can leave.""

""I haven't even had a sip of water, is this how you treat your guests?""

""Downstairs, turn left to the café, drink as much as you want, send me the bill."" Eugene's eyes darkened a bit, speaking with a slight impatience, ""If there's a next time, I'll throw you off the balcony.""

Though childhood sweethearts, Vivian dared not challenge Eugene's authority with her whims. She walked out, and as she turned, the door was already closed.

Eugene entered the kitchen, poured a cup of ice water from the fridge, and took a sip, the coldness piercing to his core.

He held the water, one hand in his pocket, standing by the balcony next to the dining table, gazing at the distant view outside the window.

The morning light was faint, the sky clean and bright as if washed.

The warm light lit up his handsome profile, casting a hint of melancholy through the softness.

He turned back, his eyes falling on the dining table.

Under the transparent cover were two deep bowls, the soup and tomato egg noodles separated, with a pair of chopsticks placed on a clean napkin.

His gaze dimmed, turning his face back to the window, gulping down the water in the cup.

Inside the house, the robotic vacuum cleaner rotated silently and routinely.

The washing machine was also running quietly.

Everything seemed exceptionally cold and still, like a dead pond.

——

A ten-minute walk, Victoria Sinclair had just entered the pharmaceutical laboratory when she ran into Angela Austin rushing out with a panicked look.

""Victoria, just in time, experiment monkey number 9 is dead.""

Victoria quickened her pace, entered the office, dropped her bag, and slipped on her lab coat while heading towards the lab.

Angela followed closely, voice urgent, ""All indicators were fine last night, didn't expect it'd be gone by morning.""

""The new drug still has toxins."" Victoria summarized while buttoning up as she walked.

""Sarah Lowell…"" Angela tried to mend the relationship with Sarah Lowell, after all, the three of them had been roommates for four years at university, building a deep friendship, not wanting it to just break apart like this.

Victoria interrupted, ""Don't mention her.""

""Then you and Eugene…""

""Angela, during work time, I don't want to talk about personal matters.""

Angela resigned, ""Alright, let's talk business then. Our company's running out of funds, the new project is also close to a halt, can't you ask your incredibly wealthy husband to invest a little bit?""

Speaking of their pharmaceutical company, it was pitifully small.

Only four people in total, one market sales representative, one financial officer, Angela, in name as the manager, but actually doing assistant work, while Victoria Sinclair was the company's legal representative and also the drug developer.

Victoria had been the good child in everyone's eyes since childhood, obedient and smart as a whip.

During school years, she was the most dazzling yet unreachable star, excelled in academics, and was beautiful as well.

She studied pharmacology, researching rare disease drugs since college, and currently held two drug patents.

The money she earned from patents funded her pharmaceutical company, renting this not-so-large laboratory to continue fueling her dream.

Victoria stepped into the lab, examining the corpse of the monkey on the mat, casually responding to Angela, ""Anyone but him can be asked for investment.""

Angela put her hands on her hips, ""If you keep going like this, you won't even be able to pay the salesperson's salary.""

""If worse comes to worst, I'll get a part-time teaching job at the medical school, earn some extra cash to pay the salesperson.""

Angela raised an eyebrow, ""And what about my salary?""

Victoria looked up at her, smiling sweetly, ""Give you my hand in marriage?""

Angela finally saw a smile on Victoria's gloomy face, releasing the tension she had held, ""I'll take that offer.""

Evening.

The city lights came on, the neon lights dazzling and brilliant.

A slight drizzle was falling from the sky.

After work, Victoria stopped by the supermarket, bought groceries, and returned home to make a solitary dinner.

After dinner, she read for a while, then washed up and went to bed at ten o'clock sharp.

Their schedules rarely overlapped.

When she slept, Eugene hadn't come home. When she got up for work, Eugene was still asleep.

If it was a day off, they would occasionally encounter each other, yet avoid each other to not feel uneasy.

Victoria hadn't been lying down long before she was asleep, when she heard her phone ringing in a daze.

She groped for her phone, sleepily looking at the screen.

Seeing Eugene Vaughn's name instantly brought her to full attention, sitting up quickly.

In the two years of marriage, that number never rang on her phone again.

So abrupt, she felt somewhat anxious.

Living under the same roof, calling her at eleven at night was indeed unusual, she took a deep breath, answered and put it to her ear, speaking in a gentle tone, ""What's up?""

On the other end, Eugene's deep voice was wrapped in grief, ""Grandfather passed away, pack your things, I'll come to get you.",1,1759117652.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

I had been complaining since we only drove SUV's.  I'm in heaven.  When we pulled up to the dealer I reminded my husband that when we bought his current car I was taking ally for weight loss.  A side effect was oily stool and leakage.  He recalled I had an accident on the passenger seat and we laughed and laughed.

This morning I'm 100% happy to run to Starbucks for coffee.  I get about 2/3 of the way there and the F-ing lactulose hits me.  I stave it off and all is well.  I'm in line at the drive thru and it hits me again.  Even worse then the 1st time.  I'm having a fit.  I am not going to shit in my brand new car!!!

I get the dagumm coffee.  I'm sweating like Jessica Simpson on are you smarter then a 4th grader.  I refuse to use the toilet in Starbucks.  They all know me.  I'm heading home.  It subsides.

Goldman Sachs is reorganizing engineering around task-level automation and internal copilots; Walmart is promising reskilling while quietly pruning corporate ranks. Translation for founders, indie hackers and skeptical consultants: the market is already optimizing tasks, not jobs.

The PR line is “augmentation.” The internal deck reads “productivity per head.” That tension matters. When leadership says ‘we’ll retrain people,’ they mean the ones whose jobs involve repeatable, high-volume tasks that can be described, measured, and shipped as a workflow. The rest get a polite out. Companies like Goldman are building platform teams, embedding role-specific copilots, and selectively hiring senior AI talent — not to replace the human entirely, but to capture output per engineer.

Retailers are the stress test. Walmart’s training academies and coaching programs are real, but so are the restructuring memos. Reskilling is only as good as the deployment pipeline: teach people new skills, then give them a job where those skills matter. Too often the “reskill” checkbox exists without the “redeploy” box being ticked.

What should you — the founder, the indie hacker, the consultant who drinks IPO-grade coffee — do about it? First, map work to tasks. Stop thinking headcount-first; think task-level flow. Build copilots or automations that remove the 20% of work that takes 80% of time. Second, reorganize engineering around a platform + domain play: platform for models, data, safety; domain squads for product and deployment. Third, hire senior AI ops and MLOps folks sparingly and put most investment into upskilling adjacent talent.

The cynical oracle take: companies will keep saying ‘human-centric’ until the metric spreadsheet says otherwise. Layoffs will be dressed as “optimizations.” Founders, this is your moment — either build tools that slice tasks into deployable copilots, or become the tool someone uses to make your job disappear.

Last, if you’re a consultant pitching “AI transformation,” start with ROI on a single repetitive workflow. Prove a 10–30% uplift in throughput and you get to use the buzzwords. Fail, and you become a cautionary tale about optimism without runway. Meme it, ship it, or get out of the way.",1,1759117402.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

So when I turned 18 my body could no longer handle milk products properly and I'd have gas and diarrhea. However as time went on it got worse. I never really stopped consuming milk products over the last 8 years, as I just dealt with it as I love cheese. That being said within the last year it has gotten to the point where if I consume too much dairy, it will cause bloody stools in addition to the gas and diarrhea. Not just from wiping too much either, but like worrying levels of blood. Obviously I have pretty much stopped my dairy intake.

However my main issue is, is this Lactose intolerance, or a form of milk allergy? Obviously no one here can diagnose me, but I have taken lactose pills, enzymes, and consumed lactose free milk and products and it still gives me problems, whereas my father who is also lactose intolerant, it causes him no issues. So it isn't the lactose, but perhaps my body is allergic to or averse to milk proteins? For example, I have consumed ""dairy free"" coffee creamer and it causes the same issues as it usually still contains whey or casein, which is beyond frustrating since I like cream in my coffee.

Their usernames had collided in a chat, where memes and laughter drowned out the silence of their separate bedrooms.

Robert was quiet at first, more of a listener, but Hizzle had this energy about him—like a spark on a dark screen—that pulled Robert in. What started as casual larping sessions turned into hours of conversation about everything: music, bad cafeteria food, the strange ache of growing up, and dreams too big to say out loud anywhere else.

Months went by. They were inseparable online. Hizzle would tease Robert about his “serious voice,” while Robert would pretend to be annoyed, secretly smiling at his phone. One night, Hizzle typed, almost offhand:

“I kinda wish we could hang out in person. Like… actually.”

Robert froze, rereading the message until the words blurred. His heart thudded in a way that told him this was more than friendship.

A few weeks later, Robert was standing nervously outside a coffee shop, hands buried in his hoodie pocket. The door creaked open, and there was Hizzle—real, smiling, and every bit as magnetic as he’d been through a headset.

“Robert?” Hizzle asked, stepping closer.

“Yeah. You’re taller than your profile picture made you look.”

They both laughed, the tension melting away.

The hours slipped by as they wandered the city together, swapping stories they already knew but needed to hear face-to-face. As the evening cooled, they sat side by side on a park bench, lights twinkling above them.

Robert’s hand brushed against Hizzle’s. He hesitated, but Hizzle didn’t pull away. Instead, he laced their fingers together—like it was the most natural thing in the world.

“I’ve been waiting to do that,” Hizzle whispered.

Robert’s chest tightened, but in the best way. He leaned closer, until the only thing between them was courage. And when their lips finally met, it wasn’t fireworks or explosions—it was something softer. Like coming home after being lost for a long time.

I started this because I’ve always found money apps either too complex or too clunky, and I wanted something that just works seamlessly.   
  
With Spenzy you can:   
• Track expenses in the way that works best for you (manually, typing with AI, or snapping receipts with AI)   
• Set budgets that actually help you avoid overspending   
• Split bills easily when you’re out with friends   
• Use multiple wallets and currencies (great for trips or business expenses)   
• Snap receipts and export them later for reimbursements

  * Platform & Technical Fluency: Comfortable working in deeply technical domains; able to partner with engineering on tradeoffs, APIs, data models, system integrations, and platform architecture.
  * Strategic Thinking & Roadmap Execution: Experience defining long-term platform strategy and roadmaps, balancing technical complexity, business impact, and scalability; proven track record of negotiating tradeoffs and delivering end-to-end execution.
  * Cross-Functional Collaboration & Influence: Able to work effectively with Engineering, Product, Design, Data Science, Finance, Compliance, and external partners; experienced in managing and influencing multiple stakeholders to achieve alignment and business outcomes.
  * Customer-Centric UX Ownership: Opinionated about how invoicing data (totals, discounts, fees, taxes) is displayed across customer-facing surfaces; able to safeguard clarity, transparency, and trust for our customers while collaborating with surface-owning teams.

1nt7sdh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1nt7sdh/legs_suddenly_started_jerkingtwitching_and_its/,Legs suddenly started jerking/twitching and it's getting worse,"Hi! So about 6 months ago, I (27F, 4'11, 96 lbs) started to notice my legs sort of randomly jerking/kicking lightly while I am laying down or sitting.

Since then, it seems to happen more and more often. It happens in both legs, and my lower back as well (like my waist randomly kinda twisting slightly). Now, if I am laying down or sitting, I will notice my legs suddenly jerking slightly several times per hour, sometimes even multiple times in a few minutes.

It doesn't affect my quality of life or anything and I wouldn't normally find something like this concerning, except that it seemed to start out of nowhere and it seems to be getting worse pretty quickly.

Possibly related, shortly after it started, someone I shared a room with told me that I ""twitch in my sleep like a dog chasing a squirrel in its dreams"", which I had never heard about myself before.

*Some details:*

-It does not hurt

-It seems to be worse (more often / bigger twitches) when I lay down shortly after exercise, but it happens even when I am just chilling on the couch or going to sleep

-I take Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Tri-Sprintec, Claritin, and Vitamin D supplements. The Wellbutrin does cause hand tremors, but nothing like this before

-I don't have any neurological issues (that I know of), but I do have convulsive syncopes that have been mistaken for seizures

-I rarely drink coffee or consume any caffeine (I am very sensitive to it)

-I have also been dealing with unexplained daytime sleepiness for several years and will be getting a sleep study done next month

I don't think this is RLS because I don't feel any discomfort or need to move; it just happens on its own. I am planning to bring it up in January at my yearly checkup, but since it seems to be getting worse so quickly I am wondering if I should see someone sooner. Is this a normal part of aging, or could this be an early sign of a nervous system disorder?

Thanks in advance!",2,1759116621.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

1nt7qvx,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nt7qvx,Vegan brownie,"Today I'm bringing you a vegan brownie recipe. It's super easy to make, affordable, has a unique flavor, is delicious, and is gluten-free for those with gluten intolerances—perfect for any snack.



# THE RECIPE

  
**Time, ingredients and equipment**



* Preparation time: If you have all the ingredients, it takes between 5 and 10 minutes to mix, let this mixture rest for 30 more minutes, and then a baking period of 45-50 minutes, depending on the oven, in total It would be approximately 90 minutes. I recommend letting this dessert sit overnight to allow its flavors to settle and blend, making it possible for them to be better enjoyed.

* Servings: Approximately 6 servings of 100 grams each.

**The amounts of ingredients that I present below may vary according to the taste and availability of each one of you.**

* 120 grams of cocoa powder (bitter).
* 50 grams of nuts, you can add more, and even use peanuts, cashews, hazelnuts, almonds, whatever you have available.
* 250 grams of ripe bananas, the more ripe the better, because they sweeten more.
* 80 grams of coconut flour or desiccated coconut.
* 240 grams of oat flour.
* 200 ml of syrup, although you can use 150 grams of white or brown sugar, or the same 200 ml of molasses or 200 grams of ground or grated cane sugar.
* 100 ml of vegetable milk, I used a kind of coconut water (although it wasn't just water, it had other components), which I had left over from the coconut oil preparation.
* 50 cc of neutral vegetable oil, I used olive oil, but corn, soybean, etc., whatever you have at home, will do.
* Bowls, knife, baking pan, oven, blender or processor, teaspoons, measuring cups, etc.

  
**THE PROCEDURE**

  
We start by slicing and mashing the bananas in a bowl. Later we add the cocoa powder little by little, while stirring until they are well integrated.

  
Then add the syrup or sweetener, mix well. Next we add the vegetable milk, stirring to mix correctly.

  
The next step is to add the vegetable oil and mix. Separately, chop the walnuts finely and sprinkle with oatmeal.

  
Then we progressively incorporate the oat flour, and then the coconut flour or dehydrated coconut. Mix well. Finally, add the walnuts, mix and let stand for half an hour, so that the flours hydrate

  
Oil a baking pan and sprinkle with oat flour. The mixture is poured there, sprinkle with dehydrated coconut on top, and placed in a preheated oven at 180 ºC, for a period of time between 45 and 55 minutes, depending on the oven. You will know when it is ready, when you insert a knife and it comes out clean.

  
Remove from the oven and let it cool to room temperature, so you can cut it later, but as I suggested at the beginning, it is better to let it rest until the next day or about 12 hours, so that the flavors blend and express themselves better. You can eat this brownie on its own, just like I did, or you can accompany it with coffee or juice, or even a glass of non-dairy milk. Delicious!

1nt7qrl,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nt7qrl/espresso_machine_vs_french_press_whats_the/,Espresso machine vs French press: what's the difference?,"Hey coffee enthusiasts! I've been a barista for over 8 years, and I constantly get asked about the difference between espresso machines and French presses. After experimenting with both brewing methods at home and at work, I thought I'd share my insights.

Let's start with espresso machines. These are basically the powerhouses of coffee brewing. They force hot water through finely-ground coffee beans at high pressure, creating that intense, concentrated shot we all love. The result? A rich, creamy layer of crema on top and a bold flavor that packs a serious punch.

I recently upgraded my home setup with a new espresso machine (you can check it out here: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine), and it's been a game-changer. The consistency and quality are just unmatched.

Now, French presses are a whole different ball game. They're simple, straightforward, and honestly pretty foolproof. You just steep coarse coffee grounds in hot water and press down the plunger to filter them out. The coffee comes out full-bodied with more natural oils, giving you a different kind of richness.

Here's what I've noticed about the key differences:

1. Prep time: French press takes about 4-5 minutes to brew, while espresso machines can give you that caffeine fix in under a minute.

2. Maintenance: French presses are super easy to clean, while espresso machines need regular cleaning and descaling.

3. Cost: French presses are budget-friendly, but quality espresso machines (like this one: https://athometouch.com/espresso-machine) are an investment that pays off if you're serious about your coffee.

4. Versatility: Espresso machines let you make lattes, cappuccinos, and other fancy drinks. French presses are pretty much one-trick ponies.

5. Taste: Espresso is concentrated and intense, while French press coffee is smoother and more traditional.

In my opinion, if you're a casual coffee drinker who enjoys a traditional cup, go for the French press. But if you're like me and love experimenting with different coffee drinks or need that perfect morning shot of espresso, an espresso machine is worth every penny.

Both methods have their place in a coffee lover's kitchen. I actually use both depending on my mood and how much time I have. The French press is perfect for lazy Sunday mornings, while my espresso machine is my go-to for quick morning fixes and when friends come over for cappuccinos.

Anyone else here use both methods? I'd love to hear about your experiences!",1,1759116477.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False
1nt7qjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1nt7qjt/when_you_shoot_your_shot_and_it_bounces_off_the/,When you shoot your shot… and it bounces off the group chat 😭,"I finally had the courage to ask this guy out. He’s only here for a quick vacay (about a week left), but we’ve been talking for months and even have inside jokes. One of them is that he “owes me coffee.”

A few nights ago, he sent me a video of him having dinner with his friends. I jokingly said, “Where’s mine?” and he replied, “Show up.” The next day, when I went out with my own friends, I flipped it back on him and said “show up.” He said he already had plans but mentioned he’d be watching a game the next day and going for a run — and that I could bring my friends if I wanted.

Fast forward to the next day, I finally asked him straight up if he wanted to grab coffee with me. His response?

* “I’ll go on a trip tomorrow.”
* “But I’ll ask my friends if they want to go either Tues or Wed.”
* “I’ll just hit you up if we’re going.”

Like…??? Bro. I didn’t ask your friends, I asked you. 😭

So now I’m stuck wondering: is this just him dodging without saying no, or is he actually interested but only in group hangouts? We’ve built up rapport, jokes, and history, so the way he worded it felt like a deflection.

Would you read this as “not interested,” or is he just bad at handling one-on-one invites?",1,1759116459.0,dating_advice,7,1.0,False

I followed the calibration steps, but every attempt resulted in the same issue. The weight does not remain stable—it changes continuously, and even with nothing on the scale, it shifts from 0 to -3.

During one calibration attempt, I left the 100 g weight on the scale and saw it fluctuate from 100.3 g down to 97.9 g.

All tests were done on my kitchen counter, with no other devices running or windows open that could cause these slight changes.

Chapter 1: The Heartache

Rooms open: Hotel rooms, diner, pool, bathhouse, laundromat, gift shop

1st motive: Characters have 48 hours to kill someone, or else the person they are close to the most will be killed off.

Victims: >!Antonio (stabbed by scissors !<twice) and Min-seo (hit in the head twice by a hammer)

Blackened: >!Hajime (Akira is held hostage by a gang, and Hajime fights the leader. Hajime then frees Akira, but is killed by the gang Hajime fought in front of Akira, severely traumatizing Akira. This reflects how Hajime angered some gangs by killing off the leader's wife.)!<

Twist: >!Akira attacked Antonio and Min-seo, and Antonio began writing ""fox"" on the wall, but once Hajime stabbed him again to save Akira, Antonio crossed out the word ""fox"".!<

Final line: >!""I would do it again if we were in any different situation, Aki. After all..... the oldest must do whatever they can to save their little siblings. Stay  strong for me, okay? And tell Hana and Kokoro I love them for me.""!<

Chapter 2: Once Upon A Scream

Rooms unlocked: Spa, Garden

2nd motive: Each player has been randomly given someone else's secret. By 72 hours, the secrets will be exposed, but not who the secret belongs to.

Victim: >!Wei (drowned in a pond in the garden, with two cuts on his wrist and two stabs on his calves)!<

Culprit: >!Ivan (Ivan is pulled to a room, where he catches a weight, and is forced to hold onto it. Over time, more weight gets added, and every time another weight gets added, he gets a single cut on his thighs, eventually his arms give out and Ivan is crushed to death by the weights. Looks like that one duel minigame from Mario Party 5. This reflects how Ivan has a secret soft side he never shows because he was pressured by his father and grandfather to always be tough and strong, and rules they forced onto him since they were the rules they grew up with.)!<

Twist: >!Akira was the traitor, since his cat, Kokoro, is held hostage, and Kokoro is the only thing he has left of his dead mother, since she gave him Kokoro in her last moments.!<

Final line: >!""I had no choice! My secret would have been exposed if I didn't do anything! I had no choice!""!<

Culprit: >!Victoria (Victoria is put inside a escape room where she has to solve puzzles, like putting items where they go after finding them, rearranging a puzzle on the door, solving a riddle, to continue, like a video game, but when she completed the last puzzle, she gets lava poured onto her, and she burns to death. This is a ""you get a chance to survive fake out"" execution.)!<

Twist: >!Anastastia is the mastermind!<

Final line: >!""I didn't know I even took her life! I never meant to hurt her! I never meant to hurt her! Please, don't execute me!""!<

4th motive: Each day, the remaining players are forced to play games, games meant to break them down mentally, and the only way to make it end is to kill someone.

Victims: >!Anne (burned) and Bai (froze)!<

Culprit: >!Yuri (Yuri walks down the hall, until she entered her psychic reading room, where she place the first tarot card, showing her parents fighting. Yuri pauses, and placed her second tarot card, where it shows her reading tarot cards. Yuri then placed her third tarot card, where it showed her grave. She then moved to her crystal ball, where it showed her reading tea leaves, which she ends up doing after, showing her a serpent symbol next to the letter Y, and she is handed a gun, to which she responds with shoots herself. She has a cancer that is slowly killing her, and she became a psychic to get money fast. Turned out she isn't a real psychic but a con artist just so she can get treatment.)!<

Twist: >!Thomas had Akira's secret, and that the secret is that Akira hides that he is gay due to his origins. Thomas then hugs Akira and told him he doesn't have to hide anymore. This accelerates Thomas' role as the love interest.!<

Final line: >!""It's funny. I predicted my plan would be a success. But, maybe it wasn't I who was meant to succeed. Akira, I believe the person who I predicted to succeed wasn't me, but you. It's telling me you'll do something drastic, but it's a necessary measure. Whatever you'r planning, stick with it. My prediction says you'll save five lives at the cost of two.""!<

Surviving Players: 9

Chapter 5: Bloody Mary

Rooms unlocked: Gym, Bowlng Alley

5th motive: >!The lights turn off, and noises will be played. A demon is then summoned to hunt down the players. If the demon catches you, you will be tormented for hours. The only way to make it stop is to kill someone. The demon can also possess players.!<

Victim: >!Hans (binded to the floor, in his swimsuit, and has a pentagram carved into his chest with five candles lit, with his blood in a goblet)!<

Culprit: >!Miguel (is sent into a wrestling match, where he has to knockout three opponents, but his last opponent spat poison into his eyes, blinding him, and ripped Miguel's head off. This reflects how Miguel refuses to ever play dirty, and is punished for fighting fair, unlike the real world.)!<

Twist: >!Hajime, Antonio, and Min-seo were not originally supposed to be in the killing game, they actually were captured after trying to save the students.!<

Final line: >!""Sofía, mi amor, por favor, perdóname, pues maté a un hombre y ahora moriré por mis crímenes. No viviré para verte, y ese es mi mayor arrepentimiento. Dios, si puedes oírme, te pido perdón, pues he pecado y ahora moriré por ello. Perdóname, te lo ruego.""!<

Surviving Players: 7

Rooms unlocked: Attic, Basement

Final motive: Each day, a basic human necessity will be revoked from the students, water, sleep, food, warmth, etc. Meanwhile, frequencies that makes people lose their minds start playing. The only way to end this is to kill someone.

Victim: >!Nico (poisoned, with cuts on his wrist, ankles, and back)!<

Culprit: >!Akira and Anastasia (Akira and Anastasia are dragged into a dark room with only one light. They are both given a gun, specifically, a six barrel rifle, and they can put up to six bullets in, then roll a six sided dice. Whoever wins can either shoot at themselves or the other, twist the barrel then shoot, or make the other add or subtract a bullet before the loser shoots at either themselves or the winner. After hours of this, Akira wins the last dice roll, and twists the barrel, and shoots Anastastia in the head. He officially survived the execution. Anastasia, being familiar with Russian Roulette, was confident she would win, but spent her last moments humbled and cursing Akira's name.)!<

Twist: >!Akira tricked Anastasia into poisoning Nico's meal along with him, causing Anastasia and him to be the blackened, and ending the killing game. Also Anastasia gave Nico the injuries thinking Akira was the sole blackened and just wanted to fuck with Akira.!<

Final line: >!""I offered you guaranteed survival, and you repay me with this? No matter, I will still win. I always win. Say your goodbyes, volleyball boy, because you'll be dead before you know it.""!<

Final line: >!""What I did..... was wrong....... but, if it was the cost of two lives to save four, whether the second life was mine or Anastasia's....... yeah, I'll do it again. We're free, everyone.""!<

His dog ate something in the process and might die and he wants to make that my problem. Is this a liability that I may just have to get rid of?

So this weekend has been a rollercoaster. 

Long version:

First off my pile has been rancid since summer started. I started the pile at least a month and half before summer with kitchen scraps and cardboard. It grew fast and showed zero signs of shrinkage. But the moment summer hit it started going rancid no matter how much browns I added to it. Aside from a tiny brown bag of coffee I didn't add any greens to it and I was turning it every week. 

Come to find out my neighbor has been adding everything under the sun to the pile except for browns. He's cleaned out his fridge, the food banks old food, thatch from his lawn after mowing, and dropped rotting fruit from his various fruit trees. I never noticed because he said he would split the stack and bury all of it in the middle so no animals would get to it. I just thought it had to much rain and nothing was really breaking down that well. The pile has technically stayed the same size this entire summer. 

I only found this all out because at some point he put multiple rotisserie chickens in the piles and when I turned them they were weeks or so old and on top and while he was burying more things his dog ate it and had to be rushed to the vet. And on top of that he wants me to pay the bill because I'm the one creating the danger for any animals to get into. 

Note: my yard is fenced, he's going through the side gate and then another gate I have up to stop my own dogs from getting into that area. ",23,1759115405.0,composting,16,0.9,False

Used to be 3, but my brother committed suicide in March. He was 25. My sister is 34. My parents have been divorced since 2004 and I have always lived with my mother. Both of my siblings were physically abusive towards me. Petty arguments always led to them attacking me. My parents never did anything to make me feel safe. I moved out from 2022-2023 but came back because I couldn’t afford it. The abuse never stopped and I was treated like I was the bad person. My brother would hit me the most. One time he came in my room while I was completely naked and choked me all because our dog was in my room. Another time he choked me because he took my wet clothes out of the dryer and put his in, so I took them out. The scariest time was when he beat me, kicked me, choked me, and stomped on me. I would call the police and nothing would happen. They even tried to arrest me when I was obviously the one battered because the cup I was holding when he attacked me broke and cut him. They said it was assault with a weapon…Just bs. :/ I would get yelled at by my parents and they would threaten to kick me out because I called the police. I was so traumatized I had nightmares every single night even when I moved out. I would dream about my siblings killing me while my parents stood there and did nothing. Every night. They only recently stopped after my brother passed away. In April, my dad lied to the police and told them i was suicidal to stop me from getting an uber home from the bar because I didn’t want to go with him. I was there for two weeks having to pretend I was fine right after losing my brother. I was so angry. It was selfish and not what “was best for me.” As he keeps saying. I havent talked to him or my sister since then. The other day my mother told me I need to find somewhere else to live all because I went to the store at night for something to drink. Today she sent me a text letting me know that they’re all going out to eat. I asked where so she could just bring me something back and she said no. Like damn…wow. Why even tell me? I am just beyond tired and fed up with this treatment that I don’t deserve. What did I do so wrong? Why does my family treat me like this? It hurts so much. I am so tired of being hurt. The minute i call out their behavior they have selective amnesia. They can never admit to their wrongdoings. They act so confused when I react the way I do. They call me crazy and tell me I need help. I have never put my hands on my siblings or parents yet they have ALL put their hands on me, even my father. My mother is a mental health nurse practitioner but when I was at my lowest, she told me I was faking it and asked me “why are you doing this to me?” In the middle of my panic attack. My mom and my sister laughed at my self harm. My mom told her friends sensitive information about my health as gossip. That’s just the tip of the iceberg. I would NEVER do these things. NEVER. Not to my siblings, not to my parents, not to my future children. I can’t understand why they do me like this. I had to get stitches in February because my sister came in my room and beat me while I was naked. I had a black eye, cuts everywhere, and burns from coffee she threw in my face. I called the police and guess what? Nothing. They tried to get me with assault AGAIN because I threw a plastic cup that didn’t hit her! My knee, where the stitches were, still hurts to this day. I don’t know if it will ever be the same. My mother tries to guilt trip me because I don’t speak to her or my father. I’m sick of it.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I'm a ""visual artist"". I make paintings, drawings, etc. I work from home and I'm self- employed. 

My husband is also self-employed and working from home and he's the one lifting heavy and large objects for me.

My stomach is less gassy, less hard, and less feeling heavy. My incisions look like they are healing.

I TRIED BLACK COFFEE TODAY and I'm okay! 

My incisions look like they are healing. And I have to keep in mind that even if I'm feeling 80% normal, I still can't abuse it. I still do my best to remember not to lift heavy objects. 

Also force is equivalent to mass so if you have to push or pull a large heavy object, it's the same as lifting, so don't do it. 

I can imagine that if you're alone and is recovering from surgery, it's difficult and I'm so sorry for that. Hugs to you.

If my husband is not around, maybe I can do some alternative into lifting heavy objects fot example: transferring water or rice in small portions. And if I can't think of any alternative, screw it. 

Nobody wants to have a hernia or any reasons to go back to the hospital. 

I just wanna shout out to the world that my husband is my rock - he's amazing and I'm so fortunate. 

Lastly, it's very important to rest. Sleep and rest help the body to repair and recover.

My apologies in advance if my post is lacking, this is my first reddit post. This is also my attempt at a “throw away account”, as I have a slight following on other platforms and really do not want people (followers or friends) to know that this is my post. Very long post incoming so: 

TLDR; After 2 years of dating, I feel as if my boyfriend has been regressing instead of maturing (with major life events like his proposal making it more obvious).

Let’s get right to it with the backstory: My boyfriend and I began dating during the second half of our last year of secondary school, officially becoming a couple the day after my 18th birthday. During our first date we were straightforward with one another about our life plans as major life changes were obviously coming our way. He was undecided on the specifics, but said he would join the military to which I said I’d be perfectly fine with (coming from a military family) so long as he didn’t expect me to uproot all my life plans and follow him anywhere and everywhere, to which he said he understood. I was already planning to move to a nearby college town with my close friend to complete my degree.  Relationship goes on, everything is absolutely perfect from the beginning. He had a somewhat dysfunctional family life, so my home becomes our hang-out spot and my family hosts him at most of our meals. Only argument we ever had was him accusing me of cheating because he went through my phone while I was sleeping and found a random message of some guy shirtless in an app I hadn’t used since long before our relationship began, who I had never conversed with and I had never even opened the message (so obviously not cheating). He leaves for bootcamp around 8/9 months into our relationship, we sent letters every week, called every chance we got, and made it through the two months without a doubt in our minds about our relationship. I coordinated the trip to attend his graduation on the other side of the country for his mother, myself and my mother (who fronted the cost of most of the trip as neither his mother nor I had the means to). Very stressful due to MIL being indecisive and prone to panic, but we made it, picked him up, visited some of extended family in the area, and brought him home for the holidays before he left to his first station; on the other side of the world. He put this location as #1 on his list of dream locations to be assigned, which I understood to some degree because I encouraged him to use his career to his advantage and travel, but we’re talking 6-hour time difference, 24 hour long air travel, thousands of miles apart literally on an island in the middle of the Pacific. He then proceeded to try and talk me out of moving into the place I had already signed a lease on while he was in boot camp, to move with him (I did not, I was firm on this). 

We had already discussed marriage because both of us dating with that intention, but we had our second ever argument came while ring shopping over the holidays because I told him exactly what I wanted. He said he didn’t want to “just buy me another thing”, and wanted to be involved in the decision. Over the coming months, he moved to his station and I made an in-depth slideshow of basically exactly what I wanted while clarifying where he had creative liberties and all the details and information he needed to not be taken advantage of by a jeweler (I wanted to pursue jewelry design at the time so this was all very specific and clearly important to me but I understood he wanted to be involved so I tried to make it possible with him having hardly any knowledge on the subject). As far as the proposal went I just asked that he put some legitimate effort into it (a.k.a just make it feel like a special private moment) and make sure it was photographed as my mother’s biggest regret around her proposal, wedding and other life events was not having any photos. A go pro would’ve been just fine, but I sent the social media accounts professional photographers I liked anyway in case he decided to go that route. Issues were slowly arising during these months, nothing totally detrimental though. I visited him at his station for the first time this past spring (5-6 months after he’d moved there) and we’d been talking about getting engaged so much that I explicitly stated, repeatedly, that “Hey btw if it doesn’t happen during this trip that’s totally fine, I’d rather it take forever to happen than have you rush it.” I visited for two weeks. The issues were glaring now. We hardly left the apartment, he left me at the apartment without food or a key to access the amenities 3/4 of the time I was there, expected me to make any and all plans, openly said we could just “play house” the whole time because I’d “obviously get to come back”, and we argued over intimacy repeatedly. I have PCOS and Endometriosis causing me to be unable to enjoy those things, and apparently they were incredibly important to him. Sparing you the nitty gritty, we engaged in activities that caused me harm because I thought I was being a poor partner by essentially depriving him of something that he couldn’t seem to live without, not knowing at the time that my conditions had brought on pelvic floor muscle dysfunction. By the end of the two weeks I could not wait to get home, but he begged me to extend my trip by a few more days as he’d finally made plans for us. I caved and extended the trip by a few days, and guess what happened? Proposal. This part of the story is already incredibly long so I’ll skip the details and maybe share in the comments but it was decent, although obviously rushed. I said “Yeah?” in the moment because I was truly at a loss of words, we took a slew of photos with a photographer, went to breakfast at a coffee shop (neither of us drink coffee and it’s the one smell in the world that gives me an automatic migraine). I knew in my gut I couldn’t leave this island engaged the following morning so I asked to go home for a nap, but he laid down right next to me to sleep as well so I got up and went to sit outside. I was in a precarious situation as I honestly did not know how he’d react to the news and if I would be safe being in his home so far from mine. Called my mom and best friend, explained the situation, sobbed, and shared locations. Broke the news, he threw a bit of a fit in my opinion but things were okay enough that we went to a dinner show later that night and he took me to the airport the next day. During that ride he asked what I planned to do when we were engaged (ex. “just put the ring on and finally tell everyone because obviously I’m not supposed to propose again?”). He didn’t text or call me until basically a day after I got home, and hardly spoke to me after that because his feelings were hurt. 

This is where the issue of regression became clear to me. I’m an eldest daughter and have always been the “independent, mature, wise for your age, problem-solver” and although he has many siblings he was basically raised as an only child due to age gaps so I imagine this could contribute to how our relationship dynamic has ended up here. Between the lack of planning on his end for the whole trip, the way he’d been speaking so crudely to me for months up until now, asking me to plan how we get engaged in the future, asking me to figure out what we do with the ring now, and the following months of him complaining on the phone to me about how expensive door-dashing me half dead flowers once a month (without my asking or pressuring) was on him, to how I wasn’t calling him enough despite the fact that he wasn’t initiating any calls, to how our relationship was boring because I wasn’t pursuing anything sexually (he was flat out ignoring the fact that I’d begun medically induced menopause to function daily), and wasn’t complimenting him enough. We’ve had several conversations about how I had continued all this post-proposal while he turned into a brick wall, and have only recently stopped because I won’t keep watering dead plants if he won’t at least try to reciprocate. I was also on a family trip at the time, giving me less time to maintain the relationship for both of us. I’ve repeatedly asked for more maturity and initiative on his end of things, especially because I feel myself growing as an individual and am ready to make some big life decisions that I either need to incorporate him into or plan without him. Since all this, I have moved out and he has visited before leaving for another state to attend schooling. We saw each other for all of 48 hours, he stayed the night at my place with no housewarming gift/gesture, we missed our “date” he’d finally planned the following morning because he wanted to do intimate activities despite me literally being in physical therapy for my pelvic floor being so screwed, then took a nap and made me late to my physical therapy appointment that very day. We visited my parents and spent the night there, where he wanted to be intimate again the next morning which I stopped quickly. He left that afternoon and since getting to school we’ve maybe called twice in the month he’s been there which is apparently my fault although he doesn’t have access to his cellphone half the day every week day and spends the entire time he does have it on weekends out with friends, not to mention we hardly text because he won’t speak about anything other than small talk with me. 

Ultimately I need help deciding if breaking things off now would be rash because I told him nearly a year ago that I wanted him to aid in my recovery after my laparoscopy (endometriosis surgery) which is now happening over the holiday season and he found a loophole in his employment to make that happen and plans to be here. The problem is my surgeon has already told me this procedure will probably be intense (laparoscopic procedure consisting of ablation of excess tissue [likely grown up into my chest cavity and on sciatic nerve], hysteroscopy, hernioplasty, possible egg retrieval), and the last thing I want is to have to “teach” him how to care for me like I’ve had to “teach” him how to cook or clean things he’s always been able to do himself while in pain and incapable of normal function. My best friend advises me to wait things out a while (mainly because she’s heard me say I’m afraid of making a rash decision and regretting it), while my parents and other close friends say it’s probably just time to walk away. I think I need someone else to just flat out tell me what needs to be done because I’m putting it off due to not wanting to deal with the emotions (I’m a full time student on that mf grind so I quite literally do not have time for distractions [aka emotional rollercoasters]).

Referral Code: AYLGY54DAG

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.

* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles.

* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to track donations across centers; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.

1. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.

1. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).

1. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

1. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

1. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

1. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.

1. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

1. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

1. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).

* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).

* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.

* Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

1. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

1. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

I shouldn't be eating at this hour, but I got hungry fifteen minutes ago. I made some garlic bread, but the sight of food repulsed me. I like garlic, salty things, and sour things. I don't like sweet things that much, I even prefer ice cream with very sour cherries, I don't know why I don't want to eat what I've made, I'd rather not waste the eggs.

I have hypomagnesemia and vitamin D deficiency. Otherwise, I feel fine. I don't know how. Episodes like these, where food itself takes away my hunger, are recurrent and annoying when you're on pills. It's good to have something thick that I can drink. Yogurt, for example, is easier to eat than something solid.

They say vitamin D deficiency could be a cause or aggravation of my depression. I don't know. Now I'm drinking sugar-free hot chocolate. It's weird that even though I prefer bitterness, I don't like coffee more than hot chocolate. Anyway, I have to find something quick to fill my stomach before taking more pills.

So when they set an opening date I told my 14yo we could go the summer before he started high school. A summer vacation/middle school graduation combo, if you will.

We went late August.  Even coming from the northeast, we are well versed in the heat and expected afternoon rains of Florida.  No biggie - as expected.  All good. 

We read the reddits, watched the youtubes, checked the maps and menus.  We made our own ""must do"" and ""skippable"" lists.

Overall - we had a great day!  We did everything we wanted to do.  If we didn't do our homework, and ALSO remain flexible, our day could have gone much differently.

We took a rideshare in and arrived about 40 minutes before ""official"" opening.  We headed straight for BATM because we read it might open early and to avoid potential breakdown delays later in the day.  This strategy worked. It opened early and we walked in with little wait (almost toooo little wait because the queue was amazing visually but we had to keep moving). We were out and enjoyed our first ""must do"" crepe treat plus an extra cup of coffee for mom - by 10:10 am.  

We skipped over to Dark Universe and did the roller coast and indoor ride with little wait.  Decided to come back and re-do both again after dark.  Black toilets are disconcerting.  Monsters Unchained is SO underrated I don't get it.

Stopped at Stardust Racers on our way to Berks.  45-ish wait? Not sure what was happening - only one track running and we were the last group allowed through before it delayed completely again. Maybe weather but I don't think so.  Awesome ride but for us a ""once a day/trip"" ride.  It was great but not something we could ride back to back just too much g-force action.  It was amazing though.

Off to Berks. we wanted to see the Untrainable Dragon show, do Wing Gliders, didn't care about Dragon Racer's Rally and only interested in Fyre Drill if we needed something to cool off.  Our timing was good for the next Untrainable Dragon show  which was cute... but Toothless was ""away"", which wasn't clearly explained up front and led to an extended overly-dramatic dry ice fog to mask Hiccup's entry that was both annoying and anti-climatic.  Also glad we went, especially since it was the last show of the day. Not sure what happened but the remaining show times ended up cancelled.

After the show, we headed to Wing Gliders which had a reasonable wait but questionable weather on the way.  We got almost to the lockers before lightening shut it down. We elected to stay in line since we were under cover and the sky OPENED as they do in Florida in the summer.  Overall hung about an hour for the rain to pass before ditching for a snack.  Glad we stayed put  - outside the ride queue it was clear people were jammed in bathrooms and limited food service seating during the worst of the downpours.  We grabbed a couple of mac and cheese cones for a snack.  Spoiler alert it's just mac and cheese (and/or pork) layered in a hollowed out cone shaped bun with everything bagel seasoning on the outside.  It was good, but not getting the hype.

Off we crossed to Nintendo. Passing through the portal was very cool. Once we got to the top of the escalator, it was a different story.  The immersion was amazing, but the sensory overload was pure hell.  I respect why some people and children enjoy it but it was pulling Simpson's Krusty the Klown way more than Hey it'samee Mario.  Just wow.  We wandered a bit, glad we didn't buy the bands to play the mini games (because it was just that chaotically overstimulating) and headed to Donkey Kong.  It was a long wait but we hadn't waited much yet and it was marked as ""closing early"", so we decided to suck it up and get in line.  It was 75 minutes when we got in line, but was closer to 120.  Around 90 minutes we started getting threatened with weather related closure, then non-weather related delay and finally we got on.  It wasn't worth it.

Because so many rides close during rain, by the time we got out Mario Kart had cleared out and was basically a ""walk on"" @ 20 ish minutes.  It was OK.  Staff were disengaged and not helpful.  Gameplay explanation was left to video pictograms with no dialogue.  I am the worlds worst Mario Kart player and I won for our vehicle.  Son unimpressed.

We didn't care to wait for Yoshi for any more than 15 minutes (it was 60) and our brains hurt, so we headed out.

My son convinced me to try and make another run at Hiccup's despite rain threatening on the way.  I wanted to find someplace under cover for food before we got stranded in a bathroom for the next storm.   We bartered, he won.  We managed to eek out one run on Wing Gliders before it shut down for storming.  Great ride.  He was right.

As soon as we got off we BOOKED it for Pizza Moon to have a rest.  We no sooner sat down when the sky OPENED again and people flooded in and they went to wait line for tables.  Witnessed some really special and obnoxious entitled human behavior trying to sit without eating.  Enjoyed some pizza and a glass of wine and my kiddo indulged me after riding the carousel.

After THAT we headed back to Dark Universe to ride the coaster and Monsters Unchained after dark which was AWESOME.  These are totally under rated rides.

Neither of us were up to Stardust Racers again but we did squeak into queue for one more ride on Wing Gliders before park closing.

Overall - we had an AWESOME day!  We went on a Sunday, no Express Passes or Early Entry.  We did our research ahead and decided what was important and what wasn't.  I love all my family but I really love going to theme parks with only two people. It makes switching gears so much easier and even more so with older kids.

All that said.  We had a great day but as others have noted, so many rides are taken down by weather and there aren't enough other ""things"" to balance the load. I owe another adult kid a FL trip but at this point I think we're going to let this one marinate until it finds it's groove and identity. Long lines does not make it a ""full day"" park.... it seems to want to cater to everyone, but doesn't have enough to cater to any one demographic a full day experience at the same time if that makes sense.   We spent a lot of time doubling back and forth and even snack carts were difficult to find.  I desperately wanted something sweet after dinner but it was either too far away or not available.  Even popcorn.  So strange.  

We enjoyed... just not in a hurry to head back for a bit.  Cheers!

Disclaimer – About Trypophobia:  
If you suffer from this phobia, please avoid viewing the next pictures.

Hi everyone!

Recently, while washing my espresso filter baskets from MHW-3BOMBER, something funny happened... I have one BEP basket (15g) and two DEX baskets (18g and 20g).

Dialing in between those filters has always been a bit of a challenge. With the 20g basket, extraction is consistently good and well-balanced.

Using the 15g basket, I need to grind considerably finer to maintain the same ratio (as expected)... But the shot runs incredibly fast.

The 18g basket should be somewhere in the middle, but it's ALWAYS very confusing. I couldn't establish a clear correlation between the amount of coffee and grind size compared to the others.

During the cleaning process, I poured water directly into the 20g and 18g DEX baskets. To my surprise, the flow was slower in the 20g basket. I know the internal size is different, but it was really slower—like 3 to 4 times slower than the 18g.

The 15g BEP basket is faster than both. In fact, it's 2 to 3 times faster than the 18g.

Tasting notes:

- 15g – Mostly acidic. The extraction starts slow but speeds up dramatically after a few seconds. With grind adjustments, I can get good extractions between 20–40 seconds.
- 18g – Typically inconsistent. Some shots are great, others not so much... Consistency is the challenge.
- 20g – Always balanced. There's plenty of room to fine-tune the grind size.

So...  
Am I getting a little help from the flow restriction in the 20g basket?

OR...

Am I just a crazy coffee person trying to explain nonsense that isn’t even a thing—maybe it’s all about the coffee bed?

Funny enough, the holes in the 15g basket look smaller than in the others.

Ratios used: 1:2 ~ 1:3  
Time: 20 ~ 40s

Coffee types tested:
- Medium roast – Low acidity profile  
- Medium-dark roast  
- Dark roast

Lots of testing was done... Haha!

1nt704a,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1nt704a/smallspace_coffee_setup_to_replace_my_daily_café/,Small-space coffee setup to replace my daily café black coffees - all-in-one espresso vs. grinder + AeroPress [$250],"Hey coffee folks! I'm trying to cut back on buying black coffees outside and finally set up something at home. Space is limited, so I first looked at in-built grinder espresso machines, but I keep reading they're high-maintenance and pricey. Now I'm wondering if a small grinder + AeroPress (or similar) is the smarter move for taste vs. cost and upkeep.

What I care about

I mostly drink black coffee (Americanos or drip-style). Milk drinks are rare.

Small footprint and easy maintenance are big priorities.

I'd like good flavor without a 20-minute ritual every morning.

Budget is flexib t I don't want to overspend if the taste gains are minor.

Options I'm considering

1. All-in-one espresso machine (with built-in grinder) - worried about long-term reliability/servicing.

Small grinder + AeroPress compact and cheap, but is the cup quality close to café drip/Americano?

2.

3. Hand grinder + pour-over (V60/ Kalita) or Moccamaster-style small brewer - more parts, but maybe better consistency?

4. Manual espresso + hand grinder (Flair/Robot) - smaller than a full machine, but is the workflow fussy for daily use?

Questions

For black-coffee drinkers, is espresso gear overkill vs. a good grinder + AeroPress/pour-over?

If you've owned Il-in-one, how was maintenance (c ng the grinder nath descaling renairs)?

Any compact grinder recs that punch above their weight for filter (and maybe espresso later)?

If you went AeroPress or pour-over, what's your simple daily workflow (kettle, grind setting, recipe) that still tastes great?

Pls any options, thanks in advance 🙏 ",1,1759114143.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

Lately I've been introspecting and thinking about the relationships in my life, with family, friends and my girlfriend. All of this thinking has led to me concluding that I'm pushing everyone away and pretty much imploding. 

I find it very difficult to express my thoughts in words. I've been in the States for a few months (2-3) and it's been very lonely. People at my place of work aren't there most sociable and besides work and the daily afternoon coffee run, we hardly talk about anything else. 

Coming to family and friends, I wasn't successful in making close friends in college.  I did finally become a part of a group but then college ended. Everyone's busy with their internships in the same city, it feels sad to see them have fun while I'm here in another country all alone. It's the same with family, I haven't been to any major family events in about 4-5 years now, since I started college away from home. 

My girlfriend is usually my corner stone, we've been dating for a few years now. It's a LDR but we plan to live together next year. The thing is, we've been having major fights lately and broke ups few months ago, a combination of things and me going to another country was a part of it. We do talk now, but the 9 hour time difference makes things really really difficult. 

I can see my relationships ending and I feel helpless to change that. 

I have a few predictions for myself for the upcoming 3 months:
- me and my girlfriend break up forever
- I burn away whatever money I have on weed (already at 150 dollars a month)
- I fall back into the dark place I crawled out of last year

Idk what I'm doing. I feel extremely clueless. If everything goes the way it's going right now, I'll end up with no job, no PhD accepts and no friends. 

Fun thing is, I'm pretty good at what I do. And I've seen people with no skill get into places I've been rejected from (I don't wanna hear skill issue). 

Ahhh idk what I'm doing. I lie in bed all day after and before work. I smoke up pretty much everyday and have started smoking cigarettes too (didn't know you could throw up if you smoke too much). 

I know a simple solution would be to join groups on meetup or something, and yes I normally would. I've made Reddit posts looking for friends, I've even gotten replies. But I end up ghosting then after a few days or it just trails off. I've noticed I'm boring, and it's possible I'm antisocial or having been feeling that way for a bit now. 

I'm usually not like this, but I'm seeing myself go down a path that I know won't end well for me and idk what to do to stop it. And I guess that helplessly watching all this is frustrating and taking a toll on my well being. 

P.S. 
No idea what I'm tryna achieve with this post or with my life in general. 

Also, I've noticed that I tend to victimize myself sometimes, maybe this is that, who knows. Worst case I just added to the millions of random Reddit posts. ",0,1759113257.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False
1nt6pxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aupairs/comments/1nt6pxj/au_pair_with_a_lack_of_initiative/,Au pair with a lack of initiative,"We are hosting an au pair from Colombia, she’s helping with our one year old child. This post is long and somewhat a rant but also it’s me asking for advice how to address the lack of initiative my au pair has been showing so far. 

She gets along so well with him and they play happily so that’s great, and she’s generally a cheerful optimistic person. I’ve done tremendous work on her house-etiquette already but we have ways to go in that department. 

I’m generally pleased with her because I know when I leave the house, my child will read books with her, play, eat well most of the time and take naps well so it’s a win. A lot of things are far away from perfect but I still discount it since she’s been with us for only 2.5 months. She’s learning some house skills and childcare skills as she goes and as I train her to do better, but some things I’m afraid I don’t know how to train.

For example, when she first started I had to tell her what to do every 5 minutes which actually defends the purpose of getting childcare help if I have to be present constantly to ensure everything is going well. Like I had to tell her “AP, time to change his diaper.” She goes and takes it off. Then I have to mention “oh yeah you have to clean him before you put a new diaper on.”. She proceeds. Then “ok now dispose and used diaper. Yeah, it goes in diaper genie. Well done!”. I understand there’s a learning curve but it should be intuitive that once you change a baby, you threw away used diaper, right? 

Then I had to explain that I’m not her maid and she needs to clean her dishes and put them in dish washer. Then also put clean dishes back up. One step at a time…

She mopped the floors in her area and then I had to tell her she also has to dispose the water and clean the rag after use. Super intuitive things that are such common sense to me. I no longer think there are any “crazy house rules” because I wouldn’t think of outlining simple routines like that, but in my case it makes sense unfortunately. I sent her all those instructions in writing to minimize language barrier issue as well.

If in the morning I hand my son to her and he only has his diaper on, when I get him from her a few hours later, he often isn’t dressed. Unless I specifically tell her to dress him, she won’t budge. Also she feeds him and leaves bottles around the house when it was outlined she’s responsible for washing them and at least putting them in dish washer, no need to wait until no clean bottle is available. 

Then house etiquette. If I cook a nice 2-3 course dinner, and maybe even bake some dessert, it’s customary for another person to offer to do the dishes. She doesn’t. For the first 2 weeks she never cooked for herself and only ate when I cooked, then also ate the leftovers I put in the fridge so I was forced to cook daily, and I didn’t have to before she arrived. I’ve noticed if I didn’t cook she’d just eat sandwiches that aren’t even toasted and had most random ingredients so I felt bad for her for obviously not knowing how to even fry an egg (lied about being self sufficient in interview). Then she played with my son and he threw tens of toys out of his pen, she’d just walk away and sit and chill in the same room with us when it was her time off but she wouldn’t have an initiative to tidy up the space. It’s much better now, but when I made gentle remarks at first it didn’t help. I had to tell her 3-5 times a day to pick up toys and put things up or I’d spend time doing it instead of having quality time with my family instead. I literally had to tell her very straightforward that I did not welcome another person (that I also pay) in my home and family just to cook and clean 3x more than I did before and have less time to rest or spend with my son. She drastically improved after that but needs at least a bi-weekly written reminder of morning and evening routines and the fact that it’s her responsibility to tidy up play areas. 

My irritation with that peaked when we returned from a 10 day luxury beach vacation with her (where she had 4.5 days off to do whatever she wanted and the whole trip was 100% paid by me and she of course had her private bedroom and bathroom) and she didn’t even think of helping unpacking baby’s things! Also did not volunteer to hold the baby once for whole duration of a travel but helped herself to food that I was paying for 3 times on the way to the destination, when even I only ordered and ate once. When I asked her how she enjoyed the trip, she said it was hard, and getting there was hard (3 hours flight where she wasn’t responsible for my son at all and was just sitting with her headphones on.), and she’s just glad we are finally going back. It was literally her second time taking a flight in her life so I tried not to judge that too hard. The evening of our return she knocked on my door right at his bedtime asking to clean my cats vomit from her room. (Cat was left at the house and we had cat sitter see him every other day and apparently he threw up on AP’s bedroom wood floor while we were gone). I told her I’ll clean in the morning, I have a crying boy in my arms. In the morning she walked up to me reminding me about the clean up. For reference, she has a whole 3rd floor to herself (private bedroom, closet, bathroom, balcony and coffee station and small living room space) so I never pass by her territory, we stay downstairs. I know my cat isn’t her responsibility, but accidents do happen and she’s a member of this household. If it’s in her personal territory it’s fair and normal to clean it up yourself, especially since we have adequate cleaning supplies and gloves available. She didn’t clean it and came running to me in the morning saying it’s still there letting it soak into the floor more than it would have taken nothing but a minute to clean earlier and she wouldn’t have to sleep in a room with it ugh 😩 

We also have quite an annoying food-related issue going on but I don’t want to make 100th “my au pair eats all our food” post on here, and I’m currently trying another strategy to try to fix that. Hopefully I won’t come buck to this sub discussing our version of never ending food situation issues in this program. 

How to tackle lack of initiative and not following routines issue? Some times it gets on my nerves so bad I browse other au pairs on the agency web site and read horror stories on this Reddit. But I believe she’s a decent persona and my son likes her so I’d rather work on it. Just “having a discussion” doesn’t seem to work. 

I’m a little worried I made it very specific and she might be on Reddit in this sub too. Well, if you are - then you know what you need to work on to help improve life for all of us. ",0,1759113245.0,Aupairs,56,0.38,False

Hiya! I’m a fifteen year old writer who has just made her first story! If any of you guys would like to share any advice or tips on the plot, characters, behaviors, etc, please let me know!

DISCLAIMER: this is JUST a rough draft, nothing is set in stone (i am just a girl lol)

In 1994, Katie Walters, the “mean girl” and the epitome of high-school perfection; popular, beautiful, dating the star football player, Trent Harrison, and living a seemingly idyllic life, but it still isn’t enough for her parents, is secretly dating a girl, specifically, her best friend and soccer teammate, Scarlett “Scottie” Parker, whom she is obsessed with. But then, the two get attacked by the football boys, including Trent, while they are drunk and leaving a party, and they attack Scottie to a pulp while Katie runs away; that same night, Katie’s conservative parents let Katie know that her grandmother is in the hospital, and that they are visiting her right now; when Katie arrives at the hospital and sees a doctor tending to a battered Scottie, she asks the doctor if she is going to be okay; that’s when she breaks the news; Scottie is in a coma. In 2021, Katie is now married to Trent, and they have one daughter, who they named Scarlett, who is 16 going on 30, after Scottie. Scottie finally wakes up; and the first thing she does is ask if Katie ran away from the football boys, and immediately digs into Katie’s new life. Scottie arrives while Trent and Scarlett are out of town for a father-daughter trip, asking if she could stay, just for a couple weeks. Katie says yes. Katie tells Scottie about Scarlett, the high school drama that happened while Scottie was out, Katie telling Scottie that she got pregnant with Scarlett right after they graduated, so her and Trent had to get married immediately after, in a courthouse, they argue, and Katie and Scottie finally kiss. Scarlett comes home, and sees them kiss. The next day, it’s Katie’s birthday. Scottie gives Katie a birthday cake, and she says that Scarlett and Trent are at a coffee shop. Katie also says that her and Scarlett will be going homecoming dress shopping, and says that Trent will just stay at the house, if Scottie is okay with that. Scarlett snitches on Scottie and Katie to Trent while they are out on a coffee date. While Katie and Scarlett go dress shopping for Scarlett homecoming, Trent and Scottie get in a fight, resulting in Trent stabbing Scottie. Trent then rushes out of the house, leaving Scottie on the kitchen floor to die. When Katie and Scarlett arrive, the house is a mess. Katie finds Scottie’s bloody body in the kitchen, begging her to wake up, saying that she always loved her. Scottie then dies in Katie’s arms. Scarlett then starts crying, telling Katie that she didn’t know that her dad would kill Scottie. Katie then lashes out at Scarlett.

I'm using the same coffee as my french press, so I'm familiar with the coffee I'm using.

  
I did measure the water temperature coming out of the spout using my mini thermometer. It measured right at 208-210 F, and for comparison measured 212-213 F in boiling water. This seems higher than what people are saying it should be - 195-205. And I've heard that too high a temp causes bitterness.

The flavor profile was incredible and I'm completely hooked. The complexity, balance, and overall taste experience was phenomenal.

1nt6hxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1nt6hxd/shots_flowing_extremely_fast_spilling/,Shots flowing extremely fast / spilling,"In the past couple of weeks, I've started to have an issue regarding weird and way too fast espresso shots. I haven't modified the coffee beans (even bought fresh ones) and tried many things to lower the extraction speed (finest possible grind size on the Baratza grinder, adding as much coffee beans as I could, etc.). I had the machine for over a year with no apparent problems and I've run a cycle of descaling and a cycle of backflush cleaning to no effect.

Any ideas on the reason behind it? I've attached a couple of vids / pictures for more context.

\- Video of normal water flow.

\- Video of measured pressure (10 bars) with the stock portafilter.

\- Video of espresso shot with a bottomless portafilter to see what is happening (note that I get the same behaviour with the stock portafilter)

\- Picture of the group head with the shower screen removed.

\- Picture of the coffee grounds after the shot

1nt6hrz,https://i.redd.it/troeilysk0sf1.png,Preparing for Digital ID & Banking Freezes (UK • Canada • Australia • USA),"With governments around the world exploring digital ID systems, some worry about potential financial restrictions tied to them. Regardless of where you live, being prepared ensures resilience. Here’s a quick guide:

---

🔑 Financial Prep

- Keep multiple bank accounts (include credit unions & local institutions).
- Store emergency cash at home in small denominations.
- Prepaid debit cards & money orders as backups.
- Prepay essentials like utilities, transport passes, and mobile data.
- Keep passports, driver’s licences, and physical ID documents up to date.

---

🏠 Household Readiness

- Stock non-perishable food (rice, pasta, canned goods).
- Keep bottled water & purification tablets.
- First aid kits, prescriptions, painkillers.
- Backup heating & lighting: blankets, candles, torches, batteries.

---

🔄 Barter System Readiness

- Everyday: Tea, coffee, sugar, soap, toilet rolls, plasters, matches.
- Medium Value: Spirits, chocolate, cooking oil, nappies, batteries, gas canisters.
- High Value: Tobacco, spices, seeds, blankets, solar chargers, first aid supplies.
- Skills as Currency: Cooking, sewing, DIY, gardening, tech repair, first aid.

---

👥 Community & Legal Prep

- Build trust with neighbours and local networks now.
- Identify shops & providers still accepting cash.
- Follow civil-liberties groups and official privacy commissioners.
- Keep written records if pressured into digital ID adoption.

---

⚖️ Tip: Stock more everyday essentials than you need — they’ll be your most valuable trade items.

👉 Share this to raise awareness. Preparedness is peace of mind.

The back says they are made of the same material (virgin pulp). Manufacturers are the same except the origami, but everything I’ve heard says they are made by Cafec. 

If they’re not the same, what’s the difference? I would love to know. The Cafec filters in the yellow packaging are new to me. Do they differ from the medium/dark roast Cafecs that are highly praised?
