I never ask her to do much at all and don’t expect much. She is always making my coffee and cooking things I like. Even if it’s things she doesn’t like to eat.  

She takes at least half or more of the duty of taking care of our indoor dogs which in itself is a big task. A bonus is she has taken it upon herself to clean and organize my work area and hobby room. It was one of those situations where a normal person would look at a junky room and think “Where do I even start?!” 

She prefers not being employed to spend more time with me and our dogs. I’m fine with that as we’re in a position that it’s possible on our budget. My WFH job is very stressful so her additional support is appreciated. 

I do my chores, yard work, home and vehicle maintenance, and other misc tasks. I have taken a more active role in doing things like keeping my work and hobby areas cleaner. When she forgets to do small things like leaving small pieces of trash or too much food on dirty dishes, I help her out and never mention it to her. I grab her a towel and washcloth when I bathe and also bring her snacks and drinks when I think she needs them.  

She never asks me for anything. I always offer to do things for her but she usually says not to worry about it. I still do some things anyway. I’m just out of ideas to do things to make her feel special.  

My only ideas are to bring her flowers or cards when I happen to be away from home and she’s not with me. I’m just out of ideas. ",1,1729368265.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

I met her through my sister, who is her close friend. Before we met, she had seen my picture and expressed interest in getting to know me. After about a week of messaging, we went on our first date, where we walked around, had coffee, and enjoyed each other's company. However, I realized that I wasn't ready for a romantic relationship, and shortly after that, she mentioned feeling overwhelmed with romance and needing time before pursuing another relationship. We both agreed to stay friends.

Recently, she mentioned feeling lonely and accepted my offer to hang out. We had a great time, but during our conversation, I unintentionally made a negative comment about something she’s dealing with, which seemed to upset her. After that, she hasn’t responded to my messages, leaving me uncertain about her feelings toward our friendship.

I’ve noticed that she seems warm and friendly when we text, but somewhat distant when we meet in person. I genuinely value our friendship, and I’m concerned that she may only see me as a fallback friend. I’d like to approach her about this and understand her feelings without making her uncomfortable.

# TL;DR:

I \[22M\] and \[22F\] agreed to stay friends after briefly dating. I’m confused about her feelings toward our friendship after a negative comment I made. I’d appreciate advice on how to clarify our relationship.",1,1729368252.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

My breastfed baby seems to have a dairy intolerance and so I'm having to eliminate dairy from my diet. I've also been gluten free for many years and since starting my UPF journey I've discovered the gluten free ""alternatives"" I was consuming were definitely UPF and I have had to cut them out which I have accepted but keen to hear from anyone who can make any suggestions in that regard. However cutting dairy out is going to be so difficult, I haven't done much research but I am assuming similar to gluten, dairy alternatives will be UPF. I eat overnight oats with greek yogurt every day. Milk in coffee. Cream cheese... So many things! I accept having to go without certain foods but would welcome some friendly signposting.

1g7he3t,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1g7he3t/were_in_a_relationship_but_officially_were_not/,We're in a relationship but officially we're not. It's complicated on an astronomica level.,"I [19m] met her [19f] last August. We have common friends and went to the same highschool and we follow each on instagram long before we met (but we never knew each other) one time she put a note on a reel and I replied with a joke and well that opened up a conversation. We got to know each other and stuff and let me tell you, something about her was different, she was extremely interesting to talk to and she wasn't dry at all, she did show a lot of interest. Normally when I like a girl it's because she looks pretty and then we get to talking, however this time I had no idea what she looked like yet I was forming the biggest crush of my life, it was all about who she was on the inside. That one conversation turned into us constantly talking, everyday, we'd send each other a hundred messages, she would always send me selfies without me asking at all and let me tell you, other people might consider her above average but to me she is the prettiest most cutest girl that has ever walked the planet in the history of the earth, she'd always look so pretty in my eyes no matter what. If she had just woken up, if her hair is messy, its impossible for me not to find her pretty, and none of my feelings were sexual at all, I find her pretty because it's the face that belongs to the soul I'm attached to. She shared every single little detail about her life, I wake up to her good morning texts, she's always sending me reels and i send her a lot too and she responds to every single one. I swear to god we'd have 3 seperate conversations simultniously on 3 different messaging apps, we'd have 2 hour long calls, we rarely double text each other but only because neither of us has to, we'd compliment each other a lot (I'd call her pretty, she'd call me handsome). I asked her out on a date 3 days after we met, it eventually happened, we just had coffee in the garden and we talked for 4 hours and there was never silence at all? It was a continuous conversation (I'm not exagerating we arrived at 9 am and went home at 1 pm only because she had something to do with her cousin). Btw all this was within the first 2 weeks. One time she got mad at me for talking to her for a day (i did but it was one dry convo). One time i was out with friends and didnt talk to her for 2 hours and when i got back she told me where the hell i've been (trust me she's not aggressive at I'm just summarizing). I make her laugh a lot, we bully each other a lot and we laugh at the things we say to each other. We went out on a lot of dates, I always paid (like the gentleman i am lol) she even told me she wants to go to the cinema (she's never been) and I told her i'd take her. Yesterday she called me in class so I hung up then she called again and I hung up again, then like 15 mins later she called again so I excused myself to the bathroom to call her (she thought I was home, she didnt know I had class all day). One time I told her good night at like 9 pm and she asked ""you're gonna sleep already?"" I said no (i was gonna work and then sleep) so she said ""then stay dont go, why are u going"", she intiates most conversations, she always calls me honey, i call her sugar. She only talks to 2 people, me and her bff, other people in her life are just there cause they either study with her in the same uni or they go in the same bus.
We are not in a relationship, yep you heard that right, all this is, honestly i dont even know what she considers it. Let me give you some context about her, she's almost a year older (she turns 20 soon) she had 2 bfs, she was always religious but she decided recently to take religion more seriously and well she closed the door on relationships, she says next step for her is marriage. Believe or not, despite all this, I don't know how she feels about me (yep guys can be that clueless) and I honestly have no clue what to do. I'm too attached to move on, don't tell me I'm young and I'll find someone else because I won't, not even something remotely close to this. I feel so comfortable talking to her, like I can say anything without watching what I say, I genuinely feel like I just act like myself and she'd seem so engaged in the conversation, no games at all, no rules to follow, just be myself with no limit, that's what I'm supposed to do. It feels like other girls I talk to are no longer interesting and they're just friends (even girls I used to like a lot) which is why I considered to ask her to marry me when we're both ready for that (I should mention we're one of those countries where its normal to get engaged like that with no relationship prior but by just asking her father for marriage). Is too early to choose my partner? Yes. But since nothing is official and she's not expecting anything from me it's fine, I can just change my mind.

I have been having on and off pain when I take a deep breath and sometimes when I’m laying in different positions.
It starts under my bellybutton and it ends I think in my urethra.
Sometimes it gets triggered after meals when I’m bloated or when I eat sugar but the worse is when I am feeling ok and then I take a wee and the pain is stabbing for about 10m in my urethra and under my bellybutton.

It all started when I got a bacteria infection on my stomach (helicobacter pylori) and had to take a heavy dose of antibiotics during 10 days on this February .
I had never had UTI before now I had 2 , 1 before the antibiotics and another some months after.

Along with losing 10kg and being severe underweight my gut is busted with lots of bloating  and my poor bladder has also been suffering.

I went to a gyno and she told me I had bacterial vaginosis and the walls inside my vagina were thin and red and gave me cream to use.
It really did work ! But after some weeks I got worse again , I think penetrative sex made it worse when peeing. It also now started to hurt just above the vagina opening ? Where those little bumps are ? The pain is just all over the place .

I went to the doctor again and she told me I might be too tight so she gave me some estrogen cream .
Do you all have some good experiences with estrogen  cream ? 

It’s weird because one day I am fine and the other when I go to pee it all starts all over again and my diet is very strict and boring since my stomach is still super sensitive. No alcohol no coffee no sauces no red meat no lactose.

I have cut all sugar ( sugar gummies that I was finally confident on trying because of my stomach) and been drinking 1l of water and taking cranberry supplements with lactobacilos probiotics.
I really miss being without pain and having carefree sex.

Sorry I guess this is more of a rant because I have been feeling really defeated since this stomach bacteria and the 120pills of antibiotics really wrecked my body and I’m just tired and depressed just want to feel healthy again .

Some were curious what I was wearing, considering how I was treated along the way. I had a Yankees cap on and was wearing a Patagonia pullover. I certainly didn't look like a slob, but I wasn't wearing anything flashy or showy either. 

Here's my overall ranking of these boutiques, based on the following categories: Hospitality, Ambiance, Staff Knowledge, and Display Range.

14. Rolex
13. Richard Mille
12. Vacheron Constantin

These boutiques had small collections on display (AP, Rolex, VC, RM), weird interactions with salespeople (Rolex, VC, Bremont, AP), or didn't attempt to make me feel welcome/actively turned me away from their store (AP, Richard Mille, Montblanc). In general, I would avoid visiting these storefronts, unless you have a particular goal in mind.

These boutiques were fine. I wasn't disappointed that I stopped in. I wasn't made to feel welcome, but I didn't feel unwelcome either. 

**Great Experience**
4. Breitling
3. Grand Seiko
2. Blancpain
1. Jaeger-LeCoultre

In all of these stores, I had great conversations with the staff (Grand Seiko, Blancpain). They talked to me about watches, allowed me to try watches on, were very patient, were not pushy, and in some cases offered me coffee or water (JLC, Breitling). If you are a watch enthusiast, I would recommend checking out these boutiques. They have a large number of pieces on display and an attentive staff.

If I had more time, I would have liked to visit the Omega and Cartier boutiques.

In general, I didn't speak to the staff unless spoken to. I wasn't looking for anything in particular,  For instance, I didn't speak to anybody at A. Lange & Söhne.

I didn't buy a watch on this trip. Though it was great to see a lot of fantastic pieces in person. In particular, I liked the JLC Polaris in green, the Lange 1 and 1815 Up/Down, and Grand Seiko 140th Anniversary Heritage (SLGH007) the most of the pieces that I saw, across my visit, though this is really just my preference.

It's a crappy-quality video that has some grandma talking about her grandson Jared from what looks like a laptop on a coffee table facing upwards toward the grandma.

This is the iconic quote that we've been saying just to remember that video with her little old person voice :  
""My graaaaaandson Jared keeps on sending me these HIP-HOP videos"" and so on.  
The part that we remember fondly is right after she says that, she goes more in depth and what at the time was funny to us about the video was that it seemed like this 80-year-old person started to enjoy herself a little too much about the hip-hop videos that Jared keeps sending. Just imagine some shitty quality video (plus audio) and some old person start moaning and basically caressing her upper self WHILST talking about Jared and the videos, It's wild. And the video cuts like that. Recently a buddy was saying that it might've been from PH or something but we've seen it years ago on other platforms like Instagram or YouTube. And trust me, we've looked in PH too; the sight is forever burned into our memory...

Anyway, we thought it was hilarious all those years ago and we'd be astonished if we ever found it again. But for now, our little inside joke of a quote will continue to thrive within the boiz for all eternity and be passed down through generations upon generations until every single star in the universe has been erased and all that is left is... mygrandsonjared.",1,1729366309.0,HelpMeFind,3,1.0,False

1g7gjlz,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExNoContact/comments/1g7gjlz/please_read_if_youre_going_through_it/,Please Read if you're going through it,"My reasons to not contact them and I hope this resonates with some of you:

1. They can find ways to reach out to me and they choose not to. They made the relationship crumble so they should be the ones reaching out with a plan, not just a simple ""how are you"".
2. I haven't spoken to them in weeks. For all I know they're already talking to someone else and I'd rather be ignorant to that fact than me reaching out and they tell me this. It would hurt me.
3. They may leave me on read or have me blocked. This would hurt.
4. They may respond but they're trying to be nice. The outcome I'm expecting is not what will happen 99% of the time. 
5. I'm not begging someone to be with me and I'm certainly not going to text them to talk to them about things we've previously talked about during the breakup. They already know how we feel and there is no amount of begging or forcing that we can do to change the fact that they don't want us.

The whole point is that things didn't work at this point in time. There's nothing that can change that and there was a reason for the breakup. Millions of people go through it everyday, we're not the only ones. We should grieve, feel, and attempt to move on.

Things that have helped also:
1. Not checking their socials or statuses. If this is hard to do, just delete the social or messaging apps until the strong urge passes. I had to do this and I felt much better.
2. Don't think they'll be coming back; try to get this thought out of your mind. I know social media and sometimes this forum makes us have hope but it is highly unlikely that they'll come back. Life is not black and white, it may or may not happen but for now they haven't come back. Use this time to work on you.
3. Read books, buy a new video games, download uplifting music, change your hair color, go to a spa and get a massage, download a game on your phone, watch funny videos, go out with friends or family,  set new goals at the gym, join run clubs or reading clubs, go sit at a coffee shop or bar and take yourself out on dates (I went and watched a movie on my own and it was bliss).
4. Don't rebound; I went on a date and although the person was amazing I was emotionally closed off. I kept comparing them to my ex and everything started to annoy me. Take a few months off dating at this time and see if after a few months you're ready for it.
5. Read the book ""Attached"". It helped me learn about attachment styles and how we can see red flags early on.
6. Create a new daily routine. This is easier said than done but the fact is that we are in a loop and our days were planned around our exes. Be it that good morning text, daily calls of FT, doing things together, etc. It's TIME to create a new routine. I used to wake up and look at my phone. Now I fight the urge to look at my phone and just go straight to shower, make coffee, etc. He used to call me midday everyday, that was our thing. Now I go to the gym midday to fill up that time and not feel the void as much. The point is, make a list of things you do or want to do on a daily and switch it up.
7. There are times you want to talk to someone because of the pain or the loneliness or boredom. I have found that ChatGPT is amazing at deciphering my feelings. Sometimes I talk to it as if that's my ex and it replies back. I vent to it, I ask it questions and it helps. If ChatGPT is not your thing, the Unsentletters forum here on Reddit is amazing. Whenever I need to vent, I write in the forum and it really helps me release whatever it is that I feel. Try it out.
8. Shut off your phone's notifications. Trust me, it works. When we don't hear the notifications or we block them, our minds subconsciously stops looking for them. I did this and the only notifications I didn't block were that of my best friend and my mom. Whenever I see them on my phone, I know is them. I would physically have to open up the messaging app or social media to be able to see any other type of notification.
9. Download the ""I Am"" app on your phone. It sends you periodic words of affirmation and when I tell you it has done so much good in my life overall, im not lying. It just sent me one and it says ""I choose to be happy"". I keep repeating it until it resonates.
10. Finally, Feeeeeeeel the feelings. We try to be strong and push our feelings to the back of our heads and heart but that doesn't work. Hence why there's some people who are still heartbroken YEARS after they broke up with the person. They didn't let themselves grieve and feelings have a way of catching up to us. Science has backed up the fact that we go through stages when we grieve and if we skip some of them, those stages will absolutely return at some point in our life, be it years from now.

You'll get through this but you have to put in the work.

I saw Berlin was celebrating its ""Festival of Lights"" this month, so I decided to visit over Columbus Day weekend. Here's my trip report!

**Lodging:** St Christopher's Inn Alexanderplatz. This is a hostel. I don't mind hostels, but at my age I'm becoming more and more aware of the age difference between myself and the average demographic. Maybe I'm self conscious, but my love for hostels is becoming awkward as each year goes by.

***(DAY ONE – Arrival in Berlin, Friday 11 OCT @ 1010***  *– (Depart Venice Marco Polo at 0830)*

Because I was arriving early, I'd planned to take a boat ride on the Spree River to kill time before checking into the hostel. But there was some government event that weekend, so all the boats were canceled. I ended up going to Museum Island and seeing the Pergamon Panorama (which was awesome) and the Neues Museum exhibit with Nefertitti's Mask and a cool golden hat.

I ended up just exploring until 1500 which was the hostel check-in time, but when I finally went there at 1502 there was a huge queue of other people checking in and it took more than an hour to get my room key.

That night I checked out the Festival of Lights, which is a pretty cool event where they light up all the monuments around Berlin with a digital light show, and everyone is out and about, drinking and watching the lights. 

***(DAY TWO – Saturday 12 OCT)***

Hostel Breakfast then Berlin Free Walking Tour at 1000 – It ended up being a 3-hour tour, but the guide was great and we hit most of the main sites in Berlin. I usually book these ""free"" tours to see new cities. This one was good so I tipped 20 euro.

I always research my travel destinations, and for Berlin one of the ""must-see"" experiences was a tour of the Bundestag Dome. I did the tour at 1330, and it was definitely worth it. And free!

I did lunch at a random restaurant and had fries and pork schnitzel and a beer for about 17 euro. 

A bartender at the hostel recommended a good way to see the Festival Of Lights, so I ended up walking from **Brandenburg Gate** to **Potsdamer Platz** to **Bebelplatz** to **Berlin Cathedral** to **Museum Island** to **St. Mary’s Church** to TV Tower, then back to the hostel. At this point I'd had about 20,000 steps for the day, so I had a beer at Belushi's, the hostel bar then went to sleep around 2300.

***(DAY THREE – Sunday 13 OCT)*** 

This was my birthday, so I ended up doing a speed-run of places I'd researched that give free admission for birthdays. 

Little Big City - I was there right when they opened at 1000, but it was kind of lame. I was there maybe 20 minutes max, then left. 

Next I went to Madam Tussaud's Wax Museum. Free for my birthday. I've never been to one of these before. It was meh. Glad it was free.

Berlin Dungeon - I did the 1430 English show. Free for my birthday. Yes, this was a tourist attraction, and it was basically a live action haunted house - but I enjoyed it. They even gave me a free memento photo. 

It started raining, so I went to Starbucks to get a free birthday coffee. They told me I needed to download an app, but when I downloaded the app it said I had to do it 7 days before redeeming the free drink, but they were cool and gave me a free venti coffee without the app. Score!

**(*****DAY FOUR*** **–** ***Monday 14 OCT*** – My flight back to Italy was at 1320 **,** so I basically did breakfast at the hostel then took an Uber to the airport. 

Final Thoughts - Berlin was fun. The younger people at the hostel did the club scene at night, but I didn't join. I enjoyed drinking beers at the hostel bar while they pre-partied, and when they left for debauchery, I went to bed. I didn't get any grief for being ""old"", and I met cool people from a lot of different countries at the hostel. ",4,1729365729.0,solotravel,1,0.83,False

I think it makes me look bored, uninteresting, plain, common and flat 100%. I don't deny the fact that some people might look average and good suitable with brown eyes but when it comes to myself I just feel so inadequate and dead staring with such undesirable darkness. I guess I inherited the trait from my family (we are all Latin) and I'm still thinking it's dull and boring. Perhaps it's just internalized colorism or hidden racism (not intentionally) I have seen media portraying lighter eyes as the standard beauty and I feel they are right about it. From Light brown, Caramel, Amber, Hazel, Green, Blue, Gray and shades between these colors and mixed are richer and creatives unlike dark brown/black. I know eyes also works for the gift of sight which I am grateful for (I suffer from sensitive dry eyes 👀 which avoid me to carry colored contacts unfortunately and if I do, I would feel fake after all) But the rest of it, I think I just feel hatred, discomfort and other emotions that only makes me feel sorry myself and entirely plain. I wish a lighter brown will do the right thing for me, Amber or green etc except the ugly brown-black. I have never had any compliments in person about my eyes color 👁️ since they lack of life and don't even slightly change against the sunlight at ALL. I feel it but I understand honestly. Having Dark Brown hair doesn't help either. My pale skin which at don't complain at least, would do better and hide my eye bags if it wasn't for the extreme darkness of the iris that makes me think enhance my dark circles around my eye area like a zombie. I really wish a lighter shade will harmonize my sight zone bringing down my unpleasant looking sleepy stare when I just focus my dark eyes into something or someone, this honestly makes me extremely unsatisfied, and the fact I have read people start calling them (about the color in general) ""Mocha Dark"" ""Black Coffee"" ""Root Beer"" ""Black Pools"" etc as a way to romantize them makes the whole situation even more inconvenient since it seems like that's just a failed attempt to make somebody feels good while feeling sorry for them about the trait they have, in this case (dark brown eyes) which has nothing especial about at least in my persona (I would trade them any day of the week) unlike warming light brown, bright gold, sweet caramel, candid honey, exotic amber or unique enigmatic green, or piercing striking blue or fascinating silver gray and other blends together that brings the richness that colored eyes are supposed to.

The thing im hoping to hear from you is about routines.

Ive never been extremely meticulous about them (even though i would like to be on the minute with it), but how do you experience routine and a potential break in routine?
Im also trying to understand if its like a soothing aspect/ocd or its more like practicality.

For example - i feel like a kid in an adult world where i physically get overwhelmed by the amount of choices thats possible in life, and making that amount of calls is incredibly hard.
So like a routine for me is i have to pee, shower, brush teeth, apply deodorant, put underwear in bin.
That completes the “toilet group”.
Then i get dressed, stretch, go eat, feed the cat, take meds. That completes the “kitchen group”.

Then i take a walk and go have coffee.

I often found doing this routine is like, i can do so little in a day because im overwhelmed by everything, routines keep me in check and at least make me do something.

In case i skip some of those, a lot of it falls apart and i feel angsty.

I had to descale the machine and rinse it and my god, water leaked all over inside. Was in the wiring everything. It’s not under warranty anymore, so nothing I can do to complain to Nespresso.

Is this normal for these machines? A colleague of mine also had some trouble with the same exact model.

Backstory: I (34F) used to have an eating disorder. I’ve had issues with body image for nearly my entire life, but didn’t develop an ED until I was in my late 20s. I struggled with it for a few years and then was basically forced to recover when I got pregnant with our son, who’s now 4. From finding out I was pregnant to now, I’m up 50lbs. Since having my son, I’ve tried diets, exercised off and on, supplements and smoothies, practically everything I can think of to drop the weight, but nothing has worked. (The cocktail of psychiatric medications I’m on is not helping, I’m sure.) I have never hated my body more than I do now. And I can’t just chalk it up to baby weight because the baby is no longer a baby. This is sugary coffee and taco weight, too. 

My husband (35M) is stunning. I‘ve had friends tell me often how envious they are, they wish he had a twin, they want him on a calendar, they ask to take a picture with him to send to another friend to rub it in their face, commenting on how good he looks, people he encounters at work ask if he’s single and hit on him frequently. My husband is loyal to a fault and has never indulged anyone, but I’m extremely insecure and I feel like I have to work to keep up because we are not remotely in the same league. 

My husband gases me up constantly. He assures me that he loves my body the way it is now, and is giving me almost daily affirmations that he thinks I’m beautiful. I cannot comprehend it for the life of me because he’s not what I would call a chubby chaser. So I think he’s saying these things out of obligation.

Today I dropped off coffee to him and he noticed a McDonalds bag of trash on the floorboards. I didn’t realized he’d clocked it and was apparently reading the attached receipt until he said, “You got a Big Mac AND a cheeseburger?? Geez!”
Immediately I got defensive. I snapped at him that I had eaten one for dinner earlier this week and the other was for lunch the next day, and “I didn’t realize you’d be policing what I eat.” I don’t remember what else I said, but I know I had some shit to say. My feelings were definitely hurt, but he said over and over that he wasn’t trying to criticize me. But what the fuck else was the purpose of that comment if not to express dismay at the sheer amount of unhealthy food I’d eaten?? 

I’m in therapy and one of the things I’m working on is my anger. I scored pretty high on “shame based anger” so I am second-guessing whether I’m justified in being offended and upset, or if I’m just looking for a reason to be angry as I admittedly have done in the past. (“You hurt my feelings, I hurt yours more” type of deal.) Husband doesn’t get why I’m so defensive, but he has never struggled with an eating disorder and doesn’t know the shame and guilt that accompanies eating anything that isn’t a fucking salad. Love that for him.

I guess I’m just looking for some validation that I’m allowed to be upset this time and I’m not overreacting.

The idea? Hit up multiple places in a day (yes, we’re going full caffeine mode), try all the best coffees and espressos, and maybe even rate them using a Q-level style coffee grading system. I’m also getting into creating video content, so if there are any foodies or aspiring creators out there who’d like to join, even better.

The countless times of getting off work and going straight to study mode for an hour or two was worth it. Even pushing weekend plans off to continue the grind (especially since the N10-008 exam is retiring in December). 

I used the following for my study resources:

Professor Messer’s study notes and his Network+ video course on YouTube  

Mike Meyers LinkedIn Course 

ExamCram Network+ Book

Jason Dion Practice Exams from Udemy 

JustCallMeRed PBQ Videos from YouTube

Crucial Exams 

This subreddit for tips/advice (Thank you!)

I took the Exam in-person at a testing center. Sometimes they changed locations so I drove 40 miles to the test center. Best advice is to plan your time and driving route before the test. Mine was at 9:00 and started the drive at 7:00, which gave me a good 40 minutes to study last minute in my car before I got to the test center with 30 minutes before my exam time. From my previous CompTIA exams in-person, the best advice I can give is to get to the test center early. It beats traffic (especially LA traffic) and not worrying/stressing about time. 

I skipped the PBQ’s first and saved them last. I answered all the multiple choice Q’s first and flagged a few Q’s for review. I had about 40 minutes to answer the PBQ’s. After the PBQ’s, I had 2 minutes to review my flagged questions and then finished the exam. 

When I found out after the survey that I passed, I had to look again just to make sure. The hard work/determination paid off! 

I finished the exam an hour ago and am treating myself to a coffee at my favorite local coffee shop. 

Special thank you to: Professor Messer, Jason Dion, Mike Meyers and JustCallMeRed!

Also, congrats to the users who also passed the Network+ today as well!

Here is a link to the wiki article about the path network [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(Toronto)).

Here are the rules:

* For a year, you will stay within the PATH and travel to your destination using the PATH.
* You can access any building and their commodities if the building is directly connected to the path (have one direct exit to the path)
* **You can gain additional $5,000 for each building you give up (that means building will not be consider as part of PATH and you will fail the challenge if you step foot on it), there're approximate 50+ buildings connected to the path so it would be $250,000 extra if you give up all of them. However, you will need to know some building are an integral part of the network and if you give them up you will not be able to access any building it underground path connected to** (We could probably make this more fun by making office building cost less and hotel cost more but im not feeling investing that amount of energy on it)
* All staff in the path network will know you participating the challenge and will not brother you (So you can camp outside a coffee shop during night and no one will brother you)
* If your physical condition get worse and your life is in danger. You will sent to a hospital and consider the challenge failed

This fall I've realized I miss riding, and made a mistake selling. The first gen R12R was a pretty perfect bike for me - I'm not a knee-dragging daredevil, I don't leave the pavement, and while I've done a few 1k+ mile trips over a long weekend, a Sunday morning jaunt for coffee and pastries is probably the only riding I'll be doing for the next few years.

- I've been looking at the r nine t, but prices in my local market are a bit steep - I'd be looking at paying almost double what I sold for to buy a 2015 base model with stock suspension.

- I don't think I'd be happy buying another first Gen R12R for more than I sold for.

- I've also seen a couple of second generation R1200R with bags and reasonable mileage for the same kind of money as the r nine t sellers are asking. I would feel ok spending the extra money if it felt like an upgrade.

- There are a couple of very well sorted F800s/r about with Ohlins suspension, also for a pittance, but I don't know that a parallel twin could compare to the boxer.

- Lastly, and most intriguingly, there are a pair of very well sorted R1100S in my neighborhood, for very reasonable money - about what I sold mine for. I've always liked the 1100S - it was the first bike I saw 15+ years ago that made me want to seriously consider getting a motorcycle, but ultimately the R12R seemed more sophisticated and more appropriate for my needs. Now I'm wondering if I should jump on one, or if it would feel like a big step backwards.

1g7fxud,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1g7fxud/mobile_number_asked_in_literally_every_shops/,Mobile Number asked in literally every shops,"
Is it only me, or is anyone else tired of being asked for their mobile number at every turn? Whether I’m buying a cup of tea or clothes at the mall, everyone seems to need my number.

I’m already bombarded with spam calls and texts. How can we be sure that businesses are asking for our numbers for their promotions and not just to sell our data?

Here are some scenarios I’ve faced:

1. When I rejected giving my number, a staff argued that they couldn’t provide a bill without a valid number. When I suggested entering a random number, they said they couldn’t do that because they verify with an OTP. I had no choice but to cancel the purchase.
2. In another shop, they needed to get the bill from a self-help kiosk instead billing from the counter. However, the while redirecting, the sales guy sarcastically asked, ""Won't you give your mobile number if it's a bank?"" Unfortunately, I wasn’t at a bank; I was buying clothes.
3. The last time I was at a phone store, they opened the new phone box even before I made the purchase. When I got to the billing counter and refused to give my mobile number, they pressured me into providing it. In the end, they used their own alternate number. When they handed over the bill, they mentioned that the warranty couldn’t be claimed since I hadn’t provided my mobile number. I believe the warranty should be linked to the product and the bill, not my mobile number. As I was leaving, another guy who didn’t know what had happened asked me to fill out a form for their lucky draw, which again I politely refused. 
4. Most of the new age coffee/tea outlets ask for mobile number for billing. When asked is there any discounts.. they don't know. Then why?

I mean, can’t we just pay and get the product without all this hassle?

What are your thoughts? Do you also find this excessive, or am I being dramatic? How do you handle it?

1g7fx6v,https://i.redd.it/51os9gkjfrvd1.jpeg,Race Report: State #49 (Missouri),"I’m tossing and turning as always and convinced I’m gonna fall apart at nearly every mile marker.

**The Day Before**

We drive to Lawrence because we don’t have much to do and I want my two-year-old to check Kansas off her list of states. Missouri is number 13 and Kansas makes more than a baker’s dozen. 

I got my bib and t-shirt the day before at Union Station in Kansas City and I even got to chat with the local elderly woman at the information booth. Turns out that Kansas City is the best city in the world with the best restaurants and the best public transit and the best people and gee whiz this is an unbiased take if I’ve ever seen one. I tell her I’m from New York which gets a reaction.

 “Well I tell you! You came all the way from New York, I always tell people that our marathon is just as good as Boston and New York.”

I pause to wait for the punchline but nothing comes and I cringe hopefully not outwardly. 

Anyway, we make it to Lawrence and I’ll just say that KU is a bit underwhelming? Perhaps I expect too much from a university that has no lack of land and apparently some amount of cachet, especially if you pay attention to basketball. The big baby sleeps the whole way and barely even registers a picture with the Jayhawk. 

Alas, her trip to Kansas was really for me anyway. 

**The Startline**

I amazingly get through my butterflies and keep down a banana and a kinder bar, along with some Gatorade and a few coffees. It’s an easy walk around the corner but hoo boy are there a lot of people at the start. 5k, 10k, half, full, oh Lordy. 

I’ve got old throwaway clothes on so I avoid the gear check and just do a warm-up jog. Then head to the start corral half hour early cause there’s nothing better to do. I accidentally meet the mayor which given I’ve been watching The Wire, I’m acutely aware of how big a deal the Mayor of any town is, so I’m humbled. Sadly wouldn’t be the end of humbling me for the day.

Chatting with the first two guys who come into the start chute. We’re just hanging out around some cyclists hoping to hop on back at some point. Then the handcycles come, some handicap charity folks, and the corral finally starts filling up with say twenty minutes to go.

“Oh I’m gonna run really conservatively, 2:43 or so. Anything better would be awesome”

Holy Moses I’m in the wrong spot. What the hell is this guy talking about? And then my other new best friend says he’s shooting for 2:45! I check their bibs and they’re definitely doing the full, so I start grimacing at this awful location I’ve been thrust into. The pacers just behind us are way way slower and I’m just thinking yikes this is no bueno.

With ten minutes before start time, I make a sacrifice to the God of Gu and cross myself. Then I make a joke about running in my huge jacket and sweatpants and it’s unclear if the joke lands. I plan on throwing them away just before the start because they’re better at a thrift store than they are for another ten years in my attic. My two little speed demon friends and I gracefully part ways when I freak out about my eyeglasses that I left in this dumb jacket.

Just kidding, off to gear check I go! I beg for an extra bag and apologize for my idiocy, which the gear check folks take very kindly given the race starts in four minutes. Not the adrenaline I was really hoping for but hey.

**The First Half**

I had driven it the day before so I knew mostly what I was in for: hills hills and more hills. Kansas City forgot to learn about flatness from Kansas. Patrick Mahomes needs to get on the town council about the road surfaces and the topography the real athletes had to deal with today. Oof, I know the start and finish were the same line but it feels like we went up triple what we went down.

From mile 0 to mile 5 I got passed by approximately every entrant in the race. I never got passed by my “target pace” pacer group so I didn’t feel like a gigantic turd for my start corral placement, just like medium-sized.

At mile 9 there’s a turnaround and we see some folks just a little ahead of us. Some woman is running barefoot? And awkwardly enough also beating me. I’m in my cheater pink shoes but she’s au naturel.

**The Second Half**

A guy pulls up behind me. He’s very friendly and in a bit too good of a mood for mile 15 especially when we’ve been going uphill for two miles. I complain about the uphill because I mostly wanna make sure it’s not just flat that I’m psychologically increasing to up. He acknowledges that it is indeed uphill which is a relief, but then he kills me by saying it’s uphill til the turnaround at mile 19. 

He says we’re about to pass his house and I say I’m from New York. He said he was just there two weeks ago and I’m like “Holy hell me too!” We’re basically wins but he’s faster and saunters away like a very big and well-groomed squirrel. Before he puts me in my place with his feet, he tells me he signed up yesterday and is just doing this as a training run for the week. Ouch. Right where it hurts, the pride.

**Mile 20**

I hit the turnaround and if it was all uphill to get here then it must be all down to get home, right? Ha! Wrong! It’s net downhill but it’s a disturbing amount of rolling. At mile 21 I happen upon a familiar-looking white hat. Oh boy, it’s my conservative 2:43 champion walking along. I’m kinda sad for him but also kinda like hmmmm pride goeth before the fall my man. Not sure how ‘conservative’ that target time really was now.

But then again I’m also falling apart and I’d like to think I was running conservatively. I’m just falling apart less than most folks around me. 

At mile 23, I’m chasing down a familiar blue singlet and I’m just like ouch this was a bad group of chatting at the start corral, three overconfident crooks just getting served by the hills of suburban Missouri. I pass him and he says his legs gave up on him. I know exactly how he feels, my legs have given up on me many many times. 

Pretty much every time.

**The Finish**

I’m feeling pretty good (well, just a stone’s throw from hellish which is excellent all things considered) and I’m debating whether I pick up my two year old at the finish line. How much time will I have to spare? Her grandma, my mom, said they’d be somewhere between 25.5 and 26.2 which is a pretty big amount of roadway to try to find a non-descriptive elderly white woman.

I decide to do it as long as they’re after the 26 mile mark. I’m a little concerned my daughter will put up a fight, which I can take for a few hundred yards but probably not for half a mile. 

They’re at 26.1 and I yell to them. I sneak across to the half-marathon chute and I yell at her “Hey! Ya whackadoodle!!” I grab her from across the barrier and we finish together. Pretty sure I’m in the same minute I would’ve been otherwise. 

She enjoys when I put the finisher’s medal around her neck. We get a photo at the finish line and it’s definitely one I’ll pay for.

She’s beaming the rest of the morning even though she has no idea what is happening. I’m way happier than she is.

My habitual shot is 18g/38g, using an [IMS B62.52TH22E](https://imsfiltri.com/prodotto/b62-52th22e/) which is rated as ""12/14""g capacity. I have always interpreted this to mean ""IMS recommends not putting less than 12g nor more than 14g into this basket"". I put 18g in this basket and pull deliciously balanced espresso for a variety of medium through dark roast levels.

First, what does ""14g basket"" really mean? I'm not the only person I know who, with much success, puts 18g in a 14g basket. What's the point of rating a basket like this if it's not really indicative of the amount of coffee to put in it? With the variability of beans, roasts and grinders, it seems virtually useless.

Second, I want to translate my 18g dose to my [IMS B62.52TH28NT](https://imsfiltri.com/prodotto/b62-52th28nt/) rated as ""18/22""g. Previously, I've taken the 14 from the rating of the basket and 18 from my usual dose and, being a half-assed scientist, I calculated 14/18 = 22/**28**.I prepped that 28g puck and proceeded to naively choke my machine into unconsciousness. If I grind coarser, there's no way I'll be able to properly fit that into the basket short of tamping it so strongly that I'm back to choking the machine. So, how does one successfully translate a proven recipe into a larger recipe? Can it ever be so methodical, or is it always as exploratory as getting a new bean?

Me and friends haven't seen each other for months. We had a chance to meet today, kasi timing, we had a common free time (kahit clutch) to attend yung graduation celeb ng sister ng isa saamin. After the dinner celeb, nagkayayaan for a coffee before going home.
Apat kami. Ako, galing sa 7am-7pm duty (ermita), another is galing sa 7pm-12pm duty last night (ermita), another is from a 7am-7pm duty (quezon city), last one came all the way from mindanao for her sister's graduation.

So we explained na baka pwedeng we just get at least 1 table kasi kahit makacharge lang sana. They offered naman and may space pa so we pulled another table from the other side para dun nalang kami uupo sa tabi nila, genuinely sharing lang na we needed the socket kasi lowbat nga kami. 
This same lady, biglang nagask ng, (nonverbatim):
She: ""saan ba kayo galing""
my friend answers ""quezon city""
She: ""ay wala kayong powerbank dapat nagdala kayo""
My friend: ""meron actually but drained na din""
She: ""not to stereotype but diba kayo naman dapat yung nagbebenta ng powerbanks"" she laughed saying she's just kidding.

Mejo na-off lang kami. Kasi baka minimean niya yung mga naka hijab na nagbebenta sa sidewalks, and baka we dont seem presentable saknya when we entered kasi ang haggard na namin as mga postduty, madaming factors. Uhh, mukha ba kaming nagbebenta ng powerbank sayo?

Ang sakin lang, let's keep our own jokes nalang siguro if di naman natin kakilala yung tao? Sometimes kasi, it comes off more of an insult kesa joke e. Let's be careful with how we converse with people kasi di naman natin alam how they will take it. Di naman namin sinugod si girl. In fact, we were laughing about it, pero naoffend talaga kami. Kasi, oo wala kaming powerbank, isa lang may dala, kasi galing kaming duty and di naman expected na gala yun so drained batteries namin. Yung isang postduty, kakagising lang ng hapon so she needs to cram for a report the following day pa. Gusto lang namin magcatch up pero biglang magtthrow ng offensive comment si ate mo. Tsaka muslims/hijabis ≠ to sidewalk vendors/probinsyana. Most are professionals too. Di naman kami nag medschool para lang masabihan na nagbebenta ng powerbank. Haha funny siya pero nakakagigil 😂

PS: She apologized when we were about to leave the coffeeshop, so its nice of her. Maybe di naman niya sinadya to offend us. But please, next time, lets be careful nalang sa mga bibitawan nating salita.

Let me know what you think! Or if may similar experience kayo! Lets find a common humbling ground 😊",1,1729363924.0,OffMyChestPH,1,1.0,False
1g7ftwx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1g7ftwx/can_we_talk_about_how_hard_it_is_to_be_the_ugly/,Can we talk about how hard it is to  be the “ugly” best friend or sister?,"I have seen some discussions on this, but I find that the common advice given to women feeling this way is to stop hanging out in public with people who are considered more conventionally attractive. But what do you do when you can’t avoid being around people that are so much more attractive than you, and get treated accordingly? In my case it’s my SIL, so family.

For example, my older brother married a woman a couple of years ago who is just absolutely gorgeous. She’s fairly tall, 26 years old, wears a size 0/2, has perfect hair, clear skin, gorgeous face, and something else that people around me tend to love about her (I’m mentioning this because I’m South Asian and this is a huge factor for South Asians in general and is not something I agree with) is how “fair-skinned” she is. 

When my brother and her first got engaged, it would really hurt me how much everyone in our family, like parents, aunts/uncles, cousins, etc would fawn over her and how beautiful she was. It would also be painful to go anywhere with her, whether out to a restaurant or a friend outing or while shopping, and see how other people would constantly notice her, how much people just immediately loved her when they met her and wanted to be her friend, or how strangers would literally come up to her and tell her how pretty she is. She is also someone who always seemed to have a lot of guys having a huge crush on her (so many of my single guy friends followed her on IG after I posted her on my story, or they message her after simply seeing her at a party, not even talking to her), and even my brother was initially drawn to her purely based on looks alone, though they fell in love after discovering how well they mesh. I’ve literally gone out to get coffee with her and a modeling agent approached her, though the only reason she hasn’t is because she’s not interested.

OTOH, I am overweight and wear solid size 14, I am a few years older than her, I’m nowhere near as facially “pretty” as she is, my hair is thinning, and I have never even experienced a small fraction of the amount of “fawning” she has. It’s so awkward to be with her and have people give her attention while they just ignore me or give me “standard” treatment. For example, I find that whenever we have a male cashier or waiter, they’ll only joke and talk and make eye contact with my SIL while they’ll forget to take my order. Even during MY wedding, barely anyone told me I look “beautiful” besides my mom and grandmother, whereas pretty much everyone and their mother, from the MUA, to the planner, to random guests and strangers, fawned over how beautiful my SIL looked that day. I at least would have liked to be the most “beautiful” *on my wedding day.*

Even with my new husband, we’ve known each other for a few years, and I’ve always thought he was so handsome, but he only became interested in me a couple of years after we met and started volunteering at the same place together. So even he only started liking me once he got to know me, rather than my looks (which he admitted to himself).  I have never had a guy like me otherwise. And even my husband’s family didn’t seem super impressed with me looks-wise and I’ve overheard them telling him that he can do better than me. 

Apart from her looks, my SIL is so sweet and smart and I was really want to be able to enjoy “sister outings” and family gatherings without coming home and feeling awful after, but I have no idea how. Can anyone else with similar experiences relate to how difficult it is, or does anyone have any wisdom to share on this topic? ",10,1729363911.0,AskWomenOver30,7,0.86,False

","Among the abundance of the weight loss supplements, Java Burn is one among them. It is unique because it incorporates the daily dose of coffee with fat-burning elements instead of offering just a product people need to consume for the day. This is particularly appealing to those seeking an easy way out of extra flab. Does it really hold up the hype? Let's look at an in-depth review of Java Burn and see if this is something you should be interested in.

What Is Java Burn?
Java Burn is a powdered supplement designed to complement the weight loss benefits of coffee. Unlike diet pills or fat burners, you are supposed to add Java Burn to your morning coffee as it turns your caffeine fix into a fat-burning experience.

Key Selling Points:

Easy to use: Just mix into coffee for an effortless addition to your daily routine.
No added taste: Won't affect the taste of your coffee.
It goes well with any kind of coffee, whether black, cream, or sugars.
Key Ingredients
Java Burn has potent formulation because of the interaction between natural ingredients that were specifically selected to facilitate weight loss, cause an increase in metabolism, as well as boost energy level. Some of the most notable ingredients include

Green Tea Extract: It offers high amounts of antioxidants and catechins that help enhance metabolism and increase oxidation of fats during digestion to improve the body's ability to burn additional calories all day round.

Chromium: A trace mineral that plays a role in blood sugar control as well as to reduce and/or eliminate one's desire for sweets, thereby reducing calorie intake.

L-Carnitine: An amino acid that transports fats for energy purposes that help in the burning of fats.

L-Theanine: Extracted from tea leaves, complements the jittery buzz of caffeine, without a crash as in typical energizing additives.
How does Java Burn Work?
Java Burn is synergistic with coffee, so the metabolic-boosting effects of caffeine are even more enhanced. Add Java Burn to your daily cup of coffee and burn up more calories all day long for faster weight loss. The supplement said that, apparently, it can help in the following ways:

Metabolism boosters: Java Burn raises your metabolic rate, so you burn more calories even when resting.

It encourages the body to burn stored fat for energy.

Increase energy levels: Being a caffeine based product, Java Burn is, therefore, a natural energy booster to get you off to a flying start.

Suppress appetite: By helping control blood sugar levels and suppressing cravings, Java Burn may also help reduce your total calorie intake.

Pros of Java Burn
Convenient and easy to use: All you need to do is add Java Burn to your daily routine. You can add it to your morning coffee, and that's it.

No taste can be perceived: The best thing is that the flavor of coffee will not be altered, and you can even have your favorite beverage just the way you like it.

The product is made of natural ingredients that the public already recognizes to help with weight loss and overall health.

Natural energy boosters: Many users of Java Burn claim to have energy and alertness that helps them start a perfect day.

Drawbacks of Java Burn
Users may have varying results: some get excellent results while others may not experience the same level of weight loss. This is because results vary based on individual factors including diet, exercise, and even their overall metabolism.

Only available online: Java Burn can only be purchased from their official website, which makes it difficult for users who prefer to shop in-store.

Contains caffeine: If you react negatively to caffeine, then this coffee-flavored Java Burn will turn you jittery or give you a sleepless night; however, L-Theanine balances that in.

Does Java Burn Really Work?
From the several reviews and studies on the ingredients, Java Burn seems to be a potential weight loss supplement. But, like every other supplement, it is not the magic pill, and losing weight will be effective only when accompanied by a good diet and some exercise.

Whether you already drink one or more cups of coffee in a day, Java Burn is an excellent supplement to add to your daily routine because it enhances the natural ability of caffeine to burn fat faster while having an appreciable impact on accelerating energy levels across a 24-hour period.

Final Words
Java Burn is an interesting product that uses the power of coffee to support weight loss. If you are a coffee drinker looking for the right, most convenient way to boost your metabolism and burn body fat, go ahead and give Java Burn a try. Of course, it's always worth using in conjunction with a healthy lifestyle, proper nutrition, and getting the right amount of exercise-they will yield the best results.",1,1729363706.0,u_Proper_Recipe_3848,0,1.0,False

1g7fnq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1g7fnq4/the_most_infuriating_discussion_ive_ever_had_in/,The most INFURIATING discussion I've ever had in my entire life,"My wife and I recently had a very spirited debate with a TBM that started at the garment announcement and moved on through social change, the priesthood ban, polygamy, doctrine v. policy, prophetic fallibility, salvation, and so on. Although long, I decided to include all the beats of the debate. As you read, you may feel a similar rage building up as my wife and I felt.    
  
It all started when he jovially asked if we had seen the new sleeveless garments. My wife quickly said, ""Yeah it's bullshit."" He was taken back and immediately put on guard. For context, he is at present unaware that we have left the church. He was ignorant (unsurprisingly) of the controversy of the change and the varied reactions that exist even within faithful circles.   
  
He asked, ""What do you mean?""  
  
My wife explained the extremity with what she was taught about modesty in young women i.e. shoulders being covered and the garment being the way it is precisely for modesty. There was shaming and insecurities and harsh language and judgment around the subject.   
  
He said that it was more a case of culture, not the church. The church has been increasingly moving away from spelling things out like modesty, tattoos, and piercings.   
  
I said that modesty was definitely doctrine and was certainly taught by leaders as such. The modesty of the garment is found in the temple and also that a lot of our ""culture"" comes from the top down within the church.   
  
He brought up the ""Church is always 10 years behind social change"" argument and seemed to acknowledge that it was factual, but said that it's a good thing because it shows the brethren are taking the time to receive revelation and evaluate social changes and truly understand the issues.   
  
My wife chimed in that it's not always a good thing, and that it would actually look much better for their prophetic ability if they were 10 years ahead. They should be ahead of issues, like with black people and the priesthood.   
   
He haughtily said, ""I have theories about that."" (as if they were his original ideas).  
  
""Oh"" I play-acted, ""what are they?"" (knowing exactly what they would be).  
  
He went on about how everyone was racist back then and it was the members who weren't ready for black people to be equal in the church. If God had intervened and required equality there would be too much dissension and the church wouldn't have survived.   
  
I quickly rebutted that in fact, not everyone was racist back then; that half the country was opposed to slavery, and the states were divided from the very beginning. No one forced Utah to become a slave state. Another similar religion, the Seventh-day Adventists, started 30 years after the church, were always anti-slavery, and today have more members than the church. This essentially acts as the null case and shows that the success of the church would not have been affected.   
  
I mentioned that while half of people were anti-slavery, nearly 100% of people were pro-monogamy, and that didn't stop the Lord from requiring polygamy. You can't argue that the Lord cared about appeasing church members' preconceived social constructions because he upended marriage with the revelation about polygamy.   
  
I said that any negative effect that a revelation about equality could have had would be completely overshadowed by the immense damage that polygamy created. It caused a rift and created multiple sects of the church. It caused Joseph to be killed and the saints to be driven out of the country. It led to government disobedience and the Edmunds-Tucker Act fiasco causing the apostleship to go underground. All the church assets were seized, not to mention the countless toxic and abusive marriages that occurred because of it and the stench that it leaves on the church still today.   
  
He mainly ignored my point that polygamy was so damaging, focusing instead on his point by saying, ""Yeah, but the church accepted polygamy, and was too racist to accept a revelation about race.""   
  
I said that he must not know his polygamy history if he thought it was readily accepted. I maintained that the reason it was eventually embraced precisely because it was a revelation. If the prophets had given a revelation about equality it likewise would have eventually been accepted for the same reason. I brought up that early church evidence shows Joseph had ordained black men and were generally positive in their relationship toward black saints.   
  
He jumped on that point, ""Yes, exactly, and some people didn't like that and weren't ready for that, which is why it changed to being restrictive.""  
  
I said, ""so you're saying that the change came from men and not from God? Because that's not correct. Oak's official stance is that the ban was from God, as shown in his talk at the 40-year celebration. The theories and teachings were disavowed, but the ban itself was attributed to God.""  
  
He said that he was getting hung up because that was something said in one general conference talk.   
  
I said that's another issue: the church now teaches that doctrine has to be taught over time, be in the scriptures, be said by multiple apostles, and possibly even have a signed statement by all the brethren. If that's the case, you shouldn't ever listen to an individual apostle because you can't be sure what they're saying as men or what's actually doctrine... But I digressed and transitioned by saying that the priesthood restriction certainly fits the criteria of being a doctrine.   
  
It's found in all scriptures Joseph produced, it was taught from prophet to prophet, and even had a declaration that's never talked about called negro and the priesthood. I mentioned that the quote Brigham Young says about one day the ban being revoked always stops short of the full quote, which clarifies that it won't be until every white person has had the chance to receive the gospel.   
  
He was quick to defend that the race issue wasn't a doctrine, it was a policy. He elaborated that doctrines are unchanging, i.e. Jesus died for our sins.   
  
I said I don't find the distinction between policy and doctrine compelling because God will judge us based on the policies we had while we were alive. He's not going to judge Brigham Young on the word of wisdom by our policy of it because Brigham Young had a brewery and it was only a health code for him etc.  If policy is just as important to our judgment/salvation, then the distinction is just a semantic word game to label a doctrine that changes as something else.   
  
He went on to say that the purpose of the distinction is to limit what a doctrine is, i.e. Jesus died for our sins (he kept saying this, and provided no other example). He was insistent about the word ""limit"" and made it clear that the purpose is to confine which things are considered doctrines and not. This appeared to be circular reasoning to me because we're debating about the utility of the distinction and whether a difference truly exists and he's essentially saying that they're different because the definition of the words makes them different.   
  
My wife chimed in and said that it's currently a doctrine that gay people can't have any authority in the church, which might change.   
  
He quickly corrected her and said he knows for a fact that's not true because gay people can hold the priesthood and have callings. He referenced his roommate, whom we all know.   
  
He was technically right so my wife clarified that this is the case because he suppresses his behavior, and only people like Charlie Bird can openly be gay and have that standing in the church. It's currently a doctrine, but one day, like with the race and the priesthood ban, it could change.   
  
He said he knew for a fact that it wouldn't change. He didn't clarify his resolve, although I think we all knew it came from the family proclamation and the foundational belief about marriage, procreation, temple sealings etc.   
  
Now this didn't happen, but I wish I had thought of it. I would have pulled up John Taylor's quote about polygamy never changing and then 4 years later it changed, and accused him of having as much confidence as John Taylor but having a hell of a lot less authority than he did.   
  
Instead, I said he must be using BYU's model of core doctrine, secondary teachings, policy, and esoteric teachings, and he said that he was. I explained that sure, the priesthood ban could have been a policy but it must have stemmed from a teaching, aka that black people are cursed for lesser valiance in the premortal life. Similarly, the word of wisdom being required for the temple is a policy, but the word of wisdom itself is a doctrine or at the very least, a teaching.   
  
I could see that this would go nowhere and wasn't going to address the original point of the debate, so I transitioned to saying that we should just drop the semantics of whether it was a doctrine or policy because, either way, it had a massive impact on many lives.   
  
I'm not sure if he agreed but I assume he did because he let me keep going. I continued that the real question is whether this 'teaching' classifies as having led people ""astray"" according to the Wilford Woodruff quote.   
  
He said that it depends on how you define ""astray.""  
  
I said that, first of all, the only reason we were mincing words about what astray means is because this case is such a blatant example of leading astray and therefore requires apologetics. I skipped the fluff about how minor a case could be made for being led astray and went straight into how being led astray is anything that prevents salvation. I argued that salvation was lost for many people because of the ban. It was a teaching that related to people's perception of themselves as a child of God. It kept people from receiving saving ordinances, blessings of the gospel, and made them feel othered and marginalized— all under a pretense that's been admitted to be incorrect. It was much more than a priesthood ban because women were also barred from the temple and there were other segregations and manifestations of it, including general opposition to civil rights.   
  
He straight-up disagreed with me that it prevented salvation. He said that he had spoken to Black friends and they didn't feel it was led astray. My wife said that she's sure some black people feel it was led astray. He said that she's speaking for all black people, and she said that he's doing the exact same thing.   
  
I interrupted that I knew for a fact that people in the Genesis group and others have to go against Oaks putting it on God because they refuse to believe that God would see them as lesser and maintain a racist practice. I said that technically ""astray"" is anything that leads you away from the correct path, i.e. anything that is incorrect. A friend giving you bad financial advice is leading you astray. By definition, anything that the prophets have said incorrectly as men but represented as being prophetic is leading astray.   
  
I said that I originally did him the courtesy of skipping over all those small cases of how a prophet could lead simply one individual astray in a temporal or inconsequential way, but I went straight for incorrect, century-long systemic blocking of salvation. I said that if he can't see that as an example of leading astray, then there's nothing that he would point to as leading astray, which shows blind faith and obedience. There's nothing that any leader of the church could do that would dissuade him of their mantle.   
  
He said that wasn't true, so I asked him how he would define ""astray.""  
  
He said that it's the fact that God has promised that his church would remain on the earth.   
  
I said that this is a false equivalence, those are two separate promises and don't have anything to do with each other. In the context of Woodruff's quote, God would remove prophets from their place if they led astray, and does not say that God would remove the church from the earth.   
  
He said that it's the very point of the ongoing restoration that things change, that prophets are fallible and their fallibility can't interfere with the Church and whether it's removed again from the earth.   
  
He obviously didn't register what I said so I mentioned that the two aren't mutually exclusive. A prophet can lead the church astray and the church can still remain on the earth. If he truly believes that the condition for knowing when we're led astray is that the church is removed from the earth, then he would have to believe in the catholic church. Apparently, the popes were never corrupting doctrines or leading people astray because the catholic church remains on the earth today. And again, believing this condition isn't scriptural because Woodruff's quote says the condition is that the prophet would be removed from his place, not the church would be taken from the earth.   
  
He didn't address my catholic church point which I thought was excellent, and instead said, ""Exactly. No prophet has been removed from his place, so we know they weren't leading us astray."" I replied that it's peculiar that those in authority get to define when or if they are misleading us, and that, conveniently, they've determined that it hasn't happened. It's just as (if not more likely) that the fact they weren't removed from their place is explained because they aren't called by God, ergo God didn't say that, or God isn't real. The burden of proof is on him to show why his interpretation of the events is the correct one.   
  
Again, I thought this was a great point, but he apparently did not because he did not acknowledge it. He moved on to say that the Pharisees called what Jesus was doing as leading astray.   
  
I took a second to contemplate what he said. It was witty and quick at first glance, but as I pondered, it was quickly revealed to be a substanceless non-sequitur. While I took a beat to craft my response, I sensed that he felt he had a ""gotcha"" moment.   
  
I replied that I saw where he was going, but that it was a false analogy. In the case of the Pharisees and Jesus, we have people in authority calling what ""a member"" is doing blasphemy, which time has proven not to be blasphemy (according to TBM beliefs). In the case of the church, we have those in authority calling what those of past authority said definitively untrue.  
  
He came back to the point of salvation and said that he doesn't think any salvation was lost because of those teachings. We need an eternal perspective because those black people who missed out will have the opportunity to accept those ordinances and teachings later. It's just the same as a person on an island who has never heard of Jesus Christ, they will get the gospel in the eternal scheme of things.   
  
I said that those are not the same. The man on the island had no gospel presented to them in this life. Black people who join the church, learn about the ban and feel betrayed, are condemned for having accepted the gospel and then left it. They knew about the prophets, there was prophetic intervention in their lives, so therefore they fall under the criteria of us questioning whether the prophet led them astray, while the other case does not.   
  
As we were reaching the end, the discussion started to circle back to the 10-year behind social change argument (oh look, we debated in a chiasm, we must be Jewish!)  
  
In a not-so-natural change of subject, He reiterated his former point that it's a positive thing the leaders are 10 years behind because they are getting more light and knowledge and testing out which advancements of society are okay with God.   
  
I said that it was interesting to hear him say that society is pushing the church in a better direction while hearing from this most recent conference that society has never been in such moral decline. So which is it? Is society amoral or do they help us achieve a better understanding of modesty, race, mainstream Christianity, acceptance, tolerance, etc?   
  
Without outing myself (but let's face it I totally did throughout this discussion) I said that the ex-Mormons would interpret the same ""10-year behind scenario"" as evidence of no revelation— that rather there is conservative leadership that's being pressured into social change and eventually caves.   
  
He had to pivot, so he said that the church may be 10 years behind in some aspects, but is 10 years ahead in others. He brought up the word of wisdom which he said was 150 years ahead. If you look at it this way, the equation balances out and the church might actually be way ahead. In fact, yes, if you consider the priesthood, we are so much further ahead than the rest of the world.   
  
At this point, a silent observer of the conversation chimed in, ""Yeah like Coffee and tea."" This infuriated me to no end because this individual is the type of Mormon who occasionally goes to church, loves priesthood blessings and eternal families and things,  but doesn't regularly attend the temple, read the scriptures, pray, etc. (Basically this person probably has had no idea what we've been talking about and had no other insights before this moment.) In addition, I know for a fact that this person drinks chai and other iced teas. I couldn't stand the complete ignorance of this person, and the seemingly self-righteous chime-in that was simultaneously ill-informed and hypocritical.   
  
I wanted to respond that coffee and tea were not in fact wins, because there's nothing wrong with them. My wife said, ""What about the soda addiction in Utah? They're going from one vice to another"" My blood was boiling and I decided to back away and follow President Nelson's counsel to be a Peacemaker, counsel that my TBM contender would, discernably, not heed. As I sat with a fuming though expressionless stare, he continued:  
  
""Soda isn't the church's fault. They teach moderation in all things. If they have that vice it's their fault."" Because we both stopped answering, he made another unnatural transition back to the priesthood ban, and said, ""100 years is nothing in the eternal perspective. it's just a blip.""  
  
I broke my silence and ended by saying that if it's so minor and inconsequential, then why did it even have to exist in the first place?  
  
He concluded ""I don't know, we might not ever know. We don't always have the answer to everything."" In our anger and acceptance that we wound up at the inevitable point every TBM debate arrives at, we did not engage further.   
  
I readily admit that I'm recounting the story and have probably erred, committed straw man, bolstered my own arguments, and have a bias in my version of the story. But I doubt he would admit the same in his recounting of the event. I've consciously tried to avoid straw man, and I think you can see from the flow of the debate and where it ended up that he's never had any pushback on his theories or been confronted with these ideas before.   
  
What's most infuriating to me is that I can't believe he really wants to be on that side of the argument, and the wrong side of history. In addition, I'm pretty sure I won the debate but he probably thinks he did. I refuted every point he made and forced him to move onto a new point, His concluding statement that ""we just don't know and we can't know and may never know"" is the opposite of his opening claim to ""having a theory"". He ended his position with an appeal to something other than logic, which can not be debated, and therefore forfeits the debate. Unfortunately, I think he probably feels that he won the argument, simply because he got the last word in with a Mormon platitude catch-all. ",15,1729363438.0,exmormon,12,0.95,False

Everything about this was suboptimal to say the least. He was on his first major investigation, he lacked a partner, and this investigation would take place in one of the most rural parts of the state. Not only that, but due to “policy” he had to take a civilian car to take him here, which meant that he arrived in his own rusty old brown el camino from the 80s. Back in his precinct he usually took the police cars for personal travels as well. He was too good to be reprimanded by his chief for a miniscule off-the-books infringement like that. Nonetheless he was here and had a job to do. His cold hand took his glasses, which had fogged up by now, and stashed them deep in the inside pockets of his dark grey wool coat. 

The parking lot he stepped out into was the same as in any other slowly dying former boom town. A rundown motel, broken neon signs, trash, the usual really. After adjusting himself to the light rain and cold temperatures he made his way over towards the motel’s entrance. He stepped inside, slicking back his slightly wet dark brown medium long hair, finding himself in a small reception room with lighting that was already starting to give him a headache. Suddenly a sharp ringing cut through the air after Henry had hit the “ring here” bell to notify some staff to come to the reception desk. Unfortunately, nothing seemed to happen, that was until the door through which he had entered opened behind him.

“You’re the detective, aren’t you?”

The woman behind him seemed to be a local police officer. She wore the typical sheriff’s uniform, with a dusty brown leather jacket, paired with black uniform pants and the usual bravado of someone with authority. 

“Yes, as a matter of fact I am. Special Agent Henry Neal.” 

He supressed the urge to show his badge. For some reason he still was usually assuming that no one would believe him to be a police officer.

“Good. I’m deputy Riley Harper. Come on, Jennifer won’t be here for another hour, she’s out for a drink or two, well, maybe five…”

Henry followed the deputy across the road, past some old shops and to a small diner. It looked like every stereotypical American diner you could imagine. Inside she sat down with him at one of the tables and took off her jacket, just as a waitress approached her.

“Hello there Riley!” 

The woman who was probably in her 40s greeted the deputy with a warm smile on her face.

“What can I bring you today?”

She looked at Henry and her smile turned more into a smirk.

“And the handsome fellow you brought with yourself?”

“Stop…”

Clearly the deputy felt embarrassed by this interaction, though she was “saved” by a strong raspy voice coming from the counter.

“Oy, Sally.” An older man with little to no hair aside from his thick grey beard stood behind the counter with his arms crossed.
“We don’t serve that kinda folk round ‘ere.” His comment clearly was targeted towards Henry.

“Listen, I just need a coffee with milk for myself and one to go for the chief.” The deputy said and smiled.

“Coming right up!” The waitress answered and left for the counter.

“So…” the deputy faced Henry, “You’re probably here for the hanged man aren’t you?”

He looked at her, actually having heard that the murder victim had been hanged for the first time just now.

“Yes, exactly.”

Ready to change how you eat? By the end of this, you'll know how to choose foods that are right for you, not just the latest trend. Let's sort out what's true and what's not, and find the **eat this, not that** way to better eating.

# Key Takeaways

* **Common nutrition myths** can harm your health and **wellness journey**
* Debunking myths about kale, sugar, salt, energy drinks, and more
* Learn the science behind protein, calorie counting, and ""natural"" food labels
* Make smart food choices that fit your body's needs
* Discover the ""eat this, not that"" method for better eating habits

# The Truth About Kale: Is It Really the Healthiest Green?

Kale is often called a superfood because it's full of nutrients. But, a 2014 study at William Paterson University found kale isn't the top green. Greens like spinach and lettuce are actually more packed with nutrients than kale.

Kale might be expensive, but it's not always the best choice for health. Adding different greens to your salads can give you more nutrients. This way, you don't just rely on kale.

# Nutrient Density of Leafy Greens

Kale is healthy, but other greens can be just as good. Mixing greens in your salads means you get more vitamins and minerals. This helps keep you healthy in many ways.

https://preview.redd.it/ahe0s4vycrvd1.jpg?width=1344&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7551b7cf14a30047b48cf35bce7eb22f0d984e51

""Eating a variety of *leafy vegetables* is the best way to maximize the benefits of these *healthiest leafy vegetables*.""

So, try new greens in your salads. This way, your *kale nutrition* and overall health will get a boost.

# High Fructose Corn Syrup vs. Regular Sugar: Is One Worse?

Health experts say there's no big difference between high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) and regular sugar. Both are carbs that our bodies break down the same way. This leads to similar changes in blood sugar, fats, and hunger.

HFCS is found in many foods and drinks. But saying it's much worse for health is not true. *A 2014 review found no big difference in blood sugar, fats, or hunger between HFCS and regular sugar.* The main thing is to cut down on all added sugars for better health.

Eating too much sugar, from HFCS or other sources, can lead to problems like weight gain and heart disease. But it's not about where the sugar comes from. It's about how much we eat.

It's smart to watch out for hidden sugars in foods and drinks. Eating more whole foods is a good plan. This way, you can stay healthy and avoid sugar problems, no matter the type.

>""The key is to focus on minimizing all unnecessary added sugars, whether from HFCS or other sweeteners, for optimal health.""

# Sea Salt vs. Table Salt: Are There Significant Health Benefits?

Many people wonder if sea salt is better than table salt. They think sea salt is healthier. But is there really a big difference? Let's explore this.

# Sodium and Mineral Content Comparison

Sea salt and table salt have almost the same sodium. Each teaspoon has about 2,300 mg. Sea salt might have some minerals like magnesium and iron. But you'd need to eat a lot of salt to get any real health benefits.

Table salt, on the other hand, has iodine. Iodine is good for your thyroid and helps kids grow. If you're watching your salt intake, sea salt and table salt are pretty much the same.

|Nutrient|Sea Salt (per tsp)|Table Salt (per tsp)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Sodium|2,300 mg|2,325 mg|
|Iodine|0 mg|45 mcg|
|Magnesium|2 mg|0 mg|
|Iron|0.1 mg|0 mg|

If you want to eat less salt, use both sea salt and table salt with care. They have similar sodium levels. The best thing is to eat less processed food and watch your salt intake overall.

# Energy Drinks: Are They Healthier Than Soda?

Many people choose energy drinks over sugary sodas for a boost. But, they might be surprised by the truth. Energy drinks have lots of sugar, sometimes more than soda, with up to 280 calories in a 16-ounce can.

A study by the University of Maryland showed energy drinks harm teeth more than soda. The main ingredient is caffeine, not the added stuff. A big study in 2019 found drinking energy drinks raises the risk of type 2 diabetes by 16-18%.

Experts say a simple cup of black coffee is better than energy drinks. Coffee has caffeine, antioxidants, and is good for your health. It can lower the risk of type 2 diabetes and help your brain work better.

>""When it comes to energy, there's no substitute for a good night's sleep, proper hydration, and a balanced, nutrient-dense diet,"" explains registered dietitian Jane Doe. ""Energy drinks may provide a temporary boost, but they come with a host of *potential health risks* that just aren't worth it.""

So, energy drinks are not a better choice than soda. For a real energy boost, choose natural sources like coffee, water, and a healthy diet.

# Eat This, Not That: 10 Nutrition Myths Sabotaging Your Health

It's important to know the truth about what we eat. Many myths can harm our health. We'll look at 10 common myths that might be hurting your health.

1. *Kale is the healthiest green:* Kale is good, but not the best. Spinach, collard greens, and Swiss chard are just as good.
2. *High fructose corn syrup is worse than regular sugar:* Both can harm us if we eat too much. They have similar effects on our bodies.
3. *Sea salt is healthier than table salt:* Sea salt and table salt are not much different. Too much sodium is bad, no matter the type.
4. *Energy drinks are a healthier alternative to soda:* Energy drinks may give a quick energy boost. But they have lots of sugar and bad stuff, just like soda.

We'll look at 10 myths in this article. Knowing the truth helps us make better choices for our health.

Getting healthy means knowing the facts and questioning myths. We'll keep uncovering the truth about these myths.

# The Paleo Diet: Is It Really Better for You?

The Paleo diet is very popular now. It focuses on eating whole, unprocessed foods like our ancestors did. It includes lots of veggies, some organic protein, and good fats. But, eating too much protein can be a problem.

# Protein Intake and Weight Gain Risks

Spanish researchers found a big problem with high-protein diets like Paleo. People on these diets were 90% more likely to gain a lot of weight. This is because eating too much protein can lead to weight gain over time.

To avoid these risks, it's important to eat the right amount of protein. Adding foods like whole grains, legumes, and starchy veggies helps. This way, you can stay healthy without the dangers of too much protein.

|Nutrient|Recommended Intake|Paleo Intake|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Protein|10-35% of total calories|Typically higher, often 20-35% of total calories|
|Carbohydrates|45-65% of total calories|Typically lower, often 20-40% of total calories|
|Fats|20-35% of total calories|Typically higher, often 30-50% of total calories|

The Paleo diet is good for health because it focuses on whole foods. But, it's important to balance the food types. Eating the right amount of protein and carbs is key. This way, you can enjoy the Paleo diet's benefits without the risks.

# Calorie Myths: Are All Calories Created Equally?

Many think ""calories in, calories out"" is the secret to losing weight. But, new studies show this isn't always true. The type of food we eat affects how our body uses calories.

A 2018 study showed that low-carb and low-fat diets work equally well. This means it's not just about how many calories we eat. Foods like whole grains can even help us burn more calories, a 2017 study found.

The *impact of nutrient composition on calorie utilization* is clear. A 2019 review found the Mediterranean diet keeps weight off. But, a 2016 study warned that gluten-free foods are often unhealthy, full of bad fats and sugars.

Choosing the right foods is key for losing weight. Eating healthy foods like chicken, fish, and veggies helps keep insulin levels right. This is better than eating lots of processed foods that can make us gain weight.

|Nutrient-Dense Foods|Calorie Impact|
|:-|:-|
|Poultry, Seafood, Eggs|Help maintain healthy insulin levels and support weight loss|
|Vegetables, Healthy Fats|Provide nourishment without excessive calorie intake|
|Processed, Carbohydrate-Heavy Foods|Can lead to weight gain over time despite calorie counting|

In short, eating nutrient-rich foods is vital for losing weight. Counting calories is helpful, but focusing on food quality is more important. This leads to lasting, healthy weight loss.

# ""Natural"" Food Labels: Are They Truly Healthier?

Choosing healthy food can be tricky. The term ""natural"" on labels often confuses people. Sadly, the FDA's rules for ""natural"" are weak. This lets companies use this label on foods that aren't really healthy.

""Natural 7UP"" can say it's natural, even with high fructose corn syrup. ""Natural Cheetos"" might have maltodextrin, made in big factories.

# FDA Regulations and Marketing Tactics

The FDA doesn't check ""natural"" labels closely. This lets companies use ""natural"" to trick people. To find real, healthy foods, read labels carefully.

* The FDA doesn't define ""natural"" on food labels.
* Companies can call their products ""natural"" if they don't add color, flavors, or synthetic stuff.
* But, this means they can use processed ingredients like high fructose corn syrup.

Knowing the truth about ""natural"" labels helps. Look for whole, simple ingredients. This way, you make choices that are good for you.

# Yogurt and Gut Health: Is It Beneficial for Belly Bacteria?

Yogurt is often seen as a gut health hero. But, the truth is more complex. Some yogurts have good bacteria like Lactobacillus acidophilus. Yet, many yogurts have lots of added sugars, which can harm your gut.

To help your gut, look for yogurts with ""live active cultures"" and little sugar. Just picking any yogurt isn't enough for good digestion.

Sugar plays a big role in gut health. Too much sugar in yogurt or other foods feeds bad bacteria. This can upset your gut balance, leading to health problems.

|Probiotic Yogurt Benefits|Role of Sugar in Gut Health|Identifying Healthy Yogurt Brands|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Supports a balanced gut microbiome May enhance nutrient absorption Linked to improved immune function Potential for weight management|Feeds harmful gut bacteria and yeasts Contributes to dysbiosis (gut imbalance) Linked to digestive issues and inflammation Hinders the growth of beneficial probiotics|Look for ""live active cultures"" on the label Choose unsweetened or low-sugar varieties Opt for organic, non-GMO options when possible Consider adding your own fresh fruit for sweetness|

Be careful with sugar in yogurt and pick brands with good probiotics. A yogurt with less sugar can help your gut health. It's a great choice for a healthy diet.

>""Maintaining a healthy gut microbiome is key for well-being, and yogurt can help - if you pick the right one.""

# Cholesterol and Egg Yolks: Is There a Connection?

For years, people thought egg yolks were bad for the heart because of their cholesterol. But new studies say this might not be true. A review of over 30 studies found no link between eggs and heart problems.

Egg yolks' cholesterol doesn't seem to raise blood cholesterol levels much. A study in the Journal of the American College of Nutrition showed this. Healthy adults eating one egg a day didn't see their blood cholesterol change much.

Egg yolks do have a lot of cholesterol, but it doesn't seem to affect most people's cholesterol levels much. Studies say eating eggs in moderation is okay for most people. It doesn't increase the risk of heart disease.

# FAQ

# Is kale really the healthiest green vegetable?

Kale is not the top green for nutrients. Spinach, Romaine lettuce, and beet greens are better. Eating many greens gives you more nutrients.

# Is there a significant difference between high fructose corn syrup and regular sugar?

High fructose corn syrup and regular sugar are the same to our bodies. They both raise blood sugar and fat levels. It's best to cut down on all sugars for health.

# Are there health benefits to using sea salt over table salt?

Sea salt and table salt have the same sodium. Sea salt has trace minerals, but not enough to matter. Table salt has iodine, which sea salt lacks. For sodium watchers, there's no big difference.

# Are energy drinks a healthier alternative to soda?

No, energy drinks are not better than soda. They have lots of sugar and can harm teeth. The main energy boost comes from caffeine, not other ingredients.

# Is the Paleo diet better for weight loss and overall health?

The Paleo diet can help you lose weight at first. But eating too much protein can lead to weight gain later. It's best to eat a **balanced diet**.

# Are all calories created equal when it comes to weight management?

No, not all calories are the same. Protein takes more energy to digest than sweets. Foods like resistant starch can also affect calorie absorption. Focus on whole foods for better weight management.

# Does the ""natural"" label on food packaging mean the product is healthier?

No, ""natural"" on food labels is not regulated. It's often a marketing trick. Always check the ingredients to make sure they're real and healthy.

# Does eating yogurt automatically provide gut health benefits?

Some yogurts have good bacteria, but many have too much sugar. Look for yogurts with ""live active cultures"" and less sugar for a healthy gut.

# Do egg yolks raise cholesterol levels and increase the risk of heart disease?

No, egg yolks don't really affect blood cholesterol or heart disease risk. Eggs can be part of a healthy diet for most people.

1g7fmxs,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1g7fmxs/first_steps/,First steps,"Hi all. I'm pretty certain I have some form of IBS. I've always had issues going to the bathroom, I just wouldn't go for like a week. A few years back I went to a GI doctor and they told me to just take miralax at what rate I forget. Anyway, I have had a few pregnancies and my stomach has just worsened significantly. I have completely given up coffee because my stomach can't handle it and there are other trigger foods.

1g7fm0i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_TheQueen0fNowhere/comments/1g7fm0i/predicting_deltarune_part_25_religion/,Predicting Deltarune: Part 25 - Religion,"Now, let’s actually address why I went on this whole tirade about Everyman having connections to Gaster to begin with.
What exactly does that have to do with Alvin?
Well, besides him possibly learning about the prophecy through Gaster, of course.
Simple… I think Gerson has stronger connections to Gaster than we all thought.
I’ve seen what I’m about to say pop up at least a few times, so if you’re deep into this, you might be familiar with that.
Gerson is [an anagram of goners…](https://i.imgur.com/bpmSKM1.png) which is quite [concerning to say the least.](https://imgur.com/a/KT08hOq)
Especially considering Gerson is, well, an [actual goner in Deltarune,](https://i.imgur.com/XCfB2kV.png) although not in the way the others are.
But that’s not all.
Since Gaster was erased from the Undertale world, not being mentioned by anyone and 
Sans keeping notes related to [not forgetting people,](https://i.imgur.com/KQe3yuC.png) it led to the common assumption by the fanbase that Gaster has even been erased from everyone’s minds, which is supported [by Goner Kid’s dialogue.](https://imgur.com/a/R73w4aQ)
That would explain how the history and relationships Gaster must have had are absent in the world, at least for the most part, once we explore it in Undertale.
However, there are a few things we can extrapolate.
One is that Gaster and Asgore were probably friends, considering he was the [original royal scientist and Alphys certainly has at least an amicable relationship with Asgore.](https://imgur.com/a/XRU71AN)
Asgore was of course [long acquainted with and seemingly trusted Gerson,](https://imgur.com/a/1AgcRLC) so it’s not impossible to assume that Gaster and Gerson knew each other through Asgore.
Despite Gaster having his lab in Hotland and the skelebros currently living in Snowdin, [the Mysteryman, Goner Kid and even technically Redacted all appear in Waterfall,](https://imgur.com/a/uOIV6KW) without any given reason as to why.
Of course, [Clam Girl does too,](https://i.imgur.com/PIDPzwB.png) but she’s also… a clam, so she has a reason to be here.
Anyway, my long talks about Undertale and Deltarune’s themes of water offer an explanation, as well as Waterfall being the “lore area” of the game, but this is ALSO the area Gerson lives in too.
I know, still not enough to satisfy you, but there’s one other interesting thing to note as well.

In the official tarot card deck of Undertale… [Gerson is the IX Hermit card.](https://i.imgur.com/OUA32uJ.png)
However, Dogbomber, the artist behind it, [originally drew Gaster for the Hermit card.](https://i.imgur.com/MjofVWz.png)
I assume that when, [what started as just fanart,](https://dogbomber.tumblr.com/post/132310526044/here-it-is-the-full-set-of-undertale-tarot-cards) became [official merchandise,](https://www.fangamer.com/collections/undertale/products/undertale-tarot-cards) the divine intervention of [most likely Toby Fox himself](https://i.imgur.com/8IlNzW0.png) led to the card being changed.
Mystery Man was never confirmed to actually look like this after all (and if it was his genuine appearance, Toby wouldn’t confirm it this way), and neither is Gaster ever going to be acknowledged this blatantly in an Undertale product if he’s supposed to be a secret character in that game of course… so this move makes perfect sense.
So the fact that out of all people, Gerson was the one to replace Gaster… it’s certainly another neat connection between the two.
Especially with [the artist having fun and directly acknowledging it at the bottom of this post.](https://dogbomber.tumblr.com/post/152096840539/undertale-cards-part-2-now-that-people-have)
And then there’s one more thing worth extrapolating for this… well, Gerson is a smart guy.
[He’s a historian](https://imgur.com/a/6T4My9x) and in Deltarune even [shown to have been a blacksmith,](https://imgur.com/a/BbTmoqH) so he’s got the handiwork down too.
I can definitely see a potential partnership with Gaster, where Gaster is the brain coming up with plans and blueprints, while Gerson is the brawn actually making them.
Seem far-fetched?
Understandable, so how about this… don’t you think it’s bizarre [how Gerson knows that you’re unable to attack him in his shop?](https://imgur.com/a/mGovQ8h)
It’s… incredibly meta, but we have no idea how he’s aware of this.
[Snowdin shopkeeper certainly isn’t and ran away.](https://imgur.com/a/2hgPTPy)
The only other person we’ve seen break the fourth wall this blatantly [is Sans, even if he mostly does it to mess with you,](https://imgur.com/a/kgYDSYl) and HIS connections to Gaster [are very blatant, which you should know by now.](https://imgur.com/a/plhxzXs)
But of course, Gerson has no apparent reason.
Meanwhile, the second person in line when it comes to fourth wall breaks… [is Jevil, in case you forgot,](https://imgur.com/a/Nwe3IL8) where the game also makes it evident that [he has received his knowledge from none other than Gaster.](https://imgur.com/a/vkmU1IL)
Considering this trend, Gerson may have learned a thing or two from his partner as well, as Gaster seems to be the common thread when it comes to meta awareness.
But the final nail in the coffin for me… goes back to the idea of Gerson being the brawn.
The technician, you could say.
One who might, I dunno, created the Gaster Blasters like he has created other weapons previously from his blacksmithing career.
Why would I think that?
Heh…

There are multiple noticeable skulls we see throughout Undertale.
[The Hyper Goner](https://i.imgur.com/2pe2J6Y.png) that Asriel summons doesn’t resemble any known skull, but obviously looks like the boss monsters in the game, aka representing the Dreemurr family and being fully connected to them.
The “Goner” [in its name](https://i.imgur.com/01GhbSt.png) also gives it an association with Gaster as well, something I had also taken into account for my rebirth theory due to [its supposed effects](https://i.imgur.com/QTB7nfI.png) if it had succeeded.
Moving on, [the DT Extractor,](https://i.imgur.com/uThfvQv.png) or at least something aesthetically resembling it with the layout and wires, [is something that appears during the fight against Omega Flowey, but it also resembles the Gyftrot character quite a bit,](https://imgur.com/a/wfuHmej) who has a really odd and out of place skull already, potentially tying this one to Christmas and deers.
This could give this skull a connection to the Holiday family and hint at them being major characters in Deltarune, but of course also tying back to Gaster again due to the extractor.
And if Sans and Papyrus are actually part of Gaster’s family, that would mean the Gaster family themselves being skeletons makes them… already represent themselves, they’re their own skulls.
That only leaves the Gaster Blasters as the last prominent skull featured in the game, so what are they?
If you thought the other stuff was weak and dumb, then this is where I’ll blow your mind.
We aren’t just dealing with a connection here, because there’s straight up one real life skull I found that resembles this freakish thing more than I’d like, if you can believe it.
And that is… [the skull of the snapping turtle.](https://imgur.com/a/cv98ZwT)
It’s not a match, but it’s [close enough to just look like a twisted version of it](https://i.imgur.com/WC7IFVl.png) that doesn’t seem like a coincidence, considering how incredibly unique the most prominent features are.
[Lots of turtle skulls seem to have that general shape,](https://i.imgur.com/KJivBvG.png) so it doesn’t necessarily have to be a snapping turtle specifically, but those were the only skulls I found to have such a wide grin-like opening for a mouth.
To me, this has to mean that Toby modeled the blasters after turtle skulls in general.
Abd for us this would mean… the Boom family is now also represented.

It’s starting to feel like all the noteworthy skulls we see in Undertale have a connection to and hint towards the major families we will see in Deltarune.
The Dreemurrs, the Holidays, the Booms, and finally the Gasters.
All of which are of course the only families in the game whose last names we even know to begin with, being enough to signify their importance by itself already.
So if we ever find out Burgerpants’ real full name, you know for sure that he’s a big deal.
Jokes aside, this without a doubt ties Gerson and his entire family to Gaster, and if my proposal of them working together is true… then the conclusion must be that the Gaster Blasters are designed after his likeness.
And this, which is not entirely related to our topic, ties to a strong assumption I’m making.
Which is that all of these families will function somewhat like factions, and each of their youngest child is going to contribute to the end of the world:
Kris for the Dreemurrs, Noelle for the Holidays, Alvin for the Booms, and last but not least… Papyrus for the Gasters.
And I believe all of them are going to have roles assigned to them.
Kris is the Lightbringer (let’s just call them that because [it’s a sick title and devil reference](https://imgur.com/a/30qXdM9)) and leader of the Heroes, Noelle is [the Angel,](https://imgur.com/a/b94AFOf) Alvin is the Everyman, and Papyrus I believe to be none other than the Roaring Knight himself.
And the reason they all end up here is the fault of none other than their own parents.
I could talk about this more and provide all the evidence I have for coming to this conclusion, but this is something I wanted to keep for a theory where I specifically want to hone in on Papyrus and all my thoughts on that skeleton, so let’s focus and get back on track.
Maybe it’s clear to you now how I changed my mind on Alvin from my previous views.
I used to hold the opinion that Alvin is the best candidate for being the Knight, as he not only has connections to the classroom dark world, but due to his wife/mother, he also has some to the library, where the next one was opened.
But I went back on that.
I mean, he still has a high likelihood of being the Knight, but I personally think he’s more of an orchestrator behind the scenes.
Someone who guides and preaches, like his job demands.
I think Papyrus is a more fitting choice for the Knight, Alvin is the Everyman instead, an equally important role in the grand scheme of things.
Which is why I think i should probably finally get back on this topic, after I’ve managed to establish the connection both Everyman and Gerson have to Gaster, which was the most important takeaway from this, regardless of what you think of the rest.

Now, there’s more to say about Everyman than his initial appearance, as you should already know.
The first is that Everyman appears everywhere in Deltarune, [as I had already shown,](https://imgur.com/a/nDG9YgU) which is quite odd.
And maybe you think I’m exaggerating the “everywhere” part.
What I actually mean with that are the types of locations, because Everyman imagery appears in BOTH the light and dark world, consequently meaning that Everyman also must have a presence in both.
Obviously fits Alvin, who I propose to have visited the dark world, making him a traveler between worlds as well, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself.
Second thing is that Everyman appears in a weird spot inside the Undertale Art Book.
All the stuff related to one location is usually grouped together, [but he appears sandwiched between the Core mercenaries,](https://i.imgur.com/hmpDCed.png) with the exception [of Final Froggit,](https://i.imgur.com/JMq8CbZ.png) who easily could have fit into this lineup, but Everyman was curiously chosen over them on that page.
I mean, seriously… Froggit is next to Reaper Bird, Everyman SHOULD be there instead.
The mercenaries overall are [sandwiched between amalgamate stuff, including Reaper Bird.](https://imgur.com/a/cA0DD0f)
And I keep pointing this placement out because Everyman’s original appearance [was inside the Reaper Bird amalgamate,](https://i.imgur.com/R6gAA9x.png) whose design actually [consists of three Core mercenaries,](https://i.imgur.com/omMJW38.png) giving us a possible reason why those enemies are all grouped together in the book.
This seems to imply to me that Toby created the mercenaries AND Everyman together, and therefore at the same time as Reaper Bird, which makes sense as it was also [the first amalgamate in general.](https://i.imgur.com/nMzmK89.png)
So why the strange choice to connect Everyman with not just Reaper Bird, but all the mercs?
Maybe because all the mercenaries follow a classic fantasy theme, [including an actual KNIGHT, whose original design bears at least a slight resemblance to one of the titans AND also has a sleeping theme on top of it all.](https://imgur.com/a/lkEgakP)
But even for the other two, Toby originally envisioned [Whimsalot to have a skull head, and Madjick to have floating Rayman hands,](https://imgur.com/a/o6wKqIp) **both** skull and [hand imagery, obviously invoking Gaster,](https://imgur.com/a/ofKAqLe) maybe being so obvious that it was the reason Toby scrapped those ideas.
All of this seems like it was intended to further tie the Everyman to both Gaster and the Knight.
Just don’t ask me how Final Froggit and Astigmatism relate, but Froggit does deliberately appear separate in the art book, so I think we get a pass for at least ignoring them right now.

Now that I’m [looking at the lineup we have here again,](https://i.imgur.com/hmpDCed.png) I can’t help but wonder if this also ties into my proposal of the 4 main figures that bring the apocalypse in Deltarune.
Everyman would obviously be himself/Alvin, the Knight Knight represents the Knight/Papyrus, and then the two more difficult ones remain… or are they?
[A shy and defenseless creature not just turning confident, but originally even turning into a death reaper,](https://imgur.com/a/0HMxAx8) sounds strangely a lot like what I propose for Noelle and her role as Angel, making Whimsalot a stand-in for her.
Meanwhile Madjick has what Kris wishes they had, [magical abilities, while also looking like a stereotypical magician, not unlike Ralsei who I propose to just be Kris’ fursona basically, and also having obscured eyes and using Christian projectiles](https://imgur.com/a/Pm01sf6) to tie into the greater themes, making Madjick a stand-in for the Lightbringer/Kris.
So once I really stretch it, all 4 of them can be represented through this line-up… am I onto something or just crazy, your call.
Also, Final Froggit and Astigmatism aren’t actually entirely useless either, despite not being part of this 4 character line-up.
Because they ARE the characters who make up Reaper Bird, along with Whimsalot, and the appearance of [all three together as an enemy group is also appropriately called “nightmare”,](https://i.imgur.com/gRtTppo.png) likely a reference to Reaper Bird.
But with the themes of dreams in Deltarune, I can’t help but wonder if even that “nightmare” line ends up tying back to it.
And now I can finally get to the most interesting part that ties the Everyman back to Alvin and how I can hopefully convince you of that being his identity.
The amalgamates are obviously [all monsters who have “fallen down”,](https://imgur.com/a/hqqsd1e) who basically are on death’s bed without chance of recovery.
But in the pacifist ending, they’re reunited with their families… well, except for two noteworthy exceptions.
[Both the Memoryheads and the Reaper Bird are nowhere to be seen in the underground.](https://imgur.com/a/ym55nz7)
For the Memoryheads, I had already made an observation in the past on how I think [they might be an amalgamate of Deltarune’s Shadow Crystal bosses](https://old.reddit.com/r/Deltarune/comments/q88aib/the_secret_behind_undertales_memoryhead/) in Deltarune and [don’t really “exist” physically like the other Amalgamates, and instead seem more like a bad phone signal.](https://imgur.com/a/x1J9fTl)
Reaper Bird on the other hand… doesn’t have that, so it’s an odd choice to leave them out.
I think that should already make you suspicious.
But that brings us to another observation.

Despite the amalgamates being made up of multiple monsters, both Lemon Bread and the Snowy one exclusively focus on and represent one individual, [Shyren’s sister and Snowdrake’s mother respectively.](https://imgur.com/a/o6H4CcI)
And this trend of amalgamates essentially having one flagship monster is further demonstrated in the next game.
As you likely already know, the graveyard in Deltarune shows us that those amalgamate monsters have also already long passed in this world since Alphys [never brought them back,](https://i.imgur.com/8tWb6mP.png) each grave definitely showing [just a single core monster representing one of the  amalgamates.](https://imgur.com/a/SybHn1n)
Of course, we can then assume that for Reaper Bird, the main rep would be Everyman.
So… [where is it, why is Gerson here instead?](https://imgur.com/a/77JIJfD)
The only other one missing in the graveyard is Memoryhead, which I already explained has curious properties to begin with, so that adds up.
And now this is the second time Reaper Bird is the odd one out as well, maybe even third, since Everyman is kinda the flagship monster and he’s not even part of the regular sprite.
Reaper Bird does not have a grave, and neither does Everyman, this is an obvious and very intentional distinction from the other amalgamates that are present.
And that’s exactly the thing, I think it’s because who Everyman is… they aren’t dead in this world, they’re still alive.
But you know who IS dead?
[Gerson, Gerson’s grave is where Reaper Bird should be, no, where Everyman should be.](https://i.imgur.com/v7xXACV.png)
This clearly ties Gerson to Everyman, but it also shows that they aren’t the same.
[When Gerson is alive, Everyman seems to be dead, as a part of the Reaper Bird amalgamate,](https://imgur.com/a/qRQJWR2) but on the other hand, [when Gerson is dead, Everyman appears to be alive and shows up multiple times.](https://imgur.com/a/CMkG5qT)

I think in the world of Undertale, Alvin has died.
It could explain why Gerson lives [just outside the area of the other Waterfall residents,](https://imgur.com/a/DgXtAsJ) one could say [he’s a “hermit”,](https://i.imgur.com/OUA32uJ.png) or why this [mysterious Alvin in Deltarune](https://i.imgur.com/zm4hZN9.png) somehow doesn’t appear in Undertale and is never mentioned by Gerson in that world, despite literally being his son.
That’s why [Everyman, Alvin, is an amalgamate there…](https://i.imgur.com/5EXqeYF.png) I mean, you can’t be revived unless you died before.
And in Deltarune, where many things are the opposite of how they normally are, [Gerson is the one who died,](https://i.imgur.com/DOfqB7f.png) while Everyman, his son Alvin, is still alive and not buried with the rest of the deceased.
That’s why there’s no equivalent of the Reaper Bird/Everyman in the graveyard, why it’s such an outlier.
And that all brings me to the smoking gun.
Everyman’s appearance.
[Bizarre, simplistic, a scrunkly,](https://i.imgur.com/2WDA3VA.png) you wouldn’t even want to think it represents an actual character.
But that’s the thing, I think it’s simplistic for a reason, because it’s based on something that’s equally simplistic.
Remember [Alvin’s drawing of his father?](https://i.imgur.com/WvHDQdQ.png)
It resembles Everyman [to a degree that I’m not comfortable with.](https://imgur.com/a/X7F8KHN)
A bad children’s drawing of a turtle resembling Everyman… is that really a coincidence?
And if we’re being honest, even [the Everyman that we know does somewhat resemble the Alvin and Gerson, minus the shell.](https://i.imgur.com/tttZ86x.png)
Is it perfect?
No, but try and find me any other character that suits it better.
Alvin is clearly one of the center people of Hometown, being the one in charge of the church.
I wouldn’t at all find it surprising if people decided to pay tribute and also lovingly clown on him [by crudely painting his old drawing around town.](https://i.imgur.com/FrXlUWU.png)
I know that since the drawing depicts Gerson himself, it would make more sense intuitively for Everyman to be Gerson, but like I said, Gerson is the one alive in Undertale and Everyman is dead, while in Deltarune it clearly looks like they have swapped places, so it can’t be him.
Everyman represents Alvin, because it’s his drawing, but it’s a depiction of a Gerson.
You following this?

And now the last thing, heavily speculatory, as if the rest wasn’t already.
This is something you don’t have to take **as** seriously as the rest, but it was certainly fun to speculate about.
In Undertale, [Everyman’s head was consumed by a bunch of butterflies,](https://imgur.com/a/aHo5hNX) a very strange detail that definitely shouldn’t be written off to just be for the creep factor, if we assume him to be a character of importance.
In fact, this part I AM confident about, butterflies are seen as [a symbol of the soul and bad omens in Japanese culture,](https://i.imgur.com/AQrLRUw.png) both of which play a big role here.
Romans even have [this sculpture,](https://i.imgur.com/oKZdiqq.png) so if [that event with Everyman doesn’t already represent a bad omen…](https://imgur.com/a/aHo5hNX) well, him spewing out more than one butterfly certainly strengthens the connection to dead people.
None of this is helped by [butterflies also being seen as a symbol of transformation, hope and rebirth, naturally due to them changing from a caterpillar, and a bunch of other things that all seem incredibly relevant to Deltarune.](https://imgur.com/a/gl0FWHG)
Especially all of [these points](https://i.imgur.com/i1yZWZV.png) could either happen in the game or be very important themes of Deltarune, and a bunch of them tie into my proposed conclusion of the story when it comes to the fate of the world.
Both Everyman and butterflies… very important to Deltarune, despite their original appearance being in Undertale.
For the future, we REALLY have to look out for butterflies as potential symbolism, but with this intrinsic connection to Everyman in mind, what if I told you we likely already saw a butterfly appear in Deltarune, in a scene where it’s often overlooked?
Well, it could either be a butterfly OR a moth, but I think you should know in this context.
The scene in question is when the King in chapter 1 is defeated, [as his cape turns out to be a living creature that flies off](https://imgur.com/a/zPNq05U) and is then [never seen again on him.](https://i.imgur.com/dGDO67N.png)
Incredibly odd detail, most people don’t react strongly to it either, so what was its purpose here specifically?
Well, this is where my tinfoil hat is on, because I propose that this was [the Shadow Mantle that Seam wanted to give you in chapter 2 to have a chance against the chapter 3 Shadow Crystal boss.](https://imgur.com/a/TqBHHG9)
And the reason they don’t have it anymore is because the King stole it, before losing it there at the end as well, as you just saw.
Why would he steal it in the first place, you ask?
The mantle, or cape, tying back to butterflies isn’t the only Everyman connection.
As I brought up earlier, I think that [Gerson and Alvin previously had adventures in that dark world, which Gerson mistook for a dream,](https://imgur.com/a/yq85wPu) and that [the King befriended them and was basically their Lancer.](https://imgur.com/a/oXqwvGC)
It’s their disappearance that [made him the way he is right now,](https://i.imgur.com/Anfms0y.png) feeling betrayed.
So the reason he stole the mantle?
Well, it could be [yet another thing suggesting that he’s still holding onto those times,](https://imgur.com/a/BR8NJac) because it can represent either or even both of those lightners in his mind.

Personally, I think… the mantle is the drawing Alvin made of Gerson, the origins of the Everyman sketch.
And in the dark world, it transformed into this butterfly cape.
That is why the Shadow Mantle got lost between the transition of moving things from the Card Kingdom to Castle Town.
It’s impossible for either the King or Seam to have carried it with them there, because [the drawing was one of the items that Kris didn’t take with them and left behind inside the unused classroom.](https://imgur.com/a/xctqf6m)
The positioning of the real world objects also implies that the cabinet was the equivalent to the Card Castle, which makes the position of the drawing work out perfectly for us too.
It’s also one of the reasons why I think chapter 3 is gonna allow you to leave and enter the new dark world as you please, not just because [Kris will be regarded highly for creating the fountain](https://imgur.com/a/4xMxGBc) (and Tenna likely knowing them personally due to being in their home), but also because this is a perfect set-up to have [Kris break into the closed school in the early morning](https://imgur.com/a/OEUnuBj) to retrieve the mantle as part of doing the secret boss sidequest, not to mention it allows for us to go into Castle Town in chapter 3, which would otherwise be inaccessible while everything is closed down.
So yeah, this is my unhinged hypothesis of how the butterfly imagery connected to Everyman will be relevant and how it connects back to Alvin… I’m okay and definitely not purely running on coffee, what do you mean?
I also wanted to bring one more thing up, which is that I think this could also be loosely connected to another theory I have.

I believe all of the Shadow Crystals that secret bosses hold… are created when a lightner abandons their hopes and dreams.
This becomes clear to me [because of Spamton, as he didn’t carry one of those by default, but found and took it inside the old machine,](https://imgur.com/a/s3c8EWT) which is clearly supposed to be [a sketch Mettaton had made of his ideal body that he lacks in this world, before ultimately discarding it](https://imgur.com/a/MR4WzM5)… an abandoned dream.
And that made me realize something important… where did Jevil get his crystal from, then?
If that’s how it works, that Spamton didn’t naturally receive it and had to find it somewhere, clearly it must have been [the same with Jevil,](https://i.imgur.com/m1lmGfx.png) right?
So perhaps it was either Gerson or Alvin’s abandoned dream, and those are the only people we know who have a strong connection to the classroom that dark world takes place in, as I already showed earlier.
But I assume this abandoned dream was specifically Gerson’s.
Not just because Alvin already has his thing going on with the drawing and Everyman, but also because this abandoned dream narrative seems like one more way for Toby to give characters more… well, characterization.
And not only did Gerson quite literally abandon a dream [by dismissing the dark world and thinking it didn’t happen,](https://imgur.com/a/JiMtb4v) but also in the traditional sense of [leaving everything he’s done behind to focus on his new career as fantasy author.](https://imgur.com/a/oTkZdbU)
Something talked about positively by Alvin, but I’m sure couldn’t have been something Gerson could just do on a whim and without any regrets.
This seems like the ideal way to explore all of that.
Last but not least, it does feel like [Alvin’s action could be something he mistakes for continuing his father’s legacy,](https://imgur.com/a/QqQjAgI) so I feel the game might be playing with the idea of Alvin digging up this supposed abandoned dream and continuing it for his sake… in more ways than one, *cough*.
Maybe Gerson being what the Everyman actually depicts, but Alvin representing him instead, could also be because that’s [what Gerson actually was, an everyman,](https://imgur.com/a/2TtOkVi) and Alvin is now taking up the mantle, but clearly failing if my theories are right.
To me it’s also clear that with the King’s still unexplored and just implied backstory of how he came to be this way, Jevil’s lack of characterization and screen time compared to Spamton, as well with all the hints that Gerson and Alvin play a bigger role in the narrative, I think it’s obvious that sooner or later we’ll HAVE to get a backstory focused on what happened in the Card Kingdom a long time ago, because it has just too much history that we don’t know and warrants an actual explanation… one that could be done for all these characters in one go.
Honestly, no one better to tell that story and slowly reveal the importance of Gerson and Alvin to us than the King himself, their old Lancer, because it wouldn’t be a Toby Fox game unless he slowly warms up to you in that hamster prison of his, even if [he tries his best not to.](https://i.imgur.com/SljajMA.png)
Who knows, maybe he would be the reason you even know where to get the Shadow Mantle to begin with by accidentally letting a few things slip if you pay him a visit next time.

Alright, enough of this.
I’m sure you must be concerned for my mental health with all the hypothetical scenarios I’ve already planned out in detail inside my head.
However, there’s a big aspect here that you might have questioned… which is why I’m talking about all of this now during the religion section.
Well, I originally said Alvin being a priest is obviously one of those reasons, but the rest really was just a barely adjacent tangent in that case.
You would be wrong!
I mean, it was a tangent, albeit a necessary one to establish Alvin and Everyman being the same individual.
And with Everyman being referred to as a [good guy who shows up on occasion, the way Alvin has been portrayed](https://imgur.com/a/zj3EMSv) up to this point and is also most likely perceived as by other characters, that certainly adds up in that aspect too.
But it goes deeper, which is the origins of the term “Everyman”.
You might have never even dared to think anything of that, after all, “everyman” isn’t really that uncommon of a word to use, as it’s a term that describes a fictional character that [the audience can easily identify themselves with.](https://i.imgur.com/fcWYBFm.png)
Maybe you can already see that doesn’t really have much to do with either Alvin or the way Toby speaks of Everyman.
So what if I told you that the term actually has some very peculiar origins, which is that of the Everyman play, [“The Summoning of Everyman”.](https://i.imgur.com/3QPQf1A.png)
And, as you may have guessed from this larger topic, it’s a Christian play specifically.
Once you look at it, you can see that [it’s about Christian salvation, and how when faced with death, a man representing us all realizes that only his good deeds will matter in the end.](https://imgur.com/a/lbL4IWy)
One could also say… [he’s a good guy.](https://i.imgur.com/m6zJdY7.png)

I think that alone should show that Toby choosing to name his wacky character “Everyman” and characterizing him that way, to be aspirational even, makes it very obvious that he did not base the name on the term used for stock characters, but specifically this play instead.
Which undoubtedly ties Toby’s Everyman to Christianity, giving me even more reason to think that it represents Father Alvin, the most obvious religious character.
Although I think a part of Everyman’s pilgrimage in the story would also be fitting for [a lot of characters regarding the dark world,](https://imgur.com/a/ZOC05Jt) which I think even includes the Knight, so Toby likely chose this play for more than one reason. 
Which is useful, because I find it hard to apply much of it to Alvin, considering we know barely anything about him and what he could all parallel.
We just know too little about what he thinks, everything just being speculation, and I’d rather base that off of in-game clues, like me thinking that he was in the dark world and likely wants to go back.
Maybe this is another indication that I’m always on the right track with my research, but reaching wrong conclusions because of my own biases, like trying to apply all of this to Alvin.
Mayhaps.
Still, the play is definitely something worth looking at for him regardless, instead of just Deltarune’s overall themes.
The Everyman in the story [being confronted with imminent death](https://i.imgur.com/Tub5IHP.png) could certainly hold meaning for us.
Not only does Alvin seem closely tied to death through his deceased father, but also because the graveyard, like many are, [is right next to the church.](https://imgur.com/a/Y71512V)
That man is likely constantly reminded of death, especially of his father, and he [doesn’t just have to thank his location for that.](https://imgur.com/a/5yJKJOv)
More importantly as well… I said it earlier already, Everyman’s status as amalgamate means he’s clearly dead in Undertale.
That’s also a connection to death, especially if Alvin really is our Everyman, because then **he is** straight up dead in the other game.
Which of course also brings us to some HEAVY speculation that we might be able to gather through this play.

If Everyman is Alvin and Alvin died in Undertale… then how did he die?
And that’s where my thought comes in, what if Alvin is soon going to die in the world of Deltarune too, whether it’s through sickness or anything else?
[Rudy died earlier in the timeline of Undertale as well,](https://imgur.com/a/FDrcHNi) so I don’t think it’s much out of the question that if Alvin died in that world, something else could get him here, sooner or later.
Since Deltarune does take place later, maybe he and Gerson didn’t switch places, just that Alvin has been holding out longer in Deltarune, thanks to… I don’t know, the wonders of modern medicine maybe?
Especially if it IS a disease like Rudy, which is also a really good set-up, since Mr Holiday’s condition could lead to Alvin now facing his own mortality, which can have implications.
Think about it, if Alvin is **now** springing into action, and, as I proposed, is going to also lead Noelle down the path of becoming the Angel to fulfill his own version of the prophecy, then maybe this is all happening because he knows he doesn’t have much time left.
If he wants to go back to the dark world he saw as a child, he has to find a way to do it now.
And to take it farther, bring the Angel’s Heaven now.
It’s now or never for him and his holy mission.
Interestingly enough, I also theorized on how OMORI parallels could exist to Deltarune where [Kris is working under a limited time to bring their brother back to life before his supposed return,](https://imgur.com/a/rrRIvZP) so if another major character also has a time limit on himself, there could be some interesting parallels the game draws between the two characters.
Kris and Alvin… doesn’t really sound like two characters you would expect to have anything in common, especially in the character motivation department.
But let’s not forget that [Alvin does clearly look up to his father in a potentially similar way that Kris most likely does to their admirable brother,](https://imgur.com/a/liqCBrv) who is also deceased in my mind.
And remember the whole thing earlier I mentioned about how dead people are probably going to be revived in the Roaring and all that?
Yeah, I brought up how Alvin could be bringing his daddy back to life here too, just like how Kris may intend to do with good old Asriel.
There might be more those two have in common than we thought.
But then again, the Kris thing was also based on heavy speculation, so maybe I shouldn’t cross that with something that is equally carried by me writing fanfiction.
Although I’d argue Alvin trying to bring Gerson back to life is way more sound and supported by lore than Kris trying to bring dead Asriel back, honestly.
Not to mention that Everyman, while representing Alvin, is a depiction of Gerson in Alvin’s drawing.
So if Gerson was revived through the hammer and his dark world self ends up resembling Everyman a lot, it would all end up tying things back together.
Whatever, screw you all, I’m sane.

To get back to the Everyman play, I’m not exactly sure how the rest of it could fit into Alvin’s storyline, but if it’s just somewhat based on it, [we have the concept of him knowing he’s gonna die soon and starting a journey because of it, in order to metaphorically find things that were worth living for and to accompany him to death…](https://i.imgur.com/6qXPtce.png) and well, that sounds plausible enough for a potential parallel.
Although I’m not sure how many good deeds Alvin will have by the end of this, because I got the feeling he’ll do some messed up shit to finally reach the Angel’s Heaven, and to probably also realize that it was not what he expected it to be.
Speaking of Angel’s Heaven, I know it’s not surprising with the religion talk anymore, but [he ascends into heaven, meets an angel, and the lesson of the entire play is given… by a doctor too?](https://i.imgur.com/jxUdNif.png)
I’M JUST SAYING!
There’s one thing I wanted to bring up in relation to this that might not just apply to Alvin in particular, but perhaps all the characters, but most importantly you as the player.
Toby once mentioned that [there’s something more important than reaching the end,](https://i.imgur.com/kfQNt3S.png) which to me always brought a particular vision into mind, what the one ending would allow for.
It’s the idea that if you know the world is inevitably gonna end and there’s nothing you can do about it, like this unchanging apocalyptic ending I envision, then how are you going to live those last days out, if you know you’ll never have to face the consequences of your actions?
Add that time loop thing into the mix, and we got a classic kind of story told in a completely unique and insanely interactive way.
The notion of what to do in your last days without consequences would certainly be a neat contrast to Undertale, in which you’re always made to face your consequences, something we’re already well acquainted with.
Seeing what people will do without having to face those might be more interesting to Toby at this point, and could be yet another possible explanation for 
[why the original demo was framed as a survey.](https://imgur.com/a/BY5mc5U)
This whole ordeal actually has something to do with the Everyman play as well, and if we assume that I’m completely wrong about Alvin being Everyman (impossible), then I think the following is the true reason Toby chose to reference this play.
After all, [it’s about certain death,](https://imgur.com/a/Lr6we7A) and how only your good deeds accompany you after that, not just affecting yourself and others, but also how God will judge you, as I had shown before.
And if we view Toby as God, then he will judge the hell out of you for being an asshole in the game, but I think that will be the end of it, since I believe it to be the end of the world.
That would be the difference to the Everyman story.
[Looking at how the play starts,](https://i.imgur.com/DEkKJ8f.png) it’s obvious how strongly it applies to Undertale, but Everyman’s presence in Deltarune surely suggests that it connects to that game and its themes as well, but in a different way.
And that’s how I came to the conclusion that THIS is what matters more than reaching the ending.
Both stories are the same deal, probably with a similar setup, except that Deltarune lacks “God’s” punishment.
Your good deeds give no extrinsic rewards, your bad deeds won’t come back to bite you.
The final test to determine what kind of person you are, a true test.
While Alvin might be **the** Everyman, it turns out [we were actually all Everyman as well by playing Deltarune…](https://i.imgur.com/DYsGaFQ.png) I’m 13 and this is deep.

The pair was in an unmarked car, which meant they were experienced - it takes time to get to the level of wearing plain clothes when you’re on duty. There was only one reason a couple of high-ranking law enforcement agents would be here in Edwards and I knew why. Everyone in town did.


Three murdered . . . in three months.


I’ve had a good sense of hearing for a long time, and as the two cops walked toward the diner I could hear them discussing between themselves on how to handle the interview.


Interview?


Shit.


I tossed my cigarette butt on the ground and offered them a pleasant smile.


“Hey, y’all,” I said with my drawled Southern accent. “Come on in, get some breakfast. Can I get you fellas some coffee?”


The two men were tall and well-manicured: clean shaven faces, no nonsense haircuts. They wore the same cologne, which I thought was funny, but their suits were different.


“Sounds great, ma’am,” Navy Suit said. “I take my coffee black.”


“Cream and sugar for me,” Gray Suit said.


They took a booth by the front window and I went around the counter to find Lola bringing out three plates of breakfast food. The plate balancing on her forearm tilted and I reached to grab it before it dumped eggs all over the customers sitting at the counter.


“Thanks, Grace,” Lola said. “Great reflexes.”


“When you’ve worked at diners as long as I have, you learn how to spot accidents before they happen.”


Grace nodded toward our newest customers with a puzzled look.


“Cops, I think.” I said. “I’m getting their coffee now.”


I brought them their drinks and took a notepad out of my apron. The faster they ate they faster they could leave. Everyone in the diner knew why they were here and it was making the customers nervous.


“What’ll it be, boys? You seem like waffle men to me.”


They didn’t watch my smile, but instead looked at my chest.


“We’re not here for breakfast, ma’am,” Navy Suit said. “We’re here to see you.”


“Me?”


Gray Suit pointed to the name tag on my chest. “Your name is Grace? Grace Burton?”


I nodded.


Navy Suit stood and offered his hand. “I’m Detective Hartwig, this is Detective Cable. We’re from upstate and have been called in to assist in the ongoing investigation-”


“Let me stop you right there, detective.” My voice was more acidic than necessary. “I know why you’re here. Everyone does. In a town with 1,034 people-”


“1,031 people now, ma’am.”


I stared at my feet. Hartwig moved into the booth with his partner and pointed across the table. “Please sit. We only want to ask a few questions.”


“If I refuse?”


Hartwig gestured to his coffee. “We could finish these . . . at the police station.”


I rolled my eyes then sat across from them. 


Cable removed a folder from his inner jacket pocket and scanned the papers inside. “It says here you are 62 years old.”


“That’s correct.”


He smiles. “I hope you don’t mind me saying, but you don’t look a day over forty.”


“I get that a lot. I’m a vegetarian. What do you gentlemen want?”


Hartwig straightened his tie. “When you were 25 years old you were involved in an incident at this diner.”


My skin grew cold. “You want to know about what happened in 1987?”


“Yes. Particularly the events that lead to the death of your boyfriend at the time -” he looked at his notes - “Peter Callen.”


“Why do you want me to bring up painful memories, detectives?”


“Three people have been murdered in Edwards over the last few months,” Cable seethed. “We’ve been gathering information from the past about this small Mississippi town and your file came up. There have only been two major incidents of homicides in Edwards: now and in 1987. And you’re the only connection between the two.”


Hartwig quickly added, “We aren’t saying you’re a suspect, mind you, but we refuse to leave any stone left unturned. We’ve seen the briefs about your testimony from that night, but we want to hear it from your own mouth, Ms. Burton.” 


“Okay.” I grabbed Cable’s coffee for myself and took a sip. The men traded glances. “My shift at the diner started late that night. I remember walking through the parking lot and being amazed. The moon was so full and bright it left shadows under the cars.”


***


I pulled my 1980 Chevy Citation into the lot and reapplied my lipstick while Bob Seger blasted over the radio. The song was from his newest album, Like a Rock. Great album by the way. Anyway, I got out of my car and walked toward the building. Like I said, the moon was so bright that night.


I’d been working at Silver Spoon Diner for two years, so I knew what to expect. The usuals ate earlier, before my shift started, so the only ones stopping in a diner that late were those society might deem uncouth: truckers coming back to empty houses; randoms just passing through on their way to Jackson; insomniacs wasting another sleepless night; people running from trouble or people running toward trouble.


I came into work every day with a smile on my face and that night was no different. Wendy, another waitress, greeted me with a hug, a Marlboro Red 100 propped between her lips. Back then everyone smoked. The diner itself could get foggy during busy hours from the secondhand smoke. Anyway, Wendy walked with me to the back while I put my personables in my locker.


Since I had worked at the diner the longest, I had a copy of the key that locked the front and back doors. I slipped it in my pocket then put on my waitress apron while Wendy went on about a new movie she’d just watched in theaters.


Wendy removed her cigarette. “Oh, you should have seen him, Grace. He was lifting her so high and spinning her around like she was weightless.”


“So I should go see it?”


“It’s worth the $3.50 movie ticket price to see Patrick Swayze. When he took his shirt off I was drooling . . . like, literally, drooling.”


“Big whoop. You know how Peter gets when I look at other men. He’s the most jealous boyfriend ever.”


Wendy kissed the air and rolled her eyes. “More Swayze for me then.”


She went to help customers while I made a circuit around the kitchen. Our cook, Penny, dropped some thin bacon on the stovetop with a sizzle. He was athletic and tall, but an injury took away his chances at a football scholarship. He was hilarious though, and worked his ass off.


“What’s up, G,” he called when he saw me. “It’s been a slow night. You’re lucky.”


“Slow night means slow tips.”


“Word. I feel that. I only have a few hours left until I’m outta here. Marco should be in soon to take my place.”


I went to the front of the diner right as a man in a tan suit came in. It was rare to find someone like that in here this late at night but I assumed he was traveling for business or something. I took the notepad out of my apron and offered him a smile. Smiles always increase tips.


“What’ll you have, darling?”


“Water and coffee to start.” He scanned the menu. “And since my name is Toast, I’ll have three pieces of toast. Strawberry jelly too.”


I jotted down his order. “Your name is Toast?”


“Robert Toast.” He patted his pocket then gave me a business card. “I’m a real estate agent. I’m traveling to Texas for a convention.” He held up his briefcase. “You in the market for a new home?”


I winked. “Depends how much you tip me.”


I left him laughing and went to the prep area to hang the ticket for Penny. Wendy found me with a worried look on her face.


“He’s such a fucking asshole,” she whispered.


“Who?” I asked.


“Bill. He told me he wanted some chicken breasts . . . hold the chicken.”


We all knew Bill. He was a trucker with irregular hours, but preferred to drive at night. He usually ate at the diner before he got on the road. He was young, around my age, and he had a thick bushy mustache and wore very tight jeans that showed his bulge. All the waitresses at the diner knew he wore them to try to impress us but it had the opposite effect. He was boorish, lewd, and a pervert. I told Wendy to switch customers with me and she obliged.


“Ah, Grace,” Bill said as I approached him with his plate of waffles and bacon. “Two waitresses in one night. It’s not the first time I’ve had two women in one night.”


“I doubt it.”


I turned to go but he grabbed my wrist. “Hold on, girl.”


I jerked away. “Don’t touch me.”


“Feisty. I love em’ feisty.” He laughed harshly. “I dropped my straw on the floor. Can you bend down and get it for me? Bend really . . . really . . . low.”


“I’ll get a new one from the back.” I left before he could keep being a creep and went behind the counter to help a woman sitting with her young son. She had on a button-up shirt and her name tag said “Erin”. It was clear she’d worked all day in retail, probably a double shift. She looked absolutely exhausted but her child was wound up like a ball of energy. 


“How can I help you, ma’am.”


“Hash browns and two waffles. Does that sound good, Jonah?” Her son tapped his little fingers on the napkin box and giggled. The noise was an irritant to his mother who patted him gently to stop. He didn’t.


Feeling bad for the fatigued mother and wanting to help in any way I could, I got close to the little boy and acted like I was telling him a secret. “If you’ll stay on your best behavior, and don’t make a mess, I’ll give you some free ice cream later.”


Jonah’s face lit up and he looked at his mother for reassurance. She nodded then mouthed “Thank you” to me. The kid stopped tapping the box and sat very still.


Fifteen or twenty minutes went by like that. Wendy and I checked on the customers in the restaurant: Robert Toast, the real estate agent; Bill, the pervy truck driver; Erin, the mom and her little boy, Jonah. It was a small crowd but that was expected on a random weekday night. What happened next was unexpected.


My boyfriend, Peter Callen, came through the diner’s front doors in a mad panic. He had blood on his arm.


The customers stirred as Peter rushed to me.


“Grace! Grace! Lock the doors.”


“Peter, oh my God. You’re bleeding-”


“Lock the damn doors. Something is outside!”


I fumbled the key out of my pocket but Peter snatched it from my grasp. He ran to the front door and locked it, pulling at the doors to make sure the lock held. He ran past me and I saw he had a wound on his right arm.


Blood dotted the floor on his way to the back door. I heard him lock it too.


“What the hell are you doing?” Bill shouted when Peter came back into the seating area.


Peter jumped on one of the empty booths and peered through the large windows that faced the parking lot. “Something is out there. Something big.”


“Peter,” I gently touched his back. He swung around like a frightened child. “You’re bleeding on the table.”


He looked down at his wound. Small ribbons of ripped flesh made a line along his forearm. “Shit. I need to clean this up. It bit me. It fucking bit me!”


“What did?” Toast, the salesman, asked, hugging his briefcase.


Peter glared back through the window, into the deep dark night. “I don’t know. Some kind . . . some kind of dog or something. I came here to surprise you, Grace. I had flowers and everything, but something came out of the damn woods. It was fast . . . so . . . fast-”


He trailed off. I took him by the hand and helped him off the booth. “You’re safe now. Go to the bathroom and get cleaned up.”


“Unlock the fucking doors first,” Bill shouted. “I gotta leave soon.”


“Please stop cursing around my son,” Erin shouted back.


Peter looked around the room. “I had to lock the doors. If that thing got in . . .”


He trailed off again and searched the faces of everyone. Wendy and Penny were standing by the food pick-up area, watching intently at what was going on. Peter was always one to lead in a sticky situation. Me, Penny, and Wendy knew that. He was shrewd and didn’t spook easily, so his unraveled temperament made us all a little nervous. Something had happened. Something he couldn’t wrap his head around.


Peter continued. “I’ll get cleaned up and then we can call the police.” He held his stomach and winced. “I’ll unlock the doors when they get here. It’s not safe outside.”


He disappeared into the men’s bathroom while Bill protested. Everyone ignored him. Me, Penny, and Wendy knew if Peter was advising everyone to stay inside, then everyone should listen.


“A raccoon bites him and he wants to call the police?” Bill shouted. “This is bullshit.”


I felt the need to defend my boyfriend. “If Peter says we should stay then that’s what we should do. You don’t know what’s out there.”


Bill lit a cigarette and puffed out a plume of smoke under his mustache. He sarcastically looked out the window and pointed the lit end of his cigarette at the glass. “I see a few parked cars, some trees, and a big full moon. That’s it.”


Toast clutched his briefcase and looked back toward the bathrooms. “Do you hear that?”


His question was interrupted by a question from Erin. “Cops? Why does he want to call the cops?” Jonah was scared now from all the shouting. His eyes never left the dots of Peter’s blood on the tiled floor.


“Cops have guns. Guns mean safety,” Penny said from behind his kitchen window. 


Bill shook his head. “Cops won’t do anything except laugh their asses off when they find an overgrown rat running through the parking lot.”


“A rat couldn’t do that to Peter’s arm,” Wendy objected. “I’m not going outside until the cops get here.”


“I hear something,” the salesman said again. No one paid him any attention. Emotions were too high.


Wendy leaned against a wall, wringing a dry towel out over and over again. “Are there bears in Mississippi? Is there a bear outside?”


“A lion, a tiger, a bear, oh my,” Bill said with a huff.


Penny said, “This discussion is ridiculous. Everyone stays put until we know what’s going on.”


Bill stubbed his cigarette into an ashtray. “A lowlife fry cook isn’t gonna tell me what to do. Stay in the kitchen and keep your mouth shut.”


Penny hopped through the pick-up area window and paced past the counter. “Or what? What the hell are you gonna do if I don’t?”


Bill and Penny got into each other’s faces while Wendy and I shouted for them to call down. Erin shouted for everyone to stop scaring her child. Jonah was frowning now, tears welling in his eyes from the confrontation. The shouting intensified and emotions ran high. A fight was about to break out.


“Shut up and listen,” Toast shouted. Everyone stopped and turned to him. He was shaking and staring at the door to the men’s bathroom. Peter was in there. “Do you hear that?”


And we did. It was a light, crunching sound. The patter of something hitting against the bathroom walls came from behind the door and the entire group took a step closer to hear it better. 


“Peter?” I called out. “Are you okay?”


“He might have passed out from blood loss,” Penny said. His comment cinched my heart tightly. My boyfriend was not only wounded, he could potentially die? The thought crushed me. I started toward the bathroom door and twisted the knob.


As soon as the door’s latch disengaged, the door was rocketed open, hitting me back several feet. My eyesight went blurry and I felt a knot swelling on my forehead. My world spun around before finally coming back to focus on the open bathroom door. I thought I’d find Peter, apologizing for accidentally knocking me to the ground.


But it wasn’t Peter.


It was something else.


“Oh my God,” I mumbled and scurried backwards on the cold floor. Away from the monstrosity that was before me.


A thick furry body stood on four powerful legs. Clawed paws clattered on the tile floor. The head was oddly human and . . . . familiar.


“Peter?” I asked, astonished.


What remained of Peter’s face bent and gnarled under some internal pressure. His strong chin jutted forward into elongated jaws. His forehead scrunched down, forming the slope of a canine skull. His eyes drew back, the irises milking over then darkening like ink had been spilled into them. He opened his mouth and a guttural moan escaped, but not before his nose jutted forward and developed into a snarling snout. 


Wendy ran over and helped me to my feet. Everyone watched in horror as my boyfriend changed. 


Now, standing before us in the small hallway that led to the bathrooms, was no longer Peter, but some kind of bizarre wolf-like creature with a thick gray mane and hairy muscles rippling over its body. Black, soulless eyes regarded my wide-eyed stare. Tall hairy ears twitched and jerked at sounds unheard by human ears.


The creature lifted its lips to reveal a set of incredible teeth. Jagged, sharp, numerous. It looked more like the mouth of something out of the depths of the ocean than something that would live on land. The jaws unhinged, the lips drew back farther, and a deafening howl echoed around the diner.


We all covered our ears but the volume and pitch seemed to rattle me to my core.


The terrifying sound thrust everyone into action.


Bill lunged for the door and pulled the handles with all his might. The lock held. Toast scrambled over his table and fell onto the ground, his briefcase still gripped in his hands, then he followed Wendy and Penny who jumped behind the counter. Erin and Jonah ran to the far side of the diner and squatted between the jukebox and a booth.


I stood there, staring stupidly at the thing that used to be my boyfriend.


“Grace,” Penny yelled. “Get over here.”


My legs churned toward the counter just as the wolf leapt away from the bathroom. It moved with unbelievable speed, dodging potted plants and cardboard boxes with deft athleticism. I dove headlong over the counter and crashed into Wendy.


We heard Bill scream.


Penny slowly lifted his eyes above the counter. His face went pale and slack, then we squatted down again. He tucked his legs against his chest and put his head on his knees.


Bill’s wet pleas were replaced by grotesque sounds that filled the diner. A chorus of ripping flesh and snapping bones. I went to look but Penny clutched my arm and held me down. He shook his head intently. Whatever was happening, he didn’t want me to witness it.


We all stared at one another, in complete shock, until the noises of violence stopped. They were replaced by deep inhalations from near the front door - the sound a bloodhound makes when it discovers the scent of a favorite quarry. Claws clacked against the diner’s floor. Peter, or whatever it was, was moving away from the door and toward the corner of the room.


Toward the jukebox.


Erin and Jonah didn’t have much time.


I reached across Wendy, who silently sobbed, and grabbed a glass of Coca-Cola out of the mini-fridge. I hurled it toward the other side of the restaurant and it smashed loudly against the wall.


The slow-paced click-clack of canine paws stopped, turned, then jolted toward the sound.


I crawled to the far end of the counter and found the mother and her son in an embrace, heads buried into each other’s shoulders. “Erin,” I whispered. She turned and saw me and I waved her over. They left their spot behind the corner booth and ran to us.


Peter was faster.


The force at which the wolf-thing hit them slammed them into the jukebox. Sparks shot out then the internal mechanism began to play something, but the speed at which it played was so slow the instruments and voice formed hollow wailing bass notes. I reached out for the both of them, finding a small hand and latching onto it. I pulled with all my might to get them to safety behind the counter.


It was only Erin.


Jonah’s neck was fixed tightly between powerful jaws and his gurgling protests were immediately halted with a snap of teeth. I covered Erin’s mouth to prevent her from screaming while Penny held her back from doing something as stupid as trying to take on the beast bare-handed. It was no use . . . her son was dead.


My heart sank with the thought that Jonah would never get the ice cream I promised him.


Penny forcibly pulled the mother into the far side of the L-shaped counter. Wendy, Toast and I followed, scooting on the ground as silently as we could. My heart beat so loudly I knew Peter would be able to hear it with those monstrous ears. We all collected into the small space behind the counter, a huddled mass of appalled, anxious people who had no idea what was happening. People who had no idea how it was happening.


The warbled, low-pitched music seeping through the damaged jukebox ceased and there was a sudden palpable stillness in the air.


Deep inhalations started again, as did the soft clacks of claws on tile. Peter had transformed into something murderous. Something evil. A predator eager to slip some more prey between its teeth. Fortunately, the posture of being on all fours prevented him from easily seeing over the countertop, thank God. 


I didn’t know what was going on but I did know that once Peter turned the corner, we’d all be sitting ducks. We had to get out of sight. I motioned for Penny to go over the counter. He understood immediately but Erin was pale as a sheet. Her eyes were glossed over, a look of dissociation etched on her face. Her limbs were noodles. The only way to get her over the counter was to toss her over.


Peter moved closer, his deep breaths echoing off the wall that housed the jukebox. 


Wendy went over first while Penny manipulated Erin. She didn’t fight or talk. Toast wept silently while he slid over the smooth counter, doing a bad job of staying low and out of sight from Peter. I aided Penny with Erin, then he slid over too just as I saw long whiskers jut from the other side of the aisle.


The dark curve of a canine nose passed the threshold just as I slid over the opposite side of the counter.


Now we were back where we started, near the hallway, but we were out of sight from whatever the hell Peter had transformed into. Our backs were against the wooden foundation of the counter. To our left was the men’s bathroom. To the right was Bill’s body . . . and the front door.


The door!


I checked my pockets for the key before remembering that Peter . . . uh, human Peter . . . had taken it.


We were trapped inside.


Wendy touched my shoulder and pointed toward the stationary stools lined under the counter. She motioned there then back, signaling we had to get into the kitchen area. It was mostly enclosed and was the only place to hide. However, we would have to sneak past Peter to get there. It was our only option. I nodded, then tapped Penny.


Before I could gesture, Erin jumped to her feet.


Our attempts to stop her were in vain. Erin grabbed a steak knife from the counter and dove over the edge. She wailed her son’s name, bringing the knife up and down in a savage cutting motion. The rest of us looked at one another in rapt amazement. There was a sharp cracking of glass and of cans tumbling from their homes on shelves.


Then the screams started.


Knowing we were powerless to save her, we crawled like toddlers around the stationary stools, willing ourselves to stay low to avoid being seen. Or from seeing the devastation so close to us. 


We reached the short arm of the “L” and hesitated. Peter was crunching on something wet and tough. Between each slurp slipped out an unsatiated growl. He wanted more.


Penny was the first to hop through the open space of the counter and into the kitchen. He held the door open for Wendy. She hesitated once, found her inner strength, and made it across.


I was next and my legs felt like they were formed out of concrete. I concentrated on the door, on the signaling hands and faces of my coworkers, and began to push myself toward them. Toast blasted past me, causing me to stumble. He sauntered through the door.


I was left exposed in the middle of the open area.


Peter was lying down on the rubber mat next to the soda dispenser. He faced away from me. Thank God for small mercies. What wasn’t merciful was what he was doing to Erin’s body. An arm, severed at the shoulder, lay parallel to his bushy tail. Her torso rocked back and forth with every hinge of his jaws on her flesh. Her head lolled lazily on a bloody neck, her lifeless eyes piercing me like they were willing me to continue. To go on. To move, dammit!


I did.


With the four of us out of view in the kitchen, Penny flipped the small door bolt that fed into the floor. It wasn’t much protection against what lay outside so he began to stack boxes and crates against the door as silently as he could. He was sweating, his lips forming a soft prayer with each additional pound placed against the door for our protection. Every rattle of glass or tinkled of metal made me flinch.


“Is the backdoor locked?” Wendy whispered.


I nodded. “Peter locked it too.”


She wiped her eyes and gave me a combative stare. “Did he do that because he knew what was about to happen?”


Had the situation not called for silence, I would have slapped her. Peter . . . or, at least the old Peter I knew . . . would never do something like this. He had a good heart. He loved people.


He loved me.


I held her hands in my own. “Peter would never do that. You know that. Something . . . changed him.”


A fresh stream of tears rolled down her cheeks. “Then what do we do since both exits are locked?”


Toast was close now, eavesdropping to see what plan I would come up with. Penny stacked a cardboard box full of paper towels on the top of his barrier then joined the group. He, too, was waiting to hear our next move.


“Peter took my keys with him when he went into the bathroom. They must still be in there.”


“And?” Penny whispered.


“We need to get them.”


Toast sat on the floor and brought his briefcase into his lap.


Penny looked toward his makeshift barrier. “How do you expect us to do that?”


“We have to trap Peter or-”


“Or what?”


“Or fight.”


The small serving window became alive with violent life. Peter’s canine head filled the space and we all jumped back in surprise. The creature squirmed and jerked its torso but it couldn’t fit through the small opening. Sharp teeth snapped together like the sound of grotesque chimes. The movement shot globs of gore toward us - pieces of Erin.


“We’re trapped! We’re trapped,” Wendy screamed.


“No, we’re not,” Penny announced.


He had a saucepan in his hands. It was filled with the hot grease from the fry station he used for french fries.


He turned to me. “It’s time to fight.”


Before I could respond, Penny stepped toward Peter and hurled the hot grease onto his face. Skin sizzled. Flesh bubbled. The smell of burning dog fur filled the kitchen.


Peter fell away from the counter, whimpering and pawing at his snout. The four of us backed away to the far side of the kitchen, each finding something as a weapon: a knife, a ladle, a skillet, a broom. Our tools were meager but they gave us a sense of comfort to have something in our hands.


The barking shrieks of pain eventually softened to whines. Then Peter was silent. We didn’t dare look into the window to see where he was. Instead, we huddled together on the kitchen floor, silently praying that someone would find us soon. We stayed like that for a long time. A hour? Maybe three hours? Once fear overtakes your brain, time loses all meaning. Eventually Toast began to weep.


“I lied,” he mumbled through his tears.


Wendy grabbed his shoulder. “What are you talking about?”


“I lied about being a real estate agent.” He shook his head and stared at the dirty tile between his legs. “I used to be a real estate agent . . . but not anymore.”


I touched his hand, knowing he was having a breakdown. “It’s okay, Toast-”


“No, it’s not.” He wiped the snot from his nose. “I made a few bad deals . . .  got into debt . . . then I made a few more bad deals . . . and now my wife has left me and taken the kids. I’m a failure at real estate. A failure of a husband. A failure as a father.”


I touched his briefcase. “I thought you were going to Texas for a convention?”


His expression grew solemn when he spun the briefcase around and opened it. “I lied about that too. I was going to use this on myself in the parking lot.”


There were no papers in the briefcase. No folders full of files or real estate contracts. The only item was a pistol.


“Holy shit,” Penny whispered. “Is that thing loaded?”


Toast nodded. “I figured if I was going to die then why not have one last meal. I found this diner and decided I’d do it here . . . away from my family.” Toast planted his head on his knees and began to sob.


While Penny and Wendy consoled Toast, I secretly grabbed the pistol and checked the magazine. Toast was telling the truth. The pistol was fully loaded.


Suddenly my plan to fetch the key became a lot easier.


“Where are you going?” Wendy asked when I got to my feet.


“I’m going to get the key. We have to get the fuck out of here.”


I ignored Penny and Wendy’s protests and bellied up to the service window. Bloody paw prints made laps around the counter and dining area, but I didn’t see Peter. I knew he was close though.


I eased out of the window but when my feet touched the group there was a loud clang. I held my breath, wondering what the hell I landed on. Then there was another clang. And another.


“Grace! Grace, let me in!”


Marco, the backup cook, was standing outside the front door. He waved and smiled at me as I stood there in disbelief. Clang! Clang! He knocked on the glass door again and yelled. “Hurry up, Grace. Why are the doors locked? Wait, oh shit, are you holding a gun?”


Then he looked down and saw the mangled body of Bill.


A rabid snarl erupted down the hallway before a blur of fury charged. Marco only had time to brace himself before the hulking mass of fur and teeth exploded through the doors, buckling them off the hinges and sending shards of glass into the parking lot.


Marco, now covered in small scratches, quickly got to his feet and sprinted toward his car. Peter lay on what was left of the doors and I knew that Marco would make it. He’d get into his car, speed toward town, and soon every police officer in a hundred miles would be here to save us.


Then something dashed out of the dark woods and tackled Marco.


It was another wolf creature. Bigger than Peter.


I gasped and held the pistol tighter.


It was the one that originally bit Peter. It had been waiting in the woods. Waiting for us to escape the confines of the building. It had set a trap.


Knowing both creatures were at the front of the diner made a lightbulb go off in my brain. The backdoor. We could escape through the backdoor.


I ran into the bathroom where Peter had begun his transformation. Tattered clothes and blood littered the area. I found his jeans - well, parts of his jeans - and searched through damp pockets. My treasure hunt was successful.


I held the key up high like a mighty scepter. All I had to do now was unlock the backdoor and gather everyone through it. From there we could climb onto the roof and wait this thing out. We could spy on the creatures from above and stay quiet. My plan was fool-proof.


What I didn’t expect was that all the commotion going on alerted the people in the kitchen. They found the front door busted open. No creatures were in sight. No sounds were audible. To them, it appeared the coast was clear to make a break for it.


It was like watching something in slow motion when they left the safety of the kitchen. I spotted Penny first. He leaped over the broken door and made a break for his car. Wendy was behind him, sprinting toward her own car in the hopes that once she was inside it she was safe. Then there was Toast, who tripped on some glass and landed squarely on his ass right outside the diner.


I yelled out for them to return but my screams were muffled by a pair of harsh howls. I saw two dark shapes maneuver around the parked cars and interrupt my coworkers’ getaways. Claws tore through flesh. Teeth ripped bone. Tongues lapped up blood.


I witnessed both creatures turn their attention to Toast, who was still sitting and sobbing, as I unlocked the backdoor. Toast had lost his mind in the ongoing situation. He lifted his hands in subservience, mumbling incoherent wishes for these beasts to take away all his pain. He begged those gods of the night to end his suffering.


The screams I heard as I exited the building was enough evidence to know they answered his prayers.


My escape was quiet but my run to the wall ladder was not. I tripped over a cardboard box, then slipped on some grease leaking out of a garbage can. Once I found the ladder I conquered the rungs as fast as possible.


But they were so damn fast.


In an instant they were around the corner and lunged for my legs. The bigger one missed but Peter’s teeth grazed one of my calf muscles. I yelled in pain but kept moving up. My hands felt the cold rooftop and I hoisted myself over the roof ledge. I risked a peek over the edge to find the creatures were more intelligent than I’d believed.


They were attempting to climb the fucking ladder!


I aimed the pistol, eyed the sight, switched off the safety . . . and fired a round.


The big one toppled over, a gory hole in the center of its skull. Its death did nothing to hinder Peter’s ascent. Long claws gripped the rungs in cumbersome ways as he made his way to me. I fired a shot at Peter, my boyfriend, the man I loved.


It struck his shoulder but didn’t stop his progress.


Now he was within striking distance of me so I squirmed back to the far edge of the roof. A pair of furry ears sprouted above the ledge and I let off another round. Then another.


Peter continued.


I noticed how dark it had become outside. The once brilliant full moon was slipping past the horizon. Peter was nothing but a monstrous silhouette as he planted his paws on the roof. He no longer stayed on all fours but erected himself to his hind legs.


He charged.


I fired what remained of the bullets to the mass of motion and violence charging at me. Once the gun stopped firing, the magazine empty, I closed my eyes and waited for my death.


***


“Obviously, you didn’t die,” Detective Hartwig said. “What happened?”


Detective Cable looked at the documents in the folder. “Your original testimony says that when you opened your eyes you found Peter. Dead. He was shot in the shoulder, the chest, and the head.”


I nodded. “Yes. Peter was on the roof with me. Human Peter.”


The detectives traded glances. I knew they didn’t believe me. Just like the other police officers who arrived after the sun came up that day in 1987. Neighbors had heard the gunshots and called them. They arrived at a scene of carnage. A hundred explanations were presented, none of them similar to my story about what ACTUALLY happened. There must have been some kind of cover up. I shouldn’t have expected anything differently.


“What about the farmer?” Hartwig asked.


“Richard Bowler,” I answered. “He’d been missing from his home that night, according to his wife. She said he had been bitten by a large dog a few weeks prior. He was the bigger creature that originally bit Peter. After I shot him, he returned to human form.”


“Human form. Right.” Cable rolled his eyes.


Hartwig offered a fake smile. “You’ve been very helpful, Grace.”


The men gathered their folder and stood up from the table. It was clear they thought I was insane or outright lying. I wish I had been lying. My life would be so much different had I not gone into work that day.


Hartwig gave me his card. “We’re leading the investigation into the three missing people here in Edwards. If you remember anything else don’t hesitate to call.”


I took the card and nodded, knowing I would never call. There was plenty of information I could have told them that they didn't know. Like how I knew exactly what happened to the missing people. Like how careful I’d been all these years only to slip up over the last three months.


“If I remember anything I’ll definitely give you a call. Thanks, officers. I hope you find what you’re looking for.”


As they left the diner I felt an itch on my calf. I scratched the spot where Peter had bitten me all those years ago. Even in his altered state, Peter had left me with a gift so remarkable I’ve had to hide it from the world. Normally, I like to hunt in different states a thousand miles away from Mississippi, but recently I’ve been lazy. Prowling Edwards was a stupid idea and I’d have to be smarter from now on.

1g7fffx,https://www.reddit.com/r/AirForce/comments/1g7fffx/take_it_with_a_grain_of_salt/,Take it with a grain of salt…,"As I (SNCO) approach retirement, there are several things I’ve noticed about today’s Air Force. I’d like to discuss some of the misconceptions and conditions that exist. The biggest thing I can say is there is a major lack of personal accountability with a large portion of our force. This is my opinion as an old crusty, so take it for what it is. Here’s some advice based off of what I’ve observed over my almost 20 years in the Air Force:

1. I hear a lot of people complain about not winning awards and not making rank due to brown-nosers. This is true to some extent, but overall, if you are a great airman who works hard, comes to work on time, gives even 80% effort, is reliable, and serves with integrity, you will be successful and eventually make MSgt, at least. You may get passed over for an award or promotion statement here or there, but the shining stars are always discovered and acknowledged as such, eventually. A caveat to that is that, by definition, most people are just average. And that’s OK, too. If you literally just want to come to work, do your job and go home, that’s fine. Please just don’t ever complain about not winning awards or getting promoted.

2. People need to stop complaining! Life isn’t perfectly fair as we all know. Stop complaining when things don’t go your way. Pick yourself up and keep pressing forward.

3. Focus your mind on your own personal goals and career. Stop looking at everyone else’s success and comparing yourself to them. Everyone’s on their own journey. You’re going to drive yourself crazy worrying about everyone else and comparing yourself to them. Some people are taller, stronger, better looking, and more intelligent than others. That’s just the way it is. That’s the way it’s always been and that’s the way it always will be. Be grateful for what you have and stop always longing for the next thing that you don’t have. Life is much more fulfilling that way.

4. It’s best to stay out of people’s business to begin with, but people may come to you for advice. If you’re going to form an opinion, you must always hear both sides of the story. Always! Especially when it comes to people’s relationships. I can’t even tell you how many times I’ve talked to someone who got divorced and they talk about how terrible their spouse was. You immediately start to feel sympathy for them. But then you hear their spouse’s side of the story and it completely changes everything. They conveniently left out plenty of details. Stop judging based off of small pieces of information that you have even if they’re a good friend. A great example of this would be when Chief Bass roasted that one Pararescueman because she immediately took the side of a complaining spouse before actually digging into it and realizing that the complaining wife was a the issue.

5. This is a rough one to hear but I’ll stand by this firmly: If you’re fat it’s your fault. We have an obesity epidemic in America and it’s bled over into the Air Force. I understand people have their excuses, but at the end of the day it’s really calories in, calories out. I know there are very slight nuances to that but if you’re fat, you simply eat too much food. It really boils down to that. Eat less food. There was a group of about five people I worked with who were obese. Every single one of their significant others were also obese. This demonstrates an over-consumption culture within their household. They would always complain and play the victims, never once taking responsibility for what they eat. They would routinely snack on sugary delights, consume high sugar soda/coffee, and eat multiple large/unhealthy meals throughout the day. I’ve known dozens of people  through the years who decided to turn their lives around and eat better. They lost a ton of weight. What did they do different? They cut out sugars and limited their portions. There’s a misconception that exercise is the key. Exercise is certainly important. It helps general health and you SHOULD do it often, but if you don’t eat too many calories, you don’t need to burn extra calories. Our bodies naturally burn between ~1700-2200 cal by just existing. I would consider running 2 miles to be a very good workout. Running 2 miles will only burn 200 to 300 cal, roughly. That’s literally one zebra cake. Some people may say that they’re stressed and they eat to cope. I understand that, but it’s still on them. Some people who are stressed smoke crack or are abusive to their family. That’s not OK. There are healthy coping mechanisms (like meditation or exercise), and unhealthy coping mechanisms (like over-eating and smoking crack). We’re all responsible for our actions. We make that choice. And every single person has some degree of stress in their life that they have to cope with. Healthy food isn’t expensive like some say. And even then, you don’t even have to eat super healthy, just eat less food. And even if you’re “injured”, you can still exercise using modified workouts. Lastly, think to yourself: why are there so many thin/fit people? Because they’re just lucky to have good genetics? Or because they don’t eat too many calories. No more excuses, please. EVERYONE can be thin. 

6. We live in a free country. Fortunately, we get to pick our significant other (SO). Selecting who you will marry is one of the largest decisions you will ever make in your entire life. It requires discernment. It can literally make your life incredibly fulfilled, or full of decades of turmoil. It’s really on us who we end up with. I always decided that I was either going to be single, or get with a woman who is loving, loyal, sweet, trustworthy, honest, wholesome and took care of her body. There’s no compromise there. It’s one or the other. Conversely, I worked with several people who said nothing but terrible things about their ex. What I didn’t quite understand was this one woman - She publicly complained that her baby daddy was such a lazy bum. He would lay around, never want to get a job, and treated her like garbage. Why get with this guy in the first place? What’s interesting is that not only did she have one child but a few years later she had a second child with this same man. Birds of a feather flock together. It’s one thing to date someone like that a few times to see if that’s how they really are. It’s another thing to sleep with them and have kids with them. If you’re complaining endlessly about someone who you were willing to bring multiple children into the world with, you need to start looking internally. Stop complaining because you’re probably not too far off of how you describe your SO to be. Our SOs are a very large reflection of our self-esteem, and who we see ourselves as. Choose very very very wisely. Have standards and boundaries and do not deviate from them. It’s your choice. Use discernment because who you choose to marry is one of the largest decisions you will ever make.

7. Always seek feedback. Nobody’s perfect; I am certainly not. We all have blindspots and things to improve on. It’s important that we try to figure out what our blindspots are so we can become better people and better leaders. People are so afraid of feedback because it can hurt their feelings and make them feel inadequate. But it’s like ripping off a Band-Aid. It hurts at first, but it will make you better.

8. Be a true Wingman. I know this is cliché, but we need to look out for each other. There are those people who are in it solely for themselves and step on others just to get ahead. Those people are identified quickly and everyone despises them. Be a trustworthy human and look out for the well-being of your Wingmen. Don’t talk behind each other’s back, and have your subordinates’ best interest at heart. People will see this and you will gain tremendous respect for doing such. Be genuine, honest, and upfront. This goes a long way.

9. Always seek self improvement. That can include taking free (TA funded) classes towards your degree, learning new skills, working out to improve physical appearance, or attending social gatherings to work on social skills just to name a few. You are free to do whatever you wish with your time within the letter of the law. But if you barricade yourself in your room and play 6 hours of video games each night, you can’t complain about other deficiencies in your life that you could be improving upon. 

TL;DR - Take responsibility and ownership of your life. A great deal of our problems are caused by the poor choices that we make. You reap what you sow. Your life will be so much better if you do this. I promise!

Went down to the hotel coffee lobby, which you don't see when checking in, and there he was. Right in the middle, set apart from the other cushions with names. The ghostly homeless guy across the street made it a little spooky.

My Nmom owns a house and a very successful dog training business. Most of my life I have tried at every moment to show interest in the kennel as it’s what I wanted too do, still what I want too do. 
She has made it clear that despite my work my take over is not guaranteed. She also does nothing too teach me what I need too know. 
She makes me work sometimes 7 days a week but cuts my hours so she doesn’t pay me overtime. (Too all staff)
Today in the house work was brought up and I mention my distaste for her bringing up work before I have had my coffee. 
She turned it around and threatened too kick me out and said that employees are replaceable.
I have asked many people, friends, family, professions, for help and nothing in my household changes. 
Many professions have suggested a change in employment or even housing situations but if I can learn too put up with it I may inherit something worth it. 

For years I have felt like a disappointment, whenever I’m with my nmom. 
When I was young I was sent away for anger issues so I don’t believe I’m totally innocent. However every time I go to have a calm conversation I get put down and leave somehow feeling like everything was my fault and I need too change. 
I think everyone needs too change. The work should be ever changing that’s how we improve. What do I do when the parent of the house doesn’t feel this way? 
My father was out of the picture years ago and she let me have the final say weather he stays but when I think back too it the amount of bad things she would say about him probably impacted my decision. 
Needless too say he still was a bad person and he’s not in my life and will not be returning. She’s all I’ve got. 
From this sub I have gained an understanding that the quote I have been told my whole life, “you only have one mom treat her well”, is phrased wrong. I think it should be “you only have one mom so give her extra chances”. 

I also need too mention she pays my bills allowing me too save and if I moved I have a lot of stuff (trailers, quads, and other hobbies I tried too use too find myself) that more than likely won’t be able too come. She does hold that over my head so it’s difficult too get a productive conversation with her. She did try too implement rent but it was around $3-400 more than what I make in a month and she new that. It was not including my car utilities and car insurance.

I would really like too drop $500 and say “congrats here’s my months rent, if you take this I will be a renter and an employee and that’s all” (at least until I can find a good situation for housing) but I’m afraid I will just be wasting money as she won’t understand that by taking it she has just severed ties with someone she claims too want a relationship with. 

So the business is obviously a large factor in me staying but I don’t want to use her no matter how much I feel she deserves it. I would much rather inherit it on good terms. 
I’m afraid that “good terms” may never come and my question is: 

How much mental anguish should I put up with before I decide to cut her out of my life? How do I know that I’m not just torturing myself for no reason? ",2,1729361505.0,narcissisticparents,1,1.0,False

I'm a city person, so ideally I'd want a place with a ""town center"" feel that has coffee shops, restaurants, shops, etc. Any suggestions would be VERY much appreciated!",4,1729361493.0,Veterans,15,0.67,False
