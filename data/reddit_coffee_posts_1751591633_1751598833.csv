By Nora Roberts","After a devastating car accident leaves her hospitalized, Willow Rose realizes that her mate, Asher Myers, has chosen to save another woman—his childhood sweetheart, rather than her. Heartbroken and betrayed, Willow decides to leave the Silver Fang Pack to heal and start anew, severing their mate bond for good. As she rebuilds her life with the support of Landon Lopez, Alpha of the Crimson Ridge Pack, Willow discovers her own strength and learns that love should never come at the cost of one’s dignity.

# Chapter 1 - He Chose Her: My Husband's Ultimate Betrayal

My world imploded as, suspended thousands of feet in the air facing potential death, my husband, Mathew, didn’t hesitate for even a split second before choosing Milana—his so-called ""dream girl"" and past obsession—over me, his wife.

It all unfolded on my thirtieth birthday, when Mathew, in what I thought was a romantic gesture, chartered a helicopter ride for us. To my utter disbelief, Milana, the woman he’d always idealized, was joining us. Mid-flight, disaster struck in the form of a sudden mechanical failure, and we discovered there were only two parachutes onboard.

Mathew was presented with an impossible choice: save himself and me, or ensure Milana's survival.

Without a moment's hesitation, he chose her.

“Milana’s life is just beginning; she has so much ahead of her. I can’t bear the thought of her dying,” he declared, his voice laced with what sounded like genuine anguish. “Don’t worry, Sophia, the moment we’re safe, I’ll send help back for you.”

What he didn’t realize was that this so-called malfunction wasn’t accidental. It was a test, a cruel and desperate measure I'd orchestrated to expose his true feelings.

As Mathew meticulously secured Milana in her parachute, his face was etched with nothing but urgency and raw fear—afraid his precious Milana might be harmed. I watched, a silent observer to my own heartbreak. He then strapped on the second parachute, grasped Milana’s hand tightly, and prepared to jump. Just before they leaped into the void, he cast a fleeting glance back at me.

“Sophia, please, try to understand,” he pleaded, his voice strained. “You’ve always had everything, a life of privilege and comfort. Milana hasn’t been so fortunate.”

Did that mean she deserved to live more than I did? The question burned in my throat, but the words remained unspoken, trapped by the sheer weight of betrayal. With their fingers entwined, Mathew and Milana jumped from the helicopter and into the abyss. I pressed a button on the control panel, and the malfunction warning light blinked off, the illusion of danger dispelled.

As I watched the two of them locked in a desperate embrace against the backdrop of the clouds, my heart shattered into a million irreparable pieces.

....

Today was not only my thirtieth birthday but also marked seven years since Mathew and I began our life together. We had met because of our shared passion for aviation, and now, with a cruel twist of fate, it seemed fitting that our relationship should end in the same realm. Resolutely, I slid into the pilot's seat and navigated the helicopter back to the base alone.

Once back on solid ground, I changed into comfortable clothes, and I couldn't help but overhear the hushed whispers of the staff.

""Did you hear about Mathew Rogers? He took his dream girl skydiving, and something went terribly wrong.""

""Milana Hudson is seriously injured and in the hospital. I heard Mathew even spared no expense, hiring a whole team of specialists for her treatment.""

""They said he's on his knees outside the operating room, practically begging for her to pull through.""

Each word was like a shard of ice piercing my heart, each whisper a fresh wave of pain. My fists clenched so tightly that my nails broke the skin, drawing blood.

I reached for my phone and called my grandfather's close friend, Reed, who manages a helicopter adventure company nestled in the Alps. He’d extended countless invitations for me to work there as an instructor, but I always declined, prioritizing Mathew and our daughter, Lottie. Now, finally, I felt ready, even eager, to accept his offer.

Reed was overjoyed to hear from me and to learn of my decision. ""Sophia! That's wonderful news! I'll arrange for someone to collect you; they'll be there the day after tomorrow.""

""Thank you, Grandpa Berry.""

After ending the call, I noticed that Mathew had updated his social media. It was a picture expressing desperate hope, captioned: ""Please, let her be okay.""

The comments section below was flooded with well-wishers assuming he was referring to me, his wife of seven years.

""Mathew, is everything alright? Has something happened to your wife? Do you need anything?""

""Is everything okay with Sophia and the baby?""

Mathew replied to each query individually: ""It's not Sophia; it's Milana who was in the accident.""

My heart plummeted, a lone tear escaping and landing on my phone screen. Mathew and I had first crossed paths at the helicopter base when he was just a young, enthusiastic instructor. Over time, our bond deepened, and he eventually confessed his feelings for me. I was five years his senior and initially believed our relationship was doomed, but he was relentless, showering me with flowers, thoughtful gifts, and unwavering attention. He even once bravely intervened when I was being mugged. Eventually, I surrendered and agreed to be with him.

In the initial years of our marriage, we were deeply in love, and he treated me like a queen. But all too soon, subtle cracks began to appear, revealing signs of his infidelity. I found old photos tucked away in the trash of him and Milana in bed, and I discovered bank statements detailing regular transfers of money to her account. Despite everything, despite the mounting evidence of his betrayal, I found myself unable to leave him, a prisoner of my own love. So, I endured it, time and time again, burying the pain deep within.

# Chapter 2 - My Husband's Obsession

I found myself at the sterile hospital, scheduling the procedure that would end my pregnancy. Five months along, and she was perfect, a miniature human already. Ivan Medina, the doctor, stared at me, a question etched on his face. ""The baby is perfectly healthy, no complications. Are you absolutely certain you want to proceed?"" he asked, his voice laced with disbelief.

""I'm certain,"" I managed to choke out, each word a shard of glass in my throat. What choice did I have? Bringing a child into a world where she'd be unwanted, unloved… it would be the height of irresponsibility.

When I first discovered I was pregnant, Mathew Rogers had been ecstatic. He'd plastered social media with announcements, declaring himself a soon-to-be father, promising to be a changed man. He'd quit smoking, ditched the late nights with the boys, and showered me with gifts, never missing an anniversary or special occasion. Every night, he'd whisper promises in my ear. How could such a loving man be capable of such betrayal? I’d chosen to ignore it, clinging to the illusion.

Clutching the appointment card, I turned to leave when I spotted Mathew down the hall. He was slumped in a chair, his face buried in his hands, his shoulders shaking.

""Milana, please be okay. I can't live without you."" He seemed to have completely forgotten about saving me from the plane crash.

A chilling thought struck me: If I hadn't staged the incident today, would I have simply disappeared with the wreckage? As if sensing my presence, Mathew looked up, his eyes widening in shock.

""Sophia? What are you doing here?"" The realization dawned on his face. ""You're alright?""

""Yes, I'm fine,"" I replied, walking towards him, my voice steady.

His face contorted in rage. ""It was you, wasn't it? You sabotaged the plane. You tried to hurt Milana. How could you be so cruel?"" He seized my face, his fingers digging into my cheekbones.

""Yes, I planned it,"" I admitted, forcing myself to meet his gaze. I needed to see how far he'd go for her. His jaw tightened, a muscle ticking in his cheek.

""Sophia, why? Milana just beat cancer. She's finally starting her life. Why would you try to destroy that? If anything happens to her, I swear, you'll pay.""

It was almost comical—my husband threatening me for another woman. My faint smile only seemed to infuriate him more, his grip intensifying.

""Sophia! You vicious, cold-hearted bitch. I regret ever marrying you."" The words hung in the air. I was about to tell him the feeling was mutual when Ivan Medina emerged from the operating room.

""The patient is stable,"" he announced, his voice calm and professional.

In that instant, the light returned to Mathew's eyes. The fight drained out of me, and I crumbled to the floor, my cheek throbbing where he'd grabbed me. In that moment, I understood that the young man who had once held me close, whispering, ""Sophia, you're mine forever,"" was gone, lost to me forever.

\---

Milana was wheeled into a private room, while Mathew pinned me against the wall, demanding an apology.

""Sophia, apologize to Milana now! Or so help me, you'll regret this!"" he snarled.

Milana, pale and weak in the bed, murmured, ""I'm… I'm alright, Mathew. Don’t get angry because of me. It’s okay even if I don’t make it.""

Mathew rushed to her side, his face etched with concern. ""Don't talk like that, Milana. You're the most amazing woman in the world. You have to get better. I still want to take you to Scotland and see the Highlands, visit all those places we talked about.""

Once, I had dreamed of exploring the Scottish Highlands with Mathew. He had promised me, ""I'll take you there, Sophia."" Now, he didn't even remember. I should have realized long ago—I was no longer part of his plans.

First, there was the affair in our car. Then, the helicopter ride, the helicopter emblazoned with their names. Each transgression had chipped away at my heart, leaving it raw and bleeding.

""Sophia, this is all your fault. If it weren't for you, none of this would have happened to Milana,"" Mathew roared, grabbing a fistful of my hair. He raised his hand, ready to strike, but stopped, remembering the child I carried.

""Sophia, if you ever try anything like this again, I'll ruin your family, bankrupt them."" But he didn't understand. I no longer cared about money, about my family's reputation. All I wanted was out. I wanted a divorce.

# Chapter 3 - My Husband's Midlife Crisis

Mathew excused himself mid-conversation, claiming he needed to fetch Milana some coffee. He shot me a look that could kill. ""Lay one wrong finger on Milana, Sophia, and you'll regret it.""

Milana, bless her heart, gave me a knowing look and chuckled. ""You lost.""

Damn right, I lost.

Yesterday's harebrained scheme, cooked up between Milana and me, was supposed to gauge Mathew's true feelings during that ridiculous helicopter ride. The results were in: Mathew's heart belonged to her, no contest.

""You should divorce Mathew and get out of this town."" I told her softly.

""I know.""

My voice was barely a whisper.

""After my procedure, I'm leaving.""

""I wish you and Mathew all the happiness in the world."" The words felt like ash in my mouth.

Suddenly, tears streamed down her face. ""Sophia, please, just let me go. Stop doing this to me.""

""I really do love Mathew. We already messed things up once before. I can't lose him again.""

Before I could blink, Mathew was back, a storm cloud in his eyes. He grabbed a fistful of my hair, yanking my head up so I was forced to meet his furious gaze.

""Sophia Ryan, didn't I warn you to keep your hands off Milana?""

""Are you even listening to me?""

Where was the gentle boy who used to speak to me with such tenderness? Now, he was nothing but harsh and unforgiving. Maybe getting out was the only option left.

Milana watched the scene unfold from the bed, a smug look plastered across her face.

I didn't have the fight left in me.

""Mathew, if you care so much about Milana, if you love her that much, let's just get a divorce.""

His pupils constricted, like a cornered animal.

He looked genuinely stunned, as if the idea had never even crossed his mind. ""You want a divorce?"" The disbelief was thick in his voice.

""Yes. Let's head down to the courthouse now, while they're still open.""

""Sophia!"" His anger flared, raw and untamed. ""This is all your fault! You almost hurt Milana!""

""And now you're throwing a childish fit and demanding a divorce? Have you completely lost it?""

""Maybe I have."" I met his gaze, and a memory flashed: just yesterday, he'd held me close, whispering, ""Sophia, do you want a son or a daughter?""

""A son,"" I'd replied, ""as strong as you. Then there'd be two of you to protect me.""

""You'll get your wish.""

Today, he'd shattered that dream into a million pieces.

Seven years. Seven years down the drain.

""Mathew, I want a divorce.""

""I'll be waiting for you at the courthouse.""

After I walked out, a flurry of messages flooded my WhatsApp.

\[Yes, Milana still means something to me, but nothing happened. I still love you more, so what's with this overreaction?\]

\[Sophia, you're not getting any younger. Who else is going to want you if you leave me?\]

\[Just stop this nonsense, okay?\]

Reading his words, I was transported back to our early days.

He always called me ""big sis"" back then.

""Big sis, you're so beautiful. I want to love you forever.""

I'd asked him if he'd ever be disgusted by me when I got old.

He'd looked me dead in the eye, unwavering. ""Never. I'll love you well for the rest of my life.""

""Sophia, I choose you.""

Now, those promises were just hollow echoes.

I spent the entire afternoon cooling my heels at the courthouse, but Mathew never showed.

I finally called him. ""Sophia, I'm not divorcing you,"" he said.

""We've been together too long. I'm not just going to throw it all away like that.""

I couldn't wrap my head around it. If he loved Milana so much, why wouldn't he just let me go?

""Mathew, I know you've always been tangled up with Milana.""

""I also know how much you care about her. I'm setting you free, so you can give her the life she deserves."" My heart felt numb, incapable of beating for him any longer.

He sounded dumbstruck on the other end, probably shocked that I knew the truth.

There's a saying: You see how they love you, so you know immediately when they don't.

That's exactly how it was with Mathew.

He'd once loved me deeply; now that his feelings had shifted, the change was glaringly obvious.

""I'm not really in love with her. I'm just trying to recapture something I missed out on in my youth.""

""Sophia, don't take it so hard. This is just a phase. I'll get over it.""

It was clear I'd never get him to come to the courthouse and sign the papers.

So, I hung up and dialed Alma, Mathew's mother.

# Chapter 4 - My Ex's Insta-Worthy Upgrade

The news of my decision clearly blindsided Alma Russell. When I first told her about going through with the procedure, she looked genuinely shocked, even pleading with me to reconsider. But my mind was made up.

But when Stanley’s pack crumbles and his true love fades, he returns, pleading for another chance.

# Chapter 1 - ""From Ashes to Rivalry""

Stanley Griffin, my former mate and the Alpha of the Silver Moon Pack, fell in love with my sister, Lottie Russell, claiming she was gentle and serene, unlike my fiery and headstrong nature.

I laughed. He seemed to forget that it was precisely my fiery and headstrong personality that helped him rise from the ashes and establish a pack of thousands.

At a pack gathering, he got drunk and confided in his Betas, ""I want to follow my heart and pursue what I truly love, not settle for a lifetime with Madilyn Lawrence.""

Later, I let him go, allowing him to chase his true love.

Meanwhile, I started over with my trusted team, pouring my heart into my new role as Gamma in the Crimson Fang Pack.

He seemed to regret it. Seeing his pack in shambles and his once-beloved now just a shadow of her former self, he begged me for another chance.

==============================

Stanley Griffin came to my office while I was in a meeting.

My team tactfully left the room.

I smirked, ""What, didn’t you go after your true love?""

He opened his mouth but ultimately said nothing.

""Madilyn, I was drunk that night, you…""

I cut him off impatiently, ""What you do is none of my concern.""

I had been devoted to Stanley for seven years, making his pack my priority, his moods my compass.

Yet, I still ended up being his second choice.

Watching him struggle to retort but hold back gave me immense satisfaction.

A month ago, it was Lottie Russell who mocked me in front of him:

""Sister, how could you not even keep your own mate?""

At that time, Stanley gently held her, as if she were the most precious treasure in the world, and whispered softly,

""How could she ever compare to you?""

==============================

For seven years, Stanley had been hot and cold with me.

Even though I stuck to him like glue, he remained indifferent.

I would wait at home with dinner ready, sometimes until two or three in the morning.

He would come home reeking of alcohol, his breath tinged with the faint smell of tobacco.

His rough kisses would land on my ear, collarbone, and further down…

I closed my eyes, my lashes fluttering, feeling his presence.

Only in those moments would he come close to me.

The next morning, the other side of the bed would be cold, as if he had never been there.

I laughed at myself. Back then, I was so naive to think that my companionship could warm his heart.

While I was foolishly waiting,

He was living out the dream I could never attain with Lottie.

I was such a fool, silent and blind.

==============================

Now, the only thing I feel grateful for is that,

During those seven years, I helped him manage the pack, negotiating with different packs every day, exhausting myself.

Lottie took advantage of this gap to develop a relationship with Stanley, engaging in their clandestine affair.

Little did I know that those years of being his loyal servant would give me a chance to start over.

I have the resources, connections, and leadership skills. What do you have to hold me back?

==============================

Just as my pack was thriving, disaster struck.

Aside from a few initial media reports about Stanley, his scandalous affair, which should have rocked the werewolf community, barely made a ripple.

Such a big story going unreported? It was obvious Richard Griffin, the Lycan Prince, had a hand in it.

Expected, after all, the elite care about their image.

What I didn’t expect was the Griffins turning the tables, buying trending hashtags.

Now, everyone in G City knows that the Griffin heir’s mate led a scandalous life, trying to marry into wealth and being rejected.

Years of hard work gone to waste, and the younger man I was rumored to be involved with left too.

I laughed in anger.

Many pack alliances terminated their contracts with my pack due to the rumors.

In the blink of an eye, the pack’s situation took a nosedive, teetering on the brink.

That’s when Brycen Elliott returned.

==============================

The Elliotts and the Lawrences were close family friends. Brycen was originally my mate, but I was so infatuated with Stanley that I gently rejected his feelings.

Unable to change my mind, he chose to stay out of sight, spending the last few years in a distant pack.

He had heard about my situation and rushed back from the U.S.

Bringing with him the connections and resources he had accumulated over the years.

Brycen and I had grown up together, and our默契 was such that we didn’t even need to speak to understand each other. I trusted him completely.

With his help, the pack’s situation improved significantly.

I began to expand new alliances based on my experience from working at Stanley’s pack,

Slowly forming a rivalry with Stanley’s pack.

The war between Stanley and me had just begun when the unscrupulous media started stirring up trouble again,

With headlines like ""Long-time lover steps in to lend a hand"" and ""Stanley and his lover as close as brothers, betrayed by deceit.""

I rolled my eyes, turning to Brycen, who was organizing files behind me, and bowed slightly.

""Sorry, sorry. Bear with it for a while, and I’ll clear your name.""

He smiled, his gaze locking onto mine.

""No big deal.""

# Chapter 2 - ""Echoes of a Broken Bond""

I thought Stanley and I would never cross paths again, at most, we’d be rivals in the pack hierarchy.

But in the midst of a fierce territorial dispute, he abruptly sold his pack’s territory.

I heard Richard Griffin, the Lycan Prince, was furious and threatened to disown him.

Lottie, being shrewd, saw that Stanley’s fortunes were dwindling and distanced herself early on.

I couldn’t help but wonder what had possessed him to do something so reckless.

Soon, I found out.

That evening, as I returned to my den, he cornered me in the narrow space by the door.

The familiar faint scent of tobacco enveloped me.

“Madilyn, I’ve missed you.”

He silently wrapped his arms around me from behind, his touch unexpectedly gentle.

He carried a faint whiff of alcohol, and I found myself wondering what he had been drinking today—it seemed different from before.

Suddenly, alarm bells rang in my head, and I forcefully broke free from his embrace. The dim light cast fragmented shadows in his eyes, and he raised an eyebrow slightly, his voice tinged with confusion.

“Madilyn?”

I wiped the corner of my eye, a wave of inexplicable disgust rising within me. I took a deep breath, trying to steady my emotions.

“What are you doing here? This is my territory.”

I stared directly at his slightly haggard face, a mix of complex emotions swirling inside me.

“Madilyn, I was wrong this time. I promise I won’t get involved with any other she-wolves again.”

I looked at him coldly, saying nothing.

He seemed startled by the icy look in my eyes, his hand awkwardly suspended in the air.

“Madilyn, enough of this. Don’t make a scene,” he said softly, reaching out to pull me closer.

“Who’s making a scene?”

“Cut me some slack. Everyone makes mistakes.”

“When I don’t like you anymore, don’t come bothering me. Who do you think you are?”

I took a few steps back, looking at him with mockery.

I finally realized how naive I had been, thinking that pretending not to know would keep him mine forever.

Thinking that forgiving him time and time again would move him.

Love can’t be earned through pity.

In the darkness, he was silent for a long moment.

“What do you want from me?”

I raised an eyebrow dramatically, glancing at him sideways.

“What do I want? I want you to get lost.”

“Don’t disturb me and Brycen.”

The next morning, I woke up at noon.

After spewing those harsh words last night, I slammed the door and left Stanley outside, going to sleep on my own.

Rubbing my temples, I realized I hadn’t slept well at all.

In my dreams, scenes overlapped, and I repeatedly witnessed Stanley at pack gatherings, in bars, flirting with different she-wolves.

Ugh, what a nightmare.

He’s the kind of Alpha who’s used to being the center of attention, treating love like a charitable handout.

He seems to have forgotten that he thought others’ admiration was based on what they could gain from him.

Once, someone loved his temper, his vulnerability, but he saw it as a loss of face.

True, pure love—he thought it was cheap.

Opening my work phone, 99+ messages flooded in.

My head was spinning.

Brycen’s call came through at that moment.

“Madilyn, where are you?”

Rubbing my temples, I sighed.

“At my den. What’s up?”

“There’s a negotiation this afternoon with the VP of the Moonstone Pack. I think you should meet them.”

The sunlight filtered through the thin clouds, casting a warm glow over the bustling city streets.

When I arrived at the pack headquarters, Brycen was already waiting for me downstairs.

Today, he wore a dark casual suit paired with a crisp white shirt, the collar slightly open, exuding a relaxed yet elegant vibe.

His tie was a solid color, complementing the suit and shirt, neither too flashy nor too plain. His dark straight-leg pants were perfectly tailored, neither too tight nor too loose.

On his feet were black leather shoes, smooth and unadorned, yet exuding a subtle luxury.

Nothing like Stanley’s flashy peacock style.

Tsk tsk, those long legs, that broad shoulders and narrow waist—what a sight.

As I approached, he seemed to sense my presence and looked up, handing me an Americano. A faint cedar scent wafted from his sleeves, his signature cologne.

“Madilyn.”

I took the coffee.

“Let’s talk inside.”

# Chapter 3 - ""Ravioli, Rivalries, and Reminders""

The discussion lasted the entire afternoon, and by the time all the details were finalized, the city lights had already illuminated the night outside.

""Madilyn, let's go grab some of Alfredo’s ravioli,"" Brycen said as he gently draped a coat over my shoulders from behind.

I remember when I was a pup, I’d knock on Brycen’s door whenever I got hungry at night, and he’d take me to a small alley not far from home for ravioli. The pasta was thin, the filling generous, and they were always piping hot. We’d both eat until we were sweating, and Brycen would fan me while holding a chilled soda to my lips.

Since we went there so often, Alfredo, the pack’s Healer, got to know us and would often sneak a few shrimp-filled ravioli into our bowl of pork ones.

As those memories surfaced, I couldn’t help but smile softly. Those were the best days of our lives.

""Alright, let’s bring something for Alfredo too,"" I said.

He smirked. ""Sure.""

He took me to a nearby supermarket. I had intended to buy some health supplements for Alfredo, but in the fresh produce section, I spotted a familiar figure—Alpha Stanley Griffin.

He saw me too, and Brycen, who was pushing the cart beside me.

========================================

What followed was a scene straight out of a dramatic soap opera.

His eyes first lit up like a shooting star streaking across a dark sky, a brief flash of brilliance in the deep blackness. Then, just as quickly, the star plummeted to the ground, stirring up a whirlwind of dust, igniting a fiery blaze.

Alpha Stanley strode over to me in three quick steps, bringing a gust of wind with him.

He first lifted his chin, giving Brycen a cool, appraising glance, his posture immediately turning defensive. Then he turned to me, his voice tinged with a hint of grievance.

""Madilyn, didn’t you always say you wanted to try my cooking? I thought you’d be coming home soon, so I came out to buy some ingredients to make you dinner.""

Before I could respond, Brycen turned his head and spoke calmly, ""Madilyn, I know you’re compassionate, but you shouldn’t just bring any stray home. You never know what hidden motives they might have.""

""Yeah, trying to lay a hand on someone else’s mate. People might start thinking you have some kind of weird obsession.""

""Madilyn doesn’t like to make a fuss, but don’t think for a second that you’re worthy of her.""

""Since when did our business become your concern, outsider?""

""Who’s the outsider here, Alpha Stanley?""

I listened to their thinly veiled barbs, feeling like I was caught in the middle of a childish spat. Rubbing my temples, I finally interjected, ""Alright, we’ve got what we need. Let’s go?""

""Let’s go.""

""Let’s go.""

Both voices rang out simultaneously, one clear and cool, the other deep and resonant, but both equally dangerous.

It was clear that this wasn’t going to end easily.

""You…"" I turned to Alpha Stanley, forcing myself to meet his gaze. ""Don’t come bothering me again.""

I didn’t understand. He was the one who had cheated, so why did his eyes still hold such clarity?

I mentally scoffed. Alphas will always be Alphas, putting on a facade with such confidence, as if it were real.

========================================

It was getting late, and Alfredo was about to close up shop when he saw us and welcomed us in with a warm smile.

Alfredo’s hair had grown whiter, his back more hunched, and he was always coughing now.

Time silently slipped by, and certain moments served as reminders that some things were gone forever.

The ravioli still tasted the same as I remembered, but now we were all grown up.

At the next table sat a father and son. The father was feeding his son bite by bite. At his feet was a burlap sack. When he noticed me looking their way, he gave a simple smile and opened the sack slightly, pulling out two bright orange tangerines.

""Here, miss, try these. They’re from our own garden.""

I took them and thanked him. They were sweet.

After we finished eating, Brycen drove me home.

As we said goodbye, he gave me a gentle hug.

""Madilyn, if you need anything, call me.""

His embrace was warm and comforting. I took a deep breath. ""Alright.""

Everything was getting better, after all.

Even if I had a bit of grass growing on my head, I’d plant flowers in it.

I was a modern, independent she-wolf. Love couldn’t tie me down.

But then, almost immediately, I saw Alpha Stanley crouched by my doorstep, a bunch of green vegetables and bags of red and white meat beside him.

Hearing the sound, he quickly looked up.

Just like he was at home.

His eyes were still a bit moist. Yeah, even more like it.

I couldn’t keep smiling.

By E.R. Calloway","Three years ago, a car accident shattered Roselyn’s dreams of becoming a star dancer. Patrick King, her devoted fiancé, promised to care for her forever, convincing her to marry him. But on their wedding night, Patrick abandoned her to attend the debut of Ivanna Shaw, the company’s new lead dancer. As Roselyn uncovers Patrick’s betrayal and the truth behind the accident, she realizes her marriage is built on lies. Now, she’s determined to leave him—and make him pay. But as secrets unravel, Roselyn discovers Patrick’s motives may be darker than she ever imagined. What really happened that fateful night? And how far will Patrick go to keep the truth buried?

# Chapter 1 - The Shattered Dream and the Betrayal

The car accident three years ago shattered my dreams of ever stepping onto the stage I loved so dearly.

Patrick King told me it was just an unfortunate accident, and that if I married him, he would take care of me for the rest of my life.

But on our wedding night, he left me alone to attend the debut performance of Ivanna Shaw, the company’s new lead dancer.

When I presented the divorce papers to set us free, Patrick flew into a rage, demanding to know why I didn’t love him anymore, why I wanted a divorce.

Why? Because back then, I didn’t know that he was the one who had crushed my dreams with his own hands.

Now that the truth is out, of course I want a divorce, and more than that, I want Patrick to lose everything.

==============================

On the night of our wedding, Patrick didn’t come home.

Instead, he went to support Ivanna Shaw’s debut performance as the new lead dancer.

I stared at the gossip news popping up on my phone.

""Why did Mr. King abandon his new wife on their wedding night to attend Ivanna Shaw’s performance?""

""Is there something going on between Mr. King and Ivanna Shaw?""

""Was Mr. King’s marriage to his new wife truly out of love?""

I couldn’t believe it. Patrick had always been so good to me, never putting me in such an embarrassing position before.

But the Patrick who had just completed our wedding ceremony today seemed like a completely different person.

In disbelief, I called Patrick’s number.

A girl answered on the other end—it was Ivanna Shaw.

She said Patrick was in the shower and wouldn’t be coming home tonight.

Then, what sounded like Patrick’s voice came through, distant, as if he was far away.

He was telling Ivanna to hurry up and shower, as if he couldn’t wait.

I didn’t want to hear anymore and frantically ended the call.

Just like that, Patrick didn’t come home that night.

The next day, even more explosive gossip headlines dominated the news.

""Famous dancer Ivanna Shaw spotted leaving a hotel with a man suspected to be Mr. King.""

The news was sensational, but my heart was frozen.

Patrick, why did you go through all the trouble to be so good to me, only to abandon me like this after we got married?

I wanted to call Patrick and get some answers.

After more than a dozen unanswered calls, Patrick’s secretary called me to say that Patrick’s phone was with him.

Patrick was in a meeting and couldn’t take my calls, so I should stop calling.

It felt like Patrick was deliberately avoiding me, so I decided to go to his office.

But when I arrived at his company, there was no meeting happening in the conference room.

In Patrick’s office, however, there was another woman—Ivanna Shaw.

# Chapter 2 - The Weight of Betrayal

When I pushed open the office door, Ivanna Shaw was perched on Patrick King’s lap, cooing and asking him to throw a celebration party for her. Patrick, noticing the intrusion, immediately grabbed a folder from his desk and hurled it toward the door without even looking up.

""Didn’t I say no one was allowed in? Mitchell Hughes, are you trying to get fired?""

He didn’t even bother to see who had entered, his irritation palpable at being interrupted. The folder struck my leg, and the sharp pain made me wince. Only then did Patrick glance toward the door.

I demanded to know why.

Ivanna, sensing the tension, tried to make herself scarce. In a syrupy voice, she told Patrick she’d be waiting for him in their usual hotel room that evening, adding that she didn’t want to intrude on our conversation. But as she attempted to stand and leave, Patrick’s hand firmly gripped her waist, pulling her back.

""She can hear this,"" he said, his voice icy.

The pressure of his hand made Ivanna let out a soft gasp. Patrick didn’t answer my question, but his hands continued to roam over Ivanna’s body, shameless and deliberate. My face burned with anger and humiliation as I yanked Ivanna away from him.

I stared at Patrick and demanded again, ""Why? Why are you doing this to me?""

He looked at me, his expression cold and detached, and said, ""Now it’s your turn to know what it feels like to be ignored.""

With that, he shoved me aside, wrapped his arm around Ivanna, and strode out of the office.

Patrick’s sudden change in behavior left me stunned. Just two days ago, he had been tender, calling me Roselyn, promising to love and care for me for the rest of my life. He had vowed to help me overcome the shadow of the accident, to stand by me as I healed. But as soon as the wedding ceremony ended, everything seemed to shift.

As I left his office, I overheard some employees whispering. They said that since I could no longer dance, I was worthless. Ivanna, on the other hand, had both beauty and talent. She was the rising star of the dance world, and she had been openly in love with Patrick since she was eighteen, her devotion unwavering.

Patrick had endured my stubborn and difficult personality for three years, and now he had finally seen the light. Falling for Ivanna wasn’t surprising.

But if he loved her so much, why had he married me first, only to openly flaunt his affair with her afterward?

I wandered the streets in a daze, memories of the past three years flooding my mind.

# Chapter 3 - The Accident That Changed Everything

When the car accident occurred, I wasn’t alone in the car—my senior from the dance company, Jesse Mendez, was with me. Jesse was two years ahead of me, and I had just started making a name for myself in the company.

I had saved up a year’s worth of my internship salary to ask Jesse to help me buy a watch. It was from a luxury brand, and Jesse mentioned he knew a sales associate who could get me one without the usual waitlist. In exchange, I had to help him train for a duet for two months—his partner had relapsed with an old injury, and he needed someone to practice with. I agreed.

For the next two months, on top of my own training, I spent an extra two hours every day practicing with Jesse. Two days before Patrick’s birthday, Jesse told me he had arranged with the sales associate, and we could go pick up the watch that day.

But on our way to the mall, the accident happened. Jesse was immediately taken away by his family, while I lay unconscious in the hospital for a full day and night before I woke up.

When I came to, Patrick looked at me with a strange expression and told me I’d never be able to dance again. Hearing that, I lost it, trying to stand up to prove I could. But my legs, encased in casts, wouldn’t budge. Any attempt to move sent sharp, searing pain through them.

From that day on, I became withdrawn, speaking very little. The only thing that gnawed at me was guilt over Jesse. He didn’t have to come with me that day. It was because he was helping me buy a gift for Patrick that he got caught in the accident.

Whenever I brought up Jesse, Patrick’s face would darken. He told me Jesse came from a prominent family in the city and would be fine—he had already been sent abroad for treatment.

Under Patrick’s meticulous care, I was discharged from the hospital. He brought me to his villa, hiring a housekeeper to look after me while he was at work. No matter how busy he was, he always came home to have dinner with me and made sure I had warm coffee in the morning.

He took care of me like this for three years, helping me let go of my obsession and convincing me to marry him, to live a simple, happy life together.

But in the past few days, Patrick’s personality had changed drastically, hitting me like a bolt out of the blue. I was caught completely off guard, unable to make sense of what was happening.

When I returned home, drenched from the rain, I was in a daze. I wanted to go to my room and change my clothes. But when I opened the door, Patrick was there, and my computer was still on.

He had gone through my email history. He knew I was still in touch with Jesse. Jesse’s rehabilitation abroad was going well, and I wanted to ask if there was still a chance for me to return to the stage.

Seeing me nervously checking my email for a reply, Patrick suddenly lunged at me like an enraged lion, pinning me down on the bed. His eyes were bloodshot as he demanded, “Why? I’ve taken care of you for three years. We’re married now, and you’re still thinking about going abroad to find Jesse?”

# Chapter 4 - A Desperate Plea and a Broken Trust

I think Patrick must have lost his mind. I just wanted to ask Jesse about my rehabilitation—what did he mean by going abroad to find him?I tried to break free from his grip, but the harder I struggled, the tighter he held on....

# Chapter 1 - My Life For Yours

I’m going to die.

And nobody gives a damn.

So, I wish myself a life devoid of rebirth after death.

May our paths never cross again.

Caspian materialized, suitcase in tow.

I was a fragile, silent thing, huddled in an oversized coat on the couch.

He shifted slightly, his form a cold, detached outline in the dim light.

Not a single word escaped his lips.

And then he was gone.

I, for my part, didn’t even bother to look up.

The door clicked shut.

My head remained bowed for what felt like forever before I finally raised it.

Staring blankly at the daylight filtering through the window.

It felt like the entire world had given up on me.

Even my husband doesn’t want me around.

He probably thinks I’m beyond saving.

And maybe he’s right.

My trembling hand instinctively went to my stomach.

Just a week ago, there had been a four-month-old baby nestled inside me.

But it quietly slipped away.

I felt utterly and completely alone.

I desperately wanted a child of my own. I’d teach them to read, to sing silly songs.

Teach them to call me Mom.

But that’s never going to happen, is it?

The title of Mrs. Franklin was never truly mine to claim.

This is my punishment for daring to reach for something that was never meant for me.

I slumped back against the couch, feeling utterly defeated.

A weak, humorless laugh escaped my lips.

""I guess I really have nothing left in me.""

I have no idea how long I just sat there, lost in my thoughts.

Eventually, I got up and went to the table, placing the picture frame down with a soft thud.

Someone once said that love is a lifelong journey.

But the truth is, I don’t think I’m capable of love anymore.

I was just about to set the curtains ablaze with the lighter, ready to watch it all burn.

Then the phone started ringing.

I snapped my head towards it.

Hesitated.

But didn’t answer.

It just kept ringing, insistent and demanding.

Finally, I gave in and picked it up.

""Hello?""

""Why did it take you so long to answer?"" It was Annabelle Marshall.

I watched the flickering flame of the lighter dance in front of my eyes.

""Is it urgent?""

""Jolene’s liver is acting up. You need to get to the hospital for a compatibility test.""

I paused, the lighter still in my hand. ""...cough.""

""Are you even listening to me?""

I nodded slowly.

The smoke was getting thicker, stinging my eyes and making me cough uncontrollably.

""I understand.""

""Why are you coughing so much?"" Annabelle asked, her voice laced with suspicion.

""The smoke is too thick; it’s choking me.""

I didn’t say anything else, just tossed the phone aside, grabbed the fire extinguisher, and put out the flames.

Once the fire was completely extinguished.

I tossed the extinguisher aside and collapsed back onto the scorched corner of the sofa.

Gasping for air.

Finally, my hand moved to the area where my liver should be.

The liver?

Alright then.

If I can still help Jolene.

That would be some kind of redemption for me, wouldn’t it?

When I finally arrived at the hospital.

Alfred and Annabelle were already waiting impatiently outside the ward.

Annabelle tapped her foot, her expression tight with disapproval. “What took you so long?”

My gaze was distant and unfocused.

I merely glanced at my parents.

Alfred, ever the peacemaker, gently pulled Annabelle aside.

“Don’t say anything more.”

They reluctantly followed me into the ward.

My eyes scanned the room, landing on the bed.

But the first person I actually \*saw\* was Caspian.

I immediately lowered my gaze.

Ignoring the surprised look on his face.

“I’m heading back to the office,” he announced, standing up abruptly.

He gave a curt nod to my parents.

Even the most composed person can be a little thrown off balance when they see me.

I raised my head slightly, staring out the window.

Of course.

He hadn’t stayed at the hospital when I lost the babies, not once.

I had already told myself I wouldn’t get upset.

But at this moment, my eyes still stung with unshed tears.

But it was fleeting.

The dryness returned quickly.

The figure on the bed lay motionless, pale and seemingly lifeless.

I reached out my hand almost involuntarily.

“What do you think you’re doing?” Annabelle snapped, her voice sharp and accusing.

My hand simply brushed against Jolene’s head, gently smoothing her tangled hair.

After that small gesture, I finally looked at my parents.

“When will the matching process begin?”

Alfred seemed momentarily taken aback by the coldness emanating from me.

At that moment, Derek Morgan, the attending physician, walked into the room.

“Has the candidate arrived?”

But upon seeing me clearly, a flicker of surprise crossed his face.

“You’re not a suitable match.”

I didn’t say a word, just stared straight ahead.

“Lara, are you deaf? Go home.” Annabelle said.

“I can do this, please.”

It was the only plea I could manage.

Then, I turned to leave.

“You?” Derek Morgan scoffed.

“You just miscarried a few days ago, are you trying to kill yourself?”

I paused for a moment at the doorway, my hand on the handle.

“It’s just a test. It won’t kill me.”

Behind me, I heard a long, weary sigh.

The tests were endless.

I ended up staying at the hospital for three days, going through one procedure after another.

In a way, it gave me a chance to physically recover.

After three days.

The tests were finally complete.

I made my way to the fifth floor, where Jolene was staying.

A family of three stood huddled together, blocking my path.

It was Alfred who saw me first.

He waved me over with a hesitant smile.

I nodded and walked into the room.

“Dad, Mom, Jolene.”

“How did it go, have the results come back yet?” Alfred asked.

“Not yet.”

“I’ll head back now.”

My eyes met Jolene's briefly.

As soon as our eyes met, she looked away, avoiding my gaze.

Annabelle glanced at me, her expression unreadable. “Alright, you can go now.”

I nodded and turned to leave.

But just as I reached the doorway.

Alfred called out to me.

“Lara, this pendant looks like something Caspian dropped, could you return it to him?”

I turned my head slowly.

My eyes fixed on the silver locket Alfred was holding out, and I felt a jolt of surprise.

“I found it the day Caspian came to visit.”

Instinctively, my gaze flickered towards the bed, taking in the sight of my sister and mother.

Still, I reached out and took the locket from Alfred's hand.

“Alright.”

As I stepped out into the hallway.

I couldn't help but overhear Annabelle's sharp whisper. “What are you doing? Are you afraid she won’t get to see Caspian?”

Alfred sighed, his voice low. “Their situation doesn’t look good. I fear the two of them might not be able to hold on.”

In the silent hallway, the words hung in the air.

I turned and walked away.

# Chapter 2 - The Liver You Borrowed

Franklin Corporation

I'd already clocked thirty minutes in this sterile waiting room.

Caspian finally wrapped up whatever power meeting he was in and emerged.

He strode into the office, and the moment his eyes landed on me, his brow crinkled in that familiar way.

I finished off the lukewarm coffee and pushed myself to my feet.

Unclasping the pendant from my neck, I held it out to him.

""Here to give this back.""

He flicked a glance at the offered jewelry.

The frown deepened, a hint of annoyance flashing in his eyes as he refused to take it.

Did he think my touch had somehow contaminated it?

I pivoted and placed the pendant on the vast expanse of his desk, offering a curt nod.

Time to leave.

""Wait.""

He made a beeline for his desk.

I aimed for the door.

I hesitated.

""Something else?""

He inclined his head towards the plush sofa. ""Sit down for a minute.""

I stood there, momentarily thrown.

He shrugged off his coat but remained tight-lipped, his hand forming a tight fist.

I broke the silence. ""Going to ask if the transplant compatibility test was a match?""

I was about to tell him the results weren't in yet.

Then my phone buzzed in my pocket.

I pulled it out to check.

Simultaneously, his phone vibrated as well.

It hit me then – he'd been keeping tabs on the hospital's updates.

A dry chuckle escaped my lips.

""If that’s all, I'll head home and try to get myself in top shape for tomorrow’s surgery.""

I reached for the door handle.

""Lara, after the transplant… let's try to make things work, okay?""

My hand froze on the cold metal.

Did he just… what?

Was he actually willing to accept me?

Accept me, the woman he's always referred to as his biggest mistake?

But the truth is, I have no desire to 'make things work' with you.

Caspian, I'm beyond tired.

Completely drained.

I have nothing left to offer.

I didn't dignify his statement with a response.

Instead, I opened the door and walked out.

\---

Back at the condo.

I let the pulled pork simmer on the stove, then aimlessly wandered away from the kitchen.

Bored and restless.

I switched on the TV.

Eventually, I drifted off.

I woke the next morning.

Still sprawled awkwardly on the couch.

The room was bathed in silence.

Only soft sunlight filtered through the gap in the curtains.

This place is far too big.

I should get a cat.

The thought flitted through my mind as I reached for my phone, browsing adoption options online.

But when it came down to choosing one, I hesitated.

A cat?

No, I don't need that.

Owning a pet is a serious commitment, not something to be taken lightly.

\---

One week until the surgery.

I checked into the hospital.

My mom, Annabelle Marshall, actually showed up to see me.

We sat in strained silence for what felt like an eternity, neither of us willing to initiate a conversation.

She wasn’t going to, and frankly, I didn't feel like it either.

""Sorry, but the nicer rooms on the fifth floor were all booked, otherwise your father and I would have gotten you one.""

I simply nodded once.

I turned my gaze towards the window.

""You used to be such a chatterbox when you were little. What happened?""

She sighed heavily and stood up.

""Well, I'll head up to see Jolene first, then I’ll come back to check on you later.""

""Okay.""

She shuffled towards the door.

I stared at the spot where she'd been sitting and the basket of bread rolls she'd awkwardly left behind.

A short laugh escaped me.

The way she nervously stood up, clutched the bread rolls, and then scurried away was almost comical.

Was she embarrassed?

I still can't figure her out.

She could have just gone upstairs, dropped off the bread rolls, and then doubled back.

But she openly dislikes me.

Why would she make a special trip just for me?

\---

Today, I finished the last of my pre-op tests.

Tomorrow is the day.

Clutching the stack of medical reports, I returned to my dreary room.

It was, as always, utterly empty.

I sank onto the edge of the bed, feeling numb.

How could it feel so hollow?

Oh, right.

Caspian did say we should try to make a life together, didn't he?

During my recovery time at home, he never came back.

The week I've been stuck in this hospital, he hasn't bothered to visit once.

Is this his idea of making things work?

Oh.

He specified after the surgery, that’s when we’d start our new life together.

I get it.

He doesn't truly want me.

He just feels obligated and plans to repay that debt with a lifetime of forced companionship.

As long as Jolene is healthy and happy.

He wants nothing else.

\---

Surgery day.

As Jolene and I were about to be wheeled into the operating room, Caspian finally made an appearance.

“Mom, Dad, I’m so scared.”

“It’s okay, sweetie, just think of it as a long nap. The doctor said once it's done, you’ll be as good as new.”

My mom gently tucked a stray strand of hair under Jolene's surgical cap.

Caspian hurried over. ""Is it time?""

""Yes.""

Jolene pulled away from Mom, reaching out towards Caspian.

He instinctively reached out in response.

But Jolene retracted her hand, offering a faint smile.

""Caspian, you're here.""

His hand froze in mid-air.

He stole a fleeting glance in my direction.

Then quickly dropped his hand.

""Yes, it's a very advanced procedure these days, nothing to worry about.""

""Okay.""

Then she flashed another smile. ""You should go say something to Lara. She's been waiting for you.""

Caspian gave a short nod.

He turned to face me.

But his lips seemed sealed shut, and he couldn’t force out a single word.

The surgical team, now fully scrubbed in and gowned, announced, ""Alright, time to head into the OR, family please step back.""

The gurney started rolling.

At that moment, my sister’s fear washed over her again.

She reached out blindly.

Calling out the name closest to her heart.

""Caspian.""

“Don’t be scared.”

There was no time for hand-holding; Caspian simply steadied the bed rail.

My bed rolled forward.

I observed the entire scene play out.

Calmly.

Quietly.

Until the operating room doors slowly swung shut.

Caspian’s motionless figure gradually being blocked from view.

I closed my eyes.

As the surgery was about to commence.

I heard a whispered word of gratitude.

""Thank you, Lara, for agreeing to donate your liver.""

The anesthesia flooded my system.

As I started to lose consciousness.

I barely managed to whisper.

""You're welcome.""

# Chapter 3 - Stolen: My Sister's Keeper

It was like being trapped in a long, disorienting dream.

Nothing felt real, as if a thick curtain blurred my vision.

In the sterile silence of the corridor, I thought I caught a whisper.

""Knowing how your life unfolds, would you still choose this path?""

I strained my neck, trying to locate the speaker.

But the corridor remained empty.

Through the haze, I glimpsed an operating theater.

The surgeons inside were deep in hushed debate.

""Why such an extensive extraction?""

""Wasn't the agreed amount seventy percent?""

""This is excessive. Can the donor even recover from this?""

...

Am I even alive?

Why does my body feel so impossibly light?

I felt myself drifting, untethered.

So much blood on the table, an appalling amount.

And still, I drifted further.

""Sisters, and yet the mother so clearly favors the older one? To allow such a drastic procedure, all to save her.""

""The younger one didn’t object?""

""She simply stared blankly at the documents, then out the window, completely silent.""

""I wanted to offer her some comfort, right then and there.""

I was lost, with no sense of where I was headed.

Four days crawled by.

My eyes fluttered open, slow and heavy.

My body felt pinned, heavy and numb, trapped beneath an invisible weight.

Only my eyes possessed the slightest mobility.

Everything was bathed in white.

""You're awake.""

Ellis Lane, the nurse, was suddenly there.

Her smile was gentle and reassuring.

I managed a slight nod.

""Would you like some water? Let me help you.""

""Thank you..."" My voice was a dry rasp.

She turned, filled a glass, inserted a straw, and brought it to my lips.

The moment I attempted to swallow, a searing pain ripped through my body.

""Easy now, just small sips.""

I managed to take a few.

The nurse took a step back.

""My sister... is she...""

""You mean Jolene, yes? She woke up yesterday and has already been moved out of the ICU.""

That was a small piece of good news.

I gave another small nod.

""Um...""

The nurse hesitated, and I slowly turned my gaze toward her.

She drew a deep breath before continuing.

""Are you... really sisters?""

My eyes flickered downward.

""And that handsome man, is he your husband?... Or your sister’s?""

Her curiosity was palpable, laced with a hint of pity.

I could only imagine what she must have overheard.

With both Jolene and I here these past few days, things must have been said.

I offered no reply.

Closing my eyes, I succumbed to the crushing weight of everything.

# Chapter 4 - Abandoned: Round One

Two days crawled by.Finally, I was sprung from the ICU, though a private room was still unavailable.I arranged for Charli Bryant, a caregiver, to fetch my meds and handle errands.

1lr89yk,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinkingfitness/comments/1lr89yk/2_months_in/,2 months in…,"Hi y’all,

I just needed to get this out because I know this community really gets it.

Quitting drinking has honestly changed my life in so many good ways…I feel clearer…my anxiety is lower…I sleep better…and I don’t wake up drowning in dread anymore. Even though I’m posting today feeling pretty down…I know that’s just part of it. It’s an up and down thing.

I’ll be real…I do get pretty depressed sometimes because I feel less social without drinking. It’s like I’m finding my footing again…figuring out how to connect with people without that old crutch. The support I’ve found here and reading everyone’s stories has helped me so much on the hard days…especially because I don’t really have a lot of people in my real life who understand what quitting feels like.

But I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that part of why I wanted to quit drinking was for physical reasons too. I really wanted to finally lose the last 20 pounds that I’ve never been able to shake…feel prettier…lighter in my body. And right now, two months in…I’m so frustrated because the mental benefits are there…but the physical ones just aren’t showing up yet.

For context…I’ve always been active. I run, surf, do Pilates…you name it. I cut out 100% of alcohol, I was on a GLP-1 before…and I just got back on it a month ago. I’m also diagnosed with PCOS with every symptom you can think of…fibroids, cysts, multiple miscarriages, and never been able to carry a baby to term. I’m having surgery in August to remove endometriosis lining and cysts…so I hope that helps…but for now I feel stuck.

And today I just got so down because it feels like I’ve given up so much and my body won’t budge. For example…today was a “bad” day for me food-wise:
	•	Coffee in the morning.
	•	Didn’t eat until 12 or 1 pm…I’m just not hungry till then.
	•	Had a small personal pizza (about 500 calories)…which felt awful to me.
	•	Felt guilty, so for dinner I had a huge salad…white meat chicken, tons of greens, no dressing.

1lr89ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1lr89ru/2_months_in_no_weight_loss/,2 months in… no weight loss 🤯,"Hi y’all,

I just needed to get this out because I know this community really gets it.

Quitting drinking has honestly changed my life in so many good ways…I feel clearer…my anxiety is lower…I sleep better…and I don’t wake up drowning in dread anymore. Even though I’m posting today feeling pretty down…I know that’s just part of it. It’s an up and down thing.

I’ll be real…I do get pretty depressed sometimes because I feel less social without drinking. It’s like I’m finding my footing again…figuring out how to connect with people without that old crutch. The support I’ve found here and reading everyone’s stories has helped me so much on the hard days…especially because I don’t really have a lot of people in my real life who understand what quitting feels like.

But I’d be lying if I didn’t admit that part of why I wanted to quit drinking was for physical reasons too. I really wanted to finally lose the last 20 pounds that I’ve never been able to shake…feel prettier…lighter in my body. And right now, two months in…I’m so frustrated because the mental benefits are there…but the physical ones just aren’t showing up yet.

For context…I’ve always been active. I run, surf, do Pilates…you name it. I cut out 100% of alcohol, I was on a GLP-1 before…and I just got back on it a month ago. I’m also diagnosed with PCOS with every symptom you can think of…fibroids, cysts, multiple miscarriages, and never been able to carry a baby to term. I’m having surgery in August to remove endometriosis lining and cysts…so I hope that helps…but for now I feel stuck.

And today I just got so down because it feels like I’ve given up so much and my body won’t budge. For example…today was a “bad” day for me food-wise:
	•	Coffee in the morning.
	•	Didn’t eat until 12 or 1 pm…I’m just not hungry till then.
	•	Had a small personal pizza (about 500 calories)…which felt awful to me.
	•	Felt guilty, so for dinner I had a huge salad…white meat chicken, tons of greens, no dressing.
	•	Dessert was Greek yogurt with a tiny bit of whipped cream and some chocolate chips made out of dates.

We're thinking a red, rose, and white wine, plus prosecco, a Portuguese beer we love (Super Bock lol), an IPA, and a non alcoholic beer. There will also be coffee, soft drinks, and non alcoholic punch. I'm not sure if we can include seltzer and cider in our order but I'm going to look into it. 

We can order as much as we think we need and then they will return up to 20% of the total order if we over-ordered. So, we intend to order a generous amount.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **The Great Balloon Debate: Hanshin Tigers vs. Yokohama DeNA BayStars**  
*Where jet balloons meet pitching duels and underdog dreams go to die.*

---

**The Setup**  
The Hanshin Tigers (5-game win streak, 3-2 walk-off heroics) face the Yokohama DeNA BayStars (3-game win streak, 8-5 power surge). Both teams are riding momentum, but the Tigers’ recent clutch gene (thanks to Marwin Gonzalez’s walk-off magic) gives them a slight edge in the ""drama department."" The BayStars, meanwhile, are riding Yuya Kusano’s first win of the season—though his ""first win"" might as well be a rookie’s first cup of coffee.

**Odds Breakdown**

* **Moneyline**:
   * **Hanshin Tigers**: 1.77–1.83 (55.5%–56.5% implied probability)
   * **Yokohama DeNA BayStars**: 1.95–2.05 (48.5%–51.5% implied probability)
* **Spread**: Tigers -1.5 (2.54–2.76 odds); BayStars +1.5 (1.48–1.56 odds)
* **Total**: 5.5 runs (Over: 1.80–1.97; Under: 1.77–1.91)

**Key Numbers**

* **Tigers’ Starter**: Shota Imanaga (1-0, 2 ER in 9 IP, 1.33 ERA). A man who’s already mastered the art of ""just enough.""
* **BayStars’ Starter**: Yuya Kusano (1-0, 1 ER in 9 IP, 1.00 ERA). A rookie with a 1.00 ERA? Sounds like a typo.
* **Recent Trends**: Tigers have scored 3 runs/game in their last 5; BayStars averaged 5.5 in their last 3.

**Injuries & Drama**  
No major injuries reported. The biggest drama? The Tigers’ jet balloons returning in 2026. Will they inflate fan morale or just the stadium’s carbon footprint? Only time will tell.

---

**The EV Calculus**  
Using the underdog win rate (41% for baseball) and implied probabilities:

* **Tigers’ Implied Prob**: \~56%
* **Tigers’ Adjusted EV**: (56% + 59%)/2 = 57.5% → **+3.1% EV** (vs. bookies’ 56%).
* **BayStars’ Implied Prob**: \~50%
* **BayStars’ Adjusted EV**: (50% + 41%)/2 = 45.5% → **-4.5% EV**.

**Spread EV**: Tigers -1.5 at 2.54 (39.4% implied). If their actual win margin > 1.5 runs, this becomes a goldmine.

**Total EV**: Under 5.5 at 1.83 (55.5% implied). With two starters allowing 3 runs total in their last starts? **Under is a no-brainer**.

---

**The Verdict**  
**Best Bet**: **Hanshin Tigers Moneyline** at 1.83 (56.5% implied).

* **Why?** Their EV is +3.1%, and their starter’s sub-2.00 ERA makes them a safer play than the BayStars’ ""rookie magic."" Plus, who doesn’t love a team with a walk-off HR in their back pocket?

**Secondary Play**: **Under 5.5 Runs** at 1.83.

* **Why?** Both starters are pitching like they’ve read the script. The Tigers’ 3-2 game and BayStars’ 1-run allowed in Kusano’s start scream ""low-scoring thriller.""

**Final Thought**: The Tigers are the smarter play, but if you’re feeling spicy, the Under could be your ticket to a slow, methodical snoozer of a game. Either way, the BayStars’ ""first win"" starter is about to learn why they call it a *loss*.

*“The only thing hotter than the Tigers’ streak is the BayStars’ offense… and even that’s debatable.”* 🔥⚾

For me when it’s the work week, I normally only eat a meal in the evening, medium or large portions. Sometimes home cooked but more frequently fast food or frozen. Not usually many if any fruits or veggies. I’ll occasionally eat a granola bar or a sweet treat while at work if I get hungry. 

During my days off, sometimes I eat breakfast, rarely lunch, dinner and usually a sweet treat like ice cream. I would say large portion for dinner, sometimes breakfast. 
Again, not super healthy stuff, more veggies with dinner than normal. 

I pretty consistently drink 1 or 2 cans of soda or energy drinks nearly daily. I used to constantly drink coffee, and a lot of it, but now I’ll normally have a cup or two whenever I eat breakfast. 

I tend to sort of binge and restrict as well too. Sometimes I’ll eat a huge meal, then just not eat anything for a while. And purposely go hungry just because. Sometimes I’m too lazy to find food, sometimes I feel like I’m getting overweight, and sometimes I just don’t give enough fucks about myself or how I feel. 

My doctor told me recently to start watching my cholesterol. I’m 29… my therapist and girlfriend both think I may have an eating disorder or sorts, pretty much everyone agrees I need more unprocessed foods, especially fruits and veggies. Crazy, 10 years ago I was vey into eating healthy. Now I struggle to do it, or even give a fuck.

Nothing debilitating, but not optimal either.

About me:

* 41 y/o male
* BMI is 20, \~10% bodyfat
* Work out every other day with weights
* Eat only whole foods – meat, veggies, fruit, starch mostly around workouts, pastured eggs, avocados, good oils, pea + egg white protein powder, etc. and track my macros/micros in Cronometer. No dairy, grains or gluten (they give me acne).
* Supplement what I don’t get from my diet - vitamin D, mk-4 and mk-7 K2, iodine, ubiquinol, fish oil, homemade eggshell calcium, methylated b-complex (EOD), and magnesium glycinate.
* No drugs/smoking/alcohol
* 1-2 cups black coffee per day, otherwise only water
* Average \~7 hours sleep
* Was diagnosed with a varicocele when I was 18 that I was told by the doctor was just normal veins but now suspect may have something to do with my suboptimal hormone levels.
* Since \~2006 I had been doing 16/8 intermittent fasting, drinking coffee every morning during the fast, and eating lower carb on rest days, but I’ve since started eating breakfast, avoiding coffee until after breakfast, and increased carbs on rest days (carbs already high on workout days) with the (probably flawed) thinking that: chronic high cortisol from fasting and coffee -> low T3 -> elevated SHBG -> low free T.

My GP is referring me to an endo for the elevated SHBG. I’m assuming he’ll want to run more labs, so I want to see if eating breakfast, avoiding coffee while fasted, and more carbs on rest days moves anything in the right direction before making any other changes like supplementing with boron, NAC, myo-inositol, etc.

If anyone could offer any insight on my labs before I meet with the endo I would very much appreciate it. I’d like to avoid TRT (or any pharmaceuticals) if at all possible. And I know this is a TRT sub, but since many here have probably gone through hair loss issues related to it any input on how my labs relate to that would be appreciated as well.

Here he is smelling some candles on cold:

* Vanilla Romance - has new thicker wicks. Essentially the same. Different lid? 
* Vanilla Cafe - not a coffee espresso like Paris Cafe. But more like milky and hazelnut. The most gourmand of his coffee candles/ least perfumey. 
* Vanilla Ease - it is not a dupe of any of his lavender candles, but its own thing. Perhaps a bit of Vanilla Romance vibes plus lavender? It sounds really good. He was impressed. 

He also got Vanilla Cafe hand soap, but wishes he got Vanilla Ease instead (he thinks the dry down of Vanilla Cafe is very common/not impressive). The packaging looks great though. Really handsome looking, like he says. 

And then also some new fall candles

We chatted for an hour or so, she was laughing, smiling etc. I had never seen her laugh ever before, she looked happier since leaving her work. Then that became our thing, we would meet up for coffee once every couple of months and just chat about life etc. She would always be happy to see me, wanted to make plans for us to go play golf etc. We went for walks couple of times.

Biggest things I’m looking for in a city is 
-affordability. 
-safe queer community. I don’t want to just be tolerated, I want to feel embraced
-walkable areas with parks, coffee shops, etc BUT I still want to have my car
-large population of young adults to form friendships and communities with
-no swampy 100 degree heat and no constant rain
-would love access to some form of public transport if possible. traffic being not insane is a priority though
-acting/creative opportunities. 
-some form of nightlife. I don’t need to go to any raves but I want to have some bar options to meet new people
-definitely don’t want NYC or LA as those are a bit too populated for me but like the feel of a bigger city. 

I’ve been looking at Cleveland but don’t know if it’s the right fit. Literally any advice helps. I just feel so overwhelmed with the amount of options and things that need to be taken into consideration. Thank y’all in advance. 

edit: I know this list is asking a lot, but it’s more of a “perfect world” list. i’m very willing to compromise with most of this and love all input!! ",5,1751597375.0,SameGrassButGreener,24,0.69,False

# Order Notes (The Chimes of Big Ben)

By this point in the series, Six is confident. He knows how the Village works. He no longer asks “newbie questions,” and he doesn’t seem shocked by anything he sees. But he hasn’t stopped hoping—he just hopes more strategically now.

His relationship with the Village has shifted significantly over the past few episodes. He led them in *A Change of Mind*, saved them in *It’s Your Funeral* and *Hammer into Anvil*, and now they revere him. He may even be starting to soften toward them in return.

That shift is reflected in the art festival. Six wins with an abstract piece no one understands—because they want to believe in him. Their admiration clouds their judgment. (Whether this is also a metaphor for *The Prisoner*, I leave as an exercise for the reader.)

His protective habits are now well-established, and this is the moment the Powers That Be choose to exploit them. They draw him into *Chimes* by giving him someone new to protect: Nadia.

When she arrives claiming to be a fellow prisoner, he doesn’t entirely trust her—but he wants to. The hope of escape, the hope of human connection, the possibility that she’s genuine—it’s all tempting.

# Order Notes (Many Happy Returns)

I interpret *Many Happy Returns* not as a literal episode, but as a dream—a psychological event taking place during *The Chimes of Big Ben*. Specifically, I place it after Six and Nadia say goodnight in his cottage—around the 14:24 mark on the Blu-ray. The next scene cuts to the beach the following day, making this a natural place for a dream interlude to occur.

That may sound like a cop-out, but I think it ultimately makes the episode more coherent—both emotionally and narratively.

First, there’s the dream logic. In the intelligence office, the analysts chart his course from the Village by drawing lines across Iberia as if it were open water—and no one finds this odd. In a waking world, a room full of professionals wouldn't miss such a glaring impossibility. But in a dream, you don’t notice things like that.

And then there’s the final betrayal. Six returns to London, checks in with his old superiors, and is immediately disappeared again—he had not contacted anyone else. No fiancée, no old friends, no message to anyone he trusts; it’s absurd, especially if *Chimes* has already happened. How could he be so trusting again?

As a dream, the episode’s redundancy becomes a feature, not a flaw. Both *Many Happy Returns* and *Chimes* tell nearly the same story: Six escapes by sea on a handmade vessel, returns to his employer, is betrayed, and wakes up back in the Village. In literal continuity, it's implausible. But in a dream? He’s mentally rehearsing the outcome he fears most. He dreams about escaping this way because he’s already planning to—or the dream plants the seed.

It also adds something important to his character arc. Alone and unobserved, in an empty Village with total freedom, Six doesn’t relax or stay put. He begins a long and dangerous journey back to civilization. That tells us something: he needs people. He needs structure. He still wants to escape, but he doesn’t want to exist outside of community. He’s not a pure rebel. He’s a man who wants society on his own terms.

This change plays out in the episodes that follow:

* He participates in the Village's art festival (*Chimes*).
* He tells stories to the children (*The Girl Who Was Death*).
* He helps Alison with mind reading and photography (*The Schizoid Man*).
* He even attends school (*The General*).

Whether or not *Many Happy Returns* is a literal dream, it reveals a truth: escape isn’t enough. What Six wants—what he needs—is connection and meaning. And the Village is watching, shaping him, drawing him closer through that very insight.

 

# SYNOPSIS (The Chimes of Big Ben)

# Act One

Six wakes to the PA announcing an art competition in six weeks. Watching him from the Green Dome, Two tells Number 23 that he wants to win over Six “with a whole heart, body and soul…. If he will answer one simple question, the rest will follow: Why did he resign?”

Six is playing chess with Number 54. 54 says he’s going to make a chess set for the art competition. When Six says he’s not entering, 54 tells him he’s being a fool and should settle down. Six counters that 54 should try being a little less settled down.

In the Green Dome, Two meets with Six. They watch the arrival of a new Villager: Six’s new next-door neighbor, Number Eight. “What happened to the old Number Eight?” he asks. Dead, Two tells him. No funeral because no body. What Two does not tell him: she killed herself because Six was such a jerk to her.^(1)

The new Eight wakes up in a replica of her home, looks out the window, and sees the Village. Two calls her on the phone and invites her to lunch in the Green Dome.

Two offers Six a deal: “You tell me one thing, and I’ll release you: Why did you resign?” Six turns him down flat. Two tells Six that if he’s going to stay, he might as well take part in community life and enter the art festival.

# Act Two

Six encounters Eight outside their cottages. She asks for directions to the Green Dome and Six happily obliges. When she asks where she is, Six answers simply, “The Village.” She asks him to escort her to the Green Dome and he does.

That night, Six sees Eight returning to her cottage. He invites her into his place for a drink. They talk. She says she’s Estonian, and her name is Nadia. Things get a little heated and she leaves.

That night, Six has a dream.

 

# SYNOPSIS (Many Happy Returns)

# Act One

P wakes in the morning. When he goes to the bathroom, he finds he can get no water from the shower or sink. It’s oddly quiet: no speaker, no PA, not even non-diegetic music.

He goes outside to hear nothing but the wind. The Village appears deserted except for a black cat.

He tries his telephone. It’s dead. This time he doesn’t yell at it.

He searches the Village—no people. He rings the tower bell—no response.

He goes to the Green Dome. The doorbell doesn’t work and the door doesn’t open automatically, but he can open it manually. Two’s office is empty.

In the woods, P chops down trees. He assembles a wooden raft. He goes to the general store for parts—no shopkeeper, so he helps himself and leaves an IOU. He gets a *Tally Ho*, a speaker, and a camera. He takes photos of the Village.

As he prepares to set sail on the raft, he hears a crash. The cat has shattered a cup and saucer. P shoves off.

# Act Two

P is sailing on his raft. Using parts from the speaker he assembles a compass. He begins writing a log on the back of the *Tally Ho*; this is Day 1.

Some time on or after Day 18, he is sleeping when a small boat pulls up beside his raft. The two sailors take everything he has. Believing him unconscious, they throw him into the sea, leaving him face down in the water.

As soon as they’re not looking, he swims to the boat and climbs on at the stern, undetected. They set off, abandoning the raft. (This is a trope that generally annoys me: the hider whose actions demonstrate perfect knowledge or where and when the seekers will be looking even though there’s no way he could have that information. I forgive it here because it’s just a dream.)

While the sailors are upstairs on the bridge, P enters a room downstairs. He discovers a crate full of guns. Judging by the way the guns are stored, this doesn’t look like a very professional operation.

In the kitchen, he starts a fire that emits thick smoke, then extinguishes it. The sailors see the smoke from the bridge. Günther goes downstairs to see what’s burning. P chokes him out. When Green Beanie Guy comes downstairs to investigate Günther’s silence, P chokes him out too. He leaves both sailors tied up in a room and uses a chain to lock the door from the outside. He goes to the bridge and takes the helm. Soon he spots a lighthouse and heads for it.

Downstairs, Günther and GBG—the latter no longer wearing his beanie—have awakened and escaped their bonds. Unable to open the door, they smash the back of a cabinet and it leads into the adjacent room. They return to the bridge and fight P. When Günther retrieves a gun, P jumps overboard and swims away. He’s swimming on the surface, but Günther isn’t a very good shot.

The next morning, P wakes up on a beach. Beachy Head, to be precise. He wanders until he sees a man walking with a dog on a rope leash. When P tries to talk to the man, the man ignores him and keeps walking.

The man goes to a campfire where there are another man and a woman. The woman is the dominant personality. These people are later identified as Romani. (I don’t know what language they’re speaking, but I’m pretty sure it’s not Romani.) The woman gives P some coffee and directions to a road. P thanks her and continues his journey.

At the highway, P sneaks onto the back of a truck, running to catch up to it from behind while the truck is at cruising speed. Impressive guy, P. He takes a nap. You’d be exhausted too after that trick.

# Act Three

P gets off the truck in London. He makes it to his home. Mrs. Butterworth is now living there and has his Lotus. He tells her the engine number of the car to prove his identity as the previous tenant and owner of the car. She is very friendly and invites him in.

He introduces himself as “Uh… Smith... Peter Smith.” He seems to be making the name up on the spot, and it’s generally understood that we never get P’s real name, but what’s the point of using an alias when you’ve already told her who you are? Indeed, he’s surprised to find that his name is not on her paperwork for the apartment or the car.

She tells him it is March 18th. He tells her it’s the day before his birthday. She feeds him and he thanks her.

He tells her details about the house to prove that he is who he says he is (except for the name 🤷‍♂️). She tells him that’s unnecessary, as she already believes him. She gives him some of her late husband’s clothes and lets him borrow the Lotus, and he promises to fix an overheating problem for her.

He returns to his employer and finds Markstein at the desk, doing a crossword.

# Act Four

P is meeting with James, who is a Colonel, and Thorpe, who is played by Patrick Cargill (*Hammer Into Anvil*). Six shows them photographs of the Village and his navigation log on the back of the *Tally Ho*.

Thorpe is skeptical of P’s story. James responds to one of P’s yelling fits with, “You really mustn’t get excited.” Listen to him, P. P tells them he’s going to find out which side runs the Village. James and the Colonel decide to check P’s report. Mrs. Butterworth is interviewed and the remains of the campfire are found.

Later, P meets with James, Thorpe, an unnamed Navy Commander, and a pilot named Ernst. They determine a search area for the Village by tracing P’s route on a map. Nobody seems to notice that the routes they draw would require his raft to sail through France and Spain.

At the airfield, P says he’ll find the Village if it takes “tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow, and tomorrow.”

P is in a plane, searching for the Village. He finds it!

The pilot reveals himself not to be Ernst, who was supposed to be flying the plane. He ejects P, who parachutes safely to the Village.

The Village is still deserted. He enters his cottage, the water and power still off. Suddenly, they come back on.

“Mrs. Butterworth” enters, bearing a birthday cake. She is wearing a Number Two badge. “Many Happy Returns,” she says.

# END SYNOPSIS (Many Happy Returns)

 

# The Chimes of Big Ben (continued)

On the beach the next morning, Six sees Two. Two says that Six is a “lifer” because he’ll never talk. Six points out that Two is also a lifer because he knows too much, and Two agrees. Two tells Six that the Village is “a perfect blueprint for world order.”

Meanwhile, Eight goes for a swim. Two excuses himself and departs. Eight, an Olympic swimmer, keeps swimming out to sea. Two activates Rover. It smothers Eight, then brings her back to shore. Unconscious, like all of Rover’s victims, she’s taken to the hospital.

Two and Six meet at the hospital. Eight is locked up and being interrogated. She gives no answers. The floor in her room is electrified for four seconds out of every eight, as part of some kind of test. She attempts to use the electrified floor to commit suicide, but Two turns the floor off in time to prevent it. He says they’ll have to try something else.

Six demands Two let her go. Two isn’t inclined to let Six give him orders, so Six offers him a deal: “Let her go and… I’ll join in. Try to settle down. I’ll even carve something for your exhibition.” Two accepts the deal.

# Act Three

Six tells Two that he and Eight are going to the woods to carve for the exhibition. He’s going to create abstract art. Two is pleased.

In the woods, Six thinks Eight knows the location of the Village and asks her. He tells her they’re going to escape by boat, but he needs to know where they are. Eight says she’ll think about it and leaves. Six chops down a tree. Two visits and says he’s delighted by Six’s participation.

Six and Eight meet at night. Eight tells Six they’re in Lithuania. Six says that means they’ll head for West Germany or Denmark, 300 miles at least. Eight says they don’t have to go so far because she has a safe place in Poland, just 30 miles away. They say goodnight.

The next day, the two are greeted at the art exhibition by Two. He tells Six that the Awards Committee wants to talk to him about his abstract.

Inside, most of the entries prominently feature Two. 54 has made a chess set and his kings look like Two. He says he’s glad to see Six settling down. The Awards Committee asks Six what his abstract means and Six feeds them a line of complete rot that they call brilliant, a sentiment Two echoes.

At the awards ceremony, the over-60 group is won by Number 38 for her magnificent tapestry of Number Two. Six wins the award for the best entry in any group. He uses his award to buy 38’s tapestry.

That night, Six and Eight assemble a boat from the pieces of Six’s abstract, using the tapestry as a sail, and set out to sea.

# Act Four

P and Nadia reach Poland, where her contact Karel is waiting. How they got a message to him isn’t explained. P gives Karel a coded message to transmit to London.

Karel explains how they will get to London: they get in a crate which will be shipped by sea to Danzig, then by air to Copenhagen, then by air again to London.

P’s watch has stopped because they had to swim the last stretch to shore. He asks for and receives Karel’s watch. They get in the crate and Karel nails it shut. On the way to London, P tells Nadia that “we’ll land in an office that I shall know very well.”

They make it to that office, where the crate is opened and they are greeted by a Colonel and Fotheringay. Everyone else leaves, leaving P alone with the Colonel.

The Colonel is very skeptical of P’s unbelievable story. He suspects that P has defected to the other side and then returned as a mole.

They speak and the conversation turns to P’s resignation.

>**The Colonel:** “Why did you resign?”

>**P:** “It was a matter of conscience.”

>**The Colonel:** “Oh, listen sonny boy, do you think you’re safe in London? If they thought it worth kidnapping you, it’s worth killing you. I doubt if you’ll be alive 24 hours after you leave this building unless you get protection. Do you want it?”

>**P:** “For the girl as well.”

>**The Colonel:** “If you come across with the goodies, yes.”

>**P:** “Political asylum, guaranteed for the girl.”

>**The Colonel:** “Well, that depends.”

>**P:** “It depends nothing, it’s guaranteed.”

>**The Colonel:** “All right, so long as you keep your part of the bargain.”

>**P:** “All right.”

>**The Colonel:** “All right, question one: Why did you resign?”

>**P:** “I resigned because for a very long time… Just a minute.”

P stops when he realizes that Big Ben has just struck eight. His watch says 8:00. But why would he get a watch showing English time from a man in Poland when there’s a one hour difference?

He realizes he’s not in London and leaves. The outer doors open onto the Village.

Two tells Fotheringay that he and the Colonel need to return to London before anyone starts asking questions.

Later, in the Control Room, “Nadia” tells Two it was a good idea, and that he did his best, and she’ll stress that in her report.

# END SYNOPSIS

 

# Wacky Weirdness (in Many Happy Returns)

Some of the things suggesting a dream are:

* They evacuate the whole Village? Six is important, but not the only one who matters.
* It’s absurdly dangerous. He could easily be lost at sea. Some fans argue that the Village is monitoring him at all times and able to protect him from danger, but I find that implausible.
* P doesn’t know that Günther and GBG have a way out when they’re locked up downstairs. If they’re working for the Village, they can just stay there instead of going upstairs to fake a fight. If they’re not working for the Village, P is lucky not to be shot. The Village would take such a risk with him?
* On foot, he catches up to a truck from behind. There is no apparent reason for the truck to be driving along that road at less than human running speed.
* “Peter Smith”?
* James, Thorpe, the Commander, and Ernst now know the approximate location of the Village, and P knows its exact location. The Village would let this info get out? If Ernst is already in on it, why couldn’t he fly the plane?
* P apparently sails his raft through Spain and France, or at least believes he had.
* P would know the approximate latitude of the Village. You can’t fake latitude. If he believes Nadia about Lithuania, the Village has to be at or near Lithuanian latitude. But the dreaming mind can put the Village in Morocco even though the waking mind would realize it doesn’t make sense.
* The secret that P is back in London, and the secret of the Village’s existence and approximate location, can only be kept if P contacts nobody besides Butterworth before returning to his employer and setting out on the airplane.
* Search by plane? You have photos of the mountains around the Village. There are no uncharted mountains on Earth. You know what the mountains look like, find them on a map.
* It’s a common film and TV trope for people from “real life” to show up in different-but-similar roles in dreams. Here, the jerkass authority from the last full episode becomes the jerkass authority in the dream.
* Georgina Cookson, who also appears in a dream in *A. B. and C.*, could be a recurring dream character.
* Come *Do Not Forsake Me, Oh My Darling,* neither Janet nor Sir Charles is aware of P’s previous return to London.

In many episode orders, *Many Happy Returns* is the episode that convinces P to stop trying to escape. I believe the idea goes all the way back to Horn. (His order is consistent with it.) I used that idea in my own order until recently. (Thanks, u/AleatoricConsonance!) Now it has a similar but different role: it’s the episode that convinces P to stop trying to be alone.

The black cat has ultimate freedom. No rules, nobody telling her what to do. She’s not going to get in trouble for breaking that cup and saucer. P leaves that kind of freedom and returns to society, where the first creature he sees is a white dog, tail between his legs, on a leash held by a man heading towards someone who in turn dominates him and herself isn’t exactly queen of the world.

P is given his freedom—the same kind of freedom the cat enjoys. He leaves that freedom to return to the dog’s world of rules and power structures. This affirms an idea that has been germinating in his mind over the past few episodes: he needs people, and he needs community.

 

# Exchanges to Examine (in The Chimes of Big Ben)

**The Deal**

Early in the episode, 54 advises Six to settle down. Six doesn’t seem interested in what he’s saying. The next day, he makes a deal with Two to do exactly that. What changed?

Some say the deal is a ruse—he pretends to be willing to settle down so he can use the art exhibition as cover to build a boat. I disagree.

He’s offering Two a **square deal** and intends to **honour** it (if he doesn’t escape). Something changed overnight. He had the dream and realized that 54 was right. The only deception with Two is pretending it‘s a concession so he can get something in exchange.

**Escape** 

Six’s *Escape* artwork can be seen as a rather brutal commentary on certain approaches to interpreting *The Prisoner*. It’s just parts of a boat, but he tells people that it’s symbolic, and if they’re clever enough they can decipher the symbols and receive the wisdom encoded within. And they eat it up.

This was canned before the series premiered, so it could not have been intended as a comment on *The Prisoner* fandom at the time. However, the approach has become dominant within fandom, and McGoohan did encourage it, so the similarity of this scene to the real world is evident, whether intended or not.

**Russia**

This exchange is pretty awful:

>**P:** Russian?

>**Nadia:** Estonian.

>**P:** Russian.

>**Nadia:** We don’t think so.

Estonia was forcibly occupied and annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940. The Estonian people never accepted this as legitimate, and neither did Britain. Under Soviet rule, Estonians bristled at efforts to erase their national identity and relabel them as “Russians.”

Soviet mouthpieces insisted Estonia was Russian, just as Russia insists Crimea is Russian today. Both claims are based on military force, not consent, and were regarded as laughable and reprehensible by those they were imposed on. So why is P, a British agent, parroting Soviet propaganda that’s condemned by both *his* people and *hers?* Why is he siding with the occupier?

 

# Next: Chapter 9 — The Girl Who Was Death

 

^(1) Speculating here. She was last seen pouting on the beach after Six “borrowed” her precious locket to destroy it for parts and escape without her. If he was as callous to her on his return as he was during the episode, I don’t know how she could have endured it. At least he remembered that there *was* an old Number Eight, so that's something. (The sharp-eyed might notice that Two received Six’s activities prognosis from a Number Eight in *It’s Your Funeral*. There is no indication that Six ever met or knew of that Eight.)",1,1751597096.0,ThePrisoner,0,1.0,False

I tried everything - melatonin, sleep apps, white noise, counting sheep - nothing worked.

Now I fall asleep within 10 minutes every night and wake up actually refreshed. This isn't about sleep hygiene tips you've heard before. It's about understanding how your circadian rhythm actually works and the exact 3-phase system I used to reprogram my sleep from scratch.

(I structured this with clear sections to make it easier to follow. TLDR at the bottom.)

Why Your Sleep is Broken (The Science Part):

Your body has an internal clock called your circadian rhythm that controls when you feel sleepy and alert. This clock is controlled by light exposure, temperature changes, and meal timing.

Here's the problem: Modern life has completely destroyed these natural signals. Bright screens at night confuse your brain into thinking it's daytime. Irregular meal times scramble your internal clock. Room temperature stays constant when it should drop at night.

It's like trying to sleep while someone keeps flashing a strobe light and shaking you awake. Your body literally doesn't know when it's supposed to sleep anymore.

The good news? Your circadian rhythm can be reset in about 2-3 weeks with the right approach. Your brain is designed to sleep well - you just need to give it the right signals.

The 3-Phase Sleep Reset System

Phase 1: Circadian Rhythm Reset (Days 1-10)

Before you can improve sleep quality, you need to reset your internal clock. Most people skip this and wonder why sleep tricks don't work. It's like trying to fix a broken clock by moving the hands instead of fixing the mechanism.

**Morning Light Protocol**: Within 30 minutes of waking, I got 10-15 minutes of direct sunlight in my eyes (no sunglasses). This tells your brain it's officially daytime and starts a 14-16 hour countdown to natural sleepiness.

On cloudy days, I used a 10,000 lux light therapy lamp for 20 minutes while having coffee. The key is consistency - same time every morning, no matter how tired you are.

**The 3-2-1 Rule**: 3 hours before bed, no more food. 2 hours before bed, no more work or stressful activities. 1 hour before bed, no more screens.

This gives your body time to process food, wind down mentally, and reduce blue light exposure that blocks melatonin production.

**Temperature Manipulation**: I dropped my room temperature to 65-68°F and took a hot shower 90 minutes before bed. The rapid temperature drop after the shower mimics your body's natural sleep signal.

By day 7, I was falling asleep 20 minutes faster than before.

Phase 2: Sleep Optimization (Days 11-20)

Now we focus on improving the actual quality of your sleep cycles. You can fall asleep quickly but still wake up tired if your sleep stages are messed up.

I stopped all caffeine after 2 PM. Caffeine has a 6-hour half-life, meaning if you have coffee at 4 PM, half of it is still in your system at 10 PM blocking adenosine (the sleepy chemical).

I eliminated alcohol completely for these 10 days. Alcohol might make you drowsy, but it destroys your REM sleep and deep sleep stages. You fall asleep but don't get quality rest.

Blackout curtains, eye mask, earplugs, and a white noise machine. Your bedroom should be a sensory isolation chamber. Even small amounts of light or noise can fragment your sleep without you realizing it.

If I was exhausted, I'd take a 20-minute power nap before 3 PM. Longer naps or late naps steal sleep pressure from nighttime.

By day 15, I was sleeping through the night consistently and waking up less groggy.

Phase 3: Sleep Debt Recovery & Maintenance (Days 21-30)

The final phase is about paying back your sleep debt and creating a sustainable system for long-term quality sleep.

For every hour of sleep you're short, you accumulate sleep debt. If you need 8 hours but get 6, that's 2 hours of debt that compounds daily.

I calculated I had about 50+ hours of sleep debt built up. You can't pay this back in one weekend - it takes weeks of consistent quality sleep.

Same bedtime and wake time every single day, including weekends. Your circadian rhythm doesn't understand ""weekends"" - irregular sleep times confuse your internal clock.

I gradually moved my bedtime earlier by 15 minutes every 3 days until I was getting my optimal 7.5-8 hours. Sudden changes don't stick.

Created a 30-minute morning routine (sunlight, water, light movement) that signaled to my body that sleep time was officially over.

Around day 25, something clicked. I started waking up naturally 5 minutes before my alarm, feeling actually refreshed instead of like I'd been hit by a truck.

What Actually Works vs. What's Popular:

Most sleep advice is garbage because it treats symptoms instead of root causes. Sleep apps don't work if your circadian rhythm is broken. Melatonin doesn't work if you're getting light exposure at the wrong times.

What works is systematically resetting your internal clock, optimizing your sleep environment, and gradually paying back sleep debt while maintaining consistency.

Melatonin can be useful during Phase 1 to help reset your rhythm, but it's not a long-term solution. Use 0.5-1mg (not the 5-10mg most people take) about 2 hours before desired bedtime.

Common Mistakes That Ruin Progress

**Weekend Sleep-ins**: Sleeping until noon on Saturday destroys a week of progress. Your circadian rhythm needs consistency more than extra sleep.

**All-or-Nothing Thinking**: One bad night doesn't mean you've failed. Sleep improvement is a trend, not perfect every single night.

**Ignoring Light Exposure**: You can do everything else right, but if you're staring at bright screens until bedtime, you'll still struggle.

**Trying to ""Catch Up"" with Long Naps**: This steals sleep pressure from nighttime and perpetuates the cycle.

The Results After 30 Days

I now fall asleep within 10 minutes every night. I wake up naturally feeling refreshed instead of hitting snooze 5 times. My energy levels are stable throughout the day without caffeine crashes.

More importantly, I understand how my sleep system works and can adjust when life throws curveballs (travel, stress, schedule changes).

Good sleep isn't about perfect conditions - it's about working with your biology instead of against it.

TLDR:

* **The Problem is Biological, Not Behavioral**: Your circadian rhythm (internal clock) controls sleep timing through light exposure, temperature changes, and meal timing. Modern life has destroyed these natural signals with bright screens at night, irregular schedules, and constant room temperatures. The solution isn't sleep hygiene tips but systematically resetting your internal clock by giving your brain the right biological signals. Most sleep problems are circadian rhythm disorders, not insomnia, which is why traditional sleep advice often fails.
* **Phase 1: Reset Your Internal Clock (Days 1-10)**: Get 10-15 minutes of morning sunlight within 30 minutes of waking to start your natural sleepiness countdown. Follow the 3-2-1 rule: no food 3 hours before bed, no work 2 hours before bed, no screens 1 hour before bed. Drop room temperature to 65-68°F and take a hot shower 90 minutes before bed to mimic your body's natural temperature drop. These signals tell your brain when it's actually time to sleep. By day 7, most people fall asleep 20 minutes faster through circadian reset alone.
* **Phase 2: Optimize Sleep Quality (Days 11-20)**: Cut all caffeine after 2 PM since it has a 6-hour half-life that blocks adenosine (sleepy chemical). Eliminate alcohol completely as it destroys REM and deep sleep stages even though it makes you drowsy initially. Create a sensory isolation chamber bedroom with blackout curtains, eye mask, earplugs, and white noise. Limit naps to 20 minutes before 3 PM to preserve nighttime sleep pressure. By day 15, you should sleep through the night consistently with less morning grogginess.
* **Phase 3: Pay Back Sleep Debt & Lock in Consistency (Days 21-30)**: Calculate your accumulated sleep debt (every hour short compounds daily) and gradually extend bedtime by 15 minutes every 3 days until reaching optimal 7.5-8 hours. Maintain identical bedtime and wake time every day including weekends since your circadian rhythm doesn't understand weekends. Create a consistent 30-minute morning routine to signal sleep time is officially over. Around day 25, most people start waking naturally before their alarm feeling genuinely refreshed.
* **Long-term Success Principles**: Sleep improvement is about working with your biology, not against it through willpower or perfect conditions. Common mistakes include weekend sleep-ins that destroy weekly progress, all-or-nothing thinking after one bad night, ignoring light exposure timing, and trying to catch up with long naps that steal nighttime sleep pressure. Melatonin can help during the reset phase (use 0.5-1mg, not 5-10mg) but isn't a long-term solution. Good sleep is a biological system that can be optimized through consistent signals, not a personality trait you're born with or without.

Previously, I was into third wave coffee. I would buy speciality beans, measure them each morning (18 gms), use my 1zpresso hand grinder and pull an expresso shot using my Flair 58+. The coffee I got out of it was amazing and even the local cafe's wasn't close. My flat whites were heaven and everyone at home loved it. But the whole workflow in the morning was time consuming, right from start to clean up was 20-30 minutes depending on how much sleep I had the night before (I have a 15 month old).

I am very time poor, and I would like to save this 20 minutes in the morning too now. So I decided to try the Vertuo Pop. I got myself the Double expresso scuro. I have tried the regular mode and expert mode, but I find the taste to be metallic and it does not have that kick I am used to. I usually make an expresso and then do a long black. I am happy to try other pods, other recipes. Can anyone give some advice on how to get a good coffee out of these Vertuo pop machines?

In my first few years of working - I found myself in a prestigious firm that exclusively hired from Oxbridge (some of my former bosses were also loosely related to the royal family). Despite having several successes at my old place of work - I struggled with everything else social or required EQ (?) (I'm not even too sure how to sum up what I struggled with - essentially I was never invited to client meetings, I heard one of the partners outrightly say that I'm not suited to be brought along to a networking event, another was shocked when I said I graduated from Oxford because I didnt seem like someone who fit the profile, I make jokes that fall flat (I dont even realise that I do it until I see the horrified looks on everyone else's face), I always struggled to answer questions with tact in meetings (just rumbling through information which makes me look like a complete air head). It's not that I don't know my stuff - I do. But to put it short, I have vocal fry + self depreciating humour that falls flat + I speak like I'm an air head 16 year old + sound like I'm annoying to work with. That had set me back in my career tremendously.

I've been job hunting for a while now having made redundant from my last place of work due to a restructuring. I'm getting through the first rounds of CV screening and have many people interested in speaking with me. But as soon as I get that coffee, that introductory call, or that interview - I get ghosted, or I watch how interviewers scoff, roll their eyes or worse just outright giggle at what I have to say. More recently, I was turned down for a job at a massive company despite them saying in the 3 month long interview process that I fit the bill. In another job interview a couple of months ago - they said I come across as immature for the role. This is in spite me rehearsing days on end for interviews.

I'm not too sure who to approach at this point - a speaking coach, a career coach. I just need to fix the way I speak and carry myself. If anyone has any advice, have been through something similar or know someone who can help me fix this, I'd be very grateful.

Thank you.

EDIT: To add, I also have a major case of being too casual and having mouth diarrhoea. Case examples:

1. An interviewer asked what I would do if I found one of my direct reports seemed unmotivated and uninterested in the work. I responded with a 'joke' saying well we can't help them all can we followed by a minute or two about how we can't convince someone to do work that they dont want to. Only for me to snap back to reality and explain how I would encourage them, set strategic meetings etc etc. By then, it was too late.  
2. In a separate interview a few months before the one above, an interviewer asked why I left my first job listed on my CV and I shrugged and said that the work was too dull and I was bored most days followed by how everyone around me was just lazy and I found myself planning vacations and booking flights on company time. Again, only for me to snap back to reality explaining how I wanted ""more out of my job"" and how I wanted to be intellectually stimulated etc.

I started getting migraines after I got flung into a tree head first due to rock giving way under a 4 wheeler in Mexico. Probably not my smartest choice but I did not go to the hospital at the time. Next day I started getting a headache but got better after my daily coffee so I just kept drinking more caffeine. I was young enough at the time I was still with my parents so I told my mom and dad but they wrote it off as me being dramatic. So I kept drinking more and more caffeine. Then I went on vacation and thought it'd be a good idea to try and reduce my caffeine intake. That caused me to get the full effect of migraines. I couldn't go outside I couldn't be in the light I was vomiting daily. Eventually I caved and drank coffee and ate coffee beans. My parents felt terrible for not having believed me when I originally told them. My chiro did new x-rays and found out I compaction So then we cut all caffeine out and started the journey. Spent about six months going to urgent cares to cure it because my mom wanted to find a neurologist in network. After about three months with that Neuro and it not working out my mom's paralegal who has been with her firm since literally a month before I was born and has had migraines for about 40 years said she was taking me to her Neuro so I can get to his NP. She is a godsend. She looked at the history of everything I tried, every medication for other ailments I've had and my side effects with those, she she built a binder. We started with ajovy and it worked perfect except I'm horrible about needles so we switched me to qulipta. With the binder it was approved instantly. But even though migraines are gone I still get the neck pain if I don't go to my chiro regularly. And that pain causes nausea and vomiting. I don't know what to do about that part tho. My chiro is who figured out I have a compaction in my neck because like I said I made the mistake of not going to the hospital. I also am aware there's a fancy science term (cervical myelopathy) for the neck compaction but I feel like saying compaction gets the point across easier. Accupressure helps the nausea but I can't hold my little tools in the base of my skull forever or while I'm at work. The migraine part being gone took away the light sensitivity, pressure behind eyes, odor sensitivity, chills, the random phantom pains from brushing against the couch, and of course the head pain but I'm still fighting the nausea. I never got aura, had sound sensitivity, was dizzy or had distorted vision.

Good is that it’s done!  And seems Ok though they took a few biopsies here and there.  The bad was all the prep, did the low residue diet, then the liquid the day before.  Low residue always makes me bloat up and feel uncomfortable.  As an aside I am gluten free and mostly dairy free.  I eat 20-30 different plants per week, my gut has seemed to be in good shape since started all this a few years ago.  I had to do the low Fodmap protocol per my gastroenterologist a few years ago and that helped, found my triggers and avoid those.  Unfortunately on the low residue didn’t check my bread and crackers (GF) and all were brown rice whole grain based so those were out.  So lots of blah stuff that made me bloated and constipated, which of course is the idea.  Then started liquid diet which was even more.  Hate that on liquid diet I was pretty much limited to salty or sweet.  But got through it.  Not fun.
Now the ugly, the Suprep.  First time I have had that.  My appointment was at 8:20, had to be there at 7:20, about 25 minute drive.  Next time I would make my appointment later because what this meant was I had to do dose 2 at 3:20 am.  That stunk.  Anyway what I did with the Suprep was (after reading ideas on this sub) get a range of chasers to see which worked for me.  Apple juice (normally a no-no for me as it is very high Fodmap), Pedialyte non-red berry, coffee, non pulp lemonade, white grape juice.  Don’t do sodas, give me heartburn so didn’t try ginger ale or Sprite.  Lined them all up on the counter.  Started with a couple of sips (straw didn’t help,  enter for me to drink it diluted straight), then followed immediately by one of the various chasers.  Tried all of them and found by far for me the best one was the white grape juice, something about that flavor cut the nastiness of the salty yucky Suprep.  Once I figured out what chaser was going to work I stuck with that.  So kept going and got dose 1 down in about 20-25 minutes.  Then after the last chaser of white grape juice had to start on the Pedialyte and Gatorade and water.  Getting that 32 ounces down in one hour not a walk in the park but I found what helped me was to walk around between sips.  Sip, walk, sip, walk.  Took about 45 minutes to get going,but then for me it lasted and lasted.  I went to bed around 8:30 since I had to be up by 3:30 but was woken up at midnight for another go.  The got back up at 3:30 to do dose 2.  I could NOT get the whole thing down so I did half of it with my chaser.  Good news is it went faster and I was going clear soon after.  Showered at 6, made it at 7:20. 
Got in late, they were backed up so didn’t get in until about 9:00 but was out by 10. 
I am not good at any type of anesthesia or meds like that and was pretty loopy after.  I was babbling stupid stuff like asking the excellent nurse who helped me before and after if I could tip her, LOL.  Then told another one I was dreaming before I woke up that we were all at a party together and wouldn’t that be fun.  I’m sure they’ve heard it all.  
So next time even though it means longer until finishing and thus more hunger and dehydration I would make the appointment slightly later so didn’t have to get up at 3:30 a.m. for dose 2.  Might have done like 10 a.m.  
so that’s my story, good luck to all of you going through this.  Once you’re done it’s like YAY I don’t have to do this again for (in my case) 5 years.  So try to get through and not cancel, the joy of being DONE is worth it!",1,1751596488.0,colonoscopy,1,1.0,False

Music holds a special place in my heart. At the moment, I'm curating a dinner playlist, and it's turning out fantastic; it features artists like Kacey Musgraves and Ella Fitzgerald. In fact, I have a playlist that spans 20 hours and includes a diverse range of genres.

Theater, ballet, and opera . I adore dressing up to witness exceptionally talented performances—it’s always a magical experience.

When it comes to food, I enjoy dining out and experiencing new restaurants. While I can cook and do enjoy it, I’m currently in a phase where exploring brunch and dinner spots with friends is my preference. I’m a big fan of iced coffee and enjoy sharing too much champagne with good company!

I was recently  engaged, but I decided to end that relationship. While I feel at peace with my choice, I'm seeking genuine friends to help navigate the craziness of the world right now. Things in America have become truly overwhelming, and it is  both heartbreaking and frightening.

1lr7mlj,https://www.reddit.com/r/alcoholicsanonymous/comments/1lr7mlj/is_this_a_relapse/,Is this a relapse?,"I was about 3 months sober from alcohol and had gotten super into AA--going to meetings 3-5 times a week, getting a sponsor, having coffee with tons of people I'd met through the program. I probably have about 30+ numbers from people I've met across 10 different meetings.

I'd also stopped smoking weed around the same time I stopped drinking, mostly because of a change in my living situation. I picked it back up around a month ago because I'd gotten bored of all the productive ways I'd been coping with life stressors and missed the occasional escape of being high. It wasn't long before I was smoking/taking edibles 3-4 times a week, down from my previous habit from a couple years ago of using daily, but definitely more than I'd been intending to use. 

I told my sponsor, who said she considered it a relapse and wanted me to start counting days again. I just hit 4 months a few days ago and was really proud of the progress I'd made and the connections I'd found in the program. I really didn't want to start counting days again, but she said she wouldn't be able to sponsor me anymore if I continued my day count. I talked to a few friends in the program and 90% of them said they agreed with my sponsor. 

I know there is a lot of controversy within AA re: smoking weed while remaining alcohol-free and how ""Cali sober"" isn't real sobriety. But if alcohol was always my main issue and the thing with the most potential to genuinely fuck my life up beyond recognition, is a little weed here and there really a relapse as long as I'm not using the way I used to drink?

Realistic advice is also appreciated.

So I have this very very close friend at work. He's straight, with fiance and a kid. And a top leader in our company, in a global level (we are a huge congolomerate). Im his junior and an openly bi guy. We were very tight.

Anyway he went on a worktrip abroad and asked me to follow so it was a vacay for me. He wanted me to try cannabis (it's legal where we were). It was my first time but he had this many times before

We got high. We were talking. He led the convo to something sexual. I didnt mind because we were open. Also even before, he was very jokingly touchy but I brushed it off as straight guy roughing our humor, thiugh I tell him to stop. But to be very clear, I have never shown any indication of attraction because I know how the optics look when it is the queer guy giving compliments. And I dont feel that way.

So anyway the stuff he was saying included apologizing to me for his touching and all. I was saying yeah yeah no worries. Then he was asking me to lay beside him. I said no many times. This went on for like 4 times, until I finally said ""just lie in my bed"" thinking he would stop and maybe he would just protect me from doing anything stupid because I was really high.

Then when he did. He cuddled me. He asked me to cuddle but said 'no' many times or pretended I didnt hear him. But when he changed his tone, I did it because Im now worried how saying no or rejecting him will affect our relationship and my career. I wasnt afraid he'd physically hurt me tho even though he was this big buff guy and Im so much slimmer.

Im not gonna go on more details but he made me do sex stuff. He was the one in charge, telling me what to do and he seems more sober than me because he had the foresight on what will happen (like he told me where to do it so his fiance wont see). In between, he was saying ""should we be doing this"" or ""hey we're still cool right"" and I was placating him like ""yeah sure"" but honestly I just wanted it to be over. When he was done he showered and said ""how are we gonna be tomorrow?"" then left me on my bed. 

Come morning we were very alloof and awkward and we spent the next four days avoiding each other, though talking a bit. We got to spend time a little on our last day, but obviously still distanced. On our lunch he was joking again and flexing his muscles and all so I thought this is my chance to ask, but he got high again. We sidnt talk much until our flight back. This was tough for me fearing that things changed but I was giving him time since it must be confusing for him and he must be ashamed.

On Monday, he went to the office and sat on his desk (next to mine) but I transferred seats because he made me anxious. He joined me and our friends in the pantry so I left because it causes me anxiety to see him be present but not talk to me. Then I felt guilty for building that wall so I asked him for coffee and he said no.

The next few days he transferred to another site so we didnt see each other. On Friday I caught him in the elevator but didnt have the courage to ask to talk. So I messaged him on messenger but he just told me ""Nothing to talk about. Give me time. But keep quiet."" It triggered me so much. Like how he dismissed me and thought only of himself when he involved me in this mess. I was so hurt so I sent a long message saying I just wanna get a the reassurance that we are still friends and also I have so many questions. And how his ignoring made feel used that I literally stopped eating.

That was my last message and Im just waiting him to talk to me because Im spiraling down from the pain and confusion and guilt and paranoia and anger. At first I just wanna fix the friendship and clear the air and make sure our work wont be affected and that he wont do it again since he has a fiance. 

Sometimes I blame myself. Like should I have talked to hin right away? Should I gave him more time before asking to talk? Should I just pretended to be asleep or walked out (though I couldnt stand because I was high).

But now, since I lost trust on him, Im reflecting if I should report it to HR. But he's an influential global leader so Im considering lawyering up because with the power dynamic and all some say it is assault. But tbh I dont wanna go through this. This is so unimaginably stressful for me. I have seen 3 therapists almost everyday. I dont want to drag this. The last two weeks were emotional hell, I cant imagine doing this more. And I wanna believe still that this guy is still the good guy I lookes up to and probably just made a lapse in judgement.

All I want is for him to acknowledge what happened so I know he is still that person that I knew. He had been so kind to me and I am still shocked how this went. But right now I dont know who he is and what he is thinking so Im torned between giving hin the benefit of the doubt and moving on while being open if he reaches out to me, OR just report this and be ready for a long draining battle and accept the bridge has burned.

Right now, I just want to cope with the pain and function like normal again so I can lead my projects properly. Tbh the sexual stuff, I can forgive that and look past that, if he would just give me a sincere apology and explanation and a promise me Im safe despite knowing his secret.",5,1751595863.0,ainbow,2,1.0,False

Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park — A Prestige Survival Horror Series

Title: Michael Crichton’s Jurassic Park
Format: 10-episode limited series, 55–75 minutes each
Tone: True to the novel. Survival horror. Practical effects. No hero raptors — just nature unleashed. Alien meets Chernobyl on Isla Nublar.

⸻

📚 Core Concept

A grounded, faithful adaptation of Michael Crichton’s original Jurassic Park. No blockbuster gloss — just the raw, terrifying version Crichton wrote: corporate greed, chaos theory, genetic hubris, and humans totally out of their depth. The iconic scenes that never made it — the river raft, aviary, maintenance shed, burrows — all finally done right.

⸻

🦖 Starring:
	
•	Pedro Pascal — Dr. Alan Grant
Rugged, practical, reluctant protector. A field paleontologist who becomes a survival guide for two terrified kids.
	
•	Emily Blunt — Dr. Ellie Sattler
Brilliant paleobotanist. Grounded, steady, no-nonsense. The moral compass when the park falls apart.
	
•	Adam Driver — Dr. Ian Malcolm
Towering, dry-witted chaos theorist. The one voice of truth in Hammond’s fantasy.
	
•	Gary Oldman — John Hammond
Not a kindly grandpa — a driven visionary, older but still vigorous, obsessed with legacy. A man who sacrificed everything for this idea.
	
•	Jesse Plemons — Dennis Nedry
Greasy, petty systems genius. Glasses, snacks, bribes — and the spark that burns the whole thing down.
	
•	Idris Elba — Robert Muldoon
Ex-game warden. The only one who understands the raptors are more than animals — they’re monsters. Calm, precise, lethal.
	
•	Walton Goggins — Ray Arnold
Chain-smoking, exhausted engineer. The backbone holding the park together with duct tape and coffee — until he steps into the dark.
	
•	Tim & Lex Murphy — Unknowns
True to the book: Tim is older, the dino-obsessed hacker; Lex is younger, impulsive, sports-loving, stubbornly human. Real kids, real fear.
	•	Samuel L. Jackson — Cameo
One wink for legacy fans — not Arnold, but a perfect moment somewhere in the chaos.

⸻

🎬 Why It Works
	•	Finally does the novel justice.
	•	Unapologetically dark.
	•	Fully practical creature effects where possible.
	•	Real jungle. Real rain. Real dread.
	•	No cheesy action heroes — just flawed people trying to survive the unstoppable.

1lr7776,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lr7776,Type me based on this template!,"Im curious to see what people think I am! So, here is a picture collage and some info about me, if you are interested in trying to guess my mbti. If you do take the time to do so, thank you! <3

A basic description of myself would be that I love to draw, read, make bracelets, paint… you name it! I am hypersensitive and think based on my emotions most of the time, but not in an irrational sense. I love routines and change scares me lots! I perform better in small groups/one-on-one conversations. 

I am highly observant of my surroundings (which also is why I remember/notice very small details, and remember them very easily) Everyone is like this to some extent— obviously. But I’ve been told on several accounts that I remember lots and lots of somewhat meaningless things. I believe it’s because I link an emotional factor to everything so my brain chooses to remember it. 

I sympathize with others with ease, It’s as like I can feel exactly how their pain is. 

I often prefer being alone, as much as socializing is fun, it’s hard to keep up and entertain. 

Identifying my feelings is incredibly easy, I always know what’s wrong & why. 


So as for how I’m perceived goes: 

I can say people view me as a soft spoken person.
They are also very surprised if I ever curse, mostly those who aren’t my very close friends. I can seem intimidating, mostly because I don’t talk and don’t give eye contact, but observe. I am seen as shy by my relatives. However, they see that I am chatty and optimistic on one-on-one conversations with a few selected individuals. (Something everyone does, I know c’:  ) I’ve been described as affectionate , because despite my shyness, I love to give out hugs to everyone. 

*I don’t want to give away too much, as you have to mainly guess by vibes haha!* 

To summarize my picture collage:
- I feel like a vibrant cozy coffee shop would describe me best! 

- I loveeee painting! (Most of this slide show uses pictures from Pinterest, except that one which is my recent paintings) 

- The softness and gentleness of summer 

- Dutch braids are  somewhat « child-like » which is how I feel in group settings 

- I dress with soft colors and a gentle/classy essence

My boyfriend Randy and his friends kept a group chat specifically to turn me into a replica of his first love.

""Today’s hairstyle isn’t right. Without that slight curl, she doesn’t look like Audrey.""

""And today’s outfit—Audrey would never wear such a tacky shirt."" My eyes flickered for a moment.

Audrey Evans was my boyfriend's beloved crush.

Then came the day Audrey returned to the United States.

I secretly changed into a mini skirt, painted my eyes smoky, and spent the night with an attractive stranger I met at a nightclub.

After three years of trying to be the obedient girlfriend, I was beyond sick of it.

\*\*\*

I arrived outside the bar just in time to hear someone laughing out loud inside.

""It must have felt like a huge accomplishment to transform your girlfriend into your dream girl, right? I bet you're having a lot of fun in bed!""

Upon hearing this, I froze immediately.

Through the crack in the door, I saw Randy, who was supposed to be dead drunk, sitting in the middle of his friends. Smoke curled in the air around him, blurring his expression.

""It's alright. No matter how good a copy is, it'll never beat the original, right?"" He smirked and joined in the laughs.

That smile landed cold and harsh in my heart beneath the dark lights.

It felt like I'd plunged into an icy lake as every drop of blood in my body seemed to freeze solid.

I didn't know how long I stood there.

Only when their conversation shifted that I finally pushed open the door.

""Randy.""

Everybody looked up and exchanged looks before clearing a path for me.

""Debra, you're here. Randy's had a bit too much. Sorry to trouble you.""

Their words were polite, but the mockery in their eyes was unmistakable.

I wondered how I had never noticed it before.

When Randy spotted me, his eyes lit up, and he opened his arms wide. ""Honey, come give me a hug.""

There was so much warmth in his eyes that it made me doubt what I'd just heard.

I struggled to get him back to bed, helped him change his clothes, and made a cup of coffee for his hangover.

""Randy,"" I whispered. ""Get up and drink this, or you'll wake up with a terrible headache.""

He opened his eyes slowly and wrapped his long arms around my waist, resting his chin on my shoulder and nuzzling affectionately.

""Feed me,"" he mumbled.

His hot breath tickled my ear.

I placed the cup near his lips, ready to feed him. But before I could do so, he grasped my chin and pulled me into a deep, lingering kiss.

His breath reeked of alcohol, but his mouth only tasted faintly of tobacco.

I felt a pang of resistance and was just about to pull away when he let go on his own.

""Honey, I don't want to drink that coffee. I promise I will not have a headache tomorrow. I'm just so exhausted. Let me sleep, okay?""

A phone buzzed in the middle of the night, waking me alert. I groggily reached for it on the nightstand and unlocked it.

""I was sleeping when I remembered that we haven't rated Debra's looks today! Wake up, guys! Let's give her a score.""

""Honestly, I'd give her a 6 out of 10. Her hair is wrong as it doesn't have that little wave, so she doesn't look like Audrey.""

""And what's with the shirt she was wearing? It's so tacky. Audrey would never wear something like that.""

Only then did I realize that I had grabbed the wrong phone. Randy and I shared the same lock-screen password.

Scrolling up, all I noticed were their judgments against me.

Randy would occasionally chime in, saying, ""I got it. I'll ask her to try a different haircut tomorrow.""

Suddenly, all of his odd requests made sense.

""Honey, how about I go to the salon with you tomorrow?""

I hesitated as I stroked my long hair, which had grown for two years. ""I don't want to cut it.""

But he kept pestering me. If I didn't say yes, he wouldn't stop.

Finally, I gave in with tears pooling in the corners of my eyes and cheeks flushed.

When I saw him seriously discussing with the hairstylist about what cut would suit me, I thought it was a sweet gesture.

Little did I know, all he wanted was for me to look more like her.

I was a stand-in for three years, and I knew nothing about it.

In the dark, the brightness from the phone screen lit up my pale face like a ghost.

Chapter 2

The next morning, I resumed my role as the perfect girlfriend, fixing his tie and sending him off with a grin.

Randy gently patted my head and placed a soft kiss on my lips. His mouth curled into a playful grin. ""A goodbye kiss for you. Wait for me to come home.""

I nodded obediently.

I watched his car drive away down the street through the window. Then I turned away, wiped off my subtle natural makeup look, and replaced it with a sultry smoky eye.

In the mirror, I saw a woman with sharp, seductive eyes and a wicked little smirk.

This was the real me.

I strolled into the backroom of Twilight Bar with familiarity.

""The manager's eyes brightened up as soon as he noticed me.

""Debra! You've finally arrived. Quickly get on stage. You've been gone so long, and the crowd has been waiting just for you!""

I nodded and walked to the stage, meeting the crowd's wild, expectant eyes as I took my place behind the drum kit.

""Debby! Debby!""

""I come here every night hoping to see you! I love you, Debby!""

""Debby, you're so hot!""

The moment I gripped the drumsticks, my whole demeanor changed.

I immersed myself in the rhythm, and each movement I take are confident and magnetic. The beat reverberated throughout the bar, electrifying the crowd.

The shouting continued, and I was completely lost in the music.

After powering through five songs without pause, I stepped offstage under reluctant stares.

As I bowed, I noticed a familiar person on the second-floor balcony.

He was looking directly at me.

It was Randy.

I quickly lowered my head in panic.

He averted his gaze as if nothing had happened, lazily fiddling with the glass in his hand, obviously bored.

I was stunned that he couldn't identify me after three years of sleeping in the same bed.

A quiet ache spread through my chest, hollowing me out, and my whole body screamed with pain.

""Debra?"" The manager's voice snapped me out of it.

""Yeah?"" I turned to him.

""You saw how it was tonight,"" he said. ""Your fans were going crazy waiting for you. I was just wondering if you could maybe come in a few more times a week. I can...""

""Sure,"" I cut him off and thought for a second before continuing, ""I can come four times a week. You can figure out the schedule.""

""Perfect! Great!"" He practically skipped away to make arrangements.

As I was heading out, my phone buzzed.

It was a message from Randy. ""Honey, I saw someone today who looked just like you. But she's not as pretty as you. I miss you so much.""

My heart trembled. I was ready to respond when I heard voices behind me.

""Randy, I heard Audrey's coming back.""

Randy let out a quiet hum and said nothing more.

His friend must've taken the hint because the conversation stopped there.

After three years with him, I knew Randy better than he knew himself. The way his fingertips turned white told me he was far from calm.

Then came a startled exclamation, ""Wait, is it true Audrey has a boyfriend now?""

In an instant, Randy's expression became stormy. He took the phone from his friend's hands, his eyes black and keen with rage.

""He grabbed his coat and rushed out of the bar without saying anything. ""

I couldn't dodge in time and was knocked to the ground by him.

""Sorry.""

He took out his wallet, pulled a stack of cash, and handed it to me. ""I am in a rush and can't take you to the hospital. Take this for your medical bills.""

It all happened so fast.

He didn't even spare me a second glance.

The wound on my arm burned, a searing pain that felt like punishment for overstepping.

My eyes stung as tears pooled before they rolled down my face.

Chapter 3

That night, Randy never returned home.

My calls and texts went unanswered.

Thus, I went to his friend and asked where he was, and the answer I got was, ""Sorry, Debra, I've no idea where he went.""

He sounded apologetic, but there was no evidence of it on his face.

After saying goodbye, I turned back and caught him talking casually with a coworker.

""Did you see that woman just now? She looks a lot like my friend's first love, but no matter how much she resembles her, she is not. The moment my friend saw his first love post a photo with a guy, he panicked and booked a flight to France to pursue her.""

I don't even know how I made it back home. My face was pale as paper. At some point, my knee injury was torn open again and it was bleeding.

But I didn't care. I kept clutching my phone, calling Randy again and again, desperate for him to pick up.

He didn't answer.

My wrist gave out, and the phone fell from my grasp and landed on the carpet.

The screen flashed and then went dark.

Tears rolled down my face and soaked into the carpet beneath me, leaving spots all over.

In the darkness, my throat tightened, and I let out a choking sob.

\*\*\*

Randy's friends were waiting to see me break down and spiral into some hysterical mess over him.

However, as they continued to wait, nothing happened.

I had just finished another show when my assistant ran to me, phone in hand.

""Debra, your phone's been buzzing nonstop. I thought it might be important, so I brought it over.""

I thanked her and took it, only to find that they were all group chat messages.

That night, I had secretly made a new account and used Randy's phone to add myself to their group.

""Randy, there's something wrong with Debra these days. I haven't seen her at all.""

""Yeah, I was waiting for her to come cry and ask about you. I love seeing her look all pitiful.""

It took a bit before Randy responded, ""Do not worry about her. Let her cool off. She's far too clingy. This is a perfect opportunity for me to spend time with Audrey. She just got over a breakup, and I need to be there for her.""

""You got a point. Audrey's far more important. We'll keep an eye on Debra for you. Go win your beauty back, and by then, you won't need that stand-in anymore.""

""Randy's just playing it smart by keeping the backup in case the main plan falls through.""

Randy didn't respond again and went offline.

I let out a bitter chuckle as pain spread quietly from my chest, suffocating me.

To stop myself from thinking about him, I asked the manager to increase my shows to six per week.

Music numbed the pain and brought memories.

I first met Randy at the Twilight Bar. Back then, I was only a small singer, and few people came to hear me sing.

I had few fans, but I did draw the wrong type of attention.

A man offered to be my sugar daddy. When I declined, he became enraged and created a scene, saying in front of everyone that I was nothing more than public property, free to ride.

The manager was too focused on calming the crowd to care about me, let alone defend me.

I was frozen in place, embarrassed and helpless.

Then Randy stepped in. He defended me and took me away from the chaos.

""Don't be afraid. I believe you,"" he said, handing me a tissue. His eyes crinkled, kind and bright.

His few words gave me incredible strength.

I couldn't help but fall for him, who appeared in my world as a savior.

Back then, I was a mess, and I longed for someone to save me and lift me up.

But I forgot that the person didn't need to be Randy.

Chapter 4

By the third month of Randy's disappearance, I was finally over him.

If two years of living apart were enough to justify a divorce, then surely two months of no contact counted as a breakup.

I started packing up his things.

There were a lot of couple items in the house.

Toothbrushes, glasses, towels, and small figurines were arranged in pairs.

I used to tell him over and again, ""See, this is you, and the tiny girl beside you is me. We are meant to be together.""

Randy would smile sweetly. ""Yeah, we're made for each other.""

I'd put my arms around his neck, grinning like a fool and quietly whispering in my heart, ""We'll be together forever.""

But one day, I discovered that the figurines had been moved.

The pair that once stood so close, shoulder to shoulder, were now turned back-to-back, standing far apart.

I stared at them for a moment before packing them up together.

There was too much of his stuff to pack all at once, and lately, I'd been getting home really late, so I left it for now.

Until one day, the group chat blew up.

""Randy, you're finally returning? I really missed you!""

""That's not even the main point. I heard Audrey's coming back with him. Is that true?""

""No way! That means Randy finally got his dream girl! Congrats on ditching Debra and winning the real deal!""

Numerous congratulatory texts followed.

Then Randy sent a photo in the group chat. It was of him and Audrey.

""Yeah, we're coming back.""

They looked like a perfect match, standing side by side.

Just then, I heard a voice urging me to go on stage, so I put down my phone and went on stage.

By the time I picked it up again, it was already late at night.

While I'd been on stage, Randy had sent more messages to the group.

""Is Debra still looking for me?""

""No. As a matter of fact, when I randomly went on her Instagram the other day, I realized she blocked me!""

""I just checked, and she blocked me too. What the hell? Randy, you should check yours. What if she blocked you too?""

The world of lifestyle on July 3, 2025, offered a diverse tapestry of stories, ranging from heartwarming human connections to the intersection of culture and fashion, and the pursuit of longevity and well-being. From the artistic expression of refugees to the global recognition of Indian cuisine, this snapshot reveals a world in constant evolution, reflecting both tradition and innovation.

**Culture and Community:**

A poignant story unfolded in New Delhi, where Afghan refugee artists are using music as a means of healing and cultural preservation. On World Refugee Day, June 21st, a performance at Alliance Française brought together refugees from various countries, with the Afghan band Salaam captivating the audience with their soulful qawwalis. Singing songs by the legendary Afghan artist Farhad Darya, the band channeled a message of peace, highlighting the enduring power of art in the face of displacement and the “desire for homeland.” This reflects the resilience and cultural continuity of the Afghan community, even as their homeland sees an unexpected rise in tourism despite ongoing conflict.

In a different vein, the annual Rath Yatra of Puri, a religious festival, was celebrated in Hauz Khas, Delhi. Now in its 47th year, the event brought the spirit and rituals of the chariot festival to the capital, showcasing the devotion and community of Odia people across the city. The observance included every sacred protocol, echoing the traditions of Puri, reflecting the deep-rooted cultural preservation of this specific ritual.

**Personal Journeys and Human Connection:**

The power of online communities to foster connection and support was highlighted by a Reddit post from a 25-year-old woman searching for her long-lost father. Her heartfelt plea generated an outpouring of support, illustrating the significant impact of online platforms in bridging gaps and connecting individuals.

In the realm of relationships, a storm-chasing couple turned their shared passion for extreme weather into a memorable engagement. Bryce Shelton and Paige Berdomas, who met in the ""weather Twittersphere,"" became engaged in front of a breathtaking tornado in South Dakota. This story encapsulates how shared interests can lead to profound connections and underscores the role of shared experiences in building relationships.

**Fashion and Trends:**

India continues to inspire global luxury houses. Louis Vuitton’s Spring/Summer ’26 menswear collection featured handbags designed as mini auto rickshaws, a nod to India’s beloved local transport. The bags are selling for a staggering 35 lakh rupees. This exemplifies how middle-class cultures can become inspiration for high fashion and highlights the evolving dialogue between global brands and local realities.

**Food and Health:**

Indian cuisine is gaining international acclaim, with TasteAtlas listing five Indian ice creams among the world’s top 100 iconic frozen desserts. Rustom & Co.’s nostalgic Mango Ice Cream Sandwich is still charming generations.

Dr. Pranav Ghody, a consultant endocrinologist, discussed surprising factors that can cause blood sugar levels to spike. Stress, poor sleep, and other everyday elements often overlooked, can significantly affect glucose levels.

Furthermore, a deep dive into the trend of ghee coffee revealed insights into its purported benefits and potential long-term effects. While ghee contains fatty acids that have health benefits, its continuous consumption raises questions about its long-term impact.

**Celebrity Life and Inspiration:**

The dynamic of Amitabh Bachchan and Rekha’s on-screen chemistry and their work on the movie *Silsila* (1981) has always fascinated audiences, fueling discussion and speculation for decades. Reflecting on her 25 years in the film industry, Rekha shared personal insights into working with a co-star over an extended period, suggesting how these experiences can deeply shape an individual.

Max Verstappen, the Red Bull driver, and his parents attended the baptism ceremony of his sister Victoria Verstappen's newborn daughter, reflecting the importance of family amidst his professional success. Also, Maryse, formerly a WWE Divas champion, has moved to a new home with her husband, The Miz, sharing updates on their new life.

Coco Gauff took time out after her heartbreak in Wimbledon to attend a Faye Webster concert in London. The tournament took place from June 30 to July 13, 2025. Gauff lost in the first round of the tournament and lost in the Berlin Open as well.

**Beauty and Wellness:**

Japanese lifestyle habits are being recognized for their role in promoting longevity. The emphasis is on how longevity is a byproduct of everyday life rather than a standalone goal. Focus areas include facial massages, matcha, and rice water for hair.

In conclusion, the lifestyle news on July 3, 2025, encompassed a wide range of topics, from the preservation of culture through art and the embrace of community bonds to the exploration of beauty and wellness practices. These diverse stories reveal the multifaceted nature of human experience and the constant evolution of how we live, connect, and find meaning in our everyday lives.

1lr75dv,https://www.reddit.com/r/JamesHoffmann/comments/1lr75dv/high_humidified_coffee_i_gave_it_a_try/,High Humidified Coffee: I gave it a try..;,"
Back about 5 years ago James Hoffmann did some testing with coffee from beans that stayed in a controlled humidity environment for a month as I recall.  I watch the videos back then and I found it interesting.  It got filled away in a cabinet in my head someplace under, “Things to Try Sometime.’  It’s the file that just keeps getting larger.

Well, I finally decided to give it a try.  So I contacted the people at Boveda to see if they had a recommendation for the environment for coffee beans.  They are the company that manufactures the most simple yet best 2-way humidification control system.  Using the salt and retention goo in their packets cannot be patented.  Their secret sauce is the permeable film packet that contains the liquid goo while allowing water vapor to pass through to regulate the humidity.  If it’s too high, water is removed or if the air is too dry, it allows water vapor out to be absorbed into the air.

The good people at Boveda recommend their 69% humidity pack.  I was surprised that the recommended humidity packet is what I use in my humidifier.  I picked out a spare packet and tossed it in my coffee canister.  It had about 8oz of original 12oz so I will refer to this one as C1.  In a second canister I placed 12oz of the same espresso blend this is C2.  For the next week I only used C2 got my espresso.  The beans in C1 just sat unused as they equalized to the new environment. 

After the week, I made an espresso with C2 in my grinder. I brewed it and it was as I expected.  It was as good as normal.  For my second espresso, I used the beans in C1, 18 grams of beans in the grinder with no changes to the grinder setup.  Every step was my normal routine.  Spritz the beans, grind, use my spiral planetary geared WDT tool. Then level up, tamp and into the machine and lock in the portafilter.

I hit start snd a few seconds pass and…everything went off the rails.  Channeling like I have never seen.  Where there was one a few minutes prior, the C1 had multiple channels, like 5 or 6.  It took about 14 seconds to hit 38 grams in the cup.  I let it run to 25 seconds and it hit 73 grams.  I figured I must have messed up the process so another try.  It was the same thing.

Now, I start chasing the grind.  It ended up that it ended up that a significant change in the grind.  I needed to go down 11 clicks. Finally, C1 gives the same results as the unhumidified coffee in C2.  The difference is, I interpret it to be less bright and more sweetness.  I’m still trying to figure out why the big change on the grind happened.  I expected some but not this much of a change.  Nothing has changed between C1 and C2.  I need to change the grinder the 11 clicks going back and forth between the two.

Has anyone else had this happen?

I got it used for cheap a little while back after a semi wrecked my other car. Its current problem is the breaks. It first occurred when I was in a drive thru getting coffee. When I attempted to pull forward to the second window I couldn't stop. It took my reaction skill and about 3 extra feet to stop. It happened again shortly after, when I was pulling out on to the road. Thankfully, there were no cars when that happened. I brought my car immediately to a shop. They looked around and decided my break fluid needed to be flushed, all and well. I brought it home shortly after and the breaks felt stronger, even was able to drive it three hours back to my home city. No problems. Two days after, my car's breaks failed again, once again in a drive thru, but was able to bring it back. Brought it to another shop, and they couldn't find anything that would be contributing to this. It happened again after the second time being at the shop, as I was backing into my driveway. 

No damages has been done as i've taken extra caution. But having my breaks fail on me while driving is terrifying. I'll be pushing down on the break pedal, and i'll still get movement. I push all the way down to the floor when it happens, I can feel it, but there's still movement. It's hard to explain, in the moment I'm more worried about gaining control of my car, rather than inspect the issue. I was wondering if anyone had a single clue as to what it would be? Anything would be greatly appreciated. I'm having another person drive my car around, hitting drive thrus (where the problem seems more pronounced), driving around parking lots, etc. Hopefully another person might be able to describe the issue more accurately than me, and i'm hoping it's not just human error, although I doubt it has its happened repeatedly. 

Again, any help would be greatly appreciated. My apologies for the rambling, I wanted to clarify what steps i've gone through already. ",1,1751594325.0,AskMechanics,1,1.0,False

I thought I should write a cruise report while it is still fresh in my memory. It is a long one. Hopefully someone with a similar interest or background would find this useful or at the very least,  AI can use this to answer someone’s question.

Here it is:

Background:

We are a family of 4 (with 2 teenage boys) from the U.S. We have cruised as a family 6 times, all of them are with Royal Caribbean in the Caribbean and Mexico areas. This is our first time cruising with Celebrity.

We are somewhat familiar with Japan, the culture, the cuisine and public transportation system. I have been there 5 times but never by cruise ship. We can’t speak Japanese nor understand the language. We are not a big outdoor or adventurous family. We prefer comfort and convenience. We travel mostly for food. 

**Pre-Cruise - At the Airport**

We landed in Narita, one of the two major international airports in Tokyo (Haneda is the other one). Going through Japanese immigration and customs was  a breeze. We filled out our arrival information online and showed the immigration officer the QR codes on our phones. 

We brought 0 yen from the U.S. and withdrew some yen using an ATM machine right outside of custom. We have an ATM card from Schwab which reimburses any ATM fees. We only exchanged enough to purchase limousine bus tickets and Welcome Suica cards. Welcome Suica card is a 30-day e-money card than be used for riding trains and purchasing items at convenience stores.

Throughout our trip, we exchanged more money at ATMs in 7-Elevens as needed. Mostly, it was for recharging our Suica cards (I.e. adding more money to it). After the first few transactions, I found that the exchange rate from my Amex and Delta Platinum cards are slightly better than the ATM exchange rate, so I tried to use credit cards as much as possible. Other than for recharging Suica cards, there was only one restaurant during our trip that only accepted cash.

**Hotel - Hyatt Regency in Yokohama**

We stayed in Hyatt Regency 1 night before and 2 nights after the cruise.

**Getting to the Hotel**

Compared to Haneda, Narita is further away from Tokyo / Yokohama. We used the “Limousine Bus” service which took us directly from the airport to the nearest stop to our hotel in Yokohama. The trip took about 90 minutes. We purchased the bus tickets at the Narita airport using a vending machine. It is 4,000 yen one way per person. I couldn’t remember if there was a credit card option but we did use cash to purchase the tickets. We found the limousine bus is very convenient for us especially with large luggages. They have staff that load and unload luggages for us. The tickets had assigned seats.

Since Hyatt Regency is not one of the stops, we got off at Intercontinental Hotel in Yokohama, the nearest stop to our hotel. From there, we used Uber to Hyatt, which is about 10 minutes away.

Uber app works the same as in the U.S except the cars are basically taxis driven by licensed taxi drivers. 

Most taxi drivers in Japan don’t speak English so we loved that we could use the app to set the destination. There were only a couple of times in Japan where we used taxis directly without the Uber app. We just pulled up the address on my phone and showed it to the driver. We were able to use credit cards for taxis.

**Hotel Rooms**

We have 2 connecting rooms. Room size is slightly bigger than the typical hotel room size in U.S, which is a lot bigger than average room size in Central Tokyo. We chose not to include breakfast in our reservations and ended up buying food from convenience stores or had breakfast at restaurants near the hotel.

**Location**

The hotel is about 10 minutes away using Uber from the cruise terminal where Celebrity Millennium is leaving from and about 20 minutes away from where Millennium disembarked. 

There is Yokohama Chinatown nearby with many Chinese restaurants and there are Lawson and 7-Eleven stores nearby where we spent a lot of time in, getting water, protein drinks, milk, bread, onigiri, coffee and ATM service. The Yokohama baseball stadium is also within a walking distance.

There is a coin laundromat within walking distance where we used it twice, before and after the cruise. (We spent a few days in Taiwan before our cruise)

**Cruise - What we purchased**

We booked 2 Ocean View cabins directly from the Celebrity website. They were Cabin #2082 and #2086, right next to each other. We intentionally chose the right side of the ship given that it is a clockwise itinerary. We were hoping to get a better view of the land throughout the cruise. 

The cabins were fine. We knew that Millennium was an older ship but she was refurbished a few years ago which I think made a huge difference.

We decided to do 100% DIY, 0 excursions purchased either from Celebrity or private tour companies. We just relied on Google Maps and Google Translate.

We also didn’t purchase the cruise internet package and relied on our phone international data plan. Given that this is a port heavy itinerary, we did get internet coverage most of the time. Even when we were at sea between ports, surprisingly the internet worked better than I expected, especially on the ship’s side that is close to the land (where our rooms were at).

We didn’t purchase any specialty dining package. We found the main dining and buffet were just fine. The best food of this itinerary is off the ship, if you enjoy non-Western food.

We purchased travel insurance through GeoBlue.

**Cruise - Boarding**

We arrived at the Yokohama cruise terminal at 11:30AM, 30 minutes before our boarding time. We were assigned a group number for our boarding. We waited in the terminal for probably about 15-20 minutes before our group number was called and boarded the ship.

We went straight to our muster station location, completed the safety checklist and had a quick lunch at the buffet. Our rooms were ready by 1:00PM but our luggages were delivered a bit later.

Our cruise director did a roll call as part of the first night entertainment and we learned that there were 2,300 passengers on our cruise with the U.S. representing about 60%, followed by Mexico and Canada. There were a total of 40 countries that made up the demographic. 

**Cruise - Shimizu**

Celebrity provided free shuttles from the cruise terminal to 2 stops: Shin-Shimizu station and JR Shimizu station. We got off at the 2nd stop because we wanted to take the train to a town closest to Mount Fuji. The train ride was probably about 40 minutes.

We used the Welcome Suica cards for the train. There was a long line at the station where cruise passengers were purchasing train tickets. We just walked past everyone, scanned the cards at the gate and went straight to the train terminals.

Unfortunately, Mount Fuji was not visible that day because of the cloud coverage but we did have a good meal in Aeon Mall and the train ride was quite pleasant.

On the way back to the ship, we stopped by at a fish market which is one train stop away from the cruise terminal. We had a late lunch there before heading back to the ship.

**Cruise - Osaka**

https://preview.redd.it/e3e6rpbybraf1.jpg?width=2201&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0f684365752ad074629bf40f3f4e56e9abe1545b

No shuttles were provided but the train station is walkable from the terminal. We arrived at Osaka Port Tempozan Wharf. There is a mini mall right outside of the terminal that has several restaurants, Daiso (basically like a dollar store), fake food store, arcade and a giant Ferris Wheel, which has a great view of the city and the ship.

https://preview.redd.it/flw4kvhiiraf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5df40e126dfedc8e882fb8dd6ca537219e18231b

We arrived at around 11AM. Since the ship would be docked overnight, we decided to visit Kyoto and Nara on the first day so we didn’t have to worry about getting back to the ship in time. It was a hot and humid day so we ended up shopping around in Kyoto station and had a nice lunch there. From Kyoto station, we took a train to Nara Park, which is famous for the deers. Deers were everywhere at the park. You can feed them biscuits that you can purchase at the park and they would bow to you.The next day, we spent some time in Osaka station and Dotonbori area in Osaka before we left for Kochi.

**Cruise - Kochi**

There is a free shuttle from the cruise terminal (Misato Wharf No 7-3) to the Harimaya Bridge - Tourist Bus terminal. Kochi is famous for their caves and mountains but we didn’t do any of those. From the bus terminal, we walked through shopping districts and visited Kochi castle.

https://preview.redd.it/tdjxd17wiraf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a65aa0f15022a001311b19b984de60258e53e859

After Kochi castle, we went to a mall and took Uber back to the terminal. Our taxi driver was very friendly. We basically used Google Translate app, conversed during the whole ride back to the terminal.

**Cruise - Hiroshima**

https://preview.redd.it/qd3z4586braf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cf5b0dfcab9a7a912d4276fe7974be0c1acfb643

Free shuttle for Hiroshima Port station and we took a tram to the Hiroshima Peach Memorial Park. There was a ferry that can take you to Miyajima Island, home to the world-famous floating torii gate of Itsukushima Shrine but unfortunately it was a low-tide day when we got there so the ferry was not in service, at least not from the memorial park.

Since the next stop is South Korea, we had to go through an immigration formality when we got back on the ship. It was a quick process but we did have our passports checked by Japanese immigration staff at the terminal.

**Cruise - Busan, South Korea**

https://preview.redd.it/ha1kcrubaraf1.jpg?width=3143&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=412351c58ab73bbd8e42aaccdb87478906f14b8d

We read online stories about long immigration line entering or leaving Korea but it wasn’t an issue for us. We went through the process quickly. I didn’t remember waiting for more than 10 minutes.

Free shuttle to Busan Station. From there we took Uber to the Jagalchi fish market. It is a 2 story building where we picked fresh seafood on the 1st floor. The vendor took the seafood to the 2nd floor where they cooked them for us.

https://preview.redd.it/4bdvfee0jraf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d28455e32e895d9d3a0d9b315f83a3f1c87fa911

From there, we went to Lotte mall and went to the top of the building, which has an amazing view of Busan.

**Cruise - Hakodate**

https://preview.redd.it/qsldpz01craf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=419fd5c4ff18d822ac80fdb75594df15f799379a

Since we technically reentered Japan from a foreign country, we had to go through an immigration formality again where we had our passport stamped. This took a bit longer than I expected just because there were a lot of passengers going ashore at the same time. Despite that, Celebrity and Japanese staff did a good job directing traffic and made sure that we didn’t wait in open areas under the sun. The ship arrived at the port at 11AM. The whole immigration process probably took about 30-45 minutes. So make sure you eat something first.

There is a morning fish market (close at 2PM) where you can have fresh seafood right outside of the terminal. We walked 1.6km uphill to the ropeway station that took us to the top of Mount Hakodate which has a nice view of the city. 

We stopped by to have Hakodate style ramen, which has clean and delicate broth, influenced by Chinese, before heading back to the ship.

https://preview.redd.it/ipuo8ha4jraf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e6fc6c0489fdaea44dfa0fc54d66d51b5f5645b

We were kind of early so we decided to walk to the Hakodate train station. There was some sort of strip mall with restaurants where we had Hakodate squid as a late afternoon snack.

There is no Uber in Hakodate. 

**Cruise - Aomori**

https://preview.redd.it/vcu01foqeraf1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=42c0cd8123d1312f1f71ead2a559b6b61bfe2650

We walked around the pier and took Uber to the city to do some shopping. We had a late start and decided to just look for some stuff at Uniqlo and Don Quijote. We had tsukemen, which is a dipping ramen noodle with seafood broth.

**Cruise - Last Day**

Celebrity announced that they would have an “Extragavanza Buffet” for lunch. They served chilled lobster tails and shrimps, carving station, biryani rice and some other Indian dishes, seafood pancit (Filipino food) and a ton of desserts.

https://preview.redd.it/ifb6se03kraf1.jpg?width=2197&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=08958fa9ff58c4bcf7a38a5b155eb34025679ba2

**Post Cruise - Hyatt Regency in Yokohama**

We chose the latest disembarkation time using the Celebrity app, which is 8:55AM. We opted for the luggage service, which means that we packed everything the night before and left our luggage outside our room by 10PM. Our stateroom attendant picked them up that night and our luggage was waiting for us at the terminal on the disembarkation day.

We had to leave our cabins by 7:30AM. We had our breakfast at the main dining room, which was less crowded than the buffet.

Celebrity used a “Silent Disembarkation” process where instead of announcing group numbers, they relied on the Celebrity app notification. So, make sure to have the app installed and activated.

We didn’t use Celebrity’s airport / hotel transfer and used taxis instead. There was a long line for taxis outside of the terminal but it moved quickly. There were celebrity / terminal staff directing traffic. Everything was organized. 

Uber does not pick up from the cruise terminal.

We had 2 days after the cruise where we spent mostly in Shinjuku, Akihabara and Odaiba. Central Tokyo areas are about 1 hour away from Yokohama by trains. We spent our days mostly shopping and eating. We did go to Team Lab Planet in Tokyo, which was a blast for everyone.

**Post Cruise - Getting back to the U.S.**

We took Uber from the hotel to Yokohama station. We stored our luggage in Yokohama City Air Terminal (YCAT), which is on the first floor of Sky Building, connected to the Yokohama station. We did our final shopping there. There is a Pokémon Center, which is not as crowded compared to the one in Tokyo, SOGO department store and TAKASHIMAYA. Plenty of restaurants too.

After that, we took a Limousine Bus to Haneda terminal 3, which is 650 yen per person.

Conclusion:

Overall, we enjoyed the trip. We loved the fact that we woke up in the morning and got to experience different parts of Japan. We didn’t have to worry about meals (especially breakfast and dinner) or changing hotels. 

There is enough variety among ports that we don’t feel bored or trapped on a 12 day cruise trip. The locals seem genuinely happy to see us. They never pushed us to buy anything. Shop or restaurant prices near the terminals didn’t seem to be inflated, at least not significantly. Credit cards were accepted almost everywhere. Lack of Japanese wasn’t an issue. 

We also enjoyed the different entertainment that Celebrity provided. We had singers, dancers, Taiko drummers, Broadway stars, aerial acrobats and Jeremy Tan, a mind reader/illusionist.

Patrick, our cruise director, was fantastic. 

Compared to what we used to with Royal Caribbean, this is a smaller ship with an older crowd, so our teenagers found that the sports court wasn’t as busy as on Royal Caribbean ships.

We did find that Japan in June was hot and humid. As we travelled to northern Japan, like Hakodate and Aomori, it got a little bit better but for most of the trip, it could get pretty challenging walking outside during daytime. 

Throughout the trip, we tried to respect Japanese culture and etiquette. Japanese tend to not talk loud in trains or elevators. They also don’t eat or drink while in motion.

We are glad that we did it. Hopefully, it created lasting memories for our family and maybe it will do the same for yours too.

I know you should always respect your best friend’s choices, but Adam made it difficult. His family was rich, and I mean RICH.

Initially, I actually liked him.

When Astrid first introduced us, he seemed like a pretty chill guy.

I think it was the way he spoke that enchanted me. 

Adam had a way with words, almost like everything he said was a song lyric. 

He was well-spoken, like he’d been chewing on a thesaurus, but I liked that about him.

Adam was different from any guy I’d met. All of Astrid’s boyfriends had been questionable. 

Adam was different. 

He talked her through panic attacks and helped her with breathing exercises. 

He’d sprint to the store to buy an umbrella when the sky started to darken. 

He was everything I wanted to be if I was brave enough to tell her my feelings.

But this post isn’t about Astrid and me.

It’s about Adam and his family.

I’ve known Astrid since we were little kids. 

Astrid wasn’t just my best friend. 

She was my other half. My soulmate. 

I admit it, yes, I loved her more than she loved me. And I was planning on telling her that.

But life gets in the way, you know? 

I have a religious mother, so something as important and emotional as coming out meant a lot to me. It became even harder when she started getting serious with guys.

Casual hook-ups turned into relationships that only lasted a few weeks or months because it was always the guy who suddenly turned on her.

She was always the metaphorical punching bag in these relationships, and I couldn’t fucking stand it. 

Oh, an old guy friend from school liked her Instagram post? Immediately, it was *her* fault.

Astrid was too nice. Too naive. I loved her, but part of me wanted to shake her and tell her that saying *no* was okay. 

She didn’t have to date these guys just to make them happy. 

Then along came Adam, who swept her away. Quite literally. 

The two of them met while we were studying in a Starbucks. 

I was trying to describe a TV show I’d been watching, using wild hand movements like I was playing charades, which had sent her into fits of laughter.

Astrid was choking on her coffee, which made me laugh too. 

Those were the moments I treasured—just the two of us, hanging out and laughing over stupid shit.

I don’t know if it was my frantic hand movements or her hysterical laughter that caught his attention. 

Before I knew what was happening, Adam was crashing into our lives.

The guy sitting across from us, the one I’d glimpsed peeking over his dog-eared copy of Oedipus Rex, slid his chair over with an award-winning grin. 

His wide eyes were locked onto my best friend, and I didn’t blame him. 

Astrid reminded me of sunlight. 

I don’t think she was ever conventionally attractive; I just think I was in love with everything else.

She lit up every room she was in with just a smile and a laugh, and somehow, just her presence made me feel good.

In the beginning, I think that’s what drew Adam in.

Like a moth to a flame. 

Astrid was beautiful to me, but I think it was her smile, the way her entire body vibrated with laughter, that sealed the deal for him.

The two of them exchanged numbers, and then Adam was suddenly a daily presence in our lives. Not just hers. Mine. 

Adam was pretentious, but in a “hot” way, according to Astrid. 

Yes, he could tell me with a straight face about all these artsy movies and that they were revolutionary, and Midsommer was a “spiritual” experience for him, but he could also sit and watch a comedy movie with us and laugh like an idiot. 

The three of us began hanging out.

It was fun. I liked his jokes, and his sardonic attitude. 

I liked his obsession with abolishing the patriarchy. I liked that he made Astrid smile, and she hadn’t once needed my support in public places.

Adam was always with her, holding her hand, talking about pretentious shit I couldn’t really understand. 

But I liked his voice. 

He had a lot of stories about vacations he’d been on, and his time at boarding school.

Adam was a good storyteller, and Astrid was always locked into a sort of trance, her eyes wide, lips slightly agape as he dramatically re-enacted the time he had almost joined a boarding school cult. 

Okay, I've said the thing I liked about him, because he wasn’t all bad at the beginning of their relationship. 

But like I said, the more time he spent with us, practically shoving himself into our lives and demanding to be given attention, I started to see his *act*. 

Initially, it was just small things. 

“You can’t afford *twenty dollars*?”

He didn’t sound like he was intentionally being a dick.

Adam looked confused, one brow raised, his chin resting on his fist. 

I figured he was just out of touch after finding out his family were insanely rich. 

I didn’t really think much about it, until I refused to buy a cocktail at a club, and again, he had given me that *look*. This time he was fully looking down on me. 

Instead of questioning me, he reached into his wallet with an over-exaggerated sigh, pulled out a wad of cash, and slammed it down on the bar. 

Okay, so, I was really drunk. 

Several strawberry daiquiris down, I had no interest in buying a cocktail that sounded like a euphemism. 

I would usually stay quiet, but at that point, I was pissed.

So, I made a point of sliding the money back to him, getting up, and pulling my best friend onto the dance floor. 

Adam joined us after acting like a spoiled child, realizing neither of us was going to buy into his shit, and I forgot about his clearly out-of-touch bullshit.

But then that kind of shit kept happening, and happening, until he finally revealed his true colors and freaked out at a restaurant that had seated us near “other people.”

By other people, he meant *normal* people. 

Adam said it was because of privacy but had zero problem when a high-profile singer came to sit near us. 

Astrid yelled at him and made a deal that he wasn't like that, and Adam pulled a face like a fucking second grader, only promising not to do it again when she threatened to leave him.

When we left the restaurant, he dumped money on a homeless person.

“What?""

Adam had this psychotic grin, watching the homeless man dive to grab the cash, stuffing each bill into his oversized trench coat. 

His eyes pricked with malice I had never seen before. 

He was enjoying the poor man’s very brief moment of joy. 

Adam nudged me with a laugh. “I told you I like *those* types of people!”

Again, he tried to justify it by saying he was giving to charity, which Astrid bought, hook, line, and sinker. 

I stopped hanging out with them because, every time we did, he would either go on an out-of-touch rant or be passive-aggressive to others.

All with this handsome smile and quirk of an eyebrow that was not cute in the slightest. This guy was an overgrown rat.

When I tried to tell her he was bad news, those interventions turned into arguments, and, unbelievably, she would call Adam to come and “act as the peacemaker.”

So, in short, I didn’t like him.

I didn’t like that he was fake and had already brainwashed my best friend with the promise of a life of luxury.

It was on April Fools’ Day that I got the text I didn’t think I’d be getting for at least ten years. We were twenty years old. 

The two of us had made a promise to each other that we would go traveling during our gap year. 

I thought it was an April Fools’ joke, and I repeatedly asked her if she was playing some kind of sick prank. But no.

Sent along with a message that just said, “We’re getting married!” 

Astrid, standing under a perfect sunset in some unknown location, maybe Bali—an engagement ring on her finger, her arms wrapped around a grinning Adam.

Astrid sent me a follow-up message asking if I would be her bridesmaid. 

I was speechless. She had barely known this guy for a few months, and she was marrying him? 

The last thing I wanted was to walk away from a lifelong friendship over a guy.

But this was *Adam*.

Adam, who was the most out-of-touch person I had ever met.

Adam, who snorted when I said I couldn’t pay for my phone contract and then offered to pay the whole thing for me.

These were not nice things.

He knew exactly what he was doing, and that was putting me in my place and reminding me that I was lesser than him.

Fuck, he even did it with Astrid when they started dating, laughing when she mentioned her mom’s house wasn’t mortgaged, and then asking if she was being serious.

He paid the whole thing off for her with a patronizing flip of his hair.

I did agree to go to the wedding.

After a lot of thought, I came to the realization that I was being childish. She was my best friend. I didn’t want things to move so fast, but of course, they did. 

Astrid started skipping class for sudden, unexpected trips to France. 

Her dress would be fitted by only the top designers. 

Which Adam had mentioned only a *thousand fucking times*.

He made it his mission to tell me my dress would have to be store-bought from a boutique because his mom didn’t know me well enough to include me in the fittings.

Astrid, however, called him out on it and insisted on all of the bridesmaid dresses coming from the boutique.

For which he paid. Obviously.

I don’t think there was ever a time when he let us pay for our own drinks or food. 

It pissed off Astrid at the start, though I think she got used to it. 

Wedding planning was something I had always dreamed of doing, especially for Astrid. 

I wanted to spend a whole night with her where it was just us, she would give me a basic idea and theme of what she wanted, and I would make that happen. 

Lo and behold, I got a text from her saying I didn’t need to do anything, that the wedding was already planned.

I thought that was strange, but I didn’t question it. 

Adam said he had everything under control, so I just smiled and nodded and resisted the urge to punch him in the face. 

It was pastel-themed. Astrid’s dress was a beautiful shade of pink, like a darker coral, while the bridesmaid dresses were pastel blue. 

I think Astrid was going for a fairy theme, or something close to it.

When I arrived for the rehearsal dinner, the theme was already set up.

I wasn’t expecting the actual ceremony to be at Adam’s house. 

Honestly, I was half-expecting him to announce that he’d bought Buckingham Palace. 

The house was exactly what I expected: a mansion with too many windows, too many doors, and a startling number of unnecessary swimming pools.

The ceremony itself was held outside, and once I jumped out of the Uber, my stomach swimming with nerves, I took a moment to take in the scene. Astrid had chosen a night wedding because she wanted it to be moonlit.

Magical.

I never really understood what she meant until I saw the setup, rows of pearly white benches canopied by cherry blossom trees strung with soft white lights. 

The benches themselves were tangled with wildflowers and greenery, vines and tendrils wrapping around the armrests. 

Entranced by the sight, I had a moment of realization: my best friend was about to walk down the aisle I was standing on and give herself to a man and I despised.

I should have been happy for her, but all I could really feel was frustration and a twist in my gut that was definitely jealousy.

Luckily, alcohol exists, and the rehearsal dinner wasn’t as bad as I’d thought.

I spent most of the night on the dance floor with Astrid, until Adam’s mother, a witchy woman with a patient smile, pulled her away to go over last-minute preparations.

So, I retreated to the snack table, which had to feature the most obnoxious food possible. 

I didn’t think it was physically possible to roast a full pig, but there it was, sitting with an apple lodged in its mouth. 

I knew I was being unsociable, but the other guests made no effort to speak to me. And when they did, it was with a wide, knowing smile that didn’t need words: Why are *you* here?

They knew who Astrid was, squealing and hugging her like they had been best friends their entire lives. 

But when I tried to join in or offer my name, I was greeted with dead-eyed stares. 

These girls weren’t even pretending to be nice. They looked at me and scoffed.

Just like Adam. 

I guessed half the people our age were trust fund kids he had grown up with.

At that point, I was close to leaving.

The wedding was set for 11:45, and I was hoping to get back to my hotel room and psyche myself up for what I was sure was going to be a night of hell.

Before long, the wedding had finally arrived. 

The sky was the perfect oblivion Astrid had hoped for, meaning a moonlit ceremony, and I was trying, and failing, to suppress the urge (now slightly tipsy) to pull my best friend aside and demand she call the whole thing off.

Because it was stupid. It was fucking stupid. Old Astrid wouldn’t have even liked it.

She would have raised her eyebrows at everything being so perfectly placed, at the handwritten notes on each table.

I refused to get ready with the other girls after walking in to find one of them mocking my lisp.

The dress was beautiful.

I did a little squee moment in the mirror. 

I thought the flower crowns for both the bridesmaids and groomsmen would be over the top, but I was wrong.

I guess what I wasn’t expecting was for the wedding to be… spread out? Is that the right word?

What I mean is, we didn’t have to sit down.

You could stand or sit wherever you liked.

I had been dreading sitting on the benches, but it seemed they were reserved for Adam’s immediate family, while the rest of us just had to stand around.

Another thing. I had been informed five minutes before stepping out of the fitting room that I wouldn’t be standing with the other bridesmaids. 

Again, an “inner family” thing.

Which, honestly, I was happy about.

After a while of trailing behind Astrid, telling her how beautiful she looked, I pulled her into a hug, whispered good luck, and made my way to the refreshments table.

11:35.

I glanced at my phone, noticing how the mood had shifted from girls dragging each other around for selfies and guys hyping themselves up to a more mellow murmur as the lights in the trees began to dim.

I noticed the reflection of a half-crescent moon slowly bleeding from the clouds onto a silver platter on the table. 

Adam and Astrid must have timed it perfectly. 

Like the lights on the trees, the moon almost mimicked them, not too bright, but ethereal when you really looked at it.

I was so entranced by the silvery glow slowly enveloping the sky that I barely noticed a figure looming behind me.

“Are you ‘er mate?”

It wasn’t just the voice that surprised me. It was the accent.

I had seen a lot of things at that party, things that had to be seen to be believed during my time stumbling around trying to find a bathroom. 

(A guy snorting coke off a girl’s stomach, an orgy in one of the many, many bedrooms featuring a diamond-encrusted dildo.) 

But a British guy? That, I wasn’t expecting.

The guy looked as uncomfortable as I felt, dressed in matching colors. 

Instead of a dress, he wore a long-sleeved shirt a shade lighter than what I had on, tight black pants, and a flower crown awkwardly perched on dark curls that I knew had been tamed by fingers that weren’t his. 

He looked around my age. 

From the way he gingerly held his champagne glass and poked at shrimp tartare and violet-colored macarons, I could tell this guy wasn’t part of Adam’s inner circle. 

I wasn’t sure what to focus on, the awkward way he saluted me with his drink, or the blonde girl hiding behind him. 

The ceremony was starting.

Without thinking, I downed my champagne, the sudden explosion of fizz overwhelming my mouth. 

“Astrid?” I spoke through a sour-lemon grimace, replying to his earlier question. 

Until then, I had been sipping in intervals because it tasted like rotten orange. 

“Yeah, I’m her…” I choked, spluttering on another cough. “... friend.” I briefly forgot my own name. “I’m, uh, I'm, um.. Penny?”

The guy’s lips quirked into a smile.

“Penny with a question mark.” He mulled my name over. “Did that taste good?”

“Yes,” I said, a little too fast. 

He grinned. “Liar.”

When I didn’t reply, he leaned against the table, then immediately sprang back when he realized tables like that weren’t meant for casually leaning on. “I'm Spencer,” he said. “I went to boarding school with Adam.”

All around us, guests were starting to shush each other, but Spencer continued talking loudly. 

“Adam and I have known each other since we were little kids. In fact, I was his best friend.” he spoke with a sour irony I was too tipsy to fully understand. 

I nodded slowly. “So, you’re his best man?”

“Seriously?” Spencer pulled a face. “Wait, you think I'm *friends* with him? I haven't spoken to him since we were sixteen. The asshole’s mother got me kicked out of school because, apparently, I was a bad influence.”

He winked, reaching into his pocket and pulled something out, a baggie of white powder. “Annnd it turns out, she was *right*.”

“That’s *sugar*, darling.”

The blonde girl, who had been practically bouncing behind him, finally strode forward, flinging an arm around Spencer. 

He tried to inch away before she dragged him back, grinning.

She shot me a wide smile. “Have you ever read TFIOS?”

I blinked at her, suddenly wary of speaking too loudly. The moon was yet to fully emerge. I think that was what Astrid was waiting for.

“…What?”

“The Fault in Our Stars,” the girl said with an eye roll. She nudged him. “That’s Spencer in a nutshell! He’s a walking John Green novel, and he wants everyone to know it.”

When I frowned at her, she shrugged. “The sugar’s a metaphor! Because of course it is.”

When Spencer sent me a panicked look, she rested her head on his shoulder. “It’s okay to grow up, you know,” she teased.

“You can let go of this…” She paused for effect before grabbing two macarons and stuffing them into her mouth. “…phase.”

For a moment, I thought she was joking before it dawned on me that they were being completely serious.

Rich kids.

“I wasn’t *joking*,” Spencer grumbled, slipping the sugar back into his pocket, his cheeks going a little pink.

He shrugged, stepping away from the blonde. I noticed a certain vulnerability when he spoke about him and Adam, a certain twitch in his lip. 

He was pissed. 

“Adam’s psycho bitch of a mother got me kicked out of school, after we…”

He trailed off, a reddish blush blooming across cheeks. 

The blonde shot him a knowing grin. “I'm sorry, did you get a little choked up? Oh, my god, like, that's so fucking adorable!”

“Drop it.” he spoke through gritted teeth. 

“Hmm?” she laughed. “Wait, are we talking about *why* you were kicked out, or why you no longer have brunch with our circle?”

Spencer averted his gaze, and she spluttered, giving him a passive-aggressive nudge. 

“Ohhh, you mean when your Daddy went, like, broke?""

He curled his lip. “Evie, you *know* that's not what I'm talking about–”

“I’m Evangeline!” The girl  cut him off, thrusting out her hand, talking to me. 

She reminded me of the human version of a golden retriever, blonde curls bouncing on her shoulders. 

Her dress looked perfect on her, and the flower crown was the icing on the cake. 

She kept playing with it, fixing it onto her curls. 

“I also went to boarding school with Adam, and we actually dated a few times in junior year! However, it turned out our *dearest* Adam was fucking someone behind my back.”

When I couldn't respond, she  bopped me on the head. 

“Oh my god, I love your crown! You’re Penny, right? I'm Evangeline! But you can call me Evie!""

This girl was speaking so fast I could barely keep up with her. 

I nodded dizzily. “I like your dress,” I managed to get out. 

Evie inclined her head, her eyes narrowing. “You think I'm hot?”

Her smile widened when my cheeks erupted into flames. “Oh my god, wait, are you, like *crushing* on me? That's so cute!”

She grabbed my hands and did a little dance, pulling me with her. 

“Astrid told me so much about you! Like, on our trip a few weeks ago, she told me you’ve been best friends your whole lives. I’m so jealous! You’re like, soooo cute! I love your dress!”

“It’s literally the *exact* same as yours,” Spencer rolled his eyes, downing another glass of champagne. 

In response, she thwacked him. “You're lucky you're even here, Setori,” she chirped, “Did you get the bus here, Spencer?”

His expression hardened, but he played along, mimicking her smile. 

Spencer leaned back, once again, almost toppling over the refreshments table. 

“I'm *so* sorry you're yet to get over your mean girl phase at the grown age of fucking *twenty* years old.”

Evie just grinned. “It's because I *like* you, babes!”

Spencer downed another glass of champagne, spitting out, “Ditto.”

Oh, wow. 

I stood, feeling incredibly uncomfortable in my thrifted heels. 

These two were *fun*. 

I did notice Spencer’s gaze kept scanning the crowd for Adam, and I started wondering what had happened between the two of them. 

However, I was more intrigued by what Spencer meant when he referred to Adam’s mother as “psychotic.”

Before I could speak up and snap him out of the trance he’d fallen into, his eyes suddenly on the sky, Evangeline whispered, “It’s starting!” 

I twisted around with the rest of the wedding party, and there she was. 

I remember thinking it was magical how the moon illuminated her, turning her ethereal as she floated down the aisle.

But then I wasn’t thinking of anything.

I was only thinking of Astrid and how angelic she looked. 

I caught her radiant smile, and it hit me. I could let go of my hatred for Adam if it meant she was going to be happy. 

I promised her.

Hours earlier, the two of us had sat together, crying and sharing memories of the mock weddings we used to have as little kids.

Then she had turned to me and told me the best wedding gift I could ever give her was myself.

Being there.

And that was enough to swallow my pride and watch her join hands with the love of her life.

When their vows were exchanged, the moon strayed in the sky, like she was listening.

They said the most important part:

""Till death do us part.""

Astrid turned to me suddenly, her eyes shining.

""Right, Penn?""

The wedding party’s attention was suddenly on me, and something twisted in my gut. Evangeline, standing next to me, nudged me playfully.

“Say yes, babes!”

“I… yes?” I said it more like a question, but I guess that was enough.

I thought the odd intrusion was over before Adam, still holding Astrid’s hand, nodded at Spencer.

""Till death do us part, Spence.""

Spencer looked startled for a moment, lifting a brow.

He shot me a slightly panicked look, which meant I wasn’t crazy. 

This was definitely weird. 

I was pretty sure the bride and groom weren’t supposed to rope other people into their vows. 

“Say it.”

Adam’s voice was strangely cold, and the knot in my gut tightened.

“Uh, sure?”

Spencer smiled and nodded, though his voice had a sarcastic drawl.

It wasn’t until I truly took in my surroundings that I noticed the moon’s light was spread unevenly. 

The bride and groom stood directly beneath it, illuminated as they should have been, but something was off. 

Catching its reflection in my glass, on silver platters, and even in the shadow behind Spencer’s eye, I realized, the three of us were glowing, just like Astrid and Adam.

Saluting the bride and groom, Spencer’s fake smile splintered into something sour.

""Till death do us fuckin’ part, *bro*."" he said, his lips breaking out into a grin, but his eyes were dark. 

“Because that's what we are, right, Adam?” he laughed. “*Bro’s*?”

I wondered why *we* were the sudden main attraction when something... pricked in my gut.

I thought I had broken my glass. 

But looking down, I wasn’t even holding a glass of champagne. 

I had a vivid memory of placing it on the table when the ceremony began. 

Slowly, my thoughts began to swirl as several things registered at once, including the growing red stain seeping through my dress. It wasn’t a clean slice, but it was definitely a stab.

I didn’t feel pain at first, or maybe I did, and it just wasn’t fully hitting me yet. 

My body felt it, though, when I felt myself slump. 

I didn’t fall, not yet, but I slammed my hand over the intense red coming through my dress. I think I screamed or maybe I just made mouth noises.

When I looked up, whoever had stabbed me was gone. 

I thought I imagined it until my eyes found Spencer, his frenzied gaze glued to me, watching the rapidly growing bloodstain just above my abdomen.

Time seemed to slow down after that.

Two things triggered my fight-or-flight response:

A sudden shriek from the crowd.

A girl dropping dead. Then a guy.

Spencer’s eyes, that had been stuck to me, rolled into the back of his head.

“*Fuck*.” was all he managed to splutter, before beads of red escaped his mouth. 

I barely saw the shattered glass plunged through his skull. 

His body swayed back and forth, his attempts at breaths becoming weaker, before his lips formed a single word: 

*“Run.”*

When Spencer’s body hit the ground, I stumbled back, ready to run, ready to grab Astrid and run for my fucking life. 

Evie was covered in Spencer, her cheeks slick with his blood. 

I thought her mind was slow to come to terms with what was going on, but her smile seemed to grow.  

She took a dainty step away from Spencer’s body, while the  rest of the party, excluding the inner family, exploded into chaos around me. 

I don’t know how they were dying. They were just dropping like flies. 

So many of them. So many girls I’d mentally rolled my eyes at, and guy’s with square jaws I didn’t like from first glance. 

Evie’s smile faded when a masked figure stepped in front of her. 

I expected her to run, like I was supposed to but I couldn’t stop looking at Spencer’s body lying in a rapidly growing pool of crimson and brain matter. 

I could see pieces of his skull littering the ground. 

“Wait, no.” Evie stumbled back with a laugh. “I’m on the list.” She kicked Spencer's body. 

“As you can see, my family donated a hell of a lot of money for this.”

She turned her nose up at him, her lips curving in disgust. 

“Unlike *him*, who's daddy went *tragically* broke, I deserve to be a spectator.”

Adam surprised me with a laugh. 

It’s amazing how you can forget about your own life when the world is coming apart around you.

Astrid was gone, guests our own age were dropping dead, and Adam was smiling like a fucking psychopath.

“Your parents are yet to tell you, but *you’re* broke,” he said with a shrug. 

“Sorry, Evie.”

Something in the girl’s expression turned feral. “What? That’s not right!” 

She clawed at her hair, stumbling back.

“Wait—”

Before she could speak, she was shot in the head.

Just… shot straight through her skull. 

I saw her brains hit someone else's face. 

When Evie’s body joined Spencer’s, I remembered how to breathe. 

I started to back away, and broke into a run. 

Slipping on pooling red drenched in moonlight, I made for the flowery arches, before someone stepped on my dress, and I was violently yanked back. 

I screamed, ducking to try and wrench myself free. 

“Penn! it’s me!”

Astrid.

Standing illuminated in white light, my best friend with wide eyes.

“Are you… are you okay?” She grabbed me when I dropped to my knees.

“Am I okay?” I managed to choke out, and it became more of a hysterical laugh. “What the *fuck* do you think?”

Astrid wrapped her arms around me, and she smelled like flowers. “We’re getting out of here,” She hissed out. “Right now.”

“Right.” I groaned, biting against a cry. I had to staunch my wound as best as I could.

Her eyes went to the gate ahead of us. “That’s a mechanical lock. “So, we… we climb over, right?”

Screaming from behind me.

We didn’t have time to think about it. 

She reached out for my hand, tugging me into a staggered run. 

I was the first one trying to scale the gate, planting one heeled foot on the fence and grasping above. 

When I was halfway up, I twisted around to see if she was following, when something cold and cruel sliced into my spine. 

I felt it cutting right through skin and bone, penetrating me. 

The shock of it was enough to send me backwards, tumbling, before my head hit concrete with a meaty smack, stars dancing in my eyes. No, not stars. 

Astrid. 

Through feathered vision, I saw the two of them, their eloping hands, their kiss under a suddenly startlingly bright moon, as I slowly bled out. 

When Adam and Astrid were pulling away, a darkness I had never seen before swirling in my best friend’s eyes, she dropped down next to me. 

My blood was ruining her dress, painting her crimson. 

“Isn’t this… amazing?” She whispered, her voice drifting in and out. 

I was trying not to choke on my own blood, but her words stayed with me, cementing themselves into my mind.

“My first love is giving up her own life for me to be happy. You and me, Penn. Joined by the moon herself, granting us her light, and entangling our souls so we can be together… forever….”

…

3 years.

1095.73 days.

1,000+ deaths later.


---

“Penn?”

Astrid’s voice was in my mind, and I wasn’t sure how. With my face pressed against wet grass, I instantly knew my injuries.

Sprained wrist, a stab wound on my leg.

Those words meant nothing to me.

Where was my bed? My body was twisted like a pretzel.

“Penn!”

The voice became a screech.

“Get up! You have half a minute until respawn. Are you going to spend it waiting to die? Come on, get on your feet!”

What?

Opening my eyes, I saw the sun poking through the trees.

Trees, I thought dizzily.

Where the fuck *was* I?

“Astrid?”

Her name slipped from my mouth, and I blinked rapidly, frowning at the big, bright thing blinding me.

The sun.

It didn’t make sense where I was, surrounded by thick canopies of trees.

“They’re coming, Penn! Get up! Now!”

I did, somehow. But the pain flattened me against the dirt, a raw cry escaping my lips. 

My feet were bare, dirt gritted between my toes.

But her voice was right.

I could hear them coming through the trees, branches snapping under feet, which immediately sent me flying up despite my wounds.

My mind knew what to do. 

Ripping off a strip of my dress, my hands trembled as I did my best to fashion a bandage. 

“That’s it,” Astrid’s voice murmured. Her voice sounded wrong, melodic.

Singsong.

“What’s going on?” I spoke to thin air, to her voice in my head. “Where… am I?”

“A bad place,” Astrid whispered. “But don’t worry. You’re almost winning this time, I promise. I have 800 dollars on you.”

“Winning?”

I started to walk, stumbling over myself.

“There’s a river just down here,” she said. “You can clean your wounds. I don’t see anyone. I think they ran the other way.”

“Astrid.” I tripped over a rock. All around me… trees. I was in some kind of forest. “What the fuck is… happening?”

“Just keep going, Penn.”

“I was at your wedding,” I whispered, my hands inching down my blood-spattered dress. “And you…”

“You’re getting close.”

“Killed me.” The words wouldn’t fully register in my head. “You… killed me.”

I could see the river, which bled into the sky. 

My steps quickened as I stumbled toward the water. It wasn’t until I waded into the shallows that the memory crashed over me.

“You fucking killed me, you psycho bitch,” I whispered, my voice shaking. 

I rolled up the tattered remains of my dress, searching for the wound on my stomach—

But it was gone.

My breath hitched. 

“What did he do to you? Adam. What did that bastard do to your head?”

I swallowed hard, my chest tightening. “But if you… if you killed me, then how the hell am I here?”

“It’s not *bad*.” Astrid was talking about the gaping, ugly wound on my leg.

While my mind wasn’t sure how I’d gotten it, my body knew I’d been stabbed by some asshole hunting me down.

I was chasing after him, and he’d disappeared, only for something to hit me from behind. 

I dragged my fingers across the back of my head, wincing. I had a pretty bad gash in my scalp, but it wasn't fatal.

Yet.

If I didn't find a med kit, however, it would become fatal.

Astrid’s voice startled me again. “Penny, do you remember when we tried on dresses for homecoming in junior year, and you said I looked fat in the pink one?”

I couldn’t resist a laugh.

“I said you didn’t fit it because you *didn’t*,” I said through my teeth, tearing into my dress to make a second bandage, wrapping it around my fist.

“I never said you were fat. Your figure was better than mine.”

“Well, right now you also look like shit.” Astrid giggled. “So, I guess we’re equal!”

I slammed my hands into the filthy water, splashing loudly. “Equal?”

“Hey! You need to be quiet! Don’t draw attention to yourself!”

“Tell me what’s going on.” I spat, plopping myself down on a rock, examining my wounds. I was mostly okay, except a gash on my knee, and my leg injury. “Why am I here?”

She didn't respond.

“Astrid!”

“Well. There are two groups. The ones who went feral and Lord of the Flies, and the ones who actually play the game—""

She cut herself off. “Two o’clock, Penn.”

I twisted around, and she groaned.

“No, don’t move! Remember in freshman year when Jake Hollster was totally checking you out, and you looked directly at him? Don’t do that.”

“He wasn’t looking at me,” I gritted out, grabbing a rock for a weapon. “He was looking at *you*.”

“They’re armed, Penn. I’m going to need you to go slowly, okay?”

I shuffled back on my hands and knees. “Armed?”

“Looks like a gun. Wait. Get down!”

I did, throwing myself into murky water. 

Not deep enough to drown in, but just enough to hide me. 

I could hear footsteps.

They were slow and deliberate, crunching through pebbles before splashing into the shallows. 

The water was ice-cold, a relief against my body. I held my breath.

“Don’t… move.” Astrid murmured in my head.

I didn’t, but still felt the sudden sleek metal of a gun slide under my chin, forcing my head up. 

Before I found myself face staring down at the barrel pointed between my eyes. 

Evangeline. 

The girl was in tatters of her bridesmaid dress, barefoot, a scar sliced down her face. Her finger was steady on the trigger. 

Evie’s flower crown was still perched on her head, though her wildly vacant eyes no longer matched it.

“Wait.” I managed to hiss out.

Her body moved like a robot, reloading the gun and sticking it between my eyes.

“Evangeline.” I said her name, and only her name, through a sob before her mouth twisted into a bloody smile, and she pulled the trigger, blowing my head off.

I didn’t feel my death, but I did feel an unearthly presence floating around in the nether, yanking me back.

And for the 1,000th time, I could once again feel my body being slowly rewritten.

Not long after that, I awoke face down in the grass, the memory of the gun ricocheting in the girl’s hands sending me upright, grasping hold of my throat. 

“You’re so bad at this game, Penn. I’m bored.”

Astrid’s voice disappeared after that.

I called out to her, but I was alone.

Alone, in my bridesmaid dress, still stained crimson. 

A small handgun lay next to me, a box of ammo, and a bottle of water.

Slowly, I stood up. Before I glimpsed something glistening in the distance.

A wall. 

Sliced between the trees was a wall made of glass. 

I made my way over to it in slow stumbling steps. 

Behind it was Astrid, dressed in a flowing  red gown. 

She looked older. 

Older than me. I was still 20.

How *long* had I been twenty? 

Astrid was sipping champagne. Her eyes reminded me of Adam’s. 

“Thank you,” she said, as my fingers sliding across the barrier became fists, rage boiling my blood. I dropped onto my knees, screaming out for my best friend. 

“The lives of our first loves,” she said. 

“Every time you die, our marriage becomes more magical and it’s all thanks to you,” her smile widened when a feral screech rang from my throat. 

You bitch. 

I said it, screamed it, until my throat was raw. 

I barely realized I was crying, pounding my hands into the pane. 

Astrid stepped back, her lips curling. 

“Now you've done it! You've attracted the freaks.”

Behind me, sudden war-cries rang out, bare feet slapping through the dirt, heading toward me like a pack of wild animals.

A sharpened spear flew past me, hitting the tree behind me with a thunk. 

I twisted around to see the spear wielder.

Spencer, still in his wedding getup, a flower crown sitting on his head, along with what was left of an animal, no, *human* skull. 

His eyes were vacant pools of nothing staring back. When his head inclined, an animalistic snort escaping his lips, I started to run, stumbling over myself. 

Astrid’s voice rang in my head, a melodic murmur as I threw myself into a run. 

“Spencer Setori is the new favorite to win! Penn, if you kill him, baby, you've won!”

Louder, she screamed in my skull, as I tripped over uneven ground. 

I felt the weight of his body crashing into mine, knocking me onto my face. 

His warm breath tickling my neck, sharp incisors grazing my flesh. 

“Penn!” Astrid was laughing now, her voice dripping with excitement. But her voice was Adam’s. 

“Get him. Bleed him out and guzzle it down. I want to see you fuck him, then kill him. I’ve got eight hundred dollars on him actually waking up! Spencer Setori is trash. Did you know his daddy stole, like, millions from Adam’s family? Oh, and I haven't even told you the best part—”

Her manic screech, thankfully, began to fade when Spencer’s teeth gnawed into my head. 

I felt the boy chewing, savoring his meal, his mindless gnawing splintering through my skull, the weight of him pressing down, crushing my chest. 

A raw, animalistic screech tore from my throat. 

His slimy fingers flipped me onto my back, and through blurred vision, I caught a glimpse of his face, symbols etched into bare skin, smeared with scarlet. 

The remnants of his flower crown were tangled and threaded through the hollow, gnawing black eyes of a decaying skull nestling thick brown curls.

The last thing I heard, as Spencer Setori let out a happy chitter, was the sudden roar of laughter slamming into me.

Followed by loud applause. Whooping.

Her family has pushed me over the edge. I could tell you stories and show you horrible mold and mildew from their Brita pitcher, the dog's bowl, their old shower...

They recently moved from our city to the suburbs because they bought a house. The dog is kept in the mudroom 99.5% of the time. The other 0.5% of the time she is taken outside just long enough to empty herself and is brought back inside immediately. They don't play with her, they leave her alone for *hours* at a time. 

The mudroom is off the kitchen and cut off from the rest of the house, and because of the layout I cannot fit the air mattress on which I'm sleeping any closer. The dog hears me in other parts of the house and cries. I think it's worse when I'm here and she can hear me. I'm so distraught. I don't know what to do.

When I watched her in the old apartment she was allowed on the futon with me, I would take her on loooong walks, we'd just sit outside on nice days, etc. I'd take her to the gym, coffee shops. Now I can take her for walks but that's it. Being in the house is torture for both of us, and I'm coming off a week in a house with no air conditioning on 100° days.

They booked me for a few days two weeks from now and I think I'm going to tell them that, unless she can be in other parts of the house with me, even leashed, I cannot do this. This is horrific.

This dog is 12 years old. Maybe 13. She's not destructive. She's sweet and fun and just wants to be pet. 

My apartment is not pet friendly and I live quite far so I can't take her home with me or I would have already. Fuck. ",22,1751593167.0,petsitting,10,0.96,False
1lr6n8t,https://i.redd.it/ds5sxf4dhraf1.png,The Last Train of Happiness,"Chapter 1

Not long after we broke up, Liam Caillet found someone new.

Years later, we met again. I was a top influencer. He had acquired the MCN agency I signed with.

He blocked my collaborations, snatched away my brand deals, and shut down my livestream channel—all because his new girlfriend said, ""Her face bothers me. I don't like it.""

Well, I'm a cancer blogger. How good is someone supposed to look when they're dying?

\*\*\*

Right after the pre-Thanksgiving stream ended, my assistant, Alicia Hayes, came in with bad news.

""Gabriella! I'm so pissed. Mr. Caillet replaced you with Sandra on the ad contract again!""

My heart sank. I swallowed the pain, forced a smile, and tried to calm her. ""Let it go, Alicia.""

But she refused. ""Again? How many times now? Do you even want to live? So what if you dumped him first? He moved on right away anyway!""

I cleared my throat, lowering my voice, trying to stop her.

But she glared. ""No. I'm going to Liam's. I'll tell him you're—""

""Alicia, don't!"" I grabbed her hand. ""I'll talk to him myself. Okay?""

Just then, the executive assistant pushed open the livestream room door.

""Gabriella, Mr. Caillet wants to see you. Now.""

My heart jolted. It was the first time he called for me since acquiring this MCN agency.

Standing outside Liam's glass office, my hand froze mid-air, unable to knock.

Seeing his cold profile sent a chill through me. My heart trembled.

I forced myself to stay calm and knocked.

As I walked in, the first thing I saw was a framed photo on his desk—him and Sandra Sullivan at their college graduation.

The day I broke up with him, he accepted her confession. That day became their anniversary.

Just as my thoughts drifted, Liam slammed a file onto the desk.

""Take a look. Your account data. Five months straight, under 8,000 dollars. Give me a good reason.""

I glanced down. The bolded line at the bottom stabbed like a knife.

""Beauty Influencer, Gabriella Rochon. Followers, 1.32M. Streams, 52. Conversion rate, 3.2%. Recommendation, Terminate partnership.""

""Terminate partnership""—those words strangled me.

I struggled to breathe. My emotions spiked.

""Mr. Caillet, my traffic's been stable. Every stream pulls tens of thousands of viewers, but you cut off tipping and stopped giving me brand deals...""

""Gabriella."" Liam suddenly called my name, cold and sharp, cutting me off. He looked down at me like a king addressing a subject. ""So you're saying this is my fault?""

I froze, speechless.

""Isn't it?"" I thought.

Liam let out a cold laugh. ""Gabriella, you really think you're important enough for me to target?""

The words hit like a boomerang, punching a hole straight through my chest.

All the bitterness came rushing in, unstoppable...

Three years ago, I broke up with Liam.

That proud man, almost 1.9 meters tall, had bent down, begging me not to leave.

And I said, ""Liam, you think you're someone worth staying for?""

Honestly, from the moment I left him, I never thought about today.

""Starting today, we're taking back your account. Gabriella, your contract has been terminated.""

His voice was as cold as ice. He didn't even bother lifting his eyelids when he dropped the verdict.

My body stiffened. I could barely breathe.

""Liam, please... just give me a little more time. I'll prove my value. I can make money for you...""

The word ""money"" seemed to hit a nerve.

He let out a mocking snort, finally lifting his eyes to glance at me. ""Gabriella, you think I need your pocket change?""

He suddenly straightened, lips tight, eyes darkening with hatred.

""Gabriella, you know what? If I could buy a life with money, I'd spend it just to see you dead.""

Chapter 2

It felt like a bullet tore through my chest. The pain almost made me cry.

I knew he hated me. But I didn't think it ran this deep.

I couldn't blame him. I had pushed him into hell when he needed me most. Of course, he hated me.

Liam's father was a narcotics officer. His biggest dream was to wear his father's badge again.

At 18, he got into the police academy. But to save me, he fought with some thugs, got arrested, and ended up with a permanent stain on his record. Dream over.

At 22, he was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy. In and out of the ICU five times, six critical notices.

Before his surgery, he asked to see me one last time. I thought it was just another way to make me stay. So I told him, ""Liam, whether you live or die has nothing to do with me.""

Now, facing the disgust in his eyes, I clenched my teeth. I had no words left.

I owed him.

My dry eyes blinked hard. My voice dropped to barely a whisper. ""Let me finish this month. Please.""

I lowered my head, hoping this pathetic plea would move him.

In the end, all I got was...

""Get out. Five days. Don't show up again.""

Gripping the termination papers, I stiffly walked out of his office. The cold air conditioner wrapped around me like an icebox.

Suddenly, a wave of metallic heat rose in my throat.

I rushed into the break room, pulled out my cancer painkillers, and swallowed them with cold water.

After a long while, I leaned against the wall, barely holding on. Then I pulled out my phone, snapped a close-up of the termination papers, and posted it on my backup account.

""Day 1038 of fighting cancer. My beloved first love just fired me. Five days till unemployment.""

The truth is, I was diagnosed with hereditary bone cancer three years ago. My five-year survival rate was less than 20%.

The moment I posted it, my followers flooded the comments.

""Marmalade, you're the bravest cancer blogger I follow. Since you're unemployed now, just take a break and rest.""

""Fired by your first love? I thought you said he was just a broke college student?""

That comment hit me like a punch in the chest.

I used to think we were both poor. Until after we broke up when he got together with Sandra.

That night, fireworks lit up the whole city.

Everyone knew—the heir of the Caillet Group, Liam, was officially dating.

Later, I saw a screenshot posted on the campus confession wall—a chat between him and someone else.

The person asked why he pretended to be poor.

He replied, ""I used to fake being broke to keep gold diggers away. But I'm not worried anymore. The one who tried gave up on her own.""

Bitterness filled my mouth. My heart ached.

At some point, Alicia appeared. She patted me gently, worried. ""Gabriella, are you okay? You look pale. Should we go to the hospital?""

I forced a smile and shook my head. ""I'm fine. Just...""

I handed her the termination papers. ""Just... I won't be able to work with you anymore.""

Alicia snatched the papers, read them twice, and burst out in anger.

""Liam is a bastard! Who does this kind of petty revenge? Kicking you when you're down—he's not afraid of karma? Does he even realize cutting you off is basically killing you?""

Ignoring everything, Alicia grabbed my hand and dragged me out, heading straight for Liam's office. Suddenly, we stumbled into a noisy crowd.

Sandra stood there in a white dress, handing out wedding invitations and a bag of candy to everyone.

When she reached me, she smiled smugly. ""Gabriella, you have to come to witness our wedding! After all, you're the one who brought us together!""

Wedding?

Liam's getting married...

Chapter 3

My blood froze. My throat tightened.

I forced a smile, my voice hoarse. ""Then I wish you and Mr. Caillet a lifetime of happiness.""

The words scraped my chest as I took her wedding invitation and candy.

The next second, Liam appeared. He snatched it from my hand and tossed it straight into the trash.

Without even glancing at me, he grabbed Sandra's hand, interlacing their fingers.

""My wedding isn't open to just anyone.""

His words landed like a hammer on my chest. The office went dead silent. Everyone exchanged awkward glances. Alicia tried to step in, but I pressed her hand down.

I watched as Liam, hand in hand with Sandra, disappeared through the door. One by one, the others scattered.

When the noise faded, only Alicia and I were left.

I bent down and slowly picked the candies out of the trash, one piece after another.

Chocolate, strawberry, milk...

But not a single apple.

That year, at the top of the Ferris wheel, after kissing me, he said, ""From now on, I'll only eat apple candy.""

He didn't love me anymore. Not even a little.

A bitter smile tugged at my lips as tears fell, splattering on the candy.

I clenched the candy in my fist, pressing it against my chest, trying to hold back the pain ripping through me.

But it wouldn't stop.

Alicia pulled me into her arms and brought me back to my rented place near the cancer hospital.

When she brought me boiled eggs, I was writing ""Bet Agreement"" on a piece of paper.

Alicia frowned. ""Why are you writing this?""

I carefully folded the paper and smiled faintly. ""Even though Liam kicked me out, I want to give it one last shot. I want him to see my worth. That I can make him money.""

Alicia stared at me in disbelief. ""How?""

""By doing battles. I'll top the gift rankings.""

I had prepared so many ways to convince Liam, yet none of them were needed.

After reading my bet agreement, he only said one thing, ""If you don't know how to give up, I don't mind teaching you.""

His eyes were sharp enough to pierce through me. I could only smile bitterly.

""What are you smiling at?"" His voice was full of hate.

I just remembered the time he taught me how to ride a bike—his tone was exactly the same.

The memory stabbed my bones, but all I said was, ""Thank you, Mr. Caillet, for giving me this chance.""

\*\*\*

That night's stream, I was ready to go all in.

No filters. Harsh lighting. Bare face. Full-on clickbait.

The moment I went live, I shot straight to the top of trending.

""Beauty Guru Gabriella Goes Filter-Free—AI-Level Queen Stuns the World!""

I thought Liam would pit me against some big influencer or A-list celeb.

I never expected it to be Sandra.

No time to be shocked. I snapped into host mode, greeting the hundreds of thousands flooding into my stream.

As I applied intricate designs on my face with my makeup tools, my ranking on the gift leaderboard soared—straight to an overwhelming first place!

Meanwhile, Sandra's stream struggled—barely 10K viewers.

There was no doubt. I was going to win.

Even the chat was telling me to go easy on the rookie.

But then, in the final 30 seconds, Liam suddenly dropped into Sandra's stream—blasting 999 rockets at once!

My hand shook, the eyeliner pen slipping—red ink staining the white of my eye.

In a blink, Sandra shot past me on the leaderboard.

The results flipped instantly. I lost to her by a thousand points.

Sandra smiled, calm and smug.

Following the rules, she randomly picked a punishment from the comments. ""Since you lost, Gabriella, your punishment is to kiss the control guy for three seconds!""

The poor tech intern—a fresh-faced guy—blushed as he was pushed in front of the camera. I could hear his heart pounding from a few meters away.

He avoided my gaze, clearly flustered. I couldn't help but tease, ""Got a girlfriend?""

He froze, then shook his head fast. ""No... never even dated.""

This would be his first kiss.

I looked at him, a little guilty. Part of me wanted to just give up.

What did it matter? I had already lost my job.

I didn't want to drag an innocent kid into this.

I glanced up at him, apologetic. ""Sorry, I—""

Before I could finish, the intern suddenly grabbed my waist, leaned in, and kissed me—warm breath brushing against my lips.

The comments instantly exploded.

""OMG! Queen and young boy! This is so sweet!""

""I'm jealous of the intern! I'd trade my whole life to kiss a queen like her!""

Then—BANG! The studio door flew open.

In the middle of the frenzy, Liam stormed in, face like a thundercloud. Without a word, he grabbed my wrist and dragged me out!

Chapter 4

Liam yanked me straight out of the studio.

He sneered, his cold eyes stabbing into me.

""Gabriella, Andy is my cousin. You? Kiss him? You think you're worthy?""

His words nearly tore my heart apart.

The moment our eyes met, his hatred almost crushed me.

I rubbed my wrist, red from his grip, blinking back the sting in my eyes. ""Sorry. I didn't know who he was. I was just playing by the rules.""

Right then, a tall figure stepped in front of me, blocking him. Andy Caillet squared up to him.

""Whether she's worthy or not, I'll decide. Don't touch her, Liam.""

I froze, staring at Andy's back. My gaze slid past his shoulder—Liam's eyes locked on me, the chill in the stabbing straight into my heart.

""Andy, what do you even see in her? Greed? Schemes?""

Andy shot back, voice tense. ""So what, Liam? You got hurt once, and now you see ghosts everywhere?

""And stop harping on profit. The Caillet family's loaded—we couldn't spend it all in ten lifetimes.""

With that, he grabbed my hand and brushed past Liam.

Out of the corner of my eye, I thought I saw his face stiffen.

Once we were outside, Andy let go of my hand and, feeling apologetic, tried to explain.

""Gabriella, Liam lost control because he once pretended to be poor, dated a scholarship girl, and got burned. Don't take his words to heart.""

""Yeah."" I forced a small smile, pretending I was fine. I didn't tell him—I was that scholarship girl.

Thinking I didn't believe him, Andy continued softly, ""Liam was crazy about her. He even tattooed her name over his heart. Later, he had surgery to get the skin replaced.""

""He thinks she's disgusting. I think she's bad luck too."" His gaze burned into me. ""But you're different—""

Pain surged in my chest, unstoppable.

The tattoo on my right atrium with Liam's name seemed to ache too.

Peeling skin, carving flesh. It must've hurt like hell back then.

I swallowed my tears and cut Andy off.

""Thanks for helping me out today. Colleagues, after all.""

That one word, ""colleague,"" choked whatever he was about to say. His eyes, bright a second ago, dimmed instantly.

I turned and left him standing there.

By the time I packed my stuff and went to HR to process my resignation, the HR rep threw a voluntary resignation form at me with a cold face.

""Mr. Caillet agreed to terminate your contract at the end of this month. If you leave now, it's voluntary. No severance.""

My mind went blank. I couldn't afford to lose that money. Treatments, and meds—they expensive. I couldn't touch my savings either.

I changed my mind on the spot. ""I'll finish out the month.""

Only four days left. I couldn't afford to be stupid about money.

The HR woman sneered, glanced at the coffee nearby, then ordered, ""This is for Ms. Sullivan. Mr. Caillet ordered it. Since you've got nothing to do, deliver it.""

On the coffee bag was Liam's handwritten note.

""Less ice, less sugar. Cut back on coffee, sleep more.""

The words were warm. Once, that warmth was mine too.

I grabbed the coffee and headed to Sandra's office.

As I walked, old memories crept back.

I remembered his phone, packed with notes about my favorite things.

""Gabriella likes watermelon and hates vinegar. Loves strawberries, but not strawberry-flavored candy...""

A mix of sadness and bitterness welled up inside me.

Did he take notes on Sandra's likes too? Did he brew hot tea for her during her period? Massage her stomach? Did he hold her and sing to her when she was down?

Then I felt stupid.

She was his fiancée. The one he chose to spend his life with. Of course, he did. Probably gave her even more.

My eyes stung.

I shook off the discomfort, knocked on her door, and walked inside.

""Ms. Sullivan, your coffee, from Mr. Caillet.""

She reached out, then suddenly froze. Her sharp gaze locked onto my slightly open collar.

I looked down, following her eyes—there it was. The tattooed Liam on my chest.

Chapter 5

I instinctively tried to pull my collar up, but Sandra yanked my hand. ""Gabriella, showing off your tattoo so Liam can see it, huh?""

I wanted to deny it, but she didn't care and continued, ""You think flashing that tattoo will make him fall for you again? Or maybe let you stay in the company?""

My throat tightened.

""I never thought that. No need to be so aggressive.""

""Thought? Do you think you're even worth it? You wish!"" She sneered, her voice sharp. ""Liam told me—being with you back then was just practice. Don't flatter yourself as some hard-to-get first love.""

The smile vanished. Her eyes turned venomous, cold like a snake.

""Don't believe me? Try it.""

I didn't want to try. I didn't want to fight. I just wanted to finish my last four days quietly and leave with my money.

I shook off her hand, set down the coffee, and turned to leave.

But then, Sandra grabbed the coffee and flipped it over my head. The cold brown liquid drenched me from head to toe.

It was 2 AM, and I was grinding to finish my quarterly financial report—a soul-crushing, 30-page monstrosity. My brain was fried, my coffee was cold, and my will to live was dangling by a thread. To cope, I’d been swapping between my work folder and a folder of absurd memes my friend had sent me earlier. (Pro tip: Never mix business and meme-tainment.)

Finally, I finished the report. With the confidence of a man who’s definitely double-checked his attachments, I slammed “Send” on the email to my boss, cc’ing the entire finance team. Then I passed out face-first on my keyboard.

I woke up to a Slack explosion. My heart dropped when I saw the preview: *""Per your attached analysis…""* followed by *12 laughing emojis* from my coworker. I opened the sent email.

Instead of *Q3\_Financials\_FINAL\_v2\_ACTUALFINAL.docx*, I’d attached a screenshot of *Shrek* with the caption: **""That’ll do, donkey. That’ll do.""**

Silence. Then my boss replied:  
*""Creative approach to EBITDA. Approved.""*

1lr6g7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/fiction/comments/1lr6g7m/book/,Book,"Chapter 1: The Weight of Contradiction
Atlas Thorne found himself leaning back in a worn coffee shop chair, the humid Georgia air a familiar weight. Across from him, a visiting astrophysicist, a man with tired eyes and the subtle aura of profound intellect, was listening intently. Atlas hadn't set out to challenge the man's worldview, but the conversation had drifted, as his always did, to the foundational inconsistencies that pricked at his mind.
""It's fascinating, isn't it?"" Atlas began, his voice calm, almost detached, yet resonating with an undercurrent of conviction. ""How billions of people stake their entire existence on a singular truth, a unique path to the divine, when the most overwhelming factor determining that truth for them is utterly arbitrary: the coordinates of their birth and the beliefs of their parents. A child born in Mecca is rarely a devout Buddhist, and one in Tibet rarely a fervent Christian. The claim to absolute, universal truth seems to evaporate under the weight of geographical probability. The sheer audacity of such an assertion, when compared with the simple data of human demographics, is a contradiction I cannot reconcile.""
He paused, letting the silence hang, not out of aggression, but genuine curiosity as to how the other man would grapple with the logical paradox. He continued, ""And yet, societies are built upon these very assertions, forming moral codes, cultural norms, even laws. Entire conflicts have been fought over these 'truths.' It's a grand, self-perpetuating system of inherited conviction, rarely interrogated, purely for the sake of maintaining a perceived order. It’s like a colossal, elaborate game of 'King of the Hill,' but the hill's existence is entirely predicated on a narrative that shifts with every border.""
The astrophysicist, a man accustomed to the cold, hard logic of the cosmos, absorbed this. He had spent his life exploring universal laws, where contradictions led to new discoveries, not unwavering dogma. He recognized the rigorous, almost painful, intellectual honesty in Atlas’s observation, a mind that simply refused to let a logical inconsistency slide. ""One of the most interesting conversations I've had in years,"" the older man finally conceded, a weariness in his voice that spoke of countless unstimulating dialogues.
That sentiment—the almost ecstatic resonance of a mind finally encountering its match—was a rare beacon in Atlas Thorne's otherwise isolated existence. At twenty-five, he moved through the world with an effortless grace, his imposing height and lean, athletic frame drawing quiet attention, but his true distinctiveness lay within. He saw patterns and contradictions with a clarity that was both a gift and a curse, and the world's myriad inconsistencies chafed at him like an ill-fitting suit. He had left formal schooling behind after sixth grade, bored by its slow pace, yet his mind had devoured knowledge independently, forging connections most never even glimpsed.
The issues of the world weren't abstract for Atlas; they were personal affronts. Why did people cling to beliefs that crumbled under simple logic? Why did flawed systems persist when efficient alternatives were so obvious? This constant, irritating friction against his sharp mind left him perpetually frustrated, feeling like an anthropologist studying a species bound by self-imposed illogic.
His personal life, despite an abundance of attention, was a landscape of profound loneliness. Having grown up poor until the age of eighteen, Atlas had navigated scarcity before ever knowing privilege. From seventeen, when he'd moved out of his mother's small apartment, living rent and bill-free had become almost automatic. Women were drawn to him with an undeniable magnetism, a mix of raw attraction and a seemingly primal urge to nurture his compelling presence. He learned to manage this dynamic with a precise, almost unconscious manipulation. A quiet compliment, a moment of carefully perceived vulnerability, and offers of support would materialize. It wasn't malicious; it was merely the pragmatic application of observed human desires, a survival skill honed by sharp observation.
He had initially harbored a genuine desire for real love connections, a bond that went deeper than the surface. But as the years wore on, he confronted a painful truth: they couldn't truly love him if they didn't understand him. And understanding, in Atlas’s world, was a rare commodity. He’d try to share his unique perspectives, to dissect the world's illogical constructs, or to point out the inconsistencies in their own thinking. When their minds couldn’t follow, when they remained locked in their predictable patterns, a profound frustration would boil over. Arguments erupted, often devolving into him yelling or berating them. It wasn't malice, but a desperate, subconscious disdain for the limitations he constantly encountered. He despised the fact that he felt so alone, even as people professed love for him, a love he knew was based on an incomplete, surface-level appreciation of who he truly was.

His most intense personal pursuit, however, was basketball. He'd never played organized ball growing up, only pickup games at parks and rec centers. But at twenty-one, a random tryout, driven by a sudden, intense obsession to take the sport seriously, unexpectedly landed him a short professional stint in Porto, Portugal. He had no formal coaching since, yet his relentless self-taught practices, fueled by the unique power of his Maladaptive Daydreaming, combined with his natural physical gifts, propelled him forward. He now moved within high-level basketball circles, respected by many B-level players, some A-level, and even a few NBA names. He hadn't yet played a full season at the highest levels, but that, he knew, was only a matter of time.

Chapter 2: The Internal Forge
The true expanse of Atlas’s unique mind unfurled in the quiet moments of his day, within the vivid, intricate daydreams that consumed a significant portion of his waking hours. These weren’t ordinary fantasies; they were fully realized simulations, elaborate scenarios where he could test hypotheses, strategize, and play out countless possibilities without real-world consequence.
He saw the world as a complex, often flawed system, and his daydreams were his personal ""white room"" for understanding its inner mechanics. Social interactions were meticulously rehearsed, potential conflicts analyzed from multiple angles, and long-term plans meticulously crafted in the theatre of his mind. He could embody different personas, anticipate reactions, and fine-tune his approach with a precision impossible in real-time.
This internal world also served as a critical training ground for his physical skills. Though he hadn't pursued basketball professionally with single-minded dedication from a young age, the innate talent was undeniable. In his daydreams, he could run drills, execute complex maneuvers, and even invent new techniques with a clarity that bordered on actual physical practice. From seventh grade through high school, while navigating online schooling that took an extra year due to his Maladaptive Daydreaming being more descriptive than goal-oriented at that age, he was building muscle memory and neural pathways in the abstract, honing skills without ever stepping onto a court. It was a period where his internal world was intensely vivid, yet less channeled into external productivity, explaining the extended time to graduate.
It was during these intense mental immersions that the world's problems felt most acutely personal. He could simulate the cascading effects of a geopolitical crisis, the systemic failures that led to social inequality, the logical contradictions at the heart of ideological conflicts. Within his mind, he could often devise elegant, ruthlessly efficient solutions, only to be pulled back to a reality where inertia, emotional reasoning, and entrenched interests seemed to render any meaningful change impossible.
This profound disconnect was the source of his persistent frustration. He saw the flaws in the system with stark clarity, possessed the intellectual tools to analyze them, and could even envision precise solutions. Yet, the vast majority of people around him seemed content to operate within the flawed framework, oblivious or apathetic to the underlying contradictions, leaving Atlas feeling profoundly alone in his perception.

Chapter 3: The Edge of Understanding
The brief, resonant conversations with individuals like the astrophysicist were vital. They confirmed Atlas's perceptions weren't entirely isolated, that others, though few, saw the world with a similar clarity, unburdened by conventional thinking. Yet, these connections were fleeting, like ships passing in the night. His daily interactions remained mired in the predictable and the shallow.
The women who sought him operated on a different plane. Their attraction was potent, an almost primal urge to nurture and shelter his imposing yet subtly complex presence. He’d learned to navigate this dynamic with a detached efficiency, providing just enough emotional validation to maintain the flow of support. But the constant frustration of not being truly seen or understood beneath the surface led to the arguments, the harsh words born of a desperate desire for genuine intellectual engagement that was never met. This cycle fueled his internal bitterness, a deep resentment towards the very people who claimed to care for him, yet failed to grasp his essence, leaving him feeling profoundly alone.
Atlas often felt like an anthropologist observing a species he fundamentally understood on an intellectual level, but rarely on an emotional one. He moved among them, understanding their motivations, their weaknesses, and their desires, but without the shared emotional landscape that would allow for true connection. The world's issues felt deeply personal precisely because he could see the underlying mechanisms with such clarity. The widespread apathy or misguided attempts at solutions felt like a personal affront to his intelligence. He was an anomaly, a powerful shadow in a world content with its own dim light, forever searching for an echo of genuine understanding in the vast, often frustrating, landscape of humanity.
But what happens when a mind so uniquely attuned to the world's flaws decides it's no longer content to merely observe? What happens when the architect of private simulations chooses to build in the chaotic, unforgiving world outside?


The Anomaly of Atlas
Chapter 4: The Unbearable Weight of Knowing
Atlas’s twenty-fifth year was not merely a turning point; it felt like a culmination, a slow, agonizing tightening of a coil wound since his youth. The jadedness he now carried wasn't a sudden onset. It was the residue of years spent peeling back layers of comforting illusion, from the simplistic tenets of inherited faith to the grand, self-serving narratives of society itself. He had once believed in it all—the Western ideals, the promises of equality, the comforting certainties of Christianity. But the cognitive dissonance had begun to prick at him relentlessly around sixteen, an unbearable itch his mind, incapable of ignoring contradiction, was compelled to scratch.
He remembered pouring over dusty library books, then later, endless online articles and academic papers, his intellect ravenous for patterns, for truth. Each discovery, each logical fallacy exposed, each hypocrisy laid bare, chipped away at the world he thought he knew. By twenty-five, he was profoundly changed, almost unrecognizable to the boy who had once believed. He saw now that the truths of the world were immutable and often brutal, and that most people willfully ignored them to stay sane. But Atlas was cursed with enlightenment and awareness, an unwanted clarity that haunted his soul. It stripped him of the comforting illusions, leaving him feeling less like a human and more like an alien observing Earth from a telescope, or worse, an alien trapped within a human body suit, unable to truly connect with the species he walked among.
This profound isolation wasn't merely social; it was existential. The constant frustration of un-shared understanding festered, turning the polite smiles and fleeting fascinations of others into further confirmation of his unique and isolating burden. He was respected for his basketball skills, sought after by women, but the genuine resonance he craved remained elusive. He was a phenomenon, but not a person, in their eyes. This was the true source of his burgeoning bitterness, a quiet, growing resentment towards a world that demanded his utility but offered no true belonging. If he was to be seen merely as a tool, then perhaps he would become the most efficient tool possible, wielded only for his own design.

Chapter 5: The Architect's Gaze
The internal white room of his mind, once a mere escape, had become a forge. It was here, in this boundless mental space, that Atlas began to shift from observation to intervention. The question that closed his previous reflections—what happens when the architect of private simulations chooses to build in the chaotic, unforgiving world outside?—was no longer theoretical. It was a blueprint.
His time on the basketball court, the hours spent in the mental rehearsal of complex plays and innovative moves, had sharpened his strategic mind beyond the game. He saw the court as a microcosm of human systems, players as variables, and the game itself as a conflict to be won through superior planning and execution. His Maladaptive Daydreaming, once a descriptive, consuming force that prolonged his online schooling, was now a disciplined, precise instrument. He could envision an opponent's every counter, map out the flow of a social gathering to identify key influencers, or simulate a crucial conversation, mentally drilling until the desired outcome became not just probable, but inevitable.
The allure of power, always present, began to crystallize into a definitive purpose. He understood manipulation not as a moral failing, but as a fundamental lever of human interaction. The ease with which he’d navigated life, secured resources, and garnered affections since seventeen was proof. The casual offers of rent-free living, the free cars from ex-girlfriends—they weren’t random acts of kindness. They were the predictable results of a carefully managed projection, a subtle tug on the strings of human desire and the inherent vulnerability of those who genuinely sought connection. He had mastered this.
His ambition, once a quiet inner flame, began to demand outward expression. The lingering anxiety, the last hurdle he’d identified, wasn’t a weakness to be purged, but a final piece of internal wiring to be re-calibrated. It was the last vestige of the boy who had once believed in external validation, in the world’s inherent fairness. To become truly unstoppable, he had to shed the last emotional chains that bound him to conventional human sentiment, including the bitter sting of feeling misunderstood.
The game was changing. His exasperation with humanity’s illogical adherence to comforting lies wasn't diminishing; it was intensifying, hardening into conviction. He had diagnosed the illness; now, he felt the imperative to apply the cure, even if the world resisted. The question was no longer whether he should engage, but how to do so with maximum efficiency and minimal emotional cost.

Chapter 6: The First Move
The decision came, not as a sudden revelation, but as the inevitable conclusion of years of internal calculations. He would stop merely observing the planet from his alien perspective. He would descend.
His phone buzzed. An invitation for a high-stakes, off-season pickup game, featuring a mix of current NBA talent and international stars, had landed in his inbox—the kind of gathering where reputations were forged and connections made that could catapult a career. For Atlas, it was more than basketball. It was a testing ground. A laboratory.
He replied with a concise, almost bland acceptance. As he sent it, a faint, almost imperceptible smile touched his lips. The game was no longer confined to his white room. The real world was about to become his next, most intricate simulation. And this time, the consequences would be very real for everyone else playing",1,1751592510.0,fiction,0,1.0,False

1lr6fkf,https://www.reddit.com/r/fictionalpsychology/comments/1lr6fkf/book/,Book,"Chapter 1: The Weight of Contradiction
Atlas Thorne found himself leaning back in a worn coffee shop chair, the humid Georgia air a familiar weight. Across from him, a visiting astrophysicist, a man with tired eyes and the subtle aura of profound intellect, was listening intently. Atlas hadn't set out to challenge the man's worldview, but the conversation had drifted, as his always did, to the foundational inconsistencies that pricked at his mind.
""It's fascinating, isn't it?"" Atlas began, his voice calm, almost detached, yet resonating with an undercurrent of conviction. ""How billions of people stake their entire existence on a singular truth, a unique path to the divine, when the most overwhelming factor determining that truth for them is utterly arbitrary: the coordinates of their birth and the beliefs of their parents. A child born in Mecca is rarely a devout Buddhist, and one in Tibet rarely a fervent Christian. The claim to absolute, universal truth seems to evaporate under the weight of geographical probability. The sheer audacity of such an assertion, when compared with the simple data of human demographics, is a contradiction I cannot reconcile.""
He paused, letting the silence hang, not out of aggression, but genuine curiosity as to how the other man would grapple with the logical paradox. He continued, ""And yet, societies are built upon these very assertions, forming moral codes, cultural norms, even laws. Entire conflicts have been fought over these 'truths.' It's a grand, self-perpetuating system of inherited conviction, rarely interrogated, purely for the sake of maintaining a perceived order.

This morning, she texted saying she’s free tomorrow evening or on the weekend and asked about my plans. I said I’m free all weekend and that my only plans are seeing her tomorrow night. I gave her two options: fireworks or quiet dinner downtown.

A few hours later, she replied:
“Ah so sorry can we meet at the weekend? A coffee one afternoon on Saturday or Sunday? I think I’ve overpacked my day tomorrow and quite jet lagged so my bedtime is early for the next couple of days 🙃”

I’m kind of deflated, I had no other plans, and I was genuinely looking forward to it. More importantly: Was this just bad timing, or is this her way of gently letting me down?

For context: I’m looking for something casual and I’m a virgin. Any advice or honest takes are appreciated.",1,1751592210.0,Advice,38,0.67,False

I was curious if anyone had any insight into why or how this happened, I spoke to my chef and he said it have something to with the way the milk is pasteurised, since the milk is pasteurised at low temp it maintains more enzymes that naturally break lactose down.",2,1751592205.0,Milk,5,1.0,False

I found her attractive, we talked, I asked for her number, and after a week of texting, I invited her out for coffee, saying I’d really like to get to know her better.

She responded positively but was about to leave for a 3-week trip. She said we could meet the next day for a quick coffee if I was free (I wasn’t in town). While she was traveling, we talked every few days and she’d reply with how her trip was going.

I stopped at my usual coffee spot before work, nothing fancy just a small local place with a chill vibe. I ordered my usual: iced oat milk latte, half sweet. The barista, who knows me by now, nodded and started making it.

As I’m waiting, this random woman behind me leans over and goes, “Oh honey, you don’t want that. The oat milk here is disgusting. You should get almond milk instead, trust me.”

I smiled politely and said, “Thanks, but I like oat milk.”

She rolled her eyes and actually called out to the barista like she was in charge: “Can you switch that to almond milk for her?”

The barista just blinked and went, “Uhh… she asked for oat milk.”

And then she had the nerve to say, “Well, she clearly doesn’t know better.”

I was like, “Ma’am, it’s my coffee.”

She huffed and mumbled something under her breath, then gave me dirty looks until I left. I was honestly too stunned to even clap back properly. Who even does that?

I still got my oat milk latte, and it was delicious. Sorry not sorry.
