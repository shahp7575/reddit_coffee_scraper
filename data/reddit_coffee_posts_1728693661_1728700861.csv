","(Hello, today I come to present to you the story of Edward and Erin. But it is a REMAKE. With new details and now that I have improved my writing a bit. I hope you like it. 


Yes, I know. Long stories don't usually work here. But I wanted this story better.)

**Out of Continuity: Lair of the Society**

The basement/clinic was completely silent, only disturbed by the occasional beeping of one of the Medical Teams. Suddenly the 5 members of the society entered, all carrying Erin, who was in a very weak state of health, black marks came out of her mouth, and spread across her skin.

Elizabeth: Let's put her on the stretcher, carefully... 

They placed her on her bed, while they hooked her up to monitors to view her vital signs. Which were at worryingly low levels. The 5 members left all their keys on top of Edward's desk. Next to a small black device similar to a wristwatch.

Eechiro: Where the hell did one of the legionaries come from? 

Eric: No idea, she took advantage of the fact that we were distracted by the mobsters and appeared from behind. 

Elizabeth: We have more important issues right now. Her signs are stable but they are declining at a worrying speed, we have to find a way to cure her...

Edward moves away a little to lean against one of the laboratory counters. His mind was still racing, Erin's voice began to hit his psyche. Repeating her name over and over again. Until his mind decided to take him to THAT night. He could feel like Erin was hugging him...

""P-please... help me…""

His pupils shrank, turning into small black dots. His arms had the reflex of trying to hug the air in front of him. The only thing that could bring him back to reality was Eechiro's clicking noises. Which was in front of him, trying to get his attention, while he repeated his name.

“Edward! Edward! Richter!” Eechiro gave up and returned to the rest of the society, who were surrounding Erin “Nothing! He's in Shock, I can't get him out of there!""

Edelgard: “Leave him, we have to do something soon! If we don't find a way to cure her, she's going to *die*""

Those last words gave Edward chills, but also the boost he needed to start moving. Without saying a single word, he approached his desk and took 5 keys next to the strange clock. After this, he began to leave the basement. While he put the watch on his wrist.

“*Sigh* Okay, we need a plan to confront the detective and get into that base. Any ideas, Edward...?” Eric noticed that Edward was leaving the basement, and after a quick glance he also saw that he had taken the keys. ""Damn! Stop him!""

The four members of the society followed Edward who walked determinedly towards the door to leave the House. Just a few meters away, Elizabeth and Eechiro began to pull his arms. While Edelgard held him by the back of the neck.

Eechiro: “You're not getting away that easy! 

Edward quickly crouched and performed a roundhouse kick to knock down the three who were trying to pin him down. Eric placed himself between Edward and the door to prevent him from leaving.

Eric: “Edward, No! We need a plan!"" He said as he held on to the door frame to prevent Edward from pushing him.

“ROBBINSON, I KNOW YOU HAVE GOOD INTENTION. BUT I ASK YOU TO GET OUT OF THE WAY” Edward said as he looked at the floor. Eric remained immovable in place.

“I can't do that Edward, I know you're angry. But going like this is…” Eric’s words faltered as Edward placed a firm hand on his shoulder, locking eyes with him. Eric stared into the forensic examiner’s eyes—not with anger, but with a mixture of fear and resolve. For the first time, Edward's expression broke through its usual indifference, revealing deep concern. That look was all Eric needed to make his decision. He stepped aside, allowing Edward to pass. Edward gave him a single nod before heading out the door. As soon as Elizabeth, Edelgard, and Eechiro stood up, they went straight to confront Eric.

Eechiro: “""What the hell was that? Have you gone crazy!? You let him leave with all the keys!"" 

Elizabeth: “He didn't take all… he lefts Erin's key. Although Eechiro is right, what were you thinking? Did you let him go alone to face an army?""

Eric: “You didn't see it… that look was relentless. I'm afraid of what will happen...""

Edelgard: “If you were afraid, why did you let him go?”

Eric: “I'm not worried about Edward... I'm worried about anyone who tries to stop him. But that’s not our main concern right now. We need to focus on keeping her alive. Come on, let's move!”

**Universe 18-24-53: Lair of the Steelwater.**

Edward arrived at the outskirts of a bar, from outside he could see multiple men sitting at the tables. Most of them had baseball bats or brass knuckles. At the centre table there were four men playing poker. After a few seconds of thinking, he decided to go inside.

“Look and cry gentlemen, I have Full House,” said a man as he slammed the table hard. Another responded to him, as he revealed his cards, “Very interesting, but…”

""What!? An R-Royal straight!? “That's impossible, you bastard,” said the first, while he looked at his partner's letters in astonishment. The lucky gangster was about to say something, until suddenly, Edward grabbed his sleeve, causing multiple hidden cards to fall out.

The gangster was surprised by the presence of Edward standing next to them. ""Where the hell did it come from?"" Wait… you cheated!?” The gangster replied, now addressing his partner.

“O-Of course not… and also who the hell is this blue-haired?” Said the other man who was still sitting. A dead silence was maintained until multiple glasses were heard breaking. When Edward turned around he saw a man at another table, with the bat in his hand. He had dropped his beer on the floor in shock. “Idiots! That blue-haired is one of those multiverse travellers! The Forensic Killer! You let the enemy in!

""What!?"" The Full House man lunged at Edward, who simply dodged him. Placing his leg to cause the gangster to fall to the ground, the man's forehead collided with one of the wooden chairs. The other men launched themselves at Edward, who limited himself to Dodge, and responded to them with the furniture of the place. He attacked them with chairs, plates. Even with the same poker cards. “Why don't you die!?” It was probably the phrase that was repeated the most in that fight.

When there were only two men left, they both decided to distance themselves from Edward, and tried to go to the back of the bar. Quickly, Edward took out a pair of sharp metal scissors from his pocket and threw them hard, aiming for the head of one of the men. Which remained nailed to the wall next to the door, while his companion managed to escape. Edward followed at a fast pace, but without running, maintaining unwavering composure. Which only generated more fear in the man who ran.

Edward followed the man to some underground warehouses. The contrast with the bar was clear, while the first looked like a stereotypical 80s movie, this was more like an apocalypse bunker. The man continued running down the long hallway, until he reached a huge room at the end. Due to the distance he had managed to get from the coroner. He had time to activate the Security system. Edward saw three huge metal doors close between him and the man. At this, Edward said nothing. He just approached and tapped the metal plate in front of him, after which he took out of his pocket one of the keys that he had taken from the base. It had a drawing of a dragon. And small burn marks. Edward took the key and inserted it into a small slot in the device on his wrist, suddenly a flash of orange light invaded the tunnel…

On the other side of the door the Gangster is celebrating — “Let's see how you get through that, Four Eyes!” Until he felt 2 presence behind him “What the hell are you doing?” The man turned around to see his boss, a man in a beige suit, with his hair combed back with gel. Next to him was a woman with red hair and green eyes. She dressed in a black trench coat, shirt and black pants.

""Boss! Miss Octavia! “Is the killer, he is here, and he eliminated everyone in the bar!” The man said as his legs trembled. The boss hardly flinched. While the woman only managed to murmur a phrase, “I was already wondering when we would see each other again, Edward.”

The man guided his boss and the redhead to a screen, which showed the security camera in the hallway. “You don't need to worry anyway, there are three metal doors between him and us. Look… there is no way he can pass- WHAT?”

The three of them were stunned. The metal on the doors was melting. Edward, dressed in a black and orange kimono, shooting a burst of fire. Making a circle to melt the door. The boss rushed towards his minion, holding him by the shoulders. “You told me he was the coroner, not the fire master!”

“He's the coroner, I don't have the slightest idea how he's throwing fire.” The boss released his minion and approached the redhead. “Listen to me, Octavia. You told me that if he eliminated one of those crazy people, The Guardians would fulfil a wish of mine. But you didn't tell me that they would come to try to destroy me.” The woman broke her silence and said, “Calm down, Tragliatore, our pact still stands. The guardians will fulfil your greatest wish. You have my word as a Detective.” The redhead said as she put her hand on his shoulder.

""Boss! He already went through 2 of the doors! Look” The henchman shouted at his boss, while he pointed at the door that was turning increasingly reddish. The boss removed Octavia's hand from his shoulder. “Quickly, you lazy bunch, everyone pointing at the door.” all the soldiers pointed directly towards the door. “I want anyone who walks through that door with more holes than a damn sieve.”

Multiple men stood at a safe distance from the melting door. Everyone was waiting for what was about to happen. The sound of the flame on the other side of the door invaded the environment, until suddenly... Ceased. Causing chills to almost all the people present there. A yellow glow could be seen from under the door that was melting…

The silence was interrupted by the sudden ejection of the door, which was thrown directly towards the soldiers in front. A large amount of smoke came out of the hole that was left. And a couple of yellow dots lit up. Edward ran out of the smoke, wearing a black trench coat, the inside of which shone bright yellow. In his face there was a pair of Goggles, also yellow, which emitted an intense light.

""There is! Shoot him!” Tragliatore shouted loudly, at the same time that Octavia dragged him towards a door to get him away from the shooting. The henchmen fired volleys of bullets at Edward, who was blocking the shots with Edelgard's trench coat.

Edward tackled one of the men and took cover behind some wooden boxes. He took the gun from his anklet, knocked out the guard next to him and took his gun from him. To start responding to shots. Taking advantage of the lens aiming system. After several minutes, Edward realized that he needed to increase speed... He removed the key that was inserted into the device. Which had the symbol of a Sniper sight, I inserted another one that had the symbol of skates.

After this, he threw his pistol into the air, while a green light enveloped him. The gangsters were perplexed, watching as the gun transformed into a UZI with neon green markings. They were even more perplexed, when Edward jumped over the box... Dressed in a black one-piece suit, with silver lines. In large white letters it was written ""Ritcher"" and a number 3 in the back.

Edward caught the UZI out of the air, and it clicked on his heels. The white boot soles began to glow, and he levitated a few centimetres from the floor. The next thing the gangsters saw was this blue-haired boy attacking them with the UZI.

“Quickly, Tragliatore. Over here!” She told Octavia to the mafia leader, As she dragged him through one of the doors, and she kept crouched down so as not to be seen.

Edward continued to dodge bullets while he in turn returned fire. Then he quickly positioned himself in the centre of the room, and began to spin on its axis at high speed, while he continued shooting with the UZI and one of the gangsters' SMG. Generating a storm of bullets, which filled the room. When he stopped, Edward realized that he had made holes in all the walls, covers and enemies in the place. He began to walk towards the hallway that Tragliatore left down. With all the calm in the world, he removed the key from the device, and placed a different one with the symbol of an Oxygen mask and a Sickle.

“Come in! Come in! Quick!"" Octavia shouted at Tragliatore, while holding the door of a small laboratory, which had a small window with a curtain, inside was another of the henchmen, dressed in a white coat. After entering, Octavia's attention was quickly caught by a shelf with some books. Tragliatore watched as his protector began to search the bookshelf. “What's happening, boss? I heard a lot of gunshots and-” Quickly, the scientist's words were interrupted by the screams of their leader. “That doesn't matter now! We are under attack, scan the bunker. I want to see how many of my men are still alive!” The henchman typed something on a nearby computer. While Tragliatore was still confused by what Octavia was doing. He was about to ask her, when his employee's surprised moan distracted him. “Bo-boss, there are only four living beings left in the Building…” Tragliatore raised his hands to his face, passing them all over his face, while he let out a long sigh through his mouth.

“Okay, okay, it's manageable, it's manageable… Octavia, we need a plan, can you think of it… Octavia!?” The gangster was surprised when he saw the red-haired girl, with a book from which a white glow came out. And a white circle surrounded her. “I'm sorry, boy, but our deal is going to have to end here…” When Tragliatore tried to stop her, he realized that he couldn't get through the circle. “This was not what was agreed upon, you said that The Guardians were going to fulfil my wish…” Octavia tore the pages from the book, and held them up. “I told you that they were going to grant your wish…” HShe tore pages from the book, which began to orbit her. “If you survived…” Tragliatore was about to reply, until his minion shouted at him, with a tone of perennial terror in his voice. ""MISTER! “he's coming down the hallway, he's coming this way.” Tragliatore's shock was evident in his eyes. And when he turned around to look to Octavia for a solution, he saw that she had disappeared, and the circle on the floor was on fire.

The scientist quickly approached Tragliatore, holding him by the shoulders, his body aligned with the door. On the other side of which footsteps could be heard in the distance. “What do we do now, boss? There are only the two of us left, I don't want to die! My notes are still on the table, if he finds out that I designed that poison, I don't know what he'll do to me!” Tragliatore quickly slapped the soldier away from him. “We're not going to give up, listen this is what we're going to-”

Before Tragliatore could finish the sentence, a metal object came flying through the door window. The sickle hit the scientist directly and stuck into the wall. Blood began to drip from the inert body. Tragliatore recoiled in shock, blood had splattered on his face.

The bottom of the Sickle opened and a small stream of water came out, which floated forming a hand. Which I grab the sickle and take it out of the wall. Causing the man to fall to the floor, Tragliatore watched in shock as the hand stopped in front of the door and slammed hard against the handle. Causing the door to open.

Edward entered through the door, dressed in a black jacket with grey sleeves, accompanied by black neoprene pants. The footsteps of his boots broke the silence of the room like thunder in the night. His face was covered by a hood, accompanied by a black oxygen mask. Tragliatore tried to pull the gun from him, but was quickly restrained by Edward. Which he held against the wall.

“What the fuck do you want? If you're going to kill me, do it now!"" Tragliatore tried to say with the most threatening tone he could. Edward remained silent, taking one of his scissors out of his pocket, beginning to run it across the neck of the mafia leader. ""Wait! Wait! You want money? “I can give you money.” At the offer, Edward stuck the scissors into Tragliatore's leg. Causing blood to flow out, along with a gasp of pain “Agh!!… Okay, Okay, no money. What do you want?""

Edward took out the syringe with a black liquid from his pocket. And he shook it in front of him. ""The poison? Do you want to know how the poison is made? What makes you think I would tell you?” Tragliatore said, finishing his sentence by spitting at Edward. Which was Stoic, took another scissors from his pocket, and stuck it in Tragliatore's hand. Leaving it nailed to the wall. The scream of pain was even louder. “Ugh! In the table! In the notebook on the table!” Edward leave tragliatore, letting the scissors holding him, while he went straight to what he had come for. He took the leather-bound notebook, and opened it to the page that was marked with a red ribbon. On the same page, the process with which the poison had been made was detailed.

After seeing this, Edward began to walk towards the exit door. A white glow enveloped him and his clothes returned to his usual trench coat. Tragliatore couldn't contain his frustration and shouted at Edward, “Really? You entered my base, you killed all my staff, that's why? All this for that Bea-” Before he could finish the sentence, Edward turned on his heel. Throwing a pair of scissors directly at Tragliatore's forehead. The scissors remained stuck in the wall. Leaving a hole in Tragliatore's face. “DON'T YOU DARE TALK BADLY ABOUT HER IN MY PRESENCE, EVER!"" After this, Edward adjusts his bangs, and begins to walk out of the underground base. Willing to achieve it.

***Out of Continuity: Lair of the Society / Three days later…***

Edward is sitting next to Erin's stretcher, his brain racing with different ideas. ""What if the dosage is wrong? What if I misread the notes? What if I made a mistake, what if...""

A slap on the back from Elizabeth brought him back to reality. The green-haired girl was bringing him a cup of coffee. ""You need to slow down..."" The skater set the coffee down on a table and approached Erin. ""Getting nervous will only make you anxious and not think clearly.""

""What makes you think I'm nervous? Rider..."" Edward tried to hide his concern, as he took a sip from the cup. Although Elizabeth quickly retorted, ""Because I know what it's like to see your friends in a coma, and you also move your leg at a speed that makes you look like a drummer...""

The girl's little joke annoyed Edward who quickly stood up.  ""What the hell did you come for? If it was for coffee, thank you. If it was for news, there isn't any. Now get out of my lab.""

Elizabeth shrugged her shoulders. ""I just wanted to check on you two. I'm leaving.""
The green-haired girl walked to the door and stopped in the doorway. ""You know, they say people in a coma can still hear. Maybe you should talk to her to calm her down. And to calm yourself down..."" The girl left, leaving Edward and Erin alone. 

The blue-haired boy stared at the cat-eared girl. The word ""recourage"" echoed in his brain. He slowly sat down next to the bed and took her hand.

""Hi Ro... Erin. I know we've known each other for a long time and I haven't shown much reciprocation to your feelings... but I need you to wake up.

Because you... gave meaning to my life. When I thought everyone was fake and selfish, you showed me something more. In that hug in the storm, you showed me the real you... You let me see the To the scared and pure-hearted girl. For the first time in my life, I felt a beautiful warmth.

That's why I need you to wake up, because there's no one more important to me in my life. You look at me like I'm the best man in the entire multiverse, and that's far from the truth. But I strive, day by day, to be worthy of at least a little of that love. And I swear... *Sniff* To you, to the sky, and to the stars... That you will always be... the most important thing in my life... Please, come back to me.""

The young man ends up breaking down, clinging to the only thing that makes him feel safe.

***Out of Continuity: Lair of the Society / four days later…***

Erin woke up on the stretcher, feeling the numbness of multiple days, her eyes slowly opening as her senses began to return. She looked around her, recognizing the medical equipment and monitors that were still beeping softly. She sat up on the bed with some effort, and her gaze fell on Edward, who was sitting next to her.

Edward was completely disheveled, with deep circles under his eyes that marked his tired face. He tapped his foot on the floor at high speed, clearly nervous. Next to him, the table was littered with a lot of empty coffee cups.

""Edward?"" Erin asked in a weak voice. Edward looked up quickly, his eyes filled with a mix of surprise and relief. Realizing that he hadn't imagined the sound of Erin's voice, he jumped up and hugged her with strength.

""You are fine!"" he exclaimed, he words filled with emotion. Edward moved away from her a little, holding Erin's face with her hands under her cheeks.

""Yeah...I'm fine,"" Erin responded, still a little disoriented. Then she noticed the black marks under Edward's eyes and frowned in concern. ""My God...Edward, your eyes... are you okay?""

Edward couldn't help but let out a small laugh. ""You wake up from a coma, and the first thing you ask me is if I'm okay?"" After that, Edward hugged her again, resting his jaw on top of her head. Erin just enjoyed the hug, feeling the warm and security that he gave her.

Suddenly, she felt drops falling on her head. Erin looked up and saw the tears falling from Edward's eyes. ""Edward... What's going on?"" she asked in a soft voice.

Edward grabbed her chin again and brought her face closer to his, causing Erin to blush. ""What is going on?"" Edward moved forward, planting a kiss on Erin's lips. The shock to Erin's mind was brutal, but soon she began to enjoy it. After several minutes, Edward broke the kiss and looked at Erin with a look he'd never had before. ""***That*** is what going on..."" Edward said softly, hugging her again.

 ""I Love you, Erin""

In 2024, he took on the male lead in the Prime Video series “Maxton Hall - The World Between Us”. He can now be seen in the vampire series “Love Sucks” (from October 11, [ZDF online](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/kultur/tv-streaming/zdf/) ). But the 26-year-old [actor](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/panorama/schauspieler/) refuses to pigeonhole the industry and prefers to attend urology lectures as a student. 

Q:There's a lot going on in your life at the moment. Aside from ""Love Sucks"", your hit series ""Maxton Hall"" is continuing and now you're also shooting your first international production... 

Damian Hardung: Yes, I am also looking forward to slowing down.



Q: It's certainly not that easy to achieve.

Hardung: Ideally, I find time for that between projects. Or I just take the bull by the horns: I simply process the lack of slowing down in my role. That is the privilege of this often strange [job](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/ratgeber-wissen/beruf/) , working on issues that also concern you in your private life. My current role has a ""Do More"" tattoo as a reminder and is learning to say ""no"". I can perhaps learn something from that. And for me it is probably less about slowing down than about a change of rhythm, the switch from output to new input.

Hardung: For example, on the last two days of my urology internship. During a partial bladder resection, I get different input than when I'm on set. 

Q:That's why he sometimes doubts his acting career. You mentioned your medical studies. Would it be conceivable that you would give up acting for a career as a doctor? 

Hardung: Definitely. In acting, I always come to points where I think to myself: What am I doing here? It helps to think that when I'm 30, I can say: ""Thank you, it was nice. I've done this for 20 years. Now it's time for something else."" I definitely want to keep that door open for myself. 

Q:In “Love Sucks” the question is asked: “Is this your idea of ​​real life?” What is yours? 

Hardung: On my current journey from role to role, I often ask myself: Where does fiction begin and where does reality end? I consciously look for moments where you get so deeply into a role that the fiction feels like reality. But for me, real life takes place beyond all roles, including the role of Damian Hardung. 

Q: To put it another way: When do you feel authentic? 

Hardung: There are many words that try to describe exactly that, whether in the moment of resonance according to Hartmut Rosa \[German sociologist and political scientist – editor's note\] or in the experience of the sense of coherence according to Antonovsky \[Israeli-American sociologist – editor's note\]. Ultimately, I always feel authentic when my inner self is in harmony with the outside world. When I notice that I am exactly right where I am right now. You can also feel good when you enjoy yourself. 

Q:Since the series is set heavily in the nightlife scene, do you have the time to indulge in such things or are you completely occupied with all your activities?

Hardung: I would say that I can indulge in hedonism  even when doing sports or drinking my [morning coffee .](https://archive.is/o/3bnXh/https://www.morgenpost.de/ratgeber/article238568651/kaffee-tassen-darm-expertin-wirkung-effekt-toilette-gesundheit.html)

Q: Does that mean you don't have to go to clubs and bars anymore? 

Hardung: Epicureanism is not just excess in nightlife, although that is certainly a striking manifestation. It can be excess in all areas that provide physical pleasure. A round of Spikeball can also have something extremely hedonistic about it. 

Q: That is why Damian Hardung does not believe in overly intellectual life planning. You are studying medicine, you were a footballer, and in the interview you quote technical terms from thinkers and scientists. Do you sometimes feel under-challenged by life? 

Hardung: No, I definitely don't have the feeling that life doesn't offer me enough or doesn't challenge me enough. I can say that I can't say that at all. I'm incredibly happy that so much is thrown my way. I have to look at what is suitable for me and what has nothing to do with me at all. 

Q: International film projects such as the romantic drama “Into The Deep Blue” have now been added to your activities. Are you consciously striving for a global career or are you just taking it easy? 

Hardung: I never had a plan and there will never be a five-year plan. Maybe after the next project I'll say: ""Guys, that was nice, but I need something different now."" I just want to be open to feel inside myself instead of saying in an overly intellectual way: ""Yes, but I still wanted to do this and that in America."" I don't want to approach my job like that.

I was taking clonazepam and Zoloft for almost 7 years, but I quit them three months ago because I felt like a zombie and was mostly asleep for those eight years. I started working out and eating healthy, and I hadn't experienced a panic attack for almost 5 months. However, two days ago I had a strong coffee which triggered one of the strongest panic attacks I've ever experienced. Today I almost had another one, but it was milder. I don't take any medications anymore and don't want to start taking them again. My body and mind are exhausted (I don't know how else to describe it) which I know pretty much it should be because of the panic attack two days ago. I feel like a failure as if I lost again.

1g1qedo,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1g1qedo/full_itinerary_and_reviews/,Full Itinerary and Reviews,"I traveled to Puerto Rico during the first week of October. I am nuyorican, and I've visited the island a few times for family reunions, relaxing getaways, and rainforest adventures. This time, I brought my boyfriend for the first time. Since it was his first time, we did quite a few touristy activities, but it was still lots of fun, and we had some less touristy food. I decided this would be a good opportunity to share my itinerary and reviews in case anyone's looking to visit the island soon.

**Duration**  
5 nights, 6 days (Monday - Saturday)

**Time of Year**  
October

I know lots of travelers have concerns about traveling to the Caribbean in October, since hurricane season is from June to November. But the risk was worth the reward. I would recommend purchasing insurance, in case you have to reschedule your trip due to any potential storms if you plan to travel at this time of year (especially between July and September).

**Itinerary**  
We are a very low-key couple. We don't love to party, and we tend to be early risers. If you're into relaxing low-key vacations, then this itinerary may be for you. If you love a party vibe, maybe skip to the reviews below :)

**The Hotel**

We stayed at [The Fairmont El San Juan](https://www.elsanjuanhotel.com/) in Isla Verde. This hotel is a middle ground as far as price goes, and it is extremely convenience, since it's about a 10 minute Uber ride from SJU airport, and 15-20 minutes into Old San Juan. This historic hotel was opened in 1958 and the lobby features an old world feel with dark wood accents, stunning design features, and a regal feel. It is a tad too dark in the daytime, but it creates a whole different atmosphere at night. While children are allowed at this hotel, you aren't likely to see too many of them due to the more adult party vibe of the hotel.

*Hotel Amenities*

* Large pool area with multiple pools, hot tubs, and an 18+ only pool
* Direct beach access
* Foxwoods Casino
* Live Music on Mondays, along with multiple social events in the lobby throughout the week
* Brava nightclub
* Multiple restaurants and bars
* Shopping area with shops, more restaurants, and Starbucks

Conclusion: If you're a party person, this hotel is perfect! It may not be the right hotel for you if you're looking for a chill vibe. For something more relaxed, I'd recommend the hotel next door, The Royal Sonesta.

**The Restaurants**

* **Casita Miramar (7.4/10):** Located in San Juan, this restaurant is one of two owned by the same person. Casita Blanca features more traditional Puerto Rican food (think lunchtime). Casita Miramar is Casita Blanca's older, more sophisticated sibling, with traditional flavors being reworked for an upscale crowd. The views are beautiful, and the neighborhood is quiet. I would recommend getting a reservation if you plane to dine on a weekend. Also, GET THE TRES LECHES CAKE. You will not be disappointed.
   * 605 Av. Miramar, San Juan, 00907, Puerto Rico
* **Kaffe Haus (8.6/10):** This is probably my favorite breakfast spot in Old San Juan. The decor is really cute and hip, and the coffee is delicious! I love a sweet breakfast, but their savory breakfasts are to die for. If you'll be in OSJ, definitely try this cafe out.
   * 311 C. Tetuán, San Juan, 00901, Puerto Rico
* **Deaverdura (7.9/10):** I like hitting this spot for lunch. While it's more touristy, it is far from a trap. The flavors are quite traditional, and you get a lot of food for a little bit of money. If you're looking to dip your toe into Puerto Rican cuisine, this restaurant has a sampler plate, which comes on a really cute wooden cheese board in the shape of PR. This is a 10/10 lunch spot in my book! Be prepared to wait a bit since it's a small space.
   * 200 Sol St, San Juan, 00901, Puerto Rico
* **Il Sole (5.7/10):** This Italian restaurant is located in the Fairmont. Not only is convenient, but the pizza is pretty good! It's expensive, as hotel food is, but it's a great option for an easier night in the hotel after a long day of activity. I wouldn't visit this restaurant if I wasn't staying at The Fairmont, but I'd skip Caña (the hotel restaurant) and go here if I was.
   * 6063 Isla Verde Avenue Carolina, Puerto Rico 00979
* **Panaderia las Canarias (7.9/10):** I didn't have a chance to have lunch here, so I can only rate it based on breakfast, but if I had to guess, their lunch is pretty good. Their breakfast platters are not only huge, but they are so delicious! The breakfast quesadilla with bacon is a must-have if you like a savory breakfast. If you're more of a sweet breakfast kind of person, their pancakes are fresh and fluffy. What really impressed me was their fresh squeezed, pulp free orange juice. It was delicious! If I have a chance to stay nearby again, I would go for lunch one day. I bet their pastelillos and sorullitos are good.
   * 6700, Calle Marginal, Carolina, 00979, Puerto Rico
* **Bacaro (9.2/10):** This is by far the best Italian restaurant I've ever had. It's a bit of a hidden gem in Old San Juan, but once you step inside, you're greeted by a cozy atmosphere that blends classic OSJ style with Italian decor. The place is a bit small, and I'd recommend a reservation, regardless of the day of the week. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, and it wasn't too salty, too bland, over or under seasoned. It was just perfect! It is no frills and a great place to escape into a quiet scene in the city. 
   * 152 C. de la Cruz, San Juan, 00901, Puerto Rico

**The Attractions**

* **El Morro**: There are actually two forts on the island. The larger and more popular of the two is[ Castillo San Felipe del Morro](https://carabalirainforestpark.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwmaO4BhAhEiwA5p4YL-nPSeYq1ppxUMozrPojDkuQZYqHDyvUqpwOIlbxdCoyAqhCpknQpBoC75AQAvD_BwE). This is a must see if you'll be in or around San Juan. Not only are the views stunning, but it's a great way to learn about the history of the island. Admission is $10, and this grants you admission all day to both forts. If you visit Castillo San Felipe del Morro, I would say you can skip Castillo San Cristobal. The park is gorgeous and well maintained, but be aware of the sun. There is no A/C and no shade. You will burn or overheat very easily, so bring lots of water, and be mindful of the heat. Heat exhaustion is no joke. 
* **Old San Juan:** This part of the city is absolutely stunning. It's very historical, and every street is lined with colorful townhomes and shops. If you love cats, keep your eyes peeled on the outskirts of the city. There are tons of stray cats in Puerto Rico.
* **Carabali Rainforest Park:** [This park](https://carabalirainforestpark.com/?gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwmaO4BhAhEiwA5p4YL-nPSeYq1ppxUMozrPojDkuQZYqHDyvUqpwOIlbxdCoyAqhCpknQpBoC75AQAvD_BwE) is about a 30-40 minute drive from San Juan, so I'd recommend renting a car for the day to get here. This 600-acre farmland in the foothills of El Yunque rainforest boasts activities like horseback riding, ATVs, UTVs, and go-karting. We found it last minute and decided to do a horseback riding tour. This was a highlight of my trip. I wouldn't say it was a replacement for a hike through the rainforest, but if you're looking for something less strenuous and time consuming, this is a good option. I loved being able to experience nature on horseback. The staff assign you a horse based on weight, and the horses are very well trained and sweet. You're provided with a helmet, and I would recommend wearing long pants. We stopped at the restaurant on-site for lunch and had a filling meal for just $40. It was a great way to get away from the city for the morning, and we made it back to the hotel in time for a dip in the pool before dinner. ",1,1728700120.0,PuertoRicoTravel,0,1.0,False

According to nutritionists, great supplements boost metabolism, suppress appetite, and shed fat. If their opinions are anything to go by, here are the top 10 weight loss supplements recommended by experts to try in 2024: 

[**PhenQ exceeded my expectations! It curbed my appetite and gave me the energy I needed to stick to my workout**](https://www.wb22trk.com/XR12ZC/BP658/)

1. PhenQ  
  
PhenQ is one of the most popular all-in-one solutions to target different aspects of weight loss: fat burning, appetite reduction, and prevention of new fat cells. With the blend of natural ingredients such as Capsimax Powder combined with caffeine, it instantly becomes a favorite-the effectiveness for long-term results is just a bonus. 2. Zotrim  
  
Zotrim has proved to be a reliable herbal appetite suppressant, which would just be great for anyone who wants to eat a bit less throughout the day. Made from yerba maté, guarana, and damiana, this particular herbal-based appetite suppressant regulates hunger and energizes the body for a longer period of time.  
3. Leanbean  
  
Leanbean is intended for women only; it combines appetite suppressants with facilities of boosting metabolism. Glucomannan, a fiber from nature that promotes satiety, helps you stick to calorie restriction with much ease.  
4. Garcinia Cambogia Extract  
  
Garcinia Cambogia is known for its hydroxycitric acid active ingredient, believed to impede fat production and affect appetite. Many nutritionists recommend it to people searching for a natural fat-blocking solution.  
5. Extract of Green Tea  
  
Rich in antioxidants, green tea extract has been proven to enhance the burning of fat, particularly during exercise. It finds a place in most weight loss programs due to its metabolism-enhancing properties and enhancement of fat oxidation.  
6. Hydroxycut  
  
Hydroxycut is a well-known brand name within the arena of weight loss. It contains a blend of caffeine, green coffee extract, and other plant extracts. What it does is give you an energy boost and help burn more fat effectively in the body.  
7. Glucomannan  
  
As a natural fiber extracted from the root of the konjac plant, glucomannan expands in your stomach, which tends to make you feel fuller longer. This supplement joins my top recommendations for appetite suppression and support for a calorie deficit.  
8. CLA (Conjugated Linoleic Acid)  
  
CLA is a naturally occurring fatty acid usually sourced from meat and dairy products. It's considered great for reducing body fat while improving the tone of the muscles, which is why it's one of the most used food additives when building lean body mass through weight loss. 9. Caffeine  
  
A classic fat burner, caffeine is known for boosting your metabolism and triggering the oxidation of fat. The energy- and performance-boosting action makes many weight loss supplements feature it as a main ingredient, making it easier for one to stay active. 10. Apple Cider Vinegar  
  
Also, apple cider vinegar has been related to several benefits to health, such as weight loss. It contributes to appetite suppression, which increases metabolism and reduces fat storage. Nutritionists usually recommend the product as a natural product that can complement one's health through a healthy diet.

Hey fellow wanderers! 🌍 I'm Derek, aka u/solopassions, and I'm here to spill the tea (or should I say, the travel coffee?) on the utterly manic, life-changing experience of solo travel. 😎✈️

Ever found yourself on a hummus-fueled binge while Googling ""solo travel adventures"" at 3 AM? No? Just me? Okay, moving on... 😅

Picture this: a wide-eyed, map-clutching me, plopped in the middle of Barcelona, decoding the mystery of where the heck I was (hint: not in front of that famous Sagrada Familia – thanks, Google Maps!).

**Unique Experiences & Challenges:**
- **Fine Dining for One**: Ever had a table for one at a fancy restaurant? Yes, you will awkwardly exchange glances with romantic couples, and yes, the waiter will ask twice if you're expecting someone. Spoiler: You're totally gonna flaunt your independence like it's nobody's business! 🍽️
  
- **Lost in Translation**: When my five-star attempt at ordering coffee in Paris turned into accidentally purchasing... directions to the Eiffel Tower. Who knew ""café"" and ""café au lait"" could be so tricky? 🤷‍♂️☕

**Solo Travel Revelation (aka Personal Growth)**:
- I'd always thought ""personal growth"" was one of those cliché stretch-your-yoga-mat phrases. But solo travel showed me that I could rock decisions like a pro – like cutting through hidden alleys in Rome or finding THAT non-touristy tango club in Buenos Aires.

Pro-tip: Solo travel upgrades your internal GPS and offers a crash course in ""Trust Your Gut 101."" 🎯

**Derek's Solo Travel Tips**:
- **Say Yes to New**: Embrace the unexpected – whether it's that cooking class in Florence or karaoke in a Tokyo dive bar. They’ll become your golden stories. 🎤🎶

- **Fear is Part of the Journey**: Feel the fear and do it anyway... or as I like to call it, “Adventuring with Palpitations” (not as catchy, but you get the drift).

- **Solo Selfies are Unapologetically Epic**: A selfie stick or a trusty rock-ledge, and boom, your new Instagram-worthy shot. #nofilternoneedsubtle #theselfielife 📸

Remember, dear friends, sometimes the best company is yourself. Much like our favorite Drifter Hotel in New Orleans, the magic of solo travel lies in weaving together history, surprise, and a dash of that drifter ethos. It's not just about discovering places, it's about discovering YOU in those places.

Embark on YOUR solo escapade and who knows? Maybe we'll bump into each other, wielding maps and coffee, living our best self-discovery dreams!

Happy travels! 🚀💫

1g1q8q9,https://www.reddit.com/r/gravesdisease/comments/1g1q8q9/my_story_and_how_im_cured_from_graves/,My story and how I'm cured from Graves.,"In 2020, when Covid hit, I started experiencing some serious health issues—heart palpitations, hand tremors, light sensitivity, painful joints, fatigue, and insomnia. Initially, I worried it was heart problems, but after visiting a doctor and running tests, everything came back negative. He suggested a thyroid issue, so I consulted three endocrinologists. One did an ultrasound and said my thyroid was self-destructing and recommended a thyroidectomy. Confused by the conflicting opinions, I’m grateful I decided against that.



Then I stumbled upon a YouTube video saying hand tremors could be linked to B1 deficiency, so I tried the supplement—and my hand shaking stopped within days. This sparked my journey into researching my health. I experienced some scary thyrotoxicosis episodes during this time, and looking back, I wish I had taken medication until I stabilized. Instead, I found a supplement called thyroid calming, along with vitamin D and magnesium. My eyes bulged and wouldn’t close during sleep, which was alarming.



Eventually, I discovered the carnivore diet, an elimination plan consisting only of meat, salt, and water. I approached it with hope and added low-dose naltrexone (LDN) to my routine. Thanks to God, my health improved, and even my eyes returned to normal. I had thought my life was over, but I was given a second chance.



I later learned certain foods triggered my autoimmune symptoms, which can vary for everyone. For me, they were eggs, grains, chocolate, and coffee. Now, at 35, I’m stronger than ever—working out daily and feeling energized.



If you’re dealing with a similar condition, here’s my advice: avoid blue light two hours before bed, keep your room dark for sleep, aim for at least eight hours of rest, get two hours of sunlight daily (especially in the morning), don’t eat four hours before bed, eat fatty meats and broth, do some light exercise, manage stress, and communicate your struggles to those around you. It can be tough at first, but stay consistent. If I could do it, so can you!",0,1728699582.0,gravesdisease,0,0.25,False

1g1q4w4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CasualConversation/comments/1g1q4w4/i_love_the_flavor_of_coffee_and_all_complementary/,I love the flavor of coffee and all complementary flavors,"I remember growing up through K12 that I was proud that I wasn't a coffee drinker. I have always been a morning lark and still am, but I took pride that I didn't need caffeine to get myself up. I only started to drink coffee in college. I honestly don't remember why, but I got hooked. I think it was my Mom to helped me to start drinking coffee. Ever since I have become a coffee fanatic.

I now own a kalita wave and the best coffee I drink is the one I brew myself.

But I also adore everything that pairs well with coffee! Amaretto liquor is absolutely divine, and pairs fantastically with coffee. Tiramisu is an elite dessert. Finishing a big steak dinner with an espresso is divine. Kahula coffee liquor tastes pretty good too. Eating a coffee-based dessert like tiramisu while drinking any red wine is divine as well. The best beer with some coffee based notes is Guinness. I love the foaminess.

Best commercial ice cream coffee in my opinion is Haagen Daaz. Another really good coffee ice cream is Boba x Ice Cream Espresso coffee.

Sambuca is an anise based liquor is great and traditional a shot of is drinked with 3 coffee beans.

Coffee. Anise. Amaretto. Red Wine. Tiramisu. Guinness. Red meat. Kahula. Maybe even some gin. Whiskey. This is all elite.

Can anyone recommend a good cocktail with these flavor profiles?

  
Edit: I wanted to add another underrated flavor: Biscoff. And of course biscotti snacks, but biscoff pairs extraordinarily well with coffee. Of course, its made by Italians after all!",1,1728699221.0,CasualConversation,1,1.0,False

1g1q43w,https://www.reddit.com/r/ReviewsHaven/comments/1g1q43w/java_burn_the_revolutionary_coffee_supplement_for/,Java Burn: The Revolutionary Coffee Supplement for Boosting Metabolism and Energy,"Java Burn is not just another dietary supplement—it’s the **world’s first and only 100% natural, patent-pending formula** that, when mixed with coffee, ignites your metabolism and enhances energy levels like never before. This unique combination of powerful natural ingredients is designed to work synergistically with your coffee, turning it into a fat-burning powerhouse. Whether you’re looking to shed stubborn fat, increase your energy, or improve your overall health, Java Burn could be the key.

In this article, we’ll dive deep into the benefits, ingredients, and science behind **Java Burn** and why it stands out as the ultimate supplement for coffee lovers seeking to supercharge their metabolism.

# What is Java Burn?

Java Burn is a **tasteless, instantly dissolvable powder** you add to your morning coffee. This innovative formula accelerates metabolism and torches fat. It provides all-day energy without the jitters or crashes commonly associated with traditional fat burners or energy supplements.

**Java Burn’s key selling points include:**

* **100% all-natural ingredients**
* **Vegetarian-friendly, gluten-free, and non-GMO**
* **No artificial colors, preservatives, or stimulants**
* **Manufactured in the USA** under strict FDA and GMP-certified standards
* Proven to be **completely safe and side-effect-free**



# [==>> Visit Official Website](https://bit.ly/3Mx8gXm)



# How Does Java Burn Work?

The secret behind **Java Burn’s effectiveness** lies in **Nutritional Synergy**. The formula works by combining with the natural compounds in coffee to **boost both the speed and efficiency of metabolism**. You can burn more calories and fat throughout the day, even at rest.

**When you take Java Burn with your morning coffee**, two robust processes are triggered:

1. **Metabolic Acceleration**: Java Burn helps kickstart your metabolism, making your body burn fat faster than usual.
2. **Fat Mobilization**: It helps move stored fat into your bloodstream to be used as energy, making fat-burning more efficient.

Not only does this process lead to **faster fat loss**, but it also provides a **steady energy boost** throughout the day. Unlike other supplements that may leave you feeling jittery or cause crashes, Java Burn works smoothly alongside your coffee, so you only experience a steady flow of energy and improved focus.

# The Benefits of Java Burn

# Accelerated Fat Burning

Java Burn’s proprietary blend is specifically formulated to **target stubborn fat in problem areas**. By speeding up your metabolism, your body naturally burns more calories, reducing body fat over time. Java Burn is especially effective when used consistently over **90-180 days**, ensuring long-term fat loss.

**All-Day Energy and Focus**

If you struggle with energy dips during the day, Java Burn can help. When combined with coffee, Java Burn provides a **sustained boost in energy levels** throughout the day. Whether working, exercising, or running errands, Java Burn keeps you going strong without the typical energy crashes you get from sugary snacks or energy drinks.

**Appetite Suppression and Reduced Cravings**

One of the biggest hurdles in any weight loss journey is hunger and cravings. **Java Burn reduces appetite and suppresses cravings**, making it easier to stick to your diet and avoid unnecessary snacking. By balancing blood sugar levels, Java Burn helps control those hunger pangs that can sabotage your progress.

**Improved Health and Well-Being**

In addition to its fat-burning and energy-boosting properties, **Java Burn supports overall health**. The blend includes ingredients that enhance metabolism and provide **antioxidant benefits**. This means you’re losing weight and **boosting your immune system, reducing inflammation, and promoting overall wellness**.

# Key Ingredients in Java Burn

The effectiveness of Java Burn lies in its carefully chosen, all-natural ingredients. Each ingredient is critical in boosting metabolism or improving overall health.

# L-Theanine

**L-Theanine** is an amino acid commonly found in tea leaves. Combined with caffeine (as in Java Burn), it helps provide a **smooth, long-lasting energy boost** without the typical jitters or crashes associated with coffee.

He seemed *pretty* cute, but what attracted me were his interests and positive attitude about life. On a physical level, he seemed pretty average with a cute face, and good style. I am pretty attractive, but not hot. Maybe I am to some- to each their own right?

We've messaged a lot, and have many shared interests beyond what was initially visible. We have been vulnerable, kind, matched in chattiness, wit, dark humor and life outlook. The more I get to know him, the more attracted I am. He is sexy without trying in both his ability to communicate effectively and be playful whilst considerate. 

Now that I have met him in person for a coffee date, I am realizing he is actually, without any question in my opinion, MORE attractive than I am. In a way that is making me feel pretty...beneath. We have another date on Friday, and it's leaving me with a pit in my stomach. Like he's going to catch on. He's hotter than I am. Like for sure.

She’s been feeling down so I asked her to have a girls day with me. First thing on the agenda is lunch. Great! She picks the place, we go, the waitress comes about 15 minutes after we got there. She orders coffee and water. Waitress comes back with a coffee. Leaves again for another 10ish minutes. Comes back to take our order, we get some eggs and sausage and toast (she wanted breakfast). We get our food about half an hour after ordering. So we are there almost an hour before we even get our food. The waitress checked on us once after bringing our food and brought me a water (still has not brought his mom a water). Total comes out to about $20. I leave a $5 cash tip on the table. I go to pay up front and there is no “no tip” option. I choose the “other” option and it does NOT let you proceed if you type $0. So I type 1¢ because I just left her $5 in cash and the service wasn’t even good. The lady at the cash register yells (now mind you this is a small diner so everyone there turned to look at me) “YOU ONLY LEFT HER 1¢ I’M SURE THIS WAS A MISTAKE. HOW MUCH WOULD YOU ACTUALLY LIKE TO LEAVE HER”. I responded “I left a $5 cash tip on the table I figured that was enough” and she goes “WELL IF YOU LEFT A $5 TIP, YOU DIDN’T NEED TO ONLY LEAVE HER 1¢”

So we both have the exams,she cracked IIT and got into an old IIT with the best branch and I gave neet scored 660 before result she texted me that she want to have a coffee with me that was the most memorable day I have with her,she also hinted that she liked me.But the black clouds came the result of neet 2024 released,I got 19k rank at this I will get peripheral gmc in UP, she used to text daily that we will sail through this also,as we sailed through hardships in preparation,but I developed a feeling that I am not worthy of her love ,I am incompetent of her love as she is studying in best college and I am just in peripheral college what could I provide her.She texted me again to meet at cafe but since then I never texted her back,she calls I don't pick up,but I am deeply in love with her but feel unworthy.She comes to my dream now and then.

1g1py2s,https://i.redd.it/59zyripeg8ud1.jpeg,Murad played you,"Did you see the game happen right in front of your face and miss it? Are you the “dumb money” that real finance guys rely on for their massive wealth? If you aped into any of the cryptocurrencies that were pushed hard by Mr Murad a week or two after his presentation on the FOMO of the green candle, you probably are.

Remember the content of the presentation: the believers hold the key to success, while those chasing green candles often miss the bigger picture. Murad's presentation, a blueprint of foresight and strategy, was lost on those who rushed to the finish line without understanding the journey. They saw a surge, a fleeting opportunity, and dove in completely unaware that the true value lies in patience and belief.

The Kendu community has been built on conviction, not just momentary gains. Those chasing the rise often don’t realize that Murad and others like him, high-finance players, have a different agenda. They're not involved in the daily grind of Telegram posts or votes. They don’t need to be. Their quiet exit is assured, but it’s the real believers who will thrive, watching the short-term chasers learn a hard lesson.

This is why Kendu’s foundation is strong. It's not driven by instant gratification or fleeting trends; it’s sustained by those who see the vision beyond the green candles. While the candle chasers cry over missed opportunities, the true Kendu cult will rise, undeterred and stronger than ever. As Murad demonstrated his strategy right in front of them, many missed the game entirely. 

And the fact that he explicitly did not include Kendu despite the obvious connection to everything he claimed to call for in a cryptocurrency is a sign that he knows his own game too well. If he tells you the best plays ahead of time, he can’t make them! Once the $kenduchad wallet drains out to build the Kendu Chad NFT ecosystem, this will be the rare meme coin with a functioning utility, an energy drink for sale right now, a coffee brand, and, where it is legal,  a medicinal marijuana brand. This isn’t just a bunch of videos saying “BELiEVE!” But a cult that actually delivers products to the real world.

And you know what I’m talking about because the Kendu Cult is relentless. They’re all over social media, making crazy videos, buying billboards, throwing parties in night clubs. This is a movement, and it is at bargain-basement consolidation while all the jeets are chasing a fleeting green candle behind a KOL that played them right out in the open for fools, to their faces. Murad knew you would skip the presentation, skip the homework that he did, skip the whole lesson, and just jump to his picks. And you are making him and the believers who are slowly exiting as wealthy men and women right now rich because of Murad knew the overwhelming majority of the crypto audience will miss the point and chase the candle.

If you're still here, it means you're part of something bigger. Kendu isn’t just a token; it’s a movement for those who believe in the long term, not just the temporary highs. Be a believer. In the end, you’re the one who will win.

Dear Bishop ""Smith"" [name changed],

I know you have been released and called again since our last conversation, however, rather than resigning my membership anonymously through church headquarters, I want to explain to you in no uncertain terms why.

As a young woman, I must have been 14 or 15 as I was a MIA Maid, my puberty was not normal and my parents sought medical advice for me. I was diagnosed as having Complete Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome.

Telling you I had learned I was genetically male (XY), but due to a genetic fault my body had developed mostly female was one of the hardest things I have ever had to do.

For any girl, this is devastating news. What I needed was unconditional love and support. You could have put your arm around me and Said ""Listen Robyn, we're here for you. We'll support you through this.""

What actually happened was you removed my name from the group temple recommend for baptisms as you couldn't say whether I should be a proxy for men or women.

Further, you counselled me not to mentally prepare for dating/marriage as, if in the next life it turned out I have a male spirit, myself and my future husband would risk being condemned for our homosexuality. You also made a remark that my inability to bear children might make it difficult to find a husband.

You even went as far as suggesting I remove my earrings and wear clothes appropriate to both sexes so whichever gender my spirit was, I dressed appropriately.

By any description, that was nothing short of mental child abuse.

Strangely, this was not led me to going inactive. As you were obviously unprepared to research the church position on people with ""Disorders of Sexual Development"", I took it upon myself to do so for you. However, researching old conference talks, History of the Church, Journal of Discourses etc opens a world of nonsense that invalidates the Church's truth claims. It couldnt both be true in the 1830s and today. Out of respect I won't detail the reasons here, but I'm perfectly happy to meet you over a cup of coffee, or Barleycup, to discuss if you so wish.

Whilst researching, if you remember, I came to you and explained I had lost my testimony. I had no option but to continue attending with my parents but not to call on me to give a talk, expect tithing or for me to take sacrament or engage in classes.  Despite singing Oh Say What is Truth on a regular basis, you counselled me that finding a testimony is in the bearing of it. In other words, you told me to lie.

This in mind, I would like to ask you to remove my name from the church records. I understand the Church often likes leavers to discuss this with their Bishop. Believe me, I am more than happy to do so.

Yours,

My main question is should I go back to talking to them? Everyone even my husband says I should. I thought I wanted an apology but I’m not sure anymore.

TDLR: my sister ghosted me for months. Told parents she was upset with me. Told parents not to tell me. They did tell me. But told me not to tell sister I knew. I stopped talking to sister. Parents got involved trying to get us to talk. Mother said WILD things. And now I don’t talk to any of them. 

Hello, so background. I (22F) have a sister (32F). We have mostly always been super close. Growing up we had a really ruff childhood. And our parents abused us. Because of this and the age gap my sister became more of a parent and best friend than sister. 

Starting around February my sister suddenly started talking to me less and ignoring my calls. We went from talking multiple times a week/day to once a week maybe. But she always told me she was busy so I tried to understand. 

Then the beginning March she suddenly stopped talking to me all together. I would call her multiple times a day. Then give it a couple of days. I text her but she wouldn’t respond. This went on for weeks. 

While growing up my relationship with my parents was bad now that I’m an adult it had gotten a lot better. So I still talked to my dad. I was talking to him about the situation mostly kinda joking about it. He asked my if I had done something. And if she was mad at me. I told him the truth and that if she was mad at me, I had no reason why. Then my dad said well if she doesn’t talk to you then I’m not watching her kids tomorrow. Honestly, I didn’t think much of that statement because I thought he was using my an excuse not to watch her kids. Haha. 

My dad told my sister this and I also sent her a text asking why we stopped talking? And that I was genuinely curious and clueless because we used to talk all the time. I was left on delivered for days. 

Well it came out, (because my dad told me) that the day he said that my sister got into a big fight with my parents about it. And canceled her plans just so she didn’t have to talk to me. She told my mom and dad that she was mad at me because I have repeatedly miss my 2 nieces and nephews birthdays for years. And that I didn’t invite her to breakfast when I went with my parents and my husband. She also told my parents not to tell me why she was mad at me and to essentially live me in the dark. But of these are things that happened months ago. And we had talked like everything was fine after. 

I told my parents when they tried to talk about it that I wanted an apology. Something I’ve never received ever in this family. Not an apology for her being mad. But for leaving me in the dark and ignoring me. My mother made excuses for my sister. And said the reason she didn’t say anything was for me and my mental health. 

My mother got mad and said that for Mother’s Day all she wants is is to get along. And if we can’t do that not to talk to her til we grow tf up. 

My sister said that she wanted to meet up. At a coffee place and talk. I was hesitant. For the fact that I don’t drive and if Shizz goes sideways I’m stranded there. But I decided I would go if she told me watch we’d be talking about. Because she still didn’t know I knew why she was mad. She lost it. Said she wouldn’t tell me said she wouldn’t be having this conversation on the phone. So I hung up. 

Months go by. My mother tries to get involved again. When I’m talking to my father. She goes in on me. Talking over me the whole time. Here’s some of my favorites. 

1. I don’t understand my sister because I don’t have children and I won’t understand til I do. 
2. That she wishes I would have a child as to humble myself. 
3. That I’m fighting with my sister to somehow recreate the bad relationship my husband has with his brother. 
4. My husband and his brother have a bad relationship because they didn’t have a dad. 
5. My feelings are a personal problem.
6. She doesn’t know why I have to act like the black sheep of the family. 
7. Asked me not to destroy her family. 

There’s more but I think you get the picture. And the end she asked me if I had anything to say. I was so defeated by this point I was crying. I told her talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. And I was going to say more but my phone died.

I get acne if I say sleep 6 instead of 8 hours, workout a \*bit\* too hard etc. I also suffer from DSPD which means I go to bed at around 6 am and to fix this I stayed up for a whole day and instead of actually fixing I got three large pustules in a day.

Generally if I return to my normal sleep diet and take it easy, it resolves in a week or two and I have to be careful not to pick or damage the lesions as im prone to scarring. With full spectrum extract my lesions started contracting within 5 hours and two days later im 100 percent acne free (although I have PIH remaning). I ve tried iodine, aspirin, cypro, anti inflammatory/cortisol stuff like curcumin, saffron, theanine,TUDCA, ACV, progesterone etc and none make any real changes (in terms of the acne ) and I have to wait around 2 weeks for it to subside.

""Violet"" is an Italian fairy tale by Giambattista Basile. It appears in the Pentamerone (The Tales of tales), first published in the 1630s.  
[https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2198/2198-h/2198-h.htm#chap12](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2198/2198-h/2198-h.htm#chap12)

VIOLET  
""Envy is a wind which blows with such violence, that it throws down the props of the reputation of good men, and levels with the ground the crops of good fortune. But, very often, as a punishment from Heaven, when this envious blast seems as if it would cast a person flat on the ground, it aids him instead of attain the happiness he is expecting sooner even than he expected: as you will hear in the story which I shall now tell you.""  
There was once upon a time a good sort of man named Cola Aniello, who had three daughters, Rose, Pink, and Violet, the last of whom was so beautiful that her very look was a syrup of love, which cured the hearts of beholders of all unhappiness. The King's son was burning with love of her, and every time he passed by the little cottage where these three sisters sat at work, he took off his cap and said, ""Good-day, good-day, Violet.""  
""The Prince no longer seeing Violet, and hearing no news of her, good or bad, fell into such grief that his eyes became swollen, his face became pale as ashes, his lips livid; and he neither ate a morsel to get flesh on his body, nor slept a wink to get any rest to his mind. But trying all possible means and offering large rewards, he went about spying and inquiring everywhere until, at last, he discovered where Violet was. Then he sent for the ogre and told him that, finding himself ill (as he might see was the case) he begged of him permission to spend a single day and night in his garden, adding that a small chamber would suffice for him to repose in.""  
Get the ogre to make you a pair of slippers covered with little bells, and leave the rest to us. We will pay him in good coin.  
It is a great truth that from the same wood are formed the statues of idols and the rafters of gallows, kings' thrones and cobblers' stalls; and another strange thing is that from the same rags are made the paper on which the wisdom of sages is recorded, and the crown which is placed on the head of a fool. The same, too, may be said of children: one daughter is good and another bad; one idle, another a good housewife; one fair, another ugly; one spiteful, another kind; one unfortunate, another born to good luck, and who being all of one family ought to be of one nature. But leaving this subject to those who know more about it, I will merely give you an example in the story of the three daughters of the same mother, wherein you will see the difference of manners which brought the wicked daughters into the ditch and the good daughter to the top of the Wheel of Fortune.  
This woman who had three daughters, two of whom were so unlucky that nothing ever succeeded with them, all their projects went wrong, all their hopes were turned to chaff. But the youngest, who was named Nella, was born to good luck, and I verily believe that at her birth all things conspired to bestow on her the best and choicest gifts in their power. The Sky gave her the perfection of its light; Venus, matchless beauty of form; Love, the first dart of his power; Nature, the flower of manners. She never set about any work that it did not go off to a nicety; she never took anything in hand that it did not succeed to a hair; she never stood up to dance, that she did not sit down with applause. On which account she was envied by her jealous sisters and yet not so much as she was loved and wished well to by all others; as greatly as her sisters desired to put her underground, so much more did other folks carry her on the palms of their hands...

THE SERPENT  
It always happens that he who is over-curious in prying into the affairs of other people, strikes his own foot with the axe; and the King of Long-Furrow is a proof of this, who, by poking his nose into secrets, brought his daughter into trouble and ruined his unhappy son-in-law—who, in attempting to make a thrust with his head was left with it broken.  
There was once on a time a gardener's wife, who longed to have a son more than a man in a fever for cold water, or the innkeeper for the arrival of the mail-coach.  
It chanced one day that the poor man went to the mountain to get a faggot, and when he came home and opened it he found a pretty little serpent among the twigs. At the sight of this, Sapatella (for that was the name of the gardener's wife) heaved a deep sigh, and said, ""Alas! even the serpents have their little serpents; but I brought ill-luck with me into this world."" At these words, the little serpent spoke, and said, ""Well, then, since you cannot have children, take me for a child, and you will make a good bargain, for I shall love you better than my mother.""

THE DOVE  
He who is born a prince should not act like a beggar boy. The man who is high in rank ought not to set a bad example to those below him; for the little donkey learns from the big one to eat straw. It is no wonder, therefore, that Heaven sends him troubles by bushels—as happened to a prince who was brought into great difficulties for ill-treating and tormenting a poor woman, so that he was near losing his life miserably.  
When the Prince saw this beautiful apparition he knew not what had befallen him; and, as the beams from the eyes of that crystal face fell upon the tinder of his heart, he was all in a flame, so that he became a lime-kiln wherein the stones of designs were burnt to build the houses of hopes.  
""At this ceremony of the prince, Filadoro's face grew as red as scarlet. But the more Nardo Aniello wished to continue speaking, the more his tongue seemed tied; for in this wretched life there is no wine of enjoyment without dregs of vexation. And just at this moment Filadoro's mother suddenly appeared, who was such an ugly ogress that Nature seemed to have formed her as a model of horrors. Her hair was like a besom of holly; her forehead like a rough stone; her eyes were comets that predicted all sorts of evils; her mouth had tusks like a boar's—in short, from head to foot she was ugly beyond imagination..""

My main question is should I go back to talking to them? Everyone even my husband says I should. I thought I wanted an apology but I’m not sure anymore.

TDLR: my sister ghosted me for months. Told parents she was upset with me. Told parents not to tell me. They did tell me. But told me not to tell sister I knew. I stopped talking to sister. Parents got involved trying to get us to talk. Mother said WILD things. And now I don’t talk to any of them. 

Hello, so background. I (22F) have a sister (32F). We have mostly always been super close. Growing up we had a really ruff childhood. And our parents abused us. Because of this and the age gap my sister became more of a parent and best friend than sister. 

Starting around February my sister suddenly started talking to me less and ignoring my calls. We went from talking multiple times a week/day to once a week maybe. But she always told me she was busy so I tried to understand. 

Then the beginning March she suddenly stopped talking to me all together. I would call her multiple times a day. Then give it a couple of days. I text her but she wouldn’t respond. This went on for weeks. 

While growing up my relationship with my parents was bad now that I’m an adult it had gotten a lot better. So I still talked to my dad. I was talking to him about the situation mostly kinda joking about it. He asked my if I had done something. And if she was mad at me. I told him the truth and that if she was mad at me, I had no reason why. Then my dad said well if she doesn’t talk to you then I’m not watching her kids tomorrow. Honestly, I didn’t think much of that statement because I thought he was using my an excuse not to watch her kids. Haha. 

My dad told my sister this and I also sent her a text asking why we stopped talking? And that I was genuinely curious and clueless because we used to talk all the time. I was left on delivered for days. 

Well it came out, (because my dad told me) that the day he said that my sister got into a big fight with my parents about it. And canceled her plans just so she didn’t have to talk to me. She told my mom and dad that she was mad at me because I have repeatedly miss my 2 nieces and nephews birthdays for years. And that I didn’t invite her to breakfast when I went with my parents and my husband. She also told my parents not to tell me why she was mad at me and to essentially live me in the dark. But of these are things that happened months ago. And we had talked like everything was fine after. 

I told my parents when they tried to talk about it that I wanted an apology. Something I’ve never received ever in this family. Not an apology for her being mad. But for leaving me in the dark and ignoring me. My mother made excuses for my sister. And said the reason she didn’t say anything was for me and my mental health. 

My mother got mad and said that for Mother’s Day all she wants is is to get along. And if we can’t do that not to talk to her til we grow tf up. 

My sister said that she wanted to meet up. At a coffee place and talk. I was hesitant. For the fact that I don’t drive and if Shizz goes sideways I’m stranded there. But I decided I would go if she told me watch we’d be talking about. Because she still didn’t know I knew why she was mad. She lost it. Said she wouldn’t tell me said she wouldn’t be having this conversation on the phone. So I hung up. 

Months go by. My mother tries to get involved again. When I’m talking to my father. She goes in on me. Talking over me the whole time. Here’s some of my favorites. 

1. I don’t understand my sister because I don’t have children and I won’t understand til I do. 
2. That she wishes I would have a child as to humble myself. 
3. That I’m fighting with my sister to somehow recreate the bad relationship my husband has with his brother. 
4. My husband and his brother have a bad relationship because they didn’t have a dad. 
5. My feelings are a personal problem.
6. She doesn’t know why I have to act like the black sheep of the family. 
7. Asked me not to destroy her family. 

There’s more but I think you get the picture. And the end she asked me if I had anything to say. I was so defeated by this point I was crying. I told her talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. And I was going to say more but my phone died.

I’m LilacDewdrops, a 30-year-old Japanese-American (second generation/”nisei”) woman currently living in Stamford, Connecticut on a 9 month teaching fellowship! I have a huge passion for education and teaching and I see myself going down this path in the future. 

I’m 5 '4, deep brown almond shaped eyes and I have medium length dark brown hair. I have two pierced ears and three tattoos (I have a rose on my upper right shoulder, a small bluebird on my right hand and a lilac on my left inner forearm). 

I lead a healthy lifestyle: no soda, smoking, or drugs, and I prefer minimal drinking (Alcohol is expensive!). I enjoy early meals and quieter settings over loud parties, I prefer coffee and cake over booze and shots. I’m an old soul who values meaningful conversations and thoughtful experiences. 

Politically moderate and non-religious, I value kindness and respect. I’ve never been married and don’t have children, but I’m open to the possibility of starting a family with the right person. When not working, I love writing, drawing, listening to synthwave, and watching 80s/90s films. 

I love watching *Gossip Girl*—the original 2007 series, not the 2021 reboot! It would be fantastic to have a partner who’d enjoy watching it with me. My top five favorite films are *Dogfight*, *Stand By Me*, *Career Opportunities*, *Secret Admirer*, and *The Bling Ring* (the 2013 adaptation). As for music, I’m really into songs like “Sunset” by The Midnight, “Summer Eyes” by Coastal, “Big City Lights” by Nitrate, “Miracle Love” by Lazer Club, and “Dangerous Love” by Lazer Club.

While I enjoy my own company, I’m looking to share my life with someone special. I seek a partner who feels like my best friend, someone I’ve known my whole life—someone to wake up next to, share life’s small moments with, and build a connection grounded in genuine friendship and mutual respect. I miss having someone to laugh with over the silliest things, create inside jokes, rest my head on their shoulder, and feel their arms around me. I long for those intimate moments, looking into their eyes as they cup my face with their hands. They say relationships are built on a foundation of friendship, with romance and passion making up the rest. I want us to have a cute, healthy relationship while also genuinely liking each other as people. Does that make sense?

I’m seeking a relationship that’s happy, sweet, and filled with joy—where we can share tender moments, enjoy each other’s company, and be there for one another during challenging times. I want us to share everything, from our daily experiences to our family stories, both the good and the bad—anything that brings us closer together!

* **Past Relationships:** Ideally, there should be no ongoing contact with exes. I’m not in contact with mine, so I’d appreciate it if we could share that understanding. If you’re no longer interested, that’s perfectly fine—just communicate like an adult.
* **Lifestyle:** Non-smoker (weed, cigarettes, vapes, etc.), drug-free (molly, edibles, coke, etc.), moderate drinking is okay.
* **Location:** Connecticut or within 25-35 miles, US/Canada preferred; international connections welcome but may present logistical challenges
* **Communication:** Open to in-person meetings, video calls, phone calls, and texting (WhatsApp or traditional). I enjoy “Good morning” and “Goodnight” texts and GIFs.

**Important to Me:**

* **Consistency and Communication:** I value clear, honest communication. My dating mantra is, “How they treat you is how they feel about you.” Everyone has a phone these days and can take a minute to send a text, showing the other person that they’re on your mind. I count actions above words any day.

* **Looking For:** A cisgender straight man. I respect everyone’s right to love, but I prefer to date cisgender men.

If you’re kind, emotionally stable, and seeking a meaningful connection, I’d love to hear from you. To ensure mutual attraction, please include a photo with your message. If we connect, I’ll gladly share one back. Let’s explore if we can build something special together!

1g1pln5,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1g1pln5/opinion_on_the_ending_spoilers/,Opinion on the Ending [SPOILERS],"I personally think (don’t read the little bit of text that’s here you know who you are) this game could be absolutely BS’d Dark Souls style and have a wild story simply because we have no story (and that’s okay. Never the point of the game when you think about it. Build  factory and neurodivergence!) 

       ADA decided to go nuclear on the human race, or at the very least chose to confront them somehow. She leaves a copy of herself for every planet, and your ADA gets “reset” during this replacement so you know it’s a real time event. My context would be the dialogue at the very end where ada seem to leave on the rocket, announcing the departure from the sky and not just on your HUD like usual implying she’s not there anymore. Why would humanity want you sending the A.I back when it’s live reporting all of your statistics as mentioned in the random updates during project assembly? 

      Then you have the aliens. This story feels like an enhanced version of the classic “man meets machine a.i” sci-fi trope where “A.I meets hyper intelligence” akin to skynet. She was uploaded into a higher intelligence (or something. Literally nothing but weird language between her and the SAM aliens so I guess you could call it whatever you want, and that’s very Dark Souls, in the (worst) best way. 

       To conclude my pretentious youtuber essay, when you look at the AI Expansion Server, there’s a weird flavor text that says “Growth is the unit by which we measure success”. This is the only part with a tool tip so personal and weird. Is ADA, who admitted she’s bonded with you later in the game (in a unique way! I liked the way a cold AI slowly couldn’t stay cold near the end. It was fun.), telling you she has grown? Did she surpass the corporations interest by speaking to the higher intelligence? 




       Or did CoffeeStain just understand the importance of not caring so much about story in a game so grounded in reality? (Resources, Production, Numbers, and nothing else matter. Literally.)

My main question is should I go back to talking to them? Everyone even my husband says I should. I thought I wanted an apology but I’m not sure anymore.

TDLR: my sister ghosted me for months. Told parents she was upset with me. Told parents not to tell me. They did tell me. But told me not to tell sister I knew. I stopped talking to sister. Parents got involved trying to get us to talk. Mother said WILD things. And now I don’t talk to any of them. 

Hello, so background. I (22F) have a sister (32F). We have mostly always been super close. Growing up we had a really ruff childhood. And our parents abused us. Because of this and the age gap my sister became more of a parent and best friend than sister. 

Starting around February my sister suddenly started talking to me less and ignoring my calls. We went from talking multiple times a week/day to once a week maybe. But she always told me she was busy so I tried to understand. 

Then the beginning March she suddenly stopped talking to me all together. I would call her multiple times a day. Then give it a couple of days. I text her but she wouldn’t respond. This went on for weeks. 

While growing up my relationship with my parents was bad now that I’m an adult it had gotten a lot better. So I still talked to my dad. I was talking to him about the situation mostly kinda joking about it. He asked my if I had done something. And if she was mad at me. I told him the truth and that if she was mad at me, I had no reason why. Then my dad said well if she doesn’t talk to you then I’m not watching her kids tomorrow. Honestly, I didn’t think much of that statement because I thought he was using my an excuse not to watch her kids. Haha. 

My dad told my sister this and I also sent her a text asking why we stopped talking? And that I was genuinely curious and clueless because we used to talk all the time. I was left on delivered for days. 

Well it came out, (because my dad told me) that the day he said that my sister got into a big fight with my parents about it. And canceled her plans just so she didn’t have to talk to me. She told my mom and dad that she was mad at me because I have repeatedly miss my 2 nieces and nephews birthdays for years. And that I didn’t invite her to breakfast when I went with my parents and my husband. She also told my parents not to tell me why she was mad at me and to essentially live me in the dark. But of these are things that happened months ago. And we had talked like everything was fine after. 

I told my parents when they tried to talk about it that I wanted an apology. Something I’ve never received ever in this family. Not an apology for her being mad. But for leaving me in the dark and ignoring me. My mother made excuses for my sister. And said the reason she didn’t say anything was for me and my mental health. 

My mother got mad and said that for Mother’s Day all she wants is is to get along. And if we can’t do that not to talk to her til we grow tf up. 

My sister said that she wanted to meet up. At a coffee place and talk. I was hesitant. For the fact that I don’t drive and if Shizz goes sideways I’m stranded there. But I decided I would go if she told me watch we’d be talking about. Because she still didn’t know I knew why she was mad. She lost it. Said she wouldn’t tell me said she wouldn’t be having this conversation on the phone. So I hung up. 

Months go by. My mother tries to get involved again. When I’m talking to my father. She goes in on me. Talking over me the whole time. Here’s some of my favorites. 

1. I don’t understand my sister because I don’t have children and I won’t understand til I do. 
2. That she wishes I would have a child as to humble myself. 
3. That I’m fighting with my sister to somehow recreate the bad relationship my husband has with his brother. 
4. My husband and his brother have a bad relationship because they didn’t have a dad. 
5. My feelings are a personal problem.
6. She doesn’t know why I have to act like the black sheep of the family. 
7. Asked me not to destroy her family. 

There’s more but I think you get the picture. And the end she asked me if I had anything to say. I was so defeated by this point I was crying. I told her talking to her is like talking to a brick wall. And I was going to say more but my phone died. 

I haven’t talked to them since. This happened in July. I’ve kinda been No Contact with them all. I’ve received a  message each from all 3. But the contents are all essentially be the bigger person and get over it. I haven’t responded. ",1,1728697175.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

I'm 29m, 5' 11"", 128lbs. I play tennis 4ish days a week and lift weights the other 2/3 days. Hardcore family history, my dad had triple bypass in his 40s because he wasn't paying attention to his health. His dad had several heart attacks, and so on.

I've been monitoring my cholesterol since I was 13 and have been on a statin for around 5 years now. At its worst it was total 256 (unmedicated) when I was 24. 

I've been taking 20mg of resouvastatin which brought my levels down to total 155. That dose felt HIGH though. 

Since, I started exercising a lot more, making sure I never eat above my daily limit of anything nutritionally, and generally trying to lower my cholesterol naturally along with the statin. After a few years I asked my doctor to bring my dose down to 10mg and test again after 6 months. Well that test just came back at 188, which means I will likely have to return to the higher dosage. 

It's just upsetting thinking my lifestyle and actions can't help this issue alone and I'll have to be in a statin for the rest of my life. Looking for general thoughts, am I not doing enough? I haven't really cut out red meat or coffee completely.

- A safe neighborhood with easy access to green spaces—a nearby park would be ideal!

- I love coffee shops, so having a few within walking or biking distance would be a huge plus.

- A neighborhood with other young professionals would be great as well.

But these are some things I like in this episode:
Mike “but I played air hockey”
Harvey “keep talking and I’m going to bill you” and Harvey’s smile.

Mike “called me a what now?”
and Mike “I am a sucker. When did that happen?” 

Harvey taking Mike’s coffee.

Mike trying to cover his laugh when Louis says “I can come across a bit prickly.”

Donna. 

Mike’s “mm” when Louis asks if he’s the pony. So uncomfortable.

Harvey “I’m responsible for you. It was me.” I think this blows Mike’s mind.

Harvey shoving down what he’s thinking to apologize to the judge for not bringing a copy of the filing. Harvey looking fantastic in court. 

“Iron out a wrinkle” means Harvey’s going to confront a woman he *didn’t* sleep with about lying to her husband. Harvey may have a moral code (he denies it). 

Mike’s face when Gregory comes to Louis’s snap.

Mike playing tennis. PJA said he based Mike on Michael J Fox: the rushing in, dropping things, looking lost. But the tennis scene (short as it is) really does make Mike look completely uncoordinated and klutzy. (Much later in the series Mike will go to the batting cage with Harvey and miss every ball.)

Harvey confronts the judge: Harvey looks amazing.

Mike’s face when Louis takes off his shirt. Hilarious. 

Louis “someone who shares the same proclivities” What? I have never encountered that word used in a context that was not referring to homosexuality or queerness. Every time I see this scene, this is jarring: is Louis implying that Keller smokes pot and is gay/bi, or that Mike is? Seems like it. 

Mike’s face when Louis takes off his shorts. 

The music when stoned Mike is repeatedly pushing the elevator button. 

Stoned Mike hugging Gregory. 

Love the scene between Harvey and Mike: Harvey knows about Louis’s weird pony metaphor (I hope it’s a metaphor), and the headband and wristbands. Love Harvey figuring out that Mike is high, and his delivery. 

Harvey “I’m telling you right now if you try to move in on him—“ Harvey is very possessive. 

It’s good Mike is becoming friends with Rachel. Anyone else would report Mike to HR for being in the women’s room. 

Donna “get in there. And be careful.”

Love the scene between Harvey and Mike, Mike following Harvey around the room. The 146 things which is a Suits meme. Mike saying he needs Harvey to trust him. Harvey’s face when Donna says Jessica wants to see Mike.

Harvey “I think you should tell them to shove it up their ass” and then the whole scene where Harvey is performing for the other attorneys. Harvey’s smile when he says “Yes. That’s what I’m saying.”

Harvey confronting the judge. 

Harvey and Mike in the file room: Harvey smiling when he says the line about interrupting him. Mike wanting to confront Louis himself.

*Ako - syempre

*Husband ko - bf ko siya at the time

*Ex Gfs niya

*Mga ka flirt niya

*Friends niyang kasing kups niya

My husband, bf then, was generally a good person to me pero I felt that there was a disconnect. I dismissed it as him being cautious after many failed relationships with one of them na gustong-gusto talaga niyang mag-work pero ayaw ni girl. 

I guess I was too caught up in life to see the red flags. Takte kung ang iba may red flag, siya na ata ang red person eme. 

We have been together 11 years, married for 2. But we’ve known each other close to 20 years. 

Right before the wedding 2 years ago I learned that he was professing his undying love for his ex to his friends for the first few years that we were together. That stopped though… a long time before we decided to get married. So while I was hurt na parang binato ng hollow blocks sa mukha, I chose to move on. Seeing that my bf then had moved on I trusted him. 

Almost 2 years later, before our 2nd wedding anniversary I found out about everything. 

1. Multiple chats to people who cared to listen to him and GCs created specifically to make fun of me, to complain about me - there was one named Crazy Secks because, apparently, the only good thing about me was my performance in bed. Anything they can make fun of about me, they did - my finances, my mental health decline. And all this while they apparently cared about women’s rights and also of mental health. Obviously, those things did not apply to me. 

2. That he had been prospecting multiple women along with his friends. 
Intern, junior, kaibigan ni ganito ganyan. Favorite pag petite early 20s. 

3. That he had been exaggerating stories about me to make him look like the martyr.

4. That he had been asking other women out for coffee. 

5. That he had been meeting up with an ex on and off for years - I confronted the girl, too because she knew who I was, who dismissingly called it “immaturity” and friendly hang out until she had to be reminded she was flirting back and sent my then bf a pic of her in her panties. 
Kapal nang mukha. 

6. That another ex who also knew me had been sending him her nudes and that he welcomed all of these. Not sure if he reciprocated but will not be surprised. 

7. That he had been picking up and taking the ex home while he couldn’t be bothered to do the same to me - always had to make me go meet him somewhere close to his home, at never akong hinatid sa bahay no matter how late kasi “out of the way”.

8. How he made sure he showed up for her, and had really nice dates with her - an expensive cooking class that he willingly paid for, art exhibit… Samantalang ako, every penny he spent and lent me kahit isang daan lang isusumbat niya sa mukha ko. 

9. How he allowed his friends to also make fun of me despite my spiraling mental health - no thanks to him - kasi siya pala ang may pasimuno. 

10. How he never ran out of targets. 

11. How he made profiles on dating apps.

Does anyone know if there’s some kind of way to get a referral to see an endocrinologist as a T2D?

I’m a T2D - my last A1C was 8.2. I’m on 27u of long acting insulin and taking between 60-80u of fast acting insulin (Humalog) per day. My fasting sugar is usually between 220 and 240, and even going sugar-free and following the KP guidance of 30g-45g of carbs per meal and my sugar will stay above 340/350 easy. I feel like I’m taking a high amount of insulin with relatively little effectiveness. 

I’m from a family with a long history of T2D - grew up helping family members with their shots and whatnot as a kid so I know how the stuff works. My mom was on U500 on a Medtronic Pump for several years.. and extremely sensitive (Humalog U100 did nothing, Novo U100 was better but had to take around 50-60u per meal) to changes between Humalog and Novolog for her fast acting before they put her on the pump. 

I kinda feel like I’m getting the well just try harder and the numbers will go down. Had a cup of black coffee with a splash of milk and some sugar free hazelnut syrup and got told to not drink my coffee as a way to stop a spike. My PharmD on the diabetic team is wanting to increase my insulin to get my A1C to normal and then pull me off of all of my diabetes meds. 

This is incredibly frustrating and I feel like I’m going a bit crazy. Not sure if I even can try to switch out my insulin brands. Kinda wish I was in the Oakland coverage area because they have a medical meal program for T2Ds.. but not an option since it’s outside my coverage area. ",1,1728696364.0,KaiserPermanente,0,1.0,False
1g1pafs,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1g1pafs/stupid_car/,Stupid Car,"Ok so last month, on our way home from a camping trip, my front assist sensor stopped working in my VW. Since it has adaptive cruise control, if that sensor doesn’t work, neither does the cruise control. FOUR HOURS FROM HOME. That was a super fun 4 hours of driving.

So when I had time that week, I looked into it myself to see if it was a simple fix. Best I could determine was that the sensor was getting power, because it has a built-in heating function & it was getting warm. Couldn’t figure out anything past that on my own, so called a couple shops in town to see if it’s something they’d encountered. The one place that I know works on VWs said they didn’t have the tech to work on that sensor, so I should bring it to the dealer. So I called & talked to the service department & made an appointment for today, the first weekday I had time to make the 70-mile drive to them to get it fixed.

I dropped the car off a bit before my 9am appointment time, and since they (of course) didn’t have a loaner vehicle available, I got a ride from their courtesy shuttle to a coffee shop to get some coursework done. 11am, I get a call from the service desk. Turns out the sensor has become misaligned, so an alignment needs to be done on it. Cost? EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS. AMERICAN. I say that sounds pretty steep for an alignment. Response? “Well it’s pretty labor-intensive.” No the fuck it’s not. It takes a fancy tool or computer program or whatever and I would wager an hour, two hours tops. Even if it took all day, $800 is ridiculous. But, no other option, really, except being that asshole on the interstate not using cruise control. If you read that and said “what’s wrong with that?”, fuck you. Fuck you, and get the fuck out of the passing lane. And put down your phone. Ugh.

Anyway, I remember when I bought this 2018 vehicle 3 years ago, I let them slickly talk me into one of those insurance policies that covers mechanical issues. Policy was issued by a company that rhymes with Ball Skate. $3k for 6 years of coverage. So I ask the service guy if this issue would be covered by that. He says he’ll check with Ball Skate & see. In the meantime, go ahead & do the ridiculously overpriced alignment. 230pm I finally get the notification my car is ready. Shuttle back to the dealership, and was this covered by my policy? HAHA FUCK NO IT WASN’T AND YOU’RE FUCKING DUMB IF YOU THOUGHT IT WAS. Why? Well, apparently the sensor didn’t “fail”. It just became misaligned, so that’s a maintenance issue. So an important function stops working & costs $800 to fix, but Ball Skate says it didn’t “fail”. You’re in good hands, though. 

Anyway, fuck this day. I don’t even make $800 in a week after taxes, but this alignment was so “labor-intensive” that they get that out of me for a couple hours of actual work.

But I was possibly rightfully so.

Now let me prefix that this is the story of how I moved away from home. Yes, I petty even then. So let's get this rolling.

--
Ahem. Some years ago when I was still living at home I received a message from my mom informing me that she was going to met up with a friend she'd recently met. And that I shouldn't wait for her to grab dinner. This was more than fine as I was well capable of cooking my own dinner. Some hours pass and I get another text. Asking me if it would be okay to bring this friend home to meet me and so they could continue to spend some time together. As apparently they'd had a really good time conversing and getting to know one another better. 

Now this was a particularly odd request from my mother but not something I was gonna stand in the way of as I knew she could use some friends. But it was odd it seemed important I met this ""friend"" who I still didn't have the name of and who only got referred to as her friend. Come an hour later and in clomps a guy who introduces himself as ""Blake"". Now idk how to describe this but despite the all-smiles on my mom's and this guy's face, alarm bells were going off. He seemed like a decent guy but something kept nagging at the back of my mind. I find out that they met via Facebook dating and had known eachother for 2 weeks. And a month later he moved in, together with a litter of puppies from his Pitbull who accidentally had gotten pregnant. Wonderful dog, but a somewhat neglectful owner, I have to say as it was on his watch that a friend of his's dog and Quila (aka Tequila) as the Pitbull was named ""got into contact with one another"". It was her first litter at 7 years old.. Regardless I suppose things proceeded pretty peacefully after that. With minor disagreements but mostly uncomfortable vibes. Now I somewhat have forgotten the timeline but about 3 months into my mom and Blake's relationship they decide that they are going to buy a house together. It was a serious fixer-upper that honestly needed a few prayers to go along with it. They got it cheap from a family friend whose's irresponsible daughter had ""rented"" it out to some people who through years, trashed it. It was a den for revolving people to come and go as they please. Which left the house an utter mess and an eye-sore to everyone in the neighborhood. I won't go into detail of just how utterly disgusting it was but just know it took weeks of deep cleaning, in the cold, dark, house as all the radiators and lights had thoroughly broken from years of neglect. But soon enough we got the house ready to start fixing up which begun by putting in new radiators, getting them working, and setting up new temporary lighting. Finally it was a warm and somewhat bright home that just needed some extra loving. And still being in my very late teens I too moved in and got an upstairs room with an extra heating element as the radiator in that room was still a bit wonky. Some months of living through the renovation's mess, which involved knocking down several walls and ripping up the floor in the kitchen as the support beams had rotted through from water damage. It was just enough time for me and my sister to started to have more and more disagreements with Blake. Living together we'd gotten to know one another better and I did not like his behaviour. Frankly I thought he was immature, self-centred and undependable. As he would go out of his way to make everyone else's day worse just because he was having a shitty day. And if things didn't go as he wanted he would refuse to speak to anyone but still loom around like a dark cloud, sulking. Not only that but he would have verbal fights with my mother on the regular. Now I don't have the best relationship with my mom either as I have always had to play the part of being her therapy kid. Which included having to sit through her woefully details of her problems in life. And with all the frequent fights it became all she talked about. But despite my repeated advice to get her to sit down and talk to him directly about how she feels and how distressing the fights are for her she never did anything about it. As I could see how strongly she loved him, for whatever reason. I even strongly recommend that she and Blake went to seek individual therapy or a couples counselling but she always dismissed me. At one point I even asked her why she was still with him and that this relationship clearly is nothing but hurtful to her and she should leave him. Obviously I got sick of hearing about it when nothing ever changed, which soured me and my mom's relationship as well.

About a year in I started gaining weight from an increase to the medication I was taking. I had never had such a sudden weight gain before and I wasn't feeling that great about it. One morning I went downstairs for coffee. I both sweeten and take milk in my coffee as I like everything sweet and nice. But to my suprise the sugar wasn't where it usually is, so I went about searching through the kitchen for it. But nada, it was nowhere to be found. And it wasn't only the sugar, as I searched I noticed several things were missing. No honey, no candy, no chips, no biscuits, no icing sugar. Most sweet and otherwise considered unhealthy foods were just gone. All of it. And at this point in time neither my sister nor I was was on speaking terms with Blake. We didn't full out ignore him but if we could go about the day with interacting with him it was a good day. So I abandoned the idea of coffee for the time being so I could ask my mom about my discovery or lack thereof. When later I brought this up with her she looked just as confused as I must have been this morning and said she'd ask Blake about it. Towards late afternoon when I still hadn't heard anything from my mom I went and looked for her to personally ask her once more if she knew anything. And oh, she did. 

She looked almost ashamed as she started by telling me that Blake had noticed my recent weight gain. And that he had assumed the cause of it was because I'd been going and snacking out of the pantry. And since economically they didn't have the extra money to stock the pantry in excess. He had gone out of his way to hide all the aforementioned things. Without. Telling. Anyone. 
Not only did this come straight out of the blue as I had neither been asked nor even sneered at (which would be on par with his character) for my recent weight gain but he had not even discussed this with me. For if you have a problem with me I consider the only adult thing to do is to take it up with me personally. And after being told of this I flew into a blind rage. Cursing out the most colourful words his way and demanding my mom finally take a stand against his honest tyranny over this household. But to my utter astonishment my mom started making excuses for the trash of a human being her boyfriend was by saying he didn't know my weight gain was from my medication. To which I promptly said, even if it wasn't from my medication this was still the most disrespectful way he could have possibly gone about it. And proceeded to lose my shit on her as well. I will though concede that I might have been a bit more cruel than I should have been but I was beyond hurt at not only the sheer audacity of Blake but also from my mother's betrayal. I then ended it by saying that I expect an apology promptly and she was more than welcome to inform him of just that. Some hours pass and I was called downstairs to talk. Blake apologised for hiding the sugar amongst other things. It was half-hearted at best. As I explained why this was so wrong of him to do his next apology went with a ""I'm sorry you perceived it that way"" which if you ask me is no apology at all but a roundabout way of deflecting blame. Which then proceeded with him blaming me for not telling him that my weight gain was from my medications, like it was any business of his to know. And as he continued to effectively nullify his previous apologies by making excuses. I once again flew off the handle. And I can't think of a single other time in my life where I have been as mad as I was that day since or before. 

And now for some pettiness. After storming off, I spend the whole night packing. Filling 2 bags and a suitcase of anything I would need that I couldn't buy. I was so done of living with both of them and honestly couldn't stand to take more of their arguing or to argue with them. Once morning came, I called my paternal grandmother. She and my grandfather have always been a sort of safe haven for both me and my sister. Two months away from turning 18 I left home for good. Being picked up by my grandparents when both Blake and my mom were off to work. I got to live in their empty apartment whilst they always spent summers living full time out of their summer cabin.

Only before I left, I got to spend a good 4 to 5 hour in an empty house. Which I put to good use. Going around and round hiding anything they could need on an every day basis. TV remotes, WiFi cord, headphones, perfume, deodorant, toothpaste, WiFi router, shoes, keys, razors thrown out, toothbrushes thrown out, drills, screws, extra lightbulbs, batteries. Anything I could think off on the fly that would be an annoyance if it was gone. I think I even pulled out the laces from some of the shoes. I also slightly unscrewed some lightbulbs in the fixed lamps. And then I closed that door and never looked back.

Oh was it petty but it also felt so good. Especially since they kept calling even 2 months later still looking for several things and I never even gave a hint of where they could find any of it. Some stuff I even hid outside, and in furniture they had planned on throwing out. Maybe they are still missing things but I haven't heard word of it or maybe they just gave up. Hope it felt like the worst Easter hunt of their lives.

--
Sorry for the long story but I hoped you enjoyed savoring the pettiness as much as I do every single time I get to re-tell it.

Bonus info - After this little stunt and my obvious hatred towards Blake. My mother's and his relationship seemed to have hit the rocks as both daughters had cut her off from ours lives because of his behaviour. And after that whenever we were in his presence he really sucked up to us and tried to be all buddy-buddy with us. Giving us gifts, calling us his bonus daughters and insisting on paying for us when eating out.

Coffee shops used to be a place that felt ""lived in"", there were couches and ""pie of the day"". People would spend their Friday evening there with a cup of tea and a good book or eat a piece of pie with friends. Nowadays, coffee shops are very ""in and out"" or with a few people staring at their screen with headphones on. The decor is very modern and minimalistic and the seats are uncomfortable, often metal or plastic chairs.

So, why the FUCK, do we choose as the representation of the whole of this war-torn galaxy in which there is no peace or hope, which is driven by the laughter of thirsting gods, why is Grandpa-fucking-smurf and his dopey face on the cover.

Like why have him? It really sends the message that the most important aspects of this setting are the Primarchs, and him in particular. Which, given we do judge books by their covers, if you gave this to one of the many new fans that space marine 2 has brought us, lots of people will reasonably assume 'Oh, so this is a setting about the Ultramarines, and everyone else just less important narrative speaking compared to them.'

Like, I wasn't expecting my fav army to be front and center, don't worry. I know the Imperium is the main character. But like, give us something a little gothic, scary, disturbing, sad, brutal on the cover.

I’ve had the Nespresso Vertuo gifted from my boyfriend for the past two years. From a functionality perspective and convenience it is perfect in the sense where it brews a very good quality espresso shot

However, one thing I’m struggling with is making an iced vanilla latte that is on par with coffee shops (whether it be Starbucks, Dunkin, or independent chain).

I feel like I’ve tried everything and I referred to multiple recipes on social media, but I still can’t seem to nail it. I tend to use unsweetened almond milk as my milk choice as I tend to avoid dairy unless for special occasions. 

I’m just wondering on what espresso pod would be best for this(I currently am loyal to altisso), what milk brand would be best (I’ve had oat milk before but it’s bloating to me so I tend to avoid), and what syrups to use (I’ve tried monin vanilla syrup, coffee mate French vanilla creamer, torani vanilla syrup, torani white chocolate syrup, and all of these seem to have a weird aftertaste).

1g1ojxc,https://www.reddit.com/r/SavvyFridays/comments/1g1ojxc/lg_nanocell_black_friday_deal_2024/,LG NanoCell Black Friday Deal 2024,"Welcome, everyone. I hope you're having a good day. I've got some electrifying news that'll make your Black Friday even brighter. I just unearthed an absolute gem of a deal on the **LG NanoCell** TV that's been flying under the radar. If you're in the market for a visual feast, you need to [witness it firsthand](https://savvyfridays.com/deal/lg-nanocell/)!


I've been basking in the glory of my LG NanoCell for months now, and let me tell you, it's been a game-changer. The colors are so vivid, it's like someone cranked up the saturation on reality itself. I'm talking about reds that pop like fireworks and blues so deep you could dive right in. And don't even get me started on the blacks – they're darker than my coffee on a Monday morning.


What really blows my mind is the 4K resolution. I swear, sometimes I forget I'm watching TV and think I'm peering through a crystal-clear window. The other day, I was watching a nature documentary, and I could count the individual hairs on a lion's mane. It's that crisp.


But here's the kicker – the smart features are like having a tech-savvy buddy always ready to hang out. Voice control? Check. Seamless streaming? You bet. It's like the TV reads my mind, suggesting shows I didn't even know I wanted to watch.


Now, I love my current NanoCell so much that I'm seriously considering snagging another one with this deal. Maybe for the bedroom? Or perhaps I'll surprise my parents – they're still squinting at their ancient tube TV.


The sound quality deserves a standing ovation too. It's rich and immersive, making you feel like you're right in the middle of the action. Whether it's the whisper of leaves in a tense scene or the thunderous roar of an action sequence, this TV delivers.


So, if you've been on the fence about upgrading your viewing experience, now's the time to leap off. This Black Friday deal on the LG NanoCell is a rare opportunity to bring home a slice of visual paradise without breaking the bank. Trust me, your eyes (and your family movie nights) will thank you.
