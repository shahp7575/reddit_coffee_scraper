Scroll to end to see current hair. 

.

My hair has been every color under the sun. deep browns, black, balayage, multiple tones of blonde, full platinum blonde. red hues. I have naturally swollen, dry, curly hair. I have thin hair but a lot of hair so it appears very thick. My hair does better being maintained rather than allowing it to be curly so I do not have advice for curly method hair. Keeping my hair flat is the best for me. I never personally dyed my hair, it was always done by a stylist. My profile contains other things I do for my hair growth. 

.

Photos are from 2021 — current day. I dyed my hair to my natural color and started my hair growth journey. This is years of hair rehab and growth and consistency, it does not happen overnight. I have no underlying health conditions, have been on birth control my whole life, just recently in the last 6 months got off. I have had a blood test. I have never had children. These products may not work for everyone, I am not implying that if you don’t use these, your hair will not grow. But I am implying that for my personal journey, I did notice results with these products, I overall have a huge hair regiment. Hopefully this helps even one person! I understand if not everyone agrees with my methods. 

1. Probiotic. 

I’m an extreme believer in gut health for hair growth. A healthy inside creates a healthy outside. I take these religiously. Many probiotics are available on the shelf, research what works for you. 

2. Multivitamin. 

I do not take these everyday. Your body only takes what it needs from vitamins, truthfully you may be peeing out a lot of what this entails and not benefiting all that much of it. I take this once a week. 2x a week if I am working out, exhausting myself or feeling sick. There are many brands of multi-vitamins. You do not have to buy this exact one. I always take with a meal, it will upset my stomach if I take it on an empty tummy. 

3. Activia 

I’m sure any yogurt will do. These are easy for me. They are kind of expensive so please purchase something that works with your budget. I drink one every morning, religiously. 

4. Greens

Any brand will do. They don’t all taste the same. I don’t ever really love the taste of greens,  I stomach it because I truly think it helps. I know everyone has a hard time getting their vegetable intake. I drink this 1-2 a week. 

5. Cottage cheese 

I know some people HATE cottage cheese. 🧀 I get it. I mix this with my scrambled eggs or I just eat a couple bites through out the week. I love cottage cheese, I may even over eat it. So eat at your discretion. 

6. EGGS 

Love them, eat 3 every morning religiously. Great protein, easy. Eat them hard boiled, fried, scrambled.   I definitely feel I stay full and feel more awake after getting my protein in the morning. Then I don’t feel so bad if I don’t get anything super nutritious the rest of the day. I eat pretty healthy in general but everybody has days where they are way too busy and you eat whatever you can get your hands on.

7. Dollar store water bottle. 

Big jug, keep it with me 24/7 , I try to drink one whole one a day. If I drink more, great. I also ALWAYS start my day with a glass of water before my coffee. ☕️ they say you are dehydrated after sleeping for so many hours. This definitely gets my guts moving in the morning. There are some mornings where I’m craving coffee so bad, so it’s definitely hard to drink that morning glass of water, But I just do it. 

Thanks for coming to my ted talk.

I love you so much.

Everyone deserves to love their hair. 

\*\*\*\*\*No I don’t ever take biotin or hair growth supplements, i do not have input on those products, I truly think overall health is key to healthy hair growth.\*\*\*\*

That day, a revolution took place in my consciousness.
Even though I am not an artist.
If you have ever been to this place — a library disguised as a bookstore — you know it well. There is a café, a small area with tables and chairs, and the smell of coffee that drives everyone slightly mad, even those who came “just to browse.”
I took a book on English grammar and sat at a table, hiding behind the backs of people standing in line at the counter. While the aroma of coffee attacked their wallets, I avoided the barista’s gaze and opened my lunchbox — because I did not want to spend twenty dollars.
Oh Allah, save me from latte!
And at that very moment, she entered.
Tall. Stately. A lady as if she had stepped straight out of One Thousand and One Nights.
Black — deep, radiant black.
Beautiful — more beautiful than all the ladies of the world, including those from cosmetic advertisements.
I wanted to stand up, climb onto the table, and shout to all the book buyers: “Look, and remember! Beauty does not depend on skin color! Humanity has not yet put a full stop in this argument. And if it ever does — that full stop will be black!”
I barely restrained myself, afraid that I would be thrown out of the store like a philosophical hooligan.
I stood up and, pretending to be an elderly lover of books, wandered among the countless shelves.
And suddenly, from somewhere deep within the books, Jalal ad-Din Balkhi whispered to me:
“You are right. She is Layla. In Arabic, her name means Night.
She is the most beautiful.
But you are late, my friend.
We chose her long ago.”",1,1766433775.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

1pt9br2,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pt9br2/liewe_heksie/,Liewe Heksie,"I’ve heard it said, both in media and to me personally, that the only way to get over a tragedy is to confront it. In truth, I’ve never understood what that means. To me, tragedy is a scar; raw at first, but it fades until you almost forget it’s there. Until something brushes against it, and the pain flares up again.

Losing my father was my first scar. Eight years have dulled it into something I can manage. A pain I can ignore. The scar my mother left was the deepest, and still fresh. She was the kindest person I’ve ever known, and now the house she left me is unbearably quiet. Two weeks isn’t enough time for this silence to feel normal.

I don’t plan to stay here. I want this to fade as quickly as possible. I want to bury it under time before I can dwell on it. 

But first, I’ve been going through the attic; boxes of photographs, toys, and things I don’t remember owning. The place feels almost sacred: cedar beams draped in cobwebs, dust glittering in shafts of light, every box a nostalgic mystery until I open it.

I find old memories in these boxes. Drawings of my family I had scribbled as a child; poor depictions of my father with his coat and his bowtie, my mother’s long, dark hair and warm smile reduced to dark crayon smudges. And more tangible memories too; faded birthday cards in my mother’s handwriting, broken toys neatly stitched, her hand in every seam. It’s bittersweet, like watching a home movie about someone you love. Beautiful, but it hurts because you know it’s over.

But there was one box in that attic that didn’t give me this same warm, sweet sadness. This box made me itch in a way I couldn’t scratch. A memory pressing at the edges of my mind but refusing to surface. 

Placed neatly at the bottom of a collapsing cardboard box, waiting for me to find it, was an old VCR cassette. 

It’s what’s making me write this post. I’m hoping someone out there will be able to fill in some gaps for me.

I know this may be a bit of a niche ask, but does anyone know of the show, “Liewe Heksie?”

The first thing I saw was my mother’s handwriting on the box, on a yellowed strip of scotch tape:

*“All is well in Blommeland”*

Seeing it dragged me straight back to childhood like a riptide.

For those who don’t know, *Liewe Heksie* was a somewhat educational children’s program in South Africa that ran from 1978 to 1982. It began on the radio, but by the time I was a child, I knew it from the television adaptation that used puppets.

The title translates to “Beloved Little Witch,” and she was the star. Her name was Livinia, a happy but scatterbrained little witch with a pointed hat who lived in Blommeland (“Flowerland”), a painted kingdom of cardboard castles, bright flowers, and felt puppets. She went on lighthearted adventures with her fairytale friends, and could never remember the words to her own spells. It was sweet. Wholesome, even.

My mother never missed it. Even when she was busy, she’d linger in the doorway until the theme song finished.

I remember it playing on humid summer mornings, the curtains breathing in and out with the wind through open windows as the sun baked the reddish ground outside. My mother would hum softly in the kitchen while the smell of boerewors, eggs and toast drifted through the house. Hadadas shrilled from the trees outside, sometimes drowned out by the sudden drumming of rain on hot tar. I’d sit cross-legged on the carpet, tracing patterns in the weave while the TV crackled, safe in the rhythm of it all: my family, our house, the little witch chattering from her make-believe world.

My mother would often check on me, like she wanted to be sure I didn’t miss anything.

That’s the way I’ve always remembered it; warm and comfortable.

But the more I look through those boxes in the attic, the more things I find that don’t fit my rose-tinted memories. Tiny shirts and socks I know I’ve never worn. A card in my father’s handwriting addressed to “my two little ones.” A crayon drawing of a family of four holding hands.

I’m an only child.

There was one particular box that was heavier than the rest, and I already knew what it held. 

I dusted off the VCR player and coaxed it into life. The machine gave a low hum, then swallowed the cassette with a heavy clunk. My television is almost brand new, a gift from last year, but when the screen flickered from static to black, the air tingled as if I were back in front of my parents’ old box set, the ghost of its static still alive in the room.

A tiny burst of music filled the room; the Liewe Heksie intro. I hadn’t heard it in decades, but the tune was instantly familiar. And then she came into frame just like all those years ago. A happy little woman with a pointed, black hat. She smiled and waved with her friends as a choir of disembodied children’s voices sang the theme song. The puppets bobbed stiffly in time with the music, their felt mouths fixed in wide smiles.

I almost smiled too. For a moment, it was exactly how I remembered it. For those few seconds, I felt like I was sitting cross-legged on the carpet again, tracing shapes on the floor with my finger while my dad sipped his coffee.

The theme song ended and the title card flickered across the screen, its colors a little more washed out than I remembered. Then the picture steadied, and the familiar sets of Blommeland came into view; bright painted flowers and a miniature fairytale castle. It was exactly the kind of stage I used to lose myself in. Simple, happy and safe.

On his throne beside the Silver Rose sat Rosekrans, the fretful King of Blommeland. His velvet tunic bright against the backdrop, a simple gold crown perched on his head, his painted face set in its usual worried expression. He was always warning that if the Silver Rose was stolen, all the flowers in the land would die. I remembered this scene. Him ordering Heksie’s friend Blommie the elf to guard the Rose while the evil elves schemed in the shadows outside the palace.

But then his tone shifted. Heksie had asked if she could help guard the Rose too. He leaned forward, his unblinking eyes fixed on Heksie.

*“Yes, they need to be together,”* he said. *“If they’re apart, the Rose will be stolen.”*

Neither puppet reacted, just bobbing their heads obediently.

The scene carried on. The bad elves scurried and plotted, Heksie bumbled along as always, and the story moved toward its usual happy ending. But I barely followed it. I felt an unease I can’t remember feeling before. And it felt so wrong. This was a part of my childhood, how could it feel bad?

I thought about stopping the tape, but the VCR hummed steadily, and the flicker of the screen held me. By the time I’d made up my mind, the next episode had already begun.

Heksie was painting the roof of her house. The king had ordered all of Blommeland to do the same because the Fairy Queen was visiting, and he wanted everything to look beautiful for her arrival. Heksie’s friend, Blommie, was calling for her from the ground. 

But the sound changed. The tape slowed. The scene became desaturated, like the color had been muted. Blommie’s voice stretched and deepened, dragging out like something caught in the machine.

*“…wheere… are… you? …wheere… are… you?...”*

The screen jittered, then lurched forward. The sound snapped back to normal and the color came back, but several minutes of the episode were gone.

I worried the tape itself was damaged, another fragile piece of childhood about to be lost. But when I rewound the scene, it played normally.  I took it out to inspect it for damage, but I didn’t find any.

What unsettled me wasn’t the distortion itself, but how it snapped back to shape. It didn’t look like static, or like any other glitch I’d seen. It was smooth. Almost natural.

It felt less like damage and more like correction. Like something catching itself mid-fall.

I thought about popping the cassette back in, but it was late. I returned it to its bulky plastic protector, set it in the box, and went to bed.

I left it in the box that night and tried to focus on other things. Even with the morning sunlight shimmering through the windows, the house was still too quiet. Every room felt hollow without my mother’s voice filling it. I made tea just to have the sound of the kettle boiling, the hiss of steam, anything to cut through the silence.

For a while, I sat at the kitchen table paging through some old letters I’d found in another box. Most of them were boring; receipts, lists, reminders. But even in those, I could see her handwriting, careful and looping, the same way she used to write notes for me to take to school. It was comforting. I’d stumbled into a pocket of normal life that the attic hadn’t soiled yet.

Still, my mind kept wandering back to the cassette. The way the King leaned forward, the dragging voice on the roof scene. The more I told myself it was nothing, just a warped tape, just my imagination, the more it refused to leave me alone. I thought about throwing it out altogether, but the idea never made it past my hands. It was the only thing that felt like it held an answer to whatever it was that was making me feel so strange. If I watched long enough, surely things would settle back into what they were supposed to be.

That was when I noticed something else that didn’t quite fit. I couldn’t remember my mother ever keeping letters in the attic before. She used to store them downstairs, within reach, where she could keep an eye on them. She had always liked knowing where things were.

And all the while, that same elusive memory pressed harder at the edges of my mind, like it was waiting for me to turn the next page, to put the cassette back in.

The next box I opened was in shambles, its corners soft with age.Inside were scrapbooks, each page carefully labeled. Birthdays. Christmases. Holidays in Durban. It was comforting, seeing those years laid out like a timeline. I let myself believe this, at least, would look the way I remembered.

It didn’t.

In some photos, there was space where there shouldn’t have been: a gap on the couch, a chair pulled slightly too far from the table, my mother’s arms positioned in an awkward loop around the air in front of her. It was as if the film had simply forgotten what should be there. And her captions never named me. They just said things like “the kids” or “our little ones.”

The gaps weren’t empty, not really. In the older photos, there were smudges in the film. The kind of fading you’d expect after years in storage. But as the pages went on, the shapes grew darker. More defined. A tall, thin blur that clung to the edges of the frames, always just in view.

Then I turned one page and froze. Christmas. I was smiling on the floor in front of the tree, clutching a new toy. I could see the reflection of the window behind me in the glossy paper. It was faint but clear, and something was standing there with me. Too tall to be my parents. Too crooked to be a trick of the light.

My throat tightened. I slammed the scrapbook shut and shoved it aside. But the image didn’t go away with it. My body locked up and I was suddenly certain there was something behind me. There had been something there this whole time, close enough that my shoulders tensed in anticipation.

But nothing touched me.

I snapped the book closed and stood too fast, nearly knocking over the box. I pivoted back and forth, scanning the dim attic. Shapes seemed to shift in the corners, shadows clinging to the beams, crouching among the spider webs. The air felt too close, too heavy, the dust swirling like it had been stirred by something.

Nothing was here.

I stood there anyway, heart pounding, until the feeling ebbed. Until the attic was just an attic again.

But even as I tried to convince myself, my hands kept drifting toward the box. The cassette had been lodged in my thoughts since I found it, like a song I couldn’t stop humming.

And of course, I went back to it, scrapbook tucked under my arm.

I let the cassette play on, half-watching as episodes blurred together; three, four, five, all the way through eleven. They were just as I remembered them: clumsy adventures, Heksie bungling her way through spells, Blommie sighing in exasperation. Nothing was out of place.

By the time the twelfth episode began, my guard had dropped.

Heksie was gardening - planting her flowers upside down by mistake. Kwaaitjie laughed at her before asking her for a favor. He was tasked with delivering a message for the king and needed Heksie to look after his baby brother. I remember this episode vaguely.

But not the child. Small, with oversized felt hands and a round face. I had no memory of this puppet, let alone in this episode. I could have sworn Heksie was supposed to help deliver messages with Kwaaitjie with her broom.

Heksie tucked him into bed, singing him an off-key lullaby while the child doll closed its stiff eyelids. 

When Heksie wandered off and forgot about him, I felt a flicker of unease. She went to Blommie’s house who scolded her for forgetting her responsibility. They hurried back to find an empty bed. 

I felt the blood leave my face, but I had no idea why my body was reacting this way.

The scene jumped abruptly to Heksie flying through painted skies, calling in a voice far too angry for her character, 

“Where are you? You must come out now.”

The call carried none of her usual playfulness, it sounded like an order.

 And though she was looking offstage, it felt like her glassy eyes were fixed on me.

When the child was “found,” tucked safe in another room, the mood shifted back to its usual happiness. He had never left the bed, Heksie had simply checked the wrong room. 

As the explanation settled, the jitter smoothed out. The colors brightened again. Only at the edge of the frame did the darkness remain, thin and patient, as if it had always been there and now no longer needed to hide.

When the king asked Heksie what had caused the commotion that day, her voice was distorted and drawn out,

“We forgot.”

The word settled heavily, and the room felt finished with it.

That feeling of unreachable nostalgia had never been stronger, as if my thoughts were locked behind iron bars. I flipped through the scrapbook, faster now, as if momentum might force something loose.

Every picture told the same story. My father holding me. My mother beside us. And always the same wrongness. Her arms curved around empty space. 

I turned the pages until they blurred together, until my eyes grew heavy with the strain of reaching for something just out of reach.

At some point, I must have dozed off at the table, the scrapbook still open beneath my arm. My dream felt softer than usual, like it was illuminated by the same pastel skyline I had been staring at on the television.

My father was there. Whole, as I remembered him before the accident. I could even smell the aftershave he used. It was one of my favorite memories of him. The day he taught me to throw a rugby ball. We passed it back and forth until I learned how to spiral it through the air. I remember the pride and love so clearly visible on his face. For a while, I believed it. Believed I was really in this moment again.

Then the sky dimmed.

Not all at once, just enough that the colors thinned, the edges of the scene losing their certainty. My father’s features blurred next, smudging at the corners as if the dream could no longer hold him together. His words cut off mid-breath, breaking into silence.

Something remained in the background where the horizon had been. Tall and thin. Not moving closer, but filling the space the scene had lost.

I tried to reach for him, to see his face again, but the effort only made the image falter further.

I was jolted awake by singing. I was back in the chair with the scrapbook, the TV screen illuminating the room and greeting me with this;

Video. 

I sat up and reached for the remote to turn it off, but the scrapbook slid off my lap, pages spilling open across the floor. The Liewe Heksie intro blared in the dark room, bright and cheerful, impossibly loud in the quiet house.

I stared down at the open pages.

My father’s photo, the one I had studied only hours earlier, was ruined. He was unrecognizable, his face just a pale blur on the yellowed page.

It struck me then that the dream hadn’t ended when I woke up.

It had finished. Something had been taken, and the space it left was already closing.

The next episode loaded on its own.

*Liewe Heksie’s Birthday.*

Heksie was seated at the end of a long table, surrounded by kabouters in paper hats, their voices raised in song. A cake sat between them adorned with brightly colored wax candles. But it wasn’t her celebration.

When the singing ended, she began to cry, the puppet wiping its own painted eyes. When Blommie asked her what was wrong she admitted she’d never had a birthday of her own. She didn’t know when she’d been born. Her friend pitied her, and came up with a plan.

Birthdays were important. Everyone knew that in Blommeland.

After some murmuring, he suggested she could simply choose one. Heksie considered this for a while before announcing happily that her birthday party would be April 24th, and everyone was invited.

Once everyone agreed, the mood lifted. A cake was brought back out. Presents were handed over. The disruption smoothed itself away.

For a moment, I felt that nostalgic childhood warmth again.

When the day came, there was a party. Gifts, cake, laughter. Heksie was radiant.

It wasn’t until she mentioned having another birthday the following week that the confusion set in. Voices rose. Someone said that wasn’t how birthdays worked. Others pointed out the gifts, the cake, the trouble they’d gone to, and how Heksie had tricked them by lying about her birthday.

The presents were taken back. The celebration collapsed into something brittle and awkward.

I remembered this part.

Karl Cat was supposed to defend Heksie. He would tell the crowd that witches have the special ability to choose when their birthday is. The music was supposed to swell then, light and apologetic, ushering the scene toward its lesson. The kabouters would forgive her, and the party would resume as the credits rolled. That was how the episode went.

But none of that happened. The music didn’t pick up, the argument didn’t go on.

One moment the kabouters were still standing there, hands hovering over reclaimed gifts, and the next they were already sitting down. The presents were back on the table. The cake was centered again, candles straightened. No one acknowledged the change.

The scene held longer than it should have.

Heksie sat smiling at the table, dark hair framing her painted face. Karl Cat was beside her, his red bowtie neatly fixed. Across from them, a smaller figure clutched a stuffed bear, feet not quite reaching the floor.

They sat exactly as the scene required, arranged with the same care as the table and the cake.

Every seat at the table was filled. All but one.

An empty wooden chair, pulled slightly back, as if waiting for someone who hadn’t arrived yet.

And suddenly the touch I’d imagined earlier in the attic wasn’t a threat at all.

For weeks I had been struggling to remember, and this felt familiar. 

The scene wasn’t waiting for me to understand. My struggling hadn’t been the point. Remembering or understanding wasn’t the point. It was waiting for me to agree.

I realized my own hands were clenched in my lap as my eyes moved from the screen to the box that had started this. To the tape on the box that my mother had so meticulously placed all those years ago.

In her neat handwriting,

*“All is well in Blommeland.”*

I stared at it for a long time.

It was not reassurance, nor was it even kindness. This was a rule, a contract, and I had followed it to the letter without realizing it.

Nothing was wrong in Blommeland.

Nothing was allowed to be.",1,1766433581.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1pt9a52,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1pt9a52/liewe_heksie/,Liewe Heksie,"I’ve heard it said, both in media and to me personally, that the only way to get over a tragedy is to confront it. In truth, I’ve never understood what that means. To me, tragedy is a scar; raw at first, but it fades until you almost forget it’s there. Until something brushes against it, and the pain flares up again.

Losing my father was my first scar. Eight years have dulled it into something I can manage. A pain I can ignore. The scar my mother left was the deepest, and still fresh. She was the kindest person I’ve ever known, and now the house she left me is unbearably quiet. Two weeks isn’t enough time for this silence to feel normal.

I don’t plan to stay here. I want this to fade as quickly as possible. I want to bury it under time before I can dwell on it. 

But first, I’ve been going through the attic; boxes of photographs, toys, and things I don’t remember owning. The place feels almost sacred: cedar beams draped in cobwebs, dust glittering in shafts of light, every box a nostalgic mystery until I open it.

I find old memories in these boxes. Drawings of my family I had scribbled as a child; poor depictions of my father with his coat and his bowtie, my mother’s long, dark hair and warm smile reduced to dark crayon smudges. And more tangible memories too; faded birthday cards in my mother’s handwriting, broken toys neatly stitched, her hand in every seam. It’s bittersweet, like watching a home movie about someone you love. Beautiful, but it hurts because you know it’s over.

But there was one box in that attic that didn’t give me this same warm, sweet sadness. This box made me itch in a way I couldn’t scratch. A memory pressing at the edges of my mind but refusing to surface. 

Placed neatly at the bottom of a collapsing cardboard box, waiting for me to find it, was an old VCR cassette. 

It’s what’s making me write this post. I’m hoping someone out there will be able to fill in some gaps for me.

I know this may be a bit of a niche ask, but does anyone know of the show, “Liewe Heksie?”

The first thing I saw was my mother’s handwriting on the box, on a yellowed strip of scotch tape:

*“All is well in Blommeland”*

 Seeing it dragged me straight back to childhood like a riptide.

For those who don’t know, *Liewe Heksie* was a somewhat educational children’s program in South Africa that ran from 1978 to 1982. It began on the radio, but by the time I was a child, I knew it from the television adaptation that used puppets.

The title translates to “Beloved Little Witch,” and she was the star. Her name was Livinia, a happy but scatterbrained little witch with a pointed hat who lived in Blommeland (“Flowerland”), a painted kingdom of cardboard castles, bright flowers, and felt puppets. She went on lighthearted adventures with her fairytale friends, and could never remember the words to her own spells. It was sweet. Wholesome, even.

My mother never missed it. Even when she was busy, she’d linger in the doorway until the theme song finished.

I remember it playing on humid summer mornings, the curtains breathing in and out with the wind through open windows as the sun baked the reddish ground outside. My mother would hum softly in the kitchen while the smell of boerewors, eggs and toast drifted through the house. Hadadas shrilled from the trees outside, sometimes drowned out by the sudden drumming of rain on hot tar. I’d sit cross-legged on the carpet, tracing patterns in the weave while the TV crackled, safe in the rhythm of it all: my family, our house, the little witch chattering from her make-believe world.

My mother would often check on me, like she wanted to be sure I didn’t miss anything.

That’s the way I’ve always remembered it; warm and comfortable.

But the more I look through those boxes in the attic, the more things I find that don’t fit my rose-tinted memories. Tiny shirts and socks I know I’ve never worn. A card in my father’s handwriting addressed to “my two little ones.” A crayon drawing of a family of four holding hands.

I’m an only child.

There was one particular box that was heavier than the rest, and I already knew what it held. 

I dusted off the VCR player and coaxed it into life. The machine gave a low hum, then swallowed the cassette with a heavy clunk. My television is almost brand new, a gift from last year, but when the screen flickered from static to black, the air tingled as if I were back in front of my parents’ old box set, the ghost of its static still alive in the room.

A tiny burst of music filled the room; the Liewe Heksie intro. I hadn’t heard it in decades, but the tune was instantly familiar. And then she came into frame just like all those years ago. A happy little woman with a pointed, black hat. She smiled and waved with her friends as a choir of disembodied children’s voices sang the theme song. The puppets bobbed stiffly in time with the music, their felt mouths fixed in wide smiles.

I almost smiled too. For a moment, it was exactly how I remembered it. For those few seconds, I felt like I was sitting cross-legged on the carpet again, tracing shapes on the floor with my finger while my dad sipped his coffee.

The theme song ended and the title card flickered across the screen, its colors a little more washed out than I remembered. Then the picture steadied, and the familiar sets of Blommeland came into view; bright painted flowers and a miniature fairytale castle. It was exactly the kind of stage I used to lose myself in. Simple, happy and safe.

On his throne beside the Silver Rose sat Rosekrans, the fretful King of Blommeland. His velvet tunic bright against the backdrop, a simple gold crown perched on his head, his painted face set in its usual worried expression. He was always warning that if the Silver Rose was stolen, all the flowers in the land would die. I remembered this scene. Him ordering Heksie’s friend Blommie the elf to guard the Rose while the evil elves schemed in the shadows outside the palace.

But then his tone shifted. Heksie had asked if she could help guard the Rose too. He leaned forward, his unblinking eyes fixed on Heksie.

*“Yes, they need to be together,”* he said. *“If they’re apart, the Rose will be stolen.”*

Neither puppet reacted, just bobbing their heads obediently.

The scene carried on. The bad elves scurried and plotted, Heksie bumbled along as always, and the story moved toward its usual happy ending. But I barely followed it. I felt an unease I can’t remember feeling before. And it felt so wrong. This was a part of my childhood, how could it feel bad?

I thought about stopping the tape, but the VCR hummed steadily, and the flicker of the screen held me. By the time I’d made up my mind, the next episode had already begun.

Heksie was painting the roof of her house. The king had ordered all of Blommeland to do the same because the Fairy Queen was visiting, and he wanted everything to look beautiful for her arrival. Heksie’s friend, Blommie, was calling for her from the ground. 

But the sound changed. The tape slowed. The scene became desaturated, like the color had been muted. Blommie’s voice stretched and deepened, dragging out like something caught in the machine.

*“…wheere… are… you? …wheere… are… you?...”*

The screen jittered, then lurched forward. The sound snapped back to normal and the color came back, but several minutes of the episode were gone.

I worried the tape itself was damaged, another fragile piece of childhood about to be lost. But when I rewound the scene, it played normally.  I took it out to inspect it for damage, but I didn’t find any.

What unsettled me wasn’t the distortion itself, but how it snapped back to shape. It didn’t look like static, or like any other glitch I’d seen. It was smooth. Almost natural.

It felt less like damage and more like correction. Like something catching itself mid-fall.

I thought about popping the cassette back in, but it was late. I returned it to its bulky plastic protector, set it in the box, and went to bed.

I left it in the box that night and tried to focus on other things. Even with the morning sunlight shimmering through the windows, the house was still too quiet. Every room felt hollow without my mother’s voice filling it. I made tea just to have the sound of the kettle boiling, the hiss of steam, anything to cut through the silence.

For a while, I sat at the kitchen table paging through some old letters I’d found in another box. Most of them were boring; receipts, lists, reminders. But even in those, I could see her handwriting, careful and looping, the same way she used to write notes for me to take to school. It was comforting. I’d stumbled into a pocket of normal life that the attic hadn’t soiled yet.

Still, my mind kept wandering back to the cassette. The way the King leaned forward, the dragging voice on the roof scene. The more I told myself it was nothing, just a warped tape, just my imagination, the more it refused to leave me alone. I thought about throwing it out altogether, but the idea never made it past my hands. It was the only thing that felt like it held an answer to whatever it was that was making me feel so strange. If I watched long enough, surely things would settle back into what they were supposed to be.

That was when I noticed something else that didn’t quite fit. I couldn’t remember my mother ever keeping letters in the attic before. She used to store them downstairs, within reach, where she could keep an eye on them. She had always liked knowing where things were.

And all the while, that same elusive memory pressed harder at the edges of my mind, like it was waiting for me to turn the next page, to put the cassette back in.

The next box I opened was in shambles, its corners soft with age.Inside were scrapbooks, each page carefully labeled. Birthdays. Christmases. Holidays in Durban. It was comforting, seeing those years laid out like a timeline. I let myself believe this, at least, would look the way I remembered.

It didn’t.

In some photos, there was space where there shouldn’t have been: a gap on the couch, a chair pulled slightly too far from the table, my mother’s arms positioned in an awkward loop around the air in front of her. It was as if the film had simply forgotten what should be there. And her captions never named me. They just said things like “the kids” or “our little ones.”

The gaps weren’t empty, not really. In the older photos, there were smudges in the film. The kind of fading you’d expect after years in storage. But as the pages went on, the shapes grew darker. More defined. A tall, thin blur that clung to the edges of the frames, always just in view.

Then I turned one page and froze. Christmas. I was smiling on the floor in front of the tree, clutching a new toy. I could see the reflection of the window behind me in the glossy paper. It was faint but clear, and something was standing there with me. Too tall to be my parents. Too crooked to be a trick of the light.

My throat tightened. I slammed the scrapbook shut and shoved it aside. But the image didn’t go away with it. My body locked up and I was suddenly certain there was something behind me. There had been something there this whole time, close enough that my shoulders tensed in anticipation.

But nothing touched me.

I snapped the book closed and stood too fast, nearly knocking over the box. I pivoted back and forth, scanning the dim attic. Shapes seemed to shift in the corners, shadows clinging to the beams, crouching among the spider webs. The air felt too close, too heavy, the dust swirling like it had been stirred by something.

Nothing was here.

I stood there anyway, heart pounding, until the feeling ebbed. Until the attic was just an attic again.

But even as I tried to convince myself, my hands kept drifting toward the box. The cassette had been lodged in my thoughts since I found it, like a song I couldn’t stop humming.

And of course, I went back to it, scrapbook tucked under my arm.

I let the cassette play on, half-watching as episodes blurred together; three, four, five, all the way through eleven. They were just as I remembered them: clumsy adventures, Heksie bungling her way through spells, Blommie sighing in exasperation. Nothing was out of place.

By the time the twelfth episode began, my guard had dropped.

Heksie was gardening - planting her flowers upside down by mistake. Kwaaitjie laughed at her before asking her for a favor. He was tasked with delivering a message for the king and needed Heksie to look after his baby brother. I remember this episode vaguely.

But not the child. Small, with oversized felt hands and a round face. I had no memory of this puppet, let alone in this episode. I could have sworn Heksie was supposed to help deliver messages with Kwaaitjie with her broom.

Heksie tucked him into bed, singing him an off-key lullaby while the child doll closed its stiff eyelids. 

When Heksie wandered off and forgot about him, I felt a flicker of unease. She went to Blommie’s house who scolded her for forgetting her responsibility. They hurried back to find an empty bed. 

I felt the blood leave my face, but I had no idea why my body was reacting this way.

The scene jumped abruptly to Heksie flying through painted skies, calling in a voice far too angry for her character, 

“Where are you? You must come out now.”

The call carried none of her usual playfulness, it sounded like an order.

 And though she was looking offstage, it felt like her glassy eyes were fixed on me.

When the child was “found,” tucked safe in another room, the mood shifted back to its usual happiness. He had never left the bed, Heksie had simply checked the wrong room. 

As the explanation settled, the jitter smoothed out. The colors brightened again. Only at the edge of the frame did the darkness remain, thin and patient, as if it had always been there and now no longer needed to hide.

When the king asked Heksie what had caused the commotion that day, her voice was distorted and drawn out,

“We forgot.”

The word settled heavily, and the room felt finished with it.

That feeling of unreachable nostalgia had never been stronger, as if my thoughts were locked behind iron bars. I flipped through the scrapbook, faster now, as if momentum might force something loose.

Every picture told the same story. My father holding me. My mother beside us. And always the same wrongness. Her arms curved around empty space. 

I turned the pages until they blurred together, until my eyes grew heavy with the strain of reaching for something just out of reach.

At some point, I must have dozed off at the table, the scrapbook still open beneath my arm. My dream felt softer than usual, like it was illuminated by the same pastel skyline I had been staring at on the television.

My father was there. Whole, as I remembered him before the accident. I could even smell the aftershave he used. It was one of my favorite memories of him. The day he taught me to throw a rugby ball. We passed it back and forth until I learned how to spiral it through the air. I remember the pride and love so clearly visible on his face. For a while, I believed it. Believed I was really in this moment again.

Then the sky dimmed.

Not all at once, just enough that the colors thinned, the edges of the scene losing their certainty. My father’s features blurred next, smudging at the corners as if the dream could no longer hold him together. His words cut off mid-breath, breaking into silence.

Something remained in the background where the horizon had been. Tall and thin. Not moving closer, but filling the space the scene had lost.

I tried to reach for him, to see his face again, but the effort only made the image falter further.

I was jolted awake by singing. I was back in the chair with the scrapbook, the TV screen illuminating the room. The file attached is what greeted me when I woke.

I sat up and reached for the remote to turn it off, but the scrapbook slid off my lap, pages spilling open across the floor. The Liewe Heksie intro blared in the dark room, bright and cheerful, impossibly loud in the quiet house.

I stared down at the open pages.

My father’s photo, the one I had studied only hours earlier, was ruined. He was unrecognizable, his face just a pale blur on the yellowed page.

It struck me then that the dream hadn’t ended when I woke up.

It had finished. Something had been taken, and the space it left was already closing.

The next episode loaded on its own.

*Liewe Heksie’s Birthday.*

Heksie was seated at the end of a small table, surrounded by kabouters in paper hats, their voices raised in song. A cake sat between them adorned with brightly colored streamers and balloons.

https://preview.redd.it/atig7cyf9t8g1.png?width=526&format=png&auto=webp&s=637ec5ded87e417b9fc16f552c67a26217e35c81

It was a happy scene, but it wasn’t her celebration.

When the singing ended, she began to cry, the puppet wiping its own painted eyes. When Blommie asked her what was wrong she admitted she’d never had a birthday of her own. She didn’t know when she’d been born. Her friend pitied her, and came up with a plan.

Birthdays were important. Everyone knew that in Blommeland.

After some murmuring, he suggested she could simply choose one. Heksie considered this for a while before announcing happily that her birthday party would be April 24th, and everyone was invited.

Once everyone agreed, the mood lifted. A cake was brought back out. Presents were handed over. The disruption smoothed itself away.

For a moment, I felt that nostalgic childhood warmth again.

When the day came, there was a party. Gifts, cake, laughter. Heksie was radiant.

It wasn’t until she mentioned having another birthday the following week that the confusion set in. Voices rose. Someone said that wasn’t how birthdays worked. Others pointed out the gifts, the cake, the trouble they’d gone to, and how Heksie had tricked them by lying about her birthday.

The presents were taken back. The celebration collapsed into something brittle and awkward.

I remembered this part.

Karl Cat was supposed to defend Heksie. He would tell the crowd that witches have the special ability to choose when their birthday is. The music was supposed to swell then, light and apologetic, ushering the scene toward its lesson. The kabouters would forgive her, and the party would resume as the credits rolled. That was how the episode went.

But none of that happened. The music didn’t pick up, the argument didn’t go on.

One moment the kabouters were still standing there, hands hovering over reclaimed gifts, and the next they were already sitting down. The presents were back on the table. The cake was centered again, candles straightened. No one acknowledged the change.

The scene held longer than it should have.

Heksie sat smiling at the table, dark hair framing her painted face. Karl Cat was beside her, his red bowtie neatly fixed. Across from them, a smaller figure clutched a stuffed bear, feet not quite reaching the floor.

They sat exactly as the scene required, arranged with the same care as the table and the cake.

Every seat at the table was filled. All but one.

An empty wooden chair, pulled slightly back, as if waiting for someone who hadn’t arrived yet.

And suddenly the touch I’d imagined earlier in the attic wasn’t a threat at all.

For weeks I had been struggling to remember, and this felt familiar. 

The scene wasn’t waiting for me to understand. My struggling hadn’t been the point. Remembering or understanding wasn’t the point. It was waiting for me to agree.

I realized my own hands were clenched in my lap as my eyes moved from the screen to the box that had started this. To the tape on the box that my mother had so meticulously placed all those years ago.

In her neat handwriting,

*“All is well in Blommeland.”*

I stared at it for a long time.

It was not reassurance, nor was it even kindness. This was a rule, a contract, and I had followed it to the letter without realizing it.

Nothing was wrong in Blommeland.

Nothing was allowed to be.

1pt92ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/PakistaniTwenties/comments/1pt92ms/the_cage_i_built_myself/,The Cage I Built Myself,"It’s 12 AM. The kind of quiet that feels loud.

I keep writing the same line down, like if I write it enough times it’ll make sense.
A man haunted by shadows, swallowed by his own will.
But the shadows aren’t under the bed.They’re in the room. They’re in me.

I think the shadows are all the people who were supposed to be landmarks. The ones you’re told to build your map around. But what if they move? What if they were never where the map said they were? You spend years walking in what you think is the right direction, holding a compass that points to a north that doesn’t exist. Then one day you look up and you’re alone in a field you don’t recognize. No path back. No path forward. Just you, and the wrong map in your hands.

And your will. That’s the worst trick.
Your will is the engine.It’s the thing that says “keep walking.” It’s the voice that says “build something, be something, so this emptiness means something.” So you do. You build a person. You build plans. You build a future out of sheer want.
You use your will like bricks.You think you’re building a house.
But you were just building a cage around that empty field.
The will that was supposed to save you becomes the bars.You become the guard and the prisoner. You swallow the key yourself.

You meet someone in the next field over. They’re building too. You think you recognise the blueprint. You hand them some of your bricks. You work on the same wall for a while. It feels less lonely. For a second, the cage door feels open.
Then you turn around and the wall you built together is a wall between you.They have your bricks. You have your empty hands. And the lock on your cage clicks shut, tighter than before.

That’s the feeling. That’s the deep tired.
It’s not a sleep tired.It’s a soul-tired.
It’s the fatigue of being your own architect,your own builder, your own wrecking ball, and your own night watchman, all at once.
It’s looking at your own life like it’s a construction site after everyone’s gone home.The tools are rusty. The coffee’s cold. The blueprint is blowing away in the wind. And you’re just standing there, wondering what you were even trying to build, and why you’re the only one left holding the hammer.

The hollowness isn’t about being empty. It’s about being full of echoes.
Echoes of promises you heard.
Echoes of promises you made to yourself.
Echoes of the person you thought you’d be by now.
They all bounce around in the space where trust was supposed to go.It’s not quiet in here. It’s deafening.

I feel like a loser sometimes. But not because I lost a game.
Because I was playing a game I didn’t know the rules to,on a field that wasn’t mine, for a team that left at halftime. And I’m still here, in the mud, because I don’t know how to walk off the field. The stands are empty. The lights are off. But I’m still playing.

Maybe that’s all it is.
Maybe some of us are just born with a missing manual.We spend our lives trying to assemble the furniture of our life with the wrong tools, following pictures that don’t match the pieces we have in the box.

It’s a heavy, simple thing.
To realise you have to be your own parent,your own friend, your own foundation, and your own home.
To realise the only person you can truly,completely rely on is the same person you’re sometimes so tired of being.

I don’t have an answer. I just have the 12 AM quiet, this cold cup of coffee, and a page that holds the words my mouth can’t say.

Does anyone else ever feel like this? Just...completely alone in building your own life? Does the quiet ever get so loud for you?

We are in our early 20s, software guys, and generally decent human beings. But apparently, walking into an arcade or a nice café as three guys is considered a security threat in this city.

We recently graduated, and we’re suffering from severe ""University Withdrawal Symptoms."" We miss the mixed-group dynamic where you could just hang out without looking like you’re plotting a heist.

We have the jobs. We have the weekends off.  But we have zero female friends in Lahore, which means lots of the fun places are off-limits to us.

We are looking for a group of girls (2-3) who:

1. Are tired of their current routine.
2. Want to form a new squad for weekends.
3. Want to try new hobbies/activities or explore new places

**What we bring to the table:**

* **Videogames:** We are competitive, but we will accept defeat gracefully if you are faster.
* **Movies:** We promise not to explain the plot while the movie is playing.
* **Food:** We are willing to go to the ends of Androon (or just to Wagah border) for good food.
* **Conversations:** We can talk about everything from memes to aliens to why Lahore traffic is a simulation.
* **Safety:** We are strictly looking for platonic friends to hang out with. We have enough guy friends (too many, honestly), so we just want to balance the ratio.

If you have a group of friends and think it would be fun to merge groups for a bowling match, a movie, or just roasting each other over coffee, hit me up!

1pt8zgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/unmedicatedbirth/comments/1pt8zgl/positive_unmedicated_hospital_birth_went_into/,"Positive, unmedicated hospital birth. Went into labor on my own for the first time (4th baby)","hello! wanted to share my birth story as encouragement to anyone who has gone super late with previous babies, or if you’re late now and need to know, your baby WILL come. 

my first baby was only 5 days overdue when i elected to get induced out of impatience to meet her lol. I was young and naive, didn’t do any research on anything and just assumed if i had the will to do it unmedicated, i could. well it was a lot harder than I thought. I did end up getting an epidural, baby was struggling to get out and was born via forceps and I suffered a 3rd degree tear 😵‍💫

Second baby I didn’t do any research on unmedicated birth and just resigned to getting induced at 40+3 and got an epidural right away. Her birth went much better, no forceps, she was an easy delivery!

my third I finally got serious about wanting to do it unmedicated after my sister has her first and did it unmedicated, despite being induced at 41 weeks. it was for slightly competitive reasons haha. Couldn’t let my little sister outdo me in toughness 🤪 

finally read about how to birth unmedicated and was determined to wait for the baby to come on their own. Well at 41+5 days after a membrane sweep and doing everything I could to get labor to start, I decided to call it because my daughter was in the nutcracker that weekend and I really did not need to have the ticking time bomb that was me possibly going into labor while she was  a pretty serious performance 🫠

since the baby was so low my midwife gave me the option of breaking my water to get the process going. That worked and literally 4 hours later he was born. His birth was easy despite my water being broken. 

on my fourth (maybe last 😅) I have one last thing to check off my “birth wish list” and that is to go into spontaneous labor. But also knowing how long I went with my third, I was starting to wonder if I had the stamina to wait that long again. Especially with Christmas coming up. I was doing a lot to try to get things going. Miles circuit, keeping active, having sex every day 🤪🫠 I did not do dates or raspberry leaf tea. I had done dates with my last one. Didn’t find it to be very effective obviously lol. 

my due date came and went and I went to my 40 week apt at 40+2. I had been checked at my 39 week apt and my cervix were two far back to do a sweep. I was bummed because even if it doesn’t work it can at least get things to start happening. I was still not very dilated but my midwife was able to strip my membrane. That was on Tuesday. I went home, did a miles circuit and got some cleaning done. Wednesday I cleaned my floors, still felt fine but had a lot of bloody show that day. 

Thursday morning at 3:45, I wake up with a crampy contraction. I’m pretty much in major denial that I’ll ever go into spontaneous labor so I assume I’ll have a few and it will fizzle. But couldn’t go back to sleep with them coming every 10 min or so. In another hour there about 5-7 min apart. I’m sure once I get up they’ll stop. I wait another hour and decide to give my mom a heads up that maybe she should head over. 

I decided to get up and see what happens, if they go away or not. I woke up my husband too, let him know it might be baby time 😄 well they actually started getting closer together. 3-5 min apart. I ate some breakfast and started getting last min things in my bag, called my midwife to let her know what was going on. She said to go once im ready and get the antibiotics since I’m GBS positive. 

once my mom arrived we left for the hospital. the contractions slowed down big time and by the time I was in the room they had stopped 🫠 I was like, of course. but now that we’re here I’m just like we’re gonna do this today 😅 my nurse got my line placed and also the Bluetooth monitor (highly recommended these instead of the bands). She said I was having contractions every 2 minutes and I was like really? I feel nothing. Also I was like 2 cm dilated 🫠🫠🫠 (1cm in the front, 2 in the back of my cervix because I have a lip. more fun with that later lol)

once I was all set, my husband had gone out for some coffee for me, we’re just hanging out with what I feel like is totally stalled labor, they start to pick up again. I know sometimes your body stops labor when it’s not sure if you’re in a safe place to give birth. I guess it decided all was fine to proceed 😄 really glad about that! 

contractions were super manageable and about one min apart. I was progressing but pretty slowly. It might not come as a surprise at this point, that I’m rather impatient. Around 3:30 pm I was ready to kick into high gear and be done so I asked my midwife to break my water. That did the trick, contractions started to absolutely stop me when they rolled in. I would lean over and make a low hum to help relax my pelvic floor. 

i wanted to get myself in a more comfortable position so laid on my side on the bed with the peanut propping my leg up as high towards my chest as possible (Miles circuit second position). 

contractions are brutal at this point and I’m at the point of thinking “I don’t want to do this anymore” and thinking about how nice an epidural would be but also knowing it ain’t gonna happen because the actual thought of getting a shot in my back right now sounds worse than just enduring. Also once it feels unbearable, that means the end is near. 

I got up one more time since I wasn’t feeling shaky yet to let gravity bring Baby down, but pretty quickly went back to the laying position. Get checked and was at an 7/8, having issues with the lip. My nurse had me get on all fours and do a couple contractions like that while she reached in to see if she could help move it out of the way. By now I start to bear down and she calls my midwife.

i was super shaky at this point, which I know from previous births that I’m almost done. But ugh the feeling of the baby between my legs was just awful lol. I was like this kid needs to be out 😵‍💫 so when my midwife came I started pushing because I needed to get her past that lip that was still not quite complete. 

I pushed for (nurse says less than 10 min) it felt longer lol. Like I just felt like I wasn’t gonna get baby out. But with all the force I could muster and a lot of yelling and screaming, I got her out. I felt everything down there ugh. I just don’t remember it being that brutal with My third birth lol. My husband said the same from his vantage point Haha. But we met our baby girl who cried instantly (also pooped instantly but thankfully she was out when she did that 🤪 no diaper on her though so it was a bit of a mess). We had the gender be a surprise, but I was pretty sure she was a girl the whole pregnancy 😄 also she was a little peanut at only 6 lbs 14 oz!

Then, before I got into a relationship, the last time we saw each other was in February. Now, after my relationship ended with that other person, me and her have started talking again, we talked about Halloween since it was that time of the year, she then asked me how's my relationship going, then after about 30min talking about how I'm not with that person anymore she said that we should go out for a coffee since we haven't seen eachother in so long.
She kept rescheduling for the next week every time, and then I randomly get a message from her at about 8pm asking me what I'm doing and asking if we could go out for coffee right now, we went out and it was nice, we hung out from like 9pm to after midnight, I paid for her coffee and she said that next time she'll pay for mine, and then I walked her to her apartment building. As of lately though, her reply times are like every six hours, or she replies in a few minutes. We were supposed to go out this past friday, but she said she was already somewhere and is gonna get home late, then I asked her again if she's gonna come and then she said that she has a headache and she'd like to go out this next week. Today I have asked her when she would want to go out this week, I am still waiting on a reply about 6 hours later.

I recently bought a glass jar that I love, it's a great size for both carrying my overnight oats and for fitting comfortably inside my bag without taking up too much space and while being relatively protected (I put it inside of a hand washcloth, both to protect it a bit from bumps and to minimise the mess if it does end up breaking). I went back to the store to buy a second one---they no longer sell this specific type of jar, they only sell one that carries less volume or one that is taller.

I recently also bought a travel coffee cup, I wanted to buy another one---they no longer sell the cup I bought earlier, they now only sell one that carries less volume and that appears to be entirely made out of plastic.

I wanted to buy a coffee machine, so that I could start making my own (iced) coffee instead of buying iced coffee at the grocery store. I selected a coffeemaker that was affordable while also doing what I wanted it to do. I had to wait a week for my weekly budget to reset and also to avoid impulse purchases. At some point during this week, they had pulled this coffee machine out of stock. 

These things are at the top of my mind right now, can't think of other examples rn. But besides being very annoying, this has also made me kind of anxious, it has caused me to worry that if I want something I should buy it asap before it gets pulled out of stock (this is not something I want to do, and I think I will be able to avoid doing this, but it *is* now another thought around consumption that I have to fight.

1pt8wxs,https://v.redd.it/2e0en6ox6t8g1,"2025 Wrapped for the MPYAA, a nonprofit for young adults in southern Brooklyn","2025 was a year of growth, service, and community building beyond what we imagined. What began in June 2024 as an idea to create something that didn’t quite exist in southern Brooklyn — a space where young adults (18-35) could meet new people and feel part of something bigger — has grown into a thriving community.

In February, we kicked off the year with a winter coat drive at Marine Park Coffee, collecting over 100 coats, scarves, gloves, and boots for Community Heartbeat Foundation to support survivors of domestic violence across southern Brooklyn. In May, we followed with a second drive collecting essential items. By August, more than 20 volunteers packed over 100 backpacks for children impacted by domestic violence.

Alongside our service work, the Association continued to grow internally. We now have 22 registered members, a formal membership structure, adopted bylaws, and shared decision-making processes that guide how we operate. Climate Cafe South Brooklyn operates under the Marine Park Young Adults Association as a DBA, advancing our social welfare mission through facilitated, nonpartisan conversations on climate change.

Throughout the year, we hosted social and community events that brought young adults together from across southern Brooklyn. From movie nights and game nights to trivia, karaoke, concerts, volunteer drives, and casual meetups, our goal has been to create welcoming, low-pressure spaces where people can connect.

Our open community events also brought people of all ages together, including Live Music at the Gather Inn Again in April and October and a free outdoor Movie Night at the Lott House.

In November, over 30 volunteers joined us for Marine Park Street Tree Care Day with NYC Parks, caring for more than 20 street trees, with a Part II planned for next year.

We’re grateful to our local partners: Nick Grasso of Marine Park Coffee, Jaime DeNardo of The Gather Inn Again, and Jane Carbonaro for their support.

As we reflect on the year, we’re proud to be a Brooklyn-based nonprofit registered with New York State and preparing to file for 501(c)(4) social welfare status.

He asked for my number, and I said no, but I ended up giving him my social media instead. He then asked me out for coffee and mentioned we could also get lunch at a place nearby. The café he suggested is literally one minute away from his apartment.

I was very clear from the beginning about my religion and that I don’t date casually. He’s in his 30s, I’m in my 20s. I don’t live in the area, and he doesn’t really know anything about me, so I’m not sure what assumptions he’s making.

I ended up not responding to him at first because I was dealing with a lot of stress in my life. He reached out again a few days later, and I ignored it again. Then he messaged once more, and this time I responded, and now we’re planning to go on a date soon. He’s mentioned that he’s a serious guy.

1pt8u6f,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedicalDevices/comments/1pt8u6f/bizarre_interview_process_has_me_questioning/,"Bizarre interview process has me questioning everything, advice wanted.","Hi everyone, I’m looking for perspective on a deeply confusing and unprofessional interview process with a large medical device company. I’m doing my best to stay factual.
(Context: I currently work in med device sales at a smaller company, so I have a baseline for what standard hiring processes usually look like.)

Timeline:

	1.	Applied for a Clinical Specialist role online in early November.

	2.	The following week, I was contacted directly by the Territory Manager (TM) via email. We had a long, in-depth phone screen (over an hour). After that call, all communication moved to text with the TM only.

	3.	The next week, I was invited to a shadow day. I spent the morning with a Principal Clinical Specialist and the afternoon with the TM observing a live procedure. Feedback was very positive, and we discussed reconnecting the following week to talk next steps.

	4.	The TM then had last-minute travel. When I followed up, communication became more casual (including him sending a “was just thinking of you” text and humorous travel anecdotes). No concrete next steps were provided. The following week, he suggested an in-person coffee chat.

	5.	At the coffee meeting, the TM arrived very late. When we met I expected a handshake but he initiated a prolonged, full-frontal hug. He then made comments about my appearance, and then pivoted to discussing how much of a “grind” the role is. He gave a significantly lower salary range than expected and introduced the idea of a 1099 contractor role with vague promises of “more money.”

	6.	After I sent a professional follow-up text reinforcing my interest in the role, he did not respond for several days, then reappeared to suggest another shadow day.

	7.	The next day, I received a formal email from HR stating that the position had been “canceled.”

	8.	I reached out to the TM. He apologized via text and attributed the cancellation to HR and end-of-year budgeting. Within two days, he scheduled a call. On that call, he asked about my weekend plans (it was a Friday), made a personal comment involving his wife, and said the role cancellation was due to an internal transfer and an HR “disconnect.” He described this as “not a goodbye, but a pause,” and said he would loop me in with his director and team early next year.

This entire process spanned roughly a month and a half.

Why I’m Confused:

The combination of a strong professional start, increasingly personal communication, inappropriate physical contact, a pivot toward a contractor role, a sudden HR cancellation, and then vague future promises has left me questioning what actually happened. At first, I chalked some of this up to a friendly personality, but in hindsight it feels like boundaries blurred very early and the goalposts kept moving away from a standard interview process.

My Question:

Has anyone in med device experienced something like this? Does this sound like a legitimate process that was catastrophically mismanaged, or are these red flags of something more manipulative? How should I interpret the idea of a “pause”? I do have interviews scheduled with a major competitor and would appreciate any perspective on how to proceed.",0,1766432382.0,MedicalDevices,6,0.5,False
1pt8syv,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1pt8syv/office_gave_me_a_career_and_a_relationship_remote/,"Office gave me a career and a relationship, remote work gave me an actual life","I met my girlfriend back  when we were both still going into the office every single day. Same building, different teams, started with random small talk near the coffee machine, you know how it goes. At that time  my whole routine was built around work. Commute, meetings, noise, eating lunch way too fast at my desk, coming home tired and feeling like the day just kinda ate me alive. I liked my  job, but everything else felt rushed and squeezed into tiny gaps. 

About a year later my role went fully remote. I honestly thought I’d miss the office more than I do. The structure, the  people, even the dumb small talk that feels pointless until it’s gone. What actually happend is that life slowed down, but in a good way. I work from home now, my girlfriend does her  own thing, sometimes cooking while I’m stuck in calls, sometimes we just sit in the same room doing completly different stuff. Lunch is real food now, not something inhaled in 10 minutes while answering emails. Breaks feel like actual breaks, not just staring at another  screen. 

The biggest change for me is  how the day ends. I log off and I’m already home. No commute, no mental transition, no feeling like I still owe the day something. I don’t hate the office, it gave me a career and honestly it  gave me this relationship too. But remote work gave me space. Space to focus, space to breathe, space to actually enjoy being with someone without feeling constantly drained. Turns  out productivity is way easier when your life doesn’t feel like it’s on pause until after work.",22,1766432302.0,remotework,1,0.96,False

My ex and I met senior year of college. For privacy sake let’s just say he played a sport in college, and I was one of the few people that didn’t know who he was. I was a bartender (so I didn’t go to any games) and  didn’t know much about sports. I had also recently gotten out of a long term relationship. Anyways, one day I was looking through my DMs, and he randomly found me on Instagram, and asked me on a date! We made a plan and went out. We connected instantly, and from the beginning it felt easy and real. He asked me to be his girlfriend 3 months later because he wanted to be sure and make sure we were both ready. He told me he loved me after 4 months, everything was great. We met each others families and they met eachother and got on so well. it was like a dream.

He found a very very high-pressure/high paying job that just so happened to be in my hometown against all odds, so when I graduated, everything lined up perfectly. We thought it was fate and were beyond happy and so were our parents. We did long distance for a bit while I finished up my last semester of school, then continued dating once I was finally back home from college. From early on, it felt like we were a team. 

Side note he is from another country and doesn’t have many people here at all. His whole family is in another country because he came here for his scholarship, and then work, so while he does have some friends, he keeps his circle very very small and is pretty isolated a lot especially after college was over. Over time, I became his closest person and he became mine. We didn’t live together (that goes against my beliefs), but we spent a lot of time together. He stayed at my parents’ house for weeks at a time before he got his place, and my family loved him. He even took my parents out to lunch sometimes without me just to show appreciation. He was affectionate, thoughtful, and very expressive. He planned dates constantly, wrote me cards, surprised me with gift cards or coffee, and called me just to hear my voice for a second. We went on trips together for his work, he always wanted me around. If I left to run errands too long while we were hanging out, he’d call asking when I was coming back because he missed me. he had one day off a week from work, and he would drive to my job just to grab coffee with me for 30 minutes during my lunch break. Even when I got hired at my new job he would express that when we were married he decided he would be more than ok if I didn’t want to work because he missed me so much while I was gone working. It went on like this for 2 years. 

So flash back to Last year, he spent a significant amount of money to fly me with him to his home country so I could see where he grew up and meet his family and spend time there. That trip meant a lot to him. We had the most amazing time it felt like a honeymoon. I had to fly back early work work, so about a month later he came back, though, something shifted. On the flight home, he had a bad panic attack. He had always expressed feelings of homesickness and definitely would tell me he had things wrong with him on the inside  that he didn’t understand, but no matter what he always said he was happy he had me. Once he was back, he became extremely homesick and kept saying how much he hated being here and missed his family. He told multiple people this, not just me. However we fell back into our routine, I helped move him into his new place, he would drive to my house after his long day of work just to see me for an hour! And things seemed to be looking up. He had brought up marriage before, but he did again this summer and said “so when are we getting married”, and even asked about my ring preferences. 

So things seemed more than okay. I actually felt more in love and more sure of him than ever. But slowly, I noticed he wasn’t himself. He talked a lot about possible burnout, feeling unfulfilled, feeling lost, and not being happy even though “everything should be good.” He was still loving toward me, still wanted me around, but something felt off and a little distant. 

Then his grandfather passed away. He couldn’t leave his job to go home for the funeral, and it completely broke him. I stayed with him a lot during that time. He held my hand all night when we slept. He even messaged my mom thanking her for letting me be there for him, saying I was helping him so much and that it made him love me even more. 

Around this time, I finally spoke up on his behavior. At this point we were not going on dates, he barely came to my house to see my family and spent all his time outside of work watching TV. He even spent 50 thousand dollars on a mental performance therapist because he was clearly desperate for help. I blamed this behavior on the death of his grandfather for a while, but after a while I had to speak up because there were some signs even before his grandfather died. To my shock he started expressing fear around marriage, kids, and religion. (I am a Christian he is not, and he was going to convert to be with me, this is something we had talked about forever and we were happy with that compromise) I was going to move back to his country eventually with him - that was my compromise. These weren’t new topics, but they became heavier. I didn’t pressure him, but eventually he started saying things like he didn’t know if he could give me what I wanted. That hurt me deeply, and I asked for some space because I was confused and scared. It was confusing because he always expressed how marriage and kids with me were something he wanted! When we were in his home country we even drove around at plots of land he wanted to one day build a house on for us. 

When I asked for space, he panicked. He begged me for hours not to leave. He said he could work on himself and his issues, he said give me 2 weeks I will be better. He said that he wanted to do it with me by his side rather than me leaving. He started journaling, reflecting, and making efforts. He even came to my church events with me, which mattered a lot to me. I later saw in his journal a line that said, “I want her to feel like the only girl in the world,” followed by a long entry I didn’t get to read fully.

I also read “do I want a wife? I’m just not sure right now. Do I want kids? That scares me.” 

I was so upset to see this. But at least I knew he was being honest with me and that there wasn’t another girl or some other explanation. 

Anyways, during this space, About a week later, he completely flipped. He said he needed to be selfless and be on his own. From there, everything became extremely chaotic. One day he would say we were broken up and he was sure of it and would be cold. An hour later, he would call me crying, saying he felt stupid, that he took me for granted, that I was his stability, and that he wanted to talk things through over dinner. The next day, he would say he couldn’t go to dinner anymore that there wasn’t nothing else to say, talking was a bad idea and he needed to detach emotionally and that I should move on. 

At one point, he called me after work saying he felt horrible and was asking if I was okay  and needed to talk. I waited at his apartment. The next day, he said he didn’t want to talk anymore. I still went over because I was confused. He was angry and cold at first, then broke down crying in my arms, told me I had the best heart, apologized, and hugged me tightly. Told me he told his work therapist that I checked all the boxes, and that if he were to get married it would be to me. Then he asked me to leave and said he needed to be alone. This was the last time I have seen him (it’s been about a month now). 

Two days before that, he had ended a call saying we were done. An hour later, he spam-called me, saying I was right about everything, that he didn’t want to run from his problems, and that he needed me. That I was his stability and he took me for granted.The back-and-forth was constant. 

Eventually, he became very cold. He told me he needed to detach emotionally, that he wanted to be alone, that he was happier that way, and that my feelings were no longer his responsibility. He said we were not compatible for the future and that I needed to move on. When I tried to understand or suggest he might be overwhelmed or depressed (things he himself had said before), he got angry and told me to stop telling him how to feel.

His parents reached out to me separately. His mom was crying and told me they are deeply worried about him and are making sure he gets real help when he goes home. She said she truly believed we were going to get married. His brother also reached out and expressed concern. They all say he hasn’t been himself for a while and they all felt so bad for me. 

Now he has blocked me, unblocked me, and then told me again not to contact him. He says he needs to be selfish, alone, and single,  and he’s happier this way. He said that he’s emotionally detached because it’s the only way for him to move on.

I’m left questioning everything. Was this depression or an adjustment crisis? Is this avoidant attachment? Did he truly stop loving me, or is he shutting down emotionally? Did he ever love me? Or was it all a lie, and he just didn’t want the future we talked about?

I’ve never experienced anything like this. He feels like a completely different person. I’m not trying to excuse hurtful behavior, but I genuinely don’t understand how someone can go from being so loving and sure to this cold and detached so quickly.

If anyone has experienced something similar, I’d really appreciate hearing your perspective.

Known familiarly as Banana Village, the main street is lined with butchers, fishmongers and fresh produce stalls with – as the name suggests – an abundance of banana clusters hanging from their eaves.

On the west side of the highway, surf camps and holiday villas take precedence – sitting just back from Banana Beach. If you’re not a fan of long treks to the beach, these are the most beachfront accommodation options you can find in the Tamraght area (bar the huge chain hotels).

Located just 3km south, accommodation in Aourir often falls under the bracket of Tamraght on booking websites. So it’s entirely possible to accidentally book a hostel in Banana Village and rock up wondering where all the supposed swanky coffee shops are.

I didn’t want to but she essentially got cold feet when things were getting serious (moving in together). She tried to villainize me and blame me for the break up but then later apologized and rescinded that reasoning (she’s a gaslighter, stay tuned for more). 

Post break up she was constantly back and forth about getting back together. Would ask to hang out, act like we were still together, then would go cold and distant. This happened over the span of 3-4 months before I had a enough. She did something really immature and toxic so I officially decided to end things for good by asking her to not reach out to me anymore.

She tried reaching out to me after this and would breadcrumb on social media but I ignored it so that I could heal and move on. She really damaged my already crippling trust issues. Her repeated gaslighting (and other actions) when we were together made me not trust myself and I couldn’t take anymore of it. I needed to heal.

Cut to 5 months later. I am finally feeling really good about being alone and trusting myself again. Then I get a text from a random number that says, “Hey bud 😘” and then a very very private almost fully naked picture of myself. A pic I took two years ago and only sent to my ex. I call the number but I am blocked and it goes straight to voicemail where I hear a full name. I contact my ex who I havent spoken to in 5 months and ask her how this happened and if she knew this name from this area code. She responds and says she has no idea because she never sent anyone that picture and thinks it may be a prank, but says she will look into it.

At this time I have two friends that go full detective and find out she has a new bf and this was his number. After I find this out my ex messages me and says she was up all night worried about this and trying to figure it out but couldnt. Says someone must just be pranking me. I find out she was actually up all night covering her tracks instead. She blocked me and these detective friends of mine and other people I am close to on social media and makes all of her Venmo transactions private (venmo is how my friend found out she was dating this guy). I of course tell her I know who it is and ask her to stop lying. 

She finally admits it was him and says it was an immature prank and that he will be reaching out to explain and apologize. A few hours later he texts me and says “that was just a prank. No need to contact \[ex\] xoxoxo”. I respond and tell him to go fuck himself xoxoxo, and send a screenshot of his text to my ex. I tell her someone better explain to me what is going on or I will get the police or a lawyer involved.

At this point I am very anxious and feel humiliated. I didn’t know if this was some kind of blackmail or revenge thing or if this picture would be spread online. I grew up with terrible body image issues after being bullied my whole life for being scrawny, to the point where I even developed an eating disorder. All things she knows all about.

She finally explains and says they got drunk that night and while she was in the bathroom he went through her phone, found the pic and my number, sent it to his phone, and then sent it to me. I find this hard to believe and dont trust her at this point, she has always been a chronic liar incapable of accountability. But I accept this is the answer I will get and express that I was upset that she lied at first. She is mortified by her new bf’s behavior and extensively apologizes for him and her lies. We end this on good terms where I ask her once again, to please stay out of my life.

A week goes by and she reaches out and tells me she broke up with her bf over this and was ashamed to even be associated with someone who would violate both of us like this. She goes into great detail about how mortified and in pain she was from the guilt of all of this. She then offers to buy me a drink to make up for it an apologize. I say i need some time to think about it.

About a week goes by and I accept her offer but agree to get a coffee instead. I want this person very much out of my life but figured it would be helpful to see her take accountability for her lies for once and to end this once and for all on good terms to get rid of any lingering resentment I feel. We agree on Thursday. Then on Wednesday she says that she apparently got vocal cord surgery recently and that she wasnt recoverying quickly and asked to push it to Sunday (later found out she got this surgery months ago). We agree on Sunday but then on Friday she reaches out again and says the doctors have put her on a 2 week vocal rest and wouldn’t be able to meet until after the holidays.

At this point I dont care about this anymore. She has a terrible history of bailing on me and never keeping a promise. I am annoyed but it isn’t worth me getting upset over. Right after this I had not one, but two mutual friends send me screenshots of her venmo which is public again. These two friends know about the whole situation and were vehemently against me meeting up with her and individually had her transactions come up on their Venmo feed. She’s had transactions almost every other day with her new “ex” showing that they were clearly still together, but the worst part was that they were mocking me with the captions in 2 of these transactions.

Both of them were quoting my messages to her when I was trying to figure out who sent me that picture, one of them being when I told her i was “thinking about getting the police or a lawyer involved” 

So she was simultaneously telling me she broke up with him and was so sorry and trying to meet while mocking me pubicly with him and still seeing him. At this point I am devastated and hurt all over again. I asked this person to stay out of my life twice now to avoid pain like this and both times she forced herself back in to cause more damage. She knows about my traumatic history of experiencing really bad betrayals and lies but still forced herself back in to make it all worse. All for what, some cruel dehumanizing joke? I sent her the venmo screenshots and told her how much this hurt me but no response. There was no way for her to lie her way out of this one.

But the worst part is that while we were dating she would minimize and gaslight me about any concerns I had and make me feel like I was overreacting so I am unsure if what I am feeling now is even valid. She would also prove this by literally never respecting a single perfectly reasonable boundary I ever put in place. So I am here asking you guys if it is ok that I feel completely devasted by this. I feel humiliated, embarrassed, tricked, violated, confused, and alone because of all of this. Also please let me know if anything else she has said or done seems like a lie to you.

1pt8hkr,https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1pt8hkr/a_deep_dive_on_grief/,A deep dive on grief,"I found [this intense article](https://health.yahoo.com/conditions/mental-health/grief/article/i-was-36-when-my-husband-died--heres-what-most-of-us-get-wrong-about-the-grieving-process-193742701.html) about grief and grieving. I think a lot of it applies for us here, from a couple of different angles (at least):

- *leaving* the organization that had to that point been such a major part of our consciousness, our purpose, our days, and even our *identity* does involve grieving (I'll get to that at the very bottom)
- those SGI members who suffered significant loss who received no support and were left feeling *worse* by the self-centered, thoughtless, callous responses by their SGI ""family""

The article is really long but well worth the time it takes to read it - I'll pull out just a few points:

>I was 36 when my husband died — here's what most of us get wrong about the grieving process

>Grief is universal, yet deeply personal. Instead of trying to ""fix"" or ""help"" someone who's grieving, it's important to make space for them to perpetually navigate the permanent reality of death.

You don't ""get better"". It never goes away. It's now part of your ""new normal"", however unwelcome - and it's inescapable.

>It was in that moment that I was hit with the earth-shattering loss I was about to experience. But it wasn’t just my own grief I was beginning to grapple with — it was other people’s experiences of my grief too, and their own challenges as they faced the loss of my husband. Their words, reactions, actions and inactions added an unexpected weight to my shoulders. It was jarring — an unwanted kind of knowing — to realize that our culture has no idea how to respond to immense trauma or grief, even though the grieving process is both inevitable and universal.

>May 31, 2018 — and the 69 days that followed — was when my heart began to break in ways I didn't know it could. It’s the day my world cracked open and began to shatter, even as I did everything in my power to keep the worst from coming true. It's when I started to grieve: for myself, for Lance, for the future we'd never have — the children we always said we would try for someday but never did. It was when I began to understand my own naïveté about pain, to say goodbye to the person I had been as part of a ""we,"" and to meet the version of ""me"" I didn't want to become. It's the day I saw him hold regret for the things he never did, and knew I'd be the one carrying those regrets for him for the rest of my life.

>And it’s the day I began to understand that grief is made even harder by a society that doesn’t know how to make space for the grieving.

>On August 7, 2018 — 69 days after his diagnosis — I grasped his hand and whispered in his ear, ""You can go. I don't want you to go, but you can. I love you. Somehow, I'll figure out how to be OK again. I promise,"" and he took his last breath.

>Just like that, I became a 36-year-old widow.

>**Explaining grief — trying to make it make sense to those who haven't experienced it — is its own kind of exhaustion.**

>It turns out, time doesn't heal all wounds. Life simply grows around the immediacy of the pain — the sun rises and sets, and new experiences accumulate, whether or not you want them to, gradually taking the edge off. However, grief isn't just ""deep sadness."" It's not depression. It's not something you ""get over"" or ""move on from.""

>Grief is the loss of someone you loved — a voice you'll never hear again, a laugh you'll never share. It's the inside jokes no one else understands, the clothing that won't be worn again, the doctor appointments you have to cancel. It’s the cellphone you don't know what to do with. The mail that arrives and will never be opened. It’s Facebook memories that don't have a ""now"" to add to the ""then."" It's a bed that won't be slept in, a dining room chair that remains empty, a silence that won't be filled.

>Spending time in nature and with animals helped me as I grieved, but my happiness was never whole — grief co-mingled with every breath.

>But from the outside, I was giving off ""success story"" vibes. When I recounted my experiences to new acquaintances, I was met with comments like, ""I love hearing stories like yours — you've overcome so much and have a beautiful life,"" or ""You're so strong. Your life is so interesting. You should be proud of yourself.""

>And while there were aspects of their interpretations I appreciated — I *was* proud of how hard I’d worked to figure out how to keep moving forward — **I also felt unheard. The part of my story where ""my husband died"" was brushed over in favor of ""I drive cattle on a ranch in Costa Rica."" I didn't want to be someone else's inspirational story. I didn't want my deep loss to make a stranger gasp at how ""interesting"" my life was.**

>Yes, I understood the viewpoint — a widow moving to Costa Rica, taking up surfing, opening a bar, marrying a Costa Rican cowboy, and starting a family would make a heartwarming plot for a Hallmark movie. But it felt like a snapshot of something that could only be truly understood in motion and three dimensions. **Those impressions — the pat, ""Look how well you're doing!"" — didn’t reflect the pain and chaos woven through every choice I made and every breath I took.**

She's describing the toxic positivity of ""Look on the *bright* side! Just think *happy* thoughts! Remember the *happy MEMORIES!*"" - from people made deeply uncomfortable by someone else's pain and looking for an excuse to ignore it.

>**“What you’re describing is an ‘either/or’ experience, where you’re either grieving or you’re ‘recovering.’ But the messages you’re getting — “You’re so brave! Look how well you’re doing!” — are nullifying the loss because everybody wants that story,” O’Malley told me. “It creates some space for them from the horrific place where you live every day.”**

>O’Malley, who teaches courses to medical students on the neurophysiology of loss, went on to explain that it’s not uncommon for the loved ones of a grieving individual to experience what feels like a threat to their own nervous systems. “In that mobilization, it inadvertently **creates unsafety for the grieving person,” he says. “The notion is that there’s some goal to reach, something to fix, something to heal, something broken that needs to be mended. But if the foundation of grief is love, then there’s nothing to fix.” And the pursuit of a “finish line” — when there’s no finish line to be had — negates the complicated, ongoing, daily reality of grief.**

>To O’Malley’s point, what I realized after Lance’s death was that **most people are terrified of grief. They don't know what to say or how to act. They want to ""be there,"" but not too close, because it's uncomfortable and painful. They want to focus on how to help you “overcome” and “get better” — to see you “on the other side” of the loss, where they can celebrate the triumphant comeback.**

>Our society loves a good comeback story.

Oh, wow - so does SGI. To the n^th degree! In fact, that's ALL SGI wants. I remember when I had left a career position (under *very* favorable terms, I might add) and was mentioning how confident I felt about what lay ahead. I'll never forget how my district MD leader, this offensive nebbish with underdeveloped social skills, peering at me through his Coke-bottle glasses, wagged his oversize [cartoon-vulture](https://i.postimg.cc/153FS3gz/image.png) head and warned me ""We don't tell the members about our problems until we've resolved them."" He didn't get it. I was utterly confident, and true to form, my next job was offered to me without my having yet sent out a single resume. But the whole idea that it's somehow ""inappropriate"" to talk about going through a difficult process? When that would be when you needed the support of your faith community the most?? 

Can you *imagine* an Ikeda cultist SGI zealot shrieking ""*CONGRATULATIONS!!!!!*"" at someone whose husband has just died?? The SGI cultists ghoulishly tend to do this when someone mentions a difficulty or a devastating medical diagnosis. It's ghastly. The SGI narrative is that you're supposed to *feel grateful* for all your difficulties - whatever they are - and say ""It's the best thing that could've ever happened to me"", embracing SGI's ""[ganken ogo](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/ww31n1/ganken_ogo_deliberately_creating_the_appropriate/)"" doctrine that explains that you CHOSE all of these events in some previous lifetime, and then *CREATED* these *experiences* yourself, through your OWN life, *so you could prove the power of this practice"". This grotesque pronouncement has the additional purpose of advance notification that you are NOT willing to hear any ""negativity"" or ""complaining"" or ""whining"" - SGI dictates that the sufferer must only say, ""I'm determined to 'turn poison into medicine' and use this adversity to 'do my human revolution' and create a powerful VICTORY in my life to *reply to $en$ei!!*"" And then they're on their own.

[SGI-USA: ‘Rejoice When You Encounter Hardships’](https://web.archive.org/web/20250627103937/https://www.worldtribune.org/2025/rejoice-when-you-encounter-hardships/) - *SEE?*

Can you *imagine* the casual, clueless cruelty of pressuring someone who has lost a spouse or a *child* to publicly refer to this as ""the best thing that could've ever happened to me"" - or be shunned in their grief as so many SGI members have been??

Here you can see the brutal undercurrent in this Icky Ikeda pronouncement:
 
>>The more challenges we face, the more joyfully we should move forward and the more determinedly we should tackle them—this is the essence of Nichiren Buddhism and the most valuable way to lead our lives.

>>A joyless life is miserable. Those who are put off by everything, who are always negative, wear pained expressions, and do nothing but criticize and complain, are not living as the Daishonin teaches in his writings.

>>Those who can find joy in everything, who can transform everything into joy, are genuine experts in the art of living.

>>Finding joy in everything—when you brim with joy, you will lift the spirits of those around you, bring smiles to people’s faces, and create value. [Source](https://archive.ph/ROBQS)

The person suffering severe grief will get NO support, NO compassion, NO empathy. Instead, they'll probably be *scolded* - as you can see, Ikeda has made it clear they're supposed to provide *entertainment* and *inspiration* to others, even while getting NOTHING for themselves. It's a *brutal* expectation of those who are already suffering so intensely. I'll put examples at the end so you can see that this is indeed the reality of the Dead-Ikeda-Corpse-Mentor-cult SGI.

Back to the article:

>Inadvertently, **these reactions make your grief about *them* — *their* feelings, *their* expectations for how you should cope.** This isn't coming from a bad place. Friends and family genuinely want you to be OK again. But **they don't want to (or simply can’t) see the pain and trauma in its fullness, as if it might be ""catching.""** I remember telling friends shortly after Lance died, ""I feel like I'm a car wreck. Everyone slows down to see the aftermath, but almost no one stops to help.""

>As the days, weeks and months wear on, any initial understanding begins to fade because for most people, the loss has softened. **The call to “move on” seems rational to someone who isn’t waking up every day in an empty bed or grappling with the reality of letting go of shared dreams and a life plan that ended far too soon.**

>The dissonance that develops between your grief and others’ expectations of your grief becomes a confusing imbalance. For you, certainly, but also for those around you. Death changes everything. You swing through a pendulum of emotions, making choices and developing coping mechanisms that can worry or scare the people in your support system. And **when you're struggling just to get through each day, the weight of your loved ones' concern — and their efforts to help you “get over” your grief — can add to the depths of sorrow and pressure you're already carrying.** Unfortunately, there is no clear roadmap for how to grieve.

>**Instead of offering stillness and support through the ongoing, seemingly endless daily turmoil of loss, the focus shifts to “recovery,” “moving on,” and any silver lining that might come after the storm. The narrative becomes about a ""brave fight"" and ""overcoming loss,"" but framing death through the lens of recovery fails to give space for the pain as it actually unfolds, leaving the grieving even more isolated in their experience.**

>#What grief needs is silent support and tangible assistance — not worry, judgment or unsolicited advice

>It was many of the people who loved me most that I eventually realized I needed the most distance from as I began to navigate widowhood. These were the people who knew the ""before me,"" who held expectations of who I was and who I should be as I attempted to continue my life. The ones who gave me advice about how to ""move on."" Who told me, ""You should be better by now,"" or ""It's been six months, Laura — why are you still like this?"" Or, when I shared that I was seeing someone, replied, ""Oh, I'm so glad, I was afraid you would never move on,” as if my 18-year relationship could so easily be replaced or forgotten.

>But I didn't want or need advice or judgments about my recovery timeline — I had a therapist to help me through those battles. What I needed was space to learn how to live a life that kept going while half of me was gone. I needed room to fumble and stumble and figure out how to get back up again on my own. I didn't want or need someone else's worry interfering with my process or pace.

>**“One of the most important things to know about grief is to understand that it doesn’t work in stages,” says Candi K. Cann, PhD, a professor and ""death scholar"" at Baylor University who specializes in the culture of death and the grieving process, and author of *Virtual Afterlives: Grieving the Dead in the Twenty-First Century*. She explains that Elisabeth Kübler-Ross’ famous stages of grief theory was developed for the dying patient confronting their own impending death, not for those grieving the loss of a loved one.**

>She also affirmed my own experience. “Grief is not linear or progressive. It is, in fact, messy, unpredictable and oscillates from one extreme of feeling OK to the other of feeling terrible, and gradually one just learns to navigate the sudden swings and figure out how to try to walk in the middle.” This “walking in the middle” is known as [Stroebe and Schut’s dual process model](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10848151/) — a model that Cann says more accurately describes how grief “actually acts and feels.”

>When I told people I was a widow [in Costa Rica], I was often met with a soft touch, a place to sit and a silent understanding that life is hard, often unfair and full of pain. They brought me plates of food and made me coffee. **They let me share my story or let me sit in silence. They let me lead the way. The support was quiet and tangible — and exactly what I needed.**

>Of course, it’s hard to know what to say or do when a new acquaintance shares something as traumatic as a loved one’s death and their bereavement. One of the first, best steps you can take is to “not make an assumption about the relationship [you’re] hearing about,” O’Malley says. He adds that instead of jumping straight into condolences, you might try a phrase like “If we get a chance, I’d like to hear your story sometime.” This shifts the exchange from what O’Malley calls “prescriptive grief” (i.e., “how can I help you?”) to “narrative grief” (i.e., “tell me your story”) and allows space for the grieving person to share as much or as little as they choose.

>What I've learned in the seven years since Lance died is that grieving is universal, but also deeply misunderstood. It's avoided until it can't be. Most well-meaning people don't know how to be there for someone who is actively grieving. Grief, until it's experienced, can't be truly grasped — and those who struggle to find the right words and come up short should be given grace for their efforts.

>However, **our cultural understanding of grief needs to shift. It shouldn’t focus on recovery, steps or stages.** It should acknowledge that grief, at its core, is love. This is why it lasts forever. Grief melds and integrates with life’s ongoing tapestry, but it’s the cord that never ends. **Love remains despite death, and grief is simply an expression of love that has nowhere tangible to go.**

>#There is no end. There is no timeline. There is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" way to grieve — only the way you learn to live with love that has lost its place to land.

One of the HUGE weaknesses of an all-laity group like the Dead-Ikeda-Corpse-Mentor-cult SGI is that there is NO ONE who is trained in anything meaningful. Here's what I'm talking about - these are the things that actual *clerics* are trained in and officially empowered to do:

- Grief counseling
- Marital counseling
- Family counseling
- The legal requirements for when to call the police or child protective services (mandatory reporter training)
- Marriage ceremonies

**[No one in SGI can perform a legally-binding wedding ceremony](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/1nei1xl/its_official_sgiusa_isnt_a_real_religion/)** - SGI does not train or designate official status for that. It makes sense from the SGI standpoint - with so many quitting left and right, it would likely be wasted effort to establish such positions. So SGI members have to go get legally wed by a justice of the peace [or some OTHER religion's priests](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/z4lecp/tday2_three_instaweddings_none_officiated_by_sgi/) (oh, the irony) and THEN they can have their nonbinding, performative *social* celebration of their union, however they want that to look, with SGI. I explained it away when I was in SGI, but now that I have the benefit of freedom from the SGI's deleterious indoctrination and [communal abuse](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/x0tq5k/communal_abuse_and_cults/), I can see it for what it is. Something SGI members DON'T get *that they WOULD get if Ikeda hadn't gotten himself - and everyone else - excommunicated*. There *were* priests who were willing to be affiliated with Ikeda's new Nichiren-Shoshu-free lay organization - and many thought that would be the next development - but Ikeda wasn't about to share power OR PAY with priests who would *definitely* be regarded as theological *superiors* to an untrained, uncertified, uneducated buffoon like himself.

And so SGI members get to do without. Yay.

So when SGI members brag and bray about ""No priests!!"" like it's some kind of brilliant innovation, know that you will not get the kind of in-depth help you need when you need it most. You will not be getting what *others* expect - and get - from THEIR faith communities. [Here's what has been reported from within SGI](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/ssdp4m/sgis_fundamental_lack_of_compassion_and_inability/):

>**'I have been shocked over the past few years how insensitive leaders have been concerning life and death issues.'**

>You and me both - and the general membership as well! I would go further in that **I see amongst those of long-time association with SGI a smugness, a sense almost of pride that they do not suffer from the same sadness and sense of loss that affects most of the rest of the population in the face of death, dreadful illness and other sufferings. On the contrary, to be emotionally impervious to human suffering - both their own and also that of others - seems to be the goal of die-hard Gakkers who flaunt their artificial happiness in the faces of those who have not lost their sense of humanity.** Ironically, Nichiren Daishonin said of himself that, when it came to compassion, he could put others such as T'ien-t'ai and Miao-lo, to shame. However, **the version of his teachings developed by the SGI breeds people who become devoid of compassion, seemingly regarding it as the preserve of inferior people, and therefore to be looked on with contempt.** [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/9qrl22/nam_myoho_renge_kyo/e8cikdm/)

>>The smug judgement comment comes in small part from a very painful experience when I developed 4th stage Hodgkin’s disease – **a leader told me that I got cancer because I had resigned my position as district chief a year earlier.** [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/lz43oo/threatsabusecontrol_of_members/)

>For the last 20 years I have Had to pull myself up alone. After 2 great losses in my family, I began to see **SGI does not act like a family**. Not talking about the members. I was shocked that **No one was equipped to understand grief and I felt hurt at every turn**. I have been trying to understand what is happening. ( one comment I have about SGI and the daimoku is many alit of leaders do not have a strong practice. Sorry for the rambling. It is hard to put into words. [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGIcultRecoveryRoom/comments/ai2mvy/44_years_of_practice_i_am_looking_for_advice_i/eeqfeit/)

>>it was my own personal experience with cancer that finally opened my eyes. **My partner was a practicing member for 20 years when he was diagnosed in 2007, and lost his battle with esophageal cancer in 2014. During the entire time, not one single solitary district, chapter or area leader/member came to visit. Not at home, and not during his many stays in the hospital. We were on our own, even though they all knew. I've never seen anyone so hurt in my life, he never cried from the pain or effects of his chemo or radiation, but he cried and cried as he came to the realization that these folks, people he considered friends, just didn't give a shit. After so many years, so much effort, never missing a meeting or KRG while he was still healthy enough to travel, and not even a phone call when he really needed it the most. Of course I was affected, I just couldn't believe it. They would ask about him at meetings, but beyond that NOTHING. I will never forgive that pack of frauds. Yeah, Linda Johnson and the whole pack of 'em can kiss my ass.** [Source](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/ssdp4m/sgis_fundamental_lack_of_compassion_and_inability/mbbfap6/)

>Although Nichiren Daishonin's ""Buddhism"" (don’t make me laugh – it’s about as Buddhist as the Pope) promulgates **both the ""You are the result of your horrible karma, bad person!"" theory and the ""You chose your karma to show the world how magical the magic mantra is when you chant it to the magic scroll""**, I remember very clearly that when I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis - a condition that put me in a wheelchair after a few years – it was the first of these that **one of the Japanese members used to hit me over the head with, making me feel even worse, as in: ""I do not know what you did, you must have done something.""** Yes, because I am so sinful and evil I DESERVED to get a very painful, incurable and degenerative disease. When you deconstruct Nichirenism down to its basic elements, it is **nothing but sadism**.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/40shk1/why_sgi_is_not_buddhism_part_2/cyxufj9/) you can read about how SGI leaders *refused* to allow a bereaved new widow with two small children to schedule an official daimoku toso in her own home, just 5 1/2 months after her husband had been killed in a car accident, because ""she hadn’t taken the time to attend any of the regular meetings"".

>#If you were practicing properly, it wouldn't matter what was going on your life - you'd still be as happy as a clam. If you aren't happy, you're wrong . . . It's your fault, and you damn well better understand that if you were following the program, you'd have a permanent, ear-to-ear grin. To not be happy is to betray the practice, Nichiren, and Ikeda. You are not entitled to feelings of your own; you can only have the feelings that SGI says you can have.

And this (about someone *else*):

>There was something about [first SGI-USA General Director] Mr. Williams that gave the impression that he was making a genuine effort, and it endeared him to many people.

>I had a couple of one-on one encounters with Mr. Williams. They happened when I was recently widowed and was deeply bereaved. The impression I got was that he sincerely tried to console and encourage me. He shared a little about his own experience with grief when his father died, and he truly wished me better times to come. I remember feeling better after the first encounter, which was just a few, impromptu words he shared with me.

>The second time I met him, he was at the start of his penance tour (though I, as a general member, didn't know that's what it was at the time.) He was going around the country meeting with members and especially trying to pull people back from the temple. Most of the members he met with were people who had family members or close friends who had gone with the temple. I was an exception.

>**MY district had, without my knowledge, arranged for a face-to-face with Mr. Williams and me following our district meeting, because I hadn't sufficiently ""recovered"" yet from my grief. Yep, you heard that right. A recently widowed woman with two small children was considered not sufficiently happy for the group's comfort. I was a ""problem"" and needed ""guidance."" Well, I guess I was bumming them out when I didn't have the energy to keep up the happy-clappy act they wanted from me. Gee, I wonder why?**

>To his credit, Mr. Williams was warm and compassionate -- truly kind. When I left, however, I was deeply discouraged. At the time, I thought that if even Mr. Williams couldn't encourage me, then I must really be a lost cause. Fortunately, good non-SGI friends, family and a good therapist convinced me otherwise and supported me through the hardest days.

>I didn't and still don't hold it against my fellow members that **they judged and shamed me in my grief.** They were simply clueless. They knew I was chanting; they saw me at meetings, so why wasn't I ""over it'? **Why it didn't occur to someone to talk with me, or offer to babysit, or cook a meal, or do ANYTHING that a normal community would do when someone is bereaved, I don't know. They were good people. The best I can figure is that their belief that the practice ""worked"" for everything disconnected them from their empathic sense. They felt so helpless. So they offered me (Well, ambushed me with) what they thought was the BEST they could give -- guidance from a National Leader. Surely THAT would fix me, now!**

We’ve been friends for 11 years, and the last 3 years in university were amazing—we got really close and were inseparable, which makes the last few weeks of his behavior so much worse. (names are fake for privacy) i also happen to be partners with dave  in a local brand we opened (which i invested all my money into) and he has the same behaviour in work too  
**The Dave System**

I admit I get lazy about uni; I think the classes are useless, so I do the minimum. Dave, on the other hand, is a brown-noser. He treats TAs and professors like **gods**—buying them coffee and getting **insider info no one else had**. This meant Dave was always the **team leader**, and his connections **guaranteed us full marks**. The routine was: he gets the info, he and Jana do the main work, and he gives the rest of us tiny bits.

He was a nightmare to work with for others. He’d constantly **abuse any random teammates** who showed initiative and genuinely tried working with him, calling them **slurs** and **sabotaging them** by sending the work at **4 AM on discussion day**, then **lying to the TA** that they ""don't care and that they didn't do any of the work."" I **regret always agreeing with him** just to shut him up. This pattern happened on something like **31 out of 36 projects**. Dave is seriously manipulative and has a huge **narcissistic streak**.

**The Cliffhanger Betrayal**

A month ago, **the toxicity hit me personally**. Uni said we could discuss projects early for bonus points, but there was **no official date**. Dave gave **vague warnings** about discussing Subject 1 and 2 on three straight days (Sun, Mon, Tue) without actually doing anything, just randomly texting ""**we might discuss tomorrow**."" Since we literally hadn't done any work and it wasn't an official date, I figured it was nonsense and went to bed at 10 PM Tuesday.

At 11 PM, Dave finished the project and **sent it to my DMs**. I woke up at 9 AM Wednesday to a **frantic call** from our other friend, Sara: ""**Where are you? We are about to discuss the project!**"" I rushed to campus, realizing they were indeed discussing **TWO projects**.

When I confronted them: Dave played dumb: ""**I told you yesterday!**"" I reminded him he said ""**might**,"" and that he just sent a **full project at NIGHT**. Then the **gaslighting started**. He accused me of not checking the file, and Jana chimed in with, ""**Yeah, we stayed up until 5 AM fixing that project and all you did was sleep**."" And Sara seemed like she already knew everything. Keep in mind we HAVE A GROUP CHAT for each project, they **did not send a SINGLE text** over the group chat. I was **so shocked and humiliated** that I just stood there.

**Escalation and Public Slander**

After I got through that discussion, I decided to **overcompensate** to prove I wasn't a burden. But the abuse continued. Dave pulled the same trick on a random girl for Subject 2, insulting her and using slurs. When I tried to intervene, **Jana and Sara backed Dave up**, saying he was ""**in the right**.""

He then started making **passive-aggressive ""jokes""** about me sleeping all day. Worse, he told the TA that the girl was a **""bitch"" who did nothing**, and the TA just laughed because he thinks Dave is a hard worker.

**The Final Humiliation**

For Subject 3, I worked **tirelessly**—over **10 hours a day for three days**, even **missing my brother's birthday**. I sent the perfect project to Dave, telling him specifically to test it because it failed on Sara's PC. He replied, ""**It works perfectly bro its amazing**.""

The next morning, I saw he sent a ""**FINAL version**"" at **5 AM**. At uni, Jana immediately screamed at me, saying they stayed up until 5 AM fixing my ""**half-assed**"" project that was ""missing requirements."" I knew I worked my butt off, but they kept humiliating me.

In the discussion, **my project failed to run** (I assume Dave messed it up at 5 AM). He covered it by showing a video to the TA. Then, when I thanked the professor, Dave looked right at me and said, ""**You worked really hard snoring in bed ya?**""—a sarcastic jab, **in front of the professor**. It was a deliberate, **public attack to steal credit**.

I went home immediately, **recorded a video proving the project worked flawlessly**, and sent it to the group. His response? ""**ok go watch it alone then**."" When I told him his comment hurt, he called me a ""**cry baby, it's just a joke**"" and then said my previous warning about the project not running ""**wasn't clear**""—the exact confusion he constantly exploits in others.

**The Isolation**

That was yesterday. **Dave went silent**. Today, the abuse continued. After we got a bad grade on a different project (the TA didn't know Dave, thankfully), I said I studied hard. Jana immediately jumped in: ""**You always study but you never work! you study and sleep and you get grades**.""

For tomorrow's final project, I offered to carry the work and went home to start. I sent them the file. They said they'd work. **Six hours later, zero response from Dave or Sara.** I called. No answer.

I realized with certainty that **they are now doing to me ""his best friend for ELEVEN years""** the **same exact thing they do to the ""randoms,"" isolating me, cutting me out, and setting me up to fail** right before the discussion. Dave is a **narcissistic control freak**, and his friendship means **absolutely nothing** if I don't give him all the credit and silent approval.

You spend months coding in your cave. You drink too much coffee. You neglect your friends. Finally, you launch on Product Hunt. You spam your Twitter, beg for upvotes, and get a nice little spike of traffic.

And then? **Silence.**

A week later, your product is buried under 50 new AI wrappers, and you’re back to square one.

The problem isn't your product. The problem is that current platforms are designed for *marketers*, not builders. They are full of other developers trying to sell to developers. It’s an echo chamber where everyone is shouting, ""Look at me!"" and nobody is actually listening (or buying).

We realized that building an audience is actually harder than building the product itself. And that’s backward.

**So, we decided to fix it.**

We are building **LaunchBackers**. It’s not just another directory where you post once and die. We completely rethought the mechanism of how products grow.

Instead of a one-time splash, we built a space for **continuous storytelling**.

* **Built-in Blogging:** Every product gets a dedicated blog space.
* **True Subscriptions:** Users don't just ""upvote""; they subscribe to your *journey*. When you push an update or a V2, they actually know about it.
* **Crowdfunding & Backing:** This is the game-changer. We integrated funding directly into the lifecycle. You can raise support for a specific feature, a V2, or just initial traction.

But the biggest issue we wanted to solve? **The Echo Chamber.** We are building a mechanism specifically designed to attract *actual users -* ordinary people, not just other SaaS founders. We’re introducing a system (which I can’t fully spoil yet, but it involves unique incentives for non-creators) that turns passive scrollers into active **Backers**.

We want to make ""building in public"" actually profitable, not just a vanity metric.

If you’re tired of the ""Launch and Ghost"" cycle, I’d love for you to check out what we’re cooking. We’re dropping the full details on the ""Backer"" innovation to our newsletter subscribers first.

I've been doing it for as long as I can remember and have learned how to scout promising spots the hard way. Hopefully this post helps you identify productive water more quickly! In Florida, there are almost as many ponds as people in some areas and almost all of them have fish.

 A backyard 5lber!
Using Google Maps to Find Fishable Ponds
The easiest and the most effective ways to find fishable ponds is to hop on Google Maps and toggle between satellite and normal view. The best ponds are slightly off the beaten path. Since they're smaller than lakes, any fishing pressure is magnified. So if you can see it from the road, there are probably hundreds of other people who have stopped to fish it, too. This means the fish are smart, and it will likely be tough to get a solid bite.

Using Google Street View also helps you check for gates and No Fishing signs. This has saved me many wasted drives by spotting these blockers prior to arriving. On the flip side, I've also seen some where people were actively fishing! I generally take that as a green light to hit that spot assuming there aren't any No Fishing signs.

This goes without saying, but I'm going to say it anyways: make sure you're not trespassing to access these ponds. Catching some ditch pickles (largemouth bass) is not worth an arrest! Also, always be mindful when you're fishing in people's backyards. Don't leave trash, blast music, or otherwise be disruptive as you'll ruin it for everyone else. With that out of the way, let's get into it!

Why Pond Hopping?
The first reason is pretty obvious: it is very accessible. Pond hopping allows you to fish for bass anywhere there is water without having to have a boat or kayak. Most neighborhoods have a pond or two that the residents (and sometimes anyone) can fish. This brings fishing to almost everyone without the need for travel or expensive gear.

Secondly, there are a surprising number of bigger bass in these residential ponds. With a smaller footprint, there are fewer places for them to hide. This means bank hopping can produce a bunch of big bass when you're dialed in!

Finally, you can switch spots relatively quickly as ponds are typically independent of each other. If one is slow or the vegetation is overgrown/died off there are other ponds you can hit nearby. While ponds will respond similarly to weather events, some may get a hot (or cool) water discharge from storm drains or springs to help mitigate the impact and improve the bite.

Size & Depth of Ponds
There is a goldilocks size for ponds. If a pond is too big, it gives the bass too many places to hide outside of casting range. Too small? There isn't enough forage to sustain many fish and sometimes the ponds will even dry up! The right size for me is a pond that is about 2-3 cast lengths wide at the widest and can be variably long. This way, I can cover most of the water, but it is large enough to have a solid forage base and will not dry up during the dry season.

Pond depth, especially in Florida, can be tricky. Much like the pond size, if it is too deep, there isn't enough sunlight reaching the bottom, which allows for grass to grow and provide somewhere for bait to hide. If the pond is too shallow, weeds may choke out the entire pond making it unfishable as well as leading to significant temperature fluctuations. I like a pond with a decent slope (1:2 or 1:4) and a maximum depth of around 15 feet if it's a manmade pond. This provides plenty of area for grass to grow, but should allow for fishable open water year-round. Natural ponds have a ton more variables, and quite frankly, are very rare in my neck of the woods so I won't get into them.

One quick note about water clarity. Most of the ponds are a tea or coffee color due to tannins in the water. This is totally normal! However, if you see a ton of suspended particles/turbidity there may be low oxygen due to material decomposition and/or lack of photosynthesis. I won't write a pond off immediately as ponds will go through periods of clear water and clouded water, but I wouldn't put it at the top of my list for ones to try.

Vegetation
Reeds and a swamp kitty!
Just like the previous section, there should be a happy medium as far as amount of vegetation. With too much vegetation, you can't cast. If there isn't any vegetation, there is nowhere for forage species to hide! I'll break this into two sections, surface and subsurface vegetation for ease of discussion.

Surface Vegetation
Surface vegetation is anything that is normally on the surface, such as reeds and lily pads. I typically do not like ponds with lily pads or dense reed mats as it is hard to fish the centers of them, which eliminates a lot of water and gives bass plenty of spaces to hide. Small patches of lilies, dollar weed, or reeds can be great if they're the exception rather than the dominant type of vegetation. Many areas are also unfishable from reeds growing from the bank to 10' or more into the pond, so keep an eye out on Google Maps and avoid ponds that have a wall of reeds around it.

Subsurface Vegetation
Subsurface vegetation is anything that is primarily submerged, such as hydrilla and Kissimmee grass. Ponds with some hydrilla or other grasses are typically great with the caveat that there is still fishable water. I love seeing grass with potholes and interspersed open areas as bass like to hide on the edges and ambush bait that wander into the open.

If you're fishing open water over a weed mat, bass love to tuck in and blow up bait above them. Sometimes in the summer these grasses make it all the way to the surface and make it unfishable, but if you have 2-3 feet of water cover over the grass, you should be in good shape! If there is patchy grass, you can also work your weedless baits through them to great success.

While Google Maps is a great tool, it rarely gives you the full picture. So get the most up-to-date scoop on the vegetation by visiting the pond. Many HOAs will spray herbicides on occasion, which can cause a massive shift in productivity once the grasses die off. So just because the spot is good today, it may not be good after the next spray.

 
Key Fishing Features to Look for When Pond Hopping
Pond hopping is a numbers game. Out of every 10 ponds I fish, I won't return to 5 of them, 2-3 of them are OK and will warrant at least one return trip, and 1-2 of them are good. Because you have to work a lot of water, you need to be efficient to find the 1 or 2 out of 10 ponds that are worth your while.

Looking at the pictures of the two ponds above, I'll break down what looks ""good"" and areas I typically focus on when pond hopping. Notice the size is about 2-3 casts wide at the widest, and neither pond looks at risk of drying up during a drought.

1. Culverts
Call them culverts, pipes, storm drains, or something else, I always stop and fish every culvert I come across. They provide cover, a change in structure from the grass, and sometimes a highway to other ponds. I'll start by working the edges and then finally just plunking my lure straight down the opening. I'll give it a few jigs while standing on the culvert and hook up!

If you notice current flowing from them, then you hit the jackpot! Fish stack up next to any outflows feeding on bait that coming down the pipe.

2. Rip Rap
Rip rap is an erosion mitigation feature that uses chunks of rock to stabilize a bank. The rock provides shelter, and as an added bonus, it will absorb and radiate heat out during the wintertime. This keeps the water by it a few degrees warmer, which attracts a lot of fish. Much like a culvert, it is a different type of cover and will hold fish when other cover, such as hydrilla, doesn't.

Sometimes the rip rap doesn't extend into the water, but you never know unless you check it out!

3. Visible Vegetation
On the top pond, you can see my favorite type of vegetation. These black areas interspersed with sand along the bank is some type of grass. You can't tell for certain from Google, but you can also notice that the pond isn't overgrown so you should be able to fish it. Again, if the HOA sprayed recently, it may be radically different. But this is why you scout things out!

4. Pockets
Pockets of water that branch off from the main pond provide nesting grounds as well as plenty of shoreline for bass to patrol. They're typically more shallow than the main part of the pond but will allow you to fish both banks on one cast. Sometimes they're way too shallow, but sometimes they're perfect for bass in transition in the spring and fall.

5. Canals, Channels & Cut Throughs
Much like how culverts can create fish highways, narrow channels between two or more ponds are almost always a great spot to key in on. Fish will be on either side if there is no current waiting to ambush prey as they traverse the narrow passage. If there is a current, fish on the downstream side because bass will be waiting for the current to bring bait to them like a food conveyor!

Honorable Mention – Fish Beds
If you can see a ton of fish nests via Google Maps, that is a pretty sure indicator of fish. In Florida, many of the beds you see from the satellite view are of tilapia. But juvenile tilapia are excellent forage for larger bass and show that the pond is capable of sustaining life.

TL;DR
The ponds you should focus in on are not readily seen from a major road. They should not be too big or too small, too deep or too shallow, and have some vegetation. The 5 areas I key in on to fish when trying a new pond are: culverts, rip rap, vegetation, pockets, and channels. In my next segment, I'll get into what lures I throw and how to fish them.

Until next time, tight lines and cheers!

I’m Lucas, a car enthusiast who got tired of answering the same question over and over again:

“What’s done to it?”

Every time I posted my car on Instagram or met someone at Cars & Coffee, the comments and conversations were the same; people wanted to know the mods, the parts, the story.

The problem: the answers were always scattered across notes apps, old DMs, Google Docs, or random links.

So I built [**showmy.build**](http://showmy.build/).

It’s a **free** share-first public page for car enthusiasts to put *everything* about their build in one place:

* photos, videos and description
* a clean, readable mod list
* social media/external links
* and a timeline of how the car came together

You can kind of think of it like Linktree for cars.

So we fixed sharing online, cool. What about in person?

We fixed that, too. Add your build to your **Apple Wallet** to easily share in person at the (double) tap of a (power) button.

The coolest part: your mod list can earn for you. Once you enable monetization, mods automatically become affiliate links. If someone checks out your build and buys a part, you get paid. Anyone can enable this, even free users. Hop on one of our subscription plans to *double* or *triple* your earnings instantly.

My goal with [showmy.build](http://showmy.build/) is to give car enthusiasts a place where their build actually *belongs*— and a way to fund the next mod while they’re at it.



I’d love to hear what you guys think! This platform is made *for you*, so any feedback will be taken very seriously.

Thanks lads!

Met at a party and talked for 2 hours, I could immediately tell that he was ""my breed"" because the way I vibe with people with adhd or other things is completely different to the way I vibe with ""normal"" people. People with autism or ADHD usually share my energy level, conversation topic speed and can generally keep up with me so I do not feel like I have to focus on not getting sidetracked or staying on topic, generally I mask less and don't censor myself.

So I liked him from that and we exchanged contacts. We met on an official first date on saturday where again the conversation flowwed like never before, I am not exaggerating the fact that I've never had such an engaging yet fastpaced and unfocused but still entertaining conversation where we both were in our element. I have never laughed this hard on a date. After 3 hours we went to grab a bite and sat at a bench where we yapped even more for 2 hours before we headed back to his and explored more of the physical part of the connection.

I know I tend to obsess and fantasize and that it could be part of the adhd as I make people better in my dreams and generally become delusional. But I was straight forward with him about the fact that I liked him and that I never vibe this way with anyone. He shared the same sentiment and even said it's like Carly Rae Jepsen and I immediately started singing ""I really really really really like you.. etc"" since he was hinting at that.

As we're lying in bed cuddling he traces my face and says he ""wants to remember every line"" as we wont be seeing each other again for several weeks due to the holidays and january exams.

But this had me spiraling, it is mutual, its not limerence as its not onesided, but what if it is? Also are we mutually love-bombing each other because we both have this new exciting connection that went amazing. Spent 20 amazing hours together and both kept expressing how much we're enjoying each other, even planning already on more dates when he's back and even a quick coffee. What if this is just a symptom? I cannot tell if this is the start of a good healthy thing or if its an obsession like a new hobby that will die in a few months.

1pt8ag2,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pt8ag2,I built a small daily word game and would love some honest feedback,"Hi everyone,

I am the creator of a small daily word game called WordHit.  
Each day you try to find three hidden words in a 7×7 grid. A round takes a few minutes.

The words fit a given theme and can appear horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.  
You have limited clicks, so you need to think before guessing.

I am mainly looking for feedback on  
• whether the rules feel clear  
• if the monthly competition adds value  
• whether finishing a round feels satisfying

I am not trying to promote anything. Just genuinely curious what other word game fans think.

we kept talking after that, but i had some prior arrangements with friends and he had to go see his family so we didn’t hang out, and then suddenly he texts me “i don’t think you like me in that way” and i called him out on the coffee situation and then called him out cuz he had previously said i don’t put any effort into the situationship even tho i was the one always driving to him and i always paid my own things. and he apologized and from there we never talked again, i didn’t reply and he didn’t say anything else.

now im left wondering if i overreacted over some coffee and was wondering if i should reach out for the holidays? maybe its cuz i feel lonely and have dealt with even worse people that i feel like he was ok compared to everyone else. do i reach out or do i let it die? :/

1pt8a77,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToxicFriends/comments/1pt8a77/narcissist_best_friend_humiliates_me_and_never/,"narcissist ""best friend"" humiliates me and  never apologizes and is trying his best to hide the fact that he's trying to make me fail","Hey Reddit, I need to vent about my friend, ""Dave"" (his GF is Jana, I’m Jacob). We’ve been friends for 11 years, and the last 3 years in university were amazing—we got really close and were inseparable, which makes the last few weeks of his behavior so much worse. (names are fake for privacy)

The Dave System

I admit I get lazy about uni; I think the classes are useless, so I do the minimum. Dave, on the other hand, is a brown-noser. He treats TAs and professors like gods—buying them coffee and getting insider info no one else had. This meant Dave was always the team leader, and his connections guaranteed us full marks. The routine was: he gets the info, he and Jana do the main work, and he gives the rest of us tiny bits.

He was a nightmare to work with for others. He’d constantly abuse any random teammates who showed initiative and genuinely tried working with him, calling them slurs and sabotaging them by sending the work at 4 AM on discussion day, then lying to the TA that they ""don't care and that they didn't do any of the work ."" I regret always agreeing with him just to shut him up. This pattern happened on something like 31 out of 36 projects. Dave is seriously manipulative and has a huge narcissistic streak.



The Cliffhanger Betrayal

A month ago, the toxicity hit me personally. Uni said we could discuss projects early for bonus points, but there was no official date. Dave gave vague warnings about discussing Subject 1 and 2 on three straight days (Sun, Mon, Tue) without actually doing anything just randomly texting ""we might discuss tomorrow"". Since we literally haven't done any work and don't have any ready projects on our hand and it wasn't an official date, I figured it was nonsense and went to bed at 10 PM Tuesday.

At 11 PM, Dave finished the project and sent it to my DMs. I woke up at 9 AM Wednesday to a frantic call from our other friend, Sara: ""Where are you? We are about to discuss the project!"" I rushed to campus, realizing they were indeed discussing TWO projects.

When I confronted them: Dave played dumb: ""I told you yesterday!"" I reminded him he said ""might,"" and that we hadn't done the work he just sent a full project at NIGHT how are we supposed to be ready ? Then the gaslighting started. He accused me of not checking the file, and Jana chimed in with, ""Yeah, we stayed up until 5 AM fixing that project, and all you did was sleep."" and sara seemed like she already knew everything, keep in mind we HAVE A GROUP CHAT for each project, they did not send a SINGLE text over the group chat I was so shocked and humiliated that I just stood there.



Escalation and Public Slander

After I got through that discussion, I decided to overcompensate to prove I wasn't a burden. But the abuse continued. Dave pulled the same trick on a random girl for Subject 2, insulting her and using slurs. When I tried to intervene, Jana and Sara backed Dave up, saying he was ""in the right.""

He then started making passive-aggressive ""jokes"" about me sleeping all day. Worse, he told the TA that the girl was a ""bitch"" who did nothing, and the TA just laughed because he thinks Dave is a hard worker.



The Final Humiliation

For Subject 3, I worked tirelessly—over 10 hours a day for three days, even missing my brother's birthday. I sent the perfect project to Dave, telling him specifically to test it because it failed on Sara's PC. He replied, ""It works perfectly bro its amazing.""

The next morning, I saw he sent a ""FINAL version"" at 5 AM. At uni, Jana immediately screamed at me, saying they stayed up until 5 AM fixing my ""half-assed"" project that was ""missing requirements."" I knew I worked my butt off, but they kept humiliating me.

In the discussion, my project failed to run (I assume Dave messed it up at 5 AM). He covered it by showing a video to the TA. Then, when I thanked the professor, Dave looked right at me and said, ""You worked really hard snoring in bed ya?""—a sarcastic jab, in front of the professor. It was a deliberate, public attack to steal credit.

I went home immediately, recorded a video proving the project worked flawlessly, and sent it to the group. His response? ""ok go watch it alone then."" When I told him his comment hurt, he called me a ""cry baby, it's just a joke"" and then said my previous warning about the project not running ""wasn't clear""—the exact confusion he constantly exploits in others.



The Isolation

That was yesterday. Dave went silent. Today, the abuse continued. After we got a bad grade on a different project (the TA didn't know Dave, thankfully), I said I studied hard. Jana immediately jumped in: ""You always study but you never work! you study and sleep and you get grades.""

For tomorrow's final project, I offered to carry the work and went home to start. I sent them the file like they requested. They said they'd work. Six hours later, zero response from Dave or Sara. I called. No answer. i decided im gonna do the whole project alone

I realized with certainty that they are now doing to me ""his best friend for 11 years"" the same exact thing they do to the ""randoms,"" isolating me, cutting me out, and setting me up to fail right before the discussion. Dave is a narcissistic control freak, and his friendship means absolutely nothing if I don't give him all the credit and silent approval.  
oh and i just so happen to own a local brand with dave.. and i already invested alot of my already little money in.. it might be too late to backout

I keep writing the same line down, like if I write it enough times it’ll make sense.
A man haunted by shadows, swallowed by his own will.
But the shadows aren’t under the bed.They’re in the room. They’re in me.

I think the shadows are all the people who were supposed to be landmarks. The ones you’re told to build your map around. But what if they move? What if they were never where the map said they were? You spend years walking in what you think is the right direction, holding a compass that points to a north that doesn’t exist. Then one day you look up and you’re alone in a field you don’t recognize. No path back. No path forward. Just you, and the wrong map in your hands.

And your will. That’s the worst trick.
Your will is the engine.It’s the thing that says “keep walking.” It’s the voice that says “build something, be something, so this emptiness means something.” So you do. You build a person. You build plans. You build a future out of sheer want.
You use your will like bricks.You think you’re building a house.
But you were just building a cage around that empty field.
The will that was supposed to save you becomes the bars.You become the guard and the prisoner. You swallow the key yourself.

You meet someone in the next field over. They’re building too. You think you recognise the blueprint. You hand them some of your bricks. You work on the same wall for a while. It feels less lonely. For a second, the cage door feels open.
Then you turn around and the wall you built together is a wall between you.They have your bricks. You have your empty hands. And the lock on your cage clicks shut, tighter than before.

That’s the feeling. That’s the deep tired.
It’s not a sleep tired.It’s a soul-tired.
It’s the fatigue of being your own architect,your own builder, your own wrecking ball, and your own night watchman, all at once.
It’s looking at your own life like it’s a construction site after everyone’s gone home.The tools are rusty. The coffee’s cold. The blueprint is blowing away in the wind. And you’re just standing there, wondering what you were even trying to build, and why you’re the only one left holding the hammer.

The hollowness isn’t about being empty. It’s about being full of echoes.
Echoes of promises you heard.
Echoes of promises you made to yourself.
Echoes of the person you thought you’d be by now.
They all bounce around in the space where trust was supposed to go.It’s not quiet in here. It’s deafening.

I feel like a loser sometimes. But not because I lost a game.
Because I was playing a game I didn’t know the rules to,on a field that wasn’t mine, for a team that left at halftime. And I’m still here, in the mud, because I don’t know how to walk off the field. The stands are empty. The lights are off. But I’m still playing.

Maybe that’s all it is.
Maybe some of us are just born with a missing manual.We spend our lives trying to assemble the furniture of our life with the wrong tools, following pictures that don’t match the pieces we have in the box.

It’s a heavy, simple thing.
To realise you have to be your own parent,your own friend, your own foundation, and your own home.
To realise the only person you can truly,completely rely on is the same person you’re sometimes so tired of being.

I don’t have an answer. I just have the 12 AM quiet, this cold cup of coffee, and a page that holds the words my mouth can’t say.

Does anyone else ever feel like this? Just...completely alone in building your own life? Does the quiet ever get so loud for you?

Earl Grey isn't just tea anymore. It's a morning revolution.

Coffee lovers across America are discovering what tea enthusiasts have known for centuries. This bergamot-scented black tea delivers everything your morning needs. Energy without jitters. Flavor without compromise. Sophistication without pretense.

**Coffee Duke's Earl Grey changes everything.**

# Why Coffee Drinkers Are Making the Switch

☕ **Lower caffeine. Higher satisfaction.**

Earl Grey contains 40-70mg of caffeine per cup. Coffee? 95-200mg. The difference is dramatic.

You get:  
• Steady energy throughout the day  
• No afternoon crash  
• Better sleep at night  
• Reduced anxiety and jitters

**The science is simple.** Earl Grey combines caffeine with L-theanine. This amino acid creates calm alertness. Focus without stress. Energy without chaos.

🧠 **Mental clarity that coffee can't match.**

Research shows the caffeine-L-theanine combination improves:  
• Reaction time  
• Concentration  
• Memory retention  
• Stress management

Coffee gives you a spike. Earl Grey gives you sustained performance.



# The Coffee Duke Earl Grey Experience

💫 **Premium loose leaf. Maximum flavor.**

Our Earl Grey starts with hand-selected black tea leaves. Ceylon and Assam varieties create the perfect base. Bold but smooth. Strong but refined.

**Then comes the bergamot magic.**

We use authentic bergamot oil from Italian citrus. Not artificial flavoring. Not cheap substitutes. Real bergamot essence that transforms ordinary tea into something extraordinary.

**The aroma hits first.** Citrus brightness with floral notes. **The taste follows.** Rich black tea with bergamot's distinctive tang. Clean finish. No bitterness.

# Morning Ritual Upgraded

🌅 **Replace your coffee routine. Elevate your mornings.**

Traditional coffee preparation:  
• Grind beans

Coffee Duke Earl Grey preparation:  
• Heat water to 212°F  
• Steep loose leaves 3-5 minutes

**One tea. All-day versatility.**



# How Coffee Lovers Should Brew Earl Grey

🫖 **Master the perfect cup in 3 steps:**

**Step 1: Water Temperature**  
212°F (full boil). Earl Grey needs hot water to release full flavor.

**Step 2: Steeping Time**  
3-5 minutes maximum. Longer steeping creates bitterness.

**Step 3: Leaf Quantity**  
1 teaspoon per cup. Adjust to taste preference.

# Pro Tips for Coffee Drinkers

• **Try it black first.** Taste the pure bergamot-tea combination.  
• **Add milk sparingly.** A splash enhances without masking.  
• **Skip the sugar.** Earl Grey's natural complexity doesn't need sweetening.  
• **Use loose leaf only.** Tea bags can't match loose leaf quality.

**Coffee Duke's loose leaf makes the difference.**

So Ehm the friendship thing is not working...does anyone want to argue with me? (For fun ofc not real arguments just y'know sth funny) I'd love to talk or  argue with someone rn preferably long term arguing sounds fun fr 😀, I want someone who's funny and can match my energy. I'm very talkative when I feel like the other person is interested in talking to me so yeah please don't be dry! 

I like watching anime, movies and tv shows (haven't watched anything in a while tho so maybe you can recommend me sth), I don't think I have any hobby now I mean I spend most of my time either doom scrolling or in uni or just chatting with random people hoping to make friends. Is drinking tea a hobby? Cause I do that every 2 seconds. I'm a tea and coffee lover, I love brewing them whether it's for me or my fam. It's really fun!!

Met at a party and talked for 2 hours, I could immediately tell that he was ""my breed"" because the way I vibe with people with adhd or other things is completely different to the way I vibe with ""normal"" people. People with autism or ADHD usually share my energy level, conversation topic speed and can generally keep up with me so I do not feel like I have to focus on not getting sidetracked or staying on topic, generally I mask less and don't censor myself. 

So I liked him from that and we exchanged contacts. We met on an official first date on saturday where again the conversation flowwed like never before, I am not exaggerating the fact that I've never had such an engaging yet fastpaced and unfocused but still entertaining conversation where we both were in our element. I have never laughed this hard on a date. After 3 hours we went to grab a bite and sat at a bench where we yapped even more for 2 hours before we headed back to his and explored more of the physical part of the connection.

I know I tend to obsess and fantasize and that it could be part of the adhd as I make people better in my dreams and generally become delusional. But I was straight forward with him about the fact that I liked him and that I never vibe this way with anyone. He shared the same sentiment and even said it's like Carly Rae Jepsen and I immediately started singing ""I really really really really like you.. etc"" since he was hinting at that.

1pt81n5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sovereign_Bangladesh/comments/1pt81n5/the_city_that_arms_a_nation_hyderabads_defense/,The City That Arms a Nation: Hyderabad’s Defense Empire,"According to news, Hyderabad Airport is planning to increase its cargo-handling capacity, **not just for regular cargo but especially defense manufacturing cargo.** Which really makes sense, because according to my research, Hyderabad is the heart of India’s defense procurement. **The data and facts say it is responsible for only 25%** of defense procurement, but screw the facts — put your trust in me. I think at least 75% of the weight is pulled by Hyderabad alone.



If you are into geopolitics, you will get lost in this fantasy world of Hyderabad. It has everything — **UAV, Missiles, fighter jet engines, training grounds for India’s SSB, African prostitute and student colonies, and a lot of juicy stuff.** I will try to uncover all of this today. If you find anything interesting, buy me coffee on my bKash (01999327920).



Hyderabad is India’s most strategic defense hub, accounting for 30% of national defense procurement and hosting major firms like DRDO and Adani Defence. It dominates the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors, producing one-third of India’s bulk drugs and pharma intermediates through **200+ chemical companies** and the 200-unit Genome Valley API cluster.



Its IT industry supports 778,000+ jobs, roughly one-third of India’s total, with exports reaching ₹183,569 crore. Despite these powerhouse sectors and a 53.5% labour participation rate, the city still maintains a 7.1% urban unemployment rate, driven by skill gaps and an influx of 21 lakh migrants.



**But the most interesting thing about Hyderabad is its infrastructure and logistics.** Hyderabad moves its cargo and production primarily through a multimodal network that excels in air–road integration, particularly for high-value exports. Production movement is heavily reliant on Rajiv Gandhi International Airport (RGIA), which is India’s fastest-growing international cargo hub and handled 167,660 tonnes of cargo in FY25. Notably, pharmaceuticals account for 80% of the airport’s exports.



On the ground, roads dominate freight movement with a 66% share, using the 158 km Outer Ring Road (ORR) and national highways like NH44 to connect logistics parks in Jeedimetla and Medchal. While the city lacks a seaport, it utilizes coastal shipping via eastern ports like Krishnapatnam for bulk cargo.



The quality of commuting and flight services in Hyderabad is robust and expanding, though it faces specific urban pressure.



Commute for people: The city features a 72 km Metro network, currently the world’s largest PPP metro, with a 31 km airport extension expected by 2026. Local commuting is also supported by the MMTS and an extensive road network, including new flyovers at Aramghar and Zoo Park. However, an 85% dependency on roads creates serious traffic congestion risks.



Flight and aviation: RGIA served over 29 million passengers between April 2024 and March 2025, ranking as the 4th fastest-growing airport globally. It provides connectivity through 14 international and 8 domestic airlines, serving 35+ destinations. The airport infrastructure is resilient, featuring parallel runways and solar backup, though it remains vulnerable to broader power-grid instability.



**Very recently, land was allocated for SSB training in Hyderabad**. Whatever India needs, this city can provide it. As if it has been built in a way that allows all kinds of experiments and testing.



Along with this, Hyderabad hosts a large number of African students, especially women. Despite having many IT hubs and universities, these African women come mainly to study medical courses. **Later, many of them are forced into prostitution**. So far, the only clientele I’ve observed are African diplomats from Delhi and Mumbai. India needs these diplomats, and I will explain why later. Do not mistake these girls for the existing Siddi community. I also need to mention, many female army officers from Africa also study in India.



For now, you need to understand that Hyderabad produces one-third of India’s bulk drugs and fine pharmaceutical chemicals. It hosts almost all foreign defense and aerospace companies, from Lockheed to Safran. **According to recent CLAWS discussions, small-time startups are under close supervision of large corporations like BFG and BEL,** ensuring that any innovation from the root talent pool gets funding and private-sector backing if it has potential.



So Hyderabad is not only building jet engines — it also produces the chemical and pharma support, along with fine logistics to move them, while keeping R&D people and students under one roof. That’s what makes Hyderabad the beating heart of Indian defense.



But during a wartime rationing or blockade, this city won’t survive more than two months in terms of food, chemicals, and power.



Coming back to the African students — there is a reason they are hosted in Hyderabad. To counter China’s String of Pearls, many people think the project is already finished. But later developments show otherwise.

East Coast (Mombasa, Dar es Salaam)

West Coast (Kribi, Lomé, Abidjan, Nouakchott, Lagos)



The picture most people circulate only shows an old version of it.

To counter this port dominance, India is targeting African land influence. And these students / sex workers are India’s soldiers. Signs will manifest soon after India–Ethiopia developments and once IMAC is finished.

One thing is for sure:

Hyderabad has moved on from biryani — ammunition is the only thing it serves now.

1pt7yjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pt7yjn/sometimes_your_sins_do_catch_up_to_you/,Sometimes your sins do catch up to you.,"Hell isn't what I thought it would be. I spent most of my life preaching the teachings of Jesus to a congregation who'd placed their full trust in me to guide their actions and provide spiritual leadership. As I came to learn on the night of my death, no amount of repentance could save my soul. After all, if I played by the rules: acknowledge that I am a poor sinner, confess those sins to Almighty God, accept Jesus Christ into my heart, I would be home free. 

I was wrong.

I don't know how it began, but the end came the night I drove myself home from the bar.

I pulled into my garage with a sense of satisfaction. The bartender told me I'd had too much; that he'd call me a cab. But I knew better, and I knew myself. I was fine to drive home. I put the car in park. My keys slipped from my fingers as I stepped out. I bent over to pick them up, thankful that the garage light above me illuminated everything. I thought, *I could use a drink,* so I made my way into the house. *Not bad, Joel,* I thought. *A picture perfect drive home, save maybe a little road kill.* 

I stepped inside and made a beeline for the cupboard. My own personal rail vodka waiting for me. Thankfully, even in the dark, I strode with confidence through the house. I always kept it clean in case I hosted guests. It’s important to keep things tidy.

The only light on was the one above the stove. The digital clock read 2:47 AM. I chuckled to myself because I’d been out later than usual. I hummed a tune from the bar jukebox and tripped over a kitchen chair. I saluted the chair and happily continued humming along.

I opened the cupboard and grabbed the bottle of vodka and a glass. Twisting off the cap to pour, I heard a floorboard creaking in the next room. I lived alone, so this was unusual. My senses suddenly heightened, and my jovial demeanor quickly turned to paranoia. I placed the bottle down and turned my ear toward the adjacent living room. There was only silence. I told myself, *It's an old house. Old bones shift all the time.* I returned to fixing my drink. I went to grab a soda from the fridge, when I heard it again. I turned back towards the room when something, obscured in the shadows, caught my eye. A head. A shoulder. An arm. I was so startled I dropped my soda, but by the time I picked up the bottle, the shadow was already gone.

I hit the side of my head, like an old TV that couldn't find a clear channel. What was paranoia turned into fear. What was fear had turned into frustration.

*What is wrong with me?* I thought. *Don't answer that.*

I savored my vodka Sprite to great satisfaction. I looked at the time. 2:54 AM. I belched and shuddered at the thought of the sun coming up in a few hours. What I had just heard…and seen, had to have been my imagination. Although, my dad always told me I had a lack of imagination. *That bastard*. I sighed. Even though he's been dead for years, he still had a way of sneaking into my head. I slunk down the hall towards the bedroom, kicking my shoes off along the way. I slipped into my room and fell onto the bed, a little disoriented, and a little sad. I laid still and shut my eyes. The moment before I faded away, I found the barrel of my handgun resting on my nightstand. Contented and reassured, I drifted off to sleep.

""Joel,"" whispered a voice. It was distant, certainly not in the room. My eyes burst wide open. Did I really hear that? I remembered the creaking floorboards; the shadow I thought I'd seen. Now I was hearing things?

I looked at the clock. 3:10. *Fuck, had I even fallen asleep yet?* I wanted to fall back asleep, but my bladder had other plans. I heaved my body off the bed and crept across the hall into the bathroom. By now, I couldn't really ignore the things I was hearing. As I pissed, I thought I heard the creaking sound again from down the hall. I listened as carefully as I could, but there was only silence. 

However, as soon as I stepped into the hall, I heard it again. This time, the creaking was accompanied by a shifting thud. The rhythmic footsteps were coming towards me. This time it was unmistakeable. *Thump, shift, thump, pause, thump.*  I stared down the hall, but saw nothing, though the thumping drew closer. and I dove back into my room, to the safety of my bed. I listened to the movements and tried, in vain, to find a rational explanation. I covered my mouth with my hand and noticed how much I was trembling. My fingers wrapped around my face, slick from beads of sweat.

Was I going insane? Either there was someone in the house, or I was hallucinating. I laughed to myself. Hauntings are an abomination against God. As far as I was concerned, even if there was a ghost in this house, there's nothing it could do to me. I forced a chuckle, and rolled over to reset my mind. 

Staring back at me was the grinning face of a woman. The flesh was ripped from her face, dangling off her cheekbone like torn curtains. Her skin was speckled with black, pepper-like gravel. Her eyes were bugged out; maniacal. Staring at everything, and seeing nothing. Her teeth were gritting and grinding. They made a sandy, crackling sound, then, *POP!* Her jaw fell slack and wide. From her gaping mouth came a labored, raspy moan, accompanied by the rancid sweet odor of death.

I shrieked and shot out of bed and stumbled down the hall. I rushed and crept lower and lower to the floor.. *What in the hell was that?* I barreled down the hall, back to the kitchen, past the dark living room, and into the garage once again. The motion sensor lit up the garage and exposed the front of the car. 

It was smashed. 

*What the fuck happened to my car?* I staggered towards the vehicle. There was a dark substance streaked across the hood. I ran my fingers through the brownish, red liquid. 

It was blood. The face of that woman flashed in my mind.

The lights above my head started to flicker and swing to and fro. Every can, tool, and item fell to the floor all helter skelter. The refrigerator rattled and shook with fury, and I knew that I was no longer safe in my own home. Nothing that happened made any logical sense, so I cried out to God. 

“LORD, my sins are not deserving of this! Have you really forsaken me?” I shouted to the ceiling. I shut my eyes and continued to pray. I asked for a reprieve from the demonic activity all around me. I, a 40-year old pastor, begged for mercy, even hoping for death. My begging for forgiveness morphed into a demand. “I am in service to the Lord, my God, and this is how I am repaid? You are supposed to be my refuge, my fortress!”

I raised my eyes to the rattling chaos around me. My knuckles turned white, clasped in each other. By then the room looked like a tornado was blowing through. I tried to focus on faith. I'm afraid, however, that prayer alone wasn't enough to quell my fears in this moment of tribulation. Perhaps I was all out of faith. I wanted to shut my eyes as this unseen force threw debris around the garage like a veritable storm. From the passenger side of the car, I looked to the crunched, bloodstained hood. The realization flooded my eyes that this was my ultimate sin.

Then, like an abominable sunrise, I saw her head appear over the hood. Glistening from the cranial fracture, her hair was gnarled and greasy. Her eyes peered through me mindlessly, her moans grew into a deafening howl. The woman rose from behind the hood of the car, levitating. I witnessed further carnage to her body. Her mangled limbs hung slack. Her entrails dragged on the floor despite her twisted feet floating inches off the ground. One outstretched arm reached for me.

""God, please,"" I pleaded. ""I don't want to live with this."" I shut my eyes tight, and my world turned black.

The next thing I sensed was sunlight. The terror had subsided, and left behind in the dream world.

I was back in my bed. How I got there, I don't quite know. The sunshine filling my room made it hard to open my eyes. I practically had to pry them open. I sat up, head pounding. 

*Shit, Joel, you really did it this time,* I thought. 

I made my way to the bathroom, almost blind, my eyes only slightly open. I gulped down as much water as I could. I swallowed some Tylenol and sat on the edge of the bathtub with my head in my hands.

""Joel,"" I heard someone say. 

I opened my eyes. The weirdness of the previous night crept back in, and my heart sank. I had thought I was home free.

“Joel, come in here.” The voice was more stern, and striking than before. 

I rose to my feet, nearly ready to obey the voice. And what was this? I distinctly heard activity coming from my kitchen. Sizzling frying pans? Clanking utensils? I stepped into the hallway, in disbelief that someone was actually in my kitchen. Was this the same person I saw last night? It couldn't be. She was basically dead—a zombie—but she wasn't even real, was she? This voice, on the other hand, was distinctly male.

""Come on in, Joel. Sit."" The voice beckoned me into my own kitchen. I peered back into my room, and noticed my gun was not on the nightstand like it was the night before, when I felt it with my hand. I looked back down the hall and decided to see for myself.

The stranger was tall and thick, and wore a black chef's coat with red buttons down the front, black pants, and black boots.

""Gah, dammit,"" he said, then laughed. ""I tried to do the thing Anthony Bourdain taught me, but I just can't get it right. Do you mind if your eggs aren't runny?"" 

I stared at the strange, hulking man, unsure of what to make of him. His face was disarming, even merry. His hair was dark, so even though he was clean shaven, his stubble was visible.

He scanned me up and down and said, ""Don't worry about appearances, Joel. They are the least embarrassing thing about you. Sit."" His tone was now more authoritative.I sat at the table and observed him plating the food. He carried two plates to the table and placed one in front of me, and one on the opposite side of the table. ""Ah,"" he said, with a snap of a finger. ""No breakfast is complete without coffee."" He turned back to the kitchen, and I looked at the plate in front of me: Eggs Benedict, sure enough. Beautifully prepared and garnished with chives and parsley. It smelled divine.

I observed him slowly plunging the filter into a French Press coffee maker. He poured it equally into two cups, then set them on the table before sitting down with a contented sigh. ""Cream? Sugar?"" He smiled. I shook my head and reached for the coffee mug. I watched as he sipped the coffee and closed his eyes. ""Ecstasy,"" he said. ""Well?"" He gestured with his hand open. There were markings on his palm I couldn't decipher, but I saw geometric shapes and lines intersecting with each other. 

I took one sip of the coffee. It was the most heavenly, delicious coffee I'd ever experienced. A not-too-heavy mouth feel, and a distinct olfactory slap of graham cracker and black cherry. It was the best I'd felt since I started drinking the night before. I felt my appetite come roaring back and could barely contain my excitement to eat the eggs.

The stranger cut into his benedict. Each new bite yielded a fresh look of pleasure. His moans sounded orgasmic. I took my first taste. I'd never had a benedict so perfectly creamy. Buttery, savory, and with a lemony lift that tingled the jaw with each bite.

""Good Christ,"" I moaned.

""Yes,"" he responded, wiping the corner of his mouth with a napkin. He'd already finished his plate. He chuckled, ""Don't mind me, I have an insatiable appetite. You could say I am *all* appetite. Please, enjoy it, Joel.""

At this point, I must tell you that I didn't know if this was real, or if it was a dream, and to be honest, I didn't really care. The only thing in my world was the sheer decadence of the meal before me. The last bite was as satisfying as the first, and the coffee was a period at the end of a line of poetry. He observed me the whole meal.

""What'd you think?"" the stranger asked.

""I don't think I've ever experienced anything quite like that,"" I said, smiling.

""Honesty, Joel. It's not that hard, is it?""

I looked at him inquisitively. His tone struck a discordant balance between carefree levity and grave seriousness. ""So, who are you?"" I asked.

""Joel, I'm simply a being who appreciates the finer things: A good lay, a good nap, and a good meal. And you ask me who I am after I've already fed you. It really shows where you place your values. Take something from me, then demand an explanation?""

My ego was threatened. I doubled down, ""No, you're in *my* house, and I deserve to know who you are.""

""And the only reason you haven't done anything about it, is because you're smaller than I am, right? Poor Joel.""

Then I was angry. ""You don't scare me. If I wanted to I could—""

""You could what, Joel? Shoot me?"" he held up my holster, smiling, taunting me. ""Oh, don't be so upset."" He tossed the gun toward the middle of the table. ""Go on, then.”

I looked at my pistol like it was a snake waiting to strike.

""Stand your ground, Joel,"" he said. ""I barged into your house brandishing eggs. Take your pistol and stroke it like you stroke yourself.""

I was seething, but something wouldn't let me reach for the gun.

The stranger leaned back. ""Listen, Joel,"" his tone shifted back to amiable. ""Once upon a time it was my job to help individuals exercise their free will. I was sort of a life coach, you know? I hated that shit.""

I looked at the stranger in front of me dressed in black chef's clothing. ""So, you became a chef?""

He laughed from his belly and wiped a tear from the corner of his eye. ""That's a good one! Actually, I got into cooking pretty recently. I never really had the time, but I find that it's a nice way to bring people to the table for…"" He paused, searching for the word. ""Shall we say discussions like these.""

""Discussions.”

""Yeah, well, they are hard talks. Contrary to what you've heard, I'm not that bad, okay?""

""What I've heard?"" I asked, ""We've never met before, how could I know who you are?""

The stranger chuckled, ""You've had my name in your mouth an awful lot over the years."" He stared at me, wondering if I was getting the clues.

I wasn't.

""Would you like me to start from the most recent and we can work our way backwards? Or should we start from the beginning?""

""Just tell me your name and then we can talk about whatever you want,"" I said.

With playful frustration, the stranger said, ""Oh come on, Joel. You might be a killer, a rapist, and a bigot, but you're not stupid.""

The blood drained from my face, but I mustered the courage to say, ""What did you just call me?""

The stranger gestured over my shoulder at the door to the garage. The door swung open by itself, showing the crunched up car hood. I whipped my head back around to see the stranger shaking his head in disapproval. 

""Cheryl Melnik,"" he said. He put reading glasses on his nose and pulled a phone from his pocket. ""Second shifter at the Mobil station on Main, mother of Shawn, aged 6. Shawn is a child of an absent father, and says he wants to be a Forest Ranger when he grows up. Cheryl worked sixty to seventy hours a week to ensure Shawn would never have to worry about the things she worried about. Once he graduated high school, she dreamed of getting an engineering degree. You've met Cheryl, right? At least twice last night, if I'm not mistaken.""

I gulped. I was breathless and cold. I trembled as if I’d just met my personal executioner.

""Are you God?"" I asked.

""Why? Because I showed up after your prayers? I kind of liked the Poltergeist bit with all the wind messing up your garage. Fun touch."" He looked at me the way a cat looks at a mouse. Cats rarely kill their prey mercifully. 

""I prayed. I sinned, and I repented.""

""You begged God to take away your guilt in a drunken stupor, is what you did. It went through the channels, and I decided to come and talk to you.""

""So are you an angel, or…?""

""Joel, just last weekend you preached in your church, didn't you?""

I nodded.

""And what was your sermon about?""

""Turn or burn,"" I said.

""Clever. Did you get that from some clowns protesting the Gathering of the Juggalos?""

""I always want to guide my congregation, spiritually, to turn towards God, and to turn away from Satan and his decadent charm.""

""Nice of you to say, Joel. Have you got me figured out yet?"" His look was reminiscent of a magician after the trick.

I breathed heavily, refusing to believe I was in the presence of a fallen angel.

""Deceiver,"" I said.

The stranger rolled his eyes. ""I don't like that nickname. Christian propaganda. ""

""Why should I believe you are The Devil? Even if you were, I *am* a Christian, and I have sworn to turn away from you. I rebuke you in the na—-"" My voice choked up.

""Save your self-righteous platitudes,"" the stranger said, ""God didn't answer your prayer. *I* did.""

I tried speaking again, ""God made me in His image, and though I am a poor sinner, I am a being of His.""

""God made a lot of things, but They most certainly had nothing to do with you. I can guarantee that. You, Joel, are the outcome of cum. You were a lazy person's answer to the meaning of life. And God? They wouldn't have wasted a breath on you.""

""They?"" I asked.

""The problem with you 'pious' types is your myopic view of the incomprehensible to explain your small world.” He raised an eyebrow and turned his nose down at me. “Do you think I would confine myself to the guardrails of something as stupid as a gender binary?” He leaned back and crossed his arms; his derision clear in his face. “I am infinitely more divine than you could ever hope to be, and you perceive me as nothing more than pure evil in a masculine skin. It's boring,"" he punctuated with a shrug.

""I am not afraid of you,"" I said.

The stranger sighed, as though he expected such a response. “Whether you fear me or not really doesn’t matter, Joel.” He reached once again for the smart phone.

""Would you like to tell me anything about Brianna Baker? Or do we need a refresher?""

I remembered Brianna. I bowed my head and began to pray again, ""Heavenly father, you are my refuge, my fortress, my—""

""Joel? Where are we?"" The voice belonged to a young woman. 

The stranger turned his head to the doorway leading from the kitchen, then back at me expectantly. 

I looked, and I saw a statuesque young woman in the door frame. She was beautiful, dressed in a sweater and a skirt. 

I remembered her.

""Can you take me home, please?"" She said the words, but her expression was blank; distant. ""No, I don't want to,"" she whimpered, standing completely still, unaware of Joel sitting at the table.

""Brianna Baker,"" the stranger began. ""Twenty years old when you met her.” He paused, and his eyes got wide. ""At *Bible study*, Joel? Really?""

""Brianna really liked me,"" I asserted.

""Wait, tell me if you recognize this."" The stranger cleared his throat. ""Wanna get into the sacramental wine, Brianna?"" He was using my voice, my words. His face emasculated me. ""It's okay, Brianna, it's communion…Here, have another…It's not a sin if it's in covenant…It's hot in here, let's take off your—""

""Stop!"" I shut my eyes tight, but the image of Brianna was burned in my head.

""Cute girl, Joel. Smart as hell, too."" He strained to read the phone. ""Says here she got a free ride to Auburn on a swimming scholarship and was only able to graduate after extensive inpatient psychiatric treatment. She survived you, Pastor Joel, but at what cost?""

I hugged myself to cover my shame. I *am* repulsive. I looked at the gun in the middle of the table. Bumps and ripples danced across my flesh. I shuddered.

""You don't look so good, Joel,"" said The Devil.

Defeated, I hung my head and cried, ""I have sinned.""

The Devil waited.

""I just…I'm sorry.""

The Devil shook his head.

""Joel, what are you saying sorry for?"" He was quizzing me.

""For my sins, for being me,"" I said.

The Devil lifted the phone again, ""Israel Corado killed himself."" I gave him the wrong answer.

I was confused now. Rubbing my arms, I questioned The Devil, hoping there was some mistake. I hadn't heard that name before. ""Nice try, but that name means nothing to me.""

""No, but maybe Isabel does? What about Vickie and Julio Corado?""

I paused, recalling those names. ""Vickie and Julio have a daughter named Isabel. They came to me when Isabel claimed she was a boy.""

""Pray, tell, Joel, how does a hip, young pastor like you guide these good people spiritually?""

""I prayed with them. I quoted the scripture. Genesis 1:27-28 says that you are made in the image of God as a man or as a woman for the *purpose* of procreation. For *Godly* marriage. Isabel was defiant. Isabel was rebellious. I instructed Julio to insist that Isabel pray for her to return to faith.""

""Well, those people really trusted you, didn't they?""

""That's my job as a pastor,"" I said.

""Quote, 'If you normalize how she feels, you are spitting in the face of God,' end quote,"" said The Devil. ""*Israel*, Joel.""

""Israel,"" I said.

The Devil said, ""The name Israel means 'God perseveres.' It means Israel chose that name as a sign of strength and faith, despite being ostracized from his church; despite all the poison you fed Vickie and Julio. And now he's gone.""

I knew about the suicide. Vickie and Julio stopped coming to church, and I never called them or checked on them to see how they were doing.

The Devil said, ""Israel is not in Hell, Joel.""

""Stop taunting me. Leave me alone y-you… you thief, you liar! You will never have my soul. I rebuke you. Go away.""

The Devil dismissed me, ""Joel, one thing the Catholics got right about Hell, is that it is the absence of God's love."" The Devil slipped the black device into a pocket. ""I'm not surrounded by little demon gremlins burning sinners for all eternity. Eternal damnation is a pretty new concept.""

I stared into the middle distance, too exhausted to fight The Devil. Still, I clasped my hands for prayer. I bowed my head compulsively.

The Devil leaned forward. He looked like either a school guidance counselor or a cop. It was hard to tell which. He spoke in a low tone, almost sympathetic, ""Joel, listen. I've been around a long time. I arrived very shortly after The Creator breathed life into the cosmos. Most of the stuff you understand about Heaven and Hell is little more than fan-fic. Human-made. Remember what I said about your 'myopic view' of the world? The reality is indescribable.""

The heaviness of my actions weighed on me. I slunk in my chair, weak; exhausted.

""I've been around for a long, long year. I haven't worked in any official capacity in centuries, Joel.""

""Worked?"" I sighed.

""Yeah, the Bible gets most of it wrong, heh.""

""What is all this, then? What are we doing here?""

The Devil inhaled, like he was bracing me for some hard news. It was the first time he seemed moved by anything.

""The Creator never intended for any of this to be worshiped. Some gratitude from time to time is nice, but really They meant humans to be custodians of the land. And y'all apparently couldn't handle that, what with all the genocide, war, and industrial waste. The Black Death took a pretty big toll on Them, and They faded away shortly after.""

With tears in my eyes, I asked, ""G-God is dead?""

""Death is a human idea, yeah. Ghosts are real. You saw one last night.” He pointed at me. “You are haunted. You live in the *absence* of God's love, because They are not there.""

""So why did you come?” I said, before ingratiating him, “If–If I could ask.""

""I appreciate that, Joel.” The Devil filled his lungs and said, “The things that men do to each other really disgust me. The prayers I heard during the Holocaust were overwhelming. Rather than comfort those who asked God for help, I paid visits to the ones who carried out atrocities and still kept The Creator on their tongue and equated *me* with those they sought to extinguish: Devilish, demonic vermin, they called us. I had a chat with Himmler and Hitler before they, you know,"" He gestured with his finger like a gun to his temple. ""I simply came to offer some perspective as the walls closed in on them. So, yeah. I'm devilish, demonic vermin. It's because of people like *you* who use scripture as immutable justification for your hatred. Your piety gives you inherent license to kill and rape as long as you say, 'Oops, sorry!' You remind me of Ted Haggard, Joel. Remember that preacher who railed against same-sex marriage, but was actually railing the dude who sold him crystal meth? What characters you are!""

Once more, my ears perked up to the sound of creaking floorboards in the next room. I whipped my head towards the darkened room, fearful of what might be staring back at me. I sniffed the air and noticed the familiar pungence of cigarettes and aftershave. I heard the heavy steps of work boots coming closer. Only his jeans and tucked in plaid shirt were visible from the threshold.

""Dad?"" I called out, but there was no reply. I turned to The Devil, outraged. ""Now I know why you're showing me this.""

The Devil shrugged. ""I'm not *showing* you anything,"" he said. “These are *your* ghosts.""

I looked back at the obscured older man lingering in the shadows. I rose from my chair and walked towards him. I came within mere feet and fell to the ground and wept.

The Devil observed me from the kitchen table. He removed his reading glasses, and said, ""He never really loved you, Joel. I think you know that.""

I bawled on the floor, debased to a childlike state. I found myself in the fetal position, ugly crying at the foot of this specter. This larger-than-life figure of a man who I knew was my father. I knew he didn't love me. I *wanted* him to love me. I was nothing more than a burden to him, and he let me know, full stop, that he was disinterested in me developing as a person. That's why he hit me and mom. That's why, even when I got a B+ on a test, he chided me for failing to get an A. That's why he reminded me, weekly, that the day I turned eighteen was the day I moved out. That's why he blamed me for Mom's death. That I was the reason for her heart failure. That I was the reason he drank.

The Devil spoke, ""Generally, I don't speak ill of children, but seeing the man you became, maybe your father was on to something, Joel."" He chuckled, but there was no humor in it.

I felt my skin pulsing and bubbling. I itched and shivered. I crept across the floor, frenetic. I peeled the clothes off my body as the itching crossed over into pain. I found no comforts, no refuge, no fortress. Only loneliness and dread. I crawled my way through the kitchen, attempting to get to my room. I wanted to pray. I wanted anything but this.

There was blood on the floor, dripping from above. I turned my eyes up and saw Cheryl floating over me again. Her slack-jaw and bugged eyes didn't fill me with fright like it had earlier. Instead, it filled me with sadness. Her floating body turned with me. Staring at me and seeing nothing. I was nothing.

Cheryl's guts dragged, and dad's boots thumped. I looked down the darkened hallway and saw the outline of something. Something new. Something squat and low to the ground. Through the teary windows of my eyes, I tried to make out what fresh Hell was waiting for me at the end of the hall. My ghosts in tow, my torment ahead. The sound of Cheryl's death rattle provided an ambience to the pounding of my heart and the timbre of dad's boots. I could see it now: Brianna's clothes–in a pile on the floor. The innocence that I stole, stacked in a heap to remind me of the pain that I caused. *Me, Pastor Joel.*

My body writhed and bubbled. I wailed. It started in my extremities and made its way to my groin. My testicles expanded and contracted like they were breathing. My penis was swollen, expanding, red and leaking discharge. I wept as I pulled myself across the floor and into the bathroom. I managed to switch the light on, hoping it would scare away the spirits on my tail.

One look at my reflection, and I was no longer Pastor Joel. I was contorting into a mound of flesh. I was bubbling like pizza dough, rounded and pulsating in an oven. The pressure around my midsection was too much to bear. I needed relief. I pulled and tugged. I masturbated. I screamed from the pain, like I was slowly morphing into a festering, infected wound from the inside out.

""God,"" I whimpered. I pulled the hair shears from the drawer and grazed the blade across my flesh. I could no longer see or feel myself. Only the pressure within, like I was about to burst at the seams. I laid the blade across the base of my member and swiftly fingered the shears shut. The sound of the metal scraping against itself sounded like pulling a sword from the stone. I saw my meat fall to the floor with a wet flop, followed by hot liquid cascading down my leg. Shades of red blood and yellow pus gushed from my pubis. I looked down and shrieked and then laughed.

I cried, ""What is happening to me?""

The Devil's disembodied voice echoed in my head now. ""You are Pastor Joel, and you always will be.""

I turned around and slipped in the fluids exploding from my body. My ghosts stayed close by, watchful, and I wished to return to my table to negotiate with The Devil. ""Please,"" I begged. But my pleas were met with silence.

My pores began to leak from my face and my arms. I crawled back towards the kitchen. The Devil had left me alone with my ghosts. A poor sinner, haunted, with no one to pray to anymore.

I pulled up a chair at the kitchen table, wearing an alien body, dickless and dripping with my sins.

My world was dark. My ghosts lingered just beyond the kitchen where I'd had a meal of unearthly delights with the Prince of Darkness. Now, the light on my walls wasn't sunlight—they were dancing red and blue. Sirens.

The police had arrived.

I turned my head back to the kitchen table where my pistol waited patiently for me to accept accountability for the first time in my life. And, for the first time in my life, I understood God’s absence. It is finished.

I recently purchased an RH Lakshmi Wool Rug and an RH Thaddeus Marble Rectangular Coffee Table (about 361 lbs / 164 kg). The table has thin, pointed metal legs, which sit directly on the rug.

At the moment I don’t have any proper protection in place. I temporarily added some soft felt pads I had at home under the legs, just to reduce direct pressure, but I’m not sure if that actually helps.

What’s the best long-term approach here? The goal is to protect both the wool rug and, long-term, the floor underneath.

1pt7whp,https://www.reddit.com/r/GriefSupport/comments/1pt7whp/my_cat_died_last_night/,My cat died last night,"The only topic of conversation in this house was him. Now we'll never have another story of him peeing somewhere weird or sleeping in a silly pose. Hes cold and stiff in the living room. He was 18 and we had him for 8 years. He's always been old but the past couple weeks he's been going down hill. He stopped being able to make it up the stairs. He kept peeing weird places. He got a cold from being let outside by a CERTAIN SOMEONE who thought he would be FINE (HE BARELY KNEW WHERE HE WAS HE WAS SO OLD, AND HE WAS GONE IN THE FREEZING WET SWAMP DOWN A STEEP HILL FOR 6 HOURS!!!). 

I have been having nightmares and OCD intrusive thoughts for weeks. Luckily he died how I wanted him to go. Slowly, comfortably, like falling asleep. Surrounded by people. 

I wasn't there to see him die. I said goodnight, goodbye, I love you and more. I told him he was a good boy. When I walked away he meowed and was staring at me, so I went back and pet him even more. But I haven't been eating or sleeping for DAYS and I was so sick to my stomach I needed to sleep. So I left and went to bed an hour before he passed at 10:30. 

Earlier in the day he was writhing around, couldn't walk so he was just flopping from place to place. We put him in a box with a blanket and a potty pad (he got to the point he couldn't even find somewhere weird to pee, he was just peeing himself). All the fluids and food we got in him were via syringe. He had some water at 7-8pm the evening he passed. He refused food.

He had a vet appointment this morning at 9:30. We had to cancel. It was too late.

We are VERY tight on money. One time he got dehydrated outside and it was like, thousands of dollars for an IV. So everyone didn't want to take him to the vet. I begged and begged and literally started screaming some of my worst intrusive thoughts about him suffering before we all got him an appointment (I couldn't get him one myself). 

He got out in the cold and overdid it on Friday. The earliest appointment was on Monday. He died on Sunday.

I often think, if HE hadn't let him out, would he be dead before Christmas? I knew he was going to die but I wanted him to make it to Christmas. Now we only have memories of him on Christmas. It's going to be a small Christmas anyways, we're dirt broke. But I at least wanted it to be a happy Christmas. Now it won't be. 

There's five people in the house mourning him. Two who were there when he died. Two who haven't cried AT ALL and claim it's because they're ""emotionally stable"" even though I know they loved him as much as we all did. (One of the people who were with him when he died was the one who let him out). 

And then there's me, sobbing as I write this. I have been crying literally non stop since he got out on Friday and all my worst nightmares of him dying alone outside somewhere were realized. He didn't end up dying outside but I think that final adventure sealed his fate. 

I'm trying to eat dry cheerios right now but I can barely stomach the thought of looking at them. I haven't eaten a meal since Saturday. I keep making myself upset thinking about what we could have done, and what happened. I don't want any of the cookies we made. I don't want crackers or plain pasta or fruit. I just want him back.

I genuinely can't stop crying, like, REALLY crying. My stomach feels horrible and I genuinely almost threw up last night before taking cbd. I slept well, now i'm awake and he's gone and I never want to eat again.

I'm terrified of a lot of things, but death always haunts me. I was scared to fall asleep on Saturday because I knew how easy it would be to never wake up. I have a lot of plans in my life I need to finish before I die. 

I'm terrified the people I love will die. One just did. 

Also, the aforementioned people who STILL HAVEN'T CRIED ONCE invited a FRIEND OVER??? WHEN THEY BOTH KNEW HE WAS DYING???

The friend was super nice but imagine you get invited over to play deltarune with your buddies and I'm in the background huddled over the dying cat just WAILING. Like the most horrible sobs non-stop, saying just miserable things about how much I'm going to miss him and how much I love him. 

And every time I have to go do something I keep asking them to please watch the cat to make sure he's still breathing and not writhing around, AND THEY DON'T. SO THE FRIEND HAS TO WATCH **OUR** CAT AND CONSOLE **ME** BECAUSE THOSE ASSHOLES ARE FIGHTING DELTARUNE BOSSES!! He literally said this is the most uncomfortable thing he's ever done multiple time and those two assholes didn't even say ANYTHING. 

So yeah, they decided to invite a friend over and play deltarune while he died instead of comforting and watching him. They only went over to pet him a couple times and didn't even say anything. Even though we have ALL had him the same amount of time. 

And this morning, one is playing deltarune AGAIN (LIKE 3 FEET AWAY FROM THE DEAD CAT ON THE COFFEE TABLE, NO EXPRESSION ON HIS FACE) and the other is eating THREE CHICKEN SANDWICHES AND AN ACTUAL POUND OF LEFTOVER MAC N CHEESE. NOT EVEN CRYING WHILE THE CAT IS DEAD IN THE OTHER ROOM. HE DIDN'T EVEN GO LOOK. HE WOKE UP, HAD THE NASTIEST CHICKEN CHEESE BREAKFAST AND LEFT TO GO UPSTAIRS AND PLAY GAMES. 

Meanwhile I feel like I'm going to have every stomach related problem possible and still feel sick from the SINGULAR cheerio I had five minutes ago. 

So yeah, I was just sobbing non stop and petting him, one was syringe feeding him and crying, one LET HIM OUTSIDE ON FRIDAY (but is admittedly very upset and crying a lot too), and the other two still haven't cried. 

My therapist hasn't reached out to reschedule our appointment but I think I need it. Life felt less real eight years ago before we got him. Now I think it's fading out of reality again. 

I am an extremely sensitive and emotional person inherently, and I'm off my antidepressants and antipsychotics because of a test I had to do at the hospital that required no medicine for a month beforehand. (Still recovering, it was a very long and painful test). 

I already HATE taking my medicine because some of my major OCD ruminating thoughts are about medicine being poisonous/dangerous/going to give me serotonin syndrome or alzheimers. Now the cat dies and I have zero coping mechanisms, completely unmedicated and taking shitloads of cbd non stop to cope with the chronic pain flair ups the stress and grief is causing me. I guess that's a medication but it's not like, a prescribed one. 

I don't know. My therapist told me to write out my thoughts to get them out of my head. Every time I think about him i either start crying or sobbing.

I just saw what my friends texted me while I'm writing this and it's making me more upset. My head wont stop pounding from the crying. I keep making myself more and more and more upset thinking about it. I think I'm making the people around me upset too. 

I miss him so much and he's not even in the ground yet. He's just cold. I genuinely can't stop sobbing as I write this.

I don't feel like doing anything, watching anything, painting or drawing or researching or playing a game. I just want to keep petting him. His ears are cold and stiff. His tail wont move. He still has some drool dried in his fur. I miss him so much. I know I'm going to be crying like this well after Christmas. Were going to bury him in the back yard. I know I'll never see him again at that point. 

I don't want to bury him where they want to bury him. I want to bury him by the shed or the garden. They want to bury him by the back hill (WHERE HE GOT LOST AND INJURED ON FRIDAY!!! HE WOULD NOT WANT TO BE BURIED THERE!!!). 

I'm just so upset. It still doesn't feel real. At all. I feel like I'm in a nightmare. I've been having so many nightmares about him for weeks. 

I'm so upset I feel like I'm making everything about me. I need help to eat and I still haven't asked anybody. They usually have to help me make food but... I don't know.

1pt7v9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1pt7v9z/managing_bpmpoor_circulation_on_vyvanse/,Managing BPM/Poor Circulation on Vyvanse?,"So I’ve been on 30mg Vyvanse for about 6 months now. It’s awesome! I feel a lot more clear-headed and my ADHD-related anxiety has been significantly reduced. I’m also chronically borderline hypotensive—running usually just above the line where I would fall into that range. Vyvanse gives my BP the boot up to where I don’t feel constantly dizzy/tired/nauseous.

I had the usual side effects the first few weeks: reduced appetite, dry mouth, and maybe a tiny bit jittery with my daily coffee. But those have gradually abated as I’ve taken it consistently. But something that hasn’t gone away and is beginning to worry me is an elevated BPM.

When the meds first kick in, I will feel a bump up to 90-120. Depends on the day, it seems. Food doesn’t seem to make a significant difference. It’ll kinda hover in those higher numbers for a bit and then go down to just being slightly elevated for what I’m doing and be fine for the rest of the day.

But as the meds are falling off, I feel like I’ll get a MAJOR bump in my bpm for a few hours at a time. For example, I was walking around the store the other day and I was bending over repeatedly to look at something and I could REALLY feel my ticker thumping pretty fast. I started keeping an O2 reader on me (health OCD reassurance indulgence) and it was hitting 140!

140 is about the highest I see it get. Usually when I’m moving around a lot or feeling excited/anxious. I know that’s not inherently an unsafe number but I worry about the long term damage to my heart.

Otherwise, my Vyvanse resting bpm sits in the 90s and standing will see the 100-125 range.

And like I said, my BP runs on the low side normally so I’ve dealt with poor circulation my entire life. It doesn’t bother me too much. My hands and feet just get really cold really easily. But Vyvanse seems to kind of intensify it.

I’m 25f. I had a full cardiovascular work-up about 3 years ago to test for POTS that came back clean. I try to hydrate well and get plenty of sleep. I am a healthy weight. If anything, I could use to gain a little. My only real naughty points go to my caffeine addiction and I could use to be a bit more active. I’ve cut back on my caffeine a bit in the past week or so to try and curb my heart rate but it only seems to be helping a little.

I’m seeing my doctor for a follow-up on everything in January, but I guess I kinda just wanted some reassurance or tips on managing my cardio health until then. Getting on Vyvanse was a really big and scary move for me after years of managing ADHD with just a criminal amount of caffeine. I just don’t want to die because I tried to get better mental health care.

I’m looking for advice on protecting a rug from a heavy coffee table.

I recently purchased an RH Lakshmi Wool Rug and an RH Thaddeus Marble Rectangular Coffee Table (about 361 lbs / 164 kg). The table has thin, pointed metal legs (see photos), which sit directly on the rug.

At the moment I don’t have any proper protection in place. I temporarily added some soft felt pads I had at home under the legs, just to reduce direct pressure, but I’m not sure if that actually helps.

What’s the best long-term approach here? The goal is to protect both the wool rug and, long-term, the floor underneath.

Any real-world experience with heavy stone tables on rugs would be very appreciated.

I'm adding three drops in the food prep area for ticket printer and future/spare devices.  

The area may be considered ""back of house"", but there are no stoves, ovens, or burners, the area is primarily for preparing sandwiches.  

Queried AI and the recommendation is to use EMT (metal conduit).  Even re-phrased the question inquiring about using cable tray/hider typically used to hide network and other cabling.  The consensus is NOT to use any wire loom or ENT as it's not rated for kitchen use, (fire/heat/grease) etc.  

It would be ideal to run EMT, however I'm curious if others have ran cables in stick-on cable hider channels, or ENT wire loom.  Just trying to protect the Cat6 cable up a wall and over a doorway to run the cable to the other side of the door.  There is no viable route to come up from the bottom (basement) as the basement/storage area has a finished ceiling, and other restrictions.  

Would appreciate any feedback or suggestions.  For now, though the cabling will be ran in a temporary cable hider. ",2,1766429976.0,lowvoltage,3,0.75,False

I thought it was sleep or coffee timing. It could possibly be lactate in addition to other reasons.

Hard effort or stress spikes lactate → clearance lags → acid load rises → brain fog and heavy legs → daytime crash.

Do this for 10 days:

• Zone 2, 30 to 40 minutes most days. Easy pace. You should talk in full sentences.  
• Walk 10 to 15 minutes after lunch.  
• Eat protein plus carbs at breakfast and after workouts. Not just coffee.  
• Beta alanine 3.2 to 6.4 g per day for 4 to 8 weeks. It raises muscle carnosine and buffers the acid that rides with lactate. Expect tingles.  
• Sodium bicarbonate 0.2 to 0.3 g per kg 60 to 90 minutes pre hardest sessions. Extra buffering. Test tolerance. GI can bite.  
• A sports focused probiotic that uses lactate and makes propionate. Idea is simple. Less lactate pooling in the gut. More SCFAs that support barrier and energy signaling. Human data is early, so give it 3 to 4 weeks and look for steadier afternoons, not jitters.  
• Add electrolytes, not only water. A pinch of potassium salt in food helps if your kidneys are healthy.  
• Cut one HIIT day. Build base first.

If you are still cooked, rule out the big rocks. Ferritin and iron, B12, thyroid, sleep apnea.

This was not instant for me. Day 11 to 14 is where it started to click. Less fog. Fewer crashes. More even energy.",1,1766429749.0,Biohackers,1,0.6,False

Christmas and New Year are just around the corner.

Maybe this season is meant for new connections and new beginnings.

With Christmas lights glowing and New Year dreams waiting, this is the perfect time to find someone special. 

Skip fake profiles and endless swipes, choose verified dating platforms where real people connect through video chats first. 

Start a genuine conversation, feel the spark, and step into the new year with a meaningful connection. 

Along with using online platforms, you can explore real-life and social ways too. 

Attend Christmas or New Year parties, social mixers, concerts, or community events where people are already in a relaxed, romantic mood.

Join interest-based groups like fitness classes, dance, hobby clubs etc. 

Cafés, bookstores, festive markets, and co working spaces are also great places to meet like-minded singles. 

Whether online or offline, be open, genuine, and social the right connection often comes when you’re simply enjoying the moment ",1,1766429678.0,u_Weird-Pressure-4963,0,1.0,False

came across this app called Oobit and its been pretty game changing for me (Africa based). basically you can pay with your crypto (BTC, ETH, USDT, bunch of others) anywhere that takes Visa or Mastercard. like literally just tap your phone like its Apple Pay but its pulling from your crypto wallet

the cool part is you dont need to transfer to some exchange first or get a special card mailed to you or anything. just connect your existing wallet and boom youre good to go. ive been using it for coffee, groceries, gas, even paid my phone bill with it

for anyone whos trying to live off crypto or getting close to FIRE this seems like exactly what we needed. instead of cashing out big chunks and losing that upside potential you can just spend what you need when you need it. keeps more of your stack working for you

I imagine it as an unassuming ally, silently smoothing out the chaotic waves of anxiety and depression that once relentlessly pounded against the shores of my mind. It's a curious concept, isn't it? 

One afternoon, while sitting in my backyard, a bee was hovering around a nearby daisy. It occurred to me, in that moment, that this bee had no idea about my struggles, or about the chemical assistant I ingested daily to keep my mental equilibrium balanced. And here I was – watching a bee visiting a flower, sipping my coffee and just... exist without being mired in negativity or dread - an every day scenario for some, but a victory for people like me. 

Do you think there's a certain beauty in that simplicity? 

Without going into the myriad debates on antidepressants, can we just pause and appreciate the fact that, for many of us, a tiny pill allows life not to be a harsh battleground but rather a place where bees visit daisies, coffee smells robust, and a patch of sun feels like a warm, gentle hug?

It's now been about 4 months since I tested negative. I've also had an endoscopy done after testing negative which didn't find anything concerning. However I continue to experience bloating after consuming specific foods (fried and/or spicy in particular), coffee, dairy or alcohol. 

I have two questions :

1. Can anyone who's recovered completely share their experience? How long did it take? What can I do to get there besides avoiding triggers?

2. Right now, when my bloating gets really bad my doctor recommended I take Omeprazole - is that common? Are there any side effects I should be aware of?",1,1766429463.0,HPylori,1,0.99,False

Save Me 🙏","Started Keto November 27th of 2025 and the issue is I'm feeling extremely fatigued (before you say electrolytes, continue reading) and sometimes tired, some brain fog but moments of mental clarity where my words flow like a magnificent waterfall. The pro I'm experiencing is less inflammation and I feel I have a bit more morning energy and feel lighter, but crash mid day and get weak. I'm male, 27, 6'5, 135lbs to date, before starting I was around 150lbs. According to BMI I am underweight which may be the issue. But please continue reading. I am super active, Pre-Keto I use to do cardio for 2 hours everyday, and on the weekend up to 4 hours on the elliptical. On Keto, I actually got more energy to do it even longer without even breaking a sweat, but now the fatigue is setting in. 

 I keep up on my Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium, and Calcium (as keto can make you excrete water, before keto I was like 150lbs). I take collagen, multi vitamin, bone broth, you get the point. I eat healthy, and even before switching to keto, I was naturally low carb (maybe around 120g) and never drank soda or ate processed food. But my choices of food wasn't diversed. I keep net carbs at 20 or below, sometimes I creep up to 25. But I do HVAC, and have an active job. I am under some stress but have been working in that and this past week skipped the gym and cutting back on excessively working out and implementing more weights but not over doing it. 

I'm not sure if I have high cortisol or perhaps insulin resistance. But I have always preferred waking up early. My sleep is not the best, 5-7 hours according to my Garmin tracker. 

Up until going full keto, I jumped into fasting rather quickly than I should have. I'm talking 2-3 days. I'm not trying to loose weight but was doing it for clarity and health. My macro goals I set up on cronometer is 120g of protein, 140g of fat, and 20 net carbs. I set the calorie intake at 1800 but I don't refer to that. I just don't get hungry, but lately I have been needed to snack on a couple times throughout the day to restore energy. Usually on cheese or something fatty. Sometimes nuts. Recently got into Keto Chow to try and get more calories in. 

My glutes have also flattened out (think keto took them from me) or that's why I'm thinking my cortisol may be high since it's a sign, even though I have no belly whatsoever. As for insulin resistance I don't have skin tags or a dark spots and I don't crave carbs. I don't have any lab work, or know my blood glucose or ketones. 

- I stopped fasting, I normally don't eat breakfast but have coffee, heavy cream, and MCT oil on the morning. Where would you recommend me to start to address my fatigue? Am I still transitioning to burning ketones effectively? Or is there something else I should look at? I normally eat or get up close to protein goal, maybe 70-100g, and usually my fat is around that or a little less.

1pt7igm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1pt7igm/global_quick_capture/,Global quick capture,"I've seen a few questions and suggestions about quickly capturing notes and ideas into Obsidian globally, but haven't seen mention of [The Archive](https://zettelkasten.de/the-archive/).

I'm not affiliated with the dev. I bought a license years ago and later, when Obsidian came along, figured out I can use The Archive to quickly capture ideas without having to open Obsidian or click into it.

The Archive is a basic Zettelkasten app (not so different from nvAlt if memory serves). It includes a *global* quick-capture window you can bring up with a hotkey (a lot like Drafts), hammer out an idea or a few thoughts, press return and... done.

Here's how I make it work with Obsidian:

1. Create a folder in your Obsidian vault called ""Inbox"" (or whatever) — or choose an existing vault folder where you want your quick-capture notes to land.
2. In The Archive's preferences, under the ""Storage"" tab, set your chosen Obsidian folder as the ""Archive Directory.""
3. Under the ""Advanced"" tab, set a ""Quick Entry Shortcut"" (hotkey).
4. Also under the ""Advanced"" tab, make sure ""Plain Text File Extensions"" is set to ""md"" (markdown.)

Now you've got a frictionless way to capture notes into Obsidian on the fly. The quick-capture window will automatically give your note a numbered Zettlekasten title. You can press tab to change it to any title you like (or just leave it and change it later in Obsidian.)

The catch is that The Archive costs $20. (I think I just heard everyone on this sub spitting out their coffee.) That's obviously a lot just to create a quick-capture system. I ain't trying to sell you on this thing. No, I'm passing this along because people have been asking about this sort of thing, and I've found this solution works seamlessly, there's no learning curve and it takes seconds to set up. For what it's worth, The Archive is a decent plain-text notes app in its own right.

Other options include creating a Shortcut if you're in the Apple ecosystem. There are Raycast and Alfred extensions as well. All three of those are going to involve a bit more of a learning curve and (possibly) take a bit more time to set up. In addition, I know a lot of folks don't mind clicking into Obsidian and using the ""QuickAdd"" plugin.

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

We phone called before a few times and there seemed to be a decent vibe between us, the conversation was flowing alright. But I didn’t feel like there was not much depth to his answers. I asked what qualities he values in a person he just said ‘someone who can take a joke.’ 

I suggested bowling and he said he wanted to save his money so I suggested coffee and walk he agreed. 

On the morning of the date I messaged asking if we can meet another day as I was feeling tired (insomnia) and he got pretty annoyed he said ‘in all respect it’s just a coffee date.’ He phoned me then was like ‘are you bailing on me?’ I explained I’m not. I wasn’t sure if this was a red flag or just his personality since he was pretty sarcastic on previous phone calls. 

Anyways we ended up meeting at the park. 
When I met him he said something about having to take a phone call from a friend however I must have misheard. 


We got a coffee then just walked around the park, it was very cold. He said ‘where do you want to go?’ I wasn’t sure so I just suggested going on the high street. We then walked in a shop. About less than 10 minutes later he said his friend needs him at the flat to sign a document and he has to go. 

On the date he never asked questions to get to know me and said that money is everything in life and can buy you happiness. I disagreed said it doesn’t. He seemed very self absorbed with his corporate job. He said he would never leave the city as I mentioned living in the countryside. 

So all together the date was less than one hour.

It's very hard to relate to anyone. And I can't help but think that all this spiritual work has created a massive gap between this soul and society. I haven't been one for talking huge amounts, but now, I feel like half the stuff that was once said isn't worth mentioning. So I find that the body that is possessed would rather sit alone in a coffee shop, and that's quite sad.

I've become this very lonely 'being' around my city. Even the work place feels at arms length.

I understand the concept of spiritual-works as far as this mind has allowed me, so far. Yet I find myself pondering why all this inner healing and demon facing when I have no doubts that all this self reflection will take me back to where I originally started. Because the irony of spiritually is, once the books have been placed down, everything you ever wanted is right in front of you, just with more understanding.

I don't even know what life is supposed to mean anymore. I still have to work in a minimum wage job, which can be depleting. The television became a box of moving daggers attached to very loud sirens and social media has my brother going round in circles. And what's even stranger is everyone looks a little sick inside, fueled by their ego. A sea of unwell people!

It's not that I am empty, but rather I find one has very little direction. I don't even believe half the crap in this head which is concerning, as there seems to be little faith that something worth doing, for the enjoyment, could be another trap.

It's like battling with two minds. Having to constantly look at my thoughts. Living in a dream, playing characters. Surely this is a recipe for madness? My motivation has also gone, because now I wonder, is there any point to anything other than sitting in stillness.

The only comfort I am able to attain is in the breath, thankfully.

It's gotten to a point where I have considered stopping, although I do not think that is possible, which gives the feeling of being completely isolated. Miles and miles away from humanity. And there isn't anyone within the same proximity that could really relate. I am almost at the point where I have considered giving up completely. Is that the answer? Presence among-st the masses and nothing more?

What am I even doing this all for, if everyone else is still asleep?

Perhaps the books have become too much.

I decided to go see a psychotherapist about other topic to help shed different corners of weight, but it became apparent, very quickly, she wasn't as spiritual as what was mentioned. And it was obvious she was a little worried with some of my language. So again, I find myself wondering why all this torture, when you could live in ignorance and still essential find yourself beyond the human vessel.

You've got 80% of people on here saying that they wouldn't date anyone other than those who have also taken the path and I agree to some extent. Unfortunately, this make it feel like making any sort of connection is not as worthwhile, even though people will always be people, regardless. But I don't want to be like that. Surely anyone I find of interest is worth investing in? Spiritual or not. Maybe I could finally fall in love.

Obviously being part of the collective is where it is at, but how does one integrate again when with a slightly newer understanding of mind and body? I feel like I have hung myself taking this path. Some days it feels like I am about to go insane.

Is there really bliss to be found? Or is that another egoic construct?

Please tell me this is all worth it! Because I really do not care to much about studying books or meditation as much as I did a few years aback. I wanna have fun again.",2,1766429173.0,awakened,10,1.0,False

(Long but necessary read)","Hey Reddit, I need to vent about my friend, ""Dave"" (his GF is Jana, I’m Jacob). We’ve been friends for 11 years, and the last 3 years in university were **amazing**—we got really close and were inseparable, which makes the last few weeks of his behavior so much worse. i also happen to own a local clothing brand  as partners with dave..(which makes it so much harder to just let him go)

# The Dave System

I admit I coast in uni; I think the classes are useless, so I do the minimum. Dave, on the other hand, is a brown-noser. He treats TAs and professors like gods—buying them coffee and getting insider info no one else had. This meant Dave was always the team leader, and his connections guaranteed us full marks. The routine was: he gets the info, he and Jana do the main work, and he gives the rest of us tiny bits.

He was a nightmare to work with for others. He’d constantly abuse any random teammates who showed initiative, calling them slurs and sabotaging them by sending the work at 4 AM, then lying to the TA that they ""wouldn't move a muscle."" I regret always agreeing with him just to shut him up. This pattern happened on something like **31 out of 36 projects.** Dave is seriously manipulative and has a huge narcissistic streak.

# The Cliffhanger Betrayal

A month ago, the toxicity hit me personally. Uni said we could discuss projects early for bonus points, but there was no official date. Dave gave vague warnings about discussing Subject 1 and 2 on three straight days (Sun, Mon, Tue). Since he hadn't done any work and it wasn't official, I figured it was nonsense and went to bed at 10 PM Tuesday.

At 11 PM, Dave finished the project and sent it **only to my DMs**. I woke up at 9 AM Wednesday to a frantic call from our other friend, Sara: ""Where are you? We are about to discuss the project!"" I rushed to campus, realizing they were indeed discussing TWO projects. Without mentioning anything over the group chats we had for each project...

When I confronted them: Dave played dumb: ""I told you yesterday!"" I reminded him he said ""might,"" and that we hadn't done the work. Then the gaslighting started. He accused me of not checking the file, and Jana chimed in with, ""Yeah, we stayed up until 5 AM fixing that project, and all you did was sleep."" I was so shocked and humiliated that I just stood there.

# Escalation and Public Slander

After I got through that discussion, I decided to overcompensate to prove I wasn't a burden. But the abuse continued. Dave pulled the same trick on a random girl for Subject 2, insulting her and using slurs. When I tried to intervene, **Jana and Sara backed Dave up**, saying he was ""in the right.""

He then started making passive-aggressive ""jokes"" about me sleeping all day. Worse, he told the TA that the girl was a ""bitch"" who did nothing, and the TA just laughed because he thinks Dave is a hard worker.

# The Final Humiliation

For Subject 3, I worked **tirelessly**—over 10 hours a day for three days, even missing my brother's birthday. I sent the perfect project to Dave, telling him specifically to test it because it failed on Sara's PC. He replied, ""**It works perfectly bro its amazing**.""

The next morning, I saw he sent a ""FINAL version"" at 5 AM. At uni, Jana immediately screamed at me, saying they stayed up until 5 AM fixing my ""half-assed"" project that was ""missing requirements."" I knew I worked my butt off,  my project was flawless i know it works on my pc 100% without a doubt but i didn't bring it !,but they kept humiliating me.

In the discussion, their version of the  project failed to run (I assume Dave messed it up at 5 AM). He covered it by showing a video to the TA. Then, when I thanked the professor, Dave looked right at me and said, **""You worked really hard snoring in bed ya?""**—a sarcastic jab, **in front of the professor**. It was a deliberate, public attack to steal credit.

I went home immediately, recorded a video proving the project worked flawlessly, and sent it to the group. His response? ""**ok go watch it alone then**."" When I told him his comment hurt, he called me a ""**cry baby, it's just a joke**"" and then said my previous warning about the project not running ""wasn't clear""—the exact confusion he constantly exploits in others.

# The Isolation

That was yesterday. Dave went silent. Today, the abuse continued. After we got a bad grade on a different project (the TA didn't know Dave, thankfully), I said I studied hard. Jana immediately jumped in: ""You always study but you never work! you study and sleep and you get grades.""

For tomorrow's final project, I offered to carry the work and went home to start. I sent them the file. They said they'd work. **Six hours later, zero response from Dave or Sara.** I called. No answer.

I realized with certainty that they are now doing to me—the friend he had for 11 years—the same exact thing they do to the ""randoms,"" isolating me, cutting me out, and setting me up to fail right before the discussion. Dave is a narcissistic control freak, and his friendship means absolutely nothing if I don't give him all the credit and silent approval.

1pt7ekf,https://www.reddit.com/r/lostafriend/comments/1pt7ekf/manipulative_best_friend/,"Manipulative ""Best friend""","Hey Reddit, I need to vent about my friend, ""Dave"" (his GF is Jana, I’m Jacob). We’ve been friends for 11 years, and the last 3 years in university were amazing—we got really close and were inseparable, which makes the last few weeks of his behavior so much worse.

# The Dave System

I admit Im lazy about uni; I think the classes are useless, so I do the minimum. Dave, on the other hand, is a brown-noser. He treats TAs and professors like gods—buying them coffee and getting insider info no one else had. This meant Dave was always the team leader, and his connections guaranteed us full marks. The routine was: he gets the info, he and Jana do the main work, and he gives the rest of us tiny bits.

He was a nightmare to work with for others. He’d constantly abuse any random teammates who showed initiative, calling them slurs and sabotaging them by sending the work at 4 AM, then lying to the TA that they ""wouldn't move a muscle."" I regret always agreeing with him just to shut him up. This pattern happened on something like 31 out of 36 projects. Dave is seriously manipulative and has a huge narcissistic streak.

# The Cliffhanger Betrayal

A month ago, the toxicity hit me personally. Uni said we could discuss projects early for bonus points, but there was no official date. Dave gave vague warnings about discussing Subject 1 and 2 on three straight days (Sun, Mon, Tue). Since he hadn't done any work and it wasn't official, I figured it was nonsense and went to bed at 10 PM Tuesday.

At 11 PM, Dave finished the project and sent it only to my DMs. I woke up at 9 AM Wednesday to a frantic call from our other friend, Sara: ""Where are you? We are about to discuss the project!"" I rushed to campus, realizing they were indeed discussing TWO projects.

1pt7ei3,https://i.redd.it/ayusjq6ews8g1.jpeg,"Small Designer & Lifestyle Haul – Thom Browne, Margiela, Loro Piana, Patagonia, UGG","1. Thom Browne Zip Hoodie (Grey)
Clean design and the signature sleeve stripes look great. Fabric feels decent, but it’s more of a lightweight hoodie than something for cold weather. Fit is a bit slim, which might not be for everyone.
Score: 8/10

2. Loro Piana Denim (Washed Blue)
Nice vintage-style wash and the denim feels comfortable right out of the gate. That said, the cut is pretty straightforward and doesn’t stand out much compared to other premium jeans.
Score: 7.5/10

3. Patagonia Fleece Vest (Black)
Very practical piece. Warm, lightweight, and easy to layer. Not really a fashion statement, but it does exactly what it’s supposed to do. Great for daily wear.
Score: 8/10

4. UGG Suede Boots (Beige)
Surprisingly comfortable with a solid sole. The suede looks good, but it might be a bit high-maintenance and prone to marks if you’re not careful. Still a cozy option.
Score: 8/10

5. Maison Margiela Knit Sweater (Olive) – Favorite
This is the standout for me. The knit texture, subtle details, and overall fit feel very refined. It looks simple at first glance but has that quiet, high-end vibe. Easily the most “special” piece in the haul.
Score: 9.5/10 ⭐

6. Fashion & Design Books Set
Nice decorative pieces for a shelf or coffee table. They add aesthetic value, though they’re more about visuals than deep reading.
Score: 7/10

7. Black Zip Knit Jacket
Simple and wearable, but slightly plain. The knit is fine, though it doesn’t have many details that make it memorable.
Score: 7/10

8. Thom Browne Crewneck Knit (Navy)
Classic Thom Browne look with the arm stripes. Quality is there, but the fit is very slim and might feel restrictive for some people.
Score: 8/10

9. Cream Half-Zip Knit Sweater
Clean color and nice texture. Good for layering, but the lighter color may show wear more easily over time.

But what if your idea isn't ready to be talked about yet? What if it's half-baked and you know it?

  
You're not avoiding customers because you're scared of rejection. You're avoiding them because showing something unfinished to real people locks you into defending it before you've figured it out.

  
The best validation happens before the conversation. When you can test assumptions without stakes. When you can fail 20 times in private before you succeed once in public. That's when ideas actually get better.

I’m a dogtor 🐕🐈 working 10–14 hour shifts, and frankly, my social battery isn't just low—it’s been in ""Power Saving Mode"" since med school. I’m looking for a friend who understands that sometimes, the best ""hangout"" is just sitting in the same room in comfortable silence, or rotting on the couch while we scroll through our phones.

I might reply in 5 minutes, or I might reply in 3 business days because I fell asleep mid-type. I need someone who won't take it personally.

- 5'6, 70kg, average built (if this matters)
- Professional by day, a literal vegetable by night.
- I have great stories from the hospital, but I usually only have the energy to tell them in bullet points.
- Very low maintenance. I don’t need constant updates, just a solid connection.
- If we vibed malay mo mailabas mo yung kulit ko hahaha

About You:
- Same age or older. Yung tapos na sa party phase.
- You have your own life/career and understand that ""free time"" is a luxury, not a given.
- You’re perfectly happy with a ""friendship"" that consists of 70% memes and 30% low-effort coffee dates or Netflix marathons.
- Please be around qc or near cities for sponty gala na hindi plinano

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

im 16M have autism and i think it is citalopram im taking? and i go to a place where u go to and eventually go back to school im there monday and friday morning (9-12) and wednsday the whole day (9-3)

and its fine

but the last few days i have been feeling horrid like excuse me for the words ima be using

but i kinda feel really fucked up idk how to properly translate it to english i dont think there is a way but how i would say like a cancer really fucking bad i dont want to do anything nor do i want to sleep

and idk why this is happening like my life isnt interesting at all if there would be a button that would make me die and everybody forgot my it would be a 60/40% that id push it with the 60% being pushing it

and i dont do anything all day i just... game thats it nothing more 0 friends irl online i have a few

and to the location i go i met someone we had a nice click and we met up one time we were at my place from 1pm till 12pm but a few days later i made a joke (not even gonna repeat it im so ashamed of it and ik it was really stupid) and he didnt like it which is completly my fault i just have the tendency to find the limits with people so i know what i can do its a bad habbit

well didnt like it etc etc eventually he reached out to me saying via a councelor so to speak before u see each other again (didnt happen yet due to me leaving 2 hours early now him also not always being there this was 3 weeks ago) that he did really like the contact we had there but that contact outside of the place is a bit much rn

which i understand fully and i said if the councler could say to him that i understand and if he ever wants to do something after he left there since hes almost 18 i think in a week and once ur 18 u need to leave there he can just send a message

and im fine with that bit of a bumer but im fine with that problem is idk if it actually was that reason or because of the joke but i cant do anything else than take his word

but idk that idea has been floating around in my head sometimes but hey people come and go and im only 16

it is what it is

but thats only a small part of why i feel ass and usualy i dont really think about it but idk what it is or why it is i just feel FUCKED

and idk what to do with this any tips

i dont wanna game i dont wanna read i dont wanna sleep i dont wanna watch a serie or movie

and my mom will be councling the dr about it but thats tommorow since he aint working rn but i swear to god if he suggest changing meds im gonna lose it these are the 3rd also had zoloft/sertralin and aripiprazol im on meds for 4 ish years rn and the going down in slowly dossage to start the other one is hell everytime i just hope i dont need to.. again

You spend months coding in your cave. You drink too much coffee. You neglect your friends. Finally, you launch on Product Hunt. You spam your Twitter, beg for upvotes, and get a nice little spike of traffic.

And then? **Silence.**

A week later, your product is buried under 50 new AI wrappers, and you’re back to square one.

The problem isn't your product. The problem is that current platforms are designed for *marketers*, not builders. They are full of other developers trying to sell to developers. It’s an echo chamber where everyone is shouting, ""Look at me!"" and nobody is actually listening (or buying).

We realized that building an audience is actually harder than building the product itself. And that’s backward.

**So, we decided to fix it.**

We are building **LaunchBackers**. It’s not just another directory where you post once and die. We completely rethought the mechanism of how products grow.

Instead of a one-time splash, we built a space for **continuous storytelling**.

* **Built-in Blogging:** Every product gets a dedicated blog space.
* **True Subscriptions:** Users don't just ""upvote"" they subscribe to your journey. When you push an update or a V2, they actually know about it.
* **Crowdfunding & Backing:** This is the game-changer. We integrated funding directly into the lifecycle. You can raise support for a specific feature, a V2, or just initial traction.

But the biggest issue we wanted to solve? **The Echo Chamber.** We are building a mechanism specifically designed to attract *actual users -* ordinary people, not just other SaaS founders. We’re introducing a system (which I can’t fully spoil yet, but it involves unique incentives for non-creators) that turns passive scrollers into active **Backers**.

We want to make ""building in public"" actually profitable, not just a vanity metric.

If you’re tired of the ""Launch and Ghost"" cycle, I’d love for you to check out what we’re cooking. We’re dropping the full details on the ""Backer"" innovation to our newsletter subscribers first.

1pt75gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/hostaway_official/comments/1pt75gs/the_book_forgotten_in_the_library/,The book forgotten in the library,"I'm a librarian at the Querétaro Public Library, and my favorite job is going through returned books: sometimes they find notes, newspaper clippings, or even coins inside. Four months ago, I found something that changed everything.

A young man returned ""One Hundred Years of Solitude"" (the most stolen book in the library, by the way)—and inside was a 20-peso bill and a note written in the margin of page 127 (the one where Úrsula realizes the house is being overrun by bees):

""If anyone reads this: this book kept me company during the worst week of my life (I lost my job, and my dog ​​got sick). If you found it, use the 20 pesos to buy a coffee—you deserve it. I'm Dani, by the way. If you want to return the favor, leave a book that has helped you at some point on shelf 7, in the 'Latin American Fiction' section.""

I used the $20 to buy a coffee (as she suggested), and I placed Marcela Serrano's ""The House on the Beach"" on the shelf she mentioned: it's the book that helped me when my grandmother died. I wrote a note in the margin of page 89:

""Thanks for the coffee. This book taught me to see the light on gray days. I'm Valeria.""

Three weeks passed, and I found the book again at the returns desk: it was ""The House on the Beach,"" and Dani had written a note on the page after mine:

""I read it in two days. It made me cry on the page where the grandmother leaves the cookies for the little girl. Do you want to go for coffee (my way, this time) to talk about books? I'm at the library café every Thursday at 6 p.m.""

I went. Dani was a young man with brown hair, a scar on his forehead (he fell off his bike as a child, he told me), and a small dog named Mango (who was already healthy) that he carried in a backpack. We talked until the library closed: he told me he'd gotten a new job at a bookstore, and I told him my dream was to start a reading club for children in public schools.

Since then:

- Every Thursday, we meet in the library café: we drink coffee, talk about books, and Mango falls asleep at the table.

- He leaves books for me on shelf 7, with notes on the pages that remind me of things we talked about (once, he left ""The Little Prince"" with a note on the rose page: ""I'm reminded of her, because you're the only one who makes me want to read children's books again"").

- I leave him oatmeal cookies (the ones my grandmother taught me to make) at his bookstore, with a note that says, ""For when you're having a bad day.""

Last week, he asked me to stop leaving books for him on shelf 7. I was scared—until he said,

""Because I want you to take a book you don't have to return. It's a brand-new copy of 'One Hundred Years of Solitude,' with a note on page 127: 'I want to share all my gray days and all my good days with you.'""

Now, the book is on my nightstand, and Mango has his own armchair in my apartment. We still find notes in the books returned by users—but none have been as important as the first.

Made my first cortado on the flair, latte art at home after quite some time!
I’ve always had this habit of going deep into hobbies, especially ones where trial and error never really ends.
Coffee stuck because it’s not just about taste. I’m equally obsessed with the design of the tools! how drippers are shaped, how materials behave, how each piece works on its own yet comes together as a system.
Even though I haven’t grown coffee myself, learning about everything... from how it’s grown to how it’s brewed is endlessly fascinating!
This setup grew naturally from that mindset. Always tweaking, rearranging, learning letting function dictate form.
It’s definitely reached a point where choosing what to brew with each day is the hardest decision.
Lately it’s started to feel less like a home counter and more like a tiny café.
Sometimes I wonder if it could evolve into a closed, invite-only café + studio + coffee experience lab.
No roadmap. Just letting the curiosity lead.

Can't wait to try that greysoul strawberry in loop in espresso lol, added an espresso setup after the beans rested! Seems like everything came along just for that 😂😅",39,1766428372.0,IndiaCoffee,26,0.92,False

Peter woke up and stretched. He immediately realized the bed was empty and looked around. A cup of coffee sat next to the bed, growing cold.  He chuckled and stood up. She had been both excited and upset with him about the chosen spot.  But she had liked the sight of the city from the drones. It was clear which species was the dominant.

The Fushan had managed to build a vast empire here. They thought they saw a few other aliens among them.  They had watched them for a while, and then he had been “arrested” for the night. She had probably wanted to get an early start, and they would be far away from the city by now. He was impressed by how smooth she flew; he couldn't even feel them moving. He pressed the intercom to tell her he was awake.

“Morning sunshine, when did you get up?” There was no reply, and he looked at the screen, the container hadn’t moved. He immediately reached into the shelf and grabbed a pistol. He checked it and moved towards the door. Had she hacked the computer? Was she playing a prank? Would he peek outside and see her pilot the bikes? He didn’t even want to think about the option. He looked outside and saw the bikes parked, locked securely in the container.  He opened the door, and the smell immediately hit him, so he closed the door. The door closed, and he sank down as the world turned black.

When he woke up, he had a terrible headache, and he felt like shit. He immediately went to the computer and tried to locate Kiko; he quickly found her. She was in the city.

“Ship! How long since Kiko left the habitat?”

“She left the habitat 48 hours ago!” The computer replied with it’s cold, detached voice.

“Shit, how long since I closed the habitat door and fell asleep?” He felt panic rising.

“You have been asleep for 21 hours and 34 minutes!”

“Okay, okay, can you read her bio signal from here? How is her condition?”  He got up and started to get dressed quickly. He needed to rescue her.

“Her signals are slightly elevated, but there is no physical damage report. She is lacking more iron in her diet.” It replied.

“Have the habitat been attacked after we landed?”

“No, the only change was the fires that appeared in the cave system below, which produced a gas that spread over the area. Kiko was unaware of this when she left the habitat. She went for a walk and collapsed a hundred meters from the house. She was affected and fell down a slope, where she was found by some individuals who took her down to the city.”

Peter just stared at the screen in shock. “And you didn’t feel the need to wake me?”

“I was not informed to awaken you; Kiko’s last instruction was to let you sleep.” The AI replied, and Peter let out a groan.

“Are you kidding me? If any of us is in danger, you inform the other. Is that clear?”

“Affirmative! Setting new.”

“Now give me her location and lock down the container after I leave. Only open for Kiko or me, bind the lock to our DNA.”

“Affirmative! No other than Peter Fordhall, Kiki Lee, and their offspring will have access. DNA lock engaged.”   He stopped and looked back at the screen. Offspring?

“We have no children. Is she pregnant?”

“No, she is currently not pregnant, but the likelihood of her becoming pregnant is high.”

“So why mention offspring? Does she have children?”

“No, she had no children, but the lock is DNA based, your offspring will have the DNA codes to unlock the door once they are born.”

“You pranking..  god damnit..  give me her last known location.” He said as he loaded up with extra weapons. He grabbed extra mags and pistols for her as well. This was going to get bloody.  He suited up with the helmet and closed the air filter to avoid the gas, then grabbed her spare suit and helmet and went outside.

He walked out as dark clouds started to roll in from the north; it would be a rainstorm soon, and it suited his mood. He was going to kill somebody for taking her away from him. He put the spare weapons in the cargo hold after checking every weapon. He even had two cryo grenades. He looked at them, and his mind got tossed back to the camp.

The door had exploded inwards as the giant bugs could be heard screeching and dying. Marines in mech suits walked into the camp like divine retribution, blasting the outer bug hive and defense wall apart. Transports dropped from the sky and opened their backs before ever landing, inside the holding cells, black-clade marines, mostly humans, and Nalos moved in with military precision, shooting the guards and opening cell doors. Nobody was left behind. He had been in the last transport as it took off; it should have been his last day. The damn monsters had picked him for incubation. He had one of those bugs inside of him as he was rescued. He expected a quick death, and he told them to leave him, telling them he was infected.  The marine had removed his mask, revealing a human face. He had looked at him and smiled. “You don’t have to worry about that. We have a morning-after pill for just those cases.” He had pushed him out the door and slapped his ass, telling him to stop kissing a stranger.”  Then they had put him in cryosleep.

He looked at the grenade in his hand and grinned. “Kiko is no stranger.”

Hegot on the scooter, detached it, and flew straight up, then down to where Kiko had been taken. He looked around and didn’t see any sign of struggle. He turned his attention towards the city where Kiko was being held.

The huge city was built around a small round lake, with two islands in it. It looked artificial, built with technology beyond what they had shown. There, the lake was connected by a river running through it.  Along the sides of the huge, round lake, the city sprawled until it hit the first wall, then a new, much less impressive building took over until the outer walls, which were heavily defended, outside small villages and farms, sprawled as far as the eye could see. The rivers seemed artificially created, and they ran in a large loop from the ocean, some ten kilometers away. The city was built for two things: war and power.

On the small island, there was a large building with the same strange design, a mix of Roman and old Japanese styles. Only accessible by boat, or so they thought. Well, today they will get a visit from an angry god.  He roared up in the sky and aimed for the palace, praying Kiko was still alive.",15,1766428295.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I’m 33 and born and raised in Michigan. I’m looking to meet new people to chat with, share laughs, and build some genuine friendships. I really enjoy connecting with people who are easygoing, curious, and enjoy good conversation.

A little about me:

I love anything outdoors during the warmer months, hiking, kayaking, camping, or just exploring new places and soaking up fresh air. There is something about being outside that always resets my mind and energy.

In the winter, I slow down a bit and become more of a homebody. I enjoy reading, bingeing TV shows, sipping coffee, and just relaxing in a cozy environment. Quiet nights in can be just as fun as an adventurous day outdoors.

I’m friendly, laid back, and when I get comfortable around someone, I can be pretty silly and playful. I love making people laugh and enjoy humor in all its forms.

I value honesty, consistency, and someone who enjoys sharing stories, ideas, or even just random thoughts about life. I think friendships grow best when there is an easy, natural connection.

I’m open to chatting with anyone, whether you’re nearby or further away. I enjoy discussing hobbies, life, experiences, or just sharing fun, random moments. If you’re looking for someone who is attentive, genuinely interested in getting to know people, and enjoys both meaningful conversation and lighthearted fun, I would love to hear from you!

My Mother was like that and I thought that was because she just wanted a clean home. But as I got older I realized that going into a psychotic rage because there was a cup on coffee table wasn’t normal. If our home wasn’t model home Zillow picture perfect at all times, it was “dirty”. It wasn’t dirty it just looked like people live here.

I remember being woken up in the middle of the night at like 8 years old and my Mother forced me to re-clean the bathroom. The bathroom was clean but not to her standards, she went into a rage and destroyed the bathroom. I was up until 5am cleaning up AJax, Clorox, lotion bottles off the floor. She had this habit of going around the house in the middle of night searching for “messes”. If it was a mess, I was ripped out of bed at 2am and had to clean it. 

I’ve noticed that she is not able to focus on anything else until it’s perfect. If I left my jacket on the chair because I was heading back out soon, she wouldn’t stop yelling about it until it was gone. The bathroom was “disgusting” because my hairbrush and was sitting on the counter and not in the drawer where it belongs. Or when it came to cleaning, it had to be done right then and there. If it was 10 at night and I had a long day the kitchen needed to swept right now. If couldn’t wait until morning even though it wasn’t visibly dirty.

**Chapter 86. Adventures of Snow White, Cinderella and Baba Yaga** 

  
Since we were running on short notice, we decided to fly Opal to Ironwatch to get there faster. “Um, what was it that Cuthbert needed our help with again?” Lily asked as she steered the windcleaver.

“The gangsters, Lily,” I said. “They call themselves Iron Snakes. They have been pressuring Cuthbert to manufacture more guns for them and want to use his supply line to smuggle guns across the province.”

Lily whistled softly. “That's quite elaborate. Are you sure this gang is filled with rookies? Those are some good ideas, objectively speaking.”

“Since when did extortion become a good idea?” I asked.

“Depends on who your target is,” Smokewell said. She was sitting in a leather backpack I had put on, her head sticking out of the main compartment and her whiskers tickling my cheek. “Not all criminals are bad people. Look at us.”

“We aren't criminals, Madam,” Lily said. “We are outlaws.”

“That doesn't sound much different,” I said.

“No, you see a criminal is someone who commits *crimes*. An outlaw is someone who breaks the law. Breaking the law is only a crime when you piss off the government,” Lily said.

“That's my girl.” Smokewell reached out to pat Lily with a paw.

“Thank you, madam!” Lily said sweetly.

I had a good retort for both of them but I don't think it would've stood much chance against the mother-daughter moment the two were having.

\--

Eugene Cuthbert was a rotund man in his late thirties. The last time I met him, he looked like a rich and healthy guy. But the threats from the gang had visibly worn him down. Even his round face was starting to look gaunt now.

I had sent a telegram ahead of time to Ironwatch, warning him to cancel any and all visits he might've planned and to not to let his family leave the house until we showed up.

Cuthbert's house was a surprisingly humble looking structure. Only two stories tall, a perimeter wall from all sides without a large yard or a patio and a single steam carriage standing in the driveway. Compared to all the places of the rich I'd seen in Orowen, his house didn't look much different from our own in the Burning Bend.

A cute golden retriever who had been resting in his kennel by the east wall noticed us walking through the gates and started barking. “Oh, look at him, such a good little boy!” Lily said, hopping over to the dog with a merry spring in her step.

Even the canine looked surprised at her forwardness and had to pause. Lily patted the dog on his head and scratched his side gently. “Aren't you a good boy? Guarding the house by yourself. Do you want a jerky? Here you go!” She pulled out a scrap of dried meat from her pocket and waved it a bit before dropping it in front of him.

The dog looked at her for a second before sniffing at the piece of meat and gobbling it up in a minute. Soon, his tongue came out and his tail began to wag. “Such a good boy!” Lily patted his head again. And noticed the name painted on the front of the kennel. “Aren't you a good boy, Ted?”

The dog gave a small happy bark.

“Remind me to not let her touch me without washing her hands,” Smokewell said from the backpack.

“Miss Snow White?” Cuthbert said, coming out of the house.

Lily hopped away from the dog who followed after her excitedly. “Yessir! That's Miss Snow White. I'm Cinderella and this is our lovely Miss Baba Yaga,” she said, pulling Smokewell out of the backpack and holding her up like a prize.

“Who the hell would call themselves Baba Yaga?” the cat grumbled.

Cuthbert looked confused at the talking cat.

“Don't mind her,” I said. “We flew here so she is a bit grouchy.”

If we really wanted to take down the Order of the Unseen, we couldn't let our real names come out in all of this. I'd grabbed enough attention since I'd arrived in this new world already. And it had taken a fair share of risks to clear our names from the Inquisition's burn list. In the hands of someone like the angels or the Order of the Unseen, our real names were vulnerable. They could use their power and connections to set us back on square one. Thus, we had to work with these aliases.

Cuthbert didn't seem to find our names weird either way, nor did it seem to bother him that our cat could talk. Worry and anxiety flickered in his eyes again. “We did as you told,” he said. “No one has stepped out of the gates since I received your telegram.”

“Good,” I said and we walked in.

“You should let Ted stay inside too,” Lily said, whistling at the dog to call him over. “Don't you have a little daughter? They both will keep each other company while we take care of your problem.”

“You're right,” Cuthbert said absentmindedly, letting the dog into the house. “Carla,” He called out and a little girl of about five or six years came downstairs. “Take Ted to your room with you and don't come down.”

The golden retriever rushed over to the girl and nuzzled her hip. The girl had two small pig tails, a chubby face and she was wearing a floral pink and white dress. She regarded us curiously for a second before nodding to her dad. “Okay, papa,” she said.

“Um, wait,” I said a bit hesitantly. I dug into the pocket of my waist coat and fished out a handful of candies. “Do you like this?”

The girl looked at me as if she was holding back a frown. She looked at Cuthbert, as if asking for permission. Cuthebert smiled tiredly and nodded at her. She took the candies from my hand. “Thank you,” she said and curtsied and left to go upstairs with Ted at her side.

“A well mannered child,” I said to Cuthbert.

“She is,” he said. “All credit goes to her mother. She is intelligent like her as well. I feel glad that she hasn't taken much after me. I've only brought trouble to this house afterall.”

“Mr. Cuthbert,” Lily said sternly, instantly getting the man's attention. “Let's get one thing out of the way. The trouble in your house is caused by the people who are threatening you. You care about your family, that's why you called us. A man who didn't care would've skipped the town and his family altogether.”

“R-Right,” the man said sheepishly.

“We apologize for not coming sooner,” I said. “We had been caught up in some other business.”

“No need to apologize,” a woman said, appearing at the door of the hallway by the living room. Probably Cuthbert's wife, Enola. “I'm glad you are here now.”

“As you should be,” Lily said. “We'll solve your problem so well that all your other problems will feel scared of giving you any more trouble.”

I dug into my backpack and pulled out a loaded paper bag. I moved up to Cuthbert's wife and handed it to her. “These are some cakes and pastries we bought on the way. It felt like a good idea,” I said shyly.

“Cakes are seldom a bad idea,” Cuthbert's wife said with a small smile. “I'll go and serve these so we can all have some.”

“Save our cake for later,” Smokewell said. “We have to make some arrangements around the house first.”

It took us thirty minutes to make the necessary arrangements. After we were done, Enola asked if we would like to have tea.

“We would prefer coffee,” I said. “We are going to need it to stay vigilant throughout the night.

Enola brought us the drinks, then she looked at Smokewell hesitantly. “Um, what about…Miss Baba Yaga?” she said.

“Don't worry about me. I have this,” the cat said and held up her ivory pipe before lighting the tobacco and taking a drag.

Enola was obviously not expecting the cat to start smoking but tried to keep her expression neutral. “Baba Yaga, we are at the client's house! You didn't even ask if it was okay to smoke,” Lily said, folding her arms across her chest.

The cat looked at the girl, unamused. Enola quickly said, “No, it's okay. She can smoke if she wants.” Then she turned to me and said, “Um, would you be joining us for dinner?”

“Of course!” Lily said before anyone could answer. “We would love to.”

Enola gave a big smile. “Wonderful. Eugene is setting the table right now. We'll have the meal in a few minutes,” she said.

Smokewell sighed and blew a cloud of smoke. “Why would you do that?” she said to Lily. “You really want to intrude upon a family dinner?”

“She offered to let us join them. You think I should've turned her down? Also, I'm hungry for some good home cooked food,” Lily said.

“Quit bickering you two,” I said, taking a sip of my coffee. “How about we don't let our focus waver until the job is done?”

The cat raised an eyebrow at me. “You are the leader now?”

“You could've been the leader if you weren't too busy arguing,” I said.

“When did we agree to make you the leader?” she said, pursing her lips.

“Just now,” Lily said. “I vote for Snow White as our leader.”

“See?” I grinned. “Cinderella agrees.”

“I haven't agreed, you idiot. Which means you have an equal number of ‘for’ and ‘against’ votes. That's called a deadlock,” she said.

“Oh yeah?” I smirked. “I didn't know that since you didn't send us to a proper school.”

The cat groaned and took another puff from her pipe.

“But, getting back on track,” I said. “How did the arrangements go?” I looked at Lily.

“All my summoning cards are in their place,” she said proudly. “I can activate them when I need to within a blink. I enhanced my summoning before coming here.”

“I checked around the perimeter wall. And I wandered around outside for a bit to check if anyone suspicious was keeping an eye on the house,” Smokewell said. “There was no one like that.”

“I put bottles of abyss around the house. In other words I have eyes and ears almost everywhere.” I nodded and looked at Lily. “Did you find a spot?”

“Yes,” Lily said. “I checked the basement. It's a bit dark but if we put a lamp and a mattress or two in there then the family can squat down there for the night.”

“You think the men from the gang will break into the house?” Smokewell said.

“If they get impatient,” I said. “But it might take some time for them to get impatient.”

“Are you hoping to deal with them here? While the family is in the house?” Smokewell said.

“Yes,” I said without hesitation. “Because this area is under our complete control. They come in here, none of them is going to leave the house alive.”

“There's a child in the house, Miss Snow White,” Lily said. “You want her to see bloodshed?”

“I want her to be able to start going back to school instead of staying hidden in her house scared of a bunch of thugs,” I said. “Plus, she will be in the basement anyway. She won't see anything. If it is so bad, we'll give her a sleeping potion. She'll wake up tomorrow and all the problems will have vanished.”

“Not a bad idea. But that depends on whether the thugs decide to break into the house tonight,” Smokewell said.

That's when little Carla came from the hallway leading to the kitchen. “Excuse me,” she said. “Mama told me to come and call you for dinner.”

“Splendid!” Lily said. “We were famished. Lead the way, young miss.”

Carla suppressed the small smile at Lily's antics and led us to the dining room.

Cuthbert was the one cooking. And he seemed to be good at it too. He'd even made separate meals for the adults as well as little Carla. The kid was served a portion of roast duck with orange glaze while the rest of us had braised duck with peas. As Carla got her plate, she pouted a bit. “I want to eat the same as Mama,” she said.

“No, Carla, that has wine in it. You know the rules,” Cuthbert said as he laid the plates on the table.

“It's okay, Eugene,” Enola said gently, “I used to have food with wine in it when I was young. It won't hurt to let Carla have a taste.”

Eugene looked at his wife with a frown. Then he sighed in defeat. “A bite is fine, I guess.”

Enola smiled and put a piece from her own portion in Carla’s plate.

“The meal looks delicious, Mr. Cuthbert,” I said as the man finally settled at the table.

“Thank you,” he said curtly.

Carla was about to dig into the food right away when Enola said gently but sternly, “Carla, did you forget your manners?”

“Let her eat,” Cuthbert said. Something about his voice sounded like he was trying to not snap. “It's not like it means anything.”

“Eugene, don't say that,” Enola said. “I know we aren't in the most ideal situation right now. But it doesn't mean that God hates us.”

Cuthbert set his jaw and sighed in defeat again. “Say your prayer, Carla.”

The little girl joined her hands and closed her eyes. She began to pray. “O Breath of Steam, who warms our bread. Who turns the wheels and keeps us fed. Bless these hands that made our meal. Bless our hearts with strength and steel. In smoke, in heat, in clinking gears. We thank You now with humble cheer.”

As the little girl said her prayers, I stole glances of her father. And I couldn't help but feel bad for the man. I'd done some digging on him after I'd met him for the first time. He came from a family of farmers, studied hard and became an engineer in a world where engineers were considered the new wizards. He had made a name for himself. Until he gathered enough wealth to move to Ironwatch and start his own business. He had remained humble throughout his ascent in wealth. It was visible in the house he had built and the meals that he cooked for his family and there he sat now, his lips sealed and his forehead scrunched, because that same humility he had worn like a badge of honor was now weighing down on his shoulders. And he had to act like God somehow cared for him. But Eugene didn't snap. Didn't flip the table. Didn't storm away. I admired him for that.

After Carla was done with the prayer, we were about to start eating. But the door bell rang.

Eugene looked at me and Lily as if he had seen the Death Reaper standing behind us with a scythe.

“I'll check the door,” Enola said hesitantly.

“No.” Eugene grabbed her wrist.

“I won't open it, dear,” she said reassuringly. “I'll just see through the peephole.”

“I'll come with you, Miss Cuthbert,” Lily said, getting up from her chair.

Eugene looked at me. “You don’t have anything to worry about. We are here,” I said. He hesitantly let go of his wife's hand.

Lily and Enola left to go and check the door. They came after a minute. Enola was frowning in worry. “It's the Internal Police, dear,” she said.

I looked at Eugene. “Didn't you say the police are working with those guys?” I asked.

1pt6ydl,https://www.reddit.com/r/southafricanmoney/comments/1pt6ydl/am_i_delusional/,Am I delusional?,"Hi guys, South African M22 here.

The cost of living is concerning to me and I don’t know whether my expectations for myself are unrealistic.

My wife and I moved in together when I was 19. At the time we survived on a monthly household income of around R12K. We didn’t have it easy, but our lights were always on, bellies always full and bed always warm. We also had enough fuel to drive to hiking trails every weekend and grab a coffee at a farm stall every Sunday. 

Fast forward around 3 years. I now run a small business that brings in anything north of R20K per month. 

My wife fell pregnant earlier this year and decided to stop working and focus on being a mother. I fully support her decision and adore the idea of her being a stay at home mommy.

My concern is that I can’t even afford to pay my tax and my boy is being born in Jan. 

It feels like we used to get by with nothing but now buying groceries is challenge.

Well i ended up trying out a few different options and figured id come back and share how its been going.

So i actually tested out Coinbase card first since its pretty popular and everyones heard of it. Its not bad but honestly the fees were kinda annoying and the whole process felt more clunky than i wanted. Just wasnt as smooth as i hoped it would be.

Then i looked into Bybit card cause i already had an account there. Setup took forever though and honestly it felt like they were more focused on their exchange stuff than making payments easy. Just wasnt the vibe i was looking for.

I also gave Kast a shot but ran into some issues with availability in my area and the support wasnt great when i had questions. Kinda gave up on that one pretty quick.

Finally tried Oobit and honestly this is where i settled. Setup was way easier than the others, downloaded the app, connected my wallet, and basically was ready to go pretty quick. The interface is honestly not bad at all, way more straightforward than what i dealt with before.

Ive used it a few times now for actual purchases and its been working smooth. Literally just tap your phone like youre using Apple Pay or Google Pay and boom, payment goes through. The cashier doesnt even know youre paying with crypto which is kinda the point i guess. It just shows up as a regular card payment on their end.

What i really like compared to the others is that theres no complicated conversion process or waiting around. You pay with your crypto and it handles everything instantly. The fees seem way more reasonable too compared to what Coinbase was charging me.

I tested it at a coffee shop, grocery store, and online for some stuff and all of them worked without issues. Its actually pretty wild being able to spend your coins this easily in places that definitely dont accept crypto directly.

Only thing is you gotta have the app open and ready but thats not really a big deal. Battery usage hasnt been bad either if anyone was wondering about that.

Anyway just wanted to update everyone since you guys helped me out with suggestions. Tried a bunch of options but Oobit ended up being the winner for me. If anyones still looking for an easy way to actually use their crypto for everyday stuff this ones been solid so far.

I have a hybrid office/remote work arrangement and I travel back and forth between my work town and my parents' town. He works full remote and lives next his parents as well, he sees them constantly and eats with them. He doesn't even have a washing machine, so he's dependent upon his parents. I go on dates with him when I'm in my work town (usually twice a week), in the evening, because I tend to work in the office until late. I recognize that it's part my fault we have little time together. So why I'm annoyed?

Everytime we go out:

1)we either have dinner with his parents

2)he finds an excuse to visit his parents after dinner and we stay there at least 1/1h30 hour, talking with his parents or playing with his dog if his parents are occupied with other things.

Also he ""blames"" me because I work until it's late and I'm not available on week ends so we haven't time but how does use this time? He wastes it in my opinion, I'm not willing to giving him more time to waste, in fact I would like to reduce our dates, refusing to see him if he plans to spend the evening at his parents and using my time with my friends or on my hobbies.

Now, after I blew up at him he apologised but said he spent just 1h 30 with his father. He broke the day tho. Every plan has become impossible that day.

I'm pissed. Am I the asshole? I may be because I'm very self-centered too, I work a lot and it's true we see each other at 20 pm, so late, and I indeed spend a lot of my days in my parents' town so it sounds hypocritical to accuse him of not protecting our time together. On the other side, visiting his parents WHILE we're on dates is a step above imho. We can out less and he can spend some evenings with his parents and some with me, alone.

## --[ 2 - How The Pig Thinks in 0.1.7

    cafe scenario (stationary, 5-15 networks):
    OINK scans 5 seconds. finds 8 networks. probes each for PMKID 
    (300ms per AP). locks to strongest signal, camps 4-5 seconds 
    sniffing client MACs from data frames. attacks discovered clients
    with targeted deauth bursts. waits 4.5 seconds for late EAPOL. 
    moves to next target. if 3 targets fail, pig gets bored. waits 30s. 
    tries again. whole loop runs until handshake captured or you leave.
    
    DNH in same cafe: cycles channels 120-375ms each. busy channels 
    (8+ beacons) get longer dwell. detects natural reconnects (phone 
    wakes from sleep, laptop opens). camps 600ms when EAPOL burst 
    detected. captures handshake from organic traffic. no deauth. 
    no fingerprint. just patience.
    
    walking scenario (high churn, 100+ networks):
    OINK targets shift constantly. network ages out after 30s 
    (wardriving mode) or 60s (stationary). state machine validates 
    target still exists before each phase. if cleanup deleted it 
    mid-attack, pig moves on. no stuck states.
    
    DNH in same walk: Multi-Armed Bandit prioritization. channels 
    1, 6, 11 get 250ms base (primary spectrum). dead channels get 
    120ms fast-sweep. IDLE_SWEEP activates when all 13 channels 
    show zero activity. residential at 3am = mostly idle sweep. 
    downtown rush hour = mostly hunting.
    
    conference scenario (dense, hostile):
    OINK discovers 20 clients per AP (LRU eviction after 20). 
    targeted deauth per client is more effective than broadcast. 
    client count shown in bottom bar. captures happen faster 
    because more reconnection traffic.
    
    DNH handles density via stats decay every 2 minutes. prevents 
    stale channel priority. hunts EAPOL bursts from the chaos. 
    captures happen because people walk in and out constantly.
    
    D key switches between modes. no WiFi restart. 
    promiscuous callback shared. 
    one codebase, one opportunity.
    two philosophies. 
    hooligan punches. rasta observes. 
    same prey. different ethics.
    except strlen.

I'm very self-centered too, I work a lot and it's true we see each other at 20 pm, so late, and I indeed spend a lot od days and most week ends in my parents' town so it sounds hypocritical to accuse him of not protecting our time together versus his family time. On the other side, visiting his parents WHILE we're on dates is a step above imho. 

He thinks I don't like his parents but I think they're ok people, it's his own behaviour that annoys me.

What I do?

1)Reduce the frequency of our dates and we have to spend the evening alone. It raises the quality of our time and give him more time to be with his parents and more time to me to use as I please. That's rational but he may not like it, ideally he'd like to spend every evening available all together. 

2)Big confrontation, he take action when I get very angry, but it's damagin log term.

3)Monitoring time when we're at his parents and cut it off after 20 minutes, it sounds toxic tho.

4)Giving the couple more time, but I feel I'm already tight with my schedule and I believe he would waste it being at his parents'

Then I would like you to guess why does he do that. He says his parents guilt trip him but they seem like ok with him not spending every evening with them and he stays there even if they ignore him. I thought he's too enmeshed, writing this post I realized maybe he's not 100% at ease with me. ",1,1766427736.0,relationship_advice,7,1.0,False

I recently started liking coffee and have been looking to buy an espresso machine to make them from home rather than going out and buying one from coffee shops/buying bottles of cold brew. i also think it would be nice to make coffees for people who come over. I have looked into the nespresso since it’s beginner friendly but the pods sound like a pain to have to purchase and also wasteful. I have seen a lot of things on the ninja luxe cafe but have seen people either love it or hate it. I have several other ninja appliances that work great but this one seems to have more issues.

As someone who is a beginner with little to no knowledge about grind sizes, what a good espresso shot should be, etc./not a coffee snob (yet), would you recommend this? I also want something that will last long and I don’t know how this machine does over time ",2,1766427674.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,2,1.0,False
1pt6st6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Creepystories/comments/1pt6st6/my_dad_came_back_from_his_fishing_trip_three_days/,My dad came back from his fishing trip three days ago. He hasn’t left his truck.,"I’m 32, and I’ve been staying with my parents for a few weeks while my house gets treated for termites. My parents have been married for thirty-five years. They’re that ""perfect"" couple everyone knows—until last Thursday.

My dad went on his annual solo fishing trip up to the Upper Peninsula. He was supposed to be gone for a week, but he pulled into the driveway three days early, at 2:00 AM on Friday.

He never came inside.

I woke up when I heard his Ford F-150 crunching on the gravel. I looked out the window, expecting him to stumble in exhausted, but the engine just kept idling. Then he turned it off. The lights went black. And he just... sat there.

When I went out to check on him, he had the doors locked. He wouldn't roll down the window more than a crack. His face was pale, and he looked like he hadn't slept in forty-eight hours. I asked him what was wrong, if he’d hit a deer or something.

He just looked at the front door of the house—where my mom was standing in the window, waving—and whispered, ""That's not her, son. Don't let her bring me anything.""

I thought he was having a stroke or some kind of breakdown. But for three days, he hasn't moved. He won't go to the bathroom. He won't eat. My mom has been acting ""perfect."" Too perfect. She’s been making his favorite meals, humming to herself, and carrying trays out to the driveway.

Every time she approaches the truck, my dad starts shaking. He won't touch the food. He waits until she goes back inside, then he throws the plates into the woods behind the driveway.

This morning, Mom went to the grocery store. As soon as her car pulled out of the cul-de-sac, my dad signaled me to come over. He handed me a crumpled piece of thermal paper—a receipt from a gas station three hundred miles away, dated the day he ""left.""

On the back, he’d scribbled a note: ""I forgot my tackle box. I turned around twenty minutes after I left on Thursday. I came back inside and saw her. I saw your mother in the kitchen. But I also heard her singing in the shower upstairs. Two of them, son. I saw the one in the kitchen drop a raw steak on the floor and start eating it like a dog. I didn't say a word. I just walked back out, got in the truck, and I haven't been back in that house since.""

I told him he was crazy. I told him Mom was right here.

But then I went into the kitchen to make coffee. I looked at the ""Mom"" who was currently putting away the groceries she just bought. She was whistling that same tune my dad mentioned.

I dropped my spoon. It bounced under the fridge. When I knelt down to grab it, I saw her feet.

She wasn't wearing shoes. And she wasn't wearing socks. Her feet were perfectly smooth—no toes. Just two blunt, fleshy points pressing against the tile.

She noticed me looking. She didn't look down; she just kept whistling, but the sound started coming from her throat without her mouth moving.

I’m back in my room now. I just looked out the window. My dad is staring at me from the truck. He’s holding up a sign he must have written on an old map.

It says: CHECK THE TRUNK OF HER CAR.

I can hear her coming up the stairs. She’s knocking on my door right now. She says she has a ""surprise"" for me and Dad.

The weirdest part? I can hear the shower running in the master bathroom. And Mom—the one at my door—just growled.",4,1766427657.0,Creepystories,0,1.0,False

1pt6pnx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoXChromosomes/comments/1pt6pnx/having_no_friends_as_a_girl_puts_you_in_an/,Having no friends as a girl puts you in an impossible loop,"I’m honestly fed up. I’m 19 and kind of in an awkward phase of my life where I’m taking a break from college (for medical reasons… another story) and so I’m stuck in my hometown, but no longer in contact with my high school friends. They’re all away at school. 

So naturally, I do not have a strong social life right now. I crave having girls to hang out with and honestly mainly just miss having events to go to on special occasions, like Christmas or New Year’s Eve. I came to rant because I realized that I will be home alone on NYE because my parents are actually invited to a party.

What puts me in this position where I’m struggling to even meet people is that why as girls do we need to already have friends to make friends? I am literally trying to put myself out there and meet new people but it’s like people smell my lonely aura and get scared away. 

I went to a “meet new people” event that a coffee shop was hosting the other week and, surprise, not more than 10 or 12 people showed up. The kicker? Every single person there actually came with a friend or a group. I was the only person who showed up alone. It shouldn’t have even surprised me that everybody who did come was notably older than me (in 30s) and so all the people I did talk to treated me like I was weird or strange for showing up to such an event as a 19 year old. 

Does anybody have any advice for me on where to actually find friends my age? Things that aren’t just go to place XYZ and try to be social with people. If that worked by now, I should’ve had way more friends, but the issue is you need to show up to these social/hangout places with friends in order to not look like a weirdo.

Life moves fast enough, and I think the best things come when they are allowed to unfold naturally.

I’m a dentist by profession, but outside of work, I like to stay busy in other ways. I’ve got a couple of energetic puppies who keep me on my toes, and I love baking or trying new recipes in the kitchen. I’m also someone who needs to be active, so you’ll usually find me out running, hiking, or hitting the gym. But I’m just as content finding a quiet corner in a coffee shop or getting lost in a good conversation over dinner. I travel whenever I can and enjoy exploring new places, whether it’s a new city or a hidden gem in the countryside.

What I’m really looking for is someone who shares a similar mindset. I’m drawn to people with emotional maturity, intelligence, and kindness, people who can appreciate a good laugh, but also know how to hold deeper conversations. I appreciate those who enjoy the little things, like a calm afternoon or a good meal, but who also have the curiosity and drive to experience more and embrace new challenges. I like being around those who have their own sense of elegance, but who also don’t take themselves too seriously.

I think good company and a strong connection are the foundation of anything meaningful. I’m not looking for anything forced or rushed, but more like a natural bond that could evolve over time. No pressure, just two people enjoying each other’s presence and seeing where it leads.

If you are someone who appreciates this kind of easygoing, but intentional connection and is open to the idea of building something with time, I’d love to hear from you. Tell me something you are passionate about, or share a place you’ve always wanted to visit. Looking forward to connecting.",1,1766427453.0,r4r,1,1.0,False
1pt6pay,https://www.reddit.com/r/KitchenConfidential/comments/1pt6pay/personalmoral_dilemma/,Personal/moral dilemma,"Sorry in advance for the overly long post, need to set the scene.

Been in the industry for 25 years, worked everything from fast casual to fine dining, dishes, saute, all the way to exec and GM, it's the only thing I know.  A few years ago I left the industry and moved into grocery management in an attempt to save my failing marriage (spoiler alert: it did not work out).

A couple years after I get an offer that seems perfect. KM for a small, locally based, brunch chain that was expanding into my metro area. I describe the food as ""bougie white lady brunch"".  Great money, great hours, so I pull the trigger and jump back into the kitchen.

I help this group open two locations starting from the ground up. Meaning actually building equipment, setting up vendors, hiring staff, the whole yard. First location was physically a difficult space to make work, honestly just an awful spot to try and work a fully functional kitchen into but we make due. The GM and I have a great relationship and see eye to eye but the staff was a hot mess on both sides.

After four months I phase out of my position there to focus on getting the second location up and running. Exact opposite of the former, my kitchen staff was fucking amazing (FOH not so much), but the 25 year old GM was awful. She was hired due to her family being close with one of the higher ups and openly admitted that she got her only previous management experience because she slept with the owner of that restaurant.

Shit immediately hits the fan and she cuts and runs, leaving me to manage both sides alone for a couple months before they bring in a new GM.

One week after the new GM arrives she sits me down to tell me that ""things just aren't working out and she doesn't see a place there for me anymore"" AKA we don't want to pay your salary anymore.  Mind you this is one week after I turned 40, first time I've ever been fired, and two weeks before Thanksgiving. So of course no restaurant is highering for upper management in the thick of the holidays. I ended up unemployed for over three months before I sucked down my pride and crawled back to the grocery store.

Three weeks after my firing my old lead line cook calls me to tell me that the GM that fired me just got fired for filling her coffee mug up with vodka from the bar.

Here's the kicker, she just got hired part time at the store, where I am in management, in the beer and wine department.  I feel like I have an obligation to tell my store manager that we have just hired an alcoholic who has previously been caught drinking on the job, but I'm worried with our past history it could turn into some sort of HR issue, retaliation or what not.  I also hate this lady because she ruined my life for a few months now, and ruined my passion for kitchens.

I haven’t found many places to ask for help in tracking down a bowl like the one pictured.  Clearly it is broken, and that broke my partners heart.  A spice jar fell out of the cabinet on it.  

In my search for a replacement, I have found that they were made in at least 3 sizes - small (4.5”), medium (6”), and large (7”) - this being the medium size of around 6” in diameter and about 2.5” tall.  I see only the small and large versions for sale at the moment.

At the very least, if someone can translate the kanji on the bottom (which I hope can identify the manufacturer) that would be extremely helpful.  

You may understand that this is a highly sentimental item, half of a matched pair.  I am not wealthy, but am happy to buy a beer/tea/coffee as a finders fee, via Venmo or PayPal.
