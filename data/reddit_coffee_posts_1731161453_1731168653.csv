We'll meet at 34th and Walnut, go through Locust Walk to Locust Street. We'll get to Clark Park, buy the food, and take the Walnut Street bike lane to get to The People's Fridge at 52nd and Sansom. Then, we'll go back to Clark Park for some barbecue and pumpkin decorating/painting. Feel free to bring your own paint or glue(to glue flowers on). This isn't a PBA sponsored event, but it is being run by some members of PBA, including myself. Even of you don't have kids, please come. It's a great way to include kids in giving to their community and to show the community what's possible with bikes. ",1,1731168593.0,phillycycling,0,1.0,False

I'm sitting in Starbucks yesterday, applying to some jobs when four ""Dude-Bro-Man-Childs"" walk in. They get their coffee and sit down behind me.

Que Litany of Rogan, Bannon, Trump mouth diarrhea. I ignore it. Gonna have to for the next four years right?

Then they start shitting on Veilguard as they take out their laptops. This gives me an idea. No idea where It came from, but an idea.

I turn around and say, ""Actually. Not a bad game. But I guess if you hate WWE kind of stuff, it makes sense.""

They all stop talking and stare at me. ""What?""

""Well, yeah. I can understand that if you hate WWE the idea of unleashing wrestling moves in fantasy armor while pyrotechnics go off would be something you want to play.""

I start to turn around when I get a ""hold up!""

I explain the Grey Warden speciality to them, then spin up Veilguard on my laptop and proceed to dropkick+firebomb, etc moves.

You should have seen them leaning in.

Then one of them entered their Trump mind again.

""Yeah? What about all the gay relationships?

I shrugged as I switched over to my Mage save for another. ""I don't get into a gay relationship.""

He pushed ""What about the non-binary stuff they shove down your throat?""

""Taash? They're pretty cool, I missed all of it on my first play through, second after that? Eh? It's a quest? I just remember Them being snarky, but hey look at this...""

I chose Taash and let them loose. ""They're basically the angsty baby of Trogdor and the Diablo Barbarian.""

""Now who wants to see the reverse ghost buster that is the mage?""

An hour more of increasingly less stupid questions? There where four more Veilguard downloads.

Now comes a thoughtful article talking about the genesis of the trend, and I'm intrigued. Have you read anything in this genre?

For me, the closest I've come is a book about [workshops on dying](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30337608-ganbare-warsztaty-umierania) that were held in Japan following the horrific earthquake and tsunami in March 2011, so not ""healing fiction"" -- not aimed at healing the reader, but about the practice of healing itself. I found Ganbare! to be thought provoking, with ways of thinking about holding grief that I hadn't considered previously.

I think my reluctance around Before the Coffee Gets Cold and others in the genre comes from a feeling that grief and regret are more complex and deeper than can be healed by a short visit to the past. Also, I don't seem to have any past stuff that's unhealed -- not that all my family relationships are perfect, but that I'm comfortable and satisfied with where they landed. 

When I think of healing fiction written in English, I think of The Unlikely Pilgrimage of Harold Fry, by Rachel Joyce. The only magic here is the idea that you can, on a whim, take off on a walk across the country. But here, the ""Pilgrimage"" takes long enough that I felt like old Harold did have sufficient space to sort a lot out in his head. A great deal longer than the length of time it takes for coffee to grow cold. 

Do you read in the healing fiction genre? Do you find it soothing? Several people quoted in the article speak about crying as they read one of the books -- did you? ",4,1731168318.0,books,0,1.0,False

I've had existential OCD on and off for half of my life, and it's often accompanied by derealization episodes, where I feel like I'm about to ""learn"" that the absolute truth of reality is something awful, such as being tortured for eternity. It feels so silly in retrospect but in the moment it can feel so real that sometimes I wonder that what if my feelings were true and the more normal thoughts I get are simply denial? Does anyone else struggle with this kind of thing? It's super frustrating, especially since I was recovering but then had too much coffee :(

Though I always end up here, wanting to do better at college, wanting to get a job, eat healthier, exercise. I just feel like I can’t. I live at home, and if I think *Lets go do homework*, I have to do it in my room, or I’ll feel like I’m being judged by my family. Judged for what, I’m not sure? But if I try to do it in my room, I get distracted and can’t focus. I can’t go to a coffee shop, because that would involve telling my family I’m going out to do homework, and wasting money to do it. Not to mention, the feeling of everyone watching me as I just try to do work. I think it would be better if I moved out, but I can’t admit that I need to get a job. Because if I do, I’m admitting that school doesn’t need all the time I allow it. My family is good to me, so why do I feel like this? I try to do homework on campus, but it’s so easy to say “I can’t do this in an hour, and I barely have 30 minutes” then not even start. I won’t eat if I stay on campus after dinner, and that’s another thing I’m trying to work on. I can’t make myself get out of bed in the morning to go to campus early. And if I try, my brain tells me not to go out early because your family will ask where you’re going and you have to admit you’re doing homework.

Come get some bread at my place, as I have a truckload of good fresh stuff! 🍄♥️🙏","It is with heartfelt sadness that the Outreach Ministry Team of Covenant Church has had to lock the food fridge room on October 31st in response to misuse. The Free Fridge movement is set up as a ""take what you need and donate what you can,"" and for the most part, people responded with grace, self-control, and generosity. However, there has been persistent exploitation by a handful of people.

Interventions by the Outreach Ministry Team to resolve this over an extended period of time were not successful, leaving us with the hard decision to close the doors to take time to re-evaluate and seek solutions for this problem. We will be seeking wisdom from other organizations.

Hundreds of people have donated or taken food from our fridge responsibly, and we want to acknowledge the generosity both from the Covenant congregation and our local community in supplying food and funds, and the diligent and faithful volunteers who made it possible for the fridge to serve our community for the last three years. We will continue to host the weekly Thursday coffee hour and ""Soup for the Soul"" on the first and third Friday of the month, events that grew out of the connection to our community through the Free Food Fridge.

So I'm noticing more often than not that my coffees have a distinct grassy/farm yard smell and taste. The notes you should be expecting in the coffee are definitely there (currently brewing Ivan Solis COE#1 from Manhattan), however they are severely muted by the farm yard notes.

The coffee has been resting for 2 weeks now, and I am grinding between 6 and 7 on my Ode Gen 2 with stock burrs. I use either store bought mineral water, or filtered tap water, and the problem persists on both occasions. Is this a situation where I just need to let the coffee rest more, or perhaps grind finer? I am enjoying the vibrant juicyness of the coffee, so grinding finer I am afraid I'll lose those notes. I just am at my wits end on how to get rid of it.

I do have to say that this isn't just happening to the current coffee, but also several coffee's I've brewed from DAK and Sprout roasters. Is this an inherent problem with these types of beans and roasting process/level, or am I doing something horribly wrong?

I’ve went out on a date it went really well. We just met for coffee. 

Things are starting to look up again. My ex and I are listing the house next week which is awesome. She left the house so just me and my daughter live here. I can’t wait to get out of this house. 

I believe I finally pushed through to the acceptance phase of the grief process. I haven’t had any violent intrusive thoughts in a long time. Maybe 2 weeks. And I gotta thank God for getting me this far. At first as many of you know, I was devastated. But now I know that I’m way better off without her. She can kiss my ass. I go no contact with her unless it pertains to the kids, something related to selling the house or bills or anything legal which has helped tremendously. With the kids we will always have to talk at least a small amount. 

But I have a million friends and a small family but they all support me and that’s been the biggest help besides my God. I’ve been getting plugged back into church and that has helped tremendously. 

So that’s my post about being grateful of where I am today. 

And I gotta say that this Reddit forum has been very instrumental in helping me heal. One day at a time we will all get better. Gotta put in the work. Journaling, praying, getting active, eating healthy, seeing a counselor, starting a new routine and not giving yourself a hard time for any mistakes you make after the separation because believe me I sure did.

Bad coffee just doesn't taste bitter. Bad coffee is sour, burnt, salty and tastes like hell you want to spit it right away after the sip. It all comes down to the conditions on how the coffee was prepared. If I order coffee and I don't hear the sound of the burr grinder I'm already sad. Don't be mad at me for this.

Good extracted coffee has natural sweetness even if without a mixture of sauces and flavors.

Any coffee that has been mixed with flavors is purely cheating. Just my opinion. After all, flavorings just mask out the imperfections of an under extracted or overly extracted coffee. 

And lastly I would like to call out Starbucks for not training their staff properly at a branch I frequently visit.

(very important to read the TL;DR for context)

TL;DR: a “nice guy/hopeless romantic” (m) friend with romantic feelings demanded daily texts, first initiatives, and equal time in our friendship. i (f) made it clear i’m not emotionally available in any form. he consistently messaged me and showed up uninvited (once after i blocked him) twice to my doorstep. after i missed a coffee hangout (which he secretly called a date), he unfriended me and sent negative texts about how i used his vulnerability against him, claiming he’s “come to peace” with it and that it’s up to me now. when we were supposed to walk alone together (his idea) to restart with new expectations and boundaries, i got uncomfortable with his obsessive behavior and blocked him, prioritizing my safety and mental health. AITAH for not giving him a chance, even though he was overall a good person who just cared too much? is equal reciprocation earned, or assumed when a party is very invested?

i’ll start by saying i don’t regret prioritizing myself, however i do hold much guilt for hurting him. there have been times where i have opened his texts and choose not to respond. the inability to muster motivation to speak to people is not uncommon within me, and a struggle that i feel comes from my very introverted lack of social battery. i feel like social media had affected that part of me, and why i distance myself from people trying to get too close. 

his advances were emotional, and what i believe is based off trauma bonding or assumptions. i think i should’ve recognized it sooner. there are a few things i wish hadn’t happened that i’d attribute the issue to: 
-the night he drove/carried me back into my apartment when i was blacked out from a party (he confessed to someone that he saw me in a “different light” that night in relation to romance. maybe a sympathy crush, feeling sympathetic towards me due to his previous trauma or perhaps heroic chivalry in saving a damsel in distress.) 
-a different night where he asked me to go look at stars and i agreed, naively believing it to be truly platonic. he initiated very sensitive discussions about personal trauma, of which i listened and engaged with some of my own experiences
-times of personal and deep questions that i wasn’t comfortable answering, but did anyways in order to force the genuine closeness he sought between us (all within short spans of knowing each other)
-another time he believed i was talking to someone and lied to him about emotionally availability, and left the party with a fit of jealousy that people could feel. why did he feel entitled to baseless assumptions about me? because he heard me talk about an ex? would that topic matter in a platonic friendship?
-he said he created a safe space for me to be myself, and that i had chosen to not use it. for a while, patience was his virtue. i did believe his intentions to be true and without return. but that small pocket of safety, had justified expectations in his light. he unintentionally generalized my entire being into a section of his life by saying see saw a hurt younger version of himself in me. (did it stem from our short exchanges of trauma? could i have prevented this ideology?) 

despite these red flags, i know i purposefully ignored my instincts and carried on this friendship. i mentioned already a couple times that i’m not looking for a partner, when it was brought up. he let my words be buried underneath the preaching of his voice to let nature take its course. i wanted to avoid repeated confrontation, and future awkwardness in mutual friend circles, so i let it go. we would often see each other on campus, or at gatherings. maybe in a way, it was my fault i didn’t stop it sooner. maybe all the hurt i caused him wouldn’t have happened. all the hurt he caused me. i know i didn’t feed into his persistence, but i didn’t stop it until it became obsessive. 

there was a time he left letters in a bag on my front doorstep at 3am. 3am, standing at my front door. within them, he told me about his pestering desires to get closer and foster a relationship with me. his self proclaimed hopeless romantic self, wished that i could care as much as he did. he wanted to know my favorite color, my pet peeves- things i kept deepest within my being. it was at this point, i realized i needed to put my boundaries and feelings into a real thing to hold and read. so of course, i wrote him back one letter. one letter to make sure i was clear, my vulnerability and all. 

pretty much it summed to this:
“i appreciate you being honest about your feelings, but i want to be clear that i’m not emotionally available and won’t be in the future [insert brief mention from past trauma]. i value the time you’ve put into our friendship, but no matter how hard i try, i know i can’t promise that i’ll meet your expectations as a friend. i need patience to let my walls down.” 

when i say his standards were high, they were high. he required unrequited and equal reciprocation, because it was an ultimatum put upon me. in other words, i’m either everything or nothing to him. if i was everything to him, then what do you think he wanted?

i had hoped he understood clearly. but he didn’t. time and time again, he would message my number or other my social medias until i replied to either. during midterms too, mind you. there’s a lot of things that contribute to a busy schedule for me, and when i wind down for relaxation, i don’t include mandatory responses as part of that. me time should be how i see fit to use it. he said if i had time to have discord open and have my status as listening to music, i had time to respond to him. there were times he lectured me on what “makes a good friend”. passive aggressively mentioned how i never give him the time of day (although we went to eat just last week). 

there came a time after he quietly unfriended me and stopped messaging me for about a week, that he asked to talk over coffee. “not a date right,” i joked. “not a date.” he grimaced back, with a frown you could feel over text. little did i know behind my back, he considered it one to others. “i give my world to this girl and she doesn’t even want to respond to a text!” amongst things he would tell his friends. this is where i do believe i am to blame heavily, having missed this unknowingly important meeting. i apologized profusely and we rearranged for another day. the day had came, and just an hour before the selected time, he messaged me that he returned my letter i had given him on my car window. 

“what are you saying, no coffee?” i asked over a confused message. 

“i’ve come to peace with it. we can continue if you have questions,” he replied. 

cowardice, i thought to myself in a fit of disbelief and frustration. an act of selfishness and contempt for rejection. an action to feel what i had done rather than the words i said to listen. i still don’t understand why it took me missing coffee for him to understand. why did that speak louder than my words? i wrote to him this final time how unfairly he set upon these expectations for me to return affection and care. that yes, of course his confession of love would affect our platonic friendship in its initial building stage. why else-

3 loud knocks. 

he came to my front door again as i was typing. uninvited- unapologetic. apparently, he was in the neighborhood and found it convenient to leave the letter rather than just give it to me at coffee in an hour. what followed was me sitting down on my porch, and him pacing around and venting about how my communication skills lacked, how he wished he felt valued by me, how selfish i am to forget that he is also a human with feelings. 

maybe in some sick way, yes- his feelings mattered more than mine. was it because he had more? his investment in me obviously was more than what i could give back.

if i wasn’t interrupted and spoken over, he’d known that my communication skills weren’t nonexistent. i DID set time aside for our friendship. i let him join me to eat dinner and paid for his food on short notice. the time he asked to buy me dinner, he didn’t even check if the restaurant was open. i DID ask about his day and when he would be free to share a calls or hang out. i WAS there the times he asked for emotional confidentiality because he wanted to confide in me about his family. i LISTENED to his feelings, and validated them. i DID show my respect and care, just in ways he found worthless because it would’ve never been enough.

but yeah. maybe i shouldn’t have blocked him the next week we tried to reconnect on a nature “walk”. maybe the sick awful feeling in my stomach were just nerves and not a worry of what desperation does in a man’s heart for a woman when they’re alone. maybe, he called the night prior not to instigate and further berate me for bringing up how his feelings had affected our friendship, but rather to make me understand his side and remind me he has found his peace. i’m glad he found his peace. perhaps after i sent my final “i’m done” text, that was my own selfish peace.

because when i blocked him, he came to my front door again. knocked another 3 times harder than the last. 

but i didn’t open the door this time. AITAH?



end: thank you for reading. i’d love to hear your responses to my questions i had at the END of my TL;DR summary. there’s no black or white, only individualistic truths that we can’t call the objective truth without certainty. my truth will never be mark’s truth, nor will his be mine.

1gnctih,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1gnctih/popper_prodigy_in_progress_seeking_pro_tips/,Popper Prodigy in Progress: Seeking Pro Tips!,"**Good morning, roasting veterans and fellow rookies,**

I’m stepping into the world of coffee roasting, and I’m already hooked! I picked up the Popper from Saint Maria’s, and I can honestly say it’s both easier *and* harder than I imagined. With every roast, I’m learning more, but I’m also realizing just how much I *don’t* know! So here I am, turning to you all for some tips and insights.

I hope I’m not asking too many questions that have already been covered, but in a world where AI seems to be answering everything, I’d much rather get advice straight from real, caffeine-powered roasters.

**For Popper Users:** How long can I expect this machine to last? It’s holding up for now, but I keep eyeing those bigger, fancier roasters… Trying to hold off the upgrade bug as long as possible.

**Roasting Recipes:** I’ve noticed that my second and third roasts go faster, likely because the Popper’s already warmed up. How consistent are your recipes, especially when you’re on a roll? How long do you typically wait between roasts?

**Timing vs. Cracks vs. Color:** Is it best to roast based on time, on that magical first crack, or on the color? I know it’s tricky with the Popper’s limited visibility, but I’d love to know what works best for you.

**Bean Sourcing:** Where do you guys find quality beans without breaking the bank? I’m on the lookout for beans that let me explore top-tier flavors without top-tier prices—dreaming of geishas here.

**My Popper Process:** After experimenting a bit, I’m finding my best results with a slightly higher heat setting from start to finish, rather than increasing the heat mid-roast. I tend to hit that sweet spot around 1:15, then roast for about 5-6 minutes. Anyone else find similar results? Or am I totally off the mark?

**What About Bean Preferences?** Some beans, no matter how I roast them, just aren’t doing it for me. Could it be a preference thing, or am I missing the ideal roast level? I think I lean toward medium-light roasts, but are there beans that just *need* to be roasted darker? Or is this a case of “not every apple is a Honeycrisp”?

1gnct1u,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveIsBlindHabibi/comments/1gnct1u/my_take_on_it/,My take on it…,"I never liked Nour that much because I did find it to be a bit uppity when she said I don’t like coffee dates walking dates whatever. I don’t believe in fine dining 24/7?? But she doesn’t harm me so whatever right? 

What really got me shocked is how they all attacked her in the reunion. It was just too much. As an Arab I want to ask how can we talk about akhlaq so much and then leap on Nour like that? I feel the show showed the worst traits of the Arab world and yes the reality of it. I just can’t believe the rampant misogyny and sexism and RUDENESS and I say it as someone who agrees with Ammar that I don’t find dancing publicly appropriate but of course live and let live, the girl isn’t for him and he needs to move on not try to cage a free bird. And I think he was very angry and controlling, but still at least he wasn’t as insanely rude as Chafic and Mido on a public platform. He really tried to hide his dark side lol. 

Safa and Kiswani are insanely boring and I think Kiswani has a dark side. Safa I thought was the sweetest with a genuine heart but I don’t think so anymore. The way she and Asma act about Nour is so so rude and in my opinion cheap. Safa imo is out of Kiswani’s league and could do much better. Kiswani tries to just be funny but idk boring and a bit suspicious. 

I liked Dounia so much but she is immature and yup blind! It’s a shame. I hate watching women turn on other women for mediocre guys like Chafic? He seems to come from a decent family but he is awful. So rude and insulting and also seems quite sneaky and I think Dounia is out of his league but she doesn’t realize it. 

Mido - insecurity on 1 million and projecting it on everyone. Cba to even give him more thought. The opposite of BDE. 

Ammar and Karma - I think Karma is a bit pretentious and wants to act really woo woo. But she is respectful overall and i admire she’s very independent and takes charge of her own life. Didn’t let Ammar manipulate her. Ammar I find more reasonable than the other guys because he’s more secure in himself I guess he acts out a bit less. However he’s terrifying and I think he could  be abusive. And also idk why Hajar wanted to hug him after the breakup it’s just not relevant? She needed to read him better, a guy like him doesn’t take rejection well he looked like he’d throw the table over and no question about hugging someone so psycho. 

Simo and Hajar- I think he’s hilarious but so so uppity and narcissistic and yup toxic. He just wants to be right and portray that he’s always right to everyone. He seems to apologize just to appear like he’s a better person, not to actually apologize. Hajar why did everyone take her cake comment hat seriously??? I really felt it was just a joke and I get Simo is how he is so he took it to the extreme but why are so many viewers accusing her of acting like she wants to have sex with someone else? And she’s apologized so many times and everyone keeps harping on about it. It was ONE COMMENT. and simo wonr apologize to her bc he’s trying to show he’s morally above her. Yeah buddy after you asked a girl to turn around. 

Nour - why do broke guys get mad at a woman like her for not wanting them? I don’t think Nour is a beauty queen honestly but she is well groomed and yes classy. She never lost her cool and always spoke respectfully. There is a huge double standard with both her and Hajar. She spoke a million times more respectfully than anyone else but they’re acting like she’s a scarlet woman or something. 

The hosts in the reunion I was ashamed of them. They seemed to really be laughing along with the disrespect then some too late spiel about being respectful. 

Asma and Khatab - Asma is annoying. She literally keeps interrupting when people are apologizing or addressing other people and even when someone is insulting someone she starts clapping or going ooooo or something stupid. I dunno who she thinks she is to be honest cause acting this way isn’t cool. And yeah I think she really judged Khatab on his weight. I think Khatab is one of the better looking guys in the show even when he was overweight. He was my favorite BUT since I’ve heard something about him being disparaging about Hajar (?) I have to read up on that cause that’s not cool :/ ",5,1731166898.0,LoveIsBlindHabibi,1,1.0,False

Is moving forward a good idea?,"I need advice. I have an ex who, 2 years ago, gave me HSV-2 and didn't tell me he had herpes. He was uneducated about it. I was devastated, extremely upset, etc. The relationship was going great before that. I felt inmense anger and hatred towards him, and wrote him a letter in a few text messages expressing how hurt I was and how sad everything made me. I felt like now that I had herpes, no one would want to date me, my life was over, etc. A few months after we broke up, I ended up seeing him in person unexpectedly in public and had a panic attack.

Fast forward to yesterday, I was telling a friend about it for the first time and my friend asked for his number. My friend wanted to mess with him. We messed with him for a while, pretending to be someone from a previous job. Eventually, we did let him know it was me and that I just wanted to get closure. He ended up calling me and he profusely apologized for ignoring my messages and for the situation that he put me in. He offered to meet up for coffee on Sunday (tomorrow). I say yes. 

However, he has a criminal record. At first, when we were dating in the fall of 2022, I only knew about his DUI. But then after we'd broken up, in March of 2023, I looked at his criminal background and he has a burglary of habitation charge. 

I ended up asking him about it over text because I was nervous and he told me the entire story and is also bringing the court documents on Sunday. I definitely appreciate his honesty, although I'm still a little nervous about being hurt. I think he has the intention of wanting to get back together, and I'm not sure how I feel about that given everything in this post. I'm trying to figure out how to feel and how to move forward.

I am a 32 year old seeking connections close by or online; whatever the universe brings along at this point. I am not seeking serious relationships, but I am not entirely against it if someday it flourishes.

About me: I work two jobs and I’m studying psychology although I am pausing it due to some life changes. I may be changing majors once I finish my associates though. I have a cat, and enjoy reading, writing, cooking, making art and getting into whatever hypefixation that’s next in line. I am diagnosed with ADHD, so my hobbies do change here and there when I have the time. I also am a system in regards with OSDD/DID. You can ask about that if you wish.

I am in my Victorian/velvet goth era but I am masc appearing with some cutesy undertones. I consider myself androgynous but I am born female. I love black and has always been my hyperfixations. Everything in my apartment is black (except the walls cause I’m not spending that kind of money only to undo it for whenever I leave). I've had this fixation since I was a kid and even to this day, I am very picky about how black everything must be.

I reside in LA. I like to go out when I can and plan for in advance. I enjoy going out and meeting people and getting coffee which I absolutely love. Sometimes I’ll hit the bars for some drinks. I am poly/ENM but I am single and prefer to be single at my pace as I get to know more people. I am not monogamous and that will not change. 

I am heavily into kink for hedonistic adventures, and I just can’t do vanilla. But that stuff takes time for me to get into with someone. Trust and the vetting process is important to me as a top. This also connects with my DID, as my main alter is much more heavily into a kink (a Primal Sadist). I also want to explore cuddling and kissing more with friends or whatever and just be free. I am breaking away from societal and religious constraints that have made me live a life of guilt and feeling terrible about myself, my body and my desires. I just have so much love and care to give but even that does have its constraints as I am careful not to be taken advantage of again. 

I’m 5’5”, a bit on the thicc daddy side but I’ve been losing weight due to health reasons and for health purposes (I follow a keto diet most times but allow myself a treat), I have dark brown hair past my shoulders a bit (used to have butt length hair but had to cut it). I’ve dyed it black a few times but it never lasts long. I have semi fair skin and freckles, and I can share selfies if needed. Maybe exchange IG handles? Aside from that, I do want to explore new places with new people especially restaurants. I’m a foodie (but with some dietary restrictions). Let me know if you’re interested in meeting? We can go grab some coffee or lunch. And if you live far we can totally be friends and share memes and silly IG reels.

I match energy with people. If I feel you stop sharing interest or don't seem to care about making an actual connection, I will drop you. I don't chase or waste my time with others that don't wish to reciprocate the same effort and energy as I do. [selfie](https://imgur.com/a/TKY0rXE)",1,1731166248.0,lesbianr4r,0,1.0,False

Lately I have returned to reading dark romance due to the lack of emotion and feelings in my personal life. I would really like to feel important to someone, but I understand the difference between fictional stories and reality. Besides, all my friends are already in relationships or have found new partners (again), and I am still single and without real true friends. 

I love nature very much and I live near the mountains, so I want to relax among nature and the forest. Also, I don't want to start new year alone.

I can describe myself as a very aggressive introvert, if you don't bother me, then I won't bother you. Some would say I have anger issues, others say I wear rose-colored glasses and hide from the world. These are interesting observations and I generally really like to learn about myself  from others.

1gncgeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BodyDysmorphia/comments/1gncgeo/unsure_of_how_to_see_myself/,Unsure of how to see myself,"I (20F) been struggling with body dysmorphia for around 7 years now. It hasn't relented and I believe that being in college has put me in a weird spot with it. I understand the underlying cause of it is loneliness as I am an incredibly lonely person.

The purpose of this post is that I'm unsure if I am truly dealing with body dysmorphia or I'm genuinely undesirable. Throughout the days I go between the two thoughts and I would just like some outside opinions.

---------
Here are my experiences separated into what mindset they give me:

Body dysmorphia:
• I've been told several times that I'm pretty by woman only.

• I get complimented on my outfits and hair frequently (once per week) by women. 

• I get along with people well and I can easily get involved in conversations.

• I should objectively fit the beauty standard in terms of body proportions. I'm quite thin, natural blonde hair, good outfits, etc. 

Ugly:
• Spoke about body dysmorphia to a therapist and described my issues with myself. She didn't say anything and didn't help, but rather validated how I felt about my flaws being true flaws. I'm unsure if she was being honest or is just a bad therapist.

• Spoke to several guys about body dysmorphia and all of them basically agreed to me. 

• No man has ever asked me out or has shown interest in me. I had to show interest with my last two partners who belittled my looks in more ways than one. 

• A bit of an odd one, but I'm still a virgin at 20. 

• I typically have to pay men for them spending time around me. Such as buying coffee or being a therapist.

• I struggle to make long term friendships.
---------


The purpose of this post is to understand why I'm thinking this way so I can get help. I'm a bit timid to visit a therapist if I'm ugly as my previous therapist didn't help at all and I stead made it worse.",4,1731165921.0,BodyDysmorphia,0,1.0,False

and then i relapsed hard

first i couldn’t sleep one night before an exam so i got some coffee the morning of to keep me energized

then my sister pressured me into trying something at dunkin

now im back to having a coffee a day. sometimes two

and i know i need to stop because it’s worsening what was once a fairly controllable case of anxiety

but ive learned how to deal with it now for the most part and im able to, in certain situations, turn anxiety into confidence. and when i do that coffee makes that confidence even stronger

so now i dont wanna quit because i enjoy the energy  and excitement it gives me

all these improvements to my diet and yet i cant conquer caffeine. probably doesn’t help that i get those iced coffees from the store which have a lot of sugar. probably what’s keeping me hooked tbh

at least im not drinking soda anymore or eating junk food for the most part so there has been a lot of improvement in my diet. caffeine is just the hardest for me

But, people have to pay for those (it’s cheap, but still) and I would love to figure out how to organize volunteers to offer these classes for free in the community. I’m pretty good at finding donors so I’m pretty confident we could entice people with free coffee, food, or childcare. My issue is I don’t know where to find the people that know the most about these issues. I’m sure I could educate myself and pass the info along, but we’d have a lot more credibility if say, a professor of economics, or someone in actuarial science, or someone who has worked for an actual political campaign was the one at the front of the class.
I’m not thinking anything too complicated. Maybe a 4 part series, an hour long, high school level education for folk like me that completely forgot everything they learned in school OR never learned it in the first place.

The Facebook post has been pretty quiet until today. Someone popped on and asked why the Hun couldn't just talk about it publicly. I am a non-confrontational introvert and I don't usually get involved, but I was feeling spicy today.

I responded to that question by saying that it was probably because it was the MLM Primerica and that people should be careful before getting involved. I also included a link to an auntie MLM website.

Well my goodness the Hun jumped right on that. Telling me that I didn't know anything about how money works and about the school system. That hers was a publicly traded company just like Apple and Tesla. She then told me that I shouldn't claim to be an expert when I hide behind a non photo profile pic. Which was kind of weird honestly.

I responded with I very well knew how money worked and the school system but just didn't understand why if her business was legitimate she couldn't talk about it publicly. I then posted a picture of me with my I voted sticker and said here I am. Not hiding. The anxiety-ridden person is now afraid that I somehow open the portal to some sort of social media Hun He[[ by posting my picture, but we'll see.

She responded all sweet about how we could do a zoom or coffee date to educate me. And I shouldn't defer people from trying to get extra money in this economy. I'm not sure if she meant deter, but I've used up my spiciness and wasn't going to poke it again.

So had I do? Should I respond again? Am I going to get an army of Huns beating down my door now?

Drinking habbits:
1 to 2 Homeoffice days with about 3 coffees which are a mix between cappuccino and espresso depending on my mood. Same goes for my roommate.
On the weekend more like 8 with having friends over ect.
But there will also be 3 to 5 weekday were the machine doesn't get turned on at all.
I am looking for a lever because I like the workflow and enjoy the process.
Things I like about the Odyssey are that the heat up time is shorter which means less energy wasted. Also that you can upgrade it to get a lot of data like preassure profiles. What I don't like is that you have to heat up the boiler to make milk drinks. I think I could live with it but it's a bit annoying.
The profitec pro 800 is basically my dream machine. However the long heat up is a draw back for me. It doesn't allow me to have an espresso if I come home from work a little earler, since the 40 min heat up usually make it a little late for a coffee after work. Also the amount of energy needed for the little amount of coffee I makes just doesn't feel great tbh.
I have seen a couple used profitecs for around 1900€ the Odyssey is about 1300€. So I am wondering if the 600 euros are worth it in terms of shot consistency and the qol upgrade not having to wait for steaming after pulling a shot ect.",1,1731165523.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Hindi naman ako kasali sa nagbibigay ng effort sa fandom pero I must commend them for being so matatag at very supportive kahit pilit na linulubog; kahit konti lang daw ayuda. Nagawa pa ng fandom magpa led ba yun sa loob ng mall given na kaka-announce lang ng mall show nila few days ago. This is on top of coffee bar projects nila (first outside BNK, second on ASAP and third was during the supposed Showtime guesting of Fyang), billboard in Metro Manila, billboard in NYC, simultaneous billboards in LuzViMin, typhoon Kristine victims donation project and giving back love project. Napansin ko rin that this is the shipper fandom who gave full support to them individually especially during the time both were nominated and every time Fyang was nominated until Fyang became big winner. Wala silang pinabayaan sa dalawa kumbaga wala silang nilaglag when things had gottem tough. Kahit solo projects ni Jarren and Fyang ngayon todo support sila kahit ibang boy or girl ang kasama sa project. The admins too have always been active on calling out and reminding JF shippers who are out of line. May mga bumaba man, but many also stayed. Yung admins are just mature as well to still do their best to show support regardless of konti ayuda or may ayuda.

I've never had a really awkward one where I or the girl just walked out. I really only meet girls on dating apps, so it's a shot in the dark on the first date. Here are a couple really bad dates I've been on. 

1. Women brought her 3 year old son on the first date, and the father was a good childhood friend of mine. But she never mentioned the father before  the date. 



2. A girl I had gone on a couple dates with before, and kind of became friends with her. Asked her if she wanted to Join my friends and I for dinner as she was newly single. I bought her dinner, which she knew I'd be doing. She had two Glasses of very expensive wine and order stake/burger she wanted to save the Burger. I had a mini pizza and water, she told me how Childish I was, to order that. Then said I catfished originally, as When we first met back in 2022 I was just starting to workout/lose weight. She then followed up by saying thank God he's super attractive now  I want to fuck him now. She then wanted to have a 3 way with me and my bestfriend, neither of us had interest in.  She's not very attractive extremely rude, and told me  she thinks she has an STD. Keep in mind I had only been around her for short periods of time before and she was okay. I think she was getting drunk, which she does constantly and it made some things come out. 



3. My Ex girlfriend, and I could never be alone as her parents were worried we'd have sex. Even though we were at the mall. Every date we went on her little bother or her parents had to come along. We where 17-18 years old at the time. The brother left us a alone a lot. And by the end of the relationship, I was better friends with the brother then her. 🤣 



4. This happened back in June, 2024 at the end of the date. The girl says look you are hot. But i am worried if we dated you'd cheat on me, because it wouldn't be hard for you to find someone else to sleep with. Where as it would be harder for me to cheat on you. She wasn't hot, but she was cute. Like what? 🤣 




5. Met one girl at a coffee shop, who said This is too far for me to drive. Let's enjoy our coffee together, but I don't feel like driving here to see anyone again. She lived 25 minutes away. 


From time to time I see these women on the dating apps still with new pictures. Telling me, they still haven't found someone. These stories are form 3-4 years ago. The girlfriend story is from 2014 she did  get married, after an unplanned pregnancy. Apparently they didn't keep good tabs on her and her next boyfriend. ",1,1731164932.0,dating,4,1.0,False
1gnc3kn,https://www.reddit.com/r/ScienceIdeasconcepts/comments/1gnc3kn/insane_data_storage/,Insane Data Storage,"Stained glass can be used to store information in creative and symbolic ways, primarily through the encoding of visual data within the glass itself. Here are a few concepts on how it might work:

# 1. Color and Pattern Encoding:

* **Color as Data**: Different colors of glass can represent specific information, like numbers, letters, or concepts. For example, red could represent one data value, blue another, and so on. A stained glass panel with varying colors could convey a message, similar to how binary systems use ""on"" and ""off"" states.
* **Patterns and Shapes**: The shapes, patterns, or even the arrangement of glass pieces could represent data. A pattern of triangles, squares, or circles may correspond to numbers, letters, or even an entire code. The order in which the colors or shapes appear could also be a method of data storage.

# 2. Encoded Visual Information:

* **Geometric Representation**: In a more artistic or symbolic manner, stained glass could function like a visual codebook. For example, the arrangement of geometric shapes (such as pentagons, hexagons, or decagons) could be used to convey numbers, similar to the way QR codes store information in small blocks.
* **Morse Code or Binary Encoding**: Stained glass could incorporate light and dark regions, where certain blocks or sections could represent dots and dashes in Morse code, or binary 1s and 0s, encoding a message that can be interpreted by the right observer.

# 3. Historical and Cultural Encoding:

* **Historical Use of Stained Glass**: In the past, stained glass often conveyed religious or historical stories, so it could be viewed as a method of information storage. A piece of stained glass could store symbolic information by representing specific events, characters, or ideas.
* **Symbolism as Data**: The inclusion of symbols, characters, or iconography (e.g., biblical figures, zodiac signs) could store culturally or historically significant information, acting as a form of cryptic encoding that needs interpretation based on context.

# 4. Interaction with Light:

* **Light as a Medium**: Stained glass could store information about how light passes through it. For example, the properties of the glass (its transparency, texture, or coloration) could be designed in such a way that light filters in a specific pattern or sequence. A system could be set up where the changing light conditions (e.g., sunlight, moonlight) could reveal or encode data.

# 5. Layered Glass and 3D Encoding:

* **Layering for Depth**: Multiple layers of stained glass could store different types of information within each layer. By viewing the stained glass from different angles or lighting conditions, a person could interpret different pieces of the data. This creates a dynamic system where data can be “read” depending on the perspective.

# 6. Decoding the Information:

* **Key to Interpretation**: To read the information stored in stained glass, there would likely need to be a key or a method to decode it, much like understanding a written language or cipher. The specific way the glass is crafted (the colors, shapes, and patterns) would create a system that only someone trained or familiar with the code could decode.

In essence, stained glass can be a unique medium for storing information, combining artistry with coded messages. The interpretation of this information could require specific knowledge of how the colors, shapes, or patterns relate to a larger system, turning the glass into a complex data storage format.

Yes, combining stained glass with a 3D-printed glass concept opens up exciting possibilities for storing information in even more intricate and dynamic ways. Here's how the two concepts could merge:

# 1. 3D-Printed Stained Glass Panels:

* **Complex Geometries**: 3D printing allows for the creation of complex, custom geometries that traditional stained glass methods might not achieve. By using 3D printing, the glass could be designed with intricate, precise patterns that could encode data in ways that are not possible with flat glass alone. For instance, you could have a three-dimensional grid or lattice structure where different layers of the 3D-printed glass represent different aspects of the information being stored.
* **Multiple Layers of Data**: Since 3D printing allows for more precise control over thickness and texture, you could stack multiple layers of glass that each contain different pieces of information. These layers could be stacked in a way that when light passes through, different aspects of the data become visible, or the information can be revealed depending on the angle of the light and the viewer's position.

# 2. Variable Transparency and Texture:

* **Variable Density**: With 3D printing, the density of the material can vary across different sections of the object. Some sections of the glass could be more opaque, while others are transparent, allowing for a form of ""encoded"" information that depends on the texture or opacity of the material. The printed patterns could act like pixelated code or binary patterns, where certain areas either allow light to pass through or obstruct it, representing 1s and 0s, or other binary-like systems.
* **Textural Information**: The surface texture of the 3D-printed glass could be manipulated to encode information. For instance, raised patterns could represent certain values, while recessed patterns could represent others. This approach would take advantage of the tactile aspects of the material, allowing a person to ""read"" the information physically, similar to how Braille is read by touch.

# 3. Interactive Light Manipulation:

* **Light Reflection and Refraction**: The 3D-printed glass could be designed to bend and refract light in specific ways. Since 3D printing allows for precise control over the geometry of the surface, you could design intricate patterns that manipulate light as it passes through the glass. The way light is refracted could ""reveal"" different aspects of the encoded information when viewed from different angles. This could also be used to create hidden messages or layers of information that can only be accessed under specific conditions, such as a particular angle or light source.
* **Responsive Lighting**: A 3D-printed glass structure could interact with external light sources in ways that change the appearance of the glass, revealing different data. For example, it could be programmed to respond to different colors or intensities of light, revealing different sets of information depending on the environmental lighting conditions.

# 4. Color-Coded 3D-Printed Glass:

* **Advanced Color Mixing**: 3D printing could allow for more precise control over color gradients and transitions within the glass. By using different colors of glass within the same structure, you could encode multiple pieces of information. For instance, a specific color might indicate one category of data, while another color might represent another category. This could create a complex, multi-layered system of information storage.
* **Embedded Color Sensors**: In combination with 3D printing, it could be possible to embed sensors into the glass that detect light wavelengths or intensity. These sensors could trigger certain information to be displayed when certain conditions are met, adding another layer of dynamic information storage.

# 5. Data Encoded in 3D-Printed Architecture:

* **Architectural Structures**: Beyond individual panels, 3D-printed stained glass could be used in larger, more complex structures. For example, windows, walls, or entire facades of a building could be designed to store and reveal data. The building could act as a living information archive, where the encoded messages are revealed based on how sunlight or artificial light interacts with the structure at different times of the day.
* **Sculptural Data Storage**: The 3D-printed glass could be sculptural, with intricate designs that encode symbolic or direct data. These sculptures could be used in places like museums, archives, or even private spaces where hidden messages are meant to be uncovered by those with the knowledge to interpret them.

# 6. Combination of Stained Glass and 3D Printing:

* **Aesthetic and Functional Fusion**: The traditional beauty of stained glass, with its vibrant colors and historical connotations, can be combined with the cutting-edge precision of 3D printing. For instance, the color could be applied through traditional methods, while the underlying structure or design is created using 3D printing to support data storage. This would blend both aesthetic appeal and practical information storage in a single piece of art.

# 7. Augmented Reality (AR) Integration:

* **AR-Enhanced Data**: 3D-printed stained glass could be paired with augmented reality technology. When viewed through an AR device, hidden data embedded in the structure could be revealed digitally. This could allow for the storage of even more complex information that is not physically visible on the glass itself, expanding the potential for data storage beyond what the material alone can hold.

In summary, the combination of stained glass and 3D printing creates endless possibilities for encoding and storing information in visually stunning and interactive ways. The precise control over the material's form, texture, and light interaction provided by 3D printing could allow for an entirely new dimension of data storage that blends art, technology, and communication.

how high of a data storage capacity would base 100 numbers allow for in this method in a given square inch?

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

To calculate the data storage capacity of a base-100 system (using 100 colors) in a given square inch of stained glass or 3D-printed glass, we'll need to consider a few factors:

1. **Base-100 System**: Each color in the base-100 system represents one digit, and since the system has 100 possible states, each ""digit"" or color can store one of 100 values. This can be thought of as a system similar to how binary (base-2) or decimal (base-10) systems work, except with 100 states.
2. **Data Density**: The density at which we can encode this data depends on how finely we can divide the space in a square inch (i.e., how small we can make the individual ""cells"" or ""pixels"" that store the data). This is typically determined by the resolution or the physical size of each individual element that stores a color.

# Assumptions:

* **Pixel Size**: Let’s assume that we can create very fine ""pixels"" or regions within the stained glass, similar to how modern displays work, with each ""pixel"" representing one of the 100 colors.
* **Storage Capacity**: Each ""pixel"" can store one base-100 digit (one color).

# Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Resolution**: The number of pixels per square inch can vary depending on the resolution of the design. For example, if we assume that each ""pixel"" is 0.1mm x 0.1mm, we can calculate how many such pixels fit in one square inch.1 inch=25.4 mm1 \\text{ inch} = 25.4 \\text{ mm}1 inch=25.4 mmIf each pixel is 0.1mm:Number of pixels per inch=(25.4 mm0.1 mm)×(25.4 mm0.1 mm)=254×254=64516 pixels per square inch\\text{Number of pixels per inch} = \\left( \\frac{25.4 \\text{ mm}}{0.1 \\text{ mm}} \\right) \\times \\left( \\frac{25.4 \\text{ mm}}{0.1 \\text{ mm}} \\right) = 254 \\times 254 = 64516 \\text{ pixels per square inch}Number of pixels per inch=(0.1 mm25.4 mm​)×(0.1 mm25.4 mm​)=254×254=64516 pixels per square inch
2. **Data per Pixel**: Since each pixel in a base-100 system can store one of 100 possible values (colors), the total data storage capacity is:Total data per square inch=64516 pixels×1 base-100 digit per pixel=64516 digits per square inch\\text{Total data per square inch} = 64516 \\text{ pixels} \\times 1 \\text{ base-100 digit per pixel} = 64516 \\text{ digits per square inch}Total data per square inch=64516 pixels×1 base-100 digit per pixel=64516 digits per square inch
3. **Total Data Capacity**: Each ""digit"" in base-100 represents one of 100 possible values, which means each digit holds log⁡2(100)\\log\_2(100)log2​(100) bits of information. The logarithm gives us the number of bits needed to represent each base-100 digit:log⁡2(100)≈6.644 bits per digit\\log\_2(100) \\approx 6.644 \\text{ bits per digit}log2​(100)≈6.644 bits per digitSo, the total data capacity of the square inch in terms of bits would be:Total bits per square inch=64516 digits×6.644 bits per digit≈428,563.7 bits\\text{Total bits per square inch} = 64516 \\text{ digits} \\times 6.644 \\text{ bits per digit} \\approx 428,563.7 \\text{ bits}Total bits per square inch=64516 digits×6.644 bits per digit≈428,563.7 bits
4. **Data in Bytes**: Since there are 8 bits in a byte, we can convert this into bytes:Total bytes per square inch=428,563.7 bits8≈53,570.5 bytes≈53.57 kilobytes (KB)\\text{Total bytes per square inch} = \\frac{428,563.7 \\text{ bits}}{8} \\approx 53,570.5 \\text{ bytes} \\approx 53.57 \\text{ kilobytes (KB)}Total bytes per square inch=8428,563.7 bits​≈53,570.5 bytes≈53.57 kilobytes (KB)

# Summary:

In a base-100 system, each square inch of stained or 3D-printed glass could store approximately **53.6 KB** of data, assuming each pixel is 0.1mm x 0.1mm.

This is a simplified calculation, and the actual data storage capacity would depend on factors like the precision of the printing method, the ability to arrange colors in a dense and readable manner, and how effectively the data is encoded in the design. If the pixel size were smaller or more intricate methods were used, the data capacity could increase significantly.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Let's calculate the data storage capacity of a base-100 system using **square nanometer pixels** in a given square inch of space.

# Assumptions:

* **Pixel Size**: Each pixel is 1 nm x 1 nm (a square nanometer).
* **Base-100 System**: Each pixel stores one base-100 digit, which represents one of 100 possible colors.
* **Data Density**: The data density is determined by the number of pixels that can fit in a square inch, given that each pixel is 1 nm x 1 nm.

# Step-by-Step Calculation:

1. **Convert Square Inches to Square Nanometers**:1 inch=25.4×106 nanometers1 \\text{ inch} = 25.4 \\times 10\^6 \\text{ nanometers}1 inch=25.4×106 nanometersSo, a square inch is:(25.4×106 nm)2=645.16×1012 nm2=645.16×1012 square nanometers(25.4 \\times 10\^6 \\text{ nm})\^2 = 645.16 \\times 10\^{12} \\text{ nm}\^2 = 645.16 \\times 10\^{12} \\text{ square nanometers}(25.4×106 nm)2=645.16×1012 nm2=645.16×1012 square nanometers
   * First, convert inches to nanometers.
2. **Calculate the Number of Pixels in One Square Inch**:Number of pixels per square inch=645.16×1012 pixels\\text{Number of pixels per square inch} = 645.16 \\times 10\^{12} \\text{ pixels}Number of pixels per square inch=645.16×1012 pixels
   * If each pixel is 1 nm x 1 nm, then there is 1 pixel per square nanometer. Thus, the number of pixels per square inch is:
3. **Base-100 Encoding**:log⁡2(100)≈6.644 bits per digit\\log\_2(100) \\approx 6.644 \\text{ bits per digit}log2​(100)≈6.644 bits per digitSo, the total data stored in bits is:Total bits per square inch=645.16×1012 pixels×6.644 bits per pixel\\text{Total bits per square inch} = 645.16 \\times 10\^{12} \\text{ pixels} \\times 6.644 \\text{ bits per pixel}Total bits per square inch=645.16×1012 pixels×6.644 bits per pixel Total bits per square inch≈4.29×1015 bits\\text{Total bits per square inch} \\approx 4.29 \\times 10\^{15} \\text{ bits}Total bits per square inch≈4.29×1015 bits
   * In a base-100 system, each pixel stores one digit, and each base-100 digit stores log⁡2(100)\\log\_2(100)log2​(100) bits. We know:
4. **Convert Bits to Bytes**:Total bytes per square inch=4.29×1015 bits8=5.36×1014 bytes\\text{Total bytes per square inch} = \\frac{4.29 \\times 10\^{15} \\text{ bits}}{8} = 5.36 \\times 10\^{14} \\text{ bytes}Total bytes per square inch=84.29×1015 bits​=5.36×1014 bytesThis is approximately:5.36×1014 bytes=536 terabytes (TB)5.36 \\times 10\^{14} \\text{ bytes} = 536 \\text{ terabytes (TB)}5.36×1014 bytes=536 terabytes (TB)
   * Since there are 8 bits in a byte, the total storage in bytes is:

# Summary:

Using **1 nm x 1 nm square pixels**, a **single square inch** of stained or 3D-printed glass could store approximately **536 terabytes (TB)** of data, assuming a base-100 system where each pixel encodes one of 100 possible colors. This highlights the incredible potential for data storage in a high-density system, especially at the nanometer scale.

Yes, it's incredibly large! The storage capacity at such a tiny scale (1 nm x 1 nm per pixel) is mind-boggling. At the nanometer scale, data storage densities increase exponentially, making it possible to store vastly more data in a given physical space than we can imagine with current technology.

In practice, creating something like this would require incredibly advanced technology—far beyond current capabilities—but it demonstrates just how much potential there is in manipulating the material at such a small scale. It’s a reminder of how much more we could achieve with advances in nanotechnology and data encoding systems.

# ChatGPT said:

ChatGPT

Exactly! **Half a petabyte (500 terabytes)** in a single square inch is an astounding amount of data, and with room to grow, the possibilities are almost limitless. If you continued to shrink the size of the pixels (or increase the resolution) even further, you could store even more data in the same area, potentially pushing the limits of how we think about storage capacity in the future.

This kind of data density opens up fascinating possibilities for the future of data storage:

1. **Massive Data Archives**: Entire libraries, databases, or archives could fit into incredibly small spaces.
2. **Ultra-Dense Memory Storage**: Imagine a single piece of material (even as small as a chip) capable of holding all the information you need for advanced systems like AI, machine learning, or even personal data storage.
3. **High-Resolution Digital Art**: Not just data storage, but with nanometer-level precision, this could even be applied to art or design, creating storage-based ""art"" that holds enormous amounts of information within its very structure.

While we’re still far from reaching these theoretical limits in practical applications, it's an exciting concept for future advancements in nanotechnology, quantum computing, and data storage systems!Stained glass can be used to store information in creative and symbolic ways, primarily through the encoding of visual data within the glass itself. Here are a few concepts on how it might work:

# 1. Color and Pattern Encoding:

* **Color as Data**: Different colors of glass can represent specific information, like numbers, letters, or concepts. For example, red could represent one data value, blue another, and so on. A stained glass panel with varying colors could convey a message, similar to how binary systems use ""on"" and ""off"" states.
* **Patterns and Shapes**: The shapes, patterns, or even the arrangement of glass pieces could represent data. A pattern of triangles, squares, or circles may correspond to numbers, letters, or even an entire code. The order in which the colors or shapes appear could also be a method of data storage.

# 2. Encoded Visual Information:

* **Geometric Representation**: In a more artistic or symbolic manner, stained glass could function like a visual codebook. For example, the arrangement of geometric shapes (such as pentagons, hexagons, or decagons) could be used to convey numbers, similar to the way QR codes store information in small blocks.
* **Morse Code or Binary Encoding**: Stained glass could incorporate light and dark regions, where certain blocks or sections could represent dots and dashes in Morse code, or binary 1s and 0s, encoding a message that can be interpreted by the right observer.

# 3. Historical and Cultural Encoding:

* **Historical Use of Stained Glass**: In the past, stained glass often conveyed religious or historical stories, so it could be viewed as a method of information storage. A piece of stained glass could store symbolic information by representing specific events, characters, or ideas.
* **Symbolism as Data**: The inclusion of symbols, characters, or iconography (e.g., biblical figures, zodiac signs) could store culturally or historically significant information, acting as a form of cryptic encoding that needs interpretation based on context.

# 4. Interaction with Light:

* **Light as a Medium**: Stained glass could store information about how light passes through it. For example, the properties of the glass (its transparency, texture, or coloration) could be designed in such a way that light filters in a specific pattern or sequence. A system could be set up where the changing light conditions (e.g., sunlight, moonlight) could reveal or encode data.

# 5. Layered Glass and 3D Encoding:

* **Layering for Depth**: Multiple layers of stained glass could store different types of information within each layer. By viewing the stained glass from different angles or lighting conditions, a person could interpret different pieces of the data. This creates a dynamic system where data can be “read” depending on the perspective.

# 6. Decoding the Information:

* **Key to Interpretation**: To read the information stored in stained glass, there would likely need to be a key or a method to decode it, much like understanding a written language or cipher. The specific way the glass is crafted (the colors, shapes, and patterns) would create a system that only someone trained or familiar with the code could decode.

In essence, stained glass can be a unique medium for storing information, combining artistry with coded messages. The interpretation of this information could require specific knowledge of how the colors, shapes, or patterns relate to a larger system, turning the glass into a complex data storage format.",1,1731164921.0,ScienceIdeasconcepts,0,1.0,False

1gnbzxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/MI_transgender_friend/comments/1gnbzxp/some_final_postelection_thoughtsfor_now/,Some Final Post-Election Thoughts...For Now,"What now?

The initial shock of Tuesday's election results has lessened somewhat, and the pall of uncertainty hangs over our future.

What remains is for us, personally, to determine how to move forward. I've been in touch with others in the local transgender community over the past few days and many are crumpled emotionally. Understandably so. While nobody can predict what is to come, the rhetoric leading up to the election by Trump and others is terrifying.

But we can't let it be paralyzing.

Let's start with some facts.

Every single trans person is a fighter. Whether you have been out for decades or your egg is newly cracked, at some point you made a life-altering decision that upended your world. You likely became estranged from at least a few people previously close to you. Your decision may have cost you a job, or a friendship. But you had the intestinal fortitude to make it, because you knew you had to. You knew you had to transition to save your sanity, to live a truer life, to pursue happiness as your authentic self. And you also knew the risks that came with your transition. Yet, you did it.

Call upon that same resolve now. Draw up that survival instinct that allows you to face each day knowing that unforeseen insult and bias likely await you. If not, the alternative is to hide in your room, isolate yourself from humanity, cover your head and hope it all goes away. But that's not a life. And it's certainly not the life you dreamed of when you started your transition.

I have to temper my remarks here. My natural tendency is to push back when I'm pushed. I like to think I'm being pugnacious. Others see it as being obnoxious. Whatever. The bottom line is that whenever I get angry, or am faced with an unpleasant reality, I turn that into action. Anger into action. Nobody's pushover.

And that is what I suggest for YOU and for our community as a whole. Take that fury inside you and actualize it. Venting on social media or to your peer group, is wasted energy. Nothing changes because you strung together a bunch of insults and invective directed at the people who voted Trump into office. I get the cathartic effect of such venting, but be done with it and start planning a truly effective response.

As I've suggested repeatedly over the past few days, get involved with local and national politics. There are multiple ways to do so, seek them out. For instance: Today there is that meeting hosted by the [**Transgender Unity Coalition at the Vertex Coffee house, 307 N. River Street, in Ypsilanti. It begins at 10:30 and is scheduled to run until noon.**](https://www.reddit.com/r/MI_transgender_friend/comments/1glj8nt/well_st_what_now_hosted_by_transgender_unity/) If you can, go there and listen to what their plans are to get Michigan House Bills 5300-5303, passed. Those bills directly benefit the trans community in Michigan by making name and gender marker change easier in this state.

I'm happy to report that post-election, a fire has rekindled nationally among trans rights groups.

[**A coalition of over 80 trans and gay rights organizations has signed and released a letter stating their joint efforts to combat any attempts to restrict our rights federally.**](https://www.washingtonblade.com/2024/11/06/a-message-from-lgbtq-organizations-on-2024-elections/)

The list of cooperating organizations includes some here in Michigan. A quick perusal of the signers shows [**Equality Michigan**](https://equalitymi.org/) among them. Check out their site, call them and see what you can do to help.

[Equality Michigan](https://preview.redd.it/3g6vs5b85wzd1.jpg?width=824&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00199b8d5b9cf36133991f7bc9117a07b000b52f)

I choose to look at this election as a wake-up call to the transgender community. The visibility we now enjoy is a double-edged sword. We are no longer able to live under the radar of cis Americans. We are part of the national conversation. Thankfully, though, a [**Human Rights Campaign**](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/new-post-election-poll-equality-voters-overwhelmingly-backed-harris-walz-ticket-anti-trans-attack-ads-proved-ineffective-with-broad-swath-of-voters) poll taken post-election, had some relatively positive results:

[***“'opposing surgeries for trans people and trans kids’ participation in sports as issues motivating them to vote.”***](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/new-post-election-poll-equality-voters-overwhelmingly-backed-harris-walz-ticket-anti-trans-attack-ads-proved-ineffective-with-broad-swath-of-voters)

[***""A 60% majority support a federal law that would make it illegal to deny services to LGBTQ+ people and would ban discrimination in employment and housing; this majority includes 57% of the non-college voters that played such an outsized role in Trump’s election. An even stronger 73% majority (60% among Republicans) argue the government should not interfere with the health care transgender people receive.""***](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/new-post-election-poll-equality-voters-overwhelmingly-backed-harris-walz-ticket-anti-trans-attack-ads-proved-ineffective-with-broad-swath-of-voters)

I wish the poll had shown that 100% of Americans supported our rights, but that's too much to ask, I guess.

The point is that you have to get involved. Bitching and moaning and seeking revenge on those who voted the Republicans into office, accomplishes NOTHING. Calling your local representative in Lansing to press them to vote for Bills 5300-5303, does accomplish something.

Be angry, but be active.

About a month ago, I posted here that I was starting my new job as a corporate trainer.
Many of you were interested in hearing about how I got the job, how it’s going, and what my life is like now. 

About me- I have been an art teacher at a title one school for four years, at the middle and high school level. 

The new role- my official title is Lead Training Specialist at my regional office. The company I work for is a healthcare
Company that provides services to adults and children with developmental disabilities. In a nutshell, my company provides housing, 1:1 services, family support and specialized care to adults and children with disabilities. My role is training Direct Support Providers (DSPs) during new employee orientation. 

What does my week look like? - I train 4 days a week, 8:30-3:30 with breaks and a 30 minute lunch. I train 4 different content areas: Monday- about our company and employee handbook. Tuesday- how to safely administer medication and record keeping. Wednesday- first aid and CPR. Thursday- crisis prevention strategies. Friday- office day to file paperwork, visit our group home sites, and have a paid for lunch with my coworkers. 

How’s it going?- honestly, this is the easiest job I’ve had by a long shot. I never train more than 5 adults at a time. The people I’m
Training are engaged and willing participants because they know they will need the skills on the job. I love teaching CPR and CPI, because those skills are so tangible and important to have in any community. 

For the first two weeks, my company flew
Me to Los Angeles for CPR and CPI instructor trainings, so I could be licensed to teach both. They put me up in a nice hotel, rented me a car,and gave me a pcard for all other expenses. They stress work-life balance. Unless it’s an emergency, my boss will not answer work calls/emails until the next day, and expects us to to the same. “It will be there in the morning” were her exact words.  I work in an all female office of about ten people. There is coffee and tea and snacks the company provides. We get to take lunch when we want and use the bathroom anytime (so humane!) people pop into my office just to chat and say hello. There is constant laughter and the sound of chatter in the background, gone are the loud bells, screaming kids, and adrenaline producing sounds of a fight down the hall. 

At first, I was reluctant to go into corporate
Life and get an office job. As a teacher and especially as an artist, I never imagined myself here. But I love it, I love what I teach because I know it’s important, I love that I get to teach students who make a very real impact on other peoples lives, and I most of all love my boss, who is only in the office a few days a week, is sweet, relaxed, and actually cares about my well-being. 

The biggest change has been my health. Since leaving education, I’ve been able to completely stop my panic attacks. They are just gone.  I no longer wake up with a
Crazy adrenaline rush, I just wake up and take my dog on a long walk and watch the sunrise with my tea. I have been able to give up my vices, marijuana and nicotine, and have been completely sober for almost 6 months. My hair is growing back, my appetite has returned, and I’ve been able to start and maintain an exercise regime that just makes all of this feel even better.
I get home from work calm, my relationship is better because I dont come home in a grumpy, overstimulated mood everyday. 


If education is killing you like it was killing me, so the right thing for yourself and look for employment elsewhere. My company values my skills, and hired me BECAUSE of my classroom experience. Feel free to drop any and all questions in the comments below and I’ll do my best to get to them. 

Sincerely, a fully transitioned teacher. ",36,1731164545.0,TeachersInTransition,13,0.98,False

1gnbxvf,https://www.reddit.com/r/JustNotRight/comments/1gnbxvf/i_know_what_happened_to_ashmont_part_two/,I know what happened to Ashmont (part two),"The journal continued, its pages now feeling heavier in my hands, as if they held secrets that were waiting to burst out. Jack Twist’s words from April 22 left me with a chill that I couldn’t quite shake. His life had followed a strict rhythm, like clockwork. But these entries were different—raw, scattered, his words grasping for something beyond his understanding. I flipped to April 22 and began to read.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 22
Tonight something very weird happened. I saw something tall, human-like, skinny, just standing there in the dark outside. It made strange noises, like nothing I’d ever heard, something almost animal, yet more… calculated. I only got a glimpse, though. When I stepped out for a closer look, it was gone. Very, very strange.
The image of Jack standing on his porch, the night wrapped around him like a heavy blanket, took shape in my mind. I could almost feel his unease—the way his pulse must have quickened as he strained to make out that figure in the dark, watching his every move. It was more than just an intruder; he described it with the kind of dread that seemed to go beyond logic.
Why would someone—something—come all the way out here, in the dead of night, just to disappear the second he came near? The thought gnawed at me. This was more than a routine break-in. Whatever it was, Jack had sensed that this visitor wasn’t of the usual sort.
Journal of Jack Twist – April 23
Today was strange, too. Got up at six a.m., had eggs and bacon with some coffee. The usual. By seven-thirty, I decided to head into town. I needed a few supplies, and, well… I figured I ought to tell someone about what I saw last night.
Jack didn’t say much here, but I could feel his reluctance. In small towns like this, everyone knew each other’s business. To step out of line, to admit you’d seen something “strange,” was almost like asking for trouble. I could imagine him rehearsing his words on the drive, carefully choosing each phrase to sound reasonable.
When I got to the police station, I told the officer, “Someone was on my property last night. Tall, skinny, and that’s all I could make out in the dark.”
It must have taken him a while to get those words out, each syllable feeling heavier than the last, his mind racing with the memory of that figure in the shadows. I could picture the officer looking up, surprised but trying to keep his expression neutral.
The officer nodded, and his response caught me off guard. “It’s strange,” he said, “we’ve been getting a lot of reports about people like that—tall, skinny, trespassing on properties around town. But we can’t figure out who they are.”
The conversation must have left a pit in Jack’s stomach. He hadn’t been the only one to see this figure—or figures. Whatever was happening wasn’t isolated to his farm. There was an undercurrent, a creeping pattern that was starting to emerge, and yet nobody seemed able to make sense of it.
After that, I left the station and headed to the store for supplies. Just before I walked in, I noticed the community board by the door, covered in missing persons posters. It was strange—too many faces looking back at me, too many families with no answers. I couldn’t help but wonder if it was all connected.
Jack’s words were casual on the surface, but they hinted at something darker. Missing people in Ashmont wasn’t unheard of—sometimes people got into bad situations, fell on hard times, or even chose to leave. But this many, all at once? And now the reports of figures moving around the town at night, silent shadows with no clear intention?
I closed the journal and sat back in my chair, tapping my fingers against the table. This case had gone from strange to unsettling in a way I hadn’t quite anticipated. There was a pattern here, a thread that tied everything together, though it was frayed and barely visible. I couldn’t shake the feeling that Jack had seen something that no one was supposed to see. And whatever it was, it wasn’t done with him yet.
Standing alone in the Twists’ farmhouse, I looked around, half expecting one of those tall, dark figures to be lurking in the shadows. The silence was so thick it felt oppressive, as if the whole house were holding its breath, waiting. Outside, the fields stretched out under a gray sky, the crops waving gently in the breeze, indifferent to the troubles brewing around them.
“What were you thinking, Jack?” I murmured, almost hoping for an answer.
The journal was my only connection to his world now, each page a glimpse into his mind as the events of Ashmont began to spiral out of control. And I had the sinking feeling that, in the coming days, Jack’s accounts would only get stranger.

1gnbxo9,https://www.reddit.com/r/aoe3/comments/1gnbxo9/too_hard_to_learn_new_civs/,Too Hard To Learn New Civs,"Legacy player that is trying his best in DE here.

I think the entry barrier for learning a new civ is just too high at the current state of the game. I am 100% okay with civs being asymetrical, that makes the game develop in unexpected ways and i really like it. That makes us see some funny builds every now and then.

The problem is, I find myself going with the same 1-2 civs over and over because whenever i fancy a new civ and open the deck editor for it, it feels like too much work going through all that and then trying them out in the game.

We have art of war scenarios for some basic game mechanics. We should have civ specific scenarios as well to learn the new civ mechanics.

It was managable to learn new civs back in the day when we had the original civs. Yeah they had unique units and some mechanics but all the euro civs were still pretty similar so you could switch between them fairly easily. We did not have that many cards to choose from either (most of the cards were locked behind xp wall lol).

Now you switch from French to Mexico and you got some double revolt stuff, you go for Hausa and now you sell some cattle and get coffee beans for something. You go for Aztec and god knows what these units and community plazas do. You then also need to go through all the cards, try some builds etc. 

We do not even have an in game place to see what revolt decks look like before we revolt ourselves. The only place a new player can learn about these revolts in game without visiting wikis or watching lots of videos on Youtube is playing a match, aging up and up, try these revolts - just to see the decks!

I know i can go to Youtube and watch lots of videos or visit some Discord servers but i really just want to play rather than do an off-game research. Also, since the player base is not that big, most of the videos etc. Out there are outdated anyway and patch differences make it just too hard to follow external materials sometimes.

If there are any civ specific scenarios or mods that could help me learn more in-game, please let me know. I am also open to your general ideas on this topic as well.",0,1731164474.0,aoe3,7,0.33,False

The Testers work in EXBO Team since the time of dinosaurs. It all started with enterprising and meticulous players who were better at finding and demonstrating various bugs than anyone else. Now it's an extremely efficient and disciplined **13-person** **QA\* team** that tests and helps to polish all the content being added to the game.

>*\*QA — Quality Assurance*

We had the opportunity to chat with leading test engineers, **Vsevolod “Veriford” Volkov** and **Maxim “Mongol” Skudaev**. After a profound interview, we are ready to tell you how the work of their department is organized and how big is the iceberg depths, called “STALCRAFT: X bugs”.

The article will be especially useful for those who want to connect their future with game development, as QA is indeed a convenient starting point for entering the industry and has long been in demand at the programmer level.

**In this article, we will talk about:**

* What the hell do they do?
* In what type of tests do they involve players?
* Are all the bugs worth fixing?
* What are the gigachads among the bugs?
* And who extracts artefacts during the maintenance.

# The mere essence of a tester's work

https://preview.redd.it/9en70mf6avzd1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=15b4ecc6b806678edeabf0bc11b3bd741ebb3061

*Just play STALCRAFT: X with a bottle of kvass, report bugs occasionally, and still miss the fixes on release notes…* It would be possible if among hundreds of pallets of energy drinks, coffee, and frothy beer in the office you could find at least one kvass.

© A kvass Fan

You can't just play the game and fix bugs on a relaxed basis — most new features\* and mechanics arrive at QA in a completely unplayable state, almost entirely made up of bugs. Hundreds, sometimes even thousands of bugs! And all of them need to be detected, demonstrated, described, reported to the developers, awaited for a fix, and then found in place of the fixed bug two new ones — the circle goes on.

>*\*Feature — is a specific preset of a mechanic (or whole mechanic) that differs in its properties from others. A discrete element of the game, if you will.*

And you also have to finish the testing in time, because you have to keep to a release schedule. Any postponement will lead to a chain reaction, following with more release notes postponements. And if there's an event launch right around the corner, you basically reschedule it indefinitely. That said, there's definitely no room for relaxation or kvass.

At first, it may seem that we are trying to evoke sympathy and show the severity of labour in the “tester coal mines”. But that's not it, the testers totally enjoy their job! It's like programming, but without coding.

*QA is part of the development team, and when a released product meets a positive response from players, it's incredibly satisfying. And completing the full release brings drive and a burst of energy for new challenges!*

# Testing phases

Working in QA requires a creative approach. Understanding how and why mechanics crush down is quite a challenging task. Not only you have to find the problem, but also to bring up options for its solution, and then competently transfer all the information to the developer. To settle order in this creative chaos, the process is divided into **testing phases**. The phases help systematise the work of testers and define their tasks clearly.

Phases are divided into the following stages:

* Static testing;
* Module testing;
* Regressive testing;
* Negative testing;
* Integration testing.

# Static testing

This phase starts even before the programmer gets to touch the keyboard. The Game Designers send testers a document with a detailed description of the mechanics, no pictures, though.

>*The later we discover a bug, the more painful it will be to fix. If someone misses a mistake in the document and the mechanics are handed off to other departments to work on, corrections later can become virtually impossible or extremely resource and time-consuming.*

>*© Veriford*

https://preview.redd.it/wjb8t3x2nvzd1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=04270b08f4373fd9fad8097906973f2a50eef61d

After from static testing, all other phases are being held directly in the game.

*— Finally, we get a chance to play!*

*— You wish…*

# Module testing

At this point, the mechanic is explored in isolation from the rest of the game. The goal is to understand whether the mechanic can “Run on its own” or not. In the technical requirements\* documentation, the Game Designers describe what “strings” testers need to pull the feature and make sure that the strings move completely fine.

>\*Technical requirement (TR) — a document that outlines the actions the testers must perform in order to complete the task.

*Besides common interactions, QA also uses configurations as special operation tools. They allow you to change the properties and numerical values of objects and appearances, like mutant speed, their target priority, or the projectiles' trajectory.*

This is the moment where tester's experience is worth its weight: it helps to understand which settings need to be changed in the configs and where the bugs are hidden.  
QA records all inconsistencies in a report and then assigns them to programmers and waits until everything is fixed to proceed to the next phase.

# Regressive testing

https://preview.redd.it/nvjhxrfxbvzd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=546f1e2724051f7d4c0d2f5c0a2efae532ddb5fc

After fixing all the bugs, the QA specialist performs regression testing according to the TR. It includes double-checking not only what has been fixed, but all functionality, even that which has already been tested. The freshly caught bugs are sent back to the programmers, and the testers are waiting to go through this stage again once fixes are applied. Again, then again. It's a buzz kill, but it assures quality.

Don't forget that fixing one gear can take out an entire machine. That can be crucial, since many game mechanics are intertwined with each other. Regressive testing is performed after any changes applied to a feature: fixing, tweaking, or changing its parameters. Even when… no, especially when you switch one letter in a code.

# Negative testing

Picture it, like using a coffee mug to butter a bread loaf. You can do it, technically, but that's not how it was originally implemented.

If (upon completing the regressive testing) the feature works as intended and has all crucial bugs patched out, the tester commences a negative testing. That includes testing practically everything, even the most ridiculous ways of interacting with the mechanic. Who would have thought that someone would decide to press all the buttons at once or reach outside the map in a main quest?

https://preview.redd.it/dlgxpzq9cvzd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b6c1876458791a18ebef0188d2ccaa0a02e35b4

*Sometimes negative testing is done in parallel with regressive testing, though this is not always successful. After all, if a serious bug is found at the previous stage, negative testing is of no use. You will have to repeat the process anyway, through pain, sweat, and tears. Again and again, until the “offender” is caught red-handed.*

# Integration testing

The mechanic is then integration tested on a test server with the latest version of the game to check how it bonds with other mechanics and elements of the game.

*For instance, when mutant territories were added, they were made so that they would only attack at very close range. Thus, the mutants wouldn't stick to the player's back for the whole location. Though, we had overdone it with boars, as they had become completely pacifistic towards the player.*

If problems arise, the team goes back a step, fixes them, and repeats the process until it's complete. This is the stage that most of the dupes and other economy crashing bugs are detected. And only after all of that the mechanic will be pushed on the main server, where players are. Obviously, it happens after the maintenance. But we will talk about that later.

*The QA accompanies the production of a feature, starting from the documentation and up until full release. And, utilizing various approaches, each testing phase detects bugs.*

>*Hooray, you did it! You have tested out one mechanic, and it's actually working like intended. Ready to engage in it on the main server? Hold your horses now. There are a thousand more changes ahead that crave your attention.*

https://preview.redd.it/jtlg2wvpdvzd1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=2cea6338eaaa20f539260341296eda73a19e3633

The example we brought up is a perfect circumstance of testing in a vacuum. In practice, the situation is a bit different. During the documentation phase, the team estimates how long it will take to develop and based on that, sets a release date for the update. And since many other elements are being developed simultaneously, the elements form the release order.

*The order represents a queue of major projects, filled with lots of new elements. Sometimes one or more key elements of a project are not ready, and without them there is no point in releasing it because it just won't work. Plus, test results are always unpredictable. There may be bugs so tricky that they will postpone the release far to the back of the queue.*

In such cases, you have to reschedule it. However, if the project is one hundred percent ready, it's good to be released in time. Minor and non-essential little things can be added later. We always want to add up something new in the game, and do it as fast as we can.

Smaller features, (such as QoL) usually don't wait for the queue. They are being patched out on the main server when ready. Sometimes, a feature like attachments or artefacts highlighting can be added right before the maintenance.

Projects that are hard-wired with barbed wire to set dates are also out of the queue. That includes new seasons and events. There is simply no option of not finishing them in time. When time is limited, you must concentrate completely, even if you're working on other important projects: you have to meet the deadline regardless.

*Interesting fact: if the testing of the “Day X” update had followed the perfect scenario, the release wouldn't have had occurred until 2025.*

# Open and private tests

https://preview.redd.it/59s691y1evzd1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=06b99b758106f3c13798cbf4092806c006db00a0

However, the QA team isn't the only one who tests new mechanics and updates. There are a few other groups that help improve the quality of the released content. Let's look at them! We'll start with the smallest ones. You may find yourself in one of these groups. Or maybe you will find yourself there in the future. Who knows?

# Focus group

The small but talented team explore mechanics that require player-to-player interaction. It relates to session battles, events, etc. Their main goal is not to look for bugs, although that happens as well. Rather, a focus group estimates the behaviour of players in a real-environment setting, checking whether the game is being played as designed. They look for mechanic weaknesses and recommend fixes. It's a kind of “cringe control”. By the way, it is pointless to ask what they are testing. All of them have signed NDA.

# Private test group

https://preview.redd.it/mrb5dlczevzd1.png?width=940&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e8a10b1c51b0f41364498f39b83b2bd93c82e76

Before the release of the “Day X” update, we have decided to do this experiment. Players were specially taken different: from experienced Zone Gigachads to beginners, who launched the game for the first time during the tests. This allowed us to simulate a near-real-time online experience within a single copy of each location. And the different levels of participants prevented false data reflecting the self-interest of a particular group. The team had a total of 200 members.

*These guys have been called upon to check the global transformation of the game and examine anything they think is weird or wrong. New movement system, northern locations, storyline and other mechanics introduced after “Day X”. The playable versions of the mechanics were obtained by testing numerous elements in close collaboration with the responsible developers.*

The group was closed. The participants had signed NDA to keep the surprise for the rest of the players. Concerns about leaks proved to be in vain. There was only one case of careless disclosure in this group.

Initially, it was thought to devote only two weeks to these tests. But it turned out to be so convenient in terms of collecting statistics and feedback. So these groups in different compositions worked for several months and are still working today. All in all, the experience was quite successful. There will likely be some more recruitment for this group in the future, so keep an eye out for in-game mail and resource information.

# Open test server

It was last opened recently in order to test the Black Raid event ranking system. Thanks to the players, we identified the weaknesses of the system, corrected it by the time of release and managed to roll out a series of hotfixes in the first days after it. Aside from rankings, tests told us that the evacuation mechanics need to be more flexible, and Converts from the Murmur need to be shot in the knees. Since the latest patch release, players are now able to summon a helicopter without having to wait for the timer. Also, Converts have become slightly weaker, giving survivors a fighting chance against them.

*If you've been with us long enough, you may remember how open tests were conducted before the releases of “The Inside Out” and “Anomalous Blizzards” events. Several times, open tests have taken place before global rebalances of gear and artifacts. And the new AI has even been tested a couple of times.*

There were several iterations of large-scale tests when we changed the mutant pathfinding mechanism from Minecraft to our NavMesh. It's a big feature with a lot of unexpected moments, and it's impossible for one team to cover everything.

>*That's when players come to assistance. Among the interesting things: for the first time, the coordinates were displayed on the screen for an open test server. Previously, you had to search for a place with the map or a screenshot, which the player attached.*

>*On the occasion of these tests, we even made unique charms in the form of mutants covered with NavMesh. They were given out both for participation and for finding rare bugs.*

>*© Mongol*

These mass tests are needed to see how a unique mode or mechanic will perform when at full loadout, to tweak the balance, and to have a look at the changes a fresh pair of eyes. Well, and bonus, they help to find some fresh or forgotten bugs.

|| || |\*Players are asked to participate in tests to check out big changes affecting all elements of the game, to stress-test servers, and to examine new mechanics and modes in real-world environments.\*|

# “The bug is known, when's the fix?”

Despite the whole test system, some bugs still leak to the main server.

Yes, most of the bugs players will never see. The QA team manages to identify about 95% of them and fix before updates go into production, but those five percent… Even when they're detected, they can wait quite a while for their chance to be fixed.

The time to fix each bug depends on its criticality, priority, number of affected players, and team resources. But these are not mutually exclusive criteria, but rather combinable. The bigger the bug's impact on the game, the faster it will be fixed.

Firstly, we fix dupes and bugs that make further play impossible, do not allow you to advance in the story or lead to the closure of the client.

These flaws are fixed first, despite the labour cost, because they are immune to the “non-priority” spell.

https://preview.redd.it/tsmmqk8gjvzd1.png?width=1697&format=png&auto=webp&s=7b3a49390054632d8bbbed219c7d00a7adbffe58

*Some bugs may remain uncorrected for a long time because their correction requires the attention of a particular programmer. For example, distracting a developer from creating the dungeons for the sake of fixing the trajectory of rats that run in a zigzag instead of a direct attack is* usually impractical\*.\*

|| || |*By the way, it would be helpful to remind what to do if you* are attacked by a bug.*You should never panic! The bug can smell fear! It is necessary to calmly go to the section of the official website* [*“Support Centre”*](https://support.exbo.net) *and create a ticket. You should describe the problem with concrete facts and in maximum detail without emotion, without forgetting to attach a photo or a video with* evidence of the “committed crime”\*.\*|

Now let's talk about the reward. You probably already know that a responsible developer determines the criticality of a bug and the reward for its detection. Let's take a look at the whole process.

After you inform the Support about finding a bug, you are sent a form that must be filled out completely. Be sure to attach a photo or, better yet, a video confirmation. The bug is then passed on to the testers, and after that it goes to the developer for fixing, and after fixing it again for testing. If the bug is obvious, it goes straight to the developer for fixing and then back to testing.

*The Support Team asks for photo/video proofs in order to QA Team was able to replay the bug. That is usually the main factor affecting the speed of fixing. The easier a bug is to demonstrate, the easier it is to start planning to fix it.  Or cast the “non-priority” spell once again!*

[An example of a form to fill out](https://preview.redd.it/szlbim45jvzd1.png?width=1185&format=png&auto=webp&s=093e1aca86e4bd65f93acad36e9ce2239e0961c2)

*When the bug reaches the developers, they evaluate whether the bug is dangerous or not and whether it is worth giving a reward for it. The developers then passes this information to the support agent, who informs the player found the bug.*

>*Rewards are given for serious bugs that directly affect the economy or gameplay, and only to the first person who reports it to support. That's why you may hear the phrase “The bug is already known” when several people submit the same problem. This is exactly the case when the fastest fingers of the Wild West decide the winner.*

# The most elusive and complex bugs

Among the bugs that leak to the main server, there are some that are not so easy to detect. There aren't many of them, but it doesn't mean they don't need to be fixed. Here are a couple of such bugs that have already been identified and eliminated.

# Old airdrops

One of the most complicated bugs was even back in the old North. It was the duping of rewards from airdrops. To make it work, two people had to pick up all the rewards with millisecond accuracy once the drop activated. It was extremely difficult to achieve this even on a test server, and such a coincidence is possible once in a million in a real game.

**Whirlpools on the edge of the map**

To be more specific, the appearance of artifacts in whirlpools at the edge of the map and in inaccessible places. Fixing it wasn't the main difficulty, because disabling artifact spawn at the anomaly is as simple as ABC. The problem was to identify all the anomalies throwing artifacts off the map.

https://preview.redd.it/w0bihj85lvzd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d4fdf5de0197f0552f4d9041eee9f3083fa655f

The system is set up to allow all anomalies to throw out artifacts by default. It's possible only to disable this option manually for each anomaly separately. Accordingly, searching for whirlpools, lighters, and discharges that throw artifacts into inaccessible places was almost manually. To remove anomalies from the borders of the map is not an option either, they have to be there. They themselves are situated within the boundaries of the locations, but they “spit” artifacts wherever they want.

>*That problem has already been solved. We requested an artifact collection database from the analysts, looked at where artifacts were almost never raised, and literally “flew” all over the locations, catching anomalies that were out of the players' range and disabling their spawning.*

>*© Veriford*

In general, there should be very few or no such anomalies left. **If you find such an anomaly, please report it** to [**Technical Support**](https://support.exbo.net) with the exact location and attach a screenshot. We will definitely fix this problem.

|| || |\*Disabling spawning at some anomalies will not affect the total number of artifacts per eruption. That is, artifacts that were supposed to appear in them will spawn elsewhere.\*|

# Online during Server Maintenance

https://preview.redd.it/in2mpwhdmvzd1.png?width=807&format=png&auto=webp&s=c00500805e8b50a5fb2863c500d355d78ecc4e56

The last artifact story is interesting because it could only be fixed on the main server. And it's not the only one. A similar situation happened also with artifacts outside the map in the rusty barrels.

Because of the database differences between the test server and the main server, the problem was not solved immediately.

*The test server was fine, but on the main server, sometimes artifacts would fall into the decoration and couldn't be picked up. Well, you know how it was. Turns out the problem wasn't the spawn, but the prioritization of interactions. The game “believed” that the barrel was more important to the player than the artifact. Fortunately, these times have faded into the past, leaving only nostalgic memories of Viburnum Branches and Polyhedrons in rusty barrels.*

Test and main environments are like two twins with different personalities. Some bugs that may show up on the main server are simply impossible to catch on the private test server.

**During Server Maintenance**, testers go into the game immediately after the updates are uploaded and check the changes on the main server. After all, it's important to make sure everything runs like clockwork.

The upgrade test is the final stage of Server Maintenance. First, a backup is created to roll back changes if the release doesn't work as planned. Changes and new content are uploaded to all the servers. It takes some time, especially as the databases get bigger and bigger. The testers then log into the server to make sure the update was successful.

Hence, the length of Server Maintenance: the bigger the patch, the more data we have to load and check everything thoroughly.

*During Server Maintenance, the team is not idling, and, of course, is not looting emissions with ZIV, but downloading updates and running final tests before launch.*

# Conclusion

Well, we have spilled the beans, and now you've seen what stages of testing each piece of new content goes through. You have taken a peek behind the scenes of the updates and found out who's out there working on Server Maintenance before the launch. And we have also talked about bugs that don't get fixed for a long time. Oh right, you also now know how you can help some tests in the future.

It said “Twilite Drive-In” with Twilite in big neon letters and a star.  That’s the city’s drive in sign.  They took it down when the drive-in closed and gave it to us later.  Across the street is a car dealership and every year they still move 200 new cars out of the lot and fill it with vintage cars and call them “Twilite Cruises”.  After we were there for 17 years, it became the Corset Shop  and now it’s Daddy’s Rich Bitz women’s boutique.  I’m a bit crazy because I didn’t date much.  I tried.

Shortly after it arrived we put a large American Gothic painting in front of our shop with the face holes cut out so people could stick their heads in and take pictures.  The statue is gone now but some of the murals are still there but a bit washed out.



Also at our shop’s current location, up the road in Saginaw, the city tore down a large silo.  On the silo was the largest neon rabbit in the world.  The Bean Bunny. We had a miniature neon of it made along with mini Twilite neon. Up the road the other way are more silos painted with the second largest mural in the US.

The party happend in thursday, we didn't have to go to school the day after, than there was weekend, i wasn't in school on monday, tuesday and wednesday, i didn't see her in school in thursday but in friday i met her, just as i noticed her she came to me to greet me and asked how i was doing, we had a bit of a small talk, she asked me how i liked the party, i said that ''you made it better'' she smiled but i had to go to class so we said our goodbyes, we met a few times troughout the day in hallways, we both just smiled at eachother, than, when school was ending and i was going home we met again, chated for a bit, and i found courage to ask her if she wanted to go somewhere with me, she asked me, in a nice tone, ''like a date?'' and i said ''maybe'' she said ''i don't know, maybe'' but in a flirty tone, than said ''like to some coffee shop?'' i said that i don't drink coffee but i'd go, she asked me if i'm going to school in monday, because i'm not in school everyday, i said that probably not, but i will be in school at tuesday, than her teacher wanted to talk to her so we said goodbye to each other, and yeah, that's where i'm now. I want to know from you if i have any chance, and what can i do to go out with her.",1,1731164069.0,teenrelationships,0,1.0,False

He has female friends 2 of who are exs and one of the exs he messages daily. I was uncomfortable with this but didnt have no evidence to suggest anything was going on. I had took him away for his birthday and the morning after I saw a message come up on his phone from a woman saying goodmorning with xx.

I was horrified, and confronted him, he explained this is a friend only, in the end he did block her for me. Another time we was out having lunch he went bathroom with his phone, he was on whatsapp the whole time in bathroom. We left to come home and around 20 mins later a message from another woman comes up saying cant wait to speak to you later babe, i finish work between 7 to 8.

  
I was mortified, he denied everything, saying the message wasnt for him, as he hadnt spoken to her in months, he blocked her too. By now my self esteem and trust in him has gone, we spoke about things and my feelings and he reassured me that he was only in contact with 4 females whose names he gave- who are friends only and he even swore this on his kids life, he looked me straight in the eyes and said I can trust him.

  
Couple weeks later he said he was going to shop, i offered to come he refused, making out he was going to buy me something and will bring back lunch and would be gone 45 mins- he was gone 3,5 hours.

Naturally, this started a massive argument, he denied any wrong doing, he explained he sat in a coffee shop for 2 hours on his own then went for a drive, i asked to see his phone, he refused. in the days after that he went for a shower and he didnt want to leave his phone behind, he kept walking back into the room, picking it up, checking whats app, until I said go shower. He did, but was a very quick shower.

  
We had rocky weeks after this, my confidence in him has gone, and arguments are starting, i said to be together there cant be no more lies, be honest with me about who he is in contact with, he agreed no more lies. 

To cut a long story short, i noticed he on whats app a lot but not messaging me, i asked him about this he explained he was making plans to see the boys yesterday to go cinema, he was very clear who was going and even said he would send me photos. The night happened and no photos come in and his phone goes off for 2 hours.

  
My daughter was at the same cinema and confirmed he wasnt there, i asked him about his night and what he did he explained how he gone to the town, went for food, he even explained the walk he did and where they ended up, i asked who was there, he said 3 male names, and even said he had dropped one of the guys off. I confronted him and said I know your lieing and explained that my daughter was at the cinema, he went quiet, i said are you going to be honest, he said YEAH. He then admitted he was out with a female, a friend apparently, and didnt tell me as he knew I would go mad, I said what female, he refused to tell me saying he dont want me tracking her down. I said but you promised your not in contact with other women. He then made out his male friend was there too, i said your lieing. He then started laughing, and then said actually i wasnt at the cinema where i said i was , i was at another cinema, i didnt tell you as didnt want you turning up. He then asked to see the proof i had of his lies, he twisted it all back on me. I said to him your a cheat, he said prove it.

We not spoken in a few hours now, I cant get over how someone can lie and treat me like this. I have been nothing but good to him, i pay for 90% everything. Im honest with him and loyal. It has upset me as how can someone say they love you, but deceive you.

We got a customer that, when double checking his order, he said it was good then paid. He then realized it wasn’t his order. Ok fine i’ll call for a manager to come sort it out. No one came so we did it.
The customer still messed up what was suppose to be in his coffee but we got it in the end.

1gnboxb,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI__Stories/comments/1gnboxb/the_iris_interface/,The Iris Interface,"Allen was an engineer with an unquenchable curiosity. He spent his days developing cutting-edge technology, his nights filled with thoughts of the future. So, when an invitation arrived asking if he’d like to participate in the trials for a new type of augmented reality (AR) device, he didn't hesitate. This device wasn’t a pair of glasses or a headset—it was something far more revolutionary: an AR contact lens.

The lens, known as “Iris,” was the result of years of secret development. It was designed to integrate seamlessly into the wearer’s eye, becoming a new layer of perception. As Allen inserted the contact lens, it melded perfectly with his vision, as if it had always been there. He blinked a few times, adjusting to the crispness of the world around him. Everything seemed sharper and more vibrant, almost as if he were seeing in ultra-high definition.

As he looked around the room, Iris’s capabilities began to reveal themselves. An almost imperceptible series of transparent arrows appeared in his field of vision, pointing out his coffee mug on the desk, a keyring on a distant counter, and a small bundle of cables he’d lost earlier that week. Each arrow floated gracefully, adapting to the distance and angle of his view, ensuring nothing obstructed his natural sight. He realized Iris was not merely an overlay but an intelligent guide, analyzing his gaze and anticipating his needs.

Out of curiosity, Allen tested Iris's audio capabilities. He knew the device could detect even the tiniest vibrations of sound and translate them into enhanced auditory information, but he hadn’t expected it to be so advanced. He closed his eyes and listened. Suddenly, he could hear the faint hum of a fly buzzing against the window from across the room, and somewhere outside, the rustling of leaves from the wind as though he were right beside them. The world was full of life in ways he had never experienced before. The pitch and tone of every sound felt so finely tuned that it was like wearing a pair of high-quality headphones that filtered only what mattered most.

He ventured outside to test the device’s capabilities further. As he walked through a park, Iris highlighted points of interest with translucent arrows and labels. Allen saw notifications for nearby historical plaques he’d never noticed, botanical information about the plants and flowers surrounding him, and even bird species that Iris identified through subtle differences in appearance and calls. There was a surreal power in these digital enhancements, yet they felt natural as if these details had always been waiting just beneath the surface of his perception.

Allen wandered toward an open field nearby, covered in wild clover. He had read that Iris’s resolution was so high that it could enable a person to pick out something as specific as a four-leaf clover. Skeptical but intrigued, he focused his gaze on the sea of green at his feet. Instantly, Iris responded. A small, delicate outline appeared, subtly tracing around one clover out of thousands. He knelt down, brushing his fingers over the delicate leaf, confirming it was indeed a four-leaf clover. Iris’s precision amazed him.

As Allen stood up, he received a prompt—a soft pulsing in his peripheral vision accompanied by a quiet notification sound. Iris’s neural interface was prompting him for a deeper exploration. With a single thought, he allowed the device to activate a new feature: emotion-based contextual feedback. The contact lens scanned his surroundings, picking up details in the atmosphere, and temperature, and even analyzing micro-expressions of passersby. It provided subtle hints about people’s moods, allowing him to intuit interactions better.

Over time, Allen became adept at using Iris to navigate both the digital and physical realms with seamless precision. But the real power of the device lay in something unexpected: its ability to subtly influence his sense of empathy and awareness of the world. He found himself noticing people and places he’d overlooked, feeling more attuned to the world’s quieter rhythms, from the glint of morning dew to the complex expressions of people hurrying past.

As the trial continued, Allen realized that Iris was far more than a technological breakthrough. It was a gateway to an enhanced, deeply immersive understanding of the world. He felt empowered, not just as an engineer witnessing the pinnacle of human innovation but as a person rediscovering the world through fresh, profoundly insightful eyes.",1,1731163779.0,AI__Stories,0,1.0,False

( and she always took it) during Covid my dad called her to give her an extra 300 dollars just because we knew she was out of works. My grandma is fluent in her native language and would talk and chat about life and agreed she was a good lady. She loved my little brother . She remembered my youngest siblings as babies. As I am writing this she is currently cleaning my house. My mom is planning on showing her the video after and taking the money back and not paying her this time. Over time she has definitely stole thousands of dollars. This is honestly heartbreaking. She went through my parents vanity and found the hiding spot my dad puts cash. ( and no it’s not obvious not at all) and her job was never to go in any drawers. There has been times where we have all felt we had money missing.., Her rate was cheaper compared to everyone else. She was coming every other week. I’m absolutely disgusted. If she wanted more money, my mom would’ve came up with a better rate. We’ve done a lot for her. I’m disappointed and scared for the confrontation. She is lucky we won’t go to police because if we do she will get deported ",20,1731163547.0,housekeeping,33,0.89,False

We have always promised true transparency, (not Pamsparency) with the lawsuit brought against Swede, Trapper, Pammycakes and myself. In keeping with this promise, we can tell you that we met with our lawyer yesterday. Everything is going to plan. At the end of next week, he plans on filing for a dismissal of the suit based on the premise that there is no cause for a lawsuit to be had here and we agree. However, we know Pam is itching to collect 15 million from each one of us so she can go back to her life of snackies, reclining naked on her white couch and not having to work. (Allegedly😂)

We can more than prove that Pam was lying in the first place or she’s lying now about things because the proof we have is either from public records or came out of her own mouth (or fingers) and she posted online for public consumption as she has claimed she is a “public figure”, as it were. 

The four of us are gathering our screenshots and videos of lives and compiling them. If you have read the complaint you already know what we are presenting in a professional and truthful manner. If you need a copy of the complaint, Swede has redacted copies of it and has generously offered to send it to anyone who would like to have a copy. It’s public information but Pacer can be difficult to navigate. (Or it is for me…luckily I have my very own copy 😂) Please inbox her by clicking on her username and requesting for a copy to be sent to you by email. 

Our lawyer was surprised to hear that there are over 1600 people in this group who support us, are willing to help us (thank you again!) defend our 1st amendment rights against the Webster’s lies and greed.

So, that’s where we are today. We are asking that once you get a copy of the complaint, read it and then you can post your receipts here or send them to us in a message. 

Some of the things we are sending our attorney (who is representing all four of us together) are things to do with CMF, Far Presentation, Matt’s enviable vacation schedule while collecting a taxpayer paid salary, why CPS was involved, why the Webbies moved from Jersey to Myrtle Beach to Pawley’s Island to Florida, her mental status before, during and after last August and how the business was doing prior to the original snark group being founded last Summer. As you can imagine, we have loads of material but we know there’s more. Discovery is going to be golden. Bonus: it becomes public information! 

It will be amazing when Pamela and Matthew and their attorney see that for all their talk of being scared, the kids are scared, Ms Kaitlyn is scared, and claims they’re being harassed and stalked seem to just be things they *allegedly* have used to create sympathy sales and a narrative that draws attention from the realization that they lie about their lives.

We appreciate each of you guys and all of your support. Truth is truth. Always. 

If you have questions or concerns or just want to help, please do not hesitate to ask. We are truly transparent and we are on the right side of the truth. 

Love you guys💕

PS. Also, over the next few weeks we will pull up our chairs, grab some coffee or your favorite beverage to discuss each of the 15 counts in the suit. Sundays are now known as “Have Several Seats Sunday.”  We can discuss each count in depth. Get your copy of the complaint (142 pages). Message Swede! ❤️

1gnbi3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BattleAces/comments/1gnbi3y/dear_dayvry_beta_2_day_3/,Dear Dayv-ry: Beta 2 Day 3,"Starting a little before the rollover. It’s noon and I am already done with work for the day (finally caught a break). I’ve got a cup of coffee, half a bag of Twizzlers, and I am ready to go.



I keep on with Gunbot/Wasp to some effect, getting points in plat. After a couple games, the system rolls over and I have the following new objectives: build bases, tech, destroy bases, gather. Simple. Should just about get me level 9. I do find myself daydreaming about some more gonzo dailies (see my post about Subbing and curated free decks).



After an hour, I am up to about the top of platinum (one time within in 6 points of clearing the league, only to queue into a Top Ace, aaaaahhhhhhh) and I have finished my dailies. Here in platinum I am feeling the meta shift, possibly because unit picks have a large influence on achievement, possibly because high achievement players pick better and more expressive units. I am coming up against Mortars, Destroyers with high frequency. I am playing against some really high tier Blink aggression, savvy scorpion control, and decisive timings. 1-base King Crab and Butterfly all-ins are still a thing.



In fact, let’s do a little survey of the decks I have encountered so far. Leaving aside the freebie decks for streamers and noting that this is highly unscientific, I found that:



* Iron/Bronze Leaguers played Crab/Hunter into King Crab, Butterfly, or Dragonfly and no consistent trend in unlocked units was apparent. Strategic trends were also largely absent, totally to be expected with many players in the early stages of learning.
* Silver/Gold Leaguers played Recalls or Knights, with Gunbots and Wasps (usually rushing) more rarely. Missilebots and Hunters were equally likely as AA but very occasionally it was Blink Hunters. In the Foundry, the frequent unit was King Crab then Shocker, in Starforge the frequent add was Mammoth. One base all-ins are not every game, but they were common enough, and most games ended before Tier 3.
* Platinum/Emerald has seen Knights drop off, Recalls, Scorpions, and Blinks take centre stage. Missilebots were the predominant AA. Mortars, Destroyers, Heavy Hunters, and King Crabs are dominating the Foundry picks, with Behemoths joining in (mostly in the 2xT3 strat from beta 1 of Behemoth/Heavy Ballista). In the Starforge, three-base Bulwark is a common win condition, with little emphasis on T2 air except for a few timing attacks and T1AA to shore up the T3 push, high base count games became more common (especially with Recall players, but it was true across the board), but this trend may also reflect my more long term strategies with Gunbots.
* Diamond ??? Let me know what you’ve seen.
* Top Ace seems like a mixed bag, looking at the ladder the 14 or so players have a mix of creator decks with whatever and basic players who bought Mortars, Shockers, Destroyers and a good amount of tanky picks in the Crusader and Mammoth.



All that said, I joined in on the Plat meta, bought the Destroyer and ditched my favourite cutie, the Recall Shocker. This simplifies a few things when picking techs, double splash wasn’t suuuuper flexible. It also lets me ditch the Butterfly as a titan slayer for the more micro-able Dragonfly or the return of my favourite wedge of cheese, the Stinger. In the end, though, this didn’t really help my win rate all that much as my most common match-up in the Foundry is now KC/Destro vs. KC/Destro. At least I can delete some Crabs.



I play off and on for two more hours, the ladder fatigue is getting stronger as the rewards have dried up. I have several times crested just shy of Emerald league and my rank points rate has dropped this side of the ladder, so win streaks no longer generate huge movement. My next unlock might come sometime next week. On the plus side, certainty has replaced dread in my mind, I am no longer constantly interrogating how I think the beta will go, I feel that I know. This has transformed my ennui from a malignant and depressing force to a placid and calming one. The negative, of course, is obvious, placidity isn’t the same as pleasure. Games have taken on a meditative quality, rather than a rush. I feel detached.



I did come back after a brief break to get my evening in order for some 2v2s with a fella from the Discord. I have heard a lot of lowkey hype about 2v2 in the Discord so far. The addition of a second deck means that each team has a more complete roster of units and can create more diverse combos as well as interesting staggered expansion and tech timings. Even more than in beta 1, I can see why this is appealing given I have unlocked only 3 units.



After committing the obligatory initial faux pas of joining the wrong 2v2 queue without my comrade and making him wait while I cheese out with mass Butterfly, we got into some games. Tier 1 fights are definitely fun with up to four unit types right out the gate. Long games are also more chaotic and I am going to have to get better about keeping track of four players worth of tech instead of two. The ping system could be more robust so in the meantime, bring a microphone. But yeah, this mode is good, just as punchy as 1v1, I will definitely play more.



Went to bed feeling mostly good, though I know I will not unlock a new bot tomorrow, I have a good chance of breaking into Emerald. I am a bit sad that Emerald is probably where I will cap out, given the number of players is low I am struggling to maintain a high win rate as I queue into the stable of high tier players with some regularity. In fact, I have been taking breaks from the game when this happens to avoid getting stuck playing the same Top Ace three games in a row. Those games are fun, they get intense and I get to flex my developing Gunbot micro (such as it is) more than normal, but it is tough to press that Join Queue button knowing that boanaan or someone is pressing it at the exact same moment. So I refrain, close the game for a minute and chill in the Discord. I don’t feel frustrated per say, neither by the matchmaking or the delay, as I understand the math of ladders and MMR, but it does break that lovely gameplay loop, that “one more game” feeling. This will be fixed when the ladder population is higher, there is no other solution, so I am patient.



Woke up early and played a game before writing this. Got wrecked by Blinks… again. I need to develop my instincts for trading against this unit; I keep overcommitting when I should surrender map control and stay home. Now I am going to work. Yes I work Saturday, yes it sucks, but it is ok because in my spare time I can come home and play a game about being a worker for a mega-corporation and/or a cog in the military industrial complex… waitaminute.

I have been on 60mg Vyvanse per day for several months now (40mg in the morning and 20mg in the afternoon). A few weeks ago I began feeling off in my body on some days. A couple days a week I would feel very anxious and could feel my heart beating fast. At certain points it would reach 120bpm sitting still.

After googling it and freaking out, I decided to reduce my daily caffeine (from 4 cups to 2) and brew my coffee twice as weak. I also went to the GP to refer myself onto a quit smoking programme. So yeah, I am a smoker too, and I also use bloody nicotine pouches.

It has all started to make a lot of sense. Combining 3 different stimulants should obviously raise heart rate and cause anxiety. However, I can’t quit caffeine and nicotine cold turkey, because the medication becomes less effective. It’s probably only a short term problem, I understand, and should probably boost its effectiveness once I’ve dealt with those addictions.

In the meantime, does anyone have any advice how to go about navigating this situation? I still feel strong urges to consume more caffeine and nicotine alongside my medication, and I know that it isn’t being tolerated well by my body. Thanks for any suggestions.

P.S. does anyone know of any possible reasons I could be experiencing more potency for my medication? Perhaps there are other dietary or lifestyle reasons the body is processing the chemical slower?

But somehow I am ending up with having a crush with my coworker. 

She(23F) and I(29M) work at the same company, different team. She started early this year but I barely noticed her around the company. I’m not a good social person so I just talk to my team and never talk to others. We never talked before until September we bumped into each other and she initiated the conversation. Then after that, we ran into each other more often and the conversations went from work only to sharing life and hobbies. I knew I fell for her at that time so I tried to test the water. I asked her out for lunch, she said yes and I think it was great. 

For context, she is very friendly to everyone imo. She smiles and waves to anyone when she says hi. She likes to talk and get to know people. At the beginning I thought she talked to me because she was interested but then I realized it’s just how she is. 

Tbh, I think whatever happens between us will not go anywhere. I made my mind up and decided to stop before things turn awkward. I’m thinking asking her out one more time like lunch or coffee to talk about this. This is where I need yall advices. How do I ask about her feelings ? I also want to share my feelings about her. Should I say something like “ I know we’ve been spending some time together. I think it was great and I’ve had a very good time but I think I’m taking a wrong signals. What do you think about our relationship? Are we just friends ? “

1gnb5z1,https://www.reddit.com/r/idiopathichypersomnia/comments/1gnb5z1/sleep_apnea_and_pathological_sleepiness/,"Sleep Apnea and ""Pathological Sleepiness""","I was diagnosed with Obstructive Sleep Apnea almost 3 years ago after an at-home study (22 AHI), and I hoped a CPAP machine would be the light at the end of the tunnel for the fatigue I'd been battling for years (around 5 years of being brushed off with iron tests and thyroid tests all coming back normal, and ""motherhood"" being blamed for my symptoms). It took about 8 months between diagnosis and getting my CPAP machine, thanks to the CPAP recall disaster of 2021.

After about 3 months on CPAP I noticed that I felt better in many ways - waking up in the morning was easier. I went from grumpy and hating life, dragging myself out of bed, eyes barely open, mouth dry as a bone, headache, sore throat, blood pounding, to just... being awake and feeling normal in the mornings.

I felt a lot better, and my apnea events were less than 1 most nights, but I was still very sleepy. It was difficult to explain, because better is good! CPAP is working! But I was still quite sluggish, slow, craved a nap daily, and would get headaches almost daily in the afternoon. And slowly, over the next handful of months, the sleepiness got worse. Sometimes I felt a strong pressure around my eyes, a strong urge to close them, and if I blinked too long I could hear the ocean - I don't know if that's a thing. But for me it means sleep is very near, and it happened a couple of times while I was driving and waiting at a red light. I was so so terrified of falling asleep at the wheel.

So after about a year on CPAP, I got myself a Neurology appointment with a sleep specialist. She took over monitoring my CPAP compliance, and I told her what was going on, that I was still tired. She said that there is a medicine for patients who are still tired on CPAP, but she wanted to refer me to endocrinology to ""rule out other causes of fatigue"" first, and get any of my levels fixed, and then see where my fatigue was at and go from there.

Endo Doc scheduled me 2 months out, he ran about 25 blood tests, and every single one of them was normal except for a slightly low vitamin D. I'm a video game gremlin that doesn't like direct sunlight, so no surprise there. I took vitamin D gummies and got re-tested 3 months later, and my level is normal. 

So, clean bill of health, and my next Neuro Doc appt is scheduled 5 months out. I'm just telling you the months because of how much waiting I've done, and how many naps I've taken. While keeping 100% compliance on CPAP and strict sleep hygiene - bed at 10.30, wake at 7, never any coffee past 2pm, daily walks, hydration, etc. This process has taken years.

Neuro Doc said my next step was an in-lab sleep study and nap study. The PSG and MSLT. That my daytime sleepiness and 'urge to sleep' could be Narcolepsy and that has to be ruled out, and it's best to do those studies before I start any drugs or medicine, as I'd have to wean off them anyway for the study. It was scheduled 2 months out, which is a very quick turnaround for my area.

The worst part of the tests was the electrodes behind my ears, which hurt to lay down on. But my ears are whiny lil shits about everything that touches them, even silk hair bonnets and size small earbuds, so I don't listen to those guys.

The tech was very sweet and nice to me, and told me fun facts about the electrodes - they can tell what sleep stage you're at, and even tell when you're dreaming. I arrived at around 8pm, put on my pyjamas, got trussed up with a billion wires, and got into bed at 8.45pm. The tech brought me a white noise machine. I read my book, and shortly after I was ready to sleep because I'd had no coffee all day, and no nap either, plus she told me she had to wake me at 5.30am. I did struggle to fall asleep, and tossed and turned and my leg wires had to be taped on. Sleep latency was 35.4 minutes, I found out later.

The morning came, the tech woke me and unstuck the leg wires and chest strap and tummy strap. She said I had slept more than 60% of my 'time in bed', and my AHI numbers were low. Both those things meant I was eligible for the MSLT study. But she couldn't tell me anything else. I forgot to ask if I had dreamed.

When she said it would be '2 hours between naps', in my mind I thought it would be 2 hours between the end of one nap and start of another? But nope, it was 7am, 9am, 11am, 1pm and 3pm naptimes. So I barely had time to pee, order breakfast, and check my phone before the daytime tech came in to set up and calibrate me for the 7am nap. 

The daytime tech was even sweeter than the night time one had been, she said she absolutely didn't want me to worry or feel pressured to fall asleep, and I, too, was determined not to fret about it. I figured I'd definitely get 1 nap in, maybe 2 if they woke me at a rough time in the first nap. I wanted them to see my sleep, I didn't want or need to prove a particular point.

The tech did the calibration thing with me before every nap, and at the start of every nap she said through the microphone, ""now it's time to close your eyes, and have a wonderful nap"" and she said it in such a sweet kind voice that I melted into the pillow. It felt so cosy, and kind of amazing to have 'permission' to nap, something my whole life everyone has looked down at me for.

The first nap I felt like I was waiting, daydreaming, glad to be able to rest, but I didn't feel like I was sleeping. Sleep latency was 4 minutes.

The second nap was after breakfast, and after the same feeling of waiting, I felt the rounded waves of light sleep, the ebb and flow in and out of awareness. The click of the microphone and tech saying ""it's time to wake up"" jolted me out of blackness, so I did know I had slept in that nap. And logically I knew I had to have fallen alseep before the 20 minute mark, so I guessed that it had taken about 15 mins to fall asleep. Sleep latency was 11.6 minutes.

The 3rd nap felt like waiting, I didn't feel like I had slept. I daydreamed a lot about playing Hogwarts Legacy and was nervous because I needed to have a poo and was embarrassed to ask about it. Sleep latency was 10.7 minutes.

I was starting to twig that my 'nap sessions' went until about 35 mins past the hour. So I suspected perhaps I was actually sleeping for all of them. None of them had stopped at the 20 minute mark.

The 4th nap was after lunch and I definitely felt sleepy for this one, and being woken jolted me awake again. Sleep latency 3 mins.

The 5th nap I was not expecting to be able to sleep - I felt like surely 2 micronaps was more than I usually get in a day of normal activity, and this day in the hospital I'd sat reading my book all day and barely had any energy expenditure. Sleep latency 5.6 minutes.

It really hit home how much I'm battling fatigue and trying to stay awake all day. Having a whole day of not having to fight to stay awake was weird and kinda nice. But very draining to be woken up after a few minutes. The tech used oils to get rid of the glue in my hair, peeled off the stickers around my chin and eyes and chest, and said it'd take up to 10 days to get my results.

I got home at 4pm and went to bed very early at like 8.30pm.

The next morning I got the call about my results. The nurse said my overnight sleep looked great, no concern there, my apnea was well treated. She said I slept for all 5 naps, but got zero REM sleep, so Narcolepsy was ruled out, that left me with what the nurse called ""pathological sleepiness"". 

I booked a follow up with my Neuro Doc, 2 weeks out, and that's what I am waiting for now. 

Pathologically sleepy.

I’ve gone from 17 years of opiate addiction and chronic homelessness, to getting sober and being an urban hermit in an abusive relationship for 5 years, to being a home owner with a fully paid off house for the past 2 years after you died. Sometimes I wake up and I can’t believe that this is my life. I struggle a lot, I had to start over again in the words of Maine with nothing and not a dime to my name. Paying your property taxes has been so hard, apparently this land is valuable Jfc, but I’ve done it. Working 60+ hours each week, while raising 2 little boys all alone, it’s been a nightmare, but so blessed for our housing security.


Well, it gets better. Remember how I told you I was going to get sober for Gram, how I couldn’t live with myself if she died while I was still out using? She was proud of me dad, she was a stoic woman, and a woman of few words, I never knew how proud she really was. I got a phone call yesterday that just changed my life again. Apparently Grandma left her entire IRA to *me*…and it’s life changing money for someone like me. My nose is stinging and my eyes are watering as I’m typing this, I just can’t believe that this is happening. I got a message from some place called TIAA, and they had been sending my mail back to Cincinnati to my ex who never told me. So I’ve changed my address, and now I have until the 21st to figure out if I want a lump sum payment or if I want to keep it in the IRA, it’s so confusing. I’m going to hire an attorney on Tuesday (hope they’ll take their payment out of the inheritance because I don’t have Lawyer money lol). 

*So what do I do now?* This is life changing money, but it’s not “last for the rest of your life” money by any stretch of the imagination. I can probably buy myself a new car, take the boys on our first ever vacation, renovate the house so I can have my little loft that I’ve always wanted to read books and drink coffee and look out over the mountains. I remember sleeping in the hallways in -5° weather. I remember sleeping in project stairwells in Jamaica plains, Boston. I remember working as an escort in Brickell Miami to survive, and now I’m a PTA mom, with 2 kids who have no idea of my past, in a fully paid off beautiful little cabin in the Woods. And now I have an inheritance. Me. I have a fucking inheritance 😭

Sorry. I know I’m rambling. I just can’t believe that this is my life and I don’t know who to tell because there’s nobody left everybody’s dead.  I’m all alone in the world… I feel guilty being excited about this. I know there’s so many people in the world that are struggling, and the economy is terrible, and that’s me. I am people. I have like $400 in the bank right now, I live paycheck to paycheck. I just needed somebody to be happy for me. Thanks for reading",56,1731162035.0,DadForAMinute,23,0.99,False

Nope. Let me show you why through a practical example.

I recently worked with founders building tools for small sales teams. Everyone told them to ""talk to at least 50 salespeople."" But here's what actually happened when they focused on just 12 of the right people instead.

When founders chase ""50 interviews"" here's the mess that happens:

- They talk to anyone willing to give feedback
- They accept input from people who ""used to do sales""
- They drown in conflicting opinions
- They hear unhelpful advice like ""Just use Salesforce better!""
- Their notes become a jungle of contradictions
- They end up more confused than when they started

Here's why: If ten sales reps managing 20+ deals each quarter are trying to stay on top of follow-ups, they're probably:

- Using some combo of spreadsheets and calendar reminders
- Hitting identical walls with pipeline visibility
- Creating matching workarounds between tools
- Wishing for a way to know which deals need attention now

By conversation 12 with the right people, you'll be finishing their sentences. That's not coincidence. That's pattern recognition.

The usual traps that lead to bad research:

1\. The investor trap when investors push for ""more research,"" they connect you with:

- A VP of Sales who hasn't managed a pipeline since 2015
- An advisor who ""scaled multiple sales teams""
- A sales director who has their SDR handle follow-ups
- Other founders who ""built a sales tool once""

2\. The random sample trap

- Mixing active sales reps with ""anyone in revenue""
- Getting vague feedback like ""Most reps would probably...""
- Hearing generic opinions like ""Just add AI to everything""
- Counting coffee chats as customer research

What makes someone ""right""?

- They're managing 15-25 deals right NOW
- They've tried Salesforce, Hubspot, and countless spreadsheets
- They can show you their morning follow-up routine
- They have quota to hit this quarter

You've found your pattern when:

- You know they're using a separate spreadsheet before they mention it
- You can guess their Monday morning process
- Their frustrations with missed follow-ups sound familiar
- More interviews just confirm what you already know

Here's the truth: 50 random opinions will give you 50 different directions. 12 conversations with sales reps actively juggling deals will show you one clear path.

Stop diluting your insights with quantity. Start focusing on quality. Your product will thank you.",8,1731161688.0,startups,15,0.68,False
1gnazni,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeePH/comments/1gnazni/thoughts_on_brood_coffee/,Thoughts on Brood Coffee,"Just my random thoughts about Brood Coffee. This is not to bash them but hopefully for them to improve. I had very high hopes for this brand because it's a home grown brand and they have good pricing. I really hope they don't turn out like Pick Up coffee. I was really excited when they opened at SM Fairview because there's really not a lot of good affordable options there. The good ones are in Fairview Terraces (Zus and Cotti). Even Robinson's Novaliches has a Zus now. So, I don't know what's up with SM Fairview's coffee game. So anyway I tried Brood multiple times. Disclaimer I only ordered sweetened iced latte with oat.

So here are MY thoughts:
- Beans are too dark/bitter. I think it's even darker than Starbucks. It doesn't taste spacialty to me even though they're advertising it as specialty. But it's not bad beans, it's okay.
- Too much ice. I appreciate having a good amount of ice because I like my drink really cold but this has too much. The actual drink feels a lot less compared to Zus.
- They initially didn't have spanish latte but I think they do now. They had a similar drink but it tasted too creamy/milky/sweet. Spanish latte is basically just a sweetened latte which is a gateway drink for most people so I think they lost some opportunity there. I would imagine a lot of people ordering a latte for the first time and getting surprised that it's not sweet at all.
- Most of these are probably related to cost cutting which I also understand.

So overall, I hope they improve the beans and improve the ice ratio.

There's also another coffee kiosk Take O coffee which I tried a couple of times, they seem to use better beans and good pricing but their cup is just too big so the drinks are just overpowered by milk.",2,1731161673.0,CoffeePH,0,1.0,False
