Today is my off day and I thought to myself why not visit my girlfriends workplace and have lunch or coffee together, I picked her up as usual and I noticed something was off, so I asked and then she said 
 “ a very close colleague of mine hit my neck twice, and it felt good, so I told him to continue, he asked do i want a massage and I said why not, he said let’s go to a more private area and I followed, a hitting type of massage turned to a more touchy type of massage, and suddenly he was touching my back under my shirt and reached to my side boob and that’s when I felt really uncomfortable and told him keep his hands away, and remove it and I left uncomfortable ” 

I stayed silent for about 10 minutes and then comforted her for another 10 minutes and I started talking about how this whole scenario made me feel, but she didn’t validate my feelings and acted like a victim throughout the whole story “ how could a very close friend of mine and I thought I could trust this person” 

It’s very difficult to write all this to be honest, and reading it through again is making it sound more annoying.

So as the title says?

Last night I dreamed that my cat (his name is Mochi, for context) was my landlord. He wore a tiny suit, had a clipboard, and kept inspecting my apartment for violations.

I was frantically running around, hiding snacks under the couch, and trying to explain why there were so many empty coffee mugs in my room. He kept shaking his head, writing notes, and saying, ""This will affect your security deposit.""

At some point, he found my favorite hoodie and started charging me extra for fur rent. Then he stood on two legs and meowed loudly, which somehow summoned a bunch of other cats to do a final walk-through.

When I woke up, Mochi was sitting on my chest, staring at me like he knew what I had dreamed.

Now I can’t stop thinking he’s silently judging me for not cleaning the litter box yesterday.

If anyone wants to take a crack at what my subconscious is trying to tell me (besides that I should vacuum more), I’m all ears. Or maybe this is just the price of binge-watching weird animal TikToks before bed.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal copper tea kettle should be both aesthetically pleasing and functionally superior. The models reviewed here incorporate a range of features designed to enhance the tea brewing experience.

**Material and Construction:**

The quality of the copper used in a tea kettle is paramount. Premium kettles are typically constructed from heavy-gauge, pure copper, ensuring even heat distribution and long-lasting durability. Look for kettles with a seamless construction or expertly welded joints to prevent leaks and maintain structural integrity. The interior is often lined with tin or stainless steel to prevent copper from leaching into the water.

**Handle Design and Ergonomics:**

A well-designed handle is crucial for safe and agreeable pouring. Ergonomic handles made from heat-resistant materials like wood, silicone, or stainless steel are preferred. The handle should provide a secure grip and be angled away from the body of the kettle to prevent burns from rising steam. Some high-end models feature handles that stay cool to the touch, eliminating the need for oven mitts.

**Spout Design and Pouring Performance:**

The spout's design considerably affects the kettle's pouring performance.A gooseneck spout provides precise control over the water flow, making it ideal for pour-over coffee and delicate teas. Wider spouts are suitable for quicker, more general pours. The spout should also be designed to prevent drips and spills, ensuring a clean and mess-free experience.

**Heating Efficiency and Water Capacity:**

Copper is an excellent conductor of heat, allowing thes kettles to heat water quickly and efficiently. The water capacity can vary significantly, ranging from smaller personal kettles to larger models suitable for families or gatherings. Choose a capacity that aligns with your typical usage patterns. Look for kettles with encapsulated bottoms featuring a layer of aluminum or stainless steel for even faster heating on various stovetops.

**Lid and Whistle Mechanism:**

A secure lid is essential for preventing spills and retaining heat. The lid should fit snugly and be easy to remove for filling and cleaning. Many copper tea kettles feature a traditional whistle mechanism that signals when the water has reached a boil. the whistle should be clear and audible, but not overly loud or piercing. Some modern kettles use electronic whistles or temperature sensors for more precise and convenient operation.

**Exterior Finish and Aesthetics:**

Copper tea kettles are treasured for their beauty and timeless appeal. The exterior finish can range from a polished, mirror-like sheen to a more rustic, hammered texture.Some kettles are treated with a clear coat to prevent tarnishing, while others develop a natural patina over time, adding to their character. Choose a finish that complements your kitchen decor and personal preferences.

## core Benefits

The advantages of using a copper tea kettle extend beyond its aesthetic appeal, offering practical benefits that enhance the tea brewing and serving experience.

**Superior Heat Conductivity:** Copper's remarkable heat conductivity allows water to reach boiling point significantly faster than with other materials like stainless steel or glass. This results in time savings and energy efficiency,making it a practical choice for busy individuals.

**Natural Antimicrobial Properties:** Copper possesses inherent antimicrobial properties that can help inhibit the growth of bacteria and other microorganisms in the water. While not a substitute for proper water purification, this provides an added layer of hygiene and peace of mind.

**Enhanced Flavor and Aroma:** Some tea connoisseurs believe that copper kettles can enhance the flavor and aroma of tea by gently mineralizing the water during the heating process. This subtle effect can contribute to a more nuanced and enjoyable tea drinking experience.

**Elegant and Timeless Design:** The classic beauty of copper tea kettles adds a touch of sophistication and charm to any kitchen. Their timeless design makes them a cherished heirloom that can be passed down thru generations.

**Uniform Heating:** Copper distributes heat evenly across the kettle's surface, preventing hot spots and ensuring that the water heats consistently. This is especially vital for tea brewing, as it helps to extract the optimal flavor from the tea leaves.

## FAQs Section

**Are copper tea kettles safe to use?**
Yes, copper tea kettles are generally safe to use, especially those lined with tin or stainless steel. The lining prevents copper from leaching into the water,which can be harmful in high concentrations. Ensure the kettle is regularly cleaned and descaled to maintain its integrity.

**How do I clean and maintain my copper tea kettle?**
To clean the exterior, use a soft cloth and a mild copper cleaner. Avoid abrasive cleaners or scouring pads, as they can scratch the surface. To remove mineral deposits inside the kettle, boil a solution of water and vinegar. Rinse thoroughly after cleaning.

**Can I use my copper tea kettle on an induction stovetop?**
Some copper tea kettles are compatible with induction stovetops, but not all. Check the manufacturer's specifications to ensure that the kettle has a ferromagnetic base that will work with induction technology. Kettles with a copper-clad stainless steel bottom would usually work well.**Will my copper tea kettle tarnish over time?**
yes, copper naturally tarnishes over time, developing a patina. This patina can be removed with a copper cleaner, or you can choose to let it develop for a more vintage look. Kettles treated with a clear coat will tarnish less quickly,but the coating may eventually wear off.

1lyrb9c,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1lyrb9c/aita_for_stealing_my_cousins_birthday/,AITA for stealing my cousins birthday???,"Hi this is my first post so it might not be well written😅. I wont be using any real names and this is quite a complex story so keep in mind that this is just kind of a summary to what happend.

Ok so little context, l(18f) just turned 18 on 2nd of july. I have two cousins that live near me Jen(20f) and jay(15 almost 16m). Also another cousin Chris(15m) who lives more than 2000 km away but we still see him atleast once a year and l keep in contact with him.

My cousin Jen has always been the attention seeker somewhat. She demands attention and often puts on a performance so people would like her. Her voice gets high and she starts acting all bubbly. I still love her as a cousin but l always had issues with her as we were never that close and she literly lives 2 minutes away from me. Every oprotunity l got l tried getting closer with her but it never really worked. In highschool l was excited as she invited me for coffee on my frist day but that was literly the only time we went out in those two years that we were toghether in the same school. I saw her maybe 3 times in the span of two years?

She hasnt been to any of my birthdays for 3 years until my 18th wich was for family and she hasnt invited me to her 19th or 20th.

Last year the day of her 19th she called me and my mom over to help and spent the whole time explaining to me how great it was going to be and who was comming over and l got excited thinking shes telling me all this becouse shes inviting me. (I knew most her friends and she was inviting a girl younger than me so l knew it wasnt about age). She spent the whole day calling her friends making sure they could come and telling me about her plans. Than when it was time for me and my mom to leave she told me ""well l wont see you tonight since youre not invited but we will see eachother soon"" l was shocked... and a bit heartbroken. My mom knew l was a bit disapointed she didnt invite me but l never told her what Jen said to me.

Fast forward this year since 18 is a big number we started planning my birthday in january and had our place(restaurant) booked in the middle of january already. It was booked for 5th of july(Jens birthday) we asked her multiple times if it was ok with her and she had no problem with it. It was the only date that would work becouse of family who was traveling like chrises family and a few more relatives.

I felt super guilty but Jen assured me it was fine multiple times especially since it was my 18th (she celebrated hers twice. One for family one for friends and l attended both).

Than in april my Grandfather passed away. It wasnt a suprise as he had some health issues but it still hurt. I felt most sorry for my dad as it was his dad who passed away. In my culture if a close family member dies,the first few months after their passing you dont listen to music especialy on celenbrations so if somebody invited you to a praty or celebration youd politely decline and explain you were mourning loss of family. I could still listen on headphones but it aplied more to my dad and the other children of my grandfather aka my aunt and uncle).

Becouse of this we had to cancel my birthday at the restaurant we had planned wich honestly hurt me but l stayed quiet becouse l understood. I never enjoyed celebrating my own birthday much and usualy only invited a few griends and cousins for bowling or to go out, but this was one l was genuenly excited for.

Thankfully my parents still decided, mostly becouse of the family, to throw my birthday at home like a casual dinner.(we had to do it two times and split it so on the 5th of july my moms family would come and on the 12th of july my dads).
Again Jen knew from the start as chrises family couldnt stay till the 12th and some other relatives wouldnt be able to attend but she was fine with it. If anything she was acting like my excited older sister and asking me what l was planning on wearing and so on.

I still felt guilty that the family me and her share would be coming to celebrate my birthday on her day so l decided to get her a nicer gift. Here family usualy just gives money and she still got money from my parents but she got stuff from me aswell. Genuine gifts l thaught she would like and l knew she wanted try. 

Than on july 2nd came my birthday. I was home alone most of the early morning as my mom went to work and my dad wasnt working that day but he went to go swim at the pool(his way of working out) and to buy us breakfast wich l was fine with. When my mom came from work we all went to a casual but nice place for lunch and we had a nice time. I was expecting jen and her family to come later in the evening as well as chrises as they would be coming to our town that day.

To sum it up nobody came that night.

 Chris as his family arrived really late so l understood but l found out jen spoke with my parents and wanted to suprise me but never came. The whole day she texted with them about how she wanted to come and than kept postponing and in the end never came(l know she wasnt busy as my dad met her by the pool with her mom and the whole day she posted photos on her insta on just chilling alone at home).

The 5th came and around 40 people were at my house. I have a big family and this was the closest family on my moms side only but it was still a lot of people. I got dressed up and chatted with everyone the whole evening while my parents were in charge of food and drinks. I had a blast. I usually never was center of attention and didnt like being one as it made me feel awkward but this time l really had a nice time.

Jen, Jay and Chris were sitting at the same table as with me and a few more of my cousins. Jens boyfriend(of 8 months) was also there as l told her he was invited. I knew she wanged to introduce him to the rest of the family and l didnt mind. She was so happy he could come and he seemed like a nice guy aswell.

Later that evening a family friend(really close to me but not to jen) came over and congratulated jen her birthday. One of our cousins also congratulated her her birthday and apologized saying she didnt know it was today. To wich Jen replied ""well somebody always has to steal my day"" and "" well it is (me)'s day but its still more my day lm just that generous"". I was chatting with someone else at the time but still heard it and said nothing while Chris who overheard was in shock and you could see him staring at Jen wide eyed.

It wasnt new to him that Jen would say something like this as we talk about her behaviour somtimes. She is always absent and doesnt hang out or speak with us much unless she wants something from us or its a family event and shes puttting on a facade(Chrises family is a bit rich compared to us and they live in a country with way better salaries,economy ect..). Later that day when they were leaving late in the eveining l handed her her gift that l told her was from me and Chris(he didnt really want to spend money on her but realised he didnt have a gift. He acompanied me shopping so l was aware and he just threw in a couple of little stuff like a chapstick,moisturiser ect... l told him we would tell her we both got it for her and it wasnt a big deal to me to share my idea for the gift).

Chris stayed later as his mom and my mom are really close and when they travel like this they end up talking till late hours. Me and chris became the same and sometimes it pains me to say lm much closer to him ,my younger cousin who lives more than 2000 km away, than my cousin Jen who lives less than 2 minutes away. I probubly see him more often than l see jen.

I spent that night chatting with Chris who was honestly the person l could tell anything and everything to. He spent maybe an hour lecturing me as he did when we went shopping about how l should stop putting so much effort into Jen when she never put any effort in me.

I have no idea what to do anymore. Theres honestly so many situations l could talk about but this is already a long post and l tried making it as short as possible.

AITA for celebrating my birthday on her day? I still feel gultiy and l dont know how to act around her sometimes.

1lyr39n,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1lyr39n/heard_but_not_seen/,Heard But Not Seen,"Dina had a quiet face. Her eyes were small and slightly too close together. Her plain, shoulder-length hair was cut simply. She had an overlong, pendulous nose. More generally, she was quite short and had been described as “frumpy” her entire life. The only thing she really liked about herself were her long, spidery fingers, which could play most brass instruments expertly.

But on-the-whole she was entirely forgettable – and had felt that way her entire life.

One of her colleague’s, Dave, exemplified this logic. For the entire time they’d worked together, even after their ill-fated *fling*, he’d called her “Diane”.

“My name’s Dina,” she’d asserted at first. Though more recently, she’d begun correcting him through gritted teeth. If he acknowledged these exchanges at all, Dave would simply grunt or hand-wave his mistake away – making Dina’s blood boil.

*It doesn’t matter,* she told herself, mindful that Dave was one of her superiors.

But it still hurt.

A thing which made this infinitely more galling was they both lived in the *same* village. They took the same trains. Queued at the same coffee shops. And while not exactly neighbours, there had been a few occasions recently where they’d bumped into one another at various village events – and each time, Dave had looked at her as if she didn’t exist. Like he could see right through her, *except* when she was onstage.

Dina, who often liked to practice in the quiet of the woods, watched as Dave approached with his wife one evening, their little dog scampering about in the shady green light. Dina rested her clarinet in her lap.

“Hi Dave,” she smiled civilly as they passed, but Dave barely even shrugged in reply. Dina felt suddenly vengeful – like she might explode with anger. Waiting until Dave was out of earshot, she aimed her clarinet at the canopy of trees overhead and blew into it violently, scaring a nearby raven to flight.

Dave’s dog barked too.

*Fucking Dave!*

There had to be a way to make him see her. *Really* see her. Dina watched the raven return to its perch, somewhat nervously.

In a few weeks it would be the village’s *Prom in the Park*, which everyone attended. There, she would be onstage, for once the centre of attention.

She picked up a pine needle.

It was perfect.

\*

On the day of the Prom, Dina watched Dave and his family arrive from her onstage vantage.

She played beautifully, as well she’d ever played.

Throughout, Dave stared at her, aghast.

Afterwards, she approached him.

“You take the ones no one sees, don’t you?” Dina whispered in his ear, dropping the pine needle into his lap. “But I’m watching now…”

This time, she knew he’d heard her.

Onstage, the bandleader took the mic, his voice cracking with emotion.

“Thank you to everyone for attending the third – now annual – charity Prom for Dina McCleod, our beloved bandmember who went missing in 2021. We miss you everyday, Dina.”",3,1752408062.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

i (25f) work from home and my team is usually super chill. we have this little morning zoom call everyday to check in and it’s not very serious — like, ppl are always drinking coffee, some don’t even turn their cams on, it’s relaxed.

anyway. my bf (28m) had the day off and he was just laying on the couch being all cozy while i was running around tryna make myself look slightly alive before the meeting. we were joking earlier and i told him if i got through the day without crying over spreadsheets i wanted a “reward” and he was like “oh don’t worry, i gotchu 😏” — so yeah it was a lil flirty moment lol

fast forward, i’m in the zoom call, THINKING i’m muted (which i usually am), and i text him:

“if ur still on that couch when i finish this call i’m climbing on top of you and not stopping 😘”

except. yall.

i wasn’t muted.

not even a lil bit muted.

and i said the whole thing OUT LOUD. into the meeting. with like 9 coworkers and my manager sitting there.

there was just... silence. like full-on panic-level quiet. and then my manager goes:

“uhh \[my name\]... i think your mic is on…”

i was literally frozen. like my soul left my body. and i just straight up panicked and said:

“omg sorry!!! i was talking to my cat hahaha 😅”

except. I. don’t. even. have. a. cat.

idk why i said that omg. it was just the first thing my brain threw out to try and save me from imploding. it made no sense but it just HAPPENED.

my bf thought it was hilarious and was literally dying laughing on the couch while i was having a crisis. i haven’t unmuted myself since. i keep my cam off. i type in the chat like some mysterious cryptid who can never be seen or heard again 😭

anyway, some ppl have been kinda distant toward me since? like idk if they were uncomfortable or what. one of my friends said i should’ve just owned it and laughed it off instead of lying, and another said i shouldn’t have said anything like that in the first place cuz it was “super unprofessional.” which like… fair?? but also i legit didn’t know i wasn’t muted.

so now i’m stuck wondering:

AITA for accidentally saying something spicy in a work call and making it weird, and then trying to cover it by lying about a cat that doesn’t even exist??

or was it just like. a dumb panic moment that anyone could have had??

i rlly didn’t mean to make anyone uncomfortable, i just wanna know if i handled it badly or if people are overreacting. pls be nice my soul is fragile rn 🥲

At least i got this thought for next meeting - Next meeting, I pop on camera, eat cereal, and casually mention “oh btw guys, I got a new cat.” 😎🐱xddd",0,1752408056.0,AITAH,2,0.43,False

(Oddly enough, I haven’t seen them online yet, but my local shops sell them.) Each set has three 5 ml sized perfumes.

 

I was not at all surprised to find that the Triptych consists of Abiba, Betel, and Hungarian Fronds, since those already formed a distinctive set of three with their bottle designs that differ from other Lush perfumes. As for the other sets, some of the contents were what I would have expected for each theme, while some were a little more surprising.

 

Now, I’m curious to see what 3 existing Lush perfumes YOU would place in each of the other themed sets – Days, Night, Romance – and how much your ideas overlap with the actual contents that Lush put in them. If you’re not familiar with these gift sets yet, please write down your suggestions before looking at the spoilers below!

Days: >!Breath of God, Dear John, Grass!<

I mostly used the 2mg but would occasionally buy the 4mg or 8mg if the store was out of 2 mg. In May of this year I started having lightheaded and dizzy spells to the point I thought I was going to pass out, mostly at work. This would send me into a frenzy of anxiety / panic attacks. This all came to a head on June 11 when I went to the ER with really high blood pressure and heart palpitations. My blood pressure at the ER was 240/100. My normal blood pressure is 120/80. I had every test run on me and everything looked great. The doctors could not figure out what happened to me. I was reading my discharge instructions the next day and it said ""avoid caffeine, alcohol and nicotine"". So I cut out all of those immediately and immediately started feeling better. After a couple of weeks I started drinking coffee and alcohol again and still felt great. I had started reading this thread about how bad the nicotine pouches can be for your health so I quit those cold turkey and will never put another one in my mouth. The ER visit was the scariest time of my life. I have a 2 yr old daughter and a 5 yr old daughter and I literally thought I was dying. It's been a month and my blood pressure is back to normal, my resting heart rate is back to 50-60 where it was 80ish while on the pouches.

I, 20F, have just finished uni studying criminology (I have no idea what I want to do with it). Please, don't think of me as someone who went to uni to waste time. I know you're thinking: here we go another no ambition degenerate whos going to uni to 'figure things out'. I'll admit, I was pressured to go to uni as quickly as possible by my mum, I wasn't sure what I wanted to do at the time and didn't have time to think about it. I mean I finished college at 17/18 I had no clue what I wanted to be. So I chose something that interested me slightly. I didn't enjoy it, but I'm very glad I went. I'm still not sure what I would have done if the pressure was gone, but anyway I find great value in the experience itself.

I recently had a conversation with a really close friend of mine about how I want to switch jobs; I work in a coffee shop, it was basically just a job on the side while i was studying. Now that I've finished uni I told him I gave my resignation, it's time to move on and find something, for lack of a better word, proper. I moved out when I was 18 and have some money saved up so I can take some days off for myself to look for something, but being jobless really stresses me out. He kindly reminded me that I only have experience in hospitality work and that I shouldn't expect to jump straight into a path in my field of study, I was taken aback by this and said ""Yeah I know, I'm not really sure what I'm looking for yet but I'm trying to get out of hospitality"". He then compared my job to a job of a tesco worker (which is in no way a bad job but the way he said it was like he was putting me down). He said they get a lot of money and probably more than what i'm getting now. He suggested that I should maybe look for a job like that to ""gain experience""??? that just makes no sense? Why would I need experience in retail? He said something about an internship but honestly I don't even know what he was getting at.

I got angry and said I didn't ask for his advice. I told him that I found what he said, rude. He dismissed my feelings and said he didn't say anything that's rude, we were just having an 'adult conversation'. He eventually apologised after going back and forth and me saying 'I only need an apology'. He made me feel like I was crazy for thinking I could find a better job, completely discouraging and disrespecting my work and efforts I put in at uni.

In general I dont like when people give me advice which i didnt ask for, I dont know if this makes me a bad person but it makes me feel like they think they're better than me? Im at such a strange point in my life and always feel so overwhelmed and sometimes just need everyone to leave me alone. I worry constantly about my future, I want to do well and make the right choices, but I want to figure it out myself. When people step in it makes me feel like they don't trust my abilities. It's even worse that my older sister has an amazing job and people tell me I should ask her for advice. I'm always the weaker, younger one. But hopefully not forever.

1lyqz6g,https://www.reddit.com/r/sailing/comments/1lyqz6g/stupidity_overconfidence_and_my_fatherinlaw/,"Stupidity, Overconfidence… and My Father-in-Law.","I went sailing with my father-in-law for the first time. I had been sailing since I was 18 (I was 33 at the time), and my wife and her family had shared stories confirming that he had sailing experience too. He had recently purchased a 16-foot dinghy with an electric engine. It was October, on Lake Michigan. A beautiful fall day—sunny, with a good wind from the west, but chill. The boat was already in the water when I arrived, so I couldn’t inspect it out of the water, but I trusted him. I was also impatient to get going.

I checked the rigging, the sail, and a few other things. We started sailing around the mooring area to test the engine (which died after a few minutes) and other equipment. The mainsheet wasn’t working properly. At the time, I didn’t know many nautical terms in English (I had been in the U.S. for about a year and it was my first time sailing there), so I asked him what the ""main sheet"" was called. He replied, “A rope?” That should have been my first red flag. I pushed a little more, asking about boat terminology, and he became visibly frustrated. Since I had only been married to his daughter for a few months, I decided to back off.

Then he said, “Let’s sail to that island. It’s only three miles from here.” I initially said no. But after he insisted a couple more times, I gave in. I was at the tiller the entire time. About 10 minutes after we left the bay, he sent a few photos of me sailing to my wife. I was wearing a short-sleeve T-shirt—it was that nice of a day. But then I realized: the wind was actually pushing us away from shore. What I’d experienced earlier in the mooring area was probably wind circulation within the bay itself.

Soon we hit 2-3 foot waves. We were on a beam reach with full sails, but struggling to make any progress toward the island. That’s when I noticed the waterline was too low—I realized that we were probably taking on water. I decided we had to turn back. As I began the turn, I jibed, and at that exact moment a wave hit us on the windward side. The boat rolled and capsized.

I remember thinking: *Holy f\*\*k, we’re in real danger.*

We both ended up in the cold water, surrounded by floating gear. I managed to climb onto the keel and, after about a minute, flipped the boat upright. It was fully flooded—barely floating due to trapped air between the boat’s inner and outer layers.

I forgot to mention: my father-in-law has reduced mobility and is 6’3”, 220 lbs—not an easy person to lift. After some effort, I got him back into the swamped cockpit. We were both freezing, and I was already exhausted. We put on life jackets (he grabbed the smallest one, of course), and I started planning our next move. We were drifting between two islands. One was inhabited, but the wind was pushing us *away* from it. The far side of the lake was a long shot.

I tried sailing again, but within 30 seconds another wave capsized us. I flipped the boat again. Same story. The third time we flipped, I was so exhausted I just climbed onto the keel and stayed there. I started thinking: *Can I swim with him to shore?* It was far and dangerous. *Should I stay with the boat?* It was bright yellow and easy to spot. I remembered an article that said: *“Never leave your vessel unless it’s sinking”*

Eventually, I found the energy to flip the boat *one more time* and haul him back into the cockpit.

Then—miracle. My father-in-law had left his phone in a lifejacket pocket, and somehow, it was still working. Shaking, he called my wife. Thankfully, she picked up (she’s usually in meetings all day). In the calmest, most casual voice, he said, “We are in the water… please call someone.” I was stunned. We could capsize again any second, and this man was explaining things like he was ordering a coffee. I grabbed the phone and yelled in my native language: *“Call f\*\*king someone! Call the Coast Guard, the police, Jesus Christ—we’re f\*\*king dying here!”*

Right then, another wave hit us. We were in the water again.

At least 30 minutes had passed since the first capsize. I managed to climb onto the keel again, with my father-in-law still in the water. Now I had the phone. I called 911. The dispatcher said my wife had already contacted them, and help was on the way. (Later, I learned she’d called her mom first, unsure what to do—just 30 minutes earlier, she had received happy sailing photos from us. She also didn’t know that my father-in-law had been joking all week about needing the Coast Guard.) Minutes later, my father-in-law’s lips turned blue. First signs of hypothermia, he'd already spent at lest 20 minutes in the freezing water. That’s when I thought, *He’s going to die. How am I going to explain this to my wife?*

Then, a small boat appeared. We were the only other vessel on the lake. 

They saw me waving and came over. I jumped aboard. Bringing my father-in-law onboard was difficult; the boat was rocking hard and we risked injuring him. They turned around, and with the help of all three men, we pulled him in. We covered him with the boat’s cover and rushed toward what we thought was an uninhabited island. Turns out, one family lived there—a former Marine, his wife, and their kids.

The man said: “We need to stand him up and walk him. If he lies down, he could go into shock.” So we stripped him, covered him with blankets, and walked him around the dock. Eventually, we brought him to their house, gave him more blankets, and hot chocolate.

Meanwhile, my wife had reached the harbor. A small Coast Guard vessel had already gone out looking for us. An officer told her that locating the phone’s GPS was hard in those conditions. Then, over the radio:  


“We found the boat, but we can’t see them.”

  
My wife almost fainted.  


Then another message: “We’ve got them. They’re safe on the island.”

The Coast Guard picked us up and began treating my father-in-law. When we got back to the harbor, a small crowd was waiting, cheering the rescue team. I felt like an idiot.

I had put other people at risk because I didn’t take simple precautions. I’ve replayed that day a thousand times—going from blaming myself to blaming my father-in-law, to quitting sailing altogether, then slowly getting back into it with more caution.

I’ve also lost trust in my father-in-law. He’s a superficial person, and this wasn’t the only incident that showed me that. But sailing is a passion for me that I still cherish. I just treat it much more seriously now.

**Lessons learned:**

* **Trust, but verify.** Don’t assume someone knows what they’re doing just because they told you they already did it.
* **Always take safety precautions.** We didn’t tell anyone at the dock we were going out.
* **Check everything before you do somenthing.** I skipped key safety checks. Create or copy a check list
* **Listen to your gut.** If something feels off, stop.
* **Call for help early.** Don’t wait until it’s nearly too late.",8,1752407682.0,sailing,2,0.9,False

THAT WAS SO AFWUL - LIKE WHY IM SO UNLUCKY ALL THE TIME :(((((

i (25f) work from home and my team is super chill. like, our morning meetings are half “project updates” and half us sending memes and complaining about coffee machines. i usually just wear a hoodie, throw in my airpods, and wander around my kitchen making breakfast while pretending to be a functioning adult.

that morning my bf (28m) had the day off and was just vibing on the couch like a little prince while i was trying not to scream at spreadsheets.

before the meeting started we were joking around and i said something like “if i get thru this day without crying i better get a reward” and he was like “oh i gotchu” 🫡 (yes, i know, we’re gross)

so i’m in the meeting, muted (or so i *thought*), and i get bored and decide to spice things up a bit and i TEXT him:

>

cut to: the entire team going silent

and then my manager — bless his awkward little soul — says:

>

me: 🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠🫠

i stared at the zoom screen like it had personally betrayed me. my bf is on the couch WHEEZING with laughter. i literally just stood there like. do i cry?? do i jump out the window??? do i fake my death and move to another country???

and then, because my brain was already in fight or flight mode, i go:

>

do i have a cat? no. i absolutely do not.

i have not spoken on mic since. i leave my camera off. if they ask me anything i just type in the chat like some silent victorian ghost girl who once embarrassed herself too hard to ever speak again.

**TL;DR:** sexted my bf during a zoom call thinking i was muted. i was very much not muted. entire team heard me say i was gonna climb on top of him. blamed it on a cat. i don’t have a cat. kill me.XDDD",0,1752406956.0,tifu,12,0.08,False

I told her that I trusted her and I dont trust the intention of other men, that was wrong. 
So the other night we showed together and I got out of the shower first. She had to finish up a bit, and Im having a smoke in the bathroom and a notification pops up on her phone saying "" I'm horny, and, you deserve a bigger dick"".

So I did, and I found that she recently took a bunch of new nude photo, and videos and she had sent them to 2 different people 2 days ago, she sent one on snapchat where she sent the stuff in the ""chat"" But her and this guy's snapped back and forth for a couple hours after, and the other one was off Instagram.

Have you now had any yet?"" "" why dont you go ask Keegan to make you some coffee, you think of him enough"" I responded and didn't say another word to her until well after the kids went to bed. 
I confronted her on everything I saw, the first thing she said was, "" I was never trying to hurt you, I just like teasing men online, but it's not like I was dating them or looking to replace you,"" hearing that it hurt, so i asked a few more questions and none of them she answered, but she said,"" I dont see what the big deal is, it's in the past and I've said I'm sorry nothing i can change now,"" I got up from the table and said "" what would you think if that's how I responded to you about cheating,"" and we haven't talked since then, she spent last night on the couch as I locked the bedroom door, just sucks knowing it's almost 5 years wasted, and I don't know if it's gone on through the whole 5 years or just something new ",2,1752406793.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I've been dealing with my bowel since my teen years mostly due to bad diet (lot of carbs) and crippling anxiety due to family issues. Diagnosed with ACID reflux due to Helicobacter pylori and multiple polips in esophagus at age of 16.

After a full round of antibiotics and PPI treatment ACID reflux losen his grip on my life but I had to take PPI due to low remission phases for years (stopped at age of 28-29). After long time of dealing with syndroms close to IBS I've learned to live with that and got used to.

Stool usually was consistant in it's shape and colour, without any food remains but was rather at irregullar times, sometimes even 3 times a day. About 2 years ago I've started changing my diet to contain less carbs, changed them to fruits, digested more protein based food (meats&fish, dairy, eggs, WHEY protein), I've ate more vegetables.

Year ago while doing some diagnostics I've found out that somewhere I've been infected by ascaris lubricoides. Got prescribed 4 rounds of Zentel to get rid of the worms, I've cut down carbs even more (no more cookies, snack to daily coffee). About 3-4 months after treatment I've started to have typical SIBO syndroms such as: bloating, feeling of fire in esophagus, stomach and bowels after eating anything, stool went even more irregullar in it's schedule with food remains within it, started feeling nauseus, anxiety started kicking in at weird times of day, even with regular sleep schedule 22-7 I've had issues with sleeping well, getting rest.

Done SIBO test (hydrogen and methane one) but the results were at most of 30 ppm of concentration in whole test length, blood work was ok, nothing in CT, stool clear of any parasites. Started with no FODMAP diet, felt a bit better, stick to it full month but the symptoms were still there. Started fito-treatment with berberine, allicin, oregano oil, immediately felt the die off symptoms, felt a bit better but still symptoms were there. After another 4 weeks with diet and fito-therapy got prescribed Xifaxan(rifaximin) for whole 14 days treatment. Stick to low FODMAP diet, felt great thru treatment and about 1-2 months after. Started introducing some products that were problematic without any issues. About month ago got a big flare up, started to feel bad. 

I've started to looking the cause elsewhere: found out that my atopic dermatitis that I have on my neck (thought it's related to parasites but didn't change at all) is related to casein, when I cut it started to fade out. Since my 20s I had problem with my neck, got stiff at times, painful after day/night. Started stimulating my vagus nerve which helps with my anxiety and being nauseus. But even with all that I have a very sensitive gut, sometimes same products that do not provide any symptoms cause flare up at other days. What am I missing? Looking for some help/path.

1lyqn1y,https://i.redd.it/ktejeap9omcf1.jpeg,Getting Around Portugal in 2025: Transport Tips for Tourists,"Hi r/VisitPortugalGuide! I just put together a blog post titled **“Getting Around Portugal in 2025: What Tourists Need to Know,”** and I wanted to share some of the key tips with you all directly 😃. As someone based in Lisbon and traveling around Portugal quite a bit, I’ve learned a few tricks about the local transport that can make a tourist’s life a lot easier.

No matter if you’re starting your journey in Lisbon, exploring the beaches of the Algarve, or hopping between historic cities like Porto and Coimbra, Portugal offers a bunch of ways to get around. But each option has its quirks and best uses. Here’s a quick rundown of the main ways to travel around Portugal, and who they’re best for:

* 🚆 **Trains:** Portugal’s train network (Comboios de Portugal) is a fantastic way to travel between cities. The trains are comfy, scenic, and pretty affordable (**Comboios de Portugal even offers early-bird discounts if you book Alfa Pendular tickets a bit in advance online or on their app**). I love relaxing on a train with a coffee while watching the countryside roll by. Trains are great for families (kids can stretch their legs) and budget travelers can score deals by booking early. Just note that trains mainly connect major towns and cities – if you’re planning to visit a smaller village off the main lines, you might need to hop on a bus or drive. *(Pro tip: If you’re doing the popular day trips from Lisbon to* ***Sintra*** *or* ***Cascais****, there are cheap, direct local trains to both – just try to avoid rush-hour commuter times because those can get packed!)*
* 🚌 **Buses:** For places that trains don’t reach, Portugal’s bus network is your friend. Long-distance coaches like Rede Expressos go almost everywhere and often cost even less than the train. It might take a bit longer, but buses are usually clean, comfortable, and have AC. If you’re a budget traveler or visiting a smaller town (think of those charming villages in Alentejo or the Douro region), buses will likely be the easiest way to get there without a car. One tip: you can check schedules and even book tickets using apps/websites (Rede Expressos has one, and services like Omio cover Portuguese routes) – no need to stand in line at the station. Also, Google Maps and the **Moovit** app are super handy for local bus schedules in the cities. 🚍
* 🚗 **Rental Cars:** Renting a car gives you the ultimate freedom to explore, especially if you want to venture into the countryside or do a cross-country road trip. I won’t lie, driving in Lisbon’s tiny old-town streets can be an adventure 😅 (watch out for those steep hills and vintage trams!), but highways in Portugal are modern and easy to navigate. A car is perfect if you’re traveling with family or a group of friends – you can make your own schedule, pull over for pictures, and reach remote beaches or mountain villages that buses or trains might not serve. Just keep in mind a few things: **tolls** – many highways have them (consider getting a Via Verde toll device with your rental to zip through toll booths), and **parking** – in historic city centers like Porto or Lisbon, parking can be scarce or expensive. I usually park outside the busy areas and use public transport or walk when exploring big cities. Also, automatic cars are fewer in supply, so book ahead if you need one. But overall, if you love a good road trip, Portugal is a joy to drive around (coastal road trips in the Algarve, anyone?).
* ✈️ **Domestic Flights:** Portugal is a small country, so you won’t typically need to fly between mainland cities – a train from Lisbon to Porto only takes \~3 hours, and even down to the Algarve it’s around 3-4 hours by train or bus. However, if you’re super short on time or planning to visit the **Azores or Madeira** islands, flights are the way to go. The national airline TAP and low-cost carriers like Ryanair connect Lisbon, Porto, and Faro, and also serve the islands (for example, Lisbon to Madeira is a quick 1.5-hour flight). Within the mainland, I personally prefer the train over flying (city-center to city-center is just more convenient than dealing with airports). But it’s good to know domestic flights exist as an option – sometimes you can find a cheap hop, say from Porto to the Algarve, if you want to skip a long drive. Just weigh it against the time you’d spend at the airport. For most travelers, I’d say plan on ground transport, but keep flights in mind if you’re doing a more far-flung itinerary.
* 🚕 **Ride-Sharing (Uber/Bolt):** In 2025, apps like Uber and Bolt are lifesavers for getting around cities and suburbs. They’re everywhere – Lisbon, Porto, the Algarve, even in many smaller towns. I always check **both apps** before ordering a ride; prices can fluctuate and I’ve noticed Bolt is often a bit cheaper for short trips around town. If you’re arriving at the airport with luggage, grabbing an Uber/Bolt can be way easier (and usually cheaper) than haggling with taxi drivers – plus you don’t have to worry about surprise fees or misunderstandings. For example, when I land in Lisbon, I open both apps and pick whichever has the shorter wait or lower price. Ride-shares are great for night outings (when buses/trains slow down) or anytime you want door-to-door convenience. And yes, payment is all in-app and tipping is optional (I do tip if the driver is especially helpful or friendly). One more local tip: if you’re staying in Lisbon, definitely grab a **Viva Viagem** transit card when you arrive (costs €0.50) – even if you plan to Uber around, you’ll likely use the metro or tram at some point, and that reloadable card covers all public transport in the city. Speaking of trams, the iconic **Tram 28** is a fun experience, but heads up that it’s usually packed with tourists and can be a pickpocket magnet. If you really want to ride it, try going early in the morning or late in the evening for a more mellow ride. Otherwise, there are other tram lines/routes that are less famous but equally charming and far less crowded. 😉

**Regional differences & updates:** One thing I love about Portugal is that each region has its own vibe, and that extends to transportation too. Big cities like **Lisbon and Porto** have solid public transit systems (Lisbon’s metro is cheap and efficient, and Porto has a handy light-rail metro and even some historic trams). In fact, Lisbon is currently expanding its metro (adding new stations like Estrela and Santos to create a circular line through downtown), and Porto recently opened a new metro line – so public transport is only getting better 🎉. In smaller towns, public transit can be a bit limited or slow, so keep an eye on schedules or consider renting a car for those areas. In the **Algarve**, for example, there is a regional train line along the coast and buses between towns, but to reach those secluded beaches or little villages, a car might save you a lot of time. And in the interior (say, the Alentejo or Douro regions), definitely plan ahead because buses might run just a couple times a day. Wherever you go, don’t underestimate how much you can explore **on foot** too – Portuguese towns are super walkable (wear comfy shoes for those cobbled streets and hills!). I often just stroll around to soak in the atmosphere, especially in older neighborhoods. It’s one of the best ways to discover hidden cafes, street art, and viewpoints that you’d miss on a bus or in a car.

I hope these tips give a good overview and help you feel more confident planning your travels around Portugal! If you want the nitty-gritty details, I cover all of this (with specific fares, apps, and route suggestions) in my full blog post.

So the monsoons are finally here — and honestly, I feel like this is one of the *most underrated* travel seasons in India and Southeast Asia. The roads are slick, the skies are moody, everything feels slower, greener, and somehow more alive.

I just got back from a short monsoon getaway to **Meghalaya**, and man — it felt like walking through a living painting. Waterfalls gushing, clouds rolling through the valleys, and the sound of rain on tin roofs... pure bliss.

Some other destinations I’ve either been to or have on my radar for the monsoon:

* **Coorg** – coffee, rain, and silence. Perfect.
* **Valley of Flowers (Uttarakhand)** – July-August is peak bloom. It’s magical, but needs a bit of a trek.
* **Munnar & Wayanad** – lush and peaceful if you avoid landslide-prone days
* **Vietnam (Ninh Binh & Hoi An)** – if you don’t mind some rain, it’s stunning, fewer tourists, and everything feels fresh

I know most people avoid travel during rains, but some of my best travel memories were with an umbrella in one hand and pakoras in the other 😄

Would love to know:

I am lonely and depressed, but I was happy throughout the dream. What happened? It was a wedding, and I was helping set up. Move on to the festivities, which were set in a cool little barnhouse/yard style wedding, and i was sitting alone at a table. I got smashed, adorably (talking about alcohol here queens), and it was just such a pleasant, unrealistic experience. I wasn't talking to anyone but I felt not scared of people for once. 

Where does the dysphoria from the flair come in? It was one really quick moment in the dream. I wanted to hop in on some girl talk but got rejected because I'm in this stupid body. It seems so silly but it was so profoundly sad in the dream I'm crying right now.

The rest of the dream for all you who like a story to be finished- I asked the mother of the bride (who owned the farm) if there was anything else she needed done. She said to change the sign from 'The Chelsey Chateau' to the '[insert brides new name here] chateau. I gasped and took the sign, while stumbling the whole way out. Caught up with my parents and sobered up a bit, but not enough because my dad smelt me (I hit him with a shoe and told him not to sniff me) and my mom gave me some coffee beans to chew on (nice ones). I then went to my car AND SLEPT it off. Not gonna drink and drive, like wut?out?

TLDR: Went to a dream wedding, got drunk and didn't talk to anyone, when I tried to I wasn't girl enough to join in girl talk, then slept in my car to avoid driving drunk. ",1,1752406126.0,MtF,0,1.0,False

I know this question has been asked a thousand times and will be asked a thousand more. But it's always relevant.
We visited Valencia last year and loved it! Thinking of moving here but I can't get current, relevant information through searching.
To the point - how much euros per month in net income is needed to have a normal life in Valencia for two people, while renting?
Our lifestyle is somewhat frugal and apart from the ocassional coffee outside we don't spend a lot on going out. I just need a number/range to get me started with the calculations. Have a lot of things to consider, but I won't bore you with irrelevant details.

Their undressed bodies intertwined on the leather couch. Her long legs wrapped around his waist. His hands tangled in her red hair. The cake for my birthday slipped from my numb fingers.......

Chapter 1

The weight of Elizabeth Walton's stare burrowed into my back like a drill bit as I crossed the ballroom. This gaze reminded me of five years of charity galas learned to detect the haunting silence of a mother-in-law who thought that one had failed at their most vital duty.



I clutched at my champagne glass and smiled one of those freaky smiles. The great ballroom of the Belmont Hotel glittered with New Jersey's elite diamonds sparkling light, suspended bubbles in crystal, and wealth practically oozing from walls. And there I stood, Aria Campbell Walton's dismal addition to the prestigious Walton dynasty.



""There you are."" Michael's warm hand found the small of my back, his touch spreading heat through the thin fabric of my emerald gown. ""I've been looking everywhere for you.""



""The host is fabulous, as always,"" I said into his sturdy frame when I was able to spare a few seconds for refuge. ""Just mingling.""



His jaw tightened almost to the point of inexpectation. An outsider wouldn't have noticed. After five years of marriage, I became somewhat fluent in reading what could be called 'the idioglossy of Michael Walton' micro-expressions.



""Don't let her get to you tonight,"" he hissed, his lips brushing my ear. ""This night is for the children's hospital, not family politics.""



I half laughed, ""The family political situation was the only thing that brought in half of these people for donations. Well, that and tax write-offs.""



Before Michael could respond, Elizabeth glided to us, her silver gown a luminous cloud of light reflecting off polished armor. Nelson followed two steps behind- the usual dance in the Walton marriage dynamic.



""Michael, darling."" Elizabeth air-kissed her son's cheeks, turning with far less warmth toward me. ""Aria. That dress is... loud.""



I resisted the urge to reach out and touch the emerald silk. ""Thank you, Elizabeth. The Children's Hope Foundation does wonderful work. We're honored to support it.""



""Indeed."" Her gaze drifted to my flat stomach, lingering there with pointed significance before returning to my face. ""The Gibsons just announced their daughter-in-law is expecting. Again. Their third grandchild in four years. Remarkable, isn't it?""



My chest constricted. I took a sip of champagne to hide the tremor in my hands.



Michael moved closer to me, his arm protectively around my waist. ""Mother. Not tonight.""



Elizabeth's eyebrows arched in skeptical perfection. ""I was merely making conversation, dear. Surely that's allowed?""



Nelson cleared his throat. ""The Masterson merger looks promising, Michael. We should discuss it in detail before the board meeting on Tuesday.""



""Sorry,"" he said, loosening his bowtie. ""She had no right.""



I gazed out at the manicured lawns. ""Five years, Michael. She's not wrong.""



He gently turned me to face him, his hands on my shoulders. ""Aria, look at me.""



I did. In the soft light, his eyes were the same blue as the late ocean sky, the blue that made me fall for him after knowing very well who his family was and what they expected.



""We'll get through this,"" he said. ""The treatments...""



""Aren't working."" My voice cracked. ""Four rounds of IVF, and nothing. I'm so tired of appointments and injections and disappointments.""



He pulled me against him, and I breathed in the smell of expensive cologne mixed with sandalwood in the air.



""Then we'll try something else. Or we won't. I didn't marry you for heirs, Aria. I married you because I love you.""



I wanted to believe him. God, I wanted to. But just last month, I had seen the way he had stared at his business partner's children, and that look mirrored my very own ache.



""Your mother will never forgive me if I can't give you children,"" I managed to whisper into his jacket.



Michael stroked my back in circles. ""My mother doesn't get a vote in our marriage.""



I let out a laugh. ""Have you met your mother? She thinks everything deserves her vote—especially when it comes to the Walton bloodline.""



""The pressure will fade soon, I swear."" He tipped up my chin, the dim light striking fear in his eyes. ""We'll face this together, just you and me against the world, remember?""



I nodded, not trusting my voice. Michael placed his lips against my forehead in a gentle kiss.



Past him, I could see Elizabeth through the ballroom windows. She was watching us, downing God alone knows what in that wine glass and giving nothing away. Behind her back, Jessica--my sister--would laugh betraying all semblance of restraint at whatever snippet of Nelson's humor made it that far.



The bizarrely intimate gesture jolted through me, working goosebumps along my spine.



""We should head home,"" I blurted out. ""I've had just about enough of this charity.""



Michael searched my face. ""Everything okay?""



No. Nothing was okay. Not having our shoulders weighed heavy with expectations, not that carsick feeling I had all night courtesy of my supposed failings, not that strange prickle on my skin at the sight of Jessica with my in-laws.



But I smiled up at Michael, the man I had sworn to love through everything, and told him, ""Oh, everything's fine. I'm just tired.""



As we walked through the throng with Michael leading the way toward the exit, Elizabeth came up just once more to intercept us.



""Leaving so soon?"" she asks, voice coated with honey and wielding a steel underpinning.



""Aria isn't feeling well,"" said Michael smoothly.



Elizabeth's gaze flicked to me- assessing. For a moment, absurdly, I wondered if she would ask whether it was morning sickness.



""Such a pity,"" she said, patting my arm while her fingers felt cold. ""Jessica has been asking for you. She has been so very useful for the foundation lately—such an excited young lady.""



The unspoken comparison lay between us, stark and awkward.



""I'll call her tomorrow,"" I told her.



""Please do,"" and the perfect smile of society came to Elizabeth's lips. ""The family should stick together, right?""



Michael was holding my hand over the center console, his thumb stroking my knuckles in comfort. I leaned my head against the window, gazing at the fast-blurring city lights as we drove toward our mansion.



""This pressure will soon be over,"" Michael said in a soft voice again in the darkness of the car. ""I promise.""



I closed my eyes, wishing I could trust him. But as we pulled into the estate, Elizabeth's words resounded the loudest in my mind.



\_Family should stick together.\_



I had no way of knowing just how soon that family would splinter—and that tomorrow, on my twenty-seventh birthday, I would learn just how empty Michael's promises truly were.



Chapter 2

Twenty-seven. That number ricochets through the hollow caverns of my mind while I rummage through those crammed plastic bags in my arms in search of my house keys. Not that I'm old but I'm not young, either, especially in Elizabeth Walton's utopia where women my age ought to have at least produced two heirs by now.



I shifted the weight of the birthday decorations to my hip and finally fished the keys from my purse. Silver and gold streamers peeked out from one bag, along with the custom cake topper I'd ordered weeks ago. Michael had been so consumed with the Masterson merger that I'd decided to handle my birthday celebration: a small and intimate dinner, just the two of us.



To connect back. After he had forgotten why we fell in love with each other, an infinite number of pregnancy checks and families became their close affairs.



The house was in silence upon entering my home, with sunlight cutting through tall windows creating elegant lines across the marble floor that echoed beneath my heels. Normally, I would expect to see Maria hovering in the entrance hall, bags in hand and ready to catch me up on all matters about the house. But today it was empty.



""Hello?"" My voice echoes under the high ceilings. ""Maria? Michael?""



Silence.



I placed the bags on the console table and took off my sunglasses. The wrapped gift for Michael vintage watch I'd had tracked down that matched the one his grandfather wore in the only photograph he kept of him- seemed heavy in my hand. A peace offering of sorts. It was a reminder that no matter what pressure or disappointments we faced, we were still Aria and Michael. Against the world.



Muffled voices echoed upstairs. Michael was home early. Perfect. Now I could surprise him, show him the decorations, maybe convince him to take the rest of the afternoon off...



I gathered my bags and headed upstairs, a light skip in my step. I approached the door to Michael's study, voices more distinct now. A man and a woman.



I froze, clenching the banister.



That laugh would be recognized anywhere.



Jessica.



My sister said she would come by the house to drop off some foundation documents for Elizabeth, but that was supposed to be yesterday. What was she doing here now? With Michael?



Another laugh, lower this time, more intimate. Something cold and slick uncoiled in my stomach.



The study door was cracked open, just an inch, just enough.



My feet carried me forward against their will, moving silently across the plush hallway carpet. Suddenly the shopping bags were feeling like a thousand pounds, dragging down my arms as though trying to hold me back.



Don't look. Go downstairs. Call out. Make noise.



But I could not stop. There was some horrible magnetic power drawing me toward the crack of light seeping from the half-closed door, and the unmistakable sounds coming with each step.



I pushed the door wide open.



Time splintered.



Sister. Husband. Naked bodies intertwined on the leather couch I have sat upon countless times, reading while Michael worked late. Her long legs, so like mine but not mine, wrapped around his waist. His hands tangled in her dark hair. Their bodies move in an ancient rhythm of betrayal.



The bags slipped from my numb fingers. The crash jolted them apart, Jessica meeting my gaze over Michael's shoulder.



No shock. No embarrassment. Just a cool appraisal, like I was an inconvenience rather than the wife whose life she was wrecking.



""Aria."" It sounded strange on her lips. As though she was trying it as a trial.



Michael spun around, face sucking palely as he scrambled to cover his nakedness. ""Jesus, Aria—""



Breath failed. The room spun, heaving the oxygen from my lungs. My lungs felt like they were on fire. My throat felt to be closing.



Jessica just lounged like the confident air she exuded into everything, lying in wait against the cushions of the couch as though she were on a beach.



""This is not what it looks like,"" Michael told her. It was the most pathetic lie in history coming from a spotted husband.



I felt a bubble of frantic laughter build in my chest. How could it be anything else?



""Happy birthday to me,"" I whispered words scraping my throat raw into forming syllables.



Jessica then beamed-the actual smile-as she finally reached for her castaway dress. ""He needed someone who could give him what he wants, Aria. Five years already and no sign of a baby? Their family needs an heir.""



So little air there was in the room, and the precision of that cruelty cut it from me. The room felt like it was spinning faster.



Michael was talking, stringing excuses like a toddler fumbling through broken English. My mind perhaps ever narrowed to the decorations scattered across the floor- the silver banner proclaiming ""Happy Birthday"" now draped obscenely across Jessica's discarded stiletto.



I backed away into the doorframe.



""Aria, please-"" Michael reached toward me, half-naked, face contorted into what looked like guilt but could not be guilt because it's a fairy tale. Guilt requires a conscience.



""Don't touch me."" Those words came from far away, someone too strong for me. Someone who certainly was not crushed under the weight of two betrayals.



I turned and ran. Down the sweeping staircase that had once made me feel like Cinderella entering the ball. Across the foyer Michael had carried me through five years ago, both of us laughing. Out onto the front porch, where sunlight poured in, dazzling me with its blatant cheerfulness.



I fumbled with my car keys, dropping them on the third attempt and managing to open the door. Mansion doors creaked open behind me.



""Aria, wait!""



I wouldn't look back. Couldn't. Because if I did, if I saw his face again, I would either shatter completely or, worse, I might listen to whatever lies he could come up with in the sixty seconds since I caught him in bed with my sister.



The engine purring loudly was a welcome sound. I reversed too quickly, screeching my tires all the way. Michael was in the driveway behind me, hastily dressed in wrinkled clothes, his hair brushed in tendrils by my sister's fingers.



Vision-blurred, I drove nowhere in particular-another way. Away from the mansion. Away from the vivid picture in my mind of Jessica's smug grin. Away from whatever was left of my so-called life.



I stopped at a red light, fumbled for my phone, and called the only person I could think of.



""Sam? It's me."" I broke my voice. ""I need somewhere to go.""



""Aria? What's wrong? You sound terrible.""



""My life is over, Sam,"" she sobbed as the first waves of tears came, hot and fast. ""I believed everything, and it was a lie.""



The light signaled me to cross. Horns blared behind me, but I could not move. Couldn't see through the deluge of tears.



""Where are you?"" Sam's voice sharpened with concern. ""I'm coming to get you.""



My phone buzzed with an incoming call. Michael's face flashed on the screen, the photo I'd taken of him last summer when we'd escaped to Cape May for a weekend, and his smile had been real then. Or had that been a lie too?



I declined the call.



""I'll text you the address,"" I managed. ""Please hurry.""



I pulled into a coffee shop parking lot and killed the engine. When I stopped moving, reality pummeled me with the suffocating wave of what had just happened. My phone lit up again. And again. And again. Calls from Michael. Texts filled my screen.



\*Please come home\*



\*It was a mistake\*



\*We need to talk\*



\*I love you\*



I shut the phone and pressed my forehead into the steering wheel, my body racked with sobs that felt like they could tear me apart from the inside.



My sister. My husband. The two people I trusted most in the world.



The betrayal was not just sexual; it was Jessica's words, piercing into the core of my most profound insecurity. Five years and still not a single baby.



Was it all this while? Did I exist merely to be the example of a poor incubator for the precious heir to Walton?



I stared through the windshield at strangers coming in and out of their lives all while mine lay in smoky ruins. A mother walked by with her wee daughter coming from a mall, both licking ice cream cones with not a hint of my disturbance meters away.



Here was a family I might never have.



No, a family I did not wish—a family I did not want with a man who could betray me so completely. Not with a sister who could smile while stabbing a knife into my heart.



I will not let them destroy me. I will be no other footnote in the illustrious history of the Walton family. I took a deep and shuddering breath, then wiped my face with trembling hands.



Twenty minutes later, when Samantha's car pulled into the lot, I was no longer crying. The hurt hadn't lessened had crystallized harder, sharper, and more dangerous.



""Whatever happened, we'll get over it,"" she said before moving on in a fierce hug when she took one glance at my face.



I pulled back, facing her concerned gaze with dry eyes.



""I'm filing for divorce,"" I said, like stones dropping into still water. ""I shall no longer be humiliated by them.""



I never told her about the strange relief concealed under the pain, like the weight of huge burdens slowly being lifted as I imagined walking away from the Walton expectations weighing down on me for half a decade.



I never told her about the cold, almost savage, release of every ounce of pent-up joy agitating in my heart in the knowledge that from that day on, I would never have to endure another one of Elizabeth Walton's pitying glances at yet another charitable function.



Not about the icy resolve that was now building in my heart, hardening upon my shattered heart like protective armor.



If Michael and the Waltons wanted war, then they shall have it.



But they will soon find out that they have gravely underestimated what Aria Campbell—formerly known as Walton—could do when pushed.



Chapter 3

The rain hammered against the window of Samantha's living room, which felt all too appropriate given the tempest inside me. My fingers shook, holding the mug of tea Sam had pressed into my hands twenty minutes earlier. It was cold. Just like my marriage.



""You haven't had much of your tea,"" Sam said, sliding onto the couch beside me. The cushion beneath her gave way.



I looked down at the amber liquid. ""Can't swallow the slightest?""



Again, my phone vibrated. Again, as if the twenty-six previous times hadn't been enough. Michael. I turned it face down.



""How long will you ignore him?"" Sam asked as she tucked back some dark hair.



""Forever sounds good right now."" My voice was hoarse and dry from all the crying.



Sam plucked the cold mug from my hands and set it on the coffee table with a sound that reverberated through the stillness of the apartment. ""He left six voicemails.""



""Delete them.""



""Don't you want to hear what he has to say?"" Sam said



I stood up from the couch; blood rushed to my head, and the room began to spin. ""What could he possibly say, Sam? 'Sorry I railed your sister on my desk? Oops, my bad?'""



Just then, the image of Michael naked with Jessica came flooding back. Her smug smile when she saw me standing there. The decorations are strewn across the floor. I was sick to my stomach.



""You need to eat something,"" Sam said, following me as I paced.



""I need to vomit."" I pressed my palm to my mouth. The bile rolled up, only to go back down again. ""God, Sam. My sister.""



My phone vibrated for a third time. This time, Jessica's name appeared.



""The nerve."" Sam snatched the phone before I could lay my hands on it. She read the screen and raised her eyebrows. ""She says, and I quote, 'We need to talk. Michael is distraught.'""



A bark of laughter escaped me. ""Distraught? He's distraught?"" I snatched the phone and threw it across the room. It hit the wall with a crack.



Sam didn't budge. She had seen me mad before, but not like this. Never broken.



""Have you called your mother yet?"" she asked.



""And tell her what? That Jessica is sleeping with my husband?"" The word 'husband' tasted bitter. ""She'll take Jessica's side. She always does.""



The front door of Sam's apartment was way too close, and the walls felt too tight soon. This is what five years of my life had been reduced to hiding out in my best friend's apartment while the rest of my world imploded.



""They're just Advil. For the headache, I know you have.""



Sam disappeared into the kitchen and returned with a glass of water and two pills. ""Take these.""



""Not sedatives.""



Then there was nothing to hear except the rain beating against the window. My socks were still wet from running through puddles to get to Sam's place. I had left everything behind clothes, my jewelry, my life.



""What happens now?"" Sam asked softly.



""I don't know."" My voice cracked. New tears burned my eyelids, but I blinked them back. Tired of crying. ""I can't go back there.""



""You are not going to. You'll remain in here as long as you need to."" Sam said



The vibration of my phone disappeared. The silence felt quite worse.



""I should have known."" The words scratched my throat. ""There were those late nights at the office. The sudden trips. The way Jessica always wanted to know how he was doing."" I dug my fingernails into my palms. ""I was so stupid.""



""Stop it."" Sam gripped my shoulders. ""This is not your fault.""



""His mom always hated me,"" I said, as the pieces started to click into place. ""Five years without bearing him an heir. Elizabeth probably pushed him right into Jessica.""



""The only person in this nightmare who is truly innocent is you,"" Sam said as he tightened his grip. ""What Michael did is his choice. What Jessica did is her choice.""



I slumped back on the couch, fatigue washing through me. ""And what am I going to do, Sam?""



""Tonight? You're going to sleep. Tomorrow, we'll try to figure it out.""



""I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see them together.""



Sam settled onto the couch beside me, spreading a blanket over both our laps. ""Well, then, we'll stay up all night, watching terrible movies, and eating ice cream.""



""I don't want ice cream. I want a lawyer.""



Sam's eyes squinted slightly. ""You're going to dissolve your marriage with him?""



""What else would I do?"" The question hung between us.



""I just thought... five years is a long time.""



""And it took five seconds to destroy it."" I picked at a loose thread on the blanket. ""My life is over, Sam. Everything I believed in was a lie.""



""You've already known,"" her voice firm, ""Your life isn't over. It's just changing direction.""



A humorless laugh escaped me. ""Some direction. 27 year old, soon-to-be-divorced, and nowhere to go.""



""You have me."" Sam squeezed my hand. ""And you have your design skills. Start your own business. Move to a new city. Reinvent yourself.""



Life without Michael seemed as frightening as liberating. For five long years, I'd been Aria Walton, the wife of billionaire Michael Walton. Who will I be now?



""You can stay here as long as you need,"" Sam repeated. ""What are you going to do next?""



I stared at the rain streaking down the window, a strange calm settling over me. The shock was wearing off, leaving something harder in its place.



""I'm filing for divorce,"" I said, the words solidifying my resolve. ""I won't let them humiliate me anymore.""



Sam nodded, a fierce pride in her eyes. ""I'll help you find the best divorce attorney in New Jersey.""



""I'll need one."" My voice became stronger now. ""The Waltons never lose.""



""There's always a first time.""



My phone buzzed, having fallen onto the floor. The screen cracked, but I could still read Michael's message: \*Please come home. We need to talk. I can explain.\*

Until, I saw a sign really obvious, my wife came home at 2AM from a friend's ""Party"" drunk and her dress was worn from front to back. I had to investigate.

I have a friend group, just 4 of us, all of us went to the same High-School, college but went different career paths later. One of them is a Security Researcher at a big corporate firm(John), another one a PI(Sam) and the last one owns a tech startup with a decent value(George) at last, Me, I run a Real Estate business started by me and my dad.

So, since I had a friend who is a Private Investigator, I had him investigate my wife. He found her entering a house near the city multiple times a week, while I am in my office and my son's at school. He told me about it, and with the help of Sam, he instructed me to break her charging brick and replace it with the one he gave. I didn't know what it was but he got into her phone which I was skeptical of at first.

One night, last September, he called me at 10PM for an urgent visit to his house. John was there too, with a laptop on his coffee table. He handed me the beer and showed me the screenshots Sam got. Took me a while to process, but I found out all the suspicions were true. What saddened me the most was, it was George who she was cheating with. 3 of us decided to isolate him, but not to arise any suspicion we found it out.

I have a Real Estate company, and a lot of land here in Kochi, Kerala. They value a lot. I feared that all of these land would be lost as alimony since my wife doesn't have a job. So, I liquidated all my assets here and invested in shares of companies in Dubai. Now, my real estate company has assets worth only maximum 50k Dollars. Nothing more.

She still doesn't know I have found out about her bad side, but I am keeping quiet till I have moved everything I have into UAE. Next month is my flight to UAE when I'll relocate my company and assets to different places there. She doesn't know much of it but knows I am going for a ""Business Trip"" unlike her ""Friend's Party"".

I just have my 2 friends with me, and my son who I might loose custody with. I haven't approached any lawyer, and my net worth in Kochi is just 100k Dollars along with my house there, which I am planning to giveaway to my brother who is going to get married.

At this point, she won't get much out of the alimony since she'll have get maximum 500 Dollars after I've relocated my assets, and I won't plan to confront until her parent's 50th wedding anniversary which is a grand event attended by 500+ people, which is after when I will have possibly moved everything I have so she won't get a dime.",3,1752406088.0,TrueOffMyChest,4,0.64,False

# Book 1: Chapter 1: Lily

Lily



My hands shake as I pack up my things from my desk.

I can feel eyes on me, but every time I look up, nobody’s glancing my way. I swallow and keep my head down. I’m sure everyone’s gossiping about why I’ve quit, but I won’t share. Not because I think the jerk who harassed me deserves to have his behavior swept under the rug, but because I don’t want any more trouble. HR wasn’t on my side, so I don’t know that anyone else would be either.

Once my box with my meager belongings is packed, I head out the door. There are a few confused glances as I leave, and a couple of people stare openly. I ignore all of them.

I can’t afford to leave this job. I desperately need the money. But I also need my sanity and my safety, and neither of those is guaranteed here anymore. I’ll just have to find something new. It’s not like I was saving lives or anything. I was answering customer service calls for a local delivery truck company. I can find another job like that easily.

This job is nothing, I repeat in my head as I walk out the door. I tuck my hair behind my ears—great, my hair clip fell out at some point and now I have no idea where it is—and try to project confidence and maybe a bit of a ‘fuck you’ attitude as I walk out.

These people don’t deserve to know that I’m upset. I don’t want any of them thinking that I’m leaving with my tail between my legs. I’m leaving in protest, and I’m going to find a better job, one that actually pays me enough to make rent and has a human relations department that takes care of its employees.

I get on the bus and head home. I have my car, which is a beat-up old Corolla, but it’s seen me through a lot of tough times, but I try to use public transport as much as I can to save money on gas. It means that it takes me twice as long to get to or from work sometimes, but when I’m struggling to buy groceries, a girl’s gotta do what a girl’s gotta do. I’m a little worried about my car, actually. It feels like it’s barely starting some days.

I really hope the old girl doesn’t crap out on me. I need my car.

The universe loves to laugh at me, though, so as I get to my apartment and I juggle the box in one hand and my keys in the other, who should grab the door for me, but none other than my landlord, Jerry.

“Hi, Jerry, thank you!” I put a smile on my face and pray internally that he won’t mention the rent.

“You’re welcome.” Jerry smiles. “I don’t suppose you’ve got an envelope of cash with my name on it in that box, do you?”

He mentioned the rent. I don’t know why I hoped for anything else.

“Not today, no.” I try to keep my tone light even as my heart rate skyrockets. Jerry’s been after me with rent for a couple of weeks now and I know that he has a point, I am late on my payments, but I also just want him to leave me alone and let me figure out what I’m going to do now that I don’t have any income.

Jerry frowns. “It’s past due, Lily. You know I like you, you’re a nice girl, but I’ve gotta put food on the table, same as everyone else.”

“Of course, Jerry, I know.”

“And I can’t do that when you’re late on rent. Again. How many times do we have to do this?”

“I know, I know, trust me, I don’t want to do this to you, it’s just—”

“There’s always something. Look, I can stop by later if…”

“Now’s really not a good time.”

“Well, when will it be a good time?”

I juggle my box and my purse as I try to head up the stairs. “Maybe on a day when I haven’t just lost my job?” I say desperately, annoyed and not thinking.

The moment the words slip out, I want to bang my head against the wall.

Jerry’s eyebrows shoot up. “Did you just say you lost your job?”

“I… yeah.” I don’t know what else to say. I definitely don’t want my landlord knowing the whole sordid story.

“What did you do?”

“I didn’t do anything!”

“Then how did you lose it?”

“I wasn’t fired,” I insist, as if the distinction will matter to him. “I quit!”

“Oh my god,” Jerry mutters.

I want the floor to swallow me up whole. “Look, it was a bad work environment, but it’s not like I was doing open heart surgery. I’ll get another job in a few days and get you the money. You don’t have to worry about a thing, Jerry, I promise.”

Jerry doesn’t look all that convinced. “That’s what you say every time, and every time, you’re late on the rent.”

“But I get it to you!” I point out, trying to be cheerful, then I dash up the stairs before he can say anything more.

I get up the three flights of narrow, rundown stairs to my tiny apartment, unlock the door, and get inside, sagging against the wall.

What a day.

It’s tempting to just sit here, maybe even cry a little, but I force myself to get up. There’s no use crying. Everything is going to be fine. I take deep breaths and lug the box into the apartment properly so I can unpack, wincing as I take in my run-down, tiny apartment.

This really isn’t a place worth pestering your tenants about rent over. It’s the size of a shoebox, there’s a leaky faucet, no air conditioning or heating, the floor is technically hardwood but only because it’s worn-down to bits, there’s plaster flaking off everywhere, and there are stains in the bathroom and kitchen that no amount of scrubbing and bleach can fix.

It’s beat up to hell, which is about how I feel right now, honestly. But it’s not like I can afford anywhere better right now. Especially now that I’m unemployed.

My phone rings and I jolt, picking it up. It’s Shay. “Hey!” I answer, trying to sound more cheerful than I actually feel. “What’s up?”

“Just wanted to remind you about the game tonight!” Shay sounds pumped up already, and oh my god, that’s right—I agreed to join her at a hockey game. She had the extra ticket because she dumped the boyfriend she was originally going with. But I could really use a night out after how the day’s gone.

“Yup, I’ll be there!”

“We’ll be meeting Maddie and the others there too. Don’t forget to bring something warm!”

“I won’t. Meet you then!”

Crap, now I have to get ready.

I heat up some beans and rice that I had leftover in the fridge and eat it while reading the new romance novel I got last weekend. Romance novels are the one thing I let myself splurge on, and I try to be careful about how many I buy. If I had the money, I’d buy every romance novel I could get my hands on, but unfortunately, I’m not that rich.

In the meantime, I eat my beans and rice and immerse myself in the fictional world between the pages. I love cooking and I try to get creative with my food when I can so that I don’t get bored, but I end up eating the same things pretty much every day because they’re cheap.

Someday, I tell myself. Someday I’ll be able to actually do what I want. I’ll be able to go to college, and experiment with food and cook delicious meals, and I’ll have a proper library for all my romance novels so they’re not in piles on the floor.

My alarm goes off, and I throw the dishes into the sink and run around getting ready.

Where is a damn hair clip?

I find a couple and put them in to hold my dark red hair back. I don’t know how I keep losing them, and yet I somehow manage to do it all the time.

I get ready just in time and hop into my car to drive to the hockey rink to meet everyone. I’m sure everybody else went out beforehand to eat, or will want to get drinks afterward, but I just can’t afford it. My Corolla splutters to life, and I wince as I pull her out of the parking space and head downtown.

“Just hold on a little longer, baby,” I tell her, patting her dashboard. The last thing I need is my car breaking down on me.

We putter and cough our way to the arena, where I park farther away so I can use free street parking rather than paying through the nose for the arena lots.

I’ve never been to a hockey game before. When I reach Shay, Maddie, and the others, some of them are wearing jerseys. Shay’s bouncing up and down on her heels with a huge grin on her face. “You’re just in time! Come on!”

Maddie buys a bunch of snacks that she ends up sharing with everyone, which is nice because I don’t have to be the one person who claims she doesn’t want anything to cover up the fact that I can’t afford to splurge. The ice rink arena is cold, but actually not quite as cold as I expected. Maybe it’s because there are so many people here, all that body heat warms the place up.

We take our seats, and the skaters come out to blaring music and spotlights. It’s a whole production, and I grin as the crowd gets pumped up on both sides. It’s a home game, so it’s mostly people in support of our home team, the Titans. I watch the players as they skate, trying to match the athletic figures with the faces they’re showing on the jumbotron screens.

Wow. Some of these guys are really handsome.

The first one out is the captain, Cruz Ashford. He’s got chocolate brown hair and blazing blue eyes, and he sweeps his gaze over the crowd and then the ice as he skates across the smooth surface with steady, even strokes of his legs. I don’t know if I’ve ever seen such a confident looking man in my life.

A few others come out, and another player catches my eye, apparently named Lawson Hunt. The player’s name flashes on the screen whenever that player emerges onto the ice. Lawson has dark blond hair and these mischievous brown eyes that complement each other, and a square jawline that gives a rugged edge to his handsomeness.

The last two out are a defenseman, Miles Eastwood, with the goalie Knox Monroe. Miles has black hair that seems to have hints of red when the lighting’s right, but that could just be my imagination, and his eyes are a true hazel. He gives the crowd a small, crooked smile, but then seems to focus on the goalie, who is—

Holy shit, he’s huge.

All the players are tall. Most of them look like they’re at least six feet. But this goalie is taller than all of them, and even though it could just be his extra padding for his job on the team, he looks broader than the others too. He’s got a beard that’s the same rich dark brown as his hair, which is shaggy. His eyes when he looks up into the camera are gunmetal gray, but he scowls at the crowd and then skates into position.

I guess the guy’s having a bad day. I hope that doesn’t reflect in how he plays. Shay gets riled up when her team loses.

I shouldn’t have worried. The moment the game starts, the players are in motion, and the four handsome ones that I noticed are the stars of the show. Not a single shot gets past the goalie, and the other three players are lightning fast, passing the puck back and forth like they’re reading each other’s minds.

By the time that the first intermission hits, I’m as into it as the others. It’s a lot of fun and exhilarating to watch everyone skate on the ice. It’s different from watching players in other sports running. Something about being on skates, and the ice, and how different it is, it just thrills me.

I’m up on my feet cheering with Shay and the others, and when we win, we jump up and down and Shay wraps her arms around my neck to scream in my ear.

Yeah, I’m really glad I came to this. I needed this.

Afterwards, everyone pours out of the arena, and the others start talking about going out for drinks. I wince. I’m glad that Maddie gave me some of her nachos and half of her pretzel. That was some delicious junk food, and it’s kept my stomach from growling, but now I really need to get home. I have to start job hunting tomorrow and I can’t afford to go out and buy expensive cocktails anyway.

“You coming, Lily?” Shay asks. She tugs playfully on my hair. “You lost a hair clip again.”

My hands fly up to my head. Damn it, this just keeps happening. “I don’t know how that happens.”

Everyone laughs, but not unkindly. “You can meet us there,” Maddie says. “Maybe you’ve got an extra in your car? I’ll text you the address.”

“No, no, I had a really long day and I need to be up early in the morning. You guys go on and have fun, okay? I’ll see you soon.” I hug Shay. “Thanks for the ticket. This was a really fun night.”

If anyone suspects I have another reason for bowing out, they don’t say anything, and everyone hugs me and then heads out of the arena doors.

I take a second to sit down on a bench, my stomach twisting. I don’t like lying to my friends. The thing is, I think if I told them I couldn’t afford it, one of them would’ve paid for my drinks. They’re good people that way.

I just couldn’t handle them knowing. They’d ask questions, and worry about me, and I can’t do that. Maybe it’s that I’ve been on my own for so long, or that if I have to tell my friends it makes my financial situation real, but the idea of them knowing about my late rent payments and my job loss just makes me want to throw up.

I wipe at my eyes and stand up, looking around. The arena’s pretty much emptied out. There are a few people talking to each other, and there’s a gaggle of girls in various tight, short outfits, some of them in jerseys they bought with the player names blazed on the back, giggling and apparently waiting for something.

Well, there’s no point in me hanging around. I need to get home and then pile the blankets up on my bed, since it’ll be freezing in my apartment.

I get outside and walk around the arena toward the back entrances. That’s over by where I parked, a few streets down from the employee parking lot. I keep my head down, my shoulders hunched, and shiver in spite of the heavy jacket I brought. I know it’s not really the cold. It’s the fear.

I hate not knowing what’s going to happen next, and I hate the increasing feeling that I’m drowning and can’t get my head above water.

My thoughts are interrupted as I bump into someone, hard.

“Oh shit!” I squeak.

I nearly fall over, reeling from the impact. It feels like I hit a massive wall of muscle, and as I blink and look up, I realize that’s exactly what happened.

The ruggedly handsome captain of the hockey team stares down at me. At this distance, his blue eyes are even more intense, and I can get a close-up look at his bulging biceps and powerful forearms, his strong, athletic build with his broad shoulders and trim waistline.

He’s also got what look like tattoos peeking out from the collar of his shirt and the bottom of his sleeves, stuff his padding and uniform covered up.

I swallow hard. I don’t think I’ve ever been in the presence of someone this goddamn handsome before, and I feel like I’m back to being a freshman in high school crushing on the senior boys. “Sorry, I wasn’t looking where I was going.”

The guy—Cruz Ashford, if I remember his name correctly—stares at me, squinting his eyes a little like he can see right through me if he tries hard enough. I catch a whiff of his scent. Roasted coffee beans, sweet coconut, and… the last one’s a bit hard to identify… buttercream.

Oh, god, it smells really fucking good. He smells really good. Like some kind of decadent cake at a fancy bakery, the kind you have a slice of at a wedding and then dream about for the rest of your life.

I may be a Beta, so scents don’t affect me as strongly as if I were an Omega, but oh my god, I want to bury my nose in him and inhale for days.

I swallow again and blink hard. I do not get gaga over a guy’s scent like this, especially not some stranger I’ve just bumped into. I hope nothing of what I was just thinking shows on my face, or I’ll look like a lunatic.

“Right. You weren’t looking where you were going.” Cruz arches an eyebrow to show how little he believes that statement. “You wouldn’t be the first puck bunny who tried to craft her own meet cute, you know. If you want an autograph, you can wait in the lobby like everyone else.”

“What are you talking about?” My temper flares a bit at his tone. “I’m not a puck bunny. I’ve never even been to a hockey game before tonight. If I’d known that the players were the kind of guys who assumed every woman alive was desperate to sleep with them, I would’ve just stayed home with a book instead of letting my friends drag me here.”

Cruz blinks, then looks like he’s trying hard not to laugh. “Definitely not a bunny. You’ve got claws.”

I fold my arms. “And you’ve got to be kidding me.”

Cruz actually grins at me, and my stomach does an inconvenient flip. “Hey now, sunshine, no need to keep taking swipes at me.”

“Sunshine?”

“Well, clearly, given the attitude.” The man actually winks at me.

He’s lucky his handsome. And charming. “I have to go. Excuse me.”

I walk around him and start to head to my car again, but Cruz calls after me, “So, how’d you like your first hockey game?”

I think about that for a second. Cruz isn’t wearing his jersey. He’s wearing a nice, fitted black suit and carrying a large bag with his gear. He might not know that I know who he is. But even if this is my first hockey game, you don’t forget a handsome face like that.

“The Titans were great. We were excited they won. But the captain needs to watch his offsides.”

I actually don’t know what ‘offside’ is, even though the refs called it a few times, but Shay told me that Cruz needed to watch his offsides after the second period, so I just hope she knew what she was talking about.

Cruz’s jaw drops, and he looks genuinely offended for a second before his face lights up with playful understanding. “Oh, she’s busting out the real jokes now.”

“You bet I am. Always save the best for last.” I smirk at him and turn away to walk to my car.

“Please don’t take my sunshine away!” Cruz sing-songs at my retreating back.

I keep walking, but I can’t help the smile that spreads over my face, even when I bite my lip to try to force it to stop. A fun time with friends, and a hot Alpha teasing me in a way that almost seemed flirtatious? Maybe this day hasn’t been so bad after all.

I know an Alpha wouldn’t really be happy with a Beta, or at least not just a Beta, in the long-term. But I don’t see the harm in a little fantastical daydreaming as I drive my poor struggling car back home.

My bubble is popped for good, though, when I get up to my apartment door and see the note left for me there:

You’ve got three days to move out or I’ll put your stuff on the street myself.

\~ Jerry

Everything feels like it’s crashing down around me, and tears spring into my eyes.

I’m being evicted.



# Book 1: Chapter 2: Cruz

Cruz



“Pick up the pace!” Coach Vaughn yells as we run through our drills.

I know he’s not talking to me. I’m the fastest one, leading the pack. Not just my pack of Knox, Miles, and Lawson, but the entire pack that is our team. I never settle for anything less than excellence from myself, and I hope I inspire that in the others we play with.

I pass the puck to Davis, going through the motions of the passing drill. I must fire the puck off with a little more power than I should for a morning drill, because my shoulder twinges.

I ignore it. It’s nothing, I’ve just gotta keep using it so that it just works itself out, like when your foot falls asleep and you have to walk on it again to get the feeling back into it. There’s no way I’m going to be the guy who went and complained to the team’s medical team because my shoulder twinged a couple of times.

The team depends on me. We all depend on each other—that’s the definition of a team. But I’m the damn captain. I have to set an example, and that example will never be ‘give up and complain.’

“Hustle, hustle!” Vaughn yells, clapping his hands.

I glide across the ice, stick handling the puck with finesse, taunting Miles and Jax as they backpedal to defend against my moves. I try to fake them out with a pass to Jax, but Miles, that sneaky bastard, sees right through it. He smirks, snatches the puck away from me, and swiftly dishes it off to a teammate down the line. Damn, he’s good.

Our practice is firing on all cylinders, with seamless drills and relentless intensity. We’re executing crisp passes, sharp turns, and bone-crushing checks. The sound of blades digging into the ice fills the air, mixing with the thuds of bodies colliding and the clashing of sticks. It’s a symphony of controlled chaos as we push ourselves to the limit, testing our skills and working to improve on the areas where we’ve been weak in previous games.

The energy on the ice is like an electric current, powered by the unbreakable bond we share as a team. We communicate without words, instinctively understanding each other’s movements and intentions.

When Coach Vaughn calls a break in the practice, I pause for a moment, sweat dripping down my forehead as I take in the practice arena around me. The ice is marked with the battle scars of our efforts, and I grin as I watch Lawson squeeze his water bottle into his mouth and then spit the water out onto the ice.

I fucking love this team.

They’re the reason why I lace up my skates every day, and why there’s no fucking way I can let myself get benched with an injury. I’m feeling damn good about our chances of taking the Stanley Cup this year, and I’m going to do whatever it takes for us to go all the way and win.

My shoulder twinges again when we line up to do our shooting drills at the net, but I ignore it. This just needs to be ignored and worked through.

After practice, Vaughn gives us one of his strategy talks.

“We’re doing well,” he reminds us. “But we can’t get complacent. We have to keep our heads in the game and not get distracted too early. The team that things they have it in the bag is always the team that fumbles it and leaves everyone wondering what went wrong come playoffs. And we’re not going to be that team, are we?”

“Hell no, Coach,” I call out, encouraging the others to join in.

“That’s damn right.” Vaughn nods at me with a grin. He knows he can count on me to keep the guys enthusiastic and focused, like a true Alpha. That’s part of why I’ve kept my shoulder issue to myself all season. Admitting to an injury—especially one that I can still play through at this point—would bring down the team, and I refuse to do anything to upset the great dynamic we’ve got going on at the moment.

We all pack up together, bantering and talking friendly shit, but out of all my teammates, only three join me on the walk to the car: my pack. Knox, Miles, and Lawson.

These three men are the most important people in my life. They’re my brothers in arms and my best friends.

“You four going to spend your evenings watching Bluey?” Jax teases us as we head out of the arena.

“You wish you had an excuse to watch Bluey,” Lawson shoots back. “Don’t worry, we’ll be sure to remind the Omegas in the area you’re interested in starting a pack—oh, wait, you scared them all off.”

“At least I tried,” Jax replies. “When was the last time you even struck out with an Omega, Hunt? Too busy changing diapers?”

“Ben’s too old for diapers.”

“I was talking about Ashford’s diapers.”

I flip Jax off with both hands, but I’m not really upset. That’s just how it is with our teammates, the typical chirping and locker room banter.

For all that Jax was teasing us, though, he is right about one thing: we are going home to see Ben. He’s Knox’s nephew, but ever since he came to live with us, he’s become our whole world.

Sure, we love going out and getting a couple beers, playing darts and pool, shooting the shit with pals as much as the next guy. We’re still adult men who like to hang out with other adults, after all.

But since Ben arrived… most of the time, we just want to be with him. None of us expected to be parents so soon, especially when we don’t even have an Omega yet, but it’s how life’s worked out, and while the circumstances of how Ben got to us hurt, I know we’re all grateful he’s in our lives.

The moment I open the front door, I have an armful of dog. “Winston!”

Winston barks and licks my face, slobbering all over me with happiness and excitement.

“I think someone needs a walk,” Miles notes.

“I think someone else needs a hug,” Knox says, crouching down right as Ben enters the room.

“Uncle Knox!” Ben runs for him and jumps into his arms, letting Knox hug him tightly.

“Were you good for Angelica?” Knox asks, standing and holding Ben up braced on his hips.

“He was,” Angelica confirms, hurrying into the foyer. “And I’m so sorry to cut and run, but…”

“No, no, we were late,” I reply, already digging into my wallet for the cash. “Here you go. Thank you so much.”

“Of course. Thank you. Bye, everyone. Bye, Ben!” Angelica waves and then she’s out the door, and Winston starts barking to get attention.

“I’ll take him for a walk,” Miles volunteers, already reaching for the leash that hangs by the front door.

“I’m hungry,” Ben declares. He rests his head on his uncle’s shoulder. “Sooooooo hungry.”

“Uh huh.” I grin, skeptical. “Let me guess, you’re hungry for Uncle Miles’s pancakes.”

“No,” Ben lies, badly.

“You can have some apples.” Knox carries him into the kitchen. “I’ll cut them up for you.”

I watch them go with a fond smile on my face. Ben is only three, and it was a serious adjustment for him to come and live with us after his mother died. I just hope that he understands how much we love him. We want to be there for him, but we can’t just let him do whatever he wants either. We need to give him discipline.

Lawson sighs and looks over at me. “Angelica’s schedule really doesn’t leave a lot of leeway.”

“I know, I know. We were late, though.”

“Not by much. It’s happened before and it’ll happen again.” Lawson shrugs. “I think we should consider something more… permanent. Like a nanny. Someone who can live here and take care of Ben no matter what’s going on with us.”

I jerk my head for Lawson to follow me and then head into the kitchen. “Knox, can we get your thoughts on this?”

“One sec.” Knox finishes cutting up the apple and then hands it to Ben, who’s sitting on his booster seat at the table. “Okay.”

“Lawson was wondering if we should find a permanent version of the… situation that just walked out the front door.” I hedge a little so that Ben doesn’t realize we’re talking about him. I don’t want him alarmed. He really likes Angelica.

Knox frowns and folds his arms. “You mean bringing someone into our home? Living here?”

“We need more structure,” I point out, tilting my head toward Ben. “And we can’t keep rotating babysitters. Today it was Angelica, then we have Mary, and Ophelia can do every other Saturday… we’ve had to find a lot of subs last minute.”

“And our schedule is only going to get more intense from here,” Lawson adds.

Knox blows out a breath. I know that he knows that we’re right. Knox is just stubborn and slow to trust. “I’ll think about it.”

“Good.” I walk over to the fridge and open it, then wince. “I’ll run to the store.”

With four athletes and one voracious toddler living in the house, we go through food faster than you can blink. I feel like one of us is running to get groceries every single day lately.

I clap Knox on the shoulder as I walk past him. “I know this is hard,” I say, my voice quiet. “But really think about it. We have to do what’s best for Ben, even if that’s something uncomfortable for us.”

Knox nods. I do finger-guns at Lawson just to see him roll his eyes and flip me off where Ben can’t see him, then I head out. Miles will be enjoying his outside time with Winston, I’m sure. Winston is a cheerful, adorable beagle mix, although we’re not sure what he’s mixed with since we adopted him from a shelter. He has black and white spots, and he’s bigger than the average beagle. We all adore him, but he and Miles share a special bond.

Miles is the quieter one of us, and I think he likes going on walks with Winston, because it lets him be out and about but alone with his thoughts and a sweet animal who won’t judge him if he voices those thoughts sometimes.

It hits me, sometimes, how damn domestic we are. We’ve got a big house that we bought when we decided to make our pack permanent. We have a dog. We’ve even got a kid, for crying out loud, although Ben wasn’t planned. The only thing missing is—

I cut that thought off before I can finish it. We’ve got the playoffs to focus on, and that’s what matters. And besides, I can’t even think about an Omega until we get Ben settled.

At the grocery store, I grab a cart and start loading up. We’ve had to add in a lot of food that kids like now that Ben’s living with us and I need to keep checking the list so I don’t forget anything.

Macaroni and cheese, right, and bread, peanut butter and jelly…

I head for the checkout, wincing a little when I get to the line with my full cart. I feel bad for the guy who does the bagging. Someone gets into line behind me, and I glance back. It’s a woman, with only a few items in her hands.

# Chapter 1 The Distance Between Us

Chapter One

Izzy

The Distance Between Us

I was the center of their world.

Not in a self-important way—no, it was more fragile than that. More sacred. Like they’d been waiting for me long before they ever knew my name.

When I was nine, the Richmonds chose me.

After a string of rejections, after being told I was too old, too quiet, too complicated, I was starting to believe the words written in my case file more than the girl staring back at me in the mirror. A foster kid no one wanted. Too much grief, too many questions, too few answers.

I still remember my mother—Bailey. She smelled like jasmine and wore her sadness behind a tired smile. She died when I was five. Cancer. My father followed not long after, his own demons swallowing him whole. I don’t remember much about him except for the anger. And then... nothing.

No aunts. No uncles. No soft hands reaching out. Just state custody and paper trails.

Then came Leo and Nora Richmond.

Leo was calm. Soft-spoken. He spoke to me like I was someone worthy of listening to. He had this way of looking at me like he saw me—even when I didn’t know who I was yet. And Nora... Nora was fire and silk. A defense attorney with razor-sharp wit, who gave the best hugs in the universe. She was fierce in her love, as if daring the world to try and take me from her.

I belonged to them. And they belonged to me.

They didn’t just adopt me—they rebuilt me.

I never once questioned it. Not when they tucked me in every night. Not when they showed up to every school recital, every scraped-knee emergency, every heartache and triumph. They were there. Always. And so, I gave them everything in return—obedience, success, gratitude. Love.

But no child understands the full cost of love. Not until much later.

As I got older, I started to feel the weight of it—their sacrifices, their pride, their unspoken hopes stitched into every conversation about the future. The pressure to be more than just okay. To make it all worth it.

It wasn’t resentment. It was… responsibility.

Then Carl walked in.

We met at a charity gala my mother dragged me to when I was in law school. He stood across the room like he belonged in another life—one filled with corner offices and impossible brilliance. He had this quiet intensity that caught me off guard. Not loud. Not charming. Just... aware.

He noticed things. Like the way I picked at my bracelet when I was anxious, or how my voice dropped when I was uncomfortable. It was unsettling. Intimate. And soon, inevitable.

Falling for him was like slipping underwater—scary, beautiful, and all-consuming.

He was everything I wasn’t allowed to want at the time—older, wildly accomplished, emotionally complex. But he saw me. Not the version I showed the world. Not the Richmonds’ perfect daughter. Just... Izzy.

We married three years ago in a garden that smelled like wild roses and champagne. My mother cried. My father gave Carl a handshake that lasted longer than most speeches. I believed it would last forever.

And maybe it still could.

But right now, it doesn’t feel that way.

Carl’s a cardiac surgeon. One of the best in the country. He’s always chasing the next miracle. And I’m a defense attorney, often fighting for people society has already condemned. Our worlds are heavy. And somewhere along the line, we stopped sharing the weight.

Most days, we’re like ghosts in our own home. Passing in hallways, kissing through yawns and paperwork. I live for the rare nights when we cook together, when his laugh lights up the kitchen, and he looks at me like he used to. But they’re getting fewer.

And the silence in between? It's starting to echo.

Tonight, I woke from an evening nap I don’t remember falling into. The apartment was quiet—too quiet.

The kind of quiet that doesn’t soothe you. The kind that makes you feel abandoned in your own life.

I wandered into the kitchen barefoot, poured myself a glass of wine, and stood by the floor-to-ceiling window of our penthouse. The city sparkled below like a promise I no longer trusted.

It was beautiful. But it didn’t feel mine.

Sometimes I wonder what life would’ve been like if I’d chosen differently. A simpler path. A quieter career. A partner who wasn’t half-married to his job. Maybe even no career at all. Just... peace. But I don’t think peace was ever written into my story.

I stared into the glass, the wine trembling in my hand. My reflection looked older than I felt. Tired in places makeup can’t fix.

And then—his voice.

“Dinner’s ready,” Carl called softly from the kitchen.

I blinked, turned away from the window, and tucked my thoughts into the quiet corners of my mind where I hide everything I’m not ready to face.

He was plating our meal, sleeves rolled up, jaw tight. A man used to saving lives but utterly helpless in the face of an unraveling marriage.

We sat. Ate. Talked about cases and clients and things that didn’t matter. The space between us felt like an ocean.

Finally, he set down his fork. His eyes met mine, and I felt the weight of the question before he even asked.

“Izzy, what’s going on with you?”

He said it gently, but his tone carried an edge of fear.

I opened my mouth—but the truth caught in my throat like a shard of glass. I couldn’t tell him. Not yet.

“I’m fine,” I whispered. “Just tired.”

He didn’t believe me. But he nodded anyway.

Later, we sat on the couch, bodies close, souls far apart. He scrolled through emails. I pretended to watch a show I couldn’t follow.

The clock ticked. The city blinked.

And something inside me splintered.

I knew it in my bones—this wasn’t just a rough patch. It was a reckoning. Something was coming. A truth too big to hide. A secret I’d buried too deep.

And I wasn’t sure if our love could survive it.



# Chapter 2 Shifting Silence

Chapter Two:

Shifting silence

Izzy

The quiet hum of the clock continued as the night went on, the seconds stretching between us like an endless chasm. I could feel Carl's presence beside me, but it was like we were both trapped in our own worlds, unable to bridge the gap that had formed between us, He shifted slightly as if he was going to say something, but he didn't, I didn't either, Maybe we were both too afraid of what might come out if we do.

I wish I could reach across the divide, and tell him what was really going on inside me, That it is not just the fatigue from long hours of work, or absence of time together that is eating me up, it is something deeper, something I have been avoiding for far too long, But how do I say it? How do I voice the things that have been buried so deeply inside me?

Carl's phone buzzed on the coffee table, breaking the stillness; he picked it up without a second thought, glancing at the screen. His expression tightened, and for a split second, I saw something flicker in his eyes, a look I couldn't quite place.

“Work?” I ask, trying to keep my tone light, but the curiosity is too much to mask.

“Yeah,” he replies, his voice flat. “I need to head in for an emergency case.”

I nodded, though the weight in my chest grew heavier. This is what our life has become. It was a cycle of him disappearing into the hospital and me staying behind, waiting for scraps of time we could share. The irony doesn’t escape me, he is a surgeon, dedicated to saving lives, but it feels like we’re both losing ours, bit by bit.

He stands up, gathering his things, and I stay seated on the couch, watching him, wondering if this is what we’ve become, two people existing in the same space, but living entirely separate lives.

“I’ll be back as soon as I can,” he says, his voice a little softer now, as though he’s trying to reconnect with something that’s slipping away between us. But the words feel hollow.

I forced a smile, though it didn’t reach my eyes. “Be safe.”

As the door closes behind him, I’m left in silence once again. It presses in on me, suffocating, as though the walls of this apartment are closing in. I stand up, pacing back and forth, trying to shake off the suffocating feeling. I’m used to this—the loneliness, the quiet. But tonight, it feels different. Tonight, it feels like a warning.

I grabbed my phone, staring at the blank screen, unsure of what to do with the sudden rush of emotions flooding me. I thought about calling someone Pat, my friend, maybe even my father, but I didn't. Instead, my finger hovers over the contact for Carl, the one person I should talk to, the one person who should understand. But I can’t bring myself to call him. I don’t know if he’d even answer.

I drop the phone back onto the counter and move to the window, staring down at the lights of the city once more. There’s a restless energy in me now, something that I can’t ignore. It’s like a storm brewing inside, and I don’t know if it’s about to break or if I can stop it.

And then, just as the weight of everything starts to feel unbearable, my phone rings. The number on the screen is unfamiliar, but something about it makes my pulse quicken. I hesitate for a moment before answering.

“Hello?” My voice sounds strange and distant, as if I’m speaking from somewhere far away.

“Izzy,” a voice says, and my breath catches in my throat.

It’s Carl. But it’s not the Carl I know. There’s something in his voice, something urgent, something that makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up.

“Izzy, I need to tell you something,” he says, and for a moment, I wonder if it’s just another call about work, another emergency that I’ll have to let go of. But then I hear it in his tone—the weight of his words, the gravity of whatever is about to happen.

And I’m not ready for what he says next.

“I’m sorry. I should have told you sooner. But there’s something I need us to talk about. Something that might change everything.”

My heart races, and suddenly, the silence in the apartment feels deafening. Something is about to shift again. And this time, I’m not sure that I can hold on.



# Chapter 3 Finding You Again

Chapter Three: Finding You Again

Izzy

Carl's words lingered in the air, heavy and unresolved, but something shifted between us, in that moment, it was like a crack formed in the shell that had surrounded us for months maybe even longer, The tension that had been building, unspoken, and unacknowledged, suddenly seems to have a voice, But before I could respond, Carl's voice was low and tensed, he called me back.

""Izzy, are you still there?""

I swallowed hard, my heart racing, There was a part of me that was afraid to push this moment forward, and afraid of what the truth or the turnout this might bring, but there was another part, the part I had been ignoring, the part that wanted to lean in, to trust him, to bridge the distance between us The loneliness I had been hiding behind started to feel more suffocating now, the desire for connection surging like an undeniable force.

“I’m here,” I replied, my voice barely above a whisper. “Carl… what are you trying to say?”

I heard him exhale, as though he had been holding his breath, and then a long silence follows. It was almost as if we were both searching for the right words, but neither of us knew exactly how to make this moment right. I could feel the weight of his hesitation through the phone, but it didn't scare me as much as it should have. Instead, I felt something else, something like hope.

“Izzy,” he said again, his voice more tender now. “I know we’ve been distant lately, but I don’t want you to think I’m not here. I… I just need you to know how much you mean to me.”

I closed my eyes, letting his words wash over me. For the first time in weeks, the distance between us didn’t feel insurmountable. I heard the honesty in his voice, and for the first time in so long, I felt seen.

“I know, Carl,” I replied, my heart opening a little more with every word. “I’ve felt it, too.”

There was a brief pause, and I could hear him moving as if he was stepping closer. My breath caught in my throat as the air between us changed again. There’s something else there now, something unspoken, but no longer unacknowledged.

“Izzy,” he murmured, and then I heard the faint sound of the door clicking shut, signaling his return home. The rustle of his jacket was discarded. Footsteps. The softest breath.

My chest tightened in anticipation.

“I need to see you,” Carl continued, his voice low and urgent. “Now.”

I didn't say anything, didn't question it. I just felt it in my bones, his need, my need. Without another word, I hung up the phone, my hands shaking slightly as I set it down on the counter. My heart thudded louder with each passing second as I made my way toward the door, toward him.

When I opened it, Carl was standing there, his face slightly flushed from the cold, his eyes dark with unspoken longing. He was looking at me like he hasn’t seen me in years, as though he has been waiting for this moment.

“Izzy,” he breathed, stepping inside before I even had a chance to say anything.

The moment the door clicks shut behind him, he was already pulling me close, his lips capturing mine in a slow kiss, deliberate like he’s savoring every second of it. It was like he was telling me everything he couldn’t say with words, and I let him—let him drown me in the warmth of his touch, the way his hands cradle my face like I might shatter if he didn’t hold me just right.

I felt his body press against mine, the heat of him, the urgency. There was a tension between us that’d been building for far too long, but now it was different; it was not just about desire; it was about connection, about remembering what it felt like to belong to someone and to be wanted in return.

His hands slipped down my back, pulling me closer, and I melted into him, feeling the strength of his body, the way his chest rose and fell beneath my fingertips. It was as though the world had narrowed down to just the two of us, and I was afraid to break this moment, afraid that if I pulled away, I’d lose something precious.

Carl pulled back just slightly, his forehead resting against mine, breath mingling with mine. “I’ve missed you, Izzy. I’ve missed this. Us.”

I didn't respond at first, just let the words sink in, feeling the weight of them settle deep in my chest. I’d missed him too. More than I’d been willing to admit.

“I’ve missed you too,” I whispered, the confession slipping out before I could stop it.

Without another word, Carl leaned down, capturing my lips in another kiss, but this time, it was deeper and more intimate. His hands moved to the hem of my shirt, lifting it slowly, as though giving me time to pull away if I needed to. But I didn’t. I lifted my arms, allowing him to undress me, feeling the cool air against my skin, but only for a moment before he was back, his hands warm against me, his body pressing into mine.

When he lifted me, I wrapped my legs around his waist instinctively, needing to be as close to him as possible. My heart raced in time with the rhythm of our movements as he carried me to the bedroom, not breaking the kiss even once, as though this moment was the only thing that mattered.

He laid me down gently on the bed, his hands tracing the curves of my body with such tenderness that I almost forgot how much we’d drifted apart. It’s like he was rediscovering me, and I was doing the same with him. His lips moved over my skin, soft and reverent, and for the first time in a long while, I let myself feel all the emotions I’d been burying, love, desire, longing, and something deeper.

When we finally came together, it was not rushed. It was slow, deliberate. Each touch, each movement is an unspoken promise, a reaffirmation that we were still here, still connected in the most intimate way possible. And in that moment, there was no space between us—no more distance, no more secrets. Just Carl and I, and the quiet, intense love we’d nearly lost, but had now found again.

And I knew, with absolute certainty, that this was the beginning of something new. Something that might heal the fractures, something that might put us back together again.



# Chapter 4 Steps Towards Us

Chapter Four

Izzy:

The morning light filtered through the blinds, soft and muted, casting gentle shadows across the room, I lay beside Carl, my head on his chest, feeling the steady rhythm of his heartbeat beneath my cheek, it was comforting, But there was heaviness, a question in the air that I couldn't ignore, last night had been...... something I hadn't expected, something I didn't know I needed until it happened, And now, lying here with him, I could feel that fragile thread between us, pulling me in one direction and pushing me away in another.

I wanted to stay in this moment, to forget everything else and just be with him. But my mind wouldn’t let me. It was too loud with all the things we hadn’t said. The things I didn’t know how to say.

His fingers brushed gently across my shoulder, and I shifted, realizing he was awake, I could feel the tension in him, too, he was thinking about something, I could always tell when he was lost in thought, it was like there was a wall

he put up, and no matter how close we were, there were still parts of him he kept hidden.

""Hey,"" Carl’s voice was low, rough from sleep.

""Hey,"" I replied, still feeling the lingering weight of everything we hadn't addressed. But at this moment, it felt like we didn’t need to talk about it just yet. It was enough that we were here, together.

He shifted slightly, looking down at me. ""I didn’t expect this,"" he murmured, his fingers tracing idle patterns on my arm. ""I didn’t expect to feel like this again.""

I closed my eyes, a part of me wanting to ignore the truth in his words. But I couldn’t. Not when it felt like everything between us was unraveling, slowly but surely. I had been trying to keep my distance, to protect myself, but being here with him, feeling his warmth against me, it was hard to ignore how much I had missed him.

""Me neither,"" I whispered, my voice barely audible. ""But I’m glad it’s happening.""

I could feel him stiffen a little, like he was waiting for me to say more. But I didn’t know what to say. I didn’t know if I was ready to say all the things that were building inside of me, the things I had been holding back for so long. And yet, there was something in his eyes that made me want to open up.

The silence between us stretched, thick and heavy. I could feel his breath on the top of my head, his chest rising and falling with every breath. It was like we were both waiting, but neither of us knew for what.

Then, I broke the silence.

“I don’t know what this means, Carl,” I said, my voice trembling ever so slightly. ""I don’t know where we go from here.""

I felt him tense, his muscles tightening under my fingertips. But he didn’t pull away. Instead, I felt his hands move to my face, lifting my chin gently so that I was looking into his eyes. He was searching my face like he was trying to find the right words.

“We take it one step at a time,” he said, his voice soft but firm. “We don’t have to figure it all out right now. Let’s just... be honest with each other. That’s a good place to start.”

His words hung in the air between us, and I let them sink in. I had to admit, it sounded like a reasonable plan. But could we really be honest with each other after everything? After the distance, the silence, the lies we’d both told ourselves?

I wanted to believe him. I wanted to believe that we could start fresh, that we could fix what had been broken. But the fear still lingered, gnawing at me from the inside.

“I can do that,” I whispered, my voice barely audible. “But I need to know you’re here. Not just... physically here, but emotionally. I need to know that you’re all in. I can’t keep doing this back-and-forth with you, Carl.”

I saw his expression shift, his brow furrowing slightly, but his hands remained gentle as he held me. His eyes softened, and I could see that this was hitting him harder than I had expected.

“I’m here,” he said, his voice thick with emotion. “I don’t know if I’ve ever been more here in my life. I was scared, Izzy. I was scared of losing you for good, and I didn’t know how to fix it. But I’m done with that. I’m here, and I’m not going anywhere.”

His words did something to me. They hit deep, cutting through the walls I was building around myself. I could see the truth in his eyes and feel the sincerity in his touch. It wasn’t the easy fix I’d been hoping for, but maybe it was a step in the right direction.

“I don’t know how long it’ll take,” I said, my voice quiet and steady. “But I’m willing to try. To figure it out. If you are.”

His gaze never wavered, and for the first time in a long while, I felt like we might actually have a chance. We weren’t perfect, we weren’t fixed, but maybe we didn’t need to be. Maybe we just needed to be here, with each other.

“I am,” he whispered, leaning down to kiss my forehead softly. “I’ll do whatever it takes.”

I nodded, my heart pounding in my chest. There was so much uncertainty, so many things left unsaid, but in that moment, I was willing to take a chance. To believe that we could rebuild, even if it meant starting over. Together.

Carl didn’t let go. Even after the words were said, after the weight began to lift—he just held me. And I let him. Maybe it was foolish, maybe it was dangerous, but it felt good. He felt good. His hands were warm against my back, and the way he breathed me in like he was afraid I’d vanish. I’d missed this—missed him—in ways I hadn’t even realized until now.

For a while, we stayed like that, tangled together in the silence. No words, just quiet breaths and the soft rise and fall of his chest against mine. His fingers gently brushed my spine, like he couldn’t stop touching me even if he tried. And I didn’t want him to.

“You’re still the most beautiful woman I’ve ever known,” he murmured into my hair, and I felt my heart flutter in my chest. “I don’t say it enough. I should’ve always said it more.”

I smiled against his skin, my eyes closing, allowing myself—for just a little while—to believe that maybe this could work. That maybe love wasn’t about having it all figured out, but about choosing to stay even when it was hard.

“I feel like I can breathe again,” I whispered.

Carl’s hand found mine under the sheets, lacing our fingers together. “Then let’s keep breathing. Together.”

I didn’t reply. I didn’t need to. My heart was speaking loud enough.

I nestled into him again, letting the warmth of his body and the softness of the moment wrap around me like a cocoon. I didn’t want to move. Didn’t want to think about what came next.

But the world never waited.

My phone buzzed again—this time louder, more insistent. A ringtone I couldn’t ignore.

Carl groaned beside me as I reached for it. I turned the screen over.

Incoming Call: MS ERIN

My heart sank.

“Of course,” I muttered, sitting up. “It’s my boss.”

Carl propped himself on his elbow, eyes narrowing a little. “Do you have to?”

I gave him a look. “It’s Ms. Erin. If I don’t answer, she wi’ll send a SWAT team to my apartment.”

Carl exhaled, clearly annoyed on my behalf but didn’t argue. I answered, clearing my throat as I stepped out of bed and paced toward the window.

“Hello?”



# Chapter 5 My Wedding Anniversary

Chapter five:

My Wedding Anniversary

It was our wedding anniversary day, and I was buzzing with excitement, I had told my Boss, Erin, that I’d be closing on time to see my husband at Saint Paul's, where he works, I quickly wrapped my work up, I was eager, desperate and even to surprise Carl,

Yesterday, our entanglement had been unforgettable, we had promised each other to sort things out, to open up, and to rebuild our trust. That conversation has lifted a weight off my shoulders.

I had picked out a small gift, nothing extravagant but something thoughtful, and a smile I couldn't wipe off my face. I couldn't wait to see him, to spend some quiet time together from work and from the world.

Immediately, I got out from my long drive. I held my little gift bag closely as I made my way to Carl's office, my heels clicking rhythmically on the cold, sterile floor; as I turned the corner, I saw one of the nurses, Nurse Leila, a friendly face which I recognized.

""Is Carl around?"", I asked, trying to keep my voice casual, but I couldn't hide the excitement.

"" He is probably in the call room,"" she replied with a smile.

I knew exactly where that was; I had been to that room more times than I could count, when we were newlyweds, to bring him a coffee or just to say hello. It was the place where I knew I could always find him anytime he was not in his office, and I was ready to share this moment with him.

Still smiling, I headed down the familiar hallway, my steps quickening with anticipation, The call room door was slightly ajar, and without thinking, I pushed it open, expecting to find Carl, maybe tired from his shift but always so glad to see me, But instead of finding him alone, my world came crashing down.

There, tangled in white sheets and in each other’s arms, were Carl and Dr. Eddie, one of our closest family friends.

Time froze.

My breath caught in my throat, and for a moment, I couldn’t move. I couldn’t process what my eyes were seeing. The gift bag slipped from my fingers, falling to the floor with a soft thud, but I barely heard it. My heart was racing, my pulse pounding in my ears, as the weight of the moment crushed me.

Tears welled up in my eyes before spilling over, hot and fast, as I turned and bolted. I didn’t think, I didn’t stop. I just ran, my legs carrying me away from that room, away from the betrayal, away from the life I thought I had and a life of new beginnings

I had no idea where I was going. My mind was a whirlwind of disbelief, of anger, of hurt. All I knew was I needed to get away from him, from this, from everything.

Hours later, I found myself in a dimly lit bar. The neon signs outside flickered as I stepped through the door, the smell of stale beer and cheap whiskey hanging in the air. I didn’t care. I needed to be anywhere but there.

The bartender glanced at me as I slid onto a barstool, my hands trembling as I wiped my tears, trying to pull myself together.

“Whiskey,” I croaked, my voice thick with emotion.

The bartender raised an eyebrow but didn’t ask questions. He poured the drink and slid it over to me. I picked it up, not caring that it was too strong, too bitter. I needed something to numb the ache in my chest.

I stared into the glass, my mind spinning. My hands shook, the cold of the glass grounding me as I tried to make sense of what had just happened. Carl and Eddie. How long has this been going on? How had I not seen it? How had I been so blind?

I knocked back the whiskey in one go, the burn not doing anything to dull the pain in my heart. The tears started again, falling silently as I fought to breathe through the suffocating weight of betrayal. My wedding anniversary was our third year, and this was how it ended.

How had we gotten here? How have I gotten here?

I didn’t know what to do, where to go, or how to face him. The Carl I had known, the one who promised to never hurt me, the one who swore he would always be there, was gone. All I was left with was a stranger who had broken my trust in the worst way possible.

Another drink was placed in front of me, and I didn’t ask for it. I just took it.

And for a brief, fleeting moment, I allowed myself to forget, as the warmth of the whiskey settled into my stomach, spreading a dull haze over my thoughts. The noise of the bar, the clink of glasses, the murmur of conversations all felt so distant, so irrelevant. The world around me continued, people living their lives, oblivious to the chaos I was drowning in.

My mind kept replaying the scene in the call room, the sight of Carl's face, the way he looked when he saw me, the surprise that crossed his features before it melted into something else, something guarded. Eddie's presence beside him only amplified the sting, the realization that I wasn’t just betrayed by my husband, but by someone I had trusted, someone who had been a part of our lives for so long.

I pushed the thoughts away, not wanting to face them, not wanting to process the magnitude of what had just happened. I reached for the second drink, taking a slow sip, letting the burn pull me back into the moment, into the numbness.

I could feel the ache in my chest, a deep, hollow emptiness that I knew would take time to fill if it ever would. But I couldn’t think about that right now. I couldn’t think about what I was going to do, how I was going to face him, or how I could ever trust him again.

The bartender eyed me carefully, his expression softening as he leaned over the counter. “You okay, sweetheart?” he asked, his voice low and gentle, as if he’d seen it all before.

I forced a smile, but I could feel how fake it was. “Just... just need a moment,” I muttered, my voice rough from the tears I had cried.

He nodded, and I appreciated his quiet understanding. He didn’t push, didn’t try to pry. Just let me be.

I took another sip of my drink, trying to focus on the taste, on the burn, on anything that could distract me from the whirlwind inside my mind. But nothing worked. The image of Carl and Eddie in that bed kept haunting me. The lies, the secrecy, the thought that I had been so sure of our love, was it all a lie? Had it been a lie from the start?

I heard the soft jingle of the bar door opening, followed by the shuffle of footsteps. I didn’t look up, but the sound of those footsteps grew closer and closer until they stopped beside me.",1,1752405899.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

Ah, the Norwegian football league—where dreams are born, losing streaks are *endured*, and Kasper Høgh’s first half against Sandefjord reads like a tragicomedy of “I scored four goals, but the universe erased them all.” Let’s dive into this delightful circus.  

**1. Brann vs. Viking:** Brann, still reeling from their 1-1 draw with HamKam, will face Viking, who’ve won 11 of their last 14 matches. Viking’s probably sipping champagne in their team bus while Brann sips lukewarm coffee, wondering if “bounce back” is even a thing anymore.  

**2. Haugesund vs. KFUM Oslo:** Haugesund is on a two-game losing streak, but KFUM Oslo has won two of three. KFUM’s probably whispering, “We’re the underdogs, but we’ve got *heart*,” while Haugesund’s manager is Googling “how to resurrect a team.”  

**3. Kristiansund vs. Sarpsborg 08:** Kristiansund’s riding a three-game unbeaten streak, but Sarpsborg 08 has won three of four. Both teams are probably texting their therapists.  

**4. Rosenborg vs. HamKam:** Rosenborg needs to end a four-game losing streak. HamKam’s lost three of four. This is like watching two drunkards in a dance-off—nobody wins, but the crowd eats it up.  

**5. Strømsgodset vs. Tromsø:** Strømsgodset’s on a *seven-game* losing streak. Tromsø’s won six of seven. Strømsgodset’s players might start wearing “We’re Not Dead Yet” T-shirts. Tromsø’s probably already drafting their parade route.  

**6. Lysekloster vs. Eik-Tønsberg:** Lysekloster’s four-game unbeaten streak vs. Eik-Tønsberg’s three losses in five. Eik-Tønsberg’s players might start chanting, “We’re just here for the snacks!”  

**7. Häcken vs. Halmstad:** Häcken’s six-game losing streak vs. Halmstad’s two wins in three. Häcken’s manager is probably plotting a heist to steal Halmstad’s playbook.  

**8. AIK vs. Degerfors:** AIK’s fresh off a 0-2 loss to Halmstad. Degerfors has lost three of four. This is football’s version of “Rock, Paper, Scissors” but with more expensive jerseys.  

**9. IFK Värnamo vs. Djurgården:** Värnamo’s on a *14-game* losing streak. Djurgården’s won three of five. Värnamo’s players might start betting on when their next win will happen—like a grim game of “How Long Until the Plague Ends?”  

**10. Women’s World Cup:** England vs. Wales (England’s expected to win big) and France vs. Netherlands (France’s the favorite). Wales, meanwhile, is probably still wondering why they’re in this tournament.  

**11. Club World Cup Final:** Chelsea vs. Paris Saint-Germain. Paris SG’s offense is “in top form,” but Chelsea’s won three of four. This is the football equivalent of “I’ll have the pizza, but also the salad.”  

**Bonus Chaos:**  
- Kasper Høgh of Bodø/Glimt scored four goals in the first half… all offside. He later converted a penalty. The referee must’ve been on a caffeine IV drip.  
- Guðrún Arnardóttur’s dad, Guðmundur Aðalsteinn Ásgeirsson, is *thrilled* with his step-daughter’s jersey number 18 (a tribute to his 2022 Manchester trip). “It’s a win tonight,” he said. Spoiler: It’s not.  
- Norway’s women’s team dodged Spain in the Euros, opting for Italy instead. Their reserve goalkeeper said, “A little relief… at least not yet.” Translation: “We’re terrified, but we’ll pretend we’re not.”  

**Final Verdict:** The Norwegian league is a dumpster fire of hope and despair, where teams like IFK Värnamo (14-game losing streak) are the modern-day gladiators.

1lyqcz8,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1lyqcz8/my_wife_sent_me_an_invite_on_wordfeud_she_died_in/,My wife sent me an invite on Wordfeud. She died in a car accident 2 weeks prior.,"I’m a nerd, I know. But after the death of my wife, it wasn’t about being a nerd anymore. It was about survival—mental survival. Something to do. Something to stop the tape from playing in my head every time I closed my eyes. It hurt so much after the fight. She took the Volkswagen Polo. Said she needed space. She didn’t come back. When I saw the news of a gigantic crash, my heart sunk.

That’s how I ended up back on Wordfeud.

I’d had the app since 2010, but I never played seriously until after Jennifer’s funeral. Now? I’m ranked 3494, with an average end score of 687. Highest-scoring word? *MASOCHISM*. 695 points. Kind of poetic, in a way.

I only play three people. My best friend Jack, who’s at 3450—he’s always less than 50 points behind me, and never shuts up about it. My son, Noah, ten years old, who begged me to teach him over the summer break. He wins about 15% of the time—because I let him. And my grandma, who’s been playing since before I was born, apparently. Her score’s 2532. She blindsides me with bingos from hell sometimes.

I win about 93% of the time overall. The numbers keep me grounded. Safe. Predictable.

Until three nights ago.

It was 22:03. I’d just stepped out of the shower, the towel still wrapped around my head like a sad little crown, when my phone buzzed.

Not a text. Not a notification. Just a Wordfeud invite.

The name made me freeze.

*Jennifer Masodiah.*

My wife’s full name.

We never used her full name—just Jen.

But that wasn’t even the worst part.

It had her profile picture. Not some random photo, her exact selfie she took two weeks before she died. In the kitchen, coffee mug in hand. I had that picture saved on my laptop, not anywhere online.

My heart slammed against my ribs like a prisoner banging on a cell door.

I tapped the profile.

Player score: 2954 Highest End: 1011 Best word: 193 Word with highest score: *DEALERS* (135) Longest word: *PHOTOGRAPHICS* Average end score: 694 Average play score: 32 Average word score: 29

Those were her real stats. We used to compare them while watching TV. I remembered every number.

I stared at the screen for what felt like an hour. My finger hovered over the red *Decline* button.

Then something darker pulled me in.

I hit *Accept.*

No welcome message. No emoji. No opening move. Just the empty board, waiting.

I hesitated, fingers trembling, then typed:

*Who the fuck is this?*

No reply.

I played a safe word. *WASHING*. 68 points. Neutral, predictable.

The account responded instantly.

*FUNERAL.* 45 points.

I swear, my hands shook so bad I nearly dropped the phone.

That couldn’t be a coincidence. It couldn’t. No one knew about that last conversation Jen and I had before she died. Nobody.

Not even Jack.

She was pissed I forgot to pack black socks for the funeral. She was obsessed with details.

I typed again, rage and confusion tangled in my voice:

*Motherfucker, who are you?*

Nothing.

I locked the phone and shoved it under my pillow like hiding it would stop the nightmare. Maple, our chocolate Labrador, jumped up beside me and curled against my leg. Her warm weight was the only thing keeping me tethered to reality.

Hours later, at 3:17 AM, my phone buzzed again.

I shot upright, eyes wild.

I grabbed it.

The Wordfeud app was open.

One move had been played while I was asleep.

*WATCHING* — 78 points.

I hadn’t even taken my turn yet.

My breath caught in my throat.

The screen wasn’t frozen.

It showed my name, my rack of letters, my move history.

But now it was my turn again.

*Jennifer Masodiah* had just gone twice.

And I hadn’t touched the board.

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted to the dark corner of the room.

Maple growled low, ears pinned back.

Then, from the silence, my phone buzzed again.

A message from Jennifer:

Until, I saw a sign really obvious, my wife came home at 2AM from a friend's ""Party"" drunk and her dress was worn from front to back. I had to investigate.

I have a friend group, just 4 of us, all of us went to the same High-School, college but went different career paths later. One of them is a Security Researcher at a big corporate firm(John), another one a PI(Sam) and the last one owns a tech startup with a decent value(George) at last, Me, I run a Real Estate business started by me and my dad.

So, since I had a friend who is a Private Investigator, I had him investigate my wife. He found her entering a house near the city multiple times a week, while I am in my office and my son's at school. He told me about it, and with the help of Sam, he instructed me to break her charging brick and replace it with the one he gave. I didn't know what it was but he got into her phone which I was skeptical of at first.

One night, last September, he called me at 10PM for an urgent visit to his house. John was there too, with a laptop on his coffee table. He handed me the beer and showed me the screenshots Sam got. Took me a while to process, but I found out all the suspicions were true. What saddened me the most was, it was George who she was cheating with. 3 of us decided to isolate him, but not to arise any suspicion we found it out.

I have a Real Estate company, and a lot of land here in Kochi, Kerala. They value a lot. I feared that all of these land would be lost as alimony since my wife doesn't have a job. So, I liquidated all my assets here and invested in shares of companies in Dubai. Now, my real estate company has assets worth only maximum 50k Dollars. Nothing more.

She still doesn't know I have found out about her bad side, but I am keeping quiet till I have moved everything I have into UAE. Next month is my flight to UAE when I'll relocate my company and assets to different places there. She doesn't know much of it but knows I am going for a ""Business Trip"" unlike her ""Friend's Party"".

I just have my 2 friends with me, and my son who I might loose custody with. I haven't approached any lawyer, and my net worth in Kochi is just 100k Dollars along with my house there, which I am planning to giveaway to my brother who is going to get married.

At this point, she won't get much out of the alimony since she'll have get maximum 500 Dollars after I've relocated my assets, and I won't plan to confront until her parent's 50th wedding anniversary which is a grand event attended by 500+ people, which is after when I will have possibly moved everything I have so she won't get a dime.",23,1752404713.0,survivinginfidelity,13,0.81,False
1lyq4bu,https://www.reddit.com/r/nes/comments/1lyq4bu/i_just_completed_the_first_final_fantasy_on/,I just completed the first Final Fantasy on original NES hardware,"￼​

Here are my thoughts:

JRPGs in 1987 were much less straightforward. So I used save states (with Everdrive N8) and guides. Most of the Final Fantasy key elements were already there.

No information about weapons and spells. Spells were not cast by spell-points but every level of spell has it's own amount. So you have to save points for each spell type. There's no way to refill those points except in towns and on the world map.

There was a printed map and guide. The beginning of the game was very well described, but in the middle of the game the guide ended. I have no idea how anyone could find some clues: How should I know I have to use a item called ""FLOATER"" in some random place that looks like a desert. How should I know I have to show an item called ""SLAB"" to some random guy in a random town.

The spells are absolutely intransparent, you need to find out what they do by try and error. You get 4 letter-names as only clue. About 20% of the spells don't work because of a bug. Yes, the game was very buggy.

Fights can be very frustrating. It can happen that your party is defeated by a stupid coincidence and you need to restart the whole level. Bosses can mostly be defeated in 1-3 turns.

Random battles take ages. Spells that affect every enemy are cast one after another. Every cast lasts around 5 seconds. This can make ONE single turn last multiple minutes. You can make a coffee in that time.

You can make your own party type. Choose between black mage, tief, ninja, withe mage and red mage. It's possible to screw up the game by the wrong selection.

Does anyone else have completed this game on the original NES. What are your thoughts?",5,1752404624.0,nes,5,1.0,False
1lyq2qc,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lyq2qc/aio_my_33m_gf_33f_went_out_for_a_night_of/,AIO My (33M) gf (33F) went out for a night of drinking with an old friend and took him home after to her appartment. I feel my trust in her is broken.,"Hi Reddit, apologize for the long story, not a native english speaker so I'll do my best, but I really have no one to fall back on with this on my mind.

This all started on a friday afternoon when my girlfriend sent me a text saying an old friend from middle school and university sent her a DM on instagram saying he's in town for just the day (he's on a week long Europe trip and had to be somewhere else the day after to catch a train ) he'd asked if she wanted to go for a coffee/drinks (gf and this friend both don't live in their native countries currently). Since she had to work during the day they agreed to meet up at a bar in the evening and the friend prolonged his visit for another day to accomodate this. I asked who this person was since in the year we've been together I've never heard of him and they hadn't communicated since we met or in the time before that. She assured me they were only friends and there was never any romance or feelings involved in the past.  
They proceeded to go to a bar in the evening not too far from my girlfriends house, they end up staying and reminiscing there and drinking till the early hours.  
Because of my initial concerns she told me to join them, but I couldn't as I'm in veterinary medicine and had a full weekend shift where I was on call at the clinic 24/7, which she knew about.

The day after I texted her asking if it was a late evening and she said yes, and she was feeling hungover. Me not liking the fact she was being drunk/drinking much with this friend, whom I don't know and haven't heard anything about, at a bar till the early hours I asked if they'd just stayed at the bar. At first she ignored the question and immediately replied with how one day earlier an ex bf that mentally abused her years ago suddenly tried to send a friendship request on instagram that she declined. Taken aback by this sudden twist, and wondering why she didn't tell me about that before, I repeated my initial question, to which she replied 'yes'. It raised suspicion with me so I then asked if she had shown him the appartment, since it was close by, she then said she did. I was unhappy with me having to repeat that question and getting sidetracked instead of her just being open and transparant about it all, it felt deceptive. She said it was just to show him where she lived and nothing happened or would ever happen. Since then things having taken a turn for the worse between us. She doesn't see why it's such a big deal meeting up with an old friend and I feel like my trust in her is damaged.

My girlfriend is very social and kind, she has a large friendship group consisting of mostly men and some girls, most live in her native country. Which means she only gets to visit them a few times a year. Others she texts with on an (in)frequent basis (life is busy, they all get that). This particular friend she's known for a long time, but contact watered down over the last years.

My main problem here is that I'm not comfortable with her going out drinking till the early hours till hungover and then inviting this friend I know nothing about (genuine intentions/looking for a hookup?) to her appartment after. I had to keep asking only to find out that they went to her place makes me unsure. I'm big on trust and I feel this situation has affected that. I have no objections with her going for coffee or drinks with male colleagues or male friends that she's known for a long time, who am I to come between that. But a message after years of no contact through instagram DM and everything after that is something I have a problem with.  
Also, she's had a horrible relationship with her parents since an early age. So the people who took on the parent role for her and whom she herself considers parents are the parents of her ex-boyfriend (with whom she told me she doesn't keep in contact). Her girl best friend that she visits a lot abroad is the sister of another ex-boyfriend she had. This is just to say, trust for me is something I really desire given that these ex-boyfriends are pretty well nit into her circle of friends and family. She also goes abroad a couple of times a year without me for a few weeks and visits all these male/female friends. I often can't join given my profession and work hours. This means I hardly get to meet any of them. She sleeps over at their houses (either single men/women) and has regular drinks with them whilst there. To which I have never made any objections.

Some backstory. The reason trust issues for me have worsened is because I've had bad experiences over the years.

1. When I was in my early twenties I was dating a girl for a few months with a lot of guy friends too. In those few months two of them tried to get with her as she'd told me and they admitted when I confronted them. I used to frequent pubs/bars and the attempts by these friends were all made within a setting of drinking and going out whilst I was absent.
2. I also experienced how men talk about female friends they have when it's just guys talking, and a fair few (not all) made no secret of the fact they would get with them if given the chance. This all made me very cynical towards men and their platonic relationships with female friends.
3. Another ex girlfriend had a guy best friend. I didn't even know he existed till 3 months into the relationship when she asked if it was ok they could have a drink together (similar situation where they were at the same place abroad) I was ofcourse fine with this, but unhappy I was never told about his existance if he ment that much to her. She would tell me in detail about the acne a friend of hers had on her back, but nothing about this man at all. So months pass by when her laptop was open on Whatsapp and I could see they'd been texting a lot. He was sending her love songs by James blunt and reminiscing about the times they'd look up at the stars together. She didn't react to those messages, but also neglected to set boundries towards him. Other than that it was mostly voice messages between them which I had no idea what they were about as they couldn't be played. When I asked if they were ever a thing she admitted that they kissed way back on a few occasions and tried as a couple (twice), but decided it wouldn't work, sex I was told was never in the picture. Cue me being annoyed that instead of a platonic relationship I find out months after that they were a bit more than that, which she never bothered to mention.
4. My best friend is a great guy, but when It comes towards women he's been an asshole. Cheated on both of his girlfriends and they proceeded to cheat on him. Again in settings of alcohol use and seeing eachother privately at home.
5. My other best friend cheated on his girlfriend whilst away on a conference, again on an afterparty with drinks involved. They're still together to this day, but she's admitted she doesn't look at him the same ever since.
6. The amount of cheating and infidelity I've seen in my direct environment is absurd, I'm talking neighbours, my niece, my uncle, acquaintances, work colleagues. I find it absolutely insane how much it happens.

Given all this, I've seen my girlfriend as a life partner and I love her very much. But now I find my trust broken, and I don't know if it can be fixed. With her having so many male friends and not seeing any problem with what has transpired makes me think I'm better off being by myself, to not put myself in a situation to be hurt again. I don't consider myself insecure. I take care of myself, relatively attractive, a good career and compassionate by nature. Ofcourse I have my flaws too, as does everyone. I just think I'm not naive about what people can be up to. My experiences led me to want boundaries between the interactions of women/male friends when in a commited relationship. But also the freedom for both parties to see and hang out with whoever they want. The way this transpired created reasons for me to mistrust one another and I feel opens the door to potential (mental and/or physical) infidelity. The both of us are having a talk later this week to talk about boundaries and see if we are compatible in that regard. And I'd like to share with her the points I outlined to show where my reaction stems from.

1lyq1nj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1lyq1nj/i_found_out_my_wife_has_been_cheating_its_been_a/,"I found out my wife has been cheating, it's been a few months.","I (42M) had suspected something off about her for almost 5 years for now, I saw obvious signs and dismissed it. Until, I saw a sign really obvious, my wife came home at 2AM from a friend's ""Party"" drunk and her dress was worn from front to back. I had to investigate.

I have a friend group, just 4 of us, all of us went to the same High-School, college but went different career paths later. One of them is a Security Researcher at a big corporate firm(John), another one a PI(Sam) and the last one owns a tech startup with a decent value(George) at last, Me, I run a Real Estate business started by me and my dad.

So, since I had a friend who is a Private Investigator, I had him investigate my wife. He found her entering a house near the city multiple times a week, while I am in my office and my son's at school. He told me about it, and with the help of Sam, he instructed me to break her charging brick and replace it with the one he gave. I didn't know what it was but he got into her phone which I was skeptical of at first. 

One night, last September, he called me at 10PM for an urgent visit to his house. John was there too, with a laptop on his coffee table. He handed me the beer and showed me the screenshots Sam got. Took me a while to process, but I found out all the suspicions were true. What saddened me the most was, it was George who she was cheating with. 3 of us decided to isolate him, but not to arise any suspicion we found it out. 

I have a Real Estate company, and a lot of land here in Kochi, Kerala. They value a lot. I feared that all of these land would be lost as alimony since my wife doesn't have a job. So, I liquidated all my assets here and invested in shares of companies in Dubai. Now, my real estate company has assets worth only maximum 50k Dollars. Nothing more. 

She still doesn't know I have found out about her bad side, but I am keeping quiet till I have moved everything I have into UAE. Next month is my flight to UAE when I'll relocate my company and assets to different places there. She doesn't know much of it but knows I am going for a ""Business Trip"" unlike her ""Friend's Party"". 

I just have my 2 friends with me, and my son who I might loose custody with. I haven't approached any lawyer, and my net worth in Kochi is just 100k Dollars along with my house there, which I am planning to giveaway to my brother who is going to get married.  


 At this point, she won't get much out of the alimony since she'll have get maximum 500 Dollars after I've relocated my assets, and I won't plan to confront until her parent's 50th wedding anniversary which is a grand event attended by 500+ people, which is after when I will have possibly moved everything I have so she won't get a dime.

1lyq0wa,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hyperhidrosis/comments/1lyq0wa/yet_another_potassium_no_more_sweating_post_salts/,Yet another Potassium = No more sweating post. Salts are the key.,"Just wanted to share that I too have effectively ""cured"" my HH by upping my salts, especially Potassium and Magnesium (and some calcium) intake and lowering my Sodium intake.

One thing to note that differs from the other posts is that I find that natural sourcing of K and Mg are much more effective than supplementing it. I'm talking potatoes, avocado, banana, kiwi, spinach, cantaloupe , etc. I do take a small amount of K and Mg supplements anyway though.

I also refrain from coffee, alchohol, spicy food or using herbs as I find that also increase my HH / anxiety. Fast food, also. I rarely eat out, cook myself, all organic, clean. 

I've gone to gym and do full HIIT workouts without my palms and soles sweating. Even if the rest of the body is drenched. The other thing I've noticed as a positive side effect is that by anxiety (especially morning anxiety) has gone down considerably. 

Negative effect I've noticed is dark circles under eyes. I'm assuming that's from an increase in the salt intake.

Got a medical checkup recently, from a cardiologist, all systems are good.


P.S. - Before the inevitable ""MD""s and arm chair medical experts (like they do in other threads) jump in, an adult should aim to consume 3,500–4,700 mg of K daily. That's almost 5g. Most of us are defficient in K and Mg anyways. Even if you go over a but (up to 6 grams) it's not a big deal, especially if most of it is from natural sources, but even if you supplement it. No one overdosed eating baked potatoes or spinach and avacados. I've consulted with my doc. So please stop fear mongering to feel self-important.  You'd need about  5.5 mEq/L of serium potassium levels before it becomes dangerous. That equates to around 30 GRAMS of Potassium Citrate supplement in an average healthy adult. Far below the 5g daily recommended intake.",13,1752404280.0,Hyperhidrosis,1,0.84,False

I (27f) and my girlfriend (28f) have been together for 3 years.

Every Saturday my girlfriend and her mom go out in the morning. Usually to get coffee, shop, farmers market, etc. This is something they have done for years and I love it for them, and allows me time to just chill and be at home.

Last week Saturday they went out at about 8am. I was still in bed. Later on about 10am I started my day, made myself my coffee and was lounging around in the living room. My girlfriend and her mom came up and walked right into the apartment. I was naked, which we both are always naked at home. (Her mom does not know this.) Never in 3 years has her mom come up after hanging out on a Saturday. When they came into the room I had gotten up to excuse myself and her mom came and gave me a hug. After I went to put clothes on and we chatted all for a bit.

When her mom left, my girlfriend got extremely angry with me about what had happened and wanted to push blame on me for what had happened. I never received any calls or texts about them coming back here together. Zero notice. . This is no different than any other day or time in our apartment.Her mom didn't seem overly concerned or weird about the situation, she was actually quite normal and nothing was different.

I don't think she cared We have barely spoken since and I'm truly at a loss on what to do and how to handle this situation any further.  We have taken some space away from each other this week and I plan on seeing her later this afternoon to talk things out.

1lypx9p,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1lypx9p/wedcuffed_life_wasnt_a_fairytale/,Wedcuffed | Life wasn't a fairytale.,"Life wasn't a fairytale. I learned that at five when Mom died, and again at twelve when Lisa, my step-mother moved in with her perfect daughter Chloe. At first, Lisa was kind to me, but soon she began showing her true, darker side. Chloe and I were the same age, but Lisa made sure that Chloe received all the attention from both her and my dad.

After a few months, I noticed how Dad started to ignore me as he got caught up in his ""perfect"" new family. Over time, I became just an extra, unwanted family member that no one cared about.

My only happy place was with my maternal grandparents, who lived in Italy. We made sure to visit each other whenever we could. Besides my grandparents, I loved only two other people in the world as much as my family—my childhood best friends, Jessica Martin and Adrian Parker. The three of us were inseparable until Adrian moved to a boarding school in London.

Jessica and I stayed close and kept in touch with Adrian every weekend. However, as soon as I started high school, Jessica began to ignore me, preferring to hang out with Chloe instead. Soon, they became best friends, and even Adrian stopped replying to my messages and calls.

As time passed, everyone around me seemed to compare me to Chloe or other girls. Lisa constantly insulted my looks and clothes and made sure others treated me the same way. Even my dad started to see me as a disgrace.

As little girls, we're often told stories of distressed damsels who need saving. But as I grew older, I realized I didn't need a Prince Charming to save me.

The only person capable of saving me was myself. I needed to become a strong, independent woman and stand up for myself.

I was clear about my future and goals by the time I finished high school. I worked hard to get into a top university, and my efforts paid off.

Five years later, Harvard's diploma gleamed on my wall. I'd traded starvation for strength, tears for titanium resolve. Even my reflection shocked me—waist-length hair, curves Ester swore made men trip, and eyes that no longer flinched.

Tomorrow, I'll be leaving Boston and returning to NYC after almost five years. During this time, neither my family nor Jessica or Adrian tried to contact me. My grandfather offered financial support, but I barely touched it.

As I packed my belongings and prepared for the airport, I tied my hair into a ponytail and examined my reflection in the mirror. My brown hair now cascaded down to my waist; I used to prefer short hair until high school. My round face was almost bare, with minimal makeup. My glasses were gone, and my hazel eyes, framed by thick lashes, were perfectly coated with mascara.

After taking one last look in the mirror, I grabbed my belongings and called a cab. Soon, I was on my way to the airport, hoping that everything would go well.

Little did I know, this journey back to NYC was going to turn my life upside down.

Chapter 2

It's been a week since I arrived in NYC. As soon as I landed in my birthplace, I got busy unpacking and setting up my home. This house was bought by my mother before she died. She wanted to keep it as a home, yet now, no family member is here with me today.

My family knew about my arrival, but no one had tried to meet me or contact me.

I brushed off those thoughts and continued sipping my coffee while sitting in the living room when I heard my phone ring.

I quickly stood up and grabbed the phone lying on the desk. A smile formed on my li-ps when I saw the name on the screen, and I answered the call.

""Hello, Grandpa! How are you? How is Grandma doing?""

""We're both fine, dear. How are you? Have you settled into your new home?"" he asked excitedly.

""Yes, Grandpa, I've settled in. I just wish you both were here with me,"" I replied, a bit sadly, making my grandpa chuckle.

""We'll be coming to visit you in a days, sweetheart. It's time I finally hand over the company to you,"" Grandpa said in a serious tone.

""Yes, Grandpa, I remember that. I just hope I can handle the responsibilities well.""

""You'll do great, my dear. You're perfect for leading the company,"" Grandpa assured me.

My grandpa, Stephen D'Amario never trusted my father—not after Mom died, and certainly not after he let Lisa and Chloe destroy what was left of our family. D’Amario Enterprises was Grandpa’s life’s work, meant for Mom, then for me. But after her cancer diagnosis, Dad took over, and Lisa made sure I’d never be fit to inherit it.

""You’re not university material,"" Dad sneered when I applied to colleges, parroting Lisa’s words. Yet I kept my grades up, clinging to one truth: the company would be mine at twenty-one.

The memories still clawed at me.

FLASHBACK

Jessica and Chloe barged into my room, their laughter sharp as knives. ""Ugly bit-ch,"" Jessica spat.

A book slammed into my face. Blood bloomed on my face. Then fists, nails, spit—each blow driving home my worthlessness. They destroyed my homework last, shredding it with glee.

""Know your place,"" Chloe hissed before slamming the door.

Alone, I sobbed, then rewrote the assignment until dawn. Weak. Pathetic.

FLASHBACK ENDS

I exhaled, flexing my hands—no longer trembling. At Harvard, I’d traded fear for fists. I even learned basic self-defence there.

Seeing how strong and decisive I am today gives me the confidence to take on the responsibility of being the heiress of D'Amario Enterprises.

Chapter 3

Adrian P.O.V

I've always gotten everything I wanted in life—from money to power, I had the finest of it all.

At 25, I'm one of the most successful businessmen in the country. Two years ago, my dad entrusted me with the full responsibility of the company, and today, it's one of the leading corporations in the USA. But the best part of my life is the love of my life, Jessica Martin. She's everything a man could ever ask for.

I've known Jessica since we were about 5 years old, but at 12, I moved to a boarding school in London. Despite the distance, Jessica and I always stayed in contact, and she supported me through every up and down.

During vacations, we always made sure to spend time together. I even remember Sarah, who used to be a good friend of ours. But after I moved to London, she started ignoring Jessica and even asked her to stay away from me. Jessica always told me how Sarah bullied her in high school.

As time went on, Jessica only grew more beautiful, both inside and out. Two years ago, after I took over the company, I asked her to be my girlfriend. With her, my life felt complete—she was not only pretty but also incredibly intelligent and talented. She was one of the top students in school and even got a scholarship to Harvard, but she chose to follow her pass-ion for modeling. Today, she's one of the highest-paid models in the industry.

My thoughts were interrupted by a knock on my office door. Without looking up, I told the person to come in.

I heard the click of heels on the floor and caught the familiar scent of perfume. Jessica walked towards me and sat on my desk.

""Good afternoon, love,"" I said, moving closer and taking her hands in mine.

""Hey, babe,"" she replied seductively, placing her other hand on my che-st.

""How was your day?"" I asked. She started telling me about her photoshoot that morning while I admired the beauty sitting before me. She looked amazing in that fitted white dress, her blond mid-length hair perfectly styled and falling onto her shoulders. As a model, she had a flawlessly toned body. She was perfect, and I was the luckiest man to have her in my life.

""Adrian, what are you wearing to your parents' wedding anniversary?""

""I want our outfits to coordinate since that's when you'll tell your parents about us,"" she said as she adjusted my tie.

""Well, you don't need to worry about that, love. My secretary has taken care of our outfits. You'll get the dress by tomorrow,"" I replied.

""Aww, thank you so much,"" she said happily. ""Now, if you're done with work, can we go home?""

""Sure, babe. Let me just call my secretary,"" I said, moving toward the phone to inform Josh of my departure.

I put on my coat, took Jessica's hand, and we interlocked our fingers as we walked toward the elevator.

I headed to my black Bugatti Veyron, opening the door for Jessica before jogging to the driver's seat. After starting the car, I soon stopped at a lavish Italian restaurant for dinner.

We chose a seat in the corner of the restaurant, and started discussing our future plans.

""Do you think your parents will accept our relationship?"" Jessica asked while sipping her wine.

""I don't think your mother is fond of me,"" she added as I narrowed my eyes.

""Why do you feel that way, Jess?""

""Ever since you came back from London, I've tried to talk to her, but she always ends up bringing up Sarah in the conversation.""

""She keeps telling me how sweet and kind Sarah is and how the three of us should hang out together like old times,"" Jessica said in a sad tone.

My jaw clenched at the mention of Sarah's name. What she did to Jessica was enough for me to hate her for the rest of my life.

""Sarah doesn't deserve to be our friend after what she did to you when I was gone. My mom doesn't know how ug-ly her true face is. Once she finds out, she'll stop talking about her,"" I replied angrily.

Even remembering how Sarah treated Jessica made my blood boil. Because of her, Jessica had to endure so many difficulties and traumas.

""Relax, babe. She's gone now. We don't have to worry about her,"" Jessica assured me, caressing my hand.

I smiled at her as the waiter brought our dinner. We ate while discussing the arrangements for my parents' anniversary party. Once we were done, I paid the bill, and we drove back to my penthouse.

I moved out of my parent's house two years ago and bought my place. After Jessica and I started dating, I asked her to move in with me. She's partially moved in, but she hasn't fully moved in yet.

As soon as we stepped into the penthouse, I slammed my li-ps against Jessica's. I grabbed her hair, causing her to tilt her head back, and I started kissing her neck hungrily, making her moan loudly.

Soon, we ended up on the couch. By this time, I had successfully removed her dress. She lay beneath me in her black lingerie, looking at me seductively as she started unbuttoning my shirt. Once she removed my shirt, followed by my pants, she took my member in her hand and began stroking it.

The room filled with our loud moans.

We ended up going for a second round and then showered together. Afterwards, we were so exhausted that we went straight to bed. I hugged her tightly in my arms, and soon, we both fell asleep.

Chapter 4

Adrian P.O.V

The past few days have been chaotic, as my parents' wedding anniversary is approaching. I've been busy with the arrangements for the party. It's also the day I plan to officially tell my parents about Jessica and my intention to marry her by the end of the year.

I even bought a ring for Jessica. If everything goes well, I'll propose to her at the party in front of everyone.

I looked up when I heard a knock on my office door and saw my father, James Parker, walking in with a serious expression.

""How are you, son? We hardly see you these days. Your mom misses you a lot,"" he said, sitting on the couch.

""I've just been caught up with work, Dad. I'll definitely visit Mom today,"" I replied while scanning some important files.

""I need to discuss something important with you. It's about the company."" I put my file down and turned to face him, waiting for him to continue.

""Since you've taken over the company, your mother and I think it's time for you to settle down. You'll be turning 26 this year, and we believe it's time for you to get married.""

Hearing this, I thought it was the perfect moment to tell him about Jessica, but before I could, he continued.

""We've decided you should marry the granddaughter of Stephen D'Amario. She's the heiress of the D'Amario family. Mr D'Amario was a close friend of your grandfather, so it would be a perfect match,"" my father revealed with a big smile.

I was in complete shock. I couldn't imagine marrying anyone other than Jessica.

""No, Dad, I don't want to marry anyone else. I've already decided what I want in life, and marrying some heiress isn't part of it,"" I said angrily.

""In that case, the company will be transferred to Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter. Your grandfather and Mr. D'Amario signed an agreement that you and his granddaughter must marry, allowing the Parker and D'Amario companies to merge for mutual benefit,"" he said calmly.

""I'm still not marrying her. To he-ll with this danm agreement!"" I snapped angrily.

""Oh, son, you must marry her. If you refuse, 40% of Parker Enterprises will go to her. If she refuses, 40% of D'Amario Enterprises will come to us. If you both refuse, 50% of each company's shares will go to charity,"" he explained.

I heaved a big sigh, annoyed and worried about how to explain this to Jessica. Every plan I made for us seemed to be crumbling.

""I'll leave now; your mother is probably waiting for me,"" he said, walking out of my office.

As I pondered this new problem, my phone rang. It was Jessica. I answered, and her sweet voice came through the line.

""Hey, babe! Are you still at the office? Did you forget about our date night at my place?"" she asked.

I had completely forgotten about the date night due to my busy schedule, but I quickly covered my negligence.

""Of course, love. I can't wait to see you,"" I said, smirking at the thought of holding her in my arms tonight.

""Alright, see you at 7 then. Bye, love you,"" she said.

""Love you too, babe."" I hung up and went back to thinking about how to handle this marriage situation. How would Jessica react?

I immediately called my best friend, Noah. He's the COO of Parker Enterprises. We met in boarding school, and we've been best friends ever since.

I picked up the intercom and called my secretary. ""Could you please ask Mr. Andrews to come to my office immediately?""

Within 10 minutes, Noah walked in. ""Hey, everything good?"" he asked as he sat down across from me.

""My father wants me to marry Mr. D'Amario's granddaughter, or else the company goes to charity.""

""What?! No way. We've worked so hard for the company these past two years. It would all be wasted if it goes to charity,"" Noah exclaimed. ""What about Jessica? Did you tell her?""

""Not yet, bro. I'm planning to tell her tonight,"" I replied, massaging my temples.

""Isn't D'Amario Enterprises owned by Neil Darrell?"" Noah asked.

I immediately realized he was right. ""If Neil Darrell is running D'Amario Enterprises, then the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry is Chloe Darrell,"" I said, connecting the dots.

""Exactly. You can talk to Jessica about this. She can easily convince Chloe to refuse the proposal since they're best friends,"" Noah suggested.

""That's what I was thinking. I need to get to Jessica's place now."" I quickly left the office and headed to Jessica's apartment.

I arrived and rang the bell. Within seconds, she opened the door. A smile formed on my face as I saw her. She wrapped her arms around my shoulders and kissed me. I kissed her back passionately. Soon, we were undressed and made our way to the bedroom. After hours of being together, we finally went downstairs for dinner.

I or-dered sushi since Jessica can barely cook. To be honest, she's a terrible cook—she can hardly boil water—but she's perfect in every other way, and she's all I want.

We finished dinner, talking about our day when I suddenly remembered the conversation with my dad.

""Babe, I need to tell you something important,"" I said, holding her hands close to my che-st.

I explained the entire situation, from the marriage proposal to the merger, and the consequences if we backed out.

Before I could tell her about Chloe, she snapped at me angrily, ""So you want to leave me and marry some random brat now?""

""No, babe, the only person I want to marry is you. I can't even think of marrying someone else,"" I reassured her.

""And this marriage won't happen. All you need to do is convince Chloe to refuse the proposal.""

""Chloe? What does she have to do with this proposal?"" she asked.

""She's the granddaughter I'm supposed to marry, and since she's your best friend, you can easily convince her to refuse,"" I explained.

A smile formed on her li-ps, and she hugged me tightly.

""That can be done easily. She's dating Justin now, so I doubt she'd ever want to marry you,"" she said happily.

""And I'll never marry or love anyone but you,"" I told her, pressing my kiss to her forehead.

Chapter 5

Sarah P.O.V

I felt tense and doomed after hearing what Grandpa and Grandma told me. They arrived in the States last night, and today they've given me the biggest shock of my life.

According to them, I must marry for the merger or lose a 40% share of Amario Enterprises. Before they could finish their next sentence, I slammed my hands on my lap and stood up.

""I can't accept this proposal, Grandpa. I just graduated, and right now, I want to explore new things. I don't want to get married so soon.""

""Sweetheart, we're not forcing you, but we want someone strong to take care of you. Grandpa and I are getting old, dear; we won't always be here to support you. That's why we want you to be secure and happy,"" Grandma said, making me sit down again as she held my hands.

I thought about everything happening. When it comes to marriage, love, respect, and trust are the pillars of happiness.

I've always been nervous about relationships, scared of rejection and being unloved.

I feared I'd be the one trying to maintain the relationship while the other person didn't care.

""Sarah, we always want what's best for you. But remember, if you reject this proposal, the company will be ruined. This company was your mother's dream. Sophia worked hard to bring it to where it is today. But honey, we don't want to force you,"" Grandpa said, comforting me.

Thinking about my mother, I wondered what she would do in my place. Would she accept this to save the company? She worked tirelessly until her illness confined her to bed.

""Grandpa, I need to think this over. I'll let you know my decision soon,"" I said with a weak smile and left.

I went to my room and closed the door. I lay on my bed, replaying the conversation with Grandpa and Grandma.

I never thought I'd get married so soon, let alone just for the sake of the company. But deep down, I knew this company held my mother's memories, her hard work, and her dream of making Amario Enterprises one of the leading companies in the world.

I always thought that when I married, it would be for love, not a business arrangement.

I never had time to date in high school; I was always busy with studies and a part-time job. If any guy tried to ask me out, Chloe and Jessica made sure I never went.

I still remember the night after graduation when there was a party at our house.

FLASHBACK

I was in my room, checking my email about the applications I had submitted to various universities. I could hear the loud music coming from downstairs.

Chloe had invited everyone to the party. She even asked me to join, but I politely declined, knowing she and Jessica would likely have a plan to humiliate me again.

Suddenly, I heard a knock on my door. I closed my laptop and walked over. Opening it, I saw Justin standing there, holding two cans of beer.

""Hey, Sarah!"" he greeted me and walked into my room, sitting on my bed and looking around.

""Hey, Justin! What brings you here?"" I asked, walking towards him.

Justin was in the same grade as me and Chloe. He was one of the popular guys in high school. We weren't close friends, but we had worked on some projects and assignments together. He seemed like a genuine guy.

""Why are you sitting here alone? Why didn't you come downstairs and join us?"" he asked.

""Well, I don't like loud music, and I'm not used to these parties. Besides, I had some important work to do,"" I told him.

""Oh, that's alright. Everyone has their own tastes and choices,"" he said, offering me one of the beers he was holding. I politely declined.

""C'mon, relax a bit, Sarah. One beer won't harm you,"" he chuckled.

I hesitated but eventually accepted the beer and took a sip.

One beer won't harm me.

""So, what are your plans after high school?"" he asked, drinking his beer.

""Well, I'm planning to study architecture, but I haven't decided which university to choose.""

Before I could say more, I started feeling dizzy. I could hear Justin talking, but I couldn't understand what he was saying.

I could faintly hear Chloe and Jessica's voices inside the room. I heard them talking, but I couldn't make out the words.

Jessica's voice came closer as she whispered in my right ear.

""Let's have some fun, Sarah,"" she said, laughing wickedly.

I tried to get up, but Chloe pushed me back onto the bed. My T-shirt was yanked off aggressively, and my jeans were pulled down. I tried to shout for help, but no words came out. I could hear Chloe, Jessica, and Justin giggling.

I was lying there in just my underwear. Someone pulled me closer, and I heard Justin whisper something in my ear. All I could understand was that they were up to something terrible.

Justin gripped my waist, then started svcking on my neck.

""Please... don't,"" I begged them.

But they didn't stop. After a few minutes, I heard Jessica say it was enough; they'd gotten what they wanted.

I sighed in relief, but then I felt someone tugging at my hair. Before I could react, they started cutting it. I struggled with what little energy I had left, but a sharp kick to my ribs knocked me out.

FLASHBACK ENDS

When I regained consciousness, it was already the next day. I was still on the bed, my underwear tor-n. When I looked in the mirror, I saw bruises around my ribs and belly. My hair was nearly all gone—I was almost bald.

Jessica, Justin, and Chloe had made a video of me and Justin in bed. In the video, only my face was visible, while only Justin's back was shown.

They shared the video on every social media platform, and the whole school assumed I had shot it and shared it to gain popularity.

I even told Dad, but he blamed me for not being careful. Later, he chose to believe others, thinking I had purposely shared the video.

A tear slipped down my cheek, but I quickly wiped it away. Because of that night, I couldn't trust any guy. Although I managed to overcome this fear when I moved to Boston, becoming more comfortable around new people, I still struggled.

I even went on a few dates, but things never progressed. I was still uncomfortable with intimacy and trusting anyone.

Thinking about the marriage proposal, I realized I still didn't know who I was supposed to marry. All I knew from Grandpa was that he was the young CEO of a rapidly growing construction company.

I spent the whole night tossing and turning in bed, thinking about the marriage and the company merger.

By 4 a.m., after a night of deep contemplation, I was finally ready with my decision.

Chapter 6

Sarah P.O.V

It was nearly 11 in the morning, and I was ready with my decision. I went downstairs and knocked on Grandpa's door; he opened it.

I walked into the room and saw Grandma sitting on the couch, reading a magazine. I sat next to her while Grandpa sat across from us. I cleared my throat before speaking.

""Grandpa, Grandma, I've made my decision. I want to save my mother's company; I don't want to lose Amario Enterprises. I'm ready for the marriage,"" I told them.

As soon as I finished speaking, I saw both my grandparents beaming with happiness. Grandma immediately hugged me tightly.

""Oh Sarah, I knew you would make the right decision. I'm sure this marriage and merger will bring much happiness to your life,"" Grandpa said while kissing my forehead.

""I'm sure you'll fulfil the responsibilities of both a wife and the new CEO of Amario Enterprises,"" Grandma said, clasping her hands together.

Both Grandma and Grandpa started discussing the merger and wedding. It had been ages since I'd seen them this happy. When Mom was alive, we always spent our vacations with Grandpa and Grandma.

We used to have so much fun then; Mom and Grandma would bake cakes and muffins together, while Dad and Grandpa taught me horseback riding and swimming.

Those were some of my happiest memories with my family.

Thinking of my father made me realize it had been five years since I'd seen him.

During those years, he never contacted me, and I didn't make any effort either. Before moving back here, I hoped he might visit, but it's been nearly a month since I returned, and he hasn't shown up.",1,1752403893.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1. I've seen brands like Nuova Simonelli, Rocket Espresso, La Marzocco (a lot of these), Sanremo, Faema, Schaerer and so on. So I can't help but wonder, are there ""specialties"" that some brand may focus on? Or would I expect kind of similar features across brands with the same price range?

2. For grinders, it has been stressed that single-dose are nicer to prevent beans going stale from air contact, but on a commercial scale, it might not be feasible. For grinders with hoppers filled to meet the day's needs, would there be a big loss or difference in taste of the beans from sitting inside the hopper for hours?

I've had an amazing latte in China from a chain coffee store (uses fully automatic Schaerer) and just like anyone else, I'm trying to check if it's feasible start-up cost-wise to open a shop where I live (the Philippines), thus the machine questions. I want to understand the possible shortcomings of a $10,000 espresso machine compared to a $20,000 one, and the differences across brands, while simultaneously experimenting with my own home setup.",0,1752403687.0,espresso,0,0.5,False

5 Tips to Train Yourself to Think Positively
Improve your mindset and your health with simple shifts to your thinking and actions.
Winston Churchill said that “a pessimist sees the difficulty in every opportunity; an optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty.” Having a positive attitude can help you make the best of difficult situations. A positive mindset may help you find solutions to problems, or it may help you realize that what first seemed like a problem really isn’t a big deal after all.

""""
And negative thoughts don’t just affect your mood … they also affect your health. Researchers found that people who had a positive outlook were one-third less likely to have a heart attack or other heart issue within five to 25 years than those with a more negative outlook—even if they had a family history of heart disease.1

Luckily, positive thinking is a skill that anyone can learn. Here are five tips to train yourself to think positively.

How to Think Positively: Best Practices for Mind and Body
Notice and reframe negative thoughts. At first, you may not even be aware of your negative thoughts. Spend a day paying attention to your self-talk. You may be surprised by how many of your thoughts are pessimistic.

First, don’t criticize yourself for having these thoughts! Just notice your next negative thought and say to yourself, “Cancel that!” to stop the pattern. Next, reframe the negative thought by turning it around and finding something positive. For instance, instead of being irritated by traffic, spend a moment appreciating your car or the extra time to listen to music or a podcast. Rather than thinking, “I’m terrible at cooking” when a meal doesn’t turn out well, think, “Every day, I get better at cooking.”

Practice gratitude. Take time to acknowledge the good things in your life. Doing so will put you in a more positive frame of mind. A regular practice of saying or writing down three things you’re grateful for each day will help train you to look for things that make you happy. The more specific you can be, the better! Perhaps today you’ll feel grateful for your favorite sweater, your comfortable bed, and your beloved pet. Maybe tomorrow you’ll feel grateful for an inspirational teacher, the friend who’s always there for you, and the delicious dinner you cooked (because every day you get better at cooking!).
Be kind to yourself. Make a quick list of five things you enjoy doing. You might be surprised to realize that you don’t often do the things you enjoy! Keep that list handy and do something that makes you happy as often as you can, whether it’s taking a walk before work, enjoying a bubble bath, or reading a book. The better you feel, the more positive thoughts you’ll notice yourself having.
Do something good for others. It feels even better to do something nice for others than for yourself! Buy a coffee for the person in line behind you at the café, send someone a silly card, or simply text a friend and tell them how much they mean to you. By making someone else feel good, you’ll put positivity into the world and also feel good about yourself.
Laugh! It’s easy to find negativity in this world. It’s OK to tune that out from time to time and find the fun. Spend time with a friend who makes you laugh, watch a funny TV show or movie, or enjoy your favorite comic on stage (live or in a recorded performance). Even remembering something funny that happened in the past can make you laugh today and improve your mood.
Put these tips into practice and notice how much better you feel. Once you’re thinking positively, you’ll realize you can do anything!

How to Think Positively: Science-Backed Methods 
Business consultant, Mark Guidi compiled a list of five studies2 that reinforce the benefits of positivity. 

Visualization and Happiness: A study involving 102 individuals with anxiety disorder divided them into three groups. One group visualized positive outcomes to their worries, another thought of verbal positive outcomes, and the third visualized any positive image when worrying. The groups that visualized positive images showed significant improvements in happiness and restfulness as well as a reduction in anxiety.
Happiness and Success: A comprehensive review study that included over 275,000 participants examined the relationship between happiness and success. The findings revealed that happier individuals tend to be more successful, driven by their optimism and positive mindset.
Stress and the Immune System: Dr. Suzanne Segerstrom led a study that synthesized findings from over 300 studies to investigate the impact of stress on the human body. The research found that short-term stress can enhance the immune system, while long-term stress can lead to its weakening and other health issues.
Coping Mechanisms and PTSD: The Penn Resilience Program is based on decades of research and focuses on teaching techniques to cope with stress and foster positivity. This program has been implemented among various groups, including school children, college students, and U.S. Army soldiers, to improve mental resilience and prevent conditions like post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).
Positive Thoughts and Longevity: The Nun Study analyzed autobiographies written by nuns in 1930. The study identified that those who expressed more positive emotions in their writing had longer lifespans, suggesting a link between positive thinking and longevity.
Each of these studies underscores the significant impact of positive thinking on various aspects of life, from emotional well-being to physical health and success.",1,1752403323.0,Advice,0,0.6,False

I lie upon grass that has forgotten seasons, while time slides past in invisible rivers, and I cry not for my own ruin but for the sudden triumph of the poor, as if joy itself has become unbearable. Smart ravens perch above, clever witnesses to all the hidden grief, their voices weaving riddles as I whisper that I am the worst, that I am selfish, alone, knowing nothing of why life veers off its course, nor how I became a stranger to the beating heart of things. No one sees me, unseen as frost on dark branches, as winter comes softly with rabbits tracing white secrets between trees whose leafless limbs cut into a sky of faint green and blue, and in that silent season I glimpse a house whose windows glow red with warmth, where a family wraps themselves in soft laughter and love, and I, outside, peer through the glass as if it were the border of a forgotten world. Then a girl sees me, steps from warmth into snow, her feet silvered with frost, and finds me hidden behind the dark trees, bringing cake and grape drink, and together we sit in quiet, beneath the falling snow, while smoke coils like whispered spells from the house chimney, and she kisses my trembling hand, discovering my cold skin, my few thin clothes, the blood dried upon me from wolves’ sharp teeth, and she and her family gather around me each night, telling stories of a monster no weapon can slay, tales of ancient power and kings who wed the poorest, most beautiful girls in kingdoms woven of sorrow and moonlight. For them, I killed a bear whose fur still smelled of pine and fear, and her father clasped my shoulder, called me friend, though I did not know what hidden spark they saw in me. They called me Dog, set me to watch over the oldest grandmother in a house leaning into the dark of the world’s edge, a house where the best chocolate and coffee poured like velvet into my lonely veins, until the woods called me back and I wandered beneath snow-heavy pines, finding a bag filled with toys and weapons, as if some ancient child-soldier had left his past behind, and one night a star fell close as a lover’s breath, so close that new creatures stepped from behind trees, and seas roared up to swallow paths, while alien beings descended in silence to reclaim their wounded daughter star, whose body glowed with deep wounds and whose signs spoke of betrayal among her own. I became Bigfoot then, roaring blood and thunder, slaughtering the aliens in their sleek sorrow, until I transformed into a frog and floated across the bluest sea, where my own face shivered in the depths like prophecy, and the star-girl, radiant and trembling, spoke in words that cracked the earth, saying our house would be a shell of diamond, our nest among nebulous stars adrift upon the ocean’s endless heart.

She, this girl of strange and secret light, wrote the first science-fiction book with her eyes, her gaze composed of pearls and gems red and green and blue, and gentle medieval people welcomed us with songs and wreaths, until a dragon came in scales like smoldering suns, killing all until the snow was red as a dying rose, and in the last moment, gasping blood, the girl said, “I am the dragon who loves you now,” and we wept together beside a fallen tree, her body delicate as a rose petal’s edge, her flat stomach trembling under clothes that tore as easily as a sigh, her form ghostlike upon the rose that floated on the sea. Air was her music, thunder her laughter; she played with baby goats and tiny cats white as snowdrifts, our eyes always half-closed from the softness of a world too gentle to bear, hiding shyly as spiders weaving delicate silver webs, and I played with her nose as we tumbled down snowy mountains, into new valleys blushing pink, where hundreds of tiny spiders spun glistening cities among the branches, and the girl laughed with fearless delight, a witch and a child in the same breath.

On a hilltop stood a single tree beneath which an old witch slumbered in her swamp, crocodiles resting in the pools of her dark mouth, and the girl’s spit became a stream where smurfs danced deep in hidden forests, and she drew visions directly from her shimmering imagination, fleeing a stepmother of prison-tentacles, and rejoiced when I caught her as she leapt from the cliff into my arms, her home a shipwreck by the ocean where she lived shy and afraid, the first human soul she had ever seen, until we built a treehouse and watched sunsets reflected in each other’s eyes, where she knew love but could not yet speak it, and we stared at the horizon, silent as new snow. Weak and almost unconscious, tigers with red eyes prowled near, while she touched my lips, my face, my hair, threading my fingers through her silken strands, her voice glassy and soft as ice, whispering secrets while giants watched from far peaks, and she found strange delight in the touch of hair upon skin, as we stared at her legs, her eyes darting between sky and me and sky again, meteors crossing the heavens like silver runes, rain hidden in trembling leaves that sometimes dropped cool drops onto our faces, as her shy intelligence gleamed like a hidden gem and I lay upon her, while she stared upward with tears brimming, smiling through them as we turned to watch television flickering with romantic tales, her archive of passion flicking softly in the wind which howled outside the flower-patterned curtains.

Ships sailed far off under the sign of Sagittarius, and she performed Greek myths for me, leading me into the darkest corners of the forest where the ghosts of her family lay fallen, and there she gave me a drink that swept my past into shadow, leaving only what I chose to keep, and taught me how to kiss her, guiding me with sly seductions through hidden paths winding between mossy trunks and silent pools, where we wandered endlessly into places differing only by the scent of pine or the curl of moss, laughing until our voices echoed between trees, swinging from rope branches like woodland sprites, and splashing in dark rivers, resting on cold stones while stars filled our eyes with trembling stories, and animals and ghosts alike traveled beside us, as she waved a wand and colored the night in Lovecraftian visions, while in a cabin of old timbers we investigated footsteps red with blood, yet she could hush the fear with a single breath.

I could not believe how easy life felt in that forgotten realm where she shaped wind into roads, made it snow at will, where we danced neck to neck in slow reverence upon a frozen lake beneath pink meteors falling like petals from the gods, and dinosaur birds screamed overhead, while she brandished her wand and her robe spun in circles, and we pressed forehead to forehead, murmuring questions and kindness, as sea levels rose and swords gleamed and she painted futures with jest, always herself, never pretending wisdom, only breathing pure, bewildering truth.

**This book just delivered the most BRUTAL revenge marriage and I'm already emotionally destroyed 😱💔**

**""His Baby Card in Begging Me Back""**

Y'all, I thought I was getting complicated romance but this book said ""let me traumatize you with the most savage revenge story ever"" and I am SHOOK by the cruelty!

**The premise:** Nicholas married Grace purely for revenge because her mother allegedly destroyed his father's marriage. He keeps her as his prisoner-wife, using her for his physical needs. When she gets pregnant, he wants to ""terminate it immediately"" but she flees to protect the baby. He forcibly takes the baby at 8 months, then 5 years later uses their son to manipulate her return. The TOXICITY is off the charts! 💀

**Why I'm absolutely HORRIFIED:**

* Nicholas literally saying ""Do you think you have the right to bear my child?"" - the CRUELTY
* Grace being treated like a sex slave under the guise of marriage - this is DARK
* 299 chapters with 4.6 rating of what's clearly going to be intense emotional trauma
* The doctor warning about miscarriage while Nicholas continues to force himself on her
* Her collapsing from stress and him finding the ultrasound report - the TIMING
* The synopsis revealing he TAKES THE BABY from her at 8 months - I'M NOT OKAY

**What's sending me into EMOTIONAL CHAOS:**

* Grace being kicked out by her own father and having literally no one
* ""Even if I get tired of you, you'll never leave my side"" - the possessive toxicity
* Her trying to please him with coffee hoping to discuss the baby - the desperation
* The way she's terrified of him ""to her very core"" while pregnant
* Nicholas thinking she's trying to ""use the child to gain forgiveness"" - TOXIC MASCULINITY
* The revenge being based on something her MOTHER allegedly did - punishing the wrong person

**The moral complexity is STAGGERING:**

* Revenge marriage with forced intimacy
* Pregnancy complications from abuse
* Taking a baby from its mother
* Using a child as emotional manipulation
* 5-year separation and forced reunion through blackmail

Radiant really said ""let me write the most psychologically damaging revenge story"" and I'm here for the eventual redemption arc while being VERY concerned about the trauma portrayal!

**Rating: 4/5 stars** for intense storytelling (minus one for the darkness) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Anyone else reading this? I NEED to know how Grace survives this trauma and if Nicholas ever truly redeems himself. The emotional journey is going to be BRUTAL! 😤

**Content warning:** Domestic abuse, forced pregnancy themes, and psychological manipulation

Guest leaves. Instantly writes a 1 star review. This is the review : 

“I was woken up with loud music followed by noise coming from  kitchen, which my bedroom is right next to. Pots and pans, coffee machine sounds, doors slamming. Not only this but the host decides to throw a party and invite every single person they know. Don’t recommend if you want a peaceful rest inconsiderate and rude”. 

Fair review? 😭 

Perhaps. Perhaps if it was past 11am on their check out, and this guest who has no perspective or understanding that it’s 50 minutes past their check out and had reminders last night and in the morning, despite this they remained in your house, woke up super late and decided to complain about YOU in your home when this was meant to be the last guest for the year since we are no longer going Airbnb for a while 😭 


Airbnb ofcouse backs up the guest as this is their experience. This is all a joke 😭 on top of all this, the guest wakes up at 11:45 and decides to slowly get ready to check out and leaves around 1pm.

1lypjgi,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lypjgi/no_one_is_here_with_me/,no one is here with me,"it had been nearly six hours since i started writing code when i first noticed it. before i get into what happened, you should know: i am a cs major. i fit the stereotype: high-powered specs, mostly unshaven face, occasional gym visits at odd hours, and always a diet coke or coffee in hand. none of that really matters except that i had been working on a paper and showed up at my desk at 9 am, as usual. the usual morning rush was there: undergrads running to class, professors heading to lectures, and some sleep-deprived seniors scrambling to meet deadlines. as i said, everything was: just usual. another morning in an engineering building.

i took the elevator to my floor, sat down with my coffee, wired in my headphones, and got to work. by 1 pm, hunger kicked in. josh, my lab mate, who sat opposite to me, hadn’t shown up. maybe he was working from home, i really didn't care. i brushed it off and kept going. at 3 pm, i couldn’t ignore my hunger anymore. i unplugged my headphones from my laptop and connected them to my phone. i don’t like walking without music. it leaves me alone with my thoughts and my thoughts aren’t exactly the most encouraging ones out there. sometimes, it fuels random grand scenarios in my head where i do stuff i possibly can't do in real life. if research doesn’t work out, maybe i should consider film-making. but hey that is not what i am here for. i am here because i am stuck. let me walk you through what exactly has happened to me.

i got up from my desk, and the hall seemed empty, i figured people had either gone out for classes, or perhaps they were just out for their lab meetings or whatever. took the elevator to the 10th floor for the cafeteria. oddly, it went down first, then straight up. no one boarded at the ground floor. i got off the elevator, and walked into the cafeteria. here is when i started noticing it.

the cafeteria was completely empty. I scurried across to the study hall on the other end of the 10th floor. empty. every corner of the 10th floor was dead silent. an eerie feeling started to creep in. i was no longer wearing my headphones, i had removed them and put them on my head to return to reality. i hurried back down. my workspace was deserted, but had it always been? the emptiness felt too complete, like it had been this way for hours. where the hell did everyone go? i rushed to the ground floor. nothing. no security, no students. i stepped outside. the sky was…wrong. a deep red-orange hue, unnatural for 3:15 pm. the street which is usually packed with students and outsiders alike, was abandoned.

panic set in. i called josh. no service. the wifi still showed as connected, but nothing loaded. messages didn’t get sent. phone calls failed. it was as if the world had shut me out. i turned back to the building. the other elevator was still running, moving between floors, stopping randomly. but no matter how many times i pressed the button, it never came for me.

maybe this was a dream. maybe if i go back and try to sleep, i can just wake up to normalcy. i returned to my desk. leaving the building felt worse. if this was something out of *coherence*, then waiting it out seemed like my best option. my head ached. i tried to sleep.

when i woke up, my phone read 15:29. weird. i was sure I had slept longer. my analog watch, however, showed 7:27. am? pm? if it was pm, why was it still bright outside? i turned back to my screen, mind racing. then, something small caught my eye. i got distracted for just a second. that’s when i saw that stupid github copilot was still working and suggesting an auto-completion for a line in my code. i figured that it might be my only connection to something beyond this void. i started typing, trying to trick it into giving me a way out. i asked for steps to access an external site. instead of real steps, it generated a bizarre, randomized link.

i hesitated. then clicked. and it led me here. so here i am. confused as hell. starving. scared but somehow keeping it together. someone here must have seen something like this before.

i low-key wish i had not seen what i saw right outside my window. but it was only after i finished completing a draft of this post when i noticed it: a cross taped to the window, from the outside. and then i suddenly remembered. the elevator game. well. i guess i am gone for good.",6,1752402376.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

Hey Leute,  
vor einem Monat habe ich euch meinen Traum vorgestellt: TropiCoffee, fruchtige Kaffeebohnen ohne Sirup, ohne Zucker, aber mit vollem Aroma.  
Jetzt, 1 Monat später, ein kleines Update & ein paar Fragen an euch!

**Was bisher geschah**:

* Die Website wurde stark überarbeitet
* Erste Bestellungen sind reingekommen
* Das Feedback ist überwältigend! Ich habe schon viele Bewertungen erhalten (von „endlich mal was Neues“ bis „überraschend lecker“).
* Einige trinken es kalt wie Eistee, andere heiß wie Cappuccino – genau wie geplant

**Was jetzt ansteht**  
Ich will noch gezielter werden.

**Welche Zielgruppe passt am besten zu TropiCoffee?**

* Menschen, die keinen klassischen Kaffee mögen?
* Kreative? Junge Leute? Fitness-Community?
* Wer liebt fruchtige, verspielte Sorten im Alltag?

**Neue Produktidee – was denkt ihr?**  
Ich überlege, **nachhaltige Kapseln + passendes Pulver** anzubieten.  
Die Idee: Kapseln sind wiederverwendbar, Kunden füllen sie selbst mit unserem fruchtigen TropiCoffee-Pulver.  
Klingt das spannend? Oder zu kompliziert?

Ich bin super dankbar für jede ehrliche Meinung – ihr habt mir schon beim Start so geholfen. 🙏

1lypiit,https://www.reddit.com/r/HousingUK/comments/1lypiit/rightmove_review/,Rightmove Review,"Morning all, would really appreciate some feedback on our Right Move listing if anyone has the chance today please: https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/162320594#/?channel=RES_BUY (Location: Colchester, Essex, England).

We have had quite a few viewings since launching in May but no offers have materialised as yet.

It's a basic new build house, and our first home together, but we have taken pride in keeping it in good condition since we owned it and are now just on the next chapter of our lives and need to step up size wise.

We've also done some minor improvements such as boarding out the loft with drop-down ladder for extra easy storage and extending the outside patio area over an access drain, which makes it look so much nicer.

I know the feelings of new builds, but we felt this plot ticked a few boxes that others on the development didn't (not overlooked, quiet no through road, private driveway for 2-3 cars to name a few). This particular development is also the highest rated/reviewed in Colchester, with the area having a great reputation and it's own private amenities worked in (GP, Co-op, Coffee Shop, Gym, Nursery (and more, see: ""Chesterwell Plaza""), plus plenty of green space, woods, parks and a rec for local walks accessible right from the doorstep), so you're not just living in a sea of houses. Construction has also finished this end, so you're not ""living on a building site"". 

The feedback from our viewings has predominantly been an aversion to an open plan living space and the size of the rooms being on the smaller side, which we can't do much about!

So the next thought we had was price (it's always price!), the listing value was governed by four separate agent valuations we undertook with the average value coming out at 356k. 

Our house style is also available from new still, at a price of 380-385k. Someone else also has theirs listed at the top of our road for 375k, albeit detached, but we understand they purchased theirs in the height of the COVID bubble around the 390-400k mark and are trying to mitigate their losses.

So with all that in mind, the price didn't seem too bad on first glance, but welcome any comments on this as this will be our first time selling and have been lead totally by the Agents in this regard... Are we just being impatient, is this a quieter time of the year, too much local competition perhaps?

Hopefully that covers everything off, really appreciate any insight this great community can share - Many thanks in advance.",1,1752402276.0,HousingUK,10,1.0,False

1lyphw7,https://i.redd.it/nixwtixebmcf1.jpeg,I made a form-fillable spell/feat/condition cards for PF2e + SF2e,"Hey folks,

I’ve been running Pathfinder 2e and now testing Starfinder 2e a ton lately, and I kept wishing I had a tidy way to track home brew spells, weird edge-case conditions, or custom feats.

So I made this: a printable, form-fillable card template you can use for **spells, feats, actions, features, or conditions**. It's got built-in cut guides (outside the safe zone so they don’t show), and it’s optimised for printing and card sleeves.

You can grab it here:  
👉 [**Download here**](https://gum.co/u/y3yq4f9n)

It’s pay-what-you-want, so grab it for free or toss me a coffee if you dig it.

Hope it helps your table run smoother!

Cheers,
