Time, an arrow of sequential events moving from the past to the future, is so intuitive that we often conclude that it is a fundamental property of the physical universe. Being instinctively wired to remember past events and to be able to predict the possible outcomes in the future is a biological advantage. Mathematically however, time is simply a higher order quantification of movement (distance and velocity) and it is usually used to describe relative movements. For example, it is more efficient to relate your movements by saying “Let’s meet at the coffee shop at 9 am on Saturday” than “Let’s meet over there in three and a half earth rotations”. Time is an extraordinarily useful conceptual framework and we are biologically hardwired to “see” it; but, time is not inherently required in the physical universe. 

There is a temporal dimension of spacetime which is a required part of our physical universe. Confusingly, this temporal dimension is also referred to as “time” but it is distinctly different. It is not man-made and it exists as an inherent property of the physical world. By uncoupling (and clearly defining) these two different definitions of “time,” we can separate the man-made, sequential, arrow of time from the temporal dimension of spacetime. 

We will define “time” as the man-made invention of a line of sequential events. The term “temporal dimension (or component or coordinate) of spacetime” will be used to describe the physical component of spacetime. 

Mathematic Definition of Time

Time (t), the man-made tool to quantify motion, can be understood by the equation: 

t=d/v

This helps remind us that time is a higher order function of distance. Distances can be tricky to measure especially if the observer is undergoing relative motion. Length contraction (or expansion) occurs in systems with relative motion due to the theory of relativity. These changes of measured length redemonstrate themselves mathematically in time calculations too, and we can reclassify the relative length changes as “time dilation.” Indeed, time dilation is the same relativity phenomenon as length contraction just by a different name. 


The Quality of the Temporal Dimension of Spacetime

The Pauli exclusion principle requires a temporal component to exist so that two objects do not occupy the same location in spacetime. The temporal component of spacetime is zero dimensional and is not a line like time is constructed to be. Understanding a zero-dimensional temporal dimension can initially be unsettling, especially with a biological instinct to create linear time and a lifetime of using it as a tool. Living in a zero-dimensional temporal dimension simply means that while you are always free to review (i.e. observe) records from the past, you will be continuously pinned to the present. So for any two objects in four dimensional spacetime their coordinates (T,x,y,z) will always be (T,x1,y1,z1)  and (T,x2,y2,z2). Where T=T, and x1, y1,z1≠x2, y2,z2. This satisfies the Pauli exclusion principle. Notice there is no subscript for the temporal component because it never changes and is a universal point in spacetime. It must be noted that just because two things happened at the same temporal point does not mean you will observe their coincidence due to the length contraction of relativity and the finite speed of light but other processes like quantum entanglement may become easier to understand. 

We should not make spacetime holier than it is. Just because you don’t exist in spacetime (i.e. something cannot be described by a spacetime coordinate of (T,x,y,z) doesn’t mean that it didn’t exist or won’t exist in spacetime. Spacetime is not all powerful and does not contain all reality that has ever occurred. We can use a portion of spacetime to help illustrate this point. You may have been to Paris. If so, you have records of it. Souvenirs, pictures, and memories (biological records) but you do not currently exist in Paris (with the exception of my Parisian readers.) The same is true with the entirety of spacetime. You have not always existed in spacetime. You won’t always exist in spacetime. But, you do currently exist in spacetime at the coordinates (T,x,y,z). If you want to create a synthetic block universe that holds all events and objects that have ever existed or will ever exist you can construct one but you will need to construct a line of time to do it. 

How to Construct a Timeline

You are free to construct a timeline of any time and for any reason. In fact, you are biologically hardwired to do it. If you want to do it more formally you can.

You’ll need to start with records. These can be spacetime coordinates, cones of light, memories, music notes, photographs or any observed series of events that occur in spacetime. All of these individual records occurred at the spacetime coordinates (T,x,y,z) where the spacial coordinates of x,y,z makeup dimensional space and allow for motion. To create a timeline we will need to string together these infinitely small temporal spacetime points (via the mathematical tool of integration) to give a line. This line of time may be straight or curved depending on whether the observer of the events in your timeline is undergoing relative motion to the event being observed.  The function f(T) works for either scenario of straight or non-straight lines of time; however, if the observer of the timeline has no relative motion then the line of time becomes straight (or linear) and f(T) becomes a constant. The equations for your constructed timeline equates time (t) to the integration of temporal spacetime points (T) for a given reference from from a to b where a <= b <= T:

t=integral from a to b of f(T)dT

For systems without relative motion your timeline simplifies to:

t=integral from a to b (1/a)dT

These equation allow you to construct a timeline and in this way, you give time a dimension and a direction. A line and an arrow. You constructed it by stringing together zero dimensional temporal components and you can use it as you see fit. You built it out of the temporal components of spacetime but it is a tool, and like a hammer it is real, but it is not an inherent physical component of the universe. 


On Clocks and Time Machines

Einstein said “Time is what clocks measure.” It’s funny but also literal. Clocks allow us to measure “time” not by measuring the temporal dimension of spacetime but by counting the number of occurrences something like a pendulum or quartz crystal travels a regular distance. Traditional clocks are built to count surrogate distances that equate to the relative distance the earth has rotated given its rotational velocity since the last time the clock was calibrated. (Don’t forget the velocity of the rotation of the earth isn’t consistent, it’s slowing albeit incredibly slowly compared to what we usually measure.) If there is no relative motion in a system, then that distance stays fixed. Records based on these regular rhythms will coincide. However, as Einstein points out, when you introduce relative motions then distance experiences length contraction (or expansion) and it is no longer regular. Relative distances (and the corresponding times calculated from those distances) will start to show discrepancies. 

Time travel with a time machine through the temporal component of spacetime would have to be plausible if the temporal component of spacetime was inherently linear but because the temporal component of spacetime is a zero dimensional point, travel anywhere is prohibited and time travel in any direction is fundamentally impossible. The concept of a “time machine” then, being contraptions that we build to help us navigate our constructed linear time already exist and they are ubiquitous in our world. They just go by their more common name: clocks. They help us navigate our constructed timelines. 

Entropy

Neither the definition of time as a higher order mathematical function of motion nor the zero dimensional nature of the temporal component of spacetime negates the second law of thermodynamics. 

The law states that “entropy of an isolated system either remains constant or increases with time.” We have two options here. We can leave the law exactly as stated and just remind ourselves that entropy doesn’t inherently create a linear temporal component of spacetime, rather it’s the integration of zero dimensional temporal points of recorded entropy into a timeline that allows us to manufacture an arrow of time. In this way we can use entropy as a clock to measure time just as we can use gravity’s effect on a pendulum (which actually makes for a more reliable clock.) 

This brings us to an interesting fact about time. Being defined by relative motions, it cannot exist in a system without movement; so in a theoretical world where absolutely no motion occurs you remain at the coordinates of (T,x1,y1,z1). You would exist in an eternity of the present. Thankfully something in the universe is always in motion and you can create a timeline when and where you see fit. 


What does this mean about events of the future?

Three things are true with a zero-dimensional temporal component of spacetime: you are free to observe the past, you are pinned to the present, events of the future exist as probabilities. 

The probabilities of a given outcome in the future exists as a wavefunction. Probabilities of future outcomes can be increased or decreased based on manipulating factors in the present. The wave functions collapses (or branch) into existence when observed at the temporal spacetime point of  T because all observations must occur at the present temporal coordinate of spacetime (T). 

Conclusion

Time and the temporal component of spacetime are different things. Time is an arrow created from the integration of temporal time points that function as a higher order mathematical description of motion. This motion, and consequently the calculated value of time can be affected by relativity if there is relative motion in the system. The temporal component of spacetime is a zero-dimensional facet of four-dimensional spacetime where you are free to observe records of the past, you are pinned to the present and future outcomes are based on probabilities.

If you are working in a specific area of physics, especially if you are wrestling with a particular paradox or problem, I encourage you to try approaching it from a zero dimensional perspective of spacetime and see what possibilities present themselves to you.

1ikej6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/Chennai/comments/1ikej6z/miot_is_such_an_ass_when_it_comes_to_service/,MIOT is such an ass when it comes to service,"I recently admitted my dad to a hospital in Pondicherry since he met with an accident and broke some of his shoulder bones. Doctors over there told him that his condition won't improve much even if he goes for surgery, and they didn't recommend it, citing his age. Somehow he managed to get past two weeks of unbearable pain since his shoulder was basically hanging without much support inside. Unable to watch him suffer, we decided to visit MIOT for a second opinion. Right from the consultation to the post-surgery care, doctors did their job so well that we can't find anything to complain about them. After 2 weeks of nightmares, we are more than just happy to see my dad able to move his hand without much pain, and his shoulder looks firm, unlike the dropped appearance it had before.

However, the management here has some practices I haven't seen much before. Before coming here, we've been told how MIOT restricts visitors and outside food, but we didn't realise the extent to which they implement it until we came here. After a whole day of running all over the hospital for consultation and admission, my dad was denied even fruits and coffee once he got admitted. They told us we would get milk together with dinner if we ordered, and yet they couldn't deliver it despite us ordering it multiple times. When a hospital strictly follows such a rule, one would expect the hospital food to taste at least decent to justify what they are doing, which certainly isn't the case. Half of the time it tastes like crap, and you'll have no reason to stand it unless you have sugar or BP. You are further doomed if you are used to having heavy meals, since the quantity they serve isn't enough for my dad, who is a light eater these days. Do they expect the patient to starve for nothing? When a couple of visitors tried to bring some fruits for him, they made a big deal out of it and stopped them outside the bay. They follow this irrespective of the patient's health condition.

I couldn't find a single goddamn water dispenser anywhere inside the hospital, not even in their main canteen. When I went looking for some hot water to drink, I was given a packaged water bottle by the nurse and a kettle to heat it up. All this for a hospital with a room rent of 2.8k per day. On the day of discharge, I asked them for 3 more water bottles as the discharge would take up to 10 hours. They replied that they've closed the bill, which meant they can't give away anything further. But one of them was kind enough to give us a couple of it.

And then they did something that turned my perception of insurance upside down. On the day of admission, they raised an estimate of around 2.5L with our insurer, and they asked us to pay an initial amount of 30k before admission, which seemed fine. Though the estimate was authorised by my insurer within the next few hours, they asked me to pay the rest of the amount after they took my dad for the surgery. I paid it without much question, as I've got my father ready to get a blade under his skin somewhere. Though they told me that they'll refund all these once the insurance is claimed, it raised a lot of questions. What is the point of cashless claims if I have to pay in lakhs at the time of treatment and wait till I get it refunded? I've been thinking of getting health insurance with coverage big enough to handle even the most serious of illnesses for my family. But insurance like that wouldn't be of much use if I'm going to lose my peace of mind gathering lakhs at the last moment despite paying a hefty, inflation+age adjusted premium year after year.

I've gone through a similar phase in Alwarpet Kavery for my mom. But the management over there made no such fuss about any of the points I complained about. If it wasn't for the doctors here, my dad would have split this place into halves for the way they treat their patients and attendants.

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

It may have been aided by a mini cola I had that morning, but I doubt it because of timing, body feelings, and the amount of caffeine. I'm going to try and finally get a formal diagnosis for ADHD through my schools mental health department. 

I started a new school a week ago. Dorms, uniforms, lots of rules. Surprisingly, I adjusted pretty well. My first full day in class went pretty well, I was just really sleepy. I was more awake the second day but that's when I noticed the sound that the lights make. It's like a quiet beep. Just a consistent beep that I can't stop noticing. The only time I don't hear it is when the heating system turns on. That's pretty much the only time I don't hear it. And not just the sound, but the lights themselves. It's like a subtle pressure on my eyes. Now, class lasts a long time. It starts at 7:45, and our lunch break is 12. We get mini-breaks that don't last long, but we're still in the classroom. I have to sit with the beep and the light for 5 fucking hours straight, with an hours break, and then I have to sit in there for another 3 hours. By 10am I start to feel myself becoming overwhelmed for it. I have to cover my ears or my eyes to give myself some sense of relief, and it's never really enough. 

Note: because of my anxiety, I have an accomodation to wear headphones. But they're only allowed when the teacher or another speaker isn't talking. This week has been pretty much all talking, especially today, so I wasn't really able to wear them. 

Today, I tried something different. I didn't want to feel tired during class so I drank a small coke. That's about 21 mg of caffeine. On average, coffee has 95mg. Admittedly, too much caffeine makes me anxious. It makes me jittery and feel like my skin is crawling away from me. I become hyperactive and can't think straight. On a normal cup, I'm alright. No anxiety, but I do become a bit more aware. As coffee does. However, this can didn't do any of that. It felt like I never even drank it. I was still tired, my mind wasn't racing, I wasn't jittery. I was okay. None of my usual ""too much coffee"" feelings came. Additionally, it happened near the same time as the previous days. 3 hours after I drank it, and definitely after the peak which is usually when caffeine makes me anxious. 

Unlike the other days, I actually went past my limit with the lights. I stepped out of class for maybe 5 minutes and came back, but as soon as I came back I started to get worse. So I left again for the majority of the speakers presentation. This time I felt like I shutdown, but that was better than an anxiety attack so I went back to class. I was okay for a bit but eventually I got worse again and started to hyperventilate. I put my head on the table and tried to calm it, but I just had to ride it out. Part of me wonders if I was faking because at some point I just thought ""I can just stop"" and I stopped??? Idk what that was about. It felt real. Fortunately, lunch started right after. So I got an hour to recover and I was okay by the time we got back to class. It was like nothing happened.  I went about my day just fine. 

In the moment, I seriously started to doubt myself. I still do but way less now. I also found out that my schools mental health department can give ADHD diagnosis, so I made an appointment in wellness. I don't know what to do though. I can't wear my headphones, I can't just not go to class, and I want to be a good student. I want to pay attention and learn and do my best. But that can't happen if something as simple as the damn lights are causing anxiety attacks. ",1,1738986950.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

I know my life is better without her. I know we could never have spent our lives together. Deep down, I realize she is a selfish person who doesn’t deserve me or my love.

Overall, I’m at the best point in my life. I feel motivated, disciplined, in shape, confident, and genuinely enjoying life.

UA at 6.7. Prescribed 100 mg allopurinol and some prednisone.  

Doctors notes just say to avoid purine high food, and that I have gout and that I'll need retesting. 

I've got some very janky joints and have my whole life, my mom's convinced I'm hypermobile because I deal with so much hyperextension and stiffness but now I'm not sure if  I'm just bendy and have been agitating   crystals building up rather then how my mothers convinced I have HeDS, I've been having undiagnosed joint flare ups all over my body for most of my life. 

I already have celiac and so I'm very used to a restricted diet, and my boyfriend has alpha gal so I already don't eat red meat really at all, Ive had maybe 3 alcoholic drinks in the past year, I barely touch dairy and the only thing diet wise that I really feel like predisposed me is the gluten free ' convenience food' ( lots of very processed cauliflower, oat and soy, ect ), a proclivity for sweet sweet fruit juices and am definitely overweight. 

Bare in mind celiac is almost like having a medically required ED because I have to have 100% confidence my food is safe or I'll be sick for weeks, (if I accidentally have gluten in any of its 100s of forms) so I'm a little predisposed to be way too paranoid about having more restrictions.

Im all for a kick in the butt to eat and do better for my body, I absolutely need it. But, I'm a little perturbed after trying to research what I should and shouldn't eat,  how some sources state it like law and how some sources say only to eat the diet during a flare, ect.  Some things say broccoli and cauliflower are fine and some things say they're the devil, I feel like there's allot of ambiguity here. It's sorta hard to parse out who's right and who's outdated. 

Im assuming the cause of this is not the diet so much as other factors cumulatively creating the conditions, more like an autoimmune response that diet just has some effective influence on? 
 Either way I plan on making some severe cuts to my diet, cutting all soy and oats, swapping for low fat versions and generally eating more whole foods and cutting out added sugar, ect.

Im also assuming that the diet isn't needing to be as strict as I'm used to keeping my gluten free diet, but that it's more of a balancing act? 
Like, If you aren't in an active flair, do you cautiously eat what you please and then drink cherry and coffee like you're repenting?
Or do you stay pretty strict? 

From what I can understand Allo just gives you a chance to break down the crystals while you do the work of managing your UA levels, but Im honestly so hazy on this because some people seem to say it's lifelong (which I'd accept, just get me outta pain lol) and some people saying that allo is temporary and that gout is tentatively temporary, but like, wouldn't you always be predisposed to it of you can have it once?  How is that temporary?  I'm not sure if I'm just stuck viewing it under the lense of Autoimmune issues,  but it doesn't make sense for it to not be a life long thing my head. 

The internet is great and all but it's made trying to understand this mess a bit confusing. Also I want to stab google AI overview to its demise. Im just here to yell into the void I think at this point.

I wasn't sure if I should write here but maybe someone has some advice about this situation.

A few years ago I saw her for the first time (M). It was her birthday (M) at a nearby cafe that I liked to go to after school. I remember it like it was yesterday, blonde hair, long dress and unforgettable beauty. I didn't know who she was at the time or how old she was or what she was like and so on but I told myself I had to meet her. I saw that there was a girl (A) there who I can't say is my friend but rather an acquaintance. I went to her profile and saw a picture of the two of them, I immediately sent her a request (M) and didn't hesitate. She accepted and that was it. About a year passed after that where I didn't write anything to her, I even forgot about her to some extent but every time I saw her at the end, it was like my heart skipped a beat. I looked for a way to talk to her but after a while I gave up on that idea and moved on with my life. I met a nice girl (E) not long after that and we corresponded for a long time. I saw that she was friends with (M) and that's how I started a conversation. I joined her chat and we started to correspond intensively. After a while I asked her if she knew this girl (E) and if she could help me with her, to which she said she did and from the way she wrote I could tell that she seemed a little disappointed. I didn't know why but I just shrugged it off. She tried to help me by telling her friend (E) that she and I were friends and that I was a really good guy, nice and so on. We continued to correspond (me and E) and not long after that we saw each other.
It went okay, but I felt that there wasn't any excessive connection. After the date she told me I was great but that she didn't think we should have anything more than that because she didn't see me that way. I was a little tired after that, but she wasn't that important to me so I easily got over it. After about a month, she texted me (M) and asked how it went, to which I told her everything that had happened. She told me she was sorry she hadn't helped more, to which I said it didn't matter because I certainly couldn't make her like me. We continued to text (M and I) and got to know each other more and more. We had a lot in common, in fact it was like I was talking to someone I'd known my whole life. After a few days we agreed to go out into the city, have a meal and have coffee. Although I didn't think it was a date, it felt like one and I prepared myself well. As I walked to the place where we were supposed to meet, for the first time I had a strange feeling in my stomach, I can't say it was pleasant, it was a little nauseating, but somehow I was glad it was there. We met and went to the place where we were supposed to eat. The whole time we were sitting, talking, and laughing, I still had that feeling in my stomach and it was like I was falling in love with this girl in some way. From her behavior and appearance, I noticed that this date meant more to her than, for example, a classic date, so it clicked a little bit for me why she was disappointed when I asked her about her friend (E). Maybe she likes me? I thought about it while I was talking to her and these thoughts flooded my head. We started walking in the park after eating. She was beautiful. Her aura seemed different from everyone else's. We walked a bit and after a while we sat down at a monument. Although there was plenty of space, we sat next to each other, squeezed together as if there was no more room to sit. I would have felt uncomfortable and uneasy in that situation, but not with her. We talked until at one point she leaned her head on me. I was speechless and my heart started beating really fast. She asked me if I minded what she did, to which I just said no, I don’t mind. We sat like that in silence for 15-20 minutes and looked at the sky. I put one arm around her waist. I was scared of what her reaction would be, but she just grabbed my hand (hand) and held it. That evening we kissed. I usually avoid doing that, especially with people I’ve just met, but I trusted her. Something set her apart from the others.
We started dating, a little quickly but it was okay. We got to know each other and figured things out. The more time I spent with her, the more convinced I was that she was the one. We were together for a little over a year. It was wonderful, although we often argued. It would usually start with me joking with her, and she would get angry and it would turn into a small fight. I really loved her more than anything, but something was against it. Summer came. We argued more than ever about stupid things. I couldn't take it anymore and I told her I needed a little break. Even though I didn't want to do it, I had to. We had been out of touch for over a month. I still saw her but we didn't talk. Finally, I thought about it and asked her to talk. We sat down near the football stadium, and we started talking. I said what I felt and what my problem was, and so did she. We agreed to try again but that we had to fix it. And here we were, together again.The first month was nice, really nice and I felt happier than ever. However, we started further education where I met new people and different people and I paid less and less attention to her, and after a while we broke up. My immaturity led to me talking all sorts of things about her and in doing so I hurt her a lot. I made her life miserable, which at that moment I didn't think would happen. After a short time, I got into a relationship with a friend from school and we were only together for two months. I didn't need that relationship at all because the girl was really bad. She did all sorts of things and was really toxic. When I broke up with her, and after a while I realized that (M) is all I need in life to be happy. I wanted to get in touch with her again to fix everything. To go back to the old days and continue what we started.
Then I saw her. I was walking home alone. I saw her with another guy. She seemed happy, but it was like she wasn’t completely happy with him. Her boyfriend and I know each other, from different circles. He’s an okay guy. A little annoying, but he’s okay. My heart broke when I saw them. I told myself I wasn’t going to ruin anything she had with him, and that’s how it was for the next year and a half. Not a day went by that I didn’t think about her.
And so the new summer came. I talked to a friend about it because I needed to tell someone, to have someone listen to me, and she told me I should forget about it. To let her go and be happy. That’s what I did. On vacation, I visited a sacred place where I lit a candle for her and prayed that she would be happy and have everything she needed in life. It helped. I stopped thinking about her and after four months I met a beautiful girl (A) with whom I have been together for 6 months. I feel good with her and I tried to be as nice as possible to her. We never argued in all the time we were together and I always did everything I could to make her feel better.
Everything was great, until I heard from my sister that they had broken up (M and her new boyfriend). As if through a flashback, everything came back to me in a second. I hadn't forgotten anything about her, but it was as if I was just covering it up and trying to forget.
I tried to convince myself that I had a beautiful girl by my side (A) and that I shouldn't think about (M) anymore and that it was in the past. But with little success. I loved her too much to forget about her. I got in touch with (M). I asked her how she was and what she was doing. She seemed colder than ever. I could understand why that was. I wasn't the best person to her after we broke up. We talked, or I talked, and she would respond briefly. I asked her if we could talk if it wasn't a problem, to which she said we could over the phone if I wanted because she didn't want to see me while I had a girlfriend. I told her everything that was on my mind. We talked for 2 days straight. We covered a lot of topics because we hadn't talked in a long time. She said she still had feelings for me but that she still hated me for everything I did. After all that, I never got that feeling in my stomach with anyone else but her. Even now that we've been texting, it's the same feeling in my stomach as the first time. She must be special, right?
We're still in touch even though I'm in a ""happy"" relationship. I want to break up with (A) but I think it would be the wrong decision because she's a really good girl and I don't have the heart to do that to her, but this way I'm only making the situation worse because I'm talking to my ex (M) behind her back. I'm getting more and more inclined to tell her everything, and just when I'm ready, I see her and everything falls apart. She's too good a person to do something like that to her. That thought has crossed my mind 1000 times. I don't know what to do, so if you have any advice, feel free to write.
And yes, I know, we men are trash.

I got lots of good advice, but against what multiple people were saying, I decided to speak with Ali. We've been friends for so long, and frankly, this is real life. I'm not gonna cut her off without even speaking to her first, like a lot of you were saying. Also, shoutout to the person who said crying after sex was a sapphic rite of passion, my girlfriend thinks you're hilarious!! 

Anyways, with that being said, before I messaged Ali back, Freddie helped me write out roughly what I wanted to say so I could just get my thoughts out on paper before we talked. Once I felt comfortable with what we came up with, I messaged Ali and told her to meet me at the late night coffee shop we frequent, and she answered super fast. I asked Freddie if she could wait outside in the car for me in case things go south, which her being so awesome said of course. 

I was so nervous, and Ali was already there by the time we pulled up. She looked kind of nervous too, but also somehow pissed off?? I sat down and she immediately asked me what the hell was wrong with me, leaving like that and completely icing her out. I kept myself calm despite how mad I already was, and I told her how insane it was that she thinks she's the victim here. That she taunted me for days over something she knew what really important to me, and then at the crest of it all she made a downright disgusting joke about my girlfriend who has been nothing but kind to her. I told her point blank if she didn't explain exactly why she thought any of that was remotely okay, there was zero chance of us ever being friends again. 

She shut her mouth fast, and looked kind of conflicted before she just blurted out some of the most fanfiction shit I would've read off Tumblr at thirteen.

 ""I'm just pissed off because it should've been me making you cry like that."" Uhhhhhhh???? She then pretty much just word vomited about how jealous she is of Freddie and that she's liked me since grade 12, when I had a date to to our prom (that mind you, was just a date to the prom. We kissed and the date decided that was a nope haha) and she wanted it to be her so bad. 

Safe to say, I don't think I've ever been angrier. I can't remember well what I said, I can't stress this enough, I was *so* angry. I told her something about how bizarre she sounds, that I can't believe she would never tell me and just be a total bitch to me instead. I got a little too loud when telling her I was switching dorms because I refuse to room with her anymore, when an employee respectfully asked me to leave. She tried to follow me out but I told her to fuck off and drove away with a very concerned Freddie. I blocked her on our way home.

I told our friends that witnessed the party the real story, and they all apologized to me. To be fair, they were all pretty wasted at the time of the incident, and probably didn't really realize what was going on. They, and the other friends who weren't there, but I explained it to them also, agreed to cut Ali out of the friend group, and that's just where we are now. 

I'm keeping the ones who berated me at arms length, just for my own sanity right now. Ali's tried to approach me a few times, but it's when I've been with people who know, so they helped me get rid of her quick. 

I'm still very hurt and weirded out. Ali was like a sister to me, and I just can't understand how she could treat me like that when she supposedly liked me for years. But I luckily have Freddie and good friends to keep me upright. Anyways, thank you so much for all the support on the last post, and have a good night!",1,1738985309.0,u_JadedScallion995,0,1.0,False

I don’t know where to start with this one. Maybe it’s the exhaustion, maybe it’s the fact that I haven’t eaten a proper meal in over 48 hours, or maybe it’s because I’m just too fucking tired to think straight. Either way, I need to get this shit down while it’s still fresh.  

Sochraina City is ours. That’s the important part. It’s the first real, proper city we’ve taken since the war started, and somehow, against all odds, it still looks like a city. That’s the part I can’t wrap my head around. Every other warzone I’ve ever been in—every goddamn urban battle I’ve fought—has left places looking like they got sent through a meat grinder. But here? Yeah, there’s bullet holes in the walls, there’s a few wrecked cars and a blown-out checkpoint, but when you look at it from above, it still looks like Sochraina.  

The buildings are still standing. The marketplace is still intact. Hell, the fucking coffee shop still has its sign up.  

I don’t know if that’s a miracle or a warning.  

We landed at 0200 hours, right outside the western military checkpoint. The birds dropped us off, and we hit the dirt running. It was cold as hell, even through the gear, that kind of ocean cold that gets into your bones. The air smelled like salt and wet concrete. No gunfire yet. The Patriots of Democracy and the Ronograd Liberation Front were asleep at their posts, totally unaware that a coalition of pissed-off special operations teams was about to rip their little empire apart.  

We had the best of the best for this one. Delta, SAS, Russian Spetsnaz, and the Aussie SASR boys. Four of the meanest, toughest groups of motherfuckers on the planet, all working together like some kind of grim international all-star team. Everyone had their jobs. The Spetsnaz rigged charges at the checkpoints, getting ready to crack them open like beer cans. The SAS and SASR covered the perimeter, making sure no one slipped out. My guys? We were the first ones in.  

The first explosion went off at 0215. The quiet, sleeping city became a goddamn warzone in the blink of an eye. One second, the PoD and RLF were dreaming about their bullshit revolution, and the next, they were waking up to the sound of shattering concrete and screaming alarms. The first checkpoint was gone. The second wouldn’t last much longer.  

The first wave went smoothly. Too smoothly. We blew through the defenses at the edge of the city like they weren’t even there. I almost let myself think this was going to be easy.  

Then we hit the marketplace.  

The marketplace was the heart of Sochraina, a cluster of two-story buildings, little alleyways, and open-air stalls that had probably once been full of life. Now, it was a goddamn kill box. We entered cautiously, weapons up, moving between stalls filled with rotting fruit and overturned furniture. And then, the fucking sky lit up with tracer fire.  

Machine guns from the second-floor windows. Heavy-caliber rounds ripping through market stalls, sending produce and debris flying. A team of PoD gunners had turned the coffee shop into a goddamn pillbox. I heard one of my guys swear before we dove for cover behind a wrecked truck. Bullets pinged off the metal, sending sparks flying in the night.  

I saw Sergeant Monroe peek out for a split second, then drop two of the gunners with that ridiculous speed he always had. Barnes, our demolitions guy, pulled a grenade off his rig and lobbed it through the café window. One second later—boom. The gunfire stopped.  

We started pushing forward. The Russians swept in from the south, kicking down doors and clearing alleyways with their usual brutality. I watched one of them breach a building by literally kicking a guy back into his own doorway and shooting him mid-fall. I won’t lie, it was impressive.  

We secured the market. The PoD were either dead or scattered, the RLF guys surrendering in little pockets here and there. I started thinking, hey, maybe this won’t be so bad. Maybe we’ll get through this one without a major fight.  

And then the mortars hit.  

The first round landed in the square, sending a shockwave through the ground that rattled my teeth. I saw a guy get thrown six feet through the air, hitting the pavement like a ragdoll. The next round hit closer, showering us in dust and debris. I could barely hear over the ringing in my ears, but I knew exactly what was happening. Those motherfuckers had mortar teams set up somewhere south of us. If we didn’t take them out fast, they were going to bomb us into the dirt.  

I grabbed Monroe and Barnes, and we sprinted through the alleys, kicking in doors and running through people’s goddamn kitchens to get to higher ground. We climbed up to the second floor of the coffee shop, rifles up, scanning for the source of the fire. And there they were—three mortar teams, frantically reloading their tubes, completely unaware that we had just lined them up in our sights.  

I keyed my radio. Overlord was ready.  

Less than a minute later, a pair of JDAMs came screaming in from above, hitting the waterfront like the wrath of God. A wall of fire and debris rose up, and just like that, no more mortars.  

That should have been it. That should have been the end of it. But there was still one last fight waiting for us.  

The waterfront was where the real PoD hardliners had dug in. They weren’t like the RLF, who were mostly defected Russian military guys looking for a way out. The PoD were the ones who actually believed in their insane, bastardized version of democracy, and they weren’t about to go quietly. They were holed up behind Mi-8 helicopters and radar panels, using the structures as cover. Every single one of them was prepared to die.  

And most of them did.  

The final push to the pier was ugly. Close-quarters, brutal, hand-to-hand in some cases. Some of the Aussies came in from the lighthouse, providing some sniper fire while we pushed from the front. I saw a RLF fighter get shot by the Aussies and another one charge us with a goddamn machete. We gunned him down before he got close, but Jesus Christ. These people were insane.  

Then came the moment that sealed it.  

The PoD command staff tried to escape. An Mi-8 on the pier, rotors spinning up, ready to get the hell out. If they made it, the war would drag on for months. I called for air support, but comms were jammed. No time to think. I grabbed an RPG off a dead RLF fighter, steadied it, and fired that sucker.  

The rocket slammed into the Mi-8’s tail rotor. The whole thing spun out of control, crashing into the pier in a massive fireball.  

And that was it.  

By 0400 hours, Sochraina belonged to us.  

The craziest part? The city still stood. Unlike every other urban battle I’d fought, Sochraina didn’t turn into a wasteland. The marketplace, the buildings, even the little alleyways—mostly untouched. Sure, the waterfront and the pier were a mess, but the rest of it? The civilians were still here. They were watching us from their windows, some in shock, some in quiet relief.  

I don’t know what comes next. The war isn’t over. We still have Ronograd City, Fort Ronograd, the naval base. And I know, deep down, those battles won’t be like this one. Ronograd’s going to burn.  

But for now, at least, we’ve got one victory that actually looks like a victory.  

End log.

1ikdoxr,https://i.redd.it/4fcne8e72uhe1.jpeg,Reviewing my Sorce collection as someone entirely new to indie fragrances,"
Let me set the scene. It was like… three weeks ago. I was causally scrolling Facebook Marketplace, as one does when one has too much money and not enough hobbies. I see a listing for a cute little green perfume called Match Made In Heaven being listed for $60, which seemed like an ungodly amount for such a small bottle. 


But I’m not smart. 


So I message the girl with a little bit of a lowball. After a few days, she accepts the offer. I drive about an hour to secure the goods and once I get the bottle in my hands, I take a whiff and nearly collapse out of my chair (which was difficult because I was sitting in my car). 


Wow. 


**Match Made in Heaven** is so. Fucking. Good. She’s a visionary. A goddess. The smell I’ve always wanted to smell like. MMIH reminds me of those cool, indie, hipster girls I have pictured being if I could just stop being so awkward for like one god damn second. 


I was transformed. 


I suddenly started looking up All Things Sorce. Then Hex. Then BPAL. The rabbit hole is actually a labyrinth, it seems. Like many people with ADHD, I became hyperfixated. It’s like my brain broke and I was in a trance. Did I purchase every single Sorce thing I could get my grubby little hands on? Yes. 


My bank account is crying. 


So, here’s my review of everything I’ve purchased thus far. I have a few other things in the mail on their way to me right now, but that’s none of our business for this review. I also already regifted two Sorce things, which I will include in the reviews but aren’t in the picture because they are in the mail on the way to their new home. 


I will say, I am extremely new to Indie fragrances. In fact, before… Three weeks ago, I knew almost nothing of the indie/niche fragrance world. I still know very little, but I’m financially committed to learning. 


Anyway, the reviews. This is long. I’m sorry. You’re welcome. 


 🍵 **Match Made In Heaven (100/10)**- As previously mentioned, she is truly That Girl. I want to drink it. I want to wear it on my wedding day, which makes my husband of five years nervous. It smells ethereal, like it was bottled by really cool angels. I love it so much, and I love *myself* when I’m wearing it. I feel like the main character when I douse myself in this magical fragrance. Nobody has complimented me on it but honestly, that feels like an indictment on everyone else. 


🐍  **Serpentine (6/10)** - I’m afraid I don’t love this one as much. Based on the notes, I thought this would make me feel like a sexy fig. But it actually just makes me feel like a regular fig. Which is fine, if you’re into that kind of thing. On me, it smells pretty… Sharp? I wore it once to the gym and I felt really insecure about how sour I smelled. I kept getting whiff of Serpentine, and hoped the person on the treadmill next to me knew that it was fig scented, and I didn’t just roll around in a big box of Sour Patch Kids. I’m actually going to try to sell this one because I’m sure there are people who absolutely love it, and those people are not me. I do really like the scent, I just don’t want to smell like it. If that makes any sense.


🍰 **The Ghost Wants Birthday Cake (10/10** - This is going to make me sound insane, but I’m going to share it anyway because Reddit is anonymous and only God can judge me. The little ghost holding the cake with the party hat? The art on the bottle? It actually made me cry. I don’t know why, it’s just so sweet and sad. Who is this ghost? Why does he want the cake? Why can’t he have cake? Who is stopping him? I have so many questions and no answers. Anyway, I love how this smells. I’m actually afraid to use it because I don’t want to ever get rid of this bottle, it’s so cute. But as far as the actual fragrance, I love it. It’s peachy. It’s bright, it’s delightful. It’s exactly what you think it will smell like when you read the notes and exactly what you want it to smell like if the notes sound appealing to you. 10/10 for scent, expectation-meeting, and that god damned cute ass ghost friend.


🍈 **Sit for a Spell (6/10)** - I don’t know what salted cantaloupe is. Is that really a thing? Are people putting salt on cantaloupe? I know people put salt on watermelon, but cantaloupe? I learn something new every day. This one has a little bit of a sharpness in the opening note that I’m not absolutely in love with, but it is lovely if you’re a fan of very ripe cantaloupe. That being said, I don’t think I will buy it again and it’s not my favorite. I could see this being a lovely and bright and even nostalgic scent for people who know what salted cantaloupe tastes like, but I’m not one of those people.


🧁 **A Party, Or Something (8/10)** - To me, this smells like vanilla cupcakes right out of the oven. Before you add frosting or any accessories, just imagine sticking your nose directly into a freshly baked vanilla cupcake and whiffing. It’s a bit of an addictive smell, but unfortunately, I got the rollerball version and I hate rollerballs. So I have to aggressively smell my own skin in order to get the scent. But I could see really loving this as an actual spray perfume. Very simple, photorealistic vanilla cupcake.


🍓 **Where the Wild Things Grow (8/10)** - This one is very, very strawberry. But what’s interesting is, after wearing it a bit, it gets a little more complex. It smells like a strawberry with its vine. Like a strawberry that you’d find in nature, if such a thing existed. Kind of earthy in addition to being incredibly sweet. I’m fascinated by how the Sorce people were able to capture the essence of an earthy Strawberry *plus* its vine. Very cool. 


⛈️ **Dark Skies (0/10)** - This is where Sorce stans are going to get mad at me. I bought this as a rollerball and upon opening it, it had a sharp, metallic, acrid stank that I did not fuck with one bit. Because I had just paid hard-earned cash for it, I put it on my skin and it got a little better. Earthy, woodsy, not terrible. But my god. That opening note was awful and I honestly thought the girl I bought it from sold me expired goods. I did some researching online and nobody else was complaining about the pungentness of it, so I ended up sending it to another Redditor to see if she would like it or not and told her to just throw it away if it smelled as bad to her as it did to me. As I was packaging it up to send it to her, I pulled off some packing tape and thought that I had spilled the Dark Skies, and I realized that it smelled EXACTLY like the packing tape to me. That sharp, acrid, packing tape stank. 


💡 **String of Lights in the Forest (2/10)** - I also gave this one to the fellow Redditor because I didn’t vibe with it. I don’t remember exactly why because I have the memory of a distracted goldfish, but it was another issue of the opening note being not for me. I’m so sorry for back to back bad reviews, but I figured we should get them out of the way.

💜 **Moon Magic (7/10)** - This one, to me, smells like sniffing a sprig of lavender while chewing on cinnamon bubble gum. It’s lavendery and spicy and nice. I could see myself going absolutely bananas for this if I loved lavender more.

☕️ **Falling Stars (Marshmallow Cloud) (7/10)** - I’m a little bit confused why it’s called marshmallow cloud, because to me this smells like a chocolate cookie dipped in black coffee. I don’t dislike it, but it’s not necessarily something I want to smell like.

🍪 **Falling Stars (Cookie Butter) (8/10)** - This smells like a lightly cinnamony Nutter Butter cookie dipped in black coffee, in a good way. 

🍊 **Falling Stars (Cardamom Orange and Brown Sugar) (8/10)** - This smells like one of those chocolate oranges that we all eat at Christmas for some reason. It’s really nice and zesty but also rich and chocolatey. Makes me hungry tbh and now I wish it was Christmas. 

Thank you for letting me share my reviews. I love this brand and I’m so excited to keep trying new Sorce and indie fragrances. If you have any suggestions of things I should try based on what I loved and hated, please let me know ☺️",28,1738984656.0,Indiemakeupandmore,8,1.0,False

#Truth Bullets

[Nanami File](#bullet) The victim is Byakuya Togami. Probably. Byakuya should have died at, maybe…10:35PM…ish? I think?

[Mikan's Autopsy](#bullet) The cause of death is suffocation from blood filling his lungs due to a stab to the neck. The death was within less than a minute. Yes, it was Byakuya Togami. 10:35PM matches what Mikan concluded from her analysis.

[DICE Directive #1 - The Friend Ship](#bullet) What ship never sinks? That’s right! The Friend Ship! Unfortunately, Hope’s Peak isn’t friendship, it’s a building, and it’s filling up with water with every passing moment. In an undetermined amount of time the entire school will be submerged. Unless…

[Adaptation is Key](#bullet) As the first floor was submerged, the astute staff working hard at DICE realized certain necessary faculties were no longer accessible. The fifth floor biology lab was converted into a room with a kitchen area and a dining area. Showers and additional sinks have been added to each communal bathroom on their respective floors. The Physics Lab on the fourth floor was turned into a theater room. Lastly, all classrooms are equipped with a basic lock that can only be locked from the inside.

[Byakuya's Adapted Library](#bullet) The library showed clear signs of Byakuya modifying to his personal preferences, with furniture shifted and personal items scattered. Some include the many books stacked on the table, a corner to write with a notebook and pens, another to sit and listen to vinyl records, and another for snacking and drinking. One particular modification is that there was originally a small glass vase on the front counter, but now only shattered pieces remain.  
 
[The Archives](#bullet) Byakuya repurposed the Archives, a room inside the Library, to become his sleeping quarters. The walls are lined up with shelves almost fully packed with volumes to long encyclopedias, each row being a different edition. Seemingly, the last book on one of the rows is missing. There is a sleeping bag on the floor and a small coffee table. The door to the Archives can be locked from the inside and showed no signs of tampering. 

[Uneven Coffee Table](#bullet) The coffee table inside the Archives had one of the four legs broken, needing about three inches to balance. Byakuya placed the twenty-first volume of The DICE-Revised Universal Compendium of All Knowledge™️ under the leg to fix this problem.

[Slumber Party Massacre](#bullet) Rooms are less plentiful as the school fills with water ~ so people had to get creative with sleeping arrangements. The following people have confirmed their location of rest (courtesy sleeping bags and pillows provided by DICE): 

Byakuya - Archives

Ibuki + Himiko - Classroom 2A

Mondo + Chihiro - Classroom 2B

Komaru + Mikan - Classroom 3A

Yasuhiro + Gundham - Classroom 3B

Mukuro - Classroom 4A

Kaede + Maki + Kaito - Classroom 4B

Kirumi + Angie - Classroom 5A

Korekiyo - Classroom 5B

Fuyuhiko - Classroom 5C

[Idle Hands are the Devil’s Workshop](#bullet) At 8:00 AM this morning DICE sent a personalized message to every student. It indicated that their orientation period has finished and they are now to begin the training program in earnest. Each student was given a list of tasks unique to them that must be completed before midnight unless they were tired of that whole “living” thing.

[Isolation](#bullet) Upon finding out they were being ~~forced~~ invited into a DICE Killing Game, most of the class used this as a chance to unify. Byakuya was not one of those people. Shortly after the situation was apparent to all, Byakuya claimed the library for himself and would only occasionally leave for minimum periods of time for necessities such as going to the bathroom. 

[Body Discovery](#bullet) Shortly after 11 PM a loud noise sounding like glass shattering was heard coming from the library. Ibuki, Himiko, Chihiro, and Mondo followed the noise and found the library unlocked. They found Byakuya’s corpse after walking into the library and noticing the scent of blood from the Archives room. Upon seeing the corpse the body discovery announcement rang out (11:20 PM) and the remaining class members arrived shortly after. 

[Crime Scene](#bullet) Byakuya was found in the library archive lying face down head towards the door. Blood can be found on his neck where the stab wound was made and a trail can be observed from his sleeping bag to the door. Blood is on his hands and the door knob. 

[Knives Out](#bullet) A knife was found at the scene of the crime next to Byakuya’s body. The knife has stains of blood on the blade.

[Missing Glue](#bullet) Angie noticed that Fast Acting Glue went missing from the art room at 3:30pm. 

[All the World’s a Stage](#bullet) Chiaki and Kokichi confirm that Byakuya's task was to do public dramatic readings. From 3:30-5:00 PM  Byakuya performed different renditions of Shakespeare to the absolute delight of Kokichi. Chiaki and Komaru were there as well.

[Maintenance Issues](#bullet) Korekiyo investigated the Chemistry Lab and something seems to be clogging the drain of the sink.

[Stuck Books](#bullet) Gundham attempted to move some of the books on a shelf of the Archives and was unable to dislodge any book in the row whatsoever.

[Glass Pieces](#bullet) Fuyuhiko tried to gather the scattered glass shards. He used a book to transport the pieces but quickly abandoned the idea when the jagged edges began slicing into the book’s cover with minimal pressure.

[Kirumi's Testimony](#bullet) Kirumi claims that her task entailed cooking a lot of food, so she kept the Kitchen (Biology Lab) occupied from 7:45AM to 10PM. She can testify that Kaito, Maki, Ibuki, Yasuhiro, Komaru, Gundham, Angie, and Himiko, and only these people, entered the kitchen at various times outside of usual meal hours, when the kitchen was not off-limits.

[Knife Holder](#bullet) The kitchen knives are stored in a stand affixed to the countertop, but one of the knives is missing. The object is coated with water on the outside.
 
[Ibuki's Testimony](#bullet) During investigation, Ibuki was investigating the kitchen, and while handling the knife holder, accidentally let her ring fall inside one of the slits. She tried several methods to get it out, but she couldn't find a way into the opening. 

[Mukuro and Maki’s Testimony](#bullet) During their investigation, Mukuro and Maki discussed the possibility of hiding in the Archives. They confirmed that the entrance offered a clear view of all corners. Although they identified a way for a makeshift stack of books to possibly conceal someone, it would stand out enough to arouse suspicion.

[Kitchen Fire](#bullet) Kaito was attempting to cook a very masculine strawberry cake with pink frosting before one thing led to another and (in what could have happened to anyone) started a kitchen fire around 10:30 PM causing the sprinklers to douse the room in water. Maki discovered the commotion and was appropriately disappointed in him. They left the room about fifteen minutes after, with permission from Chiaki, as the room would fix itself overnight.

20F 158cm & 70kg at my heaviest (fluctuates like crazy between 58kg-70kg)
I know I’m overweight but I was kinda chilling because I looked average.

Genetic background:

No one on my father’s side has diabetes despite some being obese. And I thought I took after them (farmer build)(ancestors were farmers).

And while on my mother’s side my grandfather & aunty are diabetic, it’s type one diabetes so I thought I was in the clear 😭. I don’t have that nomad build either (skinny wrists)(ancestors were nomadic pastoralists).

Fitness/diet background:

For the past three years I have been extremely inactive, with zero exercise outside of necessary walking. 

My daily diet is basically cereal for breakfast (corn flakes, nutri-grain or Rice Bubbles) & refilling it until the milk drains. Sometimes instead of cereal I’ll have milk/milktea with biscuits.

No lunch but If I’m at uni I get Bubble tea 50% less sugar. Then dinner is usually rice or bread, cucumber & tomato salad, and a stew with meat or some vegetables. I also had desert practically everyday.

I don’t know anything about healthy eating but I could guess that the giant cereal breakfast wasn’t the best for me. Regardless, I was chilling.

What i’m doing now:
(idk if it’s enough)

Ofc I’m freaking out now, but I don’t know if I’m freaking out enough. Are the changes I’m making too little?

I’ve cut out added sugar. But I’ve had a dessert once a week. And I eat a lot of fruit. Multiple Grapefruits almost everyday, & have homemade guava juice, & Mangos often.

Is the occasional dessert too much & Should I be avoiding fruit?

I drink tea/coffee almost daily, & i add stevia. 

For breakfast no cereal but occasionally still have milk with traditional biscuits. Usually have flat bread with fava beans & thyme with yoghurt cheese. All dowsed in a ton of olive oil and each bite eaten with the flat bread.

I’ve just continued to eat with bread in the traditional style & I’m concerned that I should be cutting it out completely. And I’m concerned about the olive oil being high calorie when I need to be losing fat.

For dinner I have rice, salad, and traditional stews like jute leaves, lentil soup, etc. like once a week the food is more unhealthy like fast food.

For exercise I plan on regularly going to the gym (I’ve only gone twice so far but trust 😭 I just need to get a coach/personal trainer for a session or two)

A few years ago I saw her for the first time (M). It was her birthday (M) at a nearby cafe that I liked to go to after school. I remember it like it was yesterday, blonde hair, long dress and unforgettable beauty. I didn't know who she was at the time or how old she was or what she was like and so on but I told myself I had to meet her. I saw that there was a girl (A) there who I can't say is my friend but rather an acquaintance. I went to her profile and saw a picture of the two of them, I immediately sent her a request (M) and didn't hesitate. She accepted and that was it. About a year passed after that where I didn't write anything to her, I even forgot about her to some extent but every time I saw her at the end, it was like my heart skipped a beat. I looked for a way to talk to her but after a while I gave up on that idea and moved on with my life. I met a nice girl (E) not long after that and we corresponded for a long time. I saw that she was friends with (M) and that's how I started a conversation. I joined her chat and we started to correspond intensively. After a while I asked her if she knew this girl (E) and if she could help me with her, to which she said she did and from the way she wrote I could tell that she seemed a little disappointed. I didn't know why but I just shrugged it off. She tried to help me by telling her friend (E) that she and I were friends and that I was a really good guy, nice and so on. We continued to correspond (me and E) and not long after that we saw each other.
It went okay, but I felt that there wasn't any excessive connection. After the date she told me I was great but that she didn't think we should have anything more than that because she didn't see me that way. I was a little tired after that, but she wasn't that important to me so I easily got over it. After about a month, she texted me (M) and asked how it went, to which I told her everything that had happened. She told me she was sorry she hadn't helped more, to which I said it didn't matter because I certainly couldn't make her like me. We continued to text (M and I) and got to know each other more and more. We had a lot in common, in fact it was like I was talking to someone I'd known my whole life. After a few days we agreed to go out into the city, have a meal and have coffee. Although I didn't think it was a date, it felt like one and I prepared myself well. As I walked to the place where we were supposed to meet, for the first time I had a strange feeling in my stomach, I can't say it was pleasant, it was a little nauseating, but somehow I was glad it was there. We met and went to the place where we were supposed to eat. The whole time we were sitting, talking, and laughing, I still had that feeling in my stomach and it was like I was falling in love with this girl in some way. From her behavior and appearance, I noticed that this date meant more to her than, for example, a classic date, so it clicked a little bit for me why she was disappointed when I asked her about her friend (E). Maybe she likes me? I thought about it while I was talking to her and these thoughts flooded my head. We started walking in the park after eating. She was beautiful. Her aura seemed different from everyone else's. We walked a bit and after a while we sat down at a monument. Although there was plenty of space, we sat next to each other, squeezed together as if there was no more room to sit. I would have felt uncomfortable and uneasy in that situation, but not with her. We talked until at one point she leaned her head on me. I was speechless and my heart started beating really fast. She asked me if I minded what she did, to which I just said no, I don’t mind. We sat like that in silence for 15-20 minutes and looked at the sky. I put one arm around her waist. I was scared of what her reaction would be, but she just grabbed my hand (hand) and held it. That evening we kissed. I usually avoid doing that, especially with people I’ve just met, but I trusted her. Something set her apart from the others.
We started dating, a little quickly but it was okay. We got to know each other and figured things out. The more time I spent with her, the more convinced I was that she was the one. We were together for a little over a year. It was wonderful, although we often argued. It would usually start with me joking with her, and she would get angry and it would turn into a small fight. I really loved her more than anything, but something was against it. Summer came. We argued more than ever about stupid things. I couldn't take it anymore and I told her I needed a little break. Even though I didn't want to do it, I had to. We had been out of touch for over a month. I still saw her but we didn't talk. Finally, I thought about it and asked her to talk. We sat down near the football stadium, and we started talking. I said what I felt and what my problem was, and so did she. We agreed to try again but that we had to fix it. And here we were, together again.The first month was nice, really nice and I felt happier than ever. However, we started further education where I met new people and different people and I paid less and less attention to her, and after a while we broke up. My immaturity led to me talking all sorts of things about her and in doing so I hurt her a lot. I made her life miserable, which at that moment I didn't think would happen. After a short time, I got into a relationship with a friend from school and we were only together for two months. I didn't need that relationship at all because the girl was really bad. She did all sorts of things and was really toxic. When I broke up with her, and after a while I realized that (M) is all I need in life to be happy. I wanted to get in touch with her again to fix everything. To go back to the old days and continue what we started.
Then I saw her. I was walking home alone. I saw her with another guy. She seemed happy, but it was like she wasn’t completely happy with him. Her boyfriend and I know each other, from different circles. He’s an okay guy. A little annoying, but he’s okay. My heart broke when I saw them. I told myself I wasn’t going to ruin anything she had with him, and that’s how it was for the next year and a half. Not a day went by that I didn’t think about her.
And so the new summer came. I talked to a friend about it because I needed to tell someone, to have someone listen to me, and she told me I should forget about it. To let her go and be happy. That’s what I did. On vacation, I visited a sacred place where I lit a candle for her and prayed that she would be happy and have everything she needed in life. It helped. I stopped thinking about her and after four months I met a beautiful girl (A) with whom I have been together for 6 months. I feel good with her and I tried to be as nice as possible to her. We never argued in all the time we were together and I always did everything I could to make her feel better.
Everything was great, until I heard from my sister that they had broken up (M and her new boyfriend). As if through a flashback, everything came back to me in a second. I hadn't forgotten anything about her, but it was as if I was just covering it up and trying to forget.
I tried to convince myself that I had a beautiful girl by my side (A) and that I shouldn't think about (M) anymore and that it was in the past. But with little success. I loved her too much to forget about her. I got in touch with (M). I asked her how she was and what she was doing. She seemed colder than ever. I could understand why that was. I wasn't the best person to her after we broke up. We talked, or I talked, and she would respond briefly. I asked her if we could talk if it wasn't a problem, to which she said we could over the phone if I wanted because she didn't want to see me while I had a girlfriend. I told her everything that was on my mind. We talked for 2 days straight. We covered a lot of topics because we hadn't talked in a long time. She said she still had feelings for me but that she still hated me for everything I did. After all that, I never got that feeling in my stomach with anyone else but her. Even now that we've been texting, it's the same feeling in my stomach as the first time. She must be special, right?
We're still in touch even though I'm in a ""happy"" relationship. I want to break up with (A) but I think it would be the wrong decision because she's a really good girl and I don't have the heart to do that to her, but this way I'm only making the situation worse because I'm talking to my ex (M) behind her back. I'm getting more and more inclined to tell her everything, and just when I'm ready, I see her and everything falls apart. She's too good a person to do something like that to her. That thought has crossed my mind 1000 times. I don't know what to do, so if you have any advice, feel free to write.
And yes, I know, we men are trash.

# Mother Teresa: Saint or Shrewd Operator? A Critical Examination of the Accusations

Mother Teresa, the Albanian-Indian nun who dedicated her life to serving the poorest of the poor in Calcutta, remains a figure of both immense admiration and considerable controversy. While she was lauded globally for her charitable work and awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1979, a growing chorus of critics has emerged, questioning her motives, methods, and the actual impact of her work. This article aims to delve into the main criticisms leveled against Mother Teresa, examining the evidence and arguments both for and against these accusations.

To ensure a balanced and comprehensive analysis, this investigation involved a multi-step research process. First, a variety of sources were consulted, including articles, books, and online forums, to gather diverse perspectives on Mother Teresa's life and work. These sources were carefully evaluated for their credibility and objectivity, with an emphasis on including both critical and supportive viewpoints. Special attention was given to incorporating firsthand accounts and testimonies from individuals who had direct experience with Mother Teresa and her missions. This multifaceted approach aimed to provide a nuanced and well-rounded understanding of the controversies surrounding this iconic figure.

# Defenses of Mother Teresa

Before delving into the criticisms, it's essential to understand the core principles that guided Mother Teresa's work and the arguments presented by her supporters.

* Focus on Dignity and Compassion: Defenders argue that Mother Teresa's primary aim was to provide love, comfort, and dignity to those abandoned by society, offering them a place to die in peace. Her homes were not intended to be hospitals but rather sanctuaries for the destitute and dying12. As Navin B. Chawla, her biographer, points out, she aimed to create a space where those refused admittance elsewhere ""could at least die being comforted and with some dignity."" 3
* Limited Resources and Challenging Circumstances: Supporters acknowledge the limitations in medical care but point to the challenging circumstances in which Mother Teresa operated, with scarce resources and overwhelming need1. They argue that she did the best she could with what she had, and her efforts should be viewed within that context. One Reddit user aptly describes it as a ""robin hood type situation,"" where she took money from those causing the problem and used it to help the ""undesirables."" 4
* Spiritual Dimension of Suffering: Defenders explain that Mother Teresa's views on suffering were rooted in her deep Catholic faith, which emphasizes the redemptive value of suffering when united with Christ's passion2. They argue that her intention was not to glorify suffering but to offer spiritual solace and meaning to those experiencing it. This perspective is reflected in the Catechism of the Catholic Church, which states that suffering ""acquires a new meaning; it becomes a participation in the saving work of Jesus."" 2

# Criticisms of Mother Teresa

Despite the noble intentions and the undeniable impact of her work, Mother Teresa has faced numerous criticisms, raising questions about her methods, motivations, and the true nature of her legacy.

* Substandard Medical Care: Critics argue that the medical care provided in her homes for the dying was woefully inadequate, lacking proper hygiene, qualified medical personnel, and essential pain relief533. Canadian academics Serge Larivée, Geneviève Chénard, and Carole Sénéchal noted that despite receiving millions in donations, her clinics ""lacked medical care, systematic diagnosis, necessary nutrition, and sufficient analgesics for those in pain."" 3 These accounts raise concerns about the prioritization of religious conversion over palliative care and pain management67.
* Questionable Financial Practices: Concerns have been raised about the lack of transparency in the Missionaries of Charity's finances and the alleged misuse of funds7. Mother Teresa received millions of dollars in donations, yet the conditions in her facilities remained poor, raising questions about where the money went6. Furthermore, her acceptance of donations from controversial figures like Charles Keating, a convicted fraudster, drew criticism87. When informed of the harm Keating caused, she refused to return the money, which could have been used to help those he defrauded1.
* Glorification of Suffering: Critics accuse Mother Teresa of romanticizing suffering as a means to spiritual salvation, rather than actively seeking to alleviate it67. Her statement, ""I think it is very beautiful for the poor to accept their lot, to share it with the passion of Christ,"" 7 has been interpreted as a callous disregard for the plight of the poor. This view is further reinforced by her reported reluctance to administer strong painkillers to those in her care1. In one account, cancer patients were given aspirin instead of morphine1.
* Coercive Conversions: Allegations have surfaced that Mother Teresa and her nuns engaged in baptizing the dying without their explicit consent or knowledge64. This practice has been condemned as a violation of personal autonomy and religious freedom, particularly when targeting vulnerable individuals in their final moments. Mother Teresa herself is said to have bragged about these conversions9.
* Opposition to Contraception and Abortion: Mother Teresa's staunch opposition to contraception and abortion has been criticized as contributing to overpopulation and poverty, particularly in developing countries3. Her statement that abortion is the ""greatest destroyer of peace"" 10 sparked controversy and drew criticism from women's rights groups. Barbara Smoker, of the secular humanist magazine The Freethinker, argued that Mother Teresa's promotion of these views diverted funds from more effective solutions to India's problems3.

# Political and Social Views

Beyond her work with the poor, Mother Teresa's political and social stances have also drawn criticism.

* Alignment with Authoritarian Regimes: Mother Teresa was criticized for accepting awards and donations from dictators like the Duvaliers in Haiti, seemingly condoning their oppressive regimes11.
* Silence on Forced Sterilization: She faced scrutiny for her perceived lack of public criticism of Indira Gandhi's forced sterilization policies in India, despite being vocal about other issues related to women and children1.
* Opposition to Vatican II Reforms: During the Second Vatican Council, Mother Teresa opposed proposed reforms, maintaining an ""ultra-reactionary and fundamentalist"" position10. This suggests a potential conflict with progressive elements within the Church.

# Treatment of Nuns

Criticisms extend to Mother Teresa's leadership style and the treatment of nuns within her order.

* Authoritarian Practices: Former nun Colette Livermore described Mother Teresa's leadership as dictatorial, with strict control over the nuns' lives, including reading their personal mail and restricting communication with family810.
* Emphasis on Austerity and Obedience: Livermore also criticized the emphasis on austerity and unquestioning obedience within the order, citing examples like forbidding nuns from using a washing machine in Manila10. This raises concerns about the potential for exploitation and the prioritization of religious dogma over the well-being of the nuns.

# Neo-colonialism and Cultural Impact

Some critics argue that Mother Teresa's work, while seemingly benevolent, had unintended negative consequences.

* White Savior Complex: Her approach has been criticized for perpetuating the ""white savior"" narrative, with a Western figure being lauded for ""saving"" people in a non-white country9.
* Cultural Neglect: Critics argue that Mother Teresa's focus on conversion and Western Christianity neglected the rich cultural and intellectual life of Kolkata9.

# Analysis and Judgment

Evaluating the criticisms against Mother Teresa requires a nuanced approach that considers the historical context, cultural sensitivities, and the complexities of her work. While some accusations, such as the substandard medical care, appear to have merit, others, like the claims of deliberate cruelty, seem less substantiated.

It is undeniable that the medical facilities run by the Missionaries of Charity often lacked proper resources and qualified personnel. However, it is also important to recognize the overwhelming poverty and lack of infrastructure in Calcutta, which made it challenging to provide high-quality medical care to all those in need. Mother Teresa's focus on providing basic care, comfort, and spiritual support should be viewed within this context.

The controversy surrounding her views on suffering is more complex. While her emphasis on the spiritual dimension of suffering may be difficult for some to reconcile with the need for pain relief and medical intervention, it was deeply rooted in her religious beliefs. It is crucial to avoid imposing modern secular values on a figure whose worldview was shaped by faith and tradition. However, the apparent contradiction between her acceptance of suffering for the poor and her own pursuit of quality medical care raises questions about potential hypocrisy107.

The allegations of coercive conversions and questionable financial practices raise more serious concerns. While it is difficult to ascertain the extent to which these practices occurred, they warrant further investigation and scrutiny.

Furthermore, it's crucial to examine the potential conflict between Mother Teresa's charitable work and her conservative religious views, particularly regarding contraception and women's rights310. Her opposition to these measures, while aligned with Catholic doctrine, could be seen as hindering efforts to address poverty and empower women in the long term.

# Spiritual Struggles and Their Impact

Mother Teresa's personal writings reveal a profound inner struggle, a ""dark night of the soul"" where she experienced doubt, despair, and a sense of God's absence12. This spiritual turmoil lasted for decades and raises questions about how it might have influenced her views on suffering and service. Did her own experience of darkness contribute to her acceptance of suffering in others? Did it fuel her desire to offer spiritual solace as a primary form of comfort? These questions warrant further exploration and add another layer of complexity to understanding Mother Teresa's motivations and worldview.

# Conclusion

Mother Teresa's life and work continue to generate debate and inspire strong opinions. While she was undoubtedly a compassionate individual who brought comfort and care to many, she was also a controversial figure whose actions and beliefs were not without fault. This article has attempted to present a balanced and evidence-based analysis of the criticisms leveled against her, acknowledging both the validity of some accusations and the need for nuanced understanding of her motivations and context.

Ultimately, Mother Teresa's legacy remains a complex tapestry woven with threads of genuine compassion, unwavering faith, and questionable practices that deserve critical examination. Her story serves as a reminder of the complexities of humanitarian work and the challenges of reconciling faith, ideology, and the practical realities of alleviating suffering. It also highlights the importance of critical examination, even when evaluating individuals who are widely revered.

Further research could delve deeper into the financial practices of the Missionaries of Charity, the extent of coercive conversions, and the long-term impact of Mother Teresa's work on the communities she served. Additionally, exploring the psychological and spiritual implications of her ""dark night of the soul"" could provide valuable insights into her worldview and motivations. Mother Teresa's story continues to be relevant in contemporary discussions about faith, charity, and the role of religion in addressing poverty and suffering.

1ikdh26,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fantasy/comments/1ikdh26/review_legends_lattes_by_travis_baldree/,Review: Legends & Lattes by Travis Baldree,"Hi all, your local Cult is back with a new review, this time I'm touching upon my first ever cozy fantasy and the one that made it a well known genre, **Legends & Lattes!** I hope you enjoy!

**Title:** ***Legends & Lattes (Legends & Lattes book 1)*** by **Travis Baldree**  
**Rating: 5/5**  
**Book Bingo Tags:** ***Prologues & Epilogues, First in a Series, Orc, Trolls, & Goblins OH MY!***  
**Short Review:** The perfect read for a quiet day.

**Full Review:**  
Full disclosure, this is technically a double review as the copy I have came with the prequel short story, ***Pages to Fill***, so I will be including my thoughts on this story here as well.  
I have yet to read a book more D&D-coded than this one, and I say that as a compliment, let's start with why. Viv, our protagonist, is a former orcish adventurer who leaves the life to pursue her dream of opening a gnomish coffee shop, which leads to her coming into contact with a number of interesting characters, though her old life does come to haunt her at times. Other characters that I feel are of note are Tandri; a succubus who becomes the first employee, Avery; a local dire-cat, and Cal; a local hobgoblin carpenter and handyman. All of this wholesome and warm storytelling takes place in the riverside city of Thune, and while the parts of the city we see feel equal parts familiar and new, the city itself doesn't get too much time to shine, the same can be said for what bit's of magic we get. Normally, these would be complaints against the book and writing, but this isn't the subgenre for it as it's more character driven and more personal. So while the book is lore light, it is very much character rich. Now, one of the consistent complaints I've found against this book is about the conflict that Viv and Tandri must contend with. Personally, I felt it was just right, especially if one considers that the stakes are supposed to affect the characters central to the story and not the world that they inhabit, whole world or city. Overall, while I wish there was more exploration of the city and it's lore as well as a bit more of an explanation of the magic system, the story as it unfolds is far and above one of my all-time favourites and I look forward to not only reading the prequel, ***Bookshops & Bonedust***, but also the upcoming sequel, ***Brigands & Breadknives***.

As for the story within ***Pages to Fill***, it's a neat little caper that leads into a deciding moment of Viv's life, it also expands on Viv's relationship to some of her companions during her time as an adventurer. It does expand on a different city, this one being Azimuth, a primarily gnomish city and the caper inside, while short, is fun and reinforces my claim of the story being very D&D-coded. Overall it doesn't take away from the full experience of the book, it adds only a little and gives slight explanation on the inciting events of the core story.

I hope y'all enjoyed the review! How many of you want to read the book now I wonder? With that said, I hope you all look forward to my next review: ***Call of the Bone Ships*** by ***RJ Barker!***

I’m Sean, 38 years old, and I work as a deep-sea diver. I have a passion for adventure, exploring the unknown, and sharing good conversations with interesting people. Whether it's grabbing a coffee, enjoying a nice dinner, or just having a chill chat, I’m open to connecting and seeing where things go.

Someone confident but not cocky, smart but not a know-it-all, and strong but also capable of melting over a cute dog. If you've got emotional intelligence, are openminded, and at least a general idea of how to assemble IKEA furniture, we're off to a good start.

I want a real relationship that exists outside of the confines of the internet —late-night conversations, coffee runs that turn into deep discussions, and road trips where your hand finds my thigh without a second thought. You should be extroverted, left-leaning (or at the very least, not the kind of guy who thinks ""staying out of politics"" is a personality trait), and 100% single-as in, actually over your ex. Personally I’m not at all into anime, video games, board games or metal (music). Bonus points if you appreciate a curvy woman and won't be overwhelmed by the fact that l'm a single mom.

I prefer someone near my age (late 30’s), but l'm not afraid of a little distance as long as you have the availability to actually make something real happen. If you're tall, that definitely helps your case because-fair warning-I'm tall, too. So if you were hoping to be the only one reaching things off the top shelf, think again. We can either battle for dominance in the grocery aisle or accept our fate as the ultimate power couple who never needs a step stool. Your call..

1ikdfla,https://www.reddit.com/r/DrJohnKruse/comments/1ikdfla/neuroplasticity_for_adhd/,Neuroplasticity for ADHD,"

The Cambridge Dictionary defines neuroplasticity as ""the ability of the brain to form new connections and reorganize itself as a reaction to new experiences or information.""

A video on neuroplasticity would be amazing... it's such an interesting topic.  Andrew Huberman has a lot of videos explaining neuroplasticity, in particular the video called ""How to Focus to Change Your Brain""

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LG53Vxum0as)

Andrew Huberman says that neuroplasticity is a process, first you need alertness and focus combined, and then you need to rest.

Alertness involves raising epinephrine levels, focus involves raising acetylcholine levels. (These neurotransmitters need to be released at the same time while doing some activity)

Generally this activity should be about 90 minutes, but after that you need to rest. It could be a nap, meditation, or anything that takes your mind off. Huberman refers to all these relaxing activities as ""non sleep deep rest"" (NSDR)

Neuroplasticity is triggered by intense focus, but neuroplasticity occurs during deep sleep and rest. Alertness+focus combined while doing an activity triggers neuroplasticity, but you need to rest after that, in that period of rest you should relax or sleep and that's when the brain actually changes.

(I wrote this based on many videos by Andrew Huberman)

I think this process works but I have to dedicate an entire day just to learn or practice just ONE skill. It has to be something very specific and the day has to be very organized too.

For example last year I learned to cut down trees using this process. After a good night's sleep, and after taking breakfast and my medication, I spent entire Saturday and Sunday mornings cutting down just ONE tree, drinking a lot of coffee in the morning and also taking a lot of small breaks.

In the afternoon I cleaned everything and also cut down the branches. I went to sleep early too. It might not seem like much, but I finally got to cut down those trees after years of procrastination... I think this is the value of neuroplasticity for ADHD:  it's a great tool to overcome procrastination.

I would like to read your thoughts about neuroplasticity.",1,1738983836.0,DrJohnKruse,0,1.0,False

Thank you!,"Link to copy code, download app, and paste code:\

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ikdcgo,https://i.redd.it/puug2qhzythe1.jpeg,Review #4: Little Book The Infinite,"Distillery: Jim Beam

Age: Officially 7 years; blend of 7, 8, 14, and 20 year bourbons

Proof: 119.3

Background: Got a tip from a buddy of mine a few months back that a local liquor store had a few of these in stock. So I did what any tater would do and skirted out of the parking lot at work to see if the rumors were true. To my surprise, there were still 3 or 4 of these bad boys behind the counter at MSRP. Actually now that I think about it, I scored this bottle on my birthday. A great gift to myself! 

Nose: Strong oak. Leathery, and tannic already.  Classic beam nuttiness and some sweet vanilla and maple syrup. There is significantly more depth in this nose compared to standard Bookers.

Palate: Thick and creamy. Very decadent. Sugary barrel char and oak accompanied by more tannins. Leather and tobacco are dominant notes, and there’s a slight dark chocolate/coffee bitterness. I don’t really get any more of that signature Beam nuttiness on the palate.

Finish: Tobacco, barrel char, very dark chocolate, coffee, with enough sweetness to cut all of the tannins and astringency. Reminiscent of a porter. The depth and richness is really what stands out from pour to finish. Great, long finish that I even get some black tea from as it fades.

Overall: The more I ponder this bottle the more I love it. It’s unique for sure and not quite the classic Beam profile I’m used to. I’m not sure if the barrels used for this batch were extra charred or what, but the prevalence of char in this bottle creates all of these wonderful, dark tasting notes. It may not be for everyone, but as someone who loves cigars, dark chocolate, coffee, black tea, and dark beers, it’s really cool to see all of these notes come together in a bourbon.

My wife has a history of childhood trauma (emotionally, verbally, and physically abusive father), depression, ADHD, etc. I think there some sexual assault as well from her college days, but I’ve never gotten all the details. She also burned out from work a year and a half ago, and left her work. I am a fairly successful professional and primary breadwinner. We never had a super active sex life. It got worse after childbirth, and became non-existent since COVID.

I started going to therapy a little more than a year ago. It’s been incredibly helpful on a lot of fronts, and we’ve started to reconnect emotionally. My therapist (based only on what she’s heard from me) feels that we have a lot of love and a strong marriage with the DB as the one missing piece.

At today’s session with my therapist, I told her that I was really feeling down about the lack of physical intimacy. We talked about it, and she told me that I am too focused on trying to understand what she’s thinking/feeling, and I just need to tell her how it is making me feel. It made a lot of sense, and I am going to do it, though I am still working out how to say it. I am writing a first draft here to help me collect my thoughts. Any advice/thoughts would be appreciated:

———————————
Last October, when we were out for our weekly coffee date, I told you that I physically crave and desire you, and that I wanted to talk about this more. You agreed and said that you would talk with me about this. The following week, you even acknowledged my ask, but that you weren’t feeling great, but would do so. I was really encouraged that you remembered and acknowledged it. Then we never spoke about it again. Last month, I asked if you would read “Come Together” and discuss it with me. You agreed, but again, I don’t think it’s something you’ve done yet.

After several months of waiting for you to bring it up, I am confused and hurt, and there’s a pain when I think about it. I miss physical intimacy in our marriage, and there’s a part of me that just feels empty.

I want us to be able to work together to find a way to lower the stakes for both of us for talking about sex and physical intimacy. Right now it feels like a joint address to congress to even ask to talk about it, and I don’t think that’s good for either of us. I also think just getting some of this out in the open would lift some of the heaviness and tension that exists in our marriage. 

We’ve made and are making a lot of progress on our emotional connection and intimacy, and I value the closeness of these past few months more than you can know. But, it’s really hard not having the experience and practice with talking about sex. Because I want to share what I’m thinking with you. I love you so much, and not being able to share this with you makes the emptiness worse.",3,1738983309.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

I've been dealing with what I think is bloat on and off for awhile now and I just feel miserable. When I breathe in I can feel air move around in me on my right side near my lower ribs. I don't drink, I don't smoke, I'm relatively healthy and exercise pretty regularly doing cardio and strength training. I do have mild scoliosis.

  
I'm on 50 mg of zoloft that I take daily. I don't do drugs and I don't eat any fast food.

  
It's really exhausting. I can't figure out if it's meat, dairy, too much of either, not enough of something, not enough exercise....idk... I can just tell I'm not getting good full breaths because I do yoga and I'm pretty in tune with that, so I can tell something is up. Anyone else dealt with this? Every now and then I take a deep breath and it very satisfyingly forces me to burp, and the bloating isn't constant. There are periods where I feel amazing and very strong and fit, then others where I feel lethargic and fatigued. 

  
I'm usually drinking about a half gallon of water a day, even though I know I need more, sometimes it's hard to meet the gallon a day. I drink 8 oz of coffee a day specifically although sometime I have decaf on top of that. ",1,1738982599.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

\
I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ikcrb1,https://i.redd.it/6l8n3qjltthe1.jpeg,Need title / link please. TIA,"Two years ago, April 21, was the day lost our first child. While I lay in the cold, sterile operating room, undergoing a D&C procedure, my ‘on–a–business–trip‘ husband was celebrating another woman’s birthday.

The irony was almost suffocating.

My hands trembled as I scrolled further through her posts. Since that day, she had been flaunting all kinds of luxury items, each one identical to things I owned, except for one.

A jasmine–scented perfume.

Then I saw her most recent post, pinned at the top. It was an ultrasound image. She was pregnant.

I dropped my phone, my heart pounding, and frantically searched through the dirty laundry basket. I found the shirt Daniel had worn the night before. Lifting it to my nose, the unmistakable scent of jasmine hit me.

I never wear perfume.

When I didn’t respond to the message, the person on the other end. grew impatient. My phone buzzed again and again as photos and videos came flooding in. Clutching my belly, I sank onto the couch, struggling to breathe.

I forced myself to look at the undeniable evidence of Daniel’s betrayal. The woman in the photos was young and beautiful, her ponytail. bouncing with life. There were pictures of her and Daniel.

He was rowing on a lake, playing in the snow, and tucking a maple leaf into her hair. It was as though each season, spring, summer, fall, and winter, was captured in their little love story.

Taking a deep breath, I shakily opened one of the videos. In it, Daniel stood by the ocean, tenderly calling her ‘My Carina.‘

She softly asked, “Do you love me?”

This was my husband of seven years, the father of the baby growing inside me, replying with a warmth I hadn’t seen in years.

‘I’ll always love you, Cara.’

I replayed the video over and over, tears streaming down my face. As dusk fell, the room around me grew dim.

Daniel finally came home. His voice was gentle as he lightly scolded me, “Olivia, why didn’t you turn on the lights? It’s so dark! What if you fall?”

He flipped the light switch, and the room lit up. I quickly covered my tear–streaked face as he knelt in front of me and took my hand.

“Why are you crying? Who made my precious wife and our little one so sad?” he asked, his voice soft as he kissed my belly.

As he leaned closer, I smelled the same sweet jasmine fragrance. Struggling to keep calm, I asked, “Where were you?”

“I was working late at the office. What’s wrong, honey?” Daniel replied casually, as though nothing was out of the ordinary..

‘You’re lying, Daniel. You were with Cara! She had a craving for those famous dumplings from the east side of the city, and since there was no delivery, you drove over an hour from the west side to get them for her. She even live–streamed the whole thing!‘

Feigning nonchalance, I smiled, gently squeezing his hand. “Honey, I suddenly have a craving for those dumplings from the east side, too,” I said, resting my hands on my belly.

As if sensing my pain, the baby kicked hard. “Can you get some for me?”

Annoyance flickered across Daniel’s face as he pulled his hand away, frustration creeping into his expression. “Those dumplings aren’t anything special. Besides, you’re pretty far along. You should watch what you eat.” Standing up, he added, “For the sake of our son, just bear with it a little longer, okay?”

Without waiting for a response, he muttered, “I’m going to take a shower. I’m exhausted. Why don’t you call Mom and ask her to make you something?”

The bathroom door clicked shut.

Swallowing my sobs, I gently stroked my belly and whispered, “Oh, sweetheart, you and I are about to fight a tough battle together.”

Chapter 2

Daniel’s phone blinked on the dining table. As usual, he never even tried to hide his infidelity in front of me.

Did he really think I was that naïve?

The sound of water running in the bathroom echoed through the house. With a sigh, I struggled with my pregnant belly and slowly stood up. Hoping for a quick solution, I tried all the obvious. passwords from our wedding anniversary and our birthdays, but none of them worked. My hands trembled as I entered the date from Cara’s ultrasound report.

Success!

Biting my lip in frustration, I sneered as I opened the messaging app’s storage. Sure enough, Cara’s profile picture was there. Their avatars matched.

He said, “If love lasts forever,” and she replied, “Does it matter if we’re together every day?”

I clicked into the chat and was greeted by a flood of “Darling, I miss you” and “Baby, when will I see you again?” Determined not to let my emotions take over, I activated the screen recording feature.

Next, I opened Daniel’s shopping app. To my dismay, his order history was filled with pregnancy supplements, skincare products, and makeup. They were all sent to the same address. Every delivery was made to Cara.

With one hand resting on my restless baby, I took screenshots with the other. I sent the videos and screenshots to myself, then carefully deleted the evidence. Satisfied that everything was in order, I placed the phone back exactly where I’d found it.

Waddling back to the bedroom, I lay down on my side. The weight of betrayal settled over me as my heart felt like it had a hole ripped. through it, and I couldn’t stop shivering from the cold weight of betrayal. After seven years of marriage, I had been reduced to a cruel joke.

When Daniel came out of the shower, his phone rang. From my vantage point, through the crack in the door, I saw his face soften as he answered the call. Glancing toward the bedroom, he carefully stepped out onto the balcony, closing the door behind him.

Curiosity gnawing at me, I forced myself up and stood by the door, watching him. I couldn’t make out the words, but his expression was tender, with a slight smile. At some point, whoever was on the other end must have said something that made him frown in discomfort. But soon enough, he caved, agreeing with a subtle smile.

The chill in my chest deepened. Slowly, I turned and dragged myself back to bed, feeling as if the air had been sucked out of the room. Even breathing felt like a burden.

A few minutes later, I heard Daniel tiptoe back inside. One of his. hands rested on my belly while the other gently brushed the hair from my forehead.

His voice was soft as he whispered, “Baby, there’s an urgent project at work. I need to go in.”

I turned my head and stared deeply into his eyes. My last shred of hope flickered weakly as I asked, “I don’t feel well. Could you stay?”

For a brief moment, I thought that if he chose to stay with me instead of running to her, I could try to forgive him.

But then I remembered: Once the kite string snaps, it can never be fixed.

As expected, Daniel gave me a troubled smile, trying to reassure me. “Sweetheart, this project is essential for the company. Lean’t miss it.” “I’ll call Mom to come over and stay with you, okay?”

A wave of nausea washed over me, goosebumps prickling my skin. Still, I managed to force out the words, “Drive safely.”

I lay there in silence, watching him get dressed and leave. Slowly, I got up, holding my belly, and made my way downstairs to hail a taxi. “Maplewood Estates,” I told the driver.

He sped through the streets, and just as we arrived, I saw Daniel’s car pull in. My stomach clenched as I asked the driver to park behind a tree. From the back seat, I watched as Cara fluttered into Daniel’s arms like a butterfly.

He caught her gently, placing a hand on her flat stomach. His face softened with a look of tender reproach, and he playfully tapped her nose.

Cradling my belly with one hand, I took out my phone and switched to video mode. With trembling fingers, I watched through the screen as Daniel lifted Cara into the passenger seat and carefully buckled her seatbelt.

My eyes burned, but I blinked back the tears.

“Driver, follow that car,” I said.

The car climbed onto the overpass, neon lights flashing by outside the window. In a daze, my nails dug into the window frame until they split, the sharp pain snapping me back to reality. I put my bleeding fingers into my mouth and bit down hard.

As the car wove through the city streets, I repeated to myself repeatedly, “Olivia, endure it. The pain will pass.”

When we arrived at Riverside General Hospital, I scanned the QR code to pay the driver.

As I stepped out of the car, the usually quiet driver turned to me and said, with unexpected kindness, “Miss, take care of yourself. For the baby’s sake, don’t hurt yourself.”

Since discovering Daniel’s affair, I hadn’t told a soul. The secret felt like poison, slowly eating away at me from the inside. The kindness of a stranger felt like a fresh breath of air, pulling me back from the abyss.

I gently closed the car door, offering him a small smile. “Don’t worry, Sir. No–one can hurt me anymore. Because I’m ready to throw the trash where it belongs.”

Chapter 3

I hid behind a pillar, watching Daniel. He had been too busy with work to attend a single prenatal check–up with me during my entire pregnancy. Yet here he was, running around the hospital, registering, picking up medication, and gently helping another woman in and out like the perfect husband.

At that moment, I realized it wasn’t that he was too busy. He didn’t want to make an effort for the wife he’d been married to for seven years.

In the bustling hospital lobby, Daniel held the woman close, reminding her, “The doctor said you should eat less tonight and try to stay active. In the early stages of pregnancy, digestion can be tricky, so let’s follow the advice this time, okay?”

“Aww, fine, I got it!” she replied, pouting playfully. But it’s your fault! You bought way too many dumplings.”

“Alright, alright, I’ll take the blame,” he said with a smile. “It’s my fault. for making my sweetheart eat too much, okay?”

“That’s better.” She smirked. “Fine, I’ll forgive you… this time.”

As I watched them, they bantered like a real couple, close and inseparable, while I stood under the hospital’s harsh fluorescent lights, feeling like an intruder in my own life. I was invisible to them. With a heavy heart, I held my belly and slowly shuffled out of the hospital. Outside, the scene was no less cruel. The rain had started. The cold autumn wind blew against me, and the rain felt like it was trying to drown the world in its chill. Through the mist, I watched as Daniel draped his coat over her, shielding her from the rain and gently helping her into the front passenger seat.

The woman smiled up at him, grabbing his tie and pulling him in for a kiss. My husband cupped her face and kissed her deeply right there in the rain. When they finally pulled apart, he tapped her nose playfully, and she tugged on his tie again, biting his lip hard.

To my surprise, instead of getting upset, he just smiled like he was

thrilled. Then, he got into the car. As the car was about to pull away, the woman rolled down the window, locking eyes with me.

She gave me a smug, taunting look and said, “Olivia, you’ve lost.”

I smiled and shook my head. A strange calm washed over me. “It’s okay, Olivia.”

Then, I whispered to myself, “He’s just a man, nothing more.”

As the car turned the corner, I waved. “Daniel, I don’t want you anymore. You’re hers.”

In that decisive moment, standing under the hospital awning, I calmly sent all the evidence I had gathered to my mentor, a well–known divorce lawyer. I was going to secure the best future for my child, no matter what.

By the time I finished, the rain had already soaked the hem of my dress. Oddly enough, I barely noticed. Just as I put my phone away, it rang.

It was Mom.

“Olivia, I made some soup for you and brought it to the house. Where are you and Danny? Why aren’t you home?” Her voice was filled with warmth and concern.

Before I could respond, she continued, “Oh, that Danny. You’re this far along, and he’s still taking you out? You really need to be careful right now.”

Hearing my mom’s voice felt like a blow, like opening a floodgate I had been trying so hard to keep closed. All the pain I had been holding in grew into an overwhelming weight, pressing down on my chest. I bit down hard on my lip, fighting back the sob rising in my throat. The pain of suppressing it sent a shiver through my entire body.

“Mom, don’t worry,” I said, forcing a smile even though she couldn’t see me.

“We’re just out having dinner.” I swallowed hard, trying to keep my voice steady. “Oh, we’re being careful. Danny’s right here with me.”

I had to keep it together. I couldn’t let my mom hear me cry. I wouldn’t.

“It’s raining, Mom. Drive home safely, okay? Text me when you get there.”

I hung up quickly before my voice could betray me. Once the call ended, I took a deep breath and tried to hold everything in, but no matter how hard I tried, the tears finally spilled over. I cried quietly, my body trembling under the weight of it all.

There I stood, a heavily pregnant woman, belly aching, surrounded by strangers coming and going from the hospital. And in that cold, indifferent world, I cried until I had no more tears left in me.

Chapter 4

Daniel didn’t come home that night. Instead, he only sent a text:

‘Hey Olivia, I’m working late tonight and crashing into the office. It’s getting cold and rainy, so don’t forget to close the window before bed. Love you always, your husband.‘

I read the message without feeling anything. In the past, I would have worried, replied, or waited for Daniel. Now, I didn’t even bother to respond. I used to think I was the happiest woman in the world because I had the best husband. But reality hit me hard. It had all been a ridiculous facade. People’s hearts are hidden behind their ribs, and their lies are scribbled on paper.

A few days later, I received the divorce papers my lawyer had drafted. I printed them out, signed my name, and started packing up my things to move back to my mom’s place. Just as I was getting ready to leave, my phone rang with an unknown number.

It was Cara.

We met at a café downstairs. Cara arrived with an air of confidence, sitting across from me with a smug smile, a supermarket shopping bag by her side. Three months pregnant and balancing on thin high heels, she looked at me as if she had already won.

“I thought you wouldn’t come,” she said, a smug lilt in her voice. “After all, you never replied to my messages.”

I smiled calmly. My heart was steady, not a flicker of emotion breaking through. “Why wouldn’t I come? I haven’t done anything shameful that I need to hide.” I leaned back, still smiling. “Besides, Daniel and I are legally married, so I have nothing to hide. Unlike some people who, no matter how hard they try, will always be the hidden third.” “You-!” she snapped, but I cut her off again.

“Oh, and thank you, by the way,” I said, my voice steady. “For sending me all the evidence of your little affair with Daniel. Collecting all that would’ve been much harder on my own.”

I smiled, this time more dismissively. “So, this coffee’s on me.”

I placed some cash under my cup, stood up slowly, and rested my hand on my belly.

“What do you mean by that?” she asked through clenched teeth as she grabbed my arm.

“It means I don’t want him anymore, I replied, pulling my arm free. “If you want him, he’s all yours.”

Her eyes narrowed, and she threw my arm aside angrily. “What game are you playing now? Don’t think I’m buying this for a second!”

The force of her shove sent me stumbling backward, and I fell to the floor. At that moment, it felt like a knife had ripped through my belly. Pain shot through me, and I felt my body convulsed.

Blood poured from between my legs, and I screamed in terror, “Save my baby!”

I barely registered Cara fleeing in panic. Forcing myself to stay calm, I asked the café staff to call an ambulance. By the time they lifted me into the ambulance, my dress was drenched in blood.

As my consciousness began to slip away, I heard a nurse asking for my phone password. I unlocked it for her, and they called my emergency contact, my husband, six times.

At least, that’s what he told me. Regardless, a few months back I started making myself go out on friday nights to try and socialize. I’m not great at making friends so I mostly just hung out and sang karaoke. I met this nice guy but it didn’t go anywhere and I didn’t see him again until December. I ran into him again, had a really good conversation and ended up exchanging phone numbers. We got coffee and it was great. We were both super up front about what we wanted in life and luckily enough, it matched up really well. We chat over text, Christmas comes and goes and we go out again. He asks me to be his girlfriend and I accept. We talk about our hopes and dreams, our expectations from a partner and it’s all wonderful. 

Things continue wonderfully, we get along really well, our values align, we both really like the outdoors and the idea of homesteading. We spent new years together and everything was going so very well. He started changing his diet so that he wouldn’t have to worry about eating anything that might get me sick. He told me that he would give me the next 75 years and I told him that if we both lived that long I reserved the right to extend the timeline. He met my folks and I met some of his. 

I had about given up on finding my person when he came into my life. Then he showed up and I started to hope that I wouldn’t be alone. I never told him that the first time we met was right around the same time I caught the bouquet at my cousin’s wedding. I didn’t put much stock in the old wives tale but the longer we were together the more I started to wonder. 

Then he ran into his ex who offered to give him a chance to live his dream. She also expressed interest in getting back together with him. The next day he showed up at my house and told me that he was going to pursue his dream and that that meant that he was going to be spending a lot of time with her. I told him I didn’t like it (we are both firmly monogamous and this had been discussed before) but that I wasn’t going to break up with him over it because I trusted him. He told me to take a couple of days to think about it. I did and my resolve solidified, after all relationships take work and he was worth fighting for. I asked him if we could talk so that we could discuss where our heads were at he agreed and we met at a neutral location. Then he told me that this wasn’t fair to me and that he was breaking up with me. I tried to talk to him but he had made up his mind that he was doing the right thing. So I told him that if nothing I could say would change his mind then he may as well just go. So he did. 
Now it’s over. 
The plans we made, dust in the wind.
The promises we made taste like ash in my mouth.
Despite it all, I just want him to show up and tell me that it was a mistake to break up. To tell me that he still loves me and that he wants me and the life we were planning just as much as I do. To tell me that he wants to fight for us too. 

He won’t, so here I am, heartbroken, and wishing things were different while the rose from the first flowers he gave me forms roots and sprouts leaves as if to mock what I almost had and couldn’t keep.",5,1738981628.0,heartbreak,4,1.0,False

As promised, here are my photos of the 1995 Pork Chow Mein MRE that came in first place along with the Corned Beef Hash in my recent poll, as well as my personal remarks regarding my overall experience with it.

Lets start with the Bag, along with the contents:

https://preview.redd.it/bdfnttbuzshe1.jpg?width=4624&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=77492f205fc459d7ed0e13d9b49419e2a5f190c3

Here is the outer bag. Being 1995, I think this should be the last year the ""brown bags"" were still in use before being replaced by the lighter, tan, packaging.

This particular meal was packaged by Right Away Foods, of McAllen Texas.

https://preview.redd.it/qmxjv3360the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76d05bd5d31a80a4a8aaa7e8f4e127616c6904da

Here is the complete MRE as it came packaged. This includes:

1. The Main Entree, ""Pork Chow Mein"", which was actually produced by Shelf Stable Foods INC. of Cincinnati Ohio. Being born in Toledo Ohio myself, I am always absolutely floored to get stuff made in my home state.

https://preview.redd.it/njklj15p2the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a94c5981a4ba3fdbb65cbbeb3979627d11120ddc

https://preview.redd.it/viq34l8v2the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7c399723a18f90e62863849dc31f5ea03c442980

2. Noodles, Chow Mein. A special side item that is designed specifically to be paired with the Pork Chow Mein entree. This was packed by Right Away Foods of McAllen, as well.

https://preview.redd.it/0cjzdedy2the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6745569cd9d8b2b92e129154d1554ed590974b38

4. Crackers. Standard MRE Crackers of this generation, again packaged by McAllen.

https://preview.redd.it/n99bany13the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b22762da8ba50eb3c9d424f0b703287a74dc7b0

5. Fortified Peanut Butter. This is a smooth peanut butter which was packed by Thermo Pac of Stone Mountain Georgia. Packaged here to go with the crackers, and arguably to be paired with the Pork Chow Mein as a ""peanut sauce"".

https://preview.redd.it/vc2akjh63the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4c761efc0fabc4926d23d81b7582b0d57d2eb43a

6. Baverage Base Powder, Orange Flavor. Packaged by Trans-Packers Services Corp. of Brooklyn New York. This was designed to make 12 fluid ounces (330ml) of an orange isotonic beverage similar to gatorade.

https://preview.redd.it/6qo2tn6d3the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54b6c755c6b1b37cccb932d331fd2746aba34a24

7. M & M Candy. This is a 1995 dated bag as well. More astute observers will have noticed already from the overview picture that the bag has already changed since 1994 to a more modern design. It seems that somewhere around this time period the bag was updated. It seems to have been packaged in Hackettstown New Jersey by Mars. 

Unfortunately, due the photo limit per post, I've had to combine the ""contents"" picture for the M & M candy with the initial packaging photo. Notice here how the lighter brown M & M pieces have already gone the way of the dodo. The pack size has not changed, though.

8. An Oatmeal Cookie, Chocolate Covered. Packaged by McAllen of Texas again.

https://preview.redd.it/atifrnqo3the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=28cbd59c11b597f7bf8955629f0f01cb71a57c6b

9. An FRH, MRE Spoon (of the modern type), and Accessory Packet ""A"". Accessory Packet ""A"" containing: Tobasco brand hot sauce, Domino Brand Sugar (6 grams), toilet paper, matches, Tasters Choice Coffee in the standard red package of the time, generic mint chewing gum, a wet nap brand towelette, iodized salt, and a dry non dairy cream substitute for the coffee. The Tobasco was in decent shape, which is always a positive indication things haven't been stored too poorly. The tasters choice seemed a little ""caked""; but, not to a point where it was certainly bad, finally, the mint gum looked a little ""aged""; but, also not any worse than some much newer pieces I've seen. All in all, a healthy indicator of things to come.

The FRH is quite an old design, and its obvious there were some issues with these ones leaking their fillings. The inside of the bag is absolutely full of the filings which make up the filling of the MRE heater. Certainly, the newer ones are far more effective at containing their fuel mixtures. Due to how poorly these tend to age, I never try to heat old MREs with these heaters, especially ones I intend to consume entirely, thus I didn't even bother destroying this one to attempt a reaction.

A final note on the contents: I have mentioned that this is a 1995. What I have not yet talked about is just how late of a 1995 this is. I would guess this is probably one of the very last bags packed that year, as all of the components are quite late 1995 production. The crackers being made in early December of 1995! Quite interesting, especially considering that this would have been the last year of the brown bags, and the last of the 12 menu years!

The contents now having been fully examined, its time to actually examine them and consume them.

As always, I try to give these old MRE's a fair chance. This means I eat them fully heated (Boiled for 6 minutes to both warm them and kill any of the worst food borne illnessess to ensure my own safety), and I eat them on an empty stomach after a full day which includes 10km walking and running, as well as an hour of cardio and an additional  strenght training routine. These aren't quite field conditions; but, this does mean I burn on average 3000 calories a day and am active for a good portion of the day as a general rule. As such, my objective levels of hunger do approach that of many men in the field by the end of the day, and I'm usually hungry enough that I'll eat nearly anything with an open mind; but, I am not starving to the point that I will think anything edible tastes good.

After all, an MRE is not a snack for a man who has already had 3 square meals, cooked in his own kitchen, topped off with an entire box of oreos. It is not a 5 star meal. It isn't a flavorful meal. It is a meal specifically designed to include a balance of macros tailored to the needs of men who are active in the field. It is thus carb heavy and should not be unreasonably hard to digest, nor strongly seasoned.

Sadly, I see a-lot of people who speak about their experience with MRE's very negatively after eating them on a full stomach, and with visible cookie crumbs on their table or workbench. Without passing judgement on these individuals, this is simply not a fair perspective from which to judge a field ration. I myself remember when I was a reasonably round teenager and was given an MRE for the first time; I found it quite unenjoyable in comparison to a fast food hamburger and a fruit pie. Exceptionally unsurprising! Men in the field also want hamburgers and fried fruit pies! But, this is not possible, and it is often the case that a field kitchen is not even able to be brought up, thus the MRE is the solution to this problem.

As such, I frown upon this behavior without reservation. and I encourage anyone who has never had an MRE before to first try to give an MRE the right conditions to be consumed in before passing judgement on it!

Starting with the Main ""Meal"" along with the Mealtime Beverage:

https://preview.redd.it/08spkft88the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e321583c68d750d782bee05a1c8b057f7b181c92

This is how the Pork Chow Mein came out of the bag after heating. This is without the addition of any Tobasco or the Chow Mein Noodles. There are large visible pieces of pork, celery, and water chesnuts. There were apparently some mushrooms in here too; but, they were not very ""present"" in the flavor of the meal, nor in its general appearance. This meal did contain two ""chemical"" type additives in the form of Disodium Indsinate, and Disodium Guanylate. This combination is used specifically to enhance the umami flavor of the meal, in the same way MSG might be used in similar food products.

An initial taste test of this dish revealed it to be quite inoffensive in taste. Not very salty. Not very strongly flavored. I would contend that the flavors of the pork and the celery were some of the strongest ones present, along with the mild broth flavor of the sauce. The water chesnuts held up very well, and provided a very solid feeling of eating something ""chinese like"". I can imagine that men 30 years ago would have been very happy with this take on ""chinese food""; though, today this would not truly pass muster as a chinese dish.

Now Looking at the Chow Mein Noodles:

https://preview.redd.it/qkpbxn4v9the1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e736c3682e5003f0931c39ffceca32340f361b7f

These were completely as advertised. A deep fried ""noodle"" which had quite a few similarities with a fried potato stick. I believe that such fried noodles are still quite obtainable and found at many ""Asian"" buffets or in the super market as a topper used in the same way french fried onions and bacon crumbs are used. I seem to remember these also being popular at salad bars for a time in the 90s and very early 2000s? The first few bites of these revealed absolutely nothing ""off"" about the test of the noodles; though, some spoiling of the oils within them seems to have occurred, as a few of them had a gentle ""expired potato chips"" flavor to them that was on the cusp of rancidity; but, not quite spoiled enough to deserve the title. Entirely enjoyable; but, old!

Due to image limits, I can't post a photo of the noodles added to the Pork Chow Mein in this initial post; however, my opinion is that they actually did very little for the actual dish itself. Naturally, there was very little else to do with them; but, I found that even though they were unsalted, and had a very agreeable taste, they simply added no new ""dimension"" to the flavor of the Pork Chow Mein, and in some ways tamed its already very mild flavor. I think they had the greatest impact on the ""texture"" of the dish; though, I am not sure I would call this impact either positive or negative. It was simply ""there"". In any case, a very cool item that is between a side dish and a main course!

Now the Crackers and Peanut Butter:

https://preview.redd.it/p19cvx5hhthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9bb408147665d8d7aa301778b4237f42632a4335

Here are the crackers as they came out of the package. As usual, these are pretty bulletproof. These ones still have a perfect seal on the bag; despite this, they were a little on the ""stale"" end, in a similar way that the Chow Mein Noodles were. Nothing wrong with them at all, and they were perfectly edible; but, worth noting.

Now the Peanut Butter:

https://preview.redd.it/dwxar7fvhthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cafa6d407faf961617e673b3aa005d986c7835b0

Again, due to image restraints, a compromise has had to be made here. A small amount of the peanut butter has been pictured on the \*Suppenteller\* I have used to serve the Chow Mein in. This shot also shows the Chow Mein with the Tobasco added to it.

(A fun fact for people back home in the USA: Many Germans traditionally do not really eat out of ""Bowls""; but, large, saucer like plates which are rather shallow and quite wide. The Suppenteller is gently tilted at the rim in order to concentrate your meal into a corner to be picked up with your spoon as it becomes emptier. Many older people here find bowls as we know them to be rather uncouth to eat from, though they have become more popular for eating cereal and similar dishes).

In any case, back to the peanut butter: As we can see here, I've tried to eat the Chow Mein with some of the peanut butter in an attempt to try and improvise a ""peanut sauce"". I have done this not truly out of my own imagination; but, because I have heard from a number of old hands that this was quite popular to do with this menu. I will be the first to admit that I do not think I am not old enough to find that this flavor combination passes muster. The peanut butter provided is a very smooth, very processed, very sweet variety. All this means that, for better or worse, it is not suitable for being used as a peanut sauce substitute when considering our more evolved taste expectations when it comes to ""Asian Food"". It may very well be that this was an anticipated and accepted taste to guys who were in their 20s and 30s back in the 90s, and who had eaten earlier Americanizations of Asian food; however, its just too much for my taste expectations to accept, and I don't like it! Since I never ate chinese food as a little boy in the 90s, I don't know how normal it was to slap standard creamy peanut butter on the end of the buffet line and call it peanut sauce; but, that just wasn't good. Sorry old hands! I'm with the Whippersnappers on this one!

That being said, the peanut butter itself was divine. As with many products, I believe peanut butter tastes ever so different today than it did even 20 odd years ago. One of the great things about MREs is that they have allowed these older versions of such products to be well preserved in small quantities to be eaten decades later, allowing relatively fair taste comparisons. Overall, it was a bit smoother, bit sweeter, and less textured than modern creamy peanut butters. Its taste and texture was closest to the modern Skippy brand. I enjoyed the majority of this on my crackers, which is paired very fairly with.

The big question here is: Should this really be the ""side"" for this menu? The peanut butter is far to sweet to pair with the meal itself; but, crackers were the side item with pretty much every menu at this point, meaning it is indeed the ""side"" no matter how you slice it or would desire it. I do believe a version of this menu had freeze dried fruit too instead of the Candy, so you could have eaten that as your side instead, and had this as dessert. That probably was more reasonable; but, less easily done in the field. That all being said, I enjoyed these as an extended dessert item with the peanut butter later, and nobody stopped me!

Now checking out the Mealtime Beverage:

https://preview.redd.it/mc3h6fy6bthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5cd7593757621cf350135a50765954e97734f831

The powder itself before mixing. It had a very pale ""yellow"" color, as is typical of many of the earlier orange beverage bases. As you can see, its held up perfectly fine, nothing wrong with it at all, no caking, off color, weird smell, etc.

It made 330ml (12 fluid ounces) of orange beverage.

https://preview.redd.it/2ryvoonebthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=708a54fcb1fc20c217182db23a450dd8dbca8033

Here is a portion of the mixed beverage prepared as prescribed (my glass did not quite contain all of it, so some I left in measuring cup until I had consumed some). I have heard some people complain that these beverages have a distinct ""vitamin flavor"" to them, which I can certainly confirm is the case; though, I'm not entirely sure that the flavor is exceptionally intrusive.

I think it's very important for people, especially younger people who did not have the chance to form any memories to the contrary, to understand just how long ago 30 to 40 years ago really was in terms of food science. Atrificial and shelf stable flavors were very different than the absolutely fantastic flavors we enjoy today, this was true even into the 90s and early 2000s when I was a kid. It was simply far more difficult to make food and (especially) drinks which had been fortified with vitamins taste as though this were not the case. There is a reason why cereals for kids, which were and are still fortified, were and are simply loaded with sugars! I would even argue that this drink mix did a decent job of taking the ""edge"" off the fortified flavor compared to some other stuff that I remember of the same vintage. Anyone who remembers some of, the ""muscle shake"" powders from back in the 90s will certainly remember how much those tasted like you had crushed up a pile of chewable vitamin tablets and mixed them with thickened milk and aspartame.

On-top of this, another consideration is that these mixes had, and continue to have another, more humanitarian purpose, and that is covering up the taste of lukewarm, chemically purified, water. Anyone who has drank from a water trailer will know how awful this water objectively tastes, even if its not dangerous to drink. Thus, that annoying taste it has actually carries with it the benefit of covering up one even worse off taste with another, less upsetting one.

Thus, in summary, this drink mix is absolutely fine as it stands. I do believe it was supposed to compete with the flavor of orange gatorade or something similar. It doesn't come \*that\* close to this particular goal; but, is certainly very drinkable and gets flying colors at its goal of carrying sugar, macros, and vitamins into the body while covering up goofy water taste.

The broader question of how well it pairs with the meal itself is harder to answer. All in all, I think something else would have paired with this dish a tad better; but, the question of course is what else could have really been included at that point in time? Probably not much else while rounding out the nutrition goals of the menu. Thus, I can't knock it at all.

This now just leaves us to discuss the dessert items and the dessert beverage:

First the dessert items:

The M & M Candy:

Please see the above photograph, as image constraints mean I had to use the same photograph for the itemized description, and this portion of the review.

The M & M Candy was absolutely fine as always. Enjoyable, crunchy, chocolately. Probably not much more to say here. They tasted just like new ones do, and looked like them too. The light brown ones were already gone!

The M & M's seem to be the most commonly seen ""Candy"" of the three which were supposed to be included in the MRE's of this generation. There were either Charms, Heat Stable Chocolate Bars, or the M & M's. I think from the point of view of a ground pounder, I'd want the M & M's the most. I've never hat the heat stable chocolate; but, have heard its awful from a number of guys, and the Charms are difficult to eat due to the plastic wrapper and them being a sticky mess when warm, not to mention I've heard a number of old guys talk about how Charms were quite literally cursed, either certain colors, or the entire pack. As such, they refused to eat them, and sometimes felt even getting them in their bag was bad luck. Maybe this itself speaks to how rare it was to actually get them?

Thus, if it had to be one of those three, the M & M's are certainly not the most interesting; but, perhaps the most enjoyable!

The Chocolate Covered Oatmeal Cookie:

https://preview.redd.it/rkowzge3nthe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=99b1aae1d4e17d8125887bf8f39e92f040f296d1

This is a curious item. Many people, both old hands and modern commentators alike will swear up and down that these things are amazing.

I even can tell you that I have had one of these before that I found much more enjoyable than I did this one for some reason? The reason why is unclear to me at this point. I do remember the one I've already had came out of a Chicken and Rice (1989ish?) a few years ago. I seem to remember that one being amazing in every bite; but, this one, I'm not sure?

In any case, this one was newer, and was fresher. There was not a thing wrong with it, and it tasted very good; but, for whatever reason, I was simply not wowed by it like I was by the lemon pound cake a few weeks ago.

A fair dessert item to be sure, and I'm not going to rate it badly; but, I will be bold and say: ""This isn't quite as good as people keep giving it credit for, and I think thats part of why my expectations were so high it couldn't possibly meet them"".

I could more scientifically say that I believe the modern MRE cookies are not very good, due to them being far too hard, and doing the same thing that captain crunch does to the inside of your mouth as a result if not eaten carefully; but, I would still take one over this due to them being a bit more flavorful and larger. I hope thats a fair judgement that at least someone here will stand by.

We close with the Dessert Beverage, the humble MRE Coffee:

https://preview.redd.it/z8k9ukklothe1.jpg?width=3468&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=03f226d0b44d9884393612a2d34a1944de9d163e

When I ate the Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce from 1994, I piled my coffee and cocoa together. This is very normal behavior. But, since there was no cocoa this time, it was fair game to drink as prescribed, and nothing could be done for that.

What is to be said about it? Its an absolutely \*acceptable\* coffee. Some guys love to rave about how good the MRE coffee is; but, honestly, its very average, and everyone knows it. Its not too strong, not too bitter, not too anything. I'd be happy to have it instead of no coffee!

This time around, the tasters choice had not held up quite as well as the last pouch, and took a little more work to get dissolved into the hot water. I decided to only add the creamer and leave the sugar out so I could taste it better. Overall, just a tad on the watery side this time around; but, I think that had a-lot to do with age.

Overall, perfectly fine to drink while eating the crackers and peanut butter, the M and M's, and the chocolate covered cookie. Whether or not it would have been better to have a sugar free drink mix and sugar free sweetener to free up some sugar to be given as a cocoa beverage base is up to you. I think that would have been the tastier, if not less nutritionally balanced, and thus unacceptable, choice, though!

The Gum:

Final note regarding the gum - absolutely acceptable; but, far inferior in comparison to the brand name Chicklets thats were in the 1994 package. Lost it's flavor within minutes and was of a clearly inferior quality. Cheaper for the government? Without a doubt. 

Final Conclusions:

This menu was perfectly fine in every way. Everything aged exceptionally well. Not quite as well as the 1994 Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce meal did due to the noodles going a little stale, the crackers being just a \*tad\* old tasting, and the tasters choice being a bit down on its luck; but, overall it was nearly as well preserved, and I consumed every bit of all the items inside it with no ill effects. Not quite as much of a ""raw carb infusion"" feeling of power came from it as the Spaghetti meal gave me; but, I suppose you should expect that.

The ""enjoyability"" of this menu was hard to really pin down. I think it wasn't bad at all. It can even be said to have tasted very good; but, it didn't ""wow"" me anywhere or give me quite the hit of dopamine that the Spaghetti and Meat Sauce meal did.

Why that is? I'm not sure. I think this menu tried very very hard, and went a long way. Its certainly one of the most exciting meals they had in the MRE lineup of the era, if not \*the\* wildcard of them all; but, it does this at the expense of a-lot of ""synergy"" between the components that were provided for by food science at the time, and thus, somehow loses some ground against the more traditional menus by way of the same items through which it beats them in other ways. The main and noodles are solid; but, there just wasn't much around that paired well with this to make the meal feel ""right"" at the time.

As a result, all in all, I must admit that I understand why this menu eventually was cut in all its forms by the end of 2000. I went into this expecting this menu to completely blow me out of the water, expecting it to make Spaghetti with Meat and Sauce look like something that a 3rd world military force ate; alas, the truth of the matter is that this menu was perfectly fine; but, its just not ""exciting"" nor ""comforting"", and thus can't compete with many of the simpler, yet more beloved menus. In this regard, I believe that Pork Chow Mein might even be similar to the Pizza slice menus. A-lot of promise - a good result - but the expectations simply were so high as to not be possible to meet.

Thats all for this week, guys!

See you next Friday. I'm pretty sure I'll be doing the Corned Beef Hash; but, I'm getting mighty tempted to tear open one of those early 2000s menus and experience one of the meals of the new millennium!

The bouillon powder has me the most stumped. I've come across some folks who claim bouillon has an infinite shelf life, but I say hogwash.

**CHAPTER I**

***La Herradura, El Salvador***

**3-16-99**

A year ago, Javier’s parents started calling his eventual move to the U.S. a ""trip"" and sent him movies and a VHS player for his birthday. He dreams of joining them in California, imagining life with a pool and fruit trees. While surrounded by friends whose parents are already in the U.S. or soon leaving, Javier is the only one at school without both parents. He and his friends fantasize about American life: pizza, McDonald's, and snow.

His parents call regularly, sending pictures, and he feels close despite the distance. Overhearing his grandparents, he learns his trip is near, likely by Mother’s Day. When his aunt, Tía Mali, confirms the date, Javier’s excitement grows, though he's still unsure about the details. He imagines walking across the Golden Gate Bridge and promises never to forget Tía Mali.

**3-17-99**

Javier's parents plan to use Don Dago, a coyote who visits their town yearly, to reach the U.S. Their small, flood-prone town sees Javier and Mali making paper boats during winter floods. Don Dago, known for smuggling people north, sits at Doña Argentina’s cantina, where locals line up for his help. His strict rates are non-negotiable, recorded in a notepad. Javier’s mom used his services, and many others do too. At seven, Javier was denied a U.S. visa for being too young. Don Dago later assured his grandparents he’d take him when ready. Holding onto hope, Javier writes a made-up number atop school assignments to symbolize their savings goal.

**3-20-99**

Javier lies in Mali's bed as she gets ready for a dance and worrying about meeting ""The Dentist."" He reflects on his mom crossing into the U.S., recalling her promise to return. Mali shares how quickly his mom's journey was, and they discuss its dangers. Javier remembers failing to get a U.S. visa with a fake identity as ""Roberto Jr."" Despite his efforts, he never made it. He recalls the disappointment and support from Abuelita and Mali. Mali describes his mom vanishing into the night and seeing snow for the first time. As Mali waits for her ride, they count stars through the skylight and sharing stories.

**3-23-99**

Javier recalls talks with La Chele Gloria, the loud but trusted fruit vendor, about his journey and family history. Despite her gossip and rough speech, she provides comfort and jokes that he shouldn't forget her in the U.S. She tells how Javier’s father secretly left during a war, telling only his own father. As a child, Javier had wandered off after him and caused panic. He was later found by a ceiba tree, waiting for a bus, and scolded by his mother. La Chele Gloria urges Javier to wake up and be ready. Now almost ten, he knows it’s not ""if"" but ""when"" he'll travel with Don Dago.

**3-31-99**

Javier attends “Escuela Parroquial Fray Cosme Spessotto” and is walked to school by his quiet but attentive Grandpa, who ensures he looks neat. At home, Grandpa dresses casually and burns trash, with Javier helping collect coconut casings. Though sober since Javier’s mom left, Javier fears his old habits may return. At school, the strict nuns enforce rules. Javier once got detention for having a ""girlfriend"". He recalls representing his department in a grammar competition, shaking the president’s hand but not placing at the top. Though disappointed, Mali reassures him. His parents, proud of his achievements, send money for treats, but he still strives to impress them. His mom once pushed him academically, using a blackboard for lessons. Javier dreams of excelling in the U.S., proving himself, and avoiding teasing. Mali reminds him the family is already proud.

**4-1-99**

On Jueves Santo, Grandpa and Javier walk through the hot, humid town, passing “Romans” in red skirts and cardboard sandals searching for Jesus. At school, Mother Superior grants Javier permission to miss a week after Grandpa explains his mother sent money for a Guatemala trip. She advises him to catch up on assignments. Back home, they find Don Dago on the porch, asking about Javier’s teeth. Inside, Grandpa, Abuelita, and Don Dago discuss passports, with Don Dago reminding Grandpa not to forget it and promising to call two days before. Outside, Javier hears their talk as the Romans pass by, rattling their matracas.

**4-4-99**

Three days pass with no call from Don Dago. Mali explains coyotes take time to prepare. Javier worries about missing school and the nuns’ reactions. On Viernes Santo, Mali takes him to San Salvador with her ex-boyfriend’s family, visiting Los Planes de Rendero and La Puerta del Diablo. He notices how Don Pablito and Doña Luisita show more affection than his grandparents.

As anxiety grows, The Baker’s son finally announces Don Dago is on the phone. Javier rushes, dropping mangoes, as everyone gathers. Don Dago confirms the trip in two days. Grandpa calls Javier’s parents, who reassure him. Looking at their photos, Javier feels closer to them.

On his last day at school, no one knows Javier is leaving. He tells friends he’ll be gone a week and secretly prepares. He gives away his favorite toys, saying his parents wanted him to do something nice. After school, he says goodbye and heads home.

That evening, Javier and Mali reflect on his departure. She asks if he’ll miss his friends, and they look through photo albums, including pictures of his father. Excited yet sad, Javier quietly counts stars with Mali, both feeling the weight of the separation.

**4-6-99**

Javier wakes early as Mali kisses him awake. He showers, dresses in dark clothes per Don Dago’s instructions, and packs a black backpack. Grandpa waits by the door, also packed. Abuelita and Mali help with final preparations, hugging and kissing him goodbye with tears in their eyes. They make the sign of the cross over him. As they leave, Grandpa warns him not to look back, but Javier steals a glance, seeing his family huddled in the doorway before walking away.

**CHAPTER II**

***Tecún Umán, Guatemala***

**4-6-99**

Javier and Grandpa arrive early at the bus terminal and wait for Don Dago, who eventually arrives with six others: two women, a girl, and three men. They board the bus to Guatemala, sitting separately as instructed. As they travel, Javier observes the passengers, including a stern man named Marcelo and a friendly boy, Alejandro. At the border, Grandpa bribes an official to stamp their passports. While waiting, Javier meets Alejandro, a Mexican boy returning home. They continue the journey through Guatemala, passing mountains, lakes, and coffee fields. After a long day, they reach Tecún Umán at night, where a bicitaxi takes them to Don Carlos’s store, their lodging for the night. Don Dago gathers the group, assigns sleeping arrangements, and introduces everyone. Grandpa makes a heartfelt request for the group to look after Javier once he leaves. As the others head to a motel, Javier and Grandpa settle in at Don Carlos’s store, preparing for the next step of their journey.

**4-12-99**

In Tecún Umán, Javier and Grandpa settle into a routine. Grandpa sticks to his grooming habits, while Javier adjusts to using a toilet with his support. They eat meals at Don Carlos’s store, with food brought by Don Dago. Marcelo and Chele keep to themselves, while Patricia, Carla, and Chino stay together. The group’s stay extends beyond two days due to delays, frustrating some, though Don Dago insists it's for their safety. Grandpa privately discusses plans with him and teaches Javier their travel route and fake Mexican identities. At night, they explore town, seeing Marcelo and Chele smoking and Los Soyas laughing. Rumors spread about Marta and Don Dago. Javier reflects on identity after hearing Grandpa use ""indio"" with disdain. He learns more about Grandpa’s past as a soldier and policeman than ever before. Evenings end with TV before lights-out, with Grandpa promising calls home, though they've only called once.

**4-19-99**

Marcelo snaps, yelling at Don Dago and throwing a tortilla over the delays. Don Dago insists things are fine, but frustration grows. Marcelo refuses to pay the rest of his fee, and Javier learns the journey is paid in installments. Grandpa reassures him their payment is covered but worries about their permits expiring. To distract Javier, Grandpa tells stories. Later, Jesús takes him to the arcade. Grandpa gives him money and safety rules. Jesús impresses Javier with his confidence and skills. On the way back, Jesús points to Mexico across the river, saying he’ll cross soon. That evening, Grandpa learns Javier leaves the next day. They celebrate with Pollo Campero, then call his parents and Abuelita. His parents are excited, but Abuelita and Mali are emotional. On the walk back, Grandpa comforts him, and Javier realizes how much he’ll miss him.

**4-20-99**

Javier and the group prepare to leave, backpacks ready. Don Dago collects the motel keys and tells them to wait. Grandpa checks Javier’s things, giving him extra supplies. Bicitaxis arrive, and Jesús fist-bumps Javier before they reach the small bus. Everyone boards, but Javier lingers. Grandpa, holding back tears, blesses him, tells him to trust Marcelo, and reminds him a cadejo will protect him. Javier hugs Grandpa, says he loves him, then boards. As the bus pulls away, he watches Grandpa wave until he disappears. Holding back tears, he stares out the window at the banana trees, searching for the red eyes of his cadejo.

1ikcj6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1ikcj6c/cutting_down_on_caffeine_after_psychiatry/,Cutting Down on Caffeine After Psychiatry Appointment," Hi. I started university this year. I used to drink coffee HEAVILY. I'd drink it at mornings, at the campus, when I come back home, after dinner and before sleeping. It was an addiction of mine. Since I was diagnosed to have ADHD around 2020-2021, and my meds ran out since I changed cities, I decided to schedule an appointment with one of the psychiatrists here. I told him everything I could think of and turns out that on top of ADHD I also have very light OCD and god damn derealization which I wasn't surprised to hear because I've been suffering from it since I was give or take 7. The psychiatrist explicitly told me to either drink decaf coffee or don't go above once or twice a day.

 Now, I was scared at first. I am generally very tired even after waking up from a 17-hour sleep and I thought coffee was all that's keeping me awake. Turns out it isn't. For the first day or two of reducing myself to only one cup of coffee, I'd usually get itching feelings to just go brew myself a new one but it disappeared over time. I also cut down heavily on carbonated drinks safe for mineral water. I feel AWESOME right now.

 Am I still tired? Yes. Am I tired because I'm not having caffeine just slam jammed into my veins at every given second? No. Coffee is so god damn addicting and binding that once you start using it you fear that if you let go of it you'll be ""a shell of your former self"" and ""snooze all the time"" when it's generally the opposite.

 I also want this wall of text to be a call for act to everyone reading it. Get up from your computer, prepare a small backpack and go out for a walk for at least an hour. Let the fresh air just enter your lungs freely, completely safe from the panic of being late to anything you might have planned. Just walk wherever you want. You want a natural ""wake up"" hormone? That's what you'll get from that walk. You'll feel more and more alive each day you take a walk. Let your body wake you up, not some ground beans or god knows what.

TL;DR: Man yaps heavily about himself going to the doctor, getting diagnosed, cutting down heavily on coffee and carbonated drinks and tells you to go get a walk",3,1738981058.0,decaf,1,0.81,False
1ikcich,https://www.reddit.com/r/PittsburghSocialClub/comments/1ikcich/friend_application/,Friend Application,"I (39M) moved here close to a year ago. In my first year I took in the city and kinda just scouted out the vibe. 

Looking to develop my social circle and find all types of relationships. Just a coffee friend, a cry too friend, or a go with me to this thing friend.

I’m a Seahawks fan but love live sporting events in general (live or otherwise). I went to 11 pirates game last year just to experience the ambiance.

Comedy, Music, and World of Warcraft are my main interests, but love getting lost in a museum or deep conversation. I’m fairly die hard left politically and can’t stop punning. 

Looking for anything from casual hangs (all genders/ages/races) to lasting bonds.

I’ve never wrote one of these before and accept all roasts if this is cringe.
