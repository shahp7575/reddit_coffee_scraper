1jrrgz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1jrrgz6/zep_unintended_ketosis/,Zep + Unintended Ketosis,"I am finishing 2nd week of 2.5mg Zep and I have been smelling awful fruity ammonia smell since the first week. I did not realize this could be from ketosis until I started investigating why I am smelling such an awful smell and have spent hours cleaning every day but can't find the source. Many subs have talked about phantom ghost smells and I thought maybe that was the reason. So I spent mega-$$$$ to mask the smell with diffusers, candles, etc. After more investigation online and in subs, I read about other on Zep having hyper-sensitive smell and some mentioning ketosis breath. I then ordered ketone test trips and it turns out that I'm in ketosis. The smell is coming from me! I really despise the fruity acetone smell I seem to be emitting (skin, breath, urine). NOTE: I am not intentionally eating low carb, high protein or high fat. I'm simply not hungry at all. When I force myself to eat, I take two bites and I feel like it's stuck in my throat and feel super full. Calorie intake is very low despite trying to eat small things throughout the day without hunger. I even tried eating pizza to try and break into the ketosis. When I force carbs to make sure I'm not in a danger zone of ketosis, I still maintain ketosis. 3rd injection is scheduled for tomorrow. Anyone else experience the same? Anyone know how to eliminate the smell of full body ketones? I'm on day 14. I've lost 15lbs. I'm guessing the ketosis is responsible for the rapid loss, and I see my menopausal belly shrinking by the day - all good. BUT THE SMELL!!!  I would love to fix this. I currently have a coffee-scented balm on my nose to help, but it's not helping much. TIA ",1,1743814258.0,Zepbound,1,1.0,False

1jrrex9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jrrex9,Is it ok if I lock my cat up at night?,"Hey everyone,

We rescued our cat over a month ago and we have been loving him but he wakes me up 5:30 every morning to eat, I normally let him meow until 6 and then feed him once my alarm goes off. He has started within the last few days waking me up even earlier, some times at 3 am, 4:30, and 5.
He doesn‚Äôt even bother my boyfriend, probably because I feed him but if neither of us get up to him meowing, he crawls over me and purrs in my face which is sweet but not at 4:30 am, especially when I went to bed at midnight. 

He does this to eat and we are currently switching his litter over which I think is part of the problem ( clay to pellets bc it‚Äôs cheaper and less chemicals) but I am losing my patience and am so run down. My boyfriend will feed him too but he just doesn‚Äôt crawl all over him or meow in his face, only mine. 

I‚Äôm loving the bond I have w him so far but I am just wondering if it would be awful of me to make him sleep in the (very large) bathroom his litter box is in? There are built in shelves he will lay in and I of course will bring his food and water but I am honestly suffering.

I‚Äôm hoping once we can afford an automatic kibble dispenser that will help the issue, but I‚Äôm honestly not sure because he loves the routine of waking me up, wet food and dry given to him, we play and I make coffee lol. 

Also- if I go BACK to bed after feeding him he also meows non stop because he wants me to play. This is one of the reasons I think that the automatic food dispenser will cut it for his morning routine. 

Should I change the routine we currently have set, if so, how?

Okay, so this might sound like something straight out of a rom-com (or a Netflix short film), but it genuinely happened and I‚Äôm still a little dazed about it.

Let‚Äôs rewind to July 2024. I was at Phoenix Mall, casually hanging out at Starbucks, just enjoying my coffee and scrolling through my phone. This guy walks up and politely asks if someone‚Äôs sitting opposite me. I said no, and that was it. He sat down, opened his laptop, and started working. I barely glanced at him until I noticed‚Äîokay, he‚Äôs very recognisable. One of those people who just‚Ä¶ stand out. Tall, sharply dressed, confident vibe, that kind of face you don‚Äôt forget. No conversation beyond that, but the interaction stuck in my head for some reason.

Fast forward a few weeks‚ÄîI was at another caf√©, totally different area, random Saturday evening. Guess who I see again? Same guy. Same quiet solo vibe, laptop open, working. He didn‚Äôt notice me this time (I think?), but I was weirdly shaken. I mean, Chennai is big. What are the odds? I brushed it off as coincidence.

Cut to Thursday this week, I went to lunch at Dou in Alwarpet (side note: their food selection is underrated‚Äîso many unique Italian dishes beyond the usual pizza-pasta stuff, must try if you‚Äôre into that and oh! The pastries!!!!). And then‚Äîbam. There he is again. This time in a classy beige linen shirt and pants, looking like he walked out of a Pinterest board. Alone, working. 

At this point, I was half laughing to myself in disbelief. Three times?! Three different places, three different months, and all completely unplanned. It genuinely felt like the universe was playing some softcore ‚ÄúBefore Sunrise‚Äù type script on me.

And the worst part? I wanted to talk to him this time. Like badly. But I didn‚Äôt. I chickened out. Again. Now I‚Äôm sitting here wondering what kind of plotline I just lived through and if it‚Äôs already over before it even started.

Anyway, thanks for reading my accidental meet-cute-that-wasn‚Äôt. If any of you are reading this and believe in signs or fate or whatever‚Ä¶ tell me I‚Äôm not crazy?

Also if anyone knows a classy, solo-lunching beige-linen-wearing guy who hangs out at caf√©s with his laptop, tell him some random girl noticed him. Thrice. And regrets not saying hi.

It might be long and somewhat disjointed at times. I‚Äôd be very happy if you could read through it and respond.

There was a girl in our university class‚ÄîI'll refer to her as ""K"" from now on. I fell in love with K almost from the very first moment I saw her. As we ended up in the same class and our friend groups began to overlap, I got to know her better and my feelings for her only grew stronger. Every time I saw her or spoke with her, my emotions deepened.

However, I could never take the step to start a more private conversation with her. I‚Äôm a bit shy by nature, and to be honest, I was scared that if I confessed my feelings, it would ruin the entire friendship circle I had at university. At one point, a friend of mine‚ÄîI'll call him ""M""‚Äînoticed that I was getting too close to K. Another mutual friend, ""A"", who had been friends with M since high school, was also flirting with K at the time. M told me it wouldn‚Äôt be appropriate for me to show interest in her as well. But nothing serious ever developed between A and K.

All of this happened during the first year of university. My friendship with K continued, but as I said, it never evolved into anything more. A big reason was my uncertainty about whether she felt anything similar toward me. She always treated me kindly and smiled often. In our final year of university, we started talking more while on campus. I used to try to sit next to her in our shared classes, and I often succeeded. Once, she had a few daisies in her hand and gave me one. That moment was one of the happiest in my life. When I got home, I placed that flower between the pages of my favorite book and kept it there for a long time.

Some time after that, I found out K had started dating another guy from our class. This was toward the end of the first semester of our final year. Shortly after the new semester began, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and that may have been the last time I ever saw her in person. Because of the pandemic and the fact that university was over, our relationship weakened even further.

From time to time, I would respond to her Instagram stories or send birthday wishes, but our conversations never really went anywhere. During all this time, I couldn't develop feelings for anyone else. My naturally reserved personality, combined with working in male-dominated environments as a computer engineer, didn‚Äôt help either.

From what I can tell on Instagram, it seems K began a new relationship sometime around late 2023 or early 2024. Around the same time, I had also started looking for a new job. I even interviewed with company X, where K works. The interviews went really well, and I was almost at the offer stage. During this process, I messaged K to ask her about her experience at the company and how satisfied she was working there. She replied the next day, but I could sense that she wasn‚Äôt very eager to keep the conversation going, so I didn‚Äôt push it. Eventually, company X couldn't proceed with an offer due to hiring constraints, and that was the end of it. A month later, I started working at company Y.

In February 2025, our company resumed in-office days, so now I go in twice a week. At the beginning of March, during one of these office days, I suddenly had a craving for tea, even though I'm not much of a tea drinker. I went to the company cafeteria, got my tea, paid, and as I turned around, I saw K again. I was shocked. My heart started pounding. It felt like one of those cheesy movie scenes I used to laugh at‚Äîexcept now I was living it. I immediately hugged her and felt like I was reconnecting after ages.

In that moment, I glanced at her fingers to see if there was any sign of her relationship and didn‚Äôt see a ring, which gave me a little hope. We started chatting briefly. She told me that she had just started working at this new company and that it was her first week. I suggested we grab a coffee together later in the day so we could talk more, and we did.

During our coffee chat, she said she was surprised by my reaction and found it funny. She even said, ‚ÄúI wish someone had filmed it so we could rewatch it later.‚Äù We laughed, but since we both had meetings, we couldn‚Äôt talk for very long.

Close to the end of the workday, I stopped by her desk and saw a bouquet of roses there. She was smelling them. Most likely, they were from her current partner. They still follow each other on Instagram as well.

Since that day, I‚Äôve been trying to match one of my in-office days with hers and invite her for a coffee break each time. Thankfully, she says yes, and at least now I get to see her again. This is both incredibly fulfilling and deeply heartbreaking for me. Just when I thought I was finally starting to forget her, all my feelings came flooding back.

1jrr67p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1jrr67p/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke. It was our song remastered",1,1743813331.0,Tik_tok_stories,0,1.0,False

This is gonna be a bit of a long one, but please bear with me. And I want to preface this by saying I‚Äôve only known this girl for a month. 

I met this girl at a club. I had 0 intention of going that night, but everything just so happened to go down perfectly that evening to allow me time to go. As soon as I got there and got my drinks, she was all over me. It was awkward at first, but I played along.

I asked her the typical bs you ask someone you‚Äôve just met. After that, we moved to the dance floor. This is where it happened. After a few minutes, she turned around and put her arms around my neck and we just kept staring into each other‚Äôs eyes. Then, she pulled me into a kiss. Even more awkward. But after I pulled away, she looked me in the eyes and giggled. 

That giggle. In that moment it felt like something shifted. Like the universe had leaned in to listen with me. It wove its way through the spaces of my ribs and settled in a hole I didn‚Äôt know was there. It was the most beautiful sound I had ever heard in my life.

I noticed everything about this woman in that moment. Etched every detail into the fabric of my mind. The way her smile didn‚Äôt curl at the edges. The little wrinkles in the corners of her eyes. The way their green color was still so vibrant through their squints‚Äô. The streaks of grey that highlighted the sea of brown curls that made up her hair. How it was so messy, but the mess made her all the more beautiful. I couldn‚Äôt forget that moment if I tried.

I also want to say I have severe ADHD, so my mind is ALWAYS moving 1000mph. It always has for as long as I can remember. For the first time in my memorable life, it all stopped. The overthinking, all of the overwhelming thoughts, were just gone. I was there, in that moment, and only there. I‚Äôve been in a few relationships before, but never has ANYONE brought that kind of peace to my mind. Even when I‚Äôm trying to sleep my mind is filled to the brim. The days/nights here and there I‚Äôve spent at her place were just the same. My mind was calm. Nothing but her and what we were doing. I‚Äôve not been able to fall asleep so peacefully for as long as I can remember. 

I want to learn everything about this woman. Everything I‚Äôve learned so far, good and bad, just makes her seem all the better. She has literally changed the way I‚Äôve looked at life. I find work enjoyable. I‚Äôve kicked habits I‚Äôve had for years. It‚Äôs literally insane to me. No matter how much I try to wrap my head around it I‚Äôm left even more confused. I‚Äôve never been so absolutely certain about anyone in my life. 

Another first is that I don‚Äôt lust after this woman at all. At no point has getting in her pants been in the forefront of my mind. I was to show her love in the innocent ways. The pull of a blanket over her feet. Buying her favorite flowers when she feels like the world has forgotten about her. Making sure her coffee has the absolute perfect amount of sugar. 

I want to get lost in her eyes on an early Saturday morning. I want to show her how gentle life can be. I want to show her that she deserves to be cared for unconditionally and without question. I NEED her to know she is so much more than her body and that she deserves every ounce of someone. Something about her just feels so right. 

I could say so many more things, but I‚Äôve already made this long enough. If you‚Äôve read all of this, thank you. I just had to put this out there and get it off my chest. ",3,1743813093.0,love,1,1.0,False

I don‚Äôt really know how to word this I guess. It‚Äôs one of those days when you realise how bad this shit can get? Like, oh wow. My disability is disabling me. I feel almost in a way that I‚Äôm being dramatic? And that maybe I‚Äôm not as sick as I think I am? I can barley get out of bed to do basic things, or walk around my own house before needing to sit down. I‚Äôve cut down so much caffeine and energy drinks, I barley drink a coffee a day, Yet I still think I‚Äôm not trying hard enough to get better. 

I was speaking to my mom about it, and she says that she‚Äôs glad I‚Äôve been doing better but it‚Äôs just ‚Äúsomething I need to push through‚Äù. And went on about how I can‚Äôt lean on her for support forever as if it‚Äôs something I‚Äôm doing as an excuse for free loading. She proceeded to say ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt wanna live on disability for the rest of your life‚Äù and that eventually I‚Äôll need to work and move on, as if this is an optional disease I chose to have. 
I told her I struggle to shower and all she said was that ‚Äúyou need to do it.‚Äù 

1st of all, there‚Äôs no shame in needing disability. If I have to live like this forever, I will not be able to work a full time job. That‚Äôs that. why would I live in shame and be embarrassed about having this disease? 

2nd, I‚Äôve been ‚Äúpushing through‚Äù this since I got it, I didn‚Äôt know I was chronically ill. I only got worse. Because, spoiler alert, you can‚Äôt push through an illness. 

3, she made me feel dirty for not being able to shower everyday. I feel like I‚Äôm some dirty person who‚Äôs lazy and using POTS as an excuse to not bath and work. I wash my hair daily and do bird baths because hot showers make me pass out. 

Why do I have to act like I‚Äôm not disabled? Why do I have to pretend I‚Äôm fine, because it‚Äôs embarrassing apparently? 

I‚Äôve lost my entire personality to this illness, my childhood, college opportunities, working opportunities. I make $45 a week with the small job I do have, and have barley anything saved up. I‚Äôll never be someone who‚Äôs rich, that‚Äôs obvious, but why do I have to choose between being sick and on disability, but being happy with what I do have, vs being sick and working more, making myself worse just so I have money I won‚Äôt be able to do anything with. 

I‚Äôm sorry if this makes no sense. I just kinda got mad and needed to word it out of my head. It‚Äôs just one of the sad days I feel like I‚Äôm gaslighting myself. I hope you‚Äôre all having an alright day :( ",3,1743812894.0,POTS,0,1.0,False

On weekends I was less stringent about it but would often try to at least get a 12 hours fast in. 

Initially I saw really good and steady weight loss from this, but over the last year I found myself gaining weight in places I never used to before, but figured eh, I'm 35, my body is just changing. But having started to get more serious about my gym habits again this past December, I've been frustrated to see borderline no progress. It all seemed weird and off.

We'll, thank you SO much to whoever posted that Stacy Sims podcast, because I now know I should absolutely not be intermittent fasting, especially at my age! A few issues I've been having now make so much more sense.

This week I stopped intermittent fasting, and instead have made sure to have my protein coffee at 8am everyday, hahaha. My caloric intake has not increased, it's just distributed very differently. 

But I am wondering what to expect after two years of IF. Should I expect short term weight gain because my body isn't used to getting food this frequently? 

I'm just curious if anyone else has gone from longterm IF back to a normal rhythm diet, and what changes they experienced in the short and long terms.",2,1743812596.0,PetiteFitness,1,1.0,False

I bought a new car in July last year. I'm now at 15,000km. No lemon law here. 

On day 3 the app said I had two DTC codes, but no CEL on the car so I took it into the dealership who said there was nothing. The codes are still in the app and tells me constantly there are health issues.

The washer nozzles spray super low and worse at highway speed. The dealership confirmed they are aware of the complaints, they can't adjust them, and they expect a recall - that was last October and nothing yet. It was damn near dangerous this winter when salty road spray is coating the windshield in a white haze.

HVAC won't turn off with the windows open. When it's set to OFF it still behaves like it's set to AUTO. I fiddle with the temp before turning it off but it still constantly blows the fan at a high speed, like 70%. I have all the passive HVAC settings turned off to be sure. 

Occasionally the second row vents blow hot when I have AC selected. This isn't just the system cooling down. They'll be blowing HOT even after 15 or 30 min of driving and the front vents blowing ice cold. this happens sporadically so I'm wondering if it's a damper control issue or something.

The exterior door handle has a touch pad to lock the doors which stops working at random.

Auto start using the app will sometimes say it failed but I go out and the car is running.

When towing I constantly, like ever 5 min, get a ""take a coffee break"" warning. I absolutely never get this warning when not towing. And to top it off, I did a quick loop around my lakes private road with a trailer but the wiring not plugged in, never got the warning.

Driver side dash speaker is starting to crackle sporadically.

Top of the rear passenger door is rusting from under the weather stripping. 

OTA updates were advertised as standard in Canada but they don't work. Neither do manual USB updates from the Hyundai Canada website. I see the US has received 8-10 updates in the past year - some are added infotainment function and some are software fixes. So I'm wondering if there is an update out there that would solve any of my issues. 


The dealer has been good to work with, but nothing has been resolved.

I found this little oreo goofball sitting next to my front door. He went to take off, but instead of running away he hid under my bench. (Only two feet away) I almost reflexively picked him up, and not knowing what else to do took him  inside. He had a nasty wound on his front leg. Exposed muscle, but not actively bleeding.  I gave him some food, while I found an urgent care vet nearby. I was able to get him fixed up that day.  He's mostly healthy, intact , no chip.  I took him home to recover and figure out what to do with him, but by the time he healed up I got attached and couldn't think of giving him up. 

I named him Lucky.  I was in the vets office  talking to the GF telling her about tge whole thing, remarking i haven't even figured out what to call him. She said I should call him a lucky s.o.b. I  decided to shorten that a bit.

So far he's adjusting well. He's a talker. Probably the most vocal cat I've met. He's kinda clingy at times, not the least bit spicy.  I think he might have had a home before.  I remember seeing a similar looking cat frequenting my porch when I first bought my house a few years ago. There are more piebalds in the area, so I say for  sure if it was him.

(24F, first relationship, 37M very experienced)","I‚Äôm feeling really conflicted and would appreciate some outside perspective.

I‚Äôm 24F, and this is my first real relationship (though nothing is official yet). He‚Äôs 37M, has had six relationships‚Äîincluding a few long-term ones‚Äîso there‚Äôs a big gap in experience between us.

In the beginning, before anything physical even happened, he did ask me thoughtful questions‚Äîabout kids, dreams, hobbies, and even about our age difference. He wanted to make sure I was comfortable with it. That made me feel safe and cared for, like maybe this was someone I could grow something meaningful with.

Since then, though, that deeper conversation seems to have faded. We don‚Äôt really talk about much beyond logistics, flirting, or surface-level stuff. He doesn‚Äôt ask many questions about me anymore, and our senses of humor don‚Äôt really match (his is more sexual/raunchy, mine is light and playful). When I try to steer our conversations toward something more emotional or mentally stimulating, it often gets turned back toward sexual flirting‚Äîwhich gives me anxiety.

He‚Äôs been kind and respectful during the physical side of things‚Äîgentle, communicative, and affectionate. We cuddled, kissed, and even shared coffee the next morning. One time, he woke up with me at 5:30am to make me coffee before I left for work (his job doesn‚Äôt start until 8am), which was a really sweet gesture. I do feel cared for in those ways.

But still, I don‚Äôt feel emotionally close. We‚Äôve had sex twice‚Äîneither of us finished‚Äîand while he was considerate, I didn‚Äôt feel desire. Honestly, I‚Äôve never really felt sexual attraction for anyone, so I‚Äôm starting to wonder if I‚Äôm on the asexual spectrum. I crave romantic closeness and softness, but I don‚Äôt want sex the way he seems to. He‚Äôs mentioned that twice-a-week sex is important to him in a relationship, and I don‚Äôt know if I can meet that‚Äîespecially when I don‚Äôt feel emotionally connected yet.

We mostly meet at his place, and a lot of our texting involves sexual innuendo (mostly from his side). I try to match the tone, but it makes me anxious. I‚Äôd much rather slow down, spend time in neutral spaces, and develop a real emotional connection‚Äîbut I‚Äôm not sure how to say that without seeming like I‚Äôm backing out or changing the ‚Äúdeal.‚Äù

So I‚Äôm left wondering:
	‚Ä¢	Am I being paranoid or overthinking because this is all new to me?
	‚Ä¢	Or is there a deeper emotional mismatch, even though he‚Äôs a good, respectful person?
	‚Ä¢	Is there a way to steer this back toward emotional connection‚Äîor is it already off-track?
	‚Ä¢	And if I am on the asexual spectrum, how do I even begin to explain that to someone with a lot more experience?

If anyone‚Äôs been through something similar or has advice‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs about compatibility, boundaries, or just how to have this conversation‚ÄîI‚Äôd really appreciate it. Are there things I should be doing differently? Questions I should be asking myself or him?

Hi all I am wanting to reconnect with an old evangelical friend. For some past history he was evangelical and we had a bromance in late high school (which ends at 16 in the UK). He invited me to his church, which I accepted. I came from a non-praticing Christian background. I never truly bought what was said. However we split in sixth form as we different views and I was ""in a phase"" for lack of a better way to put it (nothing to do with religion). 

I also had differing views. He didn't just double down on religion once he left high school, he quadrupled down, and I never truly bought what the church said. We split in sixth form (which would be last 2 years of high school for North Americans). 

I am currently back from Uni on Easter break. I messaged him if we want to reconnect. We got along a lot during high school. He was 1 of only 2 friends who I ever confided in about my childhood trauma, and he was the first one too. I miss him. Plus, I am no longer in a phase anymore, and it seems he might be able to hold a conversation without mentioning god (I worry I am very very naive with that). Last time we spoke (late spring last year) he was trying to bring me back to his church. We agreed to go for a coffee a few days ago.

I also related to him as he has a non-british background. His family is from South America. As for me having an American mom, being born in the US, living there till age 9, I don't really relate to British culture and Brits. So that's why I connected to him so much. Infact my main reason for going to his church was the American diaspora.

Any advice would be welcomed.

tl;dr I am reconnecting with an old evangelical friend who I had a close friendship with from ages 15-16 and we split apart around 17 due to differing outlooks on life. I briefly joined his church, but didn't really buy what was said. We agreed to go for a coffee to reconnect, and we are now 19. Since 16 he has gotten much more religious.",1,1743811941.0,Exvangelical,0,1.0,False

Ever feel like you're juggling a thousand things and still running out of time? ‚è≥ What if I told you there‚Äôs a *simple* way to reclaim 5 extra hours a week... by just stacking a few habits for **10 minutes a day**? Yup, you read that right. Minimal effort, *maximum* return!

Let‚Äôs dive into this 10-minute habit-stacking routine that's been a total game-changer for me‚Äîand might just be for you too. Ready to give this a shot?

**1. Morning Mindfulness (2 minutes):**  
Start your day with a quick pause. *I mean it.* Just sit quietly, breathe, and set an intention for the day. It's like a mini-pep talk with yourself, setting a positive tone for whatever comes your way.

**2. Quick Workout (3 minutes):**  
Yes, 3 minutes *does* count when it's intentional! Think bodyweight exercises‚Äî10 squats, 10 push-ups, and 10 jumps. Boom, you‚Äôre energized and ready to go!

**3. Hydration Hit (1 minute):**  
Before you dive into that glorious coffee, chug a glass of water. üíß It‚Äôs amazing how a little hydration can boost your mood and clarity. (Pro tip: Pretend you‚Äôre on a desert island and this is the first sip in days. Makes it more fun!)

**4. Gratitude Glimpse (2 minutes):**  
Write down two things you‚Äôre grateful for. Even if it‚Äôs just the fact your socks match today. Seriously, a gratitude practice can *transform* your mindset.

**5. Quick Plan (2 minutes):**  
Take a couple of minutes to jot down your top priority for the day. It‚Äôs like giving yourself a roadmap, so you don‚Äôt end up scrolling through TikTok for 4 hours. *Who knows, you might even get more done by lunchtime!*

**Why These Habits?** ü§î  
Simple: they're quick, stackable, and collectively powerful. Each one tackles a different part of your well-being‚Äîmental clarity, physical energy, emotional balance‚Äîand when you stick with them, the impact compounds.

It sounds deceptively easy, right? That's the whole point. It‚Äôs not about drastic changes but subtle shifts that lead to big wins. After all, isn‚Äôt life already complicated enough?

So, who's up for the challenge? Who knows‚Äîmaybe these tiny practices will not only *save* you time but give you more energy to invest where it truly counts. I‚Äôd love to hear if any of you have tried this before or have other mini-habits that pack a punch! üåü

I am a 29 year old female. 5‚Äô1‚Äù and 120 lbs. I am diagnosed with mental health issues- Bipolar 2 (treated and well managed), anxiety, PTSD. POTS, dysmenorrhea (and heavy bleeding), chronic headaches, pelvic floor dysfunction with urinary incontinence (which resolved overall with pelvic floor therapy) , IBS-C, and fibromyalgia. I also have a stage 4 rectal prolapse that I‚Äôm working with a general surgeon to get repaired. I have another appt the end of the month. Just had a colonoscopy which came back fine.  I had a positive ANA in 2018. All further tests they did related to that were fine back then. At that point they ruled out many things with all my symptoms I was having and pin pointed it to POTS and fibromyalgia. The POTS is well managed, I consume lots of salt and water. Electrolytes and adequate food. I am active on my feet with my job. I only get a little short of breath and occasionally dizzy if I‚Äôve had too much coffee. Very very rarely the racing heart. The fibromyalgia has been well managed for years as I‚Äôve learned my triggers. If I get enough sleep I‚Äôm usually fine. My sleep has been unchanged. I have been sober from all substances (used to drink and smoke weed) for over a year and half. 
I take ‚ÄîLexapro 10 mg daily, Abilify 2mg daily, Lamictal 100 mg twice a day, topamax 50 mg at bedtime, hydroxyzine 50 mg at bedtime, melatonin 6 mg at bedtime, Vitamin D 5000 units every OTHER day, omega 3-6-9 daily, L- theanine for anxiety in the morning, one capful of miralax daily and 2 tablets of senna-docusate twice a day, magnesium 400 mg at bedtime, multivitamin and Celebrex 200 mg twice a day as needed during menstruation.

So the past 6 weeks or more. Ive had extreme fatigue, pain, pelvic/vaginal pain/pressure, cramping. Spotting throughout cycle which used to only happen when I tried birth control once so I stopped the birth control. I did have a laparoscopy done in 2017 to check for endometriosis and none was found at that time. My last cycle showed up 5 days early and I‚Äôm normally very regular. I‚Äôve had a swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck for over 6 weeks (it has gotten smaller in this time). I‚Äôve been having increased joint pain and increased acne. I eat a low meat, low sugar and dairy free diet due to lactose intolerance and IBS symptoms with meat. I also don‚Äôt eat peanuts or eggs due to IBS issues. 

The past 6 weeks, The fatigue and pain is worse than any fibromyalgia flare I‚Äôve ever had. They did a work up of labs for me recently including mono and respiratory panel and all was fine. Vitamin D, TSH, iron/ferritin, CPK and magnesium were normal. CBC and CMP were good except for these below. They aren‚Äôt concerned about the lymph node until 3 months of swelling. They did order a pelvic vaginal ultrasound for the pelvic pains but can‚Äôt get in for that until mid May. I asked them if they think anything could be autoimmune or if I could have developed an autoimmune issue but they think not the issue. I wished they‚Äôd check the labs just to make sure. Maybe I‚Äôm the positive ANA with no cause, but I haven‚Äôt had the ANA checked since 2018.

I will attach images of the ‚Äúabnormal‚Äù appearing labs and just wondering why I have possibly had elevated monocyte percentage for years?

The total blood protein was slightly elevated too.

Any insight or thoughts? I‚Äôm struggling! They suggested I talk to my psychiatrist about switching to Cymbalta instead of Lexapro for the pain management aspect of the medication. I have a psych appt on the 10th


Thank you all!

1jrqlxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/interviews/comments/1jrqlxk/interview_tips_that_helped_me_stand_out_among/,Interview tips that helped me stand out among candidates (verified by recruiters),"Since I started searching for internships in college and even after working full-time for a while, I‚Äôve gone through nearly hundreds of interviews. I summarized some of the tricks I used during interviews and applied them consistently in the end. One of my recruiters even said that my performance and communication style impressed him, which proved that these methods were super useful. Here are my tricks that helped me improve my prep quality:

**Start with small talk:**¬†It helps me relax and get into the right mindset and it leaves HR with a friendly impression. I usually start by asking where they are and how the weather is, and what I‚Äôve been up to recently.

**Use the Q&A session to sell myself again:**¬†I usually say something like: ""I know this is a very competitive position. I‚Äôd love to know what qualities you value most in a candidate."" Based on the HR‚Äôs answer, I will summarize and highlight my strengths again to reinforce my impression. I also proactively ask about the next steps to express my strong interest in the role.

**Research HR in advance**: Before interviews, I usually search for the HR‚Äôs profile on LinkedIn to prepare targeted questions for the Q&A session and show my interest. If I notice they‚Äôve been with the company for a long time, I‚Äôll casually mention it: ""I noticed you‚Äôve been with the company for quite a while, which shows great commitment. Could you share what you like most about working here?""

**Make your experience audience-friendly**: Most HR don't have tech background, so it‚Äôs important to explain my work in a way they can understand. I generally write out my example and let ChatGPT rephrase it to be friendly for non-technical audiences.

**Connect with alumni from the company as soon as you get the interview:**¬†This is the most efficient way to quickly learn about the company. When connecting with alumni, don‚Äôt immediately jump into asking for a coffee chat, ask them about the interview process and what they like most about working at the company.

**Show your understanding of the company during the interview**:Let the HR or hiring manager know that you‚Äôve done your homework for this interview. Prepare an example in advance that strongly connects the company‚Äôs culture, outlook, or business with your personality or experience.

**Prepare a work sample related to the company:**¬†It‚Äôs a good chance to showcase your execution skills and capabilities. Make the HR or hiring manager feel valued and respected.

**Maximize free resources**: Generate answers tailored to my resumes, questions, and specific roles: ChatGPT; Question prediction based on job roles and real question banks: AMA Interview; Practice for coding interviews and system design: Educative; Data techniques, the latest reports, and supplemental learning: DataCamp",1,1743811610.0,interviews,0,1.0,False
1jrqltx,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianTeenagers/comments/1jrqltx/got_harassed_and_i_dont_know_how_to_feel_about_it/,Got harassed (?) and I don‚Äôt know how to feel about it,"So on Eid, my cousin and I decided to go for a girls day out. We spent some nice time having pizza, cold coffee, even met up with a friend, and at the end of the day we ended up at the mall. Just before leaving, we thought we‚Äôd indulge in a dessert and then call it a day. 

We went to a dessert counter which was located close to the entry/exit gate and placed our order. Just then a small group of boys (probably our age) entered. They lingered close by and just kept staring and laughing amongst themselves for the whole time we were there‚Äîwhich, okay cool, at least they were keeping their distance. 

After finishing the dessert, we decided to leave but two of the boys started following us as we were walking towards the main exit. Then we heard one of them say ‚Äúhello, hello‚Äù  but we just ignored him and hoped that that would be enough of a hint. But alas, he kept trying to talk to us and we kept ignoring him. 

They were walking very close to us, almost right beside us. At that, my cousin glanced sideways at them so he took that chance and said, ‚Äúaap se kuch kehna tha.‚Äù He said this very giddily like when you‚Äôre nervous and that makes you laugh? Somewhat like that. 

We, though, _really_ didn‚Äôt want to hear it and I thought maybe we should be a little more direct. So I turned back to him, snapped that he need not say anything, grabbed my cousin‚Äôs arm and we tried to hurry out of there as fast as we could. We were almost running to where I had parked my scooty and they _still_ kept following us.

When we got there, I noticed something concerning‚Äîmy scooty was blocked on one side by a car and on the other by other bikes and scooters. The boys had situated themselves around the only way out‚Äîwhich was straight backwards. Normally, I wouldn‚Äôt have any problem with this but the road was a little higher levelled than the parking space and I couldn‚Äôt get my scooty to back over that on a good day, let alone with five boys gathered around and my cousin depending on me to get us out. 

I tried to get it out for a good five minutes or so but it didn‚Äôt budge. I needed someone to pull it back at the same time to get it out. All this while, that one boy kept trying to talk again even when his friends told him to let it go, he even said, ‚ÄúArey yeh toh gussa ho rhi hai,‚Äù when I told him to move aside (like _excuse me?!_). 

At one point, he said, ‚Äúkahan ja rhi ho, Hume bhi bata do, hum bhi chalenge,‚Äù so I held up my helmet and asked him, ‚Äúside ho rhe ho ya yeh sir pe phek ke maru?‚Äù That got him to move enough so that my cousin could go around and help pull the scooty.

We got it out and, _again_,  just as we were leaving, he said, ‚ÄúID toh deti jao.‚Äù Like _what_ part of that whole interaction makes you think that we were in any way interested in giving out our contact info?

But we got home safely and nothing happened afterwards. It really shook me up though because nothing like this had ever happened to me before. And now I don‚Äôt really know what to think. Neither of us have told our parents; it‚Äôs a pretty common occurrence for my cousin where she lives and I‚Äôm supposed to be going away for college later this year.

‚ÄúHello (my name)
It's been almost 3 years since we saw each other or spoke. I hope your life is happy and you and  (girlfriend name)are doing well. I played the new dragons dogma 2 and shadow of the colossus recently and was thinking with a smile of the times we would play together or have coffee at Costa or walk in the park.

I do miss you every day but until now I have kept my promise to stay out of your life. 

If you want to continue to not have any relationship with me then you have that right as an individual.

I did want to reach out to find out what your wishes are as sometimes when people argue they don't know how to reach out and try to make it better or make peace as they think their bridges are burned and broken and that it's too late. It's never too late when it's family.

I wish you all the love and happiness in the the world.

I hope one day we can have coffee together and smile at each other.
Love mum.‚Äù



My reply was 


‚ÄúYou and the others are not my family
You abuse and neglect and serve your own self interests over the needs of your so called ‚Äúfamily‚Äù even now no apology has been offered from you

Despite you I have matured into a fine young man with morals and integrity who considers others

then I blocked her after my heart rate calmed down 
Also (i received no promise from her I told her I didn‚Äôt need her in my life then blocked her)

I‚Äôve been depressed for a while since 
It‚Äôs clear even after 3 years nothing I said sunk in she just said a whole lot of unimportant dribble that had no substance and minimised everything into a ‚Äúargument‚Äù and it‚Äôs rich she wants to say it‚Äôs never too late for family yet can‚Äôt even give an apology 

I‚Äôm finding myself  being so tired of toxic people but they are like the hydra from Hercules I cut off one two more pop into my life‚Ä¶ I just cut out my step sister and borderline wanting to cut out my step dad and his wife and my girlfriends family has a toxic sister and mother I‚Äôm so tired having to deal with these emotionally self centred unkind creatures of people‚Ä¶ the none toxic people I seem to find all are outside ‚Äúfamily‚Äù

***Tuesday***

It took Gerry a few minutes to settle completely, and then she excused herself to freshen up. I guess she knew her way around hotel rooms better than I did, for she had no trouble going straight to the shut door adjacent to the glass wall (that one led out onto a balcony) and opening it to reveal the bathroom within.

As soon as she shut the door behind her, I huffed out a deep breath and fell back against the mattress, staring up at the ceiling. How in the world was this my life now? I rolled my head to the right, taking in Quent, who stood beside the glass wall and watched me.

‚ÄúYou okay, Sam?‚Äù he asked.

I drew myself back up onto my elbows. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. I think so? Maybe.‚Äù

He smirked at that. ‚ÄúHow long before you settle on an answer?‚Äù

‚ÄúDo divine women have periods?‚Äù I asked, my motormouth blurting out the question that had been drifting in the back of my mind, no matter how hard I tried to kill it with mental napalm.

Quent reared back, his face twisted in horror. *‚ÄúThat‚Äôs*¬†what you‚Äôre thinking about right now?‚Äù

It took him a second to start laughing, but Rubin was already cackling like a loon in my ear. *‚ÄúNow,*¬†I‚Äôm glad he‚Äôs here,‚Äù my invisible keeper laughed.

My cheeks reddened in embarrassment, and I buried my face behind a raised arm, waving the subject away with the other. ‚ÄúNever mind. Forget I said anything. Please.‚Äù What I wouldn‚Äôt give for the shifting ability to turn into something that would sink between the floorboards.

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù Quent said, pinching the bridge of his nose and groaning as if in pain. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to answer this precisely once, and then we‚Äôre *never*¬†speaking of it again, you get me?‚Äù

I nodded without looking at him, still cringing on behalf of both of us, especially when I heard him mutter, *‚ÄúFuck me,‚Äù*¬†under his breath.

I really should have asked my sisters.

‚ÄúMortals are not as flexible as the divine. They don‚Äôt heal as fast, nor do they adapt to environmental changes as fast. If I were to take you to Antenora, the snap freeze that occurs to mortals would take much longer to drag you under. Divine are, by design, thousands of times superior to mortals. We‚Äôre better physically *and*¬†mentally in every way. Do you really think something so natural as a divine‚Äôs need to procreate would be hampered by their inability to deal with the possibility of not being pregnant? In their case, they want it, they don‚Äôt get it, they move on to the next desire. There is no lag *between*¬†those situations any more than there‚Äôs a lag between when you cut yourself and when you‚Äôre not bleeding a second later.‚Äù

I was really grateful that he took the whole conversation away from the original topic and shoved it sideways into something that wasn‚Äôt so‚Ä¶excruciatingly awkward.

‚ÄúNow, remember our deal. Never again.‚Äù

I held up both hands and dipped my head in absolute surrender, agreeing wholeheartedly with him. *Stupid curiosity!*¬†Thankfully, by the time I got myself sorted, Gerry was coming out of the bathroom. ‚ÄúGood to go, Angel?‚Äù

She brushed her hands down herself and nodded. ‚ÄúAs ready as I‚Äôll ever be,‚Äù she said, crossing the room with her hands out to pull me to my feet. We may have clasped hands, but it would be a cold day in hell before I gave her any of my weight.

We walked out a minute later with my arm around her shoulders and hers around my waist. Quent led us to the bank of elevators, and a short while later, he knocked on Tucker‚Äôs door for us and stepped out of the way.

A man I didn‚Äôt recognise opened the door from the inside, though the wary look in his eyes as he seemed to recognise me meant he‚Äôd probably been amongst the casualties from Sunday morning. I pinched my lips together and tilted my head in a silent *‚ÄòHey, we didn‚Äôt start that‚Äô*¬†way, and he breathed through his discomfort. ‚ÄúMiss Portsmith. Mister Wilcott‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, stepping back to let us in.

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù I corrected. ‚ÄúThe last Wilcott to answer to ‚ÄòMister‚Äô was my grandpa, and he‚Äôs been gone a long time.‚Äù That wasn‚Äôt technically true, as the faculty at school referred to me as Mr Willcott, but I really wished they didn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúOf course, sir,‚Äù he said, which really wasn‚Äôt much better. His eyes then went to Quent, standing to one side of me, and narrowed suspiciously.

I wasn‚Äôt a fan. ‚ÄúOh, this here‚Äôs Quent: Kulon‚Äôs twin brother. You remember Kulon, right?‚Äù The way the guy paled confirmed my theory on our first meeting. Gerry discreetly pinched my side; not enough to hurt but enough to let me know I was being a dick, and she didn‚Äôt like it. I bit my tongue and waited for the man to get out of our way, because if she hadn‚Äôt liked that, she was really gonna hate what I‚Äôd planned on saying before she pinched me.

The man stepped back, announcing to the household that Miss Geraldine and I had arrived. I breathed through my annoyance at how he snubbed Quent, and Geraldine rubbed my side placatingly.

It then occurred to me how it had been hours since I‚Äôd had my last pill, so rather than risk something stupid, I plucked one out of my pocket and slipped it between my lips as we were led through the suite. In the next room, Tucker and Mister Santos sat on adjacent sofas with a drink in their hands.

‚ÄúAhhh, there you are. I was just telling Julian we would‚Äîwhat on earth happened to you?‚Äù he demanded, shooting to his feet and stepping towards us.

I only then remembered the state of my face. ‚ÄúOh ‚Ä¶ umm, you know ‚Ä¶ the usual. Doors and stuff,‚Äù I said, not entirely lying but going close enough to have a prickle of discomfort slither through me.

Instead of questioning me further, Tucker‚Äôs eyes softened and went to Geraldine. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve heard that before, yes,‚Äù he said remorsefully, and Gerry tucked her head against me. Given the bruises I knew about from her mother, it added more fuel to the fire of my hatred of that woman.

‚ÄúI was tussling with my roommates this afternoon, and I didn‚Äôt duck as fast as I should‚Äôve,‚Äù I clarified, and the icky feeling eased.

Satisfied with my second answer, Tucker moved around the coffee table and hugged his daughter first. Then he went to shake my hand, only to haul me into a manly hug.

It was weird, and I didn‚Äôt know how to take it. ‚ÄúUmmm,‚Äù I stammered awkwardly, which caused him to step back from me even though he still held me by one shoulder. I saw Tucker‚Äôs guard shoot a wary look at Quent, no doubt nervous about his reaction to the way Tucker seemed to be manhandling me.

Gerry had already moved on to embrace her godfather, but she was immediately back at my side at the first hint of my discomfort. ‚ÄúSo, what are we having for dinner, Daddy?‚Äù she asked, dragging the focus kicking and screaming from me.

‚ÄúJonas is doing a beef burgundy with broccolini soaked in garlic butter, freshly baked popovers and mashed potato. He‚Äôd planned on doing a baked cod with all the trimmings, but from memory, you don‚Äôt eat seafood, do you, Sam?‚Äù

I could practically feel Gerry‚Äôs eyes burning a hole in my neck as I cleared my throat and shook my head. ‚ÄúNo, sir. It‚Äôs a personal choice.‚Äù

Earlier in the week, Lucas showed me a DC comic from a few years ago involving the Atlantean king, who was asked why he ate fish and why he didn‚Äôt consider it cannibalism. His answer had been because he saw the fish life the way those of the land saw cows.

It was different for me, since my innate embodied their longevity and rebelled at the thought of cutting that life short by consuming it. Of course, I had plenty of other reasons that were far more humanly acceptable, but the end result was still the same. No seafood for me.

‚ÄúSo, I had an interesting discussion with Father Eames on Sunday night,‚Äù Mr Santos said, inserting himself into the conversation. ‚ÄúOnce he got over the shock of what you implied, he was fascinated by your views of godparents and the Christian religion in general.‚Äù

I rubbed the back of my neck uncomfortably, wanting very much to argue that I hadn‚Äôt implied anything. I‚Äôd made some very truthful statements that most of the human population wouldn‚Äôt understand. It wasn‚Äôt the same thing.

Fortunately for all of us, Gerry followed through on her promise back home. ‚ÄúNow, Mister Santos. We‚Äôve only just arrived, and we‚Äôre supposed to be sitting down for a friendly dinner this evening. It‚Äôs never a good thing to bring up either politics or religion when it‚Äôs a known fact that not everyone in attendance thinks the same way.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut that is where the best discussions come from, my dear,‚Äù Mr Santos argued, like the high-priced lawyer he was. ‚ÄúHow else do you achieve a meeting of the minds, if not when all the minds are engaged simultaneously?‚Äù His gaze came across to me. ‚ÄúWouldn‚Äôt you agree, Samuel?‚Äù

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù I corrected automatically. ‚ÄúOnly my parents call me Samuel, and that‚Äôs usually after I‚Äôve done something wrong.‚Äù

‚ÄúSam,‚Äù Mr Santos agreed. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm certain in your household‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúDaddy, did you know the Nascerdios family gave me back the family shares they bought?‚Äù Geraldine threw out, and as much as I appreciated her determination to keep the subject away from me, it killed me to know she‚Äôd thrown herself under the bus like that.

Both men turned to her, which had me instinctively tucking her behind my shoulder. Her hand remained wrapped around my back, and I could feel her face pressed to my shoulder.

‚ÄúThey *what?!‚Äù*¬†Mr Santos demanded, while Mr Portsmith merely watched me. ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt mean all of it, surely‚Ä¶‚Äù

My hand slid around her waist to rest on her far hip since her father still had a claim over her shoulders.

Mr Santos sat down heavily on the sofa behind him.

I'm down to share photos, too. 

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, ASE and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it. So, if you know any good emulators or anything for it, then let me know.

1jrqf5u,https://i.redd.it/qi3n9lxlpwse1.jpeg,My first Espresso machine,"Took me long enough, but was finally able to get myself a Rancilio Silvia V1 espresso machine to learn the craft with. After using pods for years and not getting that ‚Äòcr√®me‚Äô, I found this on Facebook marketplace.

It came with bunch of baskets, porta filters, jugs and a Rancilio grinder (although I‚Äôm not that chuffed with the grinder. Ideally I‚Äôd like to dial it in further and be a single hopper, any suggestions for around the ¬£200/¬£250 mark would be welcome, thinking of the DF54). 

Had a nightmare for the first few goes as I didn‚Äôt even realise the grind had to be as fine as it was meant to be.. and my grinder was already set the lowest it could go. After some help from my mate who‚Äôs a great barrista over WhatsApp, I realised the grinder was only doing drip filter coffee at best.

I took it all apart and gave it a good clean and removed the years of old coffee grinds baked into the spaces. I tried to align the number guide on the side to 0 when the burrs touched, but the way it attaches, it‚Äôs impossible to dial it in and seems to be off by 1 notch. Not sure if the only solution to that is to remove the numbers sticker and re-apply it in line.

I then did a full clean on the Silvia itself, took out the old gasket which had turned into a hardened piece of plastic and put all the bits into a bowl of Puly Caff. Never used that stuff before and now I‚Äôm never going to not use it!

After my fourth round of grinding beans I pulled a creamy 1:2 espresso (18g beans/36g liquid) in 27 seconds.

I was laid off from my full time job in January of 2024, and have been on the job hunt since. Over 1,000 job applications, networking, and many interviews later, I'm still stuck living with my parents a year later, unemployed. I decided to live at home after graduating because I couldn't find a job right away, and I wanted to save up once I was employed. Then I was laid off after only 10 months, and here I am. 

I was saving up to buy a car but never got to do so because of the layoff and I had other expenses that took priority. My student loans get higher every week because I can't afford to keeping paying them off. So I have zero independence during the week, and my closest friends live 300 miles away. The only job I can get is at a coffee shop. I feel stuck in my hometown, a bit embarrassed that I still live with my parents after 3 years, and I spend my days begging different companies to hire me. 

I don't want to come off ungrateful, because I know it can be so much worse, but I'm sad that my early twenties don't hold any good memories. I thought I'd be living in a big city, with a great group of friends, with a job I could tolerate. I worked hard in college with internships and networking. I was trying to set myself up for success just for everything to crash in on itself. I'm at a point with the job applications where I feel like since it's not working, I need to go and do something else. Teach English abroad? Go back to school?

But I'm bringing back this classic posting series. Gonna say this now so you don't have to: *Still goin' this asshole!*  Long yes, but most fans would be grateful that one of their yuppie subredditors took the time to put this together like I did!!!   



* Any episode that begins with Tony subjecting someone to intercourse is not going to set things up for a high-caliber entry in the series - which it is certainly not
* Check out that last shot of Carmela's face as Tony finally and mercifully rolls off of her - yikes!  I'll cut her some slack due to the trauma she went through, however.
* We're supposed to believe that Vito is reading a copy of ""Ab Attack"" for the health benefits and not for all the shirtless dudes?  
* This is the first episode where AJ finally transitions over into full-on estrogen mode.  Selling his drums instead of getting a job or not spending like a flipping idiot was such a dick move.  As was giving it to Tony and Carmela.
* Is it just me or is there something really off with the house fire scene?  My town has about 100,000 people (in other words, *""a good size city in Florida""*) and fires are very rare.  How many fires does this podunk town have, anyway?!  Then, that annoying woman runs out with her King Diamond makeup complaining about something or other and ordering Johnny Cakes around.  Then, they pan to show an old man in a dress or some sort of holocaust frock of some kind.  And it seems like the director told the extras standing around to just randomly point every 10 seconds for no reason. The guido looking stocky guy up front in the crowd at the fire. He reminds me of an actor (not a famous one, more of a character actor - I'm thinking 80's and 90's).  Anyone think he reminds you of someone? 
* It's clear the staff at Caputo's is heavily Mexican. Juliana Skiffle: *""Frankly, I'm not wild about the smell in there"".   (Meadow voice): That is SO racist!*
* When Burt and Patsy go into Buttfucks... whatever, the coffee place - notice the book on the display the Manager is arranging?  *(Meadow voice again).*  
* There seems to be a commentary on gentrification in this episode.  Showing the contrast between Newark, now peppered with Jamba Juice and Blockbuster references as well as 'say its supposed to be Starbucks without saying it's supposed to be Starbucks', and the little New Hampshire mom and pop town.   
* I have a theory that Thad McCone is a pedo but I'll cover that in a separate post
* Juliana is not my fave character.  But her introduction brings me to a thought related to Danielle infiltrating Adriana's life.  How easy would it be for the Feds to do the same but this time use a sexy woman to flirt with Tony.  Become his gumar.  (She'd have to be unmarried and be willing to...\[Chrissy voice\]: *I can't even SAY it!*).  I could see making a deal with a Heidi Fleiss type madame that got busted and she can go undercover to play Tony or go to prison.  She wouldn't be weirded out about sex and she could get a ton of info out of Tony while they're in bed (you'd be amazed how honest you can be when you're naked in the arms of someone pretending to love you).   She can be at all the dinners, report who's coming and going and when, overhear conversations, get the other gumars to spill what they know, etc.  
* When Amy Schumer comes to the counter at Blockbuster, she was very rude.  She completely interrupted AJ and the other guys' discussion on effective use of knife use.  Her insistence on being served could cost one of them their life and if ever confronted by Benicio Del Toro, they'd be cooked.
* Penis reference when Johnny Cakes daughter comes in and he mentions his 'glue gun'.  Disgusting.  
* Melfi starts her session scene with Elliott stating ""my father isn't an old man"".  The Melfi character is easily 50 in this episode.  Her father, then, likely 80 or so.   Not an old man?!  
* Notice George Clinton when the drums are being loaded into the van.  Good thing he was there to ""help"".
* AJ's dialogue with the girl in the booth about 'special socks', etc is so fucking cringy.  He's a young, good looking kid and plays the AJ Corlione card if it works but damn if he isn't a complete a brainless toolbox.  
* Bottle service is SO stupid.  Even if you have money - which AJ doesn't. He pays a bill that in today's dollars would be about $3k.  Plus, the $200 he gave Gimli for absolutely no reason.  He was still charged $3k for $400 worth of bad champagne. Yes, he got laid presumably by Omert√† girl but for that sort of cash, he could've bedded that Vegas girl probably 6 times.   
* Speaking of which - Golden Rule of TV series... the first time they introduce a midget character, they're jumping the shark.  (See also Seinfeld).  
* The only time Vito used the elliptical trainer in the den was to get to the baseboard money.  
* Juliana drinks Tony's alcohol instead of the lime rickey or whatever she ordered.  (*She ain't quit.  She just warmin' up*).  
* That was idiotic for Carmella to give AJ what was probably over $600 to buy a suit for ""job or college interviews"".  The fuck?!  College interviews?!  Maybe at the Ivy League but AJ ain't in that team photo.  And the types of jobs he's applying to (Beansies, Blockbuster, etc aren't places you suit up for).  Carm's fault that he bought the clothes for clubbing and the coke.   
* Those people in the room before AJ approaches Uncle Junior and Duff McKagan are hysterical.  You see them on the way out, too.   
* That orderly (Warren) that leads him back looks exactly like Stink Fisher 
* Robert Iler FINALLY puts together ONE scene where he actually isn't half-bad as an actor.  
* That ginger in the club really doesn't dress or look like he would be hanging out with that group.  The guy's a priest for God's sake!  He should be keeping Walt Kowalski from blowing away that Hmung gang.

1jrqbxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1jrqbxd/the_taste_of_words/,The Taste of Words,"

They started as whispers‚Äîjust on the edge of awareness.

The first time I noticed, I was editing an old essay. Every time I typed the word ‚Äúkindness,‚Äù a trace of sugar brushed the back of my tongue, like powdered candy. When I deleted it and wrote ‚Äúcruel,‚Äù the sweetness soured instantly, curdling into something sharp and metallic, like sucking on a rusty nail.

I thought I was going crazy. Maybe I was.

But it kept happening.

Love tasted like strawberries.
Hate like spoiled meat.
Hope fizzed like soda.
Despair was ashes and cold coffee.

It didn‚Äôt matter if I read the word or typed it‚Äîif I thought it with enough intensity, it came. Sweet or sour, bitter or bright. Words had flavors, and I was the only one tasting them.

At first, it was almost fun. A strange, private game. I tested it. Typed lists of random words and recorded the tastes. I even started writing more poetry, just to savor the words that left a honeyed trail on my tongue.

But the novelty wore off the day I started a horror story.

It was just supposed to be a writing exercise. Something short. A little grisly, a little twisted. The kind of thing readers click past at midnight and forget by morning.

But the moment I typed the first death‚Äîan innocent teenage girl drowned in her bathtub‚ÄîI choked.

The taste was coppery. Metallic. Warm.

Blood.

I spit into the sink and wiped my tongue with paper towels, but the taste clung to my throat like syrup. I chugged water. Gargled mouthwash. Nothing helped. It lingered.

I told myself it was stress. That I was working too hard. Sleep-deprived. Imaginative. But deep down, I knew. That taste hadn‚Äôt come from my head.

It had come from the story.

The next morning, it hit the news.
‚ÄúLocal Teen Found Dead in Bathtub. No Foul Play Suspected.‚Äù

Same age. Same description. Same name.

Katie.

I stared at the screen until my vision blurred. My heart thudded in my chest, a hollow drumbeat. I told myself it was a coincidence. It had to be.

But I kept writing.

I couldn‚Äôt help it. Something pushed me. Something hollow and hungry that wanted out.

Another story. Another death.

This time, a man set on fire in his basement.

The taste was worse. Charred meat and burning plastic. I vomited into the sink halfway through the paragraph, but I finished it anyway.

The next day:
‚ÄúHouse Fire Claims Life of Retired Electrician.‚Äù

They found him in the basement.

Same details. Same cause.

I stopped sleeping. My hands trembled constantly. I disconnected my Wi-Fi. Hid my phone. I told myself I wouldn‚Äôt write another word.

But the words didn‚Äôt need a keyboard anymore.

They crept into my head in the silence, slithered through the dark like worms behind my eyes. I tasted them in my sleep. I dreamed them. And when I woke, they were always there‚Äîsticky on my tongue, waiting to be typed. 

Last night, I blacked out.

This morning, I found a new story on my laptop. The file name was just a date. Today‚Äôs date.

I don‚Äôt remember writing it.

It described a man sitting in a dim room, hunched over a desk, bleeding from his mouth, his fingers twitching on the keys. He‚Äôs trying to fight it. Trying to stop what‚Äôs coming. But it‚Äôs too late. The words have taken root.

The story ends without warning‚Äîno final punctuation. Just one sentence, half-finished:

‚ÄúHe knows you‚Äôre reading this now.‚Äù

And in that moment, I tasted something new.

Not blood. Not bile.

You.

I can taste you.

Faint. Unmistakable. Like static on my tongue. Cold, electric fear. The flavor of curiosity laced with dread.

And now, as you read this, tell me‚Äî
What do you taste?

this is my first time writing a post on here but i want to know if my dad really is a narcissist. growing up he cheated on my mom when i was really little, splitting our family up. the abuse was never physical, but very verbal as he would name call and they would fight constantly. after that there was shared custody and i would go over every weekend. my dad was always hyper sexual and had many relationships/ brought many women over. they would all come and go, but around 2019 he met a woman with three kids. we all got really close, they were together for about 5 years, and i loved them as my real family. things were amazing at first. he would treat her amazingly, like love bombing her. as a year or two went by it got much more serious as my dad moved in with her. they fought every day and every night. again never verbal, until around year 3-4. although i know his girlfriend never cheated, he definitely did, causing him to project that onto her and accusing HER of cheating. they would constantly argue, he would call her b*tch, wh*re, sl*t, fat and ugly, and ALWAYS ALWAYS ALWAYYSSS called her psycho. like she was crazy for thinking he was cheating and would gaslight the hell out of her. i watched her physical appearance change extremely. she lost a ton of weight, lost hair, and her spark was completely gone. during the end it got physical, as he would hit her and threaten her. he eventually moved out but remained talking to her, fighting on text, and still linking up to hook up. my dad soon got involved in drugs thought he won‚Äôt admit it, he has and i can tell. i‚Äôve seen coca!ne residue on the coffee table, and he is alcoholic/smokes a lot of pot. his gf/ex did a ton of research on narcissism, and we found out he is absolutely one. he is in denial of it and refuses professional help. he would drag me into their problems and involve me, when i told him to stop, he turned it onto me, would tell me he hates me and i was dead to him. i know he is extremely manipulative. i feel like growing up seeing his behaviors gave me mental damage as well, and is the reason why i have personal problems too ",1,1743810793.0,raisedbynarcissists,1,1.0,False

I‚Äôm writing this at 3 AM, staring at a flickering Chromebook that‚Äôs older than my little sister. The fan sounds like a dying lawnmower, but it‚Äôs the only thing keeping me company tonight. I‚Äôm 16, and I feel like I‚Äôve lived three lifetimes already. Let me try to explain, not for pity, but because I need to know if anyone out there¬†*gets it*.

# Part 1: The Kid Who Wanted to Touch the Stars

When I was 7, I nearly died. Not in some poetic ‚Äúdark night of the soul‚Äù way‚ÄîI mean¬†*actually*¬†died. Doctors cut me open twice for a surgery they botched, and for weeks, I drifted in and out of fever dreams. I remember two things: the smell of antiseptic, and begging my dad for a telescope.

‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù he asked, exhausted.  
‚ÄúBecause if I die,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúI want to memorize the stars first.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt die. But that hunger.,to¬†*know*, to¬†*touch*¬†things bigger than myself, never left. By 9, I was sketching ‚Äúinfinite energy machines‚Äù (they looked like blenders hooked to car engines). By 10, I‚Äôd convinced 1,000 strangers online that my blurry Honda Civic photos were art. Life felt like a game I was winning‚Ä¶ until it wasn‚Äôt.

# Part 2: The Cracks in the Wall

Puberty hit me like a truck. Suddenly, the Quran verses I‚Äôd memorized felt‚Ä¶ sticky. Like someone else‚Äôs words glued to my tongue. I‚Äôd lie awake asking questions that terrified me:

* *If God is all-powerful, why do kids in Gaza pray for food while billionaires build rockets?*
* *Who created God? And if no one did, why can‚Äôt the universe be its own creator?*

I fought it. Oh, I¬†*fought*. I became ‚ÄúThat Muslim Kid‚Äù on Reddit, arguing with atheists at 2 AM. I quoted scientific miracles in the Quran, desperate to prove I wasn‚Äôt wrong. But the harder I pushed, the more the walls cracked.

Then, one night, I broke my phone. No more debates. No more distractions. Just me, a $50 Chromebook, and a void so loud it hummed.

# Part 3: How Linux Saved My Life (No, Really)

That Chromebook became my escape hatch. I taught myself to nuke Chrome OS and install Linux ,not because I‚Äôm a prodigy, but because I had nothing left to lose. For weeks, I drowned in error messages and coffee. But when Arch Linux finally booted up? I cried.

Here‚Äôs why:¬†**Linux doesn‚Äôt lie**. It doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúTrust me, I‚Äôm perfect.‚Äù It says,¬†*‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the code. Break it. Fix it. Make it yours.‚Äù*¬†For the first time, I felt‚Ä¶ control.

# Part 4: Black Holes and Bad Ideas

Now, I‚Äôm obsessed with two things:

1. **Quantum physics**¬†(specifically, whether black holes are cosmic USB drives that¬†*encrypt*¬†information instead of destroying it).
2. **Building a video game**¬†where you fight Greek gods using quantum entanglement (imagine Hades meets¬†*Interstellar*).

Does any of this make sense? Probably not. My ‚Äúgame‚Äù is currently a PNG of a stick figure, and my black hole theory would get me laughed out of any real physics class. But here‚Äôs the thing:¬†**I don‚Äôt care**. For the first time, I‚Äôm asking questions¬†*for me.*¬†not for God, parents, or imaginary internet points.

# Why Am I Posting This?

Because I‚Äôm tired of screaming into the void. I need to know:

* **Ex-Muslims**: How did you rebuild your purpose?
* **Physics nerds**: Am I insane for thinking about quantum encryption in black holes?
* **Anyone**: How do you keep dreaming when the world keeps saying¬†*‚ÄúGrow up‚Äù*?

**TL;DR:**  
16-year-old survives bad surgery, loses faith, falls in love with Linux, and now wants to turn black holes into video game bosses. Seeking others who see the universe as a question mark.

**P.S.**¬†If you‚Äôve read this far, you‚Äôre already my favorite person today.",1,1743810687.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False
1jrqamz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1jrqamz/lpt_the_postcoffeetea_rinse_instantly_fresher/,LPT The Post-Coffee/Tea Rinse: Instantly Fresher Breath and Protect Your Enamel,"Did you know these beverages can temporarily lower your mouth's pH, making your enamel more vulnerable, and contribute to bad breath?  Here's a super simple habit to add to your routine for a noticeable difference. 

Immediately after finishing your coffee, tea, or any other acidic or staining beverage (like soda or juice), simply rinse your mouth with plain water for about 10 seconds.

That's it! No need for another full toothbrushing session right away. Water helps to wash away the acidic residue left by your drink, bringing your mouth's pH back to a more neutral level and protecting your enamel from potential erosion. Rinsing helps to wash away some of the surface pigments that can contribute to staining over time.

It's such a tiny effort, but your breath will thank you, and your dentist will probably be happy too! Give it a shot and see what you think!",28,1743810686.0,LifeProTips,13,0.83,False
1jrq97w,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1jrq97w/still_waiting/,‚ÄúStill waiting‚Äù,"So uhm, I‚Äôve never really been one to get things ‚Äúoff my chest‚Äù in a manner in which I‚Äôm sharing my emotions with complete strangers. So this is knew for me.. and maybe something that‚Äôs new for this sub is how I explain my emotions through poetry. 

It‚Äôs been the only true way I have found to explain how I feel. And this poem
Is about someone I have loved, and will love forever. I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll ever be together again, but we share a child, and have a great coparenting relationship.

Anyway here‚Äôs my poem to her that she will never see.  

I see you smile,
but I know that smile.
It doesn‚Äôt reach
the way it used to.

You walk beside him
shoulders close,
fingers linked
but your gaze slips sometimes,
like you‚Äôre chasing something
just out of reach.

And maybe he‚Äôs good to you.
Maybe he says the right things,
remembers your coffee order,
asks about your day.
But I wonder if his arms
ever feel like home.

I thought I understood what we had
something rare,
unshaken,
alive.
But I mishandled it,
let the weight of my wounds
become the sharp edge
that cut you away.

You tried.
God, you tried.
But I was too proud,
too afraid of being seen.
And you needed more
than I knew how to give.

Now I sit in the quiet,
where your laughter used to echo.
And you sit beside him,
laughing still
but it sounds different.
Lighter.
Hollow, maybe.

I know it‚Äôs not perfect.
I see it in the way your eyes
wander when you think no one‚Äôs watching.
In the way you touch him
like you‚Äôre remembering
how it used to feel
to burn.

I won‚Äôt lie
I wish you‚Äôd look back.
Not with guilt,
just with truth.
Because what we had
wasn‚Äôt flawless,
but it was real.

And maybe you miss it
on the nights when his hands
don‚Äôt know where you ache.
Maybe you still hear my voice
when it rains.
Maybe.

I‚Äôm not here to wreck what you‚Äôve built.
I know better now.
I‚Äôve learned to love quietly,
without breaking things.
But still
if you ever turn around,
even just once,
I‚Äôll be here.
Not waiting to steal you back,
but ready to be better
than I was.

Because I never stopped loving you.
Even when I should have.
Even when you didn‚Äôt.
And maybe that means nothing now
but maybe,
one day,
it might mean just enough.

1jrq8qx,https://www.reddit.com/r/MicrosoftFlightSim/comments/1jrq8qx/i_would_trade_my_yoke_my_rudder_pedals_and/,"I would trade my yoke, my rudder pedals, and possibly my dignity for a study-level DC-10","I‚Äôm not proud of how badly I want this. No, let me rephrase. I *ache* for it. My desire for a study-level DC-10 in MSFS isn‚Äôt casual. It‚Äôs not some idle wish I toss out when scrolling through the marketplace. It‚Äôs visceral. It's deep. It‚Äôs the kind of longing that keeps me up at night, staring at the ceiling, imagining the glow of analog gauges softly illuminating a smoky cockpit while a flight engineer whispers sweet nothings about fuel trim and hydraulic pressure.

I don‚Äôt just want to fly the DC-10. I want to *know* her. I want to wrap myself in that wide-body, three-engined glory and never let go. I want to flip every switch in that overhead panel with trembling fingers and a heart full of reverence. I want to hear those GE CF6s spooling up in my dreams ‚Äî not as sound effects, but as lullabies.

There's something about the DC-10 that just *does it* for me. The way she straddles the line between old-school analog charm and the early days of automation. The honest complexity. The stubbornness. The fact that she demands not just a pilot, but a *crew*. A flight engineer‚Äôs panel full of cryptic dials and gauges? Inject it directly into my veins.

And don't even get me started on that center engine intake. God help me, I would write poetry about that S-duct. It‚Äôs beautiful. It‚Äôs absurd. It‚Äôs aerodynamic foreplay.

I‚Äôve tried substitutes. I‚Äôve even stared too long at screenshots of the TFDi MD-11, hoping it might *feel* close enough. But it never is. It‚Äôs like trying to kiss someone who doesn‚Äôt kiss back.

I want the full experience. Cold and dark startup. Proper fuel balancing. Engine fire drills over the mid-Atlantic. A cockpit that's 40% airplane, 60% ashtray. I want to set the trim wrong and feel the yoke fight me. I want to scream ""why is this still climbing"" and mean it.

So developers, if you're out there, lurking in these threads, reading between the lines of our begging and banter: *please*. Give us this. Give us the DC-10 in all her analog, smoke-stained, triple-engine glory. I will beta test. I will pay extra. I will watch every YouTube video from 1993 to learn the startup sequence. I will write sonnets in your honor.

Until then, I‚Äôll be sitting on the tarmac in my PMDG 737, pretending. Pretending the gauges are rounder, the climb rate more aggressive, the autopilot more passive-aggressive. Pretending I‚Äôm somewhere over Greenland, trimming fuel with a flight engineer named Jon who smells like coffee and 30,000 hours of flight time.

And when I finally shut her down at the gate, I whisper into the silence: *soon*.",8,1743810527.0,MicrosoftFlightSim,6,0.83,False

25F INTJ here. This is my final attempt, my last mission, to find a husband. I‚Äôve tried putting myself out there in many ways, but each experience feels worse than the last. Reddit is the one place I haven‚Äôt tried yet, so here I am, holding onto one last thread of hope that maybe, just maybe, someone out there is looking for the same depth I am.

So, get comfortable, grab a cup of tea or coffee. This will be a long one.

I‚Äôm 25, female, INTJ, living in a European country. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù (1.73 m), Muslim, and of Middle Eastern background, all things that seem to complicate my chances of finding a good match. Add to that the rarity of being a female INTJ, and here we are.

I‚Äôve tried the usual route, a certain popular Muslim dating app, and while I‚Äôve matched with people who seemed promising, things often ended abruptly, usually with vague discomfort or vanishing acts. I‚Äôve started to feel like I lose a piece of myself every time I connect with someone who isn‚Äôt serious or emotionally present. I give a lot, and getting little in return is slowly wearing down my soul.

Before giving up entirely, I wanted to try Reddit as a final space to see if there are still like-minded people out there who want something real.

So, about me:
1. I‚Äôm pursuing a Master‚Äôs in science (I‚Äôll keep the exact field private for now), and I‚Äôll graduate within a year.
2. I love baking (lately it‚Äôs been my go-to hobby), long walks, and the gym‚Äîyes, I lift weights, and no, I don‚Äôt look manly.
3. I value emotional depth, loyalty, and intellectual conversations. I want to talk about the real stuff, the layered stuff; ideas, feelings, growth.
4. I can be logical and intense, but also deeply loyal, funny, and warm when I feel safe. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôd be perfect if I were a man with this sense of humor, but alas, here I am.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
1. A man who is emotionally and intellectually mature, serious about building a future, and not scared of depth.
2. Someone with a similar level of educational background, ambitious but grounded, someone who can hold space for nuance and connection.
3. I won‚Äôt lie, intellectual chemistry is key. I want to think with you, laugh with you, and build with you. Also, who wouldn‚Äôt want someone to talk about how chickens and dinosaurs are related?! And that the penguins we know are not the real penguins üåù
4. As for physical preferences: taller than me and in good shape would be appreciated.

1jrq2t5,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1jrq2t5/help_whats_wrong_with_my_writing_it_sounds_off/,"HELP! Whats wrong with my writing? It sounds off, but I love the idea of it so far. (This is only my draft and its unfinished)","Andy stared blankly at the empty booth across from him. It had been at least two months since they planned this trip, and he wasn't so sure Calvin would show. It wasn‚Äôt the first time he‚Äôd been stood up. Andy‚Äôs demanding job at the lumber mill left little free time, making things like this rare. He opened a pack of Marlboros and slumped into the bench, deciding if he should call for the bill. He looked out the cloudy diner window and studied the cars driving down the road. The conversations surrounding him faded into the background as he sank into deep thought, completely unaware that Calvin had taken a seat across from him.



‚ÄúAndy?‚Äù Calvin tapped on the table to get his attention.



He whipped his head around and quickly put out his cigarette, ‚ÄúCal! Man, you actually made it!‚Äù¬†



Calvin let out a short laugh, ‚ÄúYeah, well, I wouldn't let you down. Considering you drove five some hours to be here.‚Äù¬†



Andy let out a relieved sigh, then reached over to put his hand on Calvin‚Äôs. But just as their hands touched, Calvin snatched his hand away, then frantically checked for judgmental stares. He understood Calvin's anxiety, hell you‚Äôd be crazy not to feel even a little paranoid doing what they were doing. But even knowing that, the rejection still painfully stung. The waitress walked by with a pot of coffee, finally breaking the awkward silence.¬†



‚ÄúAre you boys set to order?‚Äù¬†¬†



‚ÄúUh‚Ä¶ no, but thank you ma'am, we‚Äôre just on our way out.‚Äù Calvin politely waved her off.¬† ‚ÄúSuit yourselves,‚Äù she sassily quipped as she sauntered away to serve the next customers.



‚ÄúYour really choppin‚Äô at the bit to get outta here huh?‚Äù Andy said

‚ÄúOh yeah‚Ä¶sorry,‚Äù Calvin scratched the back of his neck. ‚ÄúWere you uh, hungry or somethin?‚Äù¬†¬†



Andy shrugged. ‚ÄúNot really. Just figured we‚Äôd have more than five minutes to catch up, but I guess we got a whole weekend for that.‚Äù Calvin looked down at the floor and smiled, ‚ÄúYeah.‚Äù



Wordlessly, the two gathered any of their belongings and shuffled out the door. Calvin retrieved his bags from his truck, double-checking that it was locked and parked safely behind the diner. And Andy slid into his rust-bitten truck, the engine sputtering before finally turning over. He gripped the wheel, watching Calvin in the rearview mirror as he tossed his duffel into the truck bed. Then rested the side of his head against the window for a moment, gathering himself. Calvin climbed into the passenger seat, exhaling sharply as he shut the door.

¬†

""You good to drive?"" he asked, his voice calmer now. Andy nodded.¬†

""Yeah."" He shifted the truck into gear and pulled onto the road. They still had a good few miles ahead.



‚ÄúSo, how‚Äôs the camp?‚Äù Calvin finally asked randomly.

Andy exhaled, dragging a hand through his hair. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs, well, it‚Äôs fine. Long hours, cold mornings, trees. Not much else to say.‚Äù

Calvin happily nodded. ‚ÄúAnd the guys? They still just as bad?‚Äù

Andy smirked. ‚ÄúNothing new.‚Äù

¬†Calvin tapped his fingers against his knee, watching the world blur past in the window. ‚ÄúYeah, I figured,‚Äù Calvin said quietly, eyes still tracing the highway‚Äôs endless stretch. ‚ÄúHey, you ever thought about leaving? I mean, doing something different with your life?‚Äù

Andy had thought about it before‚Äî he was still working the same job after almost a decade. But something in him felt stunted after Calvin quit; strangely the job had become a source of sentimentality‚Äîa constant day to day reminder of their love. Or what was left of it at least. Leaving it behind felt like severing the last aspect of control to what they once had. Calvin didnt seem to mind any of this, but his paranoia is what ultimately drove them apart. That fear is why he moved hours away, why he stopped answering calls for weeks at a time, why their meetings had dwindled to rare quick catch ups like this one. Andy had tried to be patient, to understand, but watching Calvin try to heal from him like a virus had worn him down.¬†

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know what else I‚Äôd do.‚Äù Andy responded, forcing a laugh after.

The conversation died down, mostly because there was not much else to be said that felt good enough to break the silence. Neither of them had felt like it anyway.

  


The difference between the air of the stuffy truck and breezy mountain was immediately noticeable. The campsite was nestled deep in the woods, hidden by towering pine trees that slowly swayed in the wind. Gravel crunched under the tires as he pulled into the clearing.

Calvin stretched as soon as he stepped out, rolling his shoulders and taking in the view. ‚ÄúDamn,‚Äù he closed his eyes and breathed in deeply, ‚Äúforgot what fresh air smells like,‚Äù he muttered. Andy on the other hand was already set on getting the gear out and set up. ‚ÄúC‚Äômon, help me get this stuff up to the camp spot before it starts gettin‚Äô dark.‚Äù Finally they go to laugh and reminisce about old memories as they went about setting up. Calvin was different up here, slightly looser. Being isolated in nature there's a liberation, and you seem to subconsciously exist as you are.¬†



As the sun set the faint hum of crickets grew.¬† The fire projected a faint warm glow onto them, and the trees became silhouettes that slowly disappeared into complete darkness. Andy sat leaning back on his elbows, and Calvin sat a couple feet away, nervously fiddling with a half empty pack of matches. Andy exhaled and tilted his head back, watching the stars appear. Hesitantly he moved closer to Calvin, just enough so that he could wrap his hands around him.¬†¬†

Calvin flinched and jerked away. His hands twitched like he might shove Andy back, but he froze before he could. Andy started to pull away, realizing his attempt was foolish. But before he could, Calvin let out a sharp breath and suddenly melted into Andy. Calvin gripped the zippers of Andy‚Äôs jacket, his fingers twisting into the worn fabric as his whole body trembled. It was like something in him had finally cracked, Andy‚Äôs shoulder, and then he broke‚Äîsilent at first, then in quiet, shuddering sobs.

i‚Äôm a FTM 6 month PP. I have struggled with PPA but i think now it‚Äôs settling into PPD as well. 

i have started to feel enraged towards my husband (i felt this early on in my PP journey but it went away, and now is back). I‚Äôm exhausted and overwhelmed and some days my baby frustrates me incredibly. i love her so much but in the past two months she had extreme silent reflux i didn‚Äôt recognize and it made her aversed to bottles, and on top of that she is teething. not to mention my own mother who lives in a different state was hospitalized for a week and luckily okay! i have been pushed to my limits of frustration, anxiety (couldn‚Äôt eat or sleep), every day i do the same thing just to make it through the day. i‚Äôve reached out for help to my pcp and am hoping to try medication. Most days i feel empty and out of sorts, i have a lot of high points and low points in a day‚Ä¶.. i don‚Äôt feel suicidal, just not much of anything except irritation and bouts of rage and perpetual anxious intrusive thoughts that im going to die or pass out all the time. 

i guess im looking to hear if you‚Äôve tried medication how was it for you? 
if you had PPD did it manifest in similar ways? 
i feel like the shittiest mom alive most days because i let her watch two episodes of bluey so i can drink my cup of coffee while it‚Äôs hot and try to wake up enough to play. 
i have basically no help most of the time, my husband works a lot and night shifts‚Ä¶. but i think i still hold so much anger towards him because he should be able to function on less than 8 hrs of sleep, and he‚Äôs almost always getting 8hrs uninterrupted. i average probably 3 hours of uninterrupted sleep a night these past two months.

1jrq1lu,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1jrq1lu/my_first_attempt_black_lace_chapter_one/,My first attempt (Black Lace: chapter one),"I have never left the city. This is where I was born and raised. It's not a big city like most people would think, it looks like a town from the outside view. Yet if you look closely at the population and the amount of buildings it is most certainly a city. The state capital is in the major part of the city which is an hour away with all the traffic, and somehow i've never been.

 I am 18 years old, today is my birthday and my parents are making it a huge deal like they do everything. I always knew in my heart they are good people, and they seem that way too, but their actions behind closed doors make it seem like maybe they aren't such good people after all. They have no idea I've packed what I want and snuck most of my belongings out in the last few weeks. Tonight is the night I'm going to become a free woman. I've been your stereotypically blond haired, blue eyed, skinny cheerleader my whole life. I'm tired of getting good grades and going to football games. I just want to be free, free of the Sunday church and free of the long family dinners where we talk about faith and all that's happened through the day. I have always been a good girl when that's not who I really am. Even if I wanted to rebel, no one would rebel with the pastor's daughter. 

I plan on moving into a small town in another state. I am not going far but one state away is a small town in the mountains that I think is far enough away that my parents won't find me. I already have a friend who is going to drive me there tonight after my parents go to sleep. I even have a place to stay with his mom. I have been friends with Patrick since I can remember, he is on the football team and we have been fake dating since freshman year of highschool. He knows my secret and dates me to keep it that way, so when his parents divorced and his mom moved, it gave me a chance to go stay with her and be safe for a bit while I figure out life. His whole family knows im gay, and they accept me, they don't care that i'm different. They always told me as long as I don't do anything to hurt Patrick they would support me with my secrets.. I would never hurt my best friend because he is the only one who knows. 

My family has no idea where Laura moved, they just know that it was a messy divorce after Mark cheated and Patrick wanted to finish out highschool here before going to college. Dinner with my parents was awful. Mom talked about her job at the community center, my younger brother talked about how his girlfriend dumped him. My baby sister talked all about the promise ring her boyfriend gave her and worst of all my father went on and on about what next week's sermon. I never understood how two kids can say they are dating when they are in 8th grade or worse my brother is only in 5th grade. Somehow my parents are okay with them dating yet I had to wait till highschool. Thankfully since it's my birthday we had my favorite food. Moms homemade vegetarian lasagna with extra ricotta cheese.

 Patrick showed up at eleven pm on the dot, he has always been very punctual. It took us five hours to get there with only two breaks to use the bathroom. Neither of us slept, we kept a conversation for most of the drive and when we weren't talking we were blasting music singing to each other. It was just about four am when we got there. His mom was still asleep but he had a key so we walked in and put our bags down. Her home is small, maybe nine hundred square feet, yet the oak floors and deep green walls made it seem cozy and comforting. The center of the living room had a small black wood stove. All the furniture was quaint yet perfect. With plants in the windows and an orange cat asleep on the sofa, it was peaceful. I savored every moment of being free. Patrick then showed me the guest room where I would be staying till I got on my feet fully. I had a job all through highschool and had quite a bit of money saved but It isn't enough to just have money, you also have to have a job, home, and transportation to be on your own and Laura wanted to support me while I did that.

The guest room matched the rest of the house, its deep forest green with plants and lightly colored antique furniture. It was beautiful with plants around the room placed perfectly. I placed my bags on the chair placed across from the bed next to a long dresser maybe waist high. I crawled into the bed and Patrick knocked on the door as he slowly pushed it open. 
‚ÄúHey, um do you think i can sleep in the bed with you so my mom doesn't wake me up in a few hours‚Äù He was so quiet I could barely hear him. I just nodded my head in response. We had shared a bed before so it wasn't a big deal to me but he always was the most polite when it came to being close in contact. He closed the door and slid under the blankets with me, I scooted towards him and rested my head next to his shoulder. With my eyes closed I whispered to him 
‚ÄúThank you, for everything‚Äù and as a response he just mumbled 
‚ÄúOf course, Fee‚Äù I always hated that nickname from anyone other than him. Normally I go by my full name which is Ophealia, or Ophealia Grace Anderson, But as kids Patrick could never pronounce that and he called me Fee, which kind of stuck, but I never let anyone else use that name because that was his. 

I woke up that morning to an empty bed and a note on my nightstand. As I read it I began to smile. 
‚Äú Dear Fee, Mom and I went to the store to pick up some groceries, we should be back soon. I left you breakfast on the table and your iced coffee is in the fridge. Bathroom is the door on the left when you exit your room and I left some toiletries by the bathtub so you can shower. We will be home around two pm, make yourself at home, TV is all set up in your room and the wifi password is Lavender123'' I got up and walked to the bathroom, sure enough to find a bunch of lavender scented bath products and a toothbrush and some toothpaste. I took a shower, realizing that I don't know where I put my phone. As I dried off I put a towel around me, brushed my teeth and walked back to the guest room. 

I looked through my bags and found my phone, dead. I Put on some clothes, then found my charger and plugged in my phone. I decided I was gonna leave it off on the charger and walked to the kitchen. I glanced around with the sunlight streaming in, I saw a plate wrapped in clear wrap on the table. Still waking up I walked to the fridge and found a togo cup of ice coffee with a sticky note that had my name on it in his moms handwriting. The ice was nearly completely melted yet it tasted amazing. I sat at the table in silence as I ate the veggie omelet and drank the coffee they got me. It felt amazing. I felt free and calm. After breakfast I threw out the empty cup and washed my plate and fork they had set out for me. 

Walking back to the room I heard a car door slam which spooked me. I turned around and walked to the door opening it to see a forest of pine trees and the scent of dewy pine needles. A beautiful sight with the sun shining from above and a small car in the driveway with Patrick standing outside talking to his mom still in the car. 
When they noticed me they both smiled and happily said good morning,
‚ÄúHow did you sleep, Fee?‚Äù I smiled as i said
‚ÄúI slept well, thank you so much for breakfast‚Äù
‚ÄúOh, that was all my mom, I was just gonna give you the wifi password but she insisted i set out breakfast and toiletries for you‚Äù Patrick replied with a smile and shrug
‚ÄúWell then, thank you laura, I appreciate it, Thank you so much‚Äù I responded Laura quickly said 
‚Äú Oh no problem, I'm just glad to see you again and I've never seen you smile so much, its refreshing‚Äù  

I smiled and gave her a hug as we all walked in, they talked about what they are gonna do for the rest of the day, Patrick mentioned he is gonna stay in and rest, while Laura said shes gonna go out with friends tonight. I chimed in and said I would be happy to stay in with Pat and maybe binge watch some anime. He smiled real big and Laura happily nodded and went to her room to presumably get ready to go out in a bit, she always did take hours to get ready. 

	Patrick looks at me from the kitchen, while I'm in the hall. 
‚ÄúYou have a few more boxes and bags in my car, we can grab those before we watch TV. That way we can put up some of your things to make your room feel like yours while you live here‚Äù He was kind with his words and made it seem like he wants me to act like this is my home while I live here. I thought for a second, 
‚ÄúYeah, I don't have very many things that go on walls or anything, I mean I kept a few photos of us as kids but honestly I mostly brought clothes and shoes and stuff that I would need on a daily basis. I did bring a lamp that you made me out of the halloween skeleton decoration, but not much else‚Äù. As I said this he smiled and slowly nodded, 
‚ÄúWell then we can set up your lamp and the few things you did bring, so it feels like a safe place until you get your own place. I never thought that silly lamp would mean so much to you.‚Äù I smiled real big 
‚ÄúOkay, and that lamp was the only gift I got that year, so Its special to me‚Äù He frowned and looked sad by the fact that my family never got me gifts, but I always told them it wasn't a big deal since my birthday is the day after school ends every year so it's a time of year when all their money is being spent on yearbooks and trips with friends to celebrate the end of the year, Often my family would forget my birthday but I always knew Pat's family would remember.

	I put on my shoes and Pat walked out to his car with me making small talk, we grabbed a few boxes and put them in my room, then Pat said 
‚Äúwhy don't you stay here while i grab the rest, you can unpack a bit and put stuff into the dresser, and then we can watch TV.‚Äù I smiled real big and started to unpack while he went back to the car to grab the last few bags of my clothes. I put away some shoes under the dresser and set my makeup on top of the dresser next to the mirror on the wall. I was putting some clothes in the dresser when he came back with two bags in each hand. He set them on the bench at the end of the bed. I smiled at him as he made the bed. I continued what I was doing until Pat said 
‚Äúwanna watch TV?‚Äù and I nodded and smiled at him sitting next to him on the bed looking at the TV which was across the room above the small mirror on the wall which is above the dresser. He put on an anime that we have watched again and again since we were young teens. It's about an alien teacher and assassin students. 

	Once we started the show we were both on our stomachs watching the TV, he went to check his phone and glanced at me. He seemed unsure if he wanted to say anything but he managed to get out a few words.
 	‚ÄúUm, your parents are worried, they think you're missing‚Ä¶‚Äù My eyes went big, I forgot that I would have to text them. I pulled my Phone off the charger  holding the power button to start up my phone as it pulled up my lockscreen of a garden and flowers then saw the 99+ notifications while my phone dinged with every new one. I started by looking at the people who aren't my family and responded to a few old friends. Then I looked at my siblings, mostly missed calls from them but a few texts saying, 
‚Äúwhere are you?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere did you go‚Äù and I texted them back, 
‚ÄúI went away for a while‚Äù. Then I opened my parents messages, mom was freaking out saying 
‚Äú Where did you go, Are you okay, What happened, Im getting worried, Ophealia respond to us, we need to make sure your okay, were you kidnapped, please honey respond‚Äù I texted her the exact same thing but I added 
‚Äú Please don't contact me for a while, I need space‚Äù and finally my father only left 1 text 
‚Äú Your mother is worried, text her back please‚Äù I just said 
‚Äúok‚Äù and left it at that. Most of the damn notifications were all missed calls from mom and a few from the others. I looked up from my phone to see Pat smiling at the tv. 
‚ÄúI responded to them, hopefully they will get the hint to leave me alone‚Äù He smiled at me and we continued watching Tv.

	After a while I fell asleep and I guess Pat got up and made dinner because I woke up around one in the morning. He was asleep but there was a plate and a note saying I slept through dinner and I should eat. So I ate the small salad and baked salmon, and slowly got up to put my dishes away. As quietly as I could I washed my dishes and put them on the little black drying rack. I went back to the room and went to sleep under the blankets next to Pat. When I woke up it was six in the morning. I have always been a morning person. I love the early mornings, you feel the fresh air, and you can hear the birds but nothing else. Mornings are perfect, they are peaceful. Pat was still asleep so once again I snuck out of the room, grabbing some clothes for the day and went to the bathroom. I took a long shower so I could wash my hair properly. I stood there so I could feel the hot water hit my skin, and slide off down my legs. After I got out and dried off I put on my skinny ripped blue jeans and a white skin tight cropped tank top with thick straps. I left the bathroom and went to the room again, while still being quiet I put on some light makeup. Mascara, lip gloss, blush and thin liner above my eyes. I grabbed my phone from the charger, which I don't remember putting there,then I grabbed my burnt orange and yellow flannel and Pats car keys. I know he won't wake up till around nine am and I'm not worried he will get mad since he lets me drive his car so I quietly sneak out of the house. 

	With google maps telling me where to go, I drive down the mountain side towards a small town. Through a cute little town made of old stone, brick, and stained wood, I find a parking spot in a small lot next to the diner at the end of what I presumed to be main street. I get out of the car, lock it behind me and walk down the sidewalk to a hole in the wall coffee shop that has 5 stars on yelp. I finally found it part way down an alley. I walk into the brick cafe with windows on either side of the door. The inside was natural wood and reclaimed furniture to make it look like a home, in the corner there's a wooden ladder that is sloped so you could walk up with a black curtain at the top. I walked up to the counter to look at the menu on an old chalkboard. 

Looking at the menu for a few minutes a woman, maybe 19 or 20, walks up to the counter. I can't help but notice, her natural dark brown hair with deep blue streaks is messy but above her head in a bun and she has an undercut maybe up to the top of her ears. She is in a black shirt that is perfectly fitted over her breasts and loose over her stomach. Her black jeans are ripped all the way up and loose fitting just above her hips with a green apron so dark it's nearly a shade of black wrapped in the belt loops holding her jeans up. She looked perfect. Flustered as she watched me stare her up and down she asked sweetly ignoring my stares.

‚ÄúGood morning, what can I get for you today? '' Her voice was deep, slightly raspy but still feminine. 
‚ÄúUm hi, can I get a um large iced caramel macchiato‚Äù I barely stuttered it out and she smirked and nodded 
‚ÄúIs that all today?‚Äù she asked confidently, I nodded and she smirked again. She was subtly looking me up and down 
‚ÄúYour total is $5.25, I haven't seen you here before, are you visiting?‚Äù she said while smiling with her perfect teeth showing
‚ÄúOkay yeah of course one sec‚Äù I pulled out my debit card and paid as i finished my statement
""Actually um I am moving here, so yeah, you might see me a bit more often‚Äù As i said this she smiled real big and casualty kept our conversation going as she made my drink
‚ÄúWell if you are just moving here, welcome to our small town of Little Falls, maybe I can show you around sometime?‚Äù  She said with confidence and casually smiling. 
‚ÄúOh um yeah, I'd love that, do you know any good book stores close by‚Äù as soon as i said that she smiled 
‚ÄúHow about we meet here tonight at 6, and as for book stores, there is one but its old and not many people go there, I do recommend while you drink this you go up the ladder to the secret spot, I don't think anyone is in the loft right now so you will have it to yourself‚Äù 

She handed me my coffee and while a bit confused I walked up the ladder and through the black curtain. As soon as I stepped in I paused in awe. The loft was a hidden book room, with bookshelves full to the brim against every wall, twinkle lights across the tops and pillows strewn across the floor with two small tables maybe a foot tall to sit and read at. I looked around this beautiful room with the sun just peeking in through the sky lights. I set my coffee down on a table and looked around at all the books, they were not organized to any standards yet it was fun to look at the piles of books and the shelves full to the brim with books sitting against the shelves were stacks of books nearly two feet tall. I pulled out a book, brought it to where I left my coffee, then I sat down and read while I drank my morning coffee.
 It was a cute book I hadn't read before about a young girl coming out to her family. I got a quarter of the way done with the book, and finished off my coffee before I checked the time. It was already seven forty five. I put my receipt in the book and left it on one of the piles of books. I walked down the ladder, threw away my cup and as I was about to walk out I was interrupted.
‚ÄúHey I made you a second coffee, I wasn't sure how long you would be up there‚Äù The coffee girl handed me another Large Iced Caramel macchiato and smiled as I turned to leave. I said thank you. I started walking back to my car sipping my coffee when I realized this time my cup had writing on it. Which said 
‚ÄúSee you at 6? her phone number and Milo‚Äù, with a heart next to her name. When I read this my heart skipped a beat and my stomach started feeling funny, like butterflies I guess. I have never been with a woman let alone talk to one that I like. Where I'm from that's a sin but I guess here it's okay because the heart definitely made it seem like she was flirting with me.

I've (30m) been on Accutane for 2 months now. Just got home from my checkup for the 3rd month round. My liver enzymes are quite high, at 81 up from 64 from the first checkup. 

My doctor accused me of continuing to drink despite having not drank anything other than coffee, redbull, or water and a total of 6 non-alc beers for the last 3 months. I've been doing between 5-8 glasses of water a day. He said he's not hopeful for the following checkup next month since it's likely my liver will not stabilize and will continue to go up past the legal limit of 88 and we will have to cancel the regimen. 

I really want to avoid this since I've already put up with the bad side effects which hit really hard the first month and have lessened substantially since I doubled my water intake this month. 

Am I cooked? Or is there something I can do or take to reverse the increase of liver enzymes? I did ask at the appointment if there was anything I could do and all he said was ""increase water intake to 9-10 12oz glasses a day"" and hit me with a shrug and walked out of the room.

25F INTJ here. This is my final attempt, my last mission, to find a husband. I‚Äôve tried putting myself out there in many ways, but each experience feels worse than the last. Reddit is the one place I haven‚Äôt tried yet, so here I am, holding onto one last thread of hope that maybe, just maybe, someone out there is looking for the same depth I am.

So, get comfortable, grab a cup of tea or coffee. This will be a long one.

I‚Äôm 25, female, INTJ, living in a European country. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù (1.73 m), Muslim, and of Middle Eastern background, all things that seem to complicate my chances of finding a good match. Add to that the rarity of being a female INTJ, and here we are.

I‚Äôve tried the usual route, a certain popular Muslim dating app, and while I‚Äôve matched with people who seemed promising, things often ended abruptly, usually with vague discomfort or vanishing acts. I‚Äôve started to feel like I lose a piece of myself every time I connect with someone who isn‚Äôt serious or emotionally present. I give a lot, and getting little in return is slowly wearing down my soul.

Before giving up entirely, I wanted to try Reddit as a final space to see if there are still like-minded people out there who want something real.

So, about me:
1. I‚Äôm pursuing a Master‚Äôs in science (I‚Äôll keep the exact field private for now), and I‚Äôll graduate within a year.
2. I love baking (lately it‚Äôs been my go-to hobby), long walks, and the gym‚Äîyes, I lift weights, and no, I don‚Äôt look manly.
3. I value emotional depth, loyalty, and intellectual conversations. I want to talk about the real stuff, the layered stuff; ideas, feelings, growth.
4. I can be logical and intense, but also deeply loyal, funny, and warm when I feel safe. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôd be perfect if I were a man with this sense of humor, but alas, here I am.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
1. A man who is emotionally and intellectually mature, serious about building a future, and not scared of depth.
2. Someone with a similar level of educational background, ambitious but grounded, someone who can hold space for nuance and connection.
3. I won‚Äôt lie, intellectual chemistry is key. I want to think with you, laugh with you, and build with you. Also, who wouldn‚Äôt want someone to talk about how chickens and dinosaurs are related?! And that the penguins we know are not the real penguins üåù
4. As for physical preferences: taller than me and in good shape would be appreciated.

**DATE:** April 4, 2025  
**REPORT ID:**  
**CLASSIFICATION:** UNCLASSIFIED

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Western Balkan organized crime groups (OCGs) have emerged as transcontinental players in the global cocaine economy. Over the last two decades, these networks have established deep-rooted connections with South American drug production hubs, forming a durable presence in the international narcotics trade. Their operational evolution‚Äîfrom Balkan-based smugglers to reliable wholesale brokers‚Äîhas been facilitated by wartime experience, diaspora networks, political instability at home, and strategic opportunism in volatile Latin American transit states.

Open-source analysis and criminal intelligence reporting confirm that Balkan networks now control significant portions of the supply chain from South America to Europe, and have demonstrated resilience, adaptability, and strategic cunning in consolidating their influence. Their activities have contributed to rising violence in Latin America and a sustained increase in cocaine availability in Europe. Left unchecked, these groups pose an enduring threat to both regional stability and Western counternarcotics frameworks.

**STRATEGIC CONTEXT**

The strategic positioning of the Balkans as a historical crossroads linking Eastern and Western Europe has been exploited by these criminal networks, facilitating the evolution from local illicit economies‚Äîinitially focused on heroin, cannabis, cigarettes, and fuel‚Äîto sophisticated cocaine distribution operations. The conflicts of the 1990s sharpened their logistical capabilities, experience in covert operations, and predisposition toward using extreme violence, attributes effectively transferred into cocaine trafficking. Such wartime experience granted Balkan criminals a notable advantage, enabling them to establish control in hostile and competitive international criminal environments.

A critical factor facilitating their rise has been the consistent increase in cocaine production in Latin America‚Äîparticularly in Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia‚Äîcoupled with sustained high demand within European markets. Production in the Andes nearly doubled from less than 1,000 tonnes annually in 2014 to approximately 2,000 tonnes in recent years, fueling availability and intensifying trafficking activity. Political instability, weak governance structures, and endemic corruption in Latin American countries have further enhanced operational freedom for these Balkan networks.

**OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE AND METHODS**

Rather than direct territorial control, Western Balkan criminal groups focus primarily on establishing strong logistical and commercial relationships within the cocaine supply chain. These groups rarely occupy leadership positions directly in Latin America; instead, senior members typically operate from European capitals, their home regions, or secure third-party locations such as the United Arab Emirates. This decentralized leadership structure reduces exposure to local law enforcement and violent disputes, allowing operations to remain covert and flexible.

Key facilitators in Latin America‚Äîoften business intermediaries or brokers‚Äîoversee procurement negotiations, logistics, and corruption of local officials. Frequently, legitimate businesses owned by Balkan nationals, such as import-export companies, provide cover for smuggling cocaine concealed in goods like bananas, coffee, seafood, and fruit juices. Europol-led investigations highlight that nearly half of significant cocaine trafficking operations interdicted in recent years were linked to Balkan criminal networks, underlining their increasing strategic importance.

Balkan groups demonstrate a distinct preference for maritime transportation, with approximately 89% of cocaine seized in Europe linked to sea-based shipments. Common maritime conveyances include commercial container ships, fishing vessels, speedboats, semi-submersibles, and occasionally drones. Notably, container ships are preferred due to their high cargo volume and limited scrutiny‚Äîonly 2-3% of containers undergo inspection. The strategic ports of Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Algeciras, Valencia, and Gioia Tauro serve as principal European entry points, while Balkan ports such as Bar (Montenegro), Durres (Albania), and Rijeka (Croatia) act as secondary distribution hubs.

**A. International Reach**

Estimates indicate that **40‚Äì60%** of Balkan OCG activity is now international in scope. Their operations span:

* **South America**: Storage, procurement, and port-level logistics.
* **Europe**: Wholesale distribution via ports in **Antwerp, Rotterdam, Valencia**, and **Gioia Tauro**, among others.
* **Global**: Large-scale seizures linked to Balkan groups have occurred in **North America, Australia, and Africa**.

**B. Leadership and Modus Operandi**

Despite their South American operations, leaders of these groups typically reside in:

* **Western Europe**: For proximity to end markets.
* **Western Balkans**: Leveraging weak judicial systems.
* **UAE**: As a haven for fugitives.

**TACTICS, TECHNIQUES, AND PROCEDURES (TTPs)**

**A. Transportation**

* Maritime dominance: \~89% of seizures involve sea-based methods.
* Preferred vessels: Container ships, semi-submersibles, fishing boats.
* Concealment strategies: Liquid cocaine in tanks, powder among perishables (e.g., bananas, seafood).

Example: Ecuador‚Äôs export of bananas (1/3 of EU consumption) is exploited by Balkan OCGs using shell import-export firms to hide drugs in legitimate cargo.

**B. Entry Points**

* Primary: Antwerp, Rotterdam, Hamburg, Algeciras.
* Secondary/Regional: Bar (Montenegro), Durres (Albania), Rijeka (Croatia).

These entry hubs suffer from low inspection rates (2‚Äì3%), high container volume, and bureaucratic backlogs‚Äîconditions favorable to trafficking.

**C. Partnership and Covert Integration**

* Balkan traffickers are preferred by producers in Ecuador and Peru due to:
   * Reliability and consistent cash payments.
   * Limited engagement in violent turf wars.
   * Willingness to cooperate discreetly.

**IMPACT ON LATIN AMERICA AND EUROPE**

The increasing involvement of Western Balkan groups in South America has coincided with heightened violence in key transit hubs, especially Ecuador, where at least 19 individuals connected to Balkan cocaine operations have been murdered since 2010. Additionally, these criminal networks leverage existing local criminal tensions, exploiting the vacuum left by the demobilization of significant guerrilla factions such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Smaller groups filling these vacuums often cooperate with Balkan networks, further complicating regional security dynamics.

In Europe, cocaine remains widely available, with usage levels rising consistently. Europol and European Union Drug Agency reports confirm increasing cocaine purity and consumption, notably driven by Balkan groups‚Äô effective logistical management, ensuring a stable drug flow into key European cities. Cocaine residues in wastewater indicate that usage across Europe continues to rise annually, despite targeted interdictions.

**FUTURE TRENDS AND RISK FACTORS**

While Balkan networks continue to benefit from the fragmentation of Latin American organized crime structures and weak governance, they may face growing threats from regional competitors‚Äîmost notably Mexican and Colombian syndicates vying for control of the lucrative European markets. Additionally, stronger and more established European criminal groups, such as the Italian ‚ÄòNdrangheta, present challenges at the retail and wholesale distribution levels. Further escalation of violence remains a credible risk as territorial and market disputes intensify.

Institutional weaknesses in both Latin America and the Balkans continue to enable Balkan groups to operate largely unimpeded. The increased sophistication of financial schemes and use of legitimate businesses as fronts require heightened vigilance from global financial institutions and customs enforcement. Increasingly robust European and international counter-narcotics initiatives could present strategic operational disruptions, demanding continuous adaptation by these criminal entities.

**A. Continuity Factors**

* **Cocaine production remains high** (\~2,000 tonnes/year), ensuring sustained supply.
* Fragmentation of Colombian guerrilla groups (post-FARC demobilization) opens the field for **new alliances**.
* Weak governance and **endemic corruption** in key transit states (Ecuador, Brazil, Colombia) favor continued entrenchment.

**B. Risks to Balkan Groups**

* **Competition from Mexican cartels** and local actors could escalate violence.
* **European law enforcement coordination** (Europol, EMCDDA) has improved, increasing seizure rates.
* **Retail market volatility**: Other groups (e.g., Italian 'Ndrangheta) may challenge Balkan OCGs‚Äô role in wholesale distribution.

**RECOMMENDED MEASURES FOR COUNTERING THREAT**

Addressing the influence of Balkan criminal networks necessitates comprehensive international cooperation and coordinated action. Enhanced maritime security, including increased container scrutiny and more extensive port inspections, is essential. Emphasis on strengthening judicial and governance capacities in Latin America, particularly in critical transit points like Ecuador, Colombia, and Brazil, would significantly reduce operational freedom for traffickers.

Financial intelligence cooperation should target Balkan-linked legitimate businesses operating as import-export fronts, requiring closer scrutiny and accountability measures in global trade agreements, particularly free trade agreements (FTAs). Leveraging diaspora intelligence networks, especially in Europe, could improve targeting capabilities against key intermediaries and operational nodes.

Robust multinational partnerships modeled after successful U.S.-Latin America initiatives, such as Plan Colombia, would provide training, intelligence sharing, and technical assistance to law enforcement agencies in the Balkans and South America. Joint task forces comprising European Union member states and affected Balkan countries would enhance interdiction effectiveness and weaken established logistical channels used by Balkan criminal groups.

1. **Enhance Port Screening Protocols**
   * Expand randomized cargo inspections in high-risk ports.
   * Integrate container tracking with AI-based anomaly detection.
2. **Strengthen Financial Forensics**
   * Target shell companies and front businesses in import-export trade.
   * Improve cross-border data sharing on beneficial ownership and cash transactions.
3. **Support Governance Reform**
   * Collaborate with Ecuador, Colombia, and Peru to build prosecutorial and customs capacity.
   * Tie FTA compliance to security and anti-corruption benchmarks.
4. **Disrupt Balkan OCG Networks via Diaspora Intelligence**
   * Leverage diaspora communities to map network nodes in Europe and South America.
   * Expand HUMINT and OSINT targeting of known intermediaries and logistics firms.
5. **Promote Strategic Counternarcotics Partnerships**
   * Encourage EU-Balkan joint task forces modeled on U.S.-Colombia Plan framework.
   * Provide training and equipment to Balkan financial and maritime enforcement agencies.

¬†

**CONCLUSION**

Western Balkan organized crime groups have effectively exploited systemic vulnerabilities, geopolitical dynamics, and increasing cocaine production to position themselves as dominant players in transcontinental narcotics trafficking. Their presence within Latin America represents a persistent threat to regional stability, governance, and international security, necessitating targeted, cooperative efforts to diminish their operational capabilities and influence.

Fired up. Coffee poured. Headphones on. *Dawn of the Huntress* had just dropped, and I couldn‚Äôt wait.

This was it.  
The moment I had been waiting for since they announced that elusive Huntress class. Fast, sleek, shadows between shadows ‚Äî a precision predator in a world that had forgotten subtlety.

And now, finally, I was about to face off against Miller ‚Äî the boss so many threads had hinted was more than just a fight. A challenge. A moment. A true rite of passage.

Then‚Ä¶

‚ÄúUnknown object type serialized by server.‚Äù

I can still remember the excitement. Everything was set. It was the dawn of something new, and I was ready to embrace the fast-paced, shadow-dancing, high-flying combat style of the Huntress class. The world was buzzing with players eager to test the waters of this elusive new class, and I was no different. This was the moment to prove myself, to face Miller ‚Äî a boss shrouded in mystery, whispered about in forum threads, and praised as a true test of skill.

But then, as I stepped into the game, my excitement turned into a rude awakening:

""Unknown object type serialized by server.""

What was this? I‚Äôd seen error messages before, but this one‚Ä¶ this one felt different. Something about it felt‚Ä¶ significant. Maybe it was a simple glitch? Perhaps just a technical hiccup, something easily sorted out with a quick restart?

That‚Äôs what I thought at first.

You know what they say about hoping for the best and preparing for the worst? I was prepared for a quick fix. Surely, this would be a minor issue. Maybe a server hiccup, a miscommunication between the game client and the server. It happens, right?

I tried reloading. I tried restarting. I even checked the forums to see if others were having the same issue. Nothing. The message lingered.

**‚ÄúUnknown object type serialized by server.‚Äù**

The more I saw it, the more I thought, *this could be something bigger*. I couldn't help but wonder if there was something deeper, something more intricate going on behind the scenes. Could it be an issue with my local setup? A missing file? A corrupted setting?

Or maybe, just maybe, it‚Äôs a subtle hint that *the solution* is more elusive than any boss fight I‚Äôve ever faced.

I couldn't shake the feeling that the fix was right there, somewhere. I mean, *I had to be close* to figuring it out, right? It couldn't just be a random, unsolvable problem. There‚Äôs always a fix, isn‚Äôt there?

Some suggested that this error might have something to do with server data syncing, while others thought it could be a deeper issue within the game files themselves. A reinstall, a patch, a system tweak ‚Äî the possibilities were endless.

It wasn‚Äôt clear yet, but if I just kept digging, I knew I‚Äôd find it. Some minor adjustment that would clear everything up. It was only a matter of time. After all, this wasn‚Äôt the first time an error like this had cropped up, right? There must be a fix out there somewhere ‚Äî it‚Äôs just about figuring out which one works.

At this point, I began to wonder: what could be causing this error? I dove into troubleshooting like a pro. I tried reinstalling the game, updating my drivers, even clearing my cache. I revisited every setting, rechecked my game configuration, and reloaded my system ‚Äî all in the name of solving the mystery of the ‚ÄúUnknown object type serialized by server.‚Äù

Yet, despite all my efforts, the error persisted. But I knew I was getting closer. I could feel it.

There was something about the way this error repeated itself that felt intentional, like a breadcrumb trail left just for me. It was almost as if the game was *testing* me. And maybe, just maybe, there was a deeper lesson here. Perhaps the solution was right under my nose, and I just had to be patient enough to uncover it.

I started noticing something interesting ‚Äî every now and then, after multiple attempts to load the game, the error would *almost* go away. A flicker of hope. The game would almost let me through. Maybe the server was just behind on syncing, or maybe it was the game‚Äôs data flow that wasn‚Äôt quite aligned yet. It had to be something like that, right?

But then, just as I thought the problem was solved, there it was again ‚Äî **‚ÄúUnknown object type serialized by server.‚Äù**

Maybe the key to solving this issue was something a little more abstract? Perhaps it wasn‚Äôt about tweaking files or restarting the game. Could there be some hidden setting or obscure configuration causing the problem? I couldn‚Äôt help but feel like it was a test ‚Äî a puzzle to be solved, but only if I looked in the right place.

As I scrolled through forums, guides, and other player experiences, one thing became clear: *everyone* had a suggestion for how to fix this, but no one had a guaranteed solution. Some suggested it was related to the server-side data flow, while others insisted it had to do with client-side corruption. Yet none of these led to a definitive fix.

I won‚Äôt claim that I‚Äôve cracked the code, but I *am* pretty sure the fix is right around the corner. It‚Äôs just about finding that elusive tweak ‚Äî the right update, the right change in your configuration, the right patch that might come along with the next update. Who knows, maybe it's something as simple as refreshing your game cache or as complex as a deep dive into hidden game files.

I‚Äôd keep trying. After all, solutions like these never come easily, right? There‚Äôs no magic button to fix things. You‚Äôve got to work for it. And when the fix finally comes, it‚Äôll be that much sweeter.

As I reflect on this experience, I can‚Äôt help but feel like the story is far from over. While the *Dawn of the Huntress* expansion had so much promise, it was marred by this one lingering issue. But that doesn‚Äôt mean the journey is finished.

If anything, I‚Äôm more determined than ever to find that elusive fix. I‚Äôll keep experimenting, trying out new ideas, checking for patches, and maybe even getting deeper into system configurations. The error message may be annoying, but it‚Äôs also a challenge ‚Äî and isn‚Äôt that what gaming is all about?

So, if you‚Äôre reading this and you‚Äôve been hit with the same error, know this: you‚Äôre not alone. The solution is out there, and I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre all getting closer to it with every attempt. Keep trying, keep pushing forward, and maybe, just maybe, the fix will reveal itself when you least expect it.",0,1743809733.0,PathOfExile2,13,0.2,False

25F INTJ here. This is my final attempt, my last mission, to find a husband. I‚Äôve tried putting myself out there in many ways, but each experience feels worse than the last. Reddit is the one place I haven‚Äôt tried yet, so here I am, holding onto one last thread of hope that maybe, just maybe, someone out there is looking for the same depth I am.

So, get comfortable, grab a cup of tea or coffee. This will be a long one.

I‚Äôm 25, female, INTJ, living in a European country. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù (1.73 m), Muslim, and of Middle Eastern background, all things that seem to complicate my chances of finding a good match. Add to that the rarity of being a female INTJ, and here we are.

I‚Äôve tried the usual route, a certain popular Muslim dating app, and while I‚Äôve matched with people who seemed promising, things often ended abruptly, usually with vague discomfort or vanishing acts. I‚Äôve started to feel like I lose a piece of myself every time I connect with someone who isn‚Äôt serious or emotionally present. I give a lot, and getting little in return is slowly wearing down my soul.

Before giving up entirely, I wanted to try Reddit as a final space to see if there are still like-minded people out there who want something real.

So, about me:
1. I‚Äôm pursuing a Master‚Äôs in science (I‚Äôll keep the exact field private for now), and I‚Äôll graduate within a year.
2. I love baking (lately it‚Äôs been my go-to hobby), long walks, and the gym‚Äîyes, I lift weights, and no, I don‚Äôt look manly.
3. I value emotional depth, loyalty, and intellectual conversations. I want to talk about the real stuff, the layered stuff; ideas, feelings, growth.
4. I can be logical and intense, but also deeply loyal, funny, and warm when I feel safe. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôd be perfect if I were a man with this sense of humor, but alas, here I am.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
1. A man who is emotionally and intellectually mature, serious about building a future, and not scared of depth.
2. Someone with a similar level of educational background, ambitious but grounded, someone who can hold space for nuance and connection.
3. I won‚Äôt lie, intellectual chemistry is key. I want to think with you, laugh with you, and build with you. Also, who wouldn‚Äôt want someone to talk about how chickens and dinosaurs are related?! And that the penguins we know are not the real penguins üåù

1jrpywd,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1jrpywd/my_comprehensive_afib_recovery_supplement_stack/,My Comprehensive AFib Recovery Supplement Stack (Cardiac + Autonomic Focus),"This supplement stack was developed during my recovery from persistent AFib and significantly improved my rhythm stability, exercise tolerance, and overall cardiovascular resilience. It may benefit others with similar cardiac or autonomic challenges.

Following a cardioversion after 10 months of persistent AFib and an ejection fraction around 45%, I experienced a marked return in physical capacity. The period I was in AFib overlapped with heavy stimulant and substance use that continued up until shortly before my cardioversion. This added significant and sustained physiological stress to my system, likely contributing to my rhythm instability and reduced cardiac function. Exercise and a mitochondria-supportive diet (inspired by Dr. Raymond Peat‚Äôs principles) have been essential to my recovery.

This guide reflects my personal protocol based on extensive research. Always consult a healthcare provider before replicating or modifying any supplement regimen‚Äîespecially when managing medications or heart conditions.

My supplement stack has two primary goals:

1. Supporting stable heart rhythm, cardiac recovery, and mitochondrial health after experiencing AFib and undergoing cardioversion.
2. Enhancing nervous system resilience and emotional stability, recognizing that chronic stress and anxiety significantly contributed to my AFib.

Below, you'll find clear dosing recommendations, purpose, synergy, and mental health considerations

This stack is the result of personal trial, clinical research, and real-world recovery. Feel free to adapt based on your needs and medical guidance.

# Core Cardiac & Rhythm Stability Supplements

(Supplements in this section are prioritized by foundational impact on rhythm stability, mitochondrial function, and electrolyte balance. Some also contribute meaningfully to mood and nervous system regulation.)

**Magnesium (Glycinate or Taurate)**¬†‚Ä¢ 300‚Äì500mg, 1‚Äì3x/day (\~500‚Äì1000mg total) ‚Ä¢ Stabilizes heart rhythm; reduces palpitations and skipped beats ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Enhances effects when combined with taurine and potassium ‚Ä¢ Caution: May cause loose stools at higher doses; avoid oxide form

# Mental Health & Nervous System Support

(This section focuses on supplements that support emotional balance, neuroprotection, and stress resilience. This part of the stack was especially important in helping me recover from the mental health impact of long-term substance abuse, which overlapped with my period of persistent AFib and left lingering nervous system dysregulation. Several of these also help regulate autonomic tone and may indirectly support heart rhythm stability. While listed here for their mental health benefits, supplements like shilajit, NAC, lysine, and gelatin also contribute to vagal tone, antioxidant status, and systemic inflammation control ‚Äî all of which are relevant to AFib recovery. The blend of antioxidant and amino acid-based support is conservative but strategically chosen.)

**Inositol**¬†‚Ä¢ 12g/day (split into two doses) ‚Ä¢ Reduces anxiety, supports stable mood and sleep quality. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Amplifies calming effects of magnesium, taurine, and L-theanine. ‚Ä¢ Caution: Introduce gradually to minimize gastrointestinal side effects.

**L-Theanine**¬†‚Ä¢ 300‚Äì600mg/day ‚Ä¢ Provides calm focus and reduces sympathetic nervous system activation. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Combines well with caffeine, taurine, and inositol. ‚Ä¢ Caution: Very safe; minimal risk of side effects.

**Phosphatidylserine**¬†‚Ä¢ 100mg in the morning (optional evening dose) ‚Ä¢ Regulates cortisol, enhances cognitive function and emotional stability. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Effective alongside inositol and niacinamide. ‚Ä¢ Caution: May disrupt sleep if taken too late.

**Niacinamide (Vitamin B3)**¬†‚Ä¢ 100‚Äì250mg, 1‚Äì2 times daily with meals (monitor long-term use) ‚Ä¢ Supports NAD+ production, reduces anxiety and neuroinflammation. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Enhances benefits of phosphatidylserine and shilajit. ‚Ä¢ Caution: Avoid confusion with niacin (which causes flushing).

**Lithium Orotate**¬†‚Ä¢ 1‚Äì2mg elemental lithium (5mg orotate form) daily ‚Ä¢ Provides mood stabilization and neuroprotection, beneficial after prolonged stress. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Complements L-theanine and phosphatidylserine. ‚Ä¢ Caution: Avoid combining with prescription lithium.

**Acetyl-L-Carnitine (ALCAR)**¬†‚Ä¢ 500‚Äì1000mg/day (morning or split dose) ‚Ä¢ Mental clarity, dopamine support, and neuronal energy. Also supports cardiac mitochondrial function. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Works with CoQ10, creatine, and PS. ‚Ä¢ Caution: Can be mildly stimulating for some; take earlier in the day.

**Gelatin (Collagen/Glycine)**¬†‚Ä¢ 1 tbsp/day ‚Ä¢ Supports tissue repair, vagal tone, and reduces inflammation. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Works effectively with NAC and inositol.

**N-Acetyl-Cysteine (NAC)**¬†‚Ä¢ 600mg/day (cycle: 3 weeks on, 1 week off) ‚Ä¢ Antioxidant, glutathione precursor, supports detoxification. ‚Ä¢ Synergy: Pairs well with gelatin (glycine) and lysine.

25F INTJ here. This is my final attempt, my last mission, to find a husband. I‚Äôve tried putting myself out there in many ways, but each experience feels worse than the last. Reddit is the one place I haven‚Äôt tried yet, so here I am, holding onto one last thread of hope that maybe, just maybe, someone out there is looking for the same depth I am.

So, get comfortable, grab a cup of tea or coffee. This will be a long one.

I‚Äôm 25, female, INTJ, living in a European country. I‚Äôm 5‚Äô8‚Äù (1.73 m), Muslim, and of Middle Eastern background, all things that seem to complicate my chances of finding a good match. Add to that the rarity of being a female INTJ, and here we are.

I‚Äôve tried the usual route, a certain popular Muslim dating app, and while I‚Äôve matched with people who seemed promising, things often ended abruptly, usually with vague discomfort or vanishing acts. I‚Äôve started to feel like I lose a piece of myself every time I connect with someone who isn‚Äôt serious or emotionally present. I give a lot, and getting little in return is slowly wearing down my soul.

Before giving up entirely, I wanted to try Reddit as a final space to see if there are still like-minded people out there who want something real.

So, about me:
1. I‚Äôm pursuing a Master‚Äôs in science (I‚Äôll keep the exact field private for now), and I‚Äôll graduate within a year.
2. I love baking (lately it‚Äôs been my go-to hobby), long walks, and the gym‚Äîyes, I lift weights, and no, I don‚Äôt look manly.
3. I value emotional depth, loyalty, and intellectual conversations. I want to talk about the real stuff, the layered stuff; ideas, feelings, growth.
4. I can be logical and intense, but also deeply loyal, funny, and warm when I feel safe. I‚Äôve been told I‚Äôd be perfect if I were a man with this sense of humor, but alas, here I am.

What I‚Äôm looking for:
1. A man who is emotionally and intellectually mature, serious about building a future, and not scared of depth.
2. Someone with a similar level of educational background, ambitious but grounded, someone who can hold space for nuance and connection.
3. I won‚Äôt lie, intellectual chemistry is key. I want to think with you, laugh with you, and build with you. Also, who wouldn‚Äôt want someone to talk about how chickens and dinosaurs are related?! And that the penguins we know are not the real penguins üåù
4. As for physical preferences: taller than me and in good shape would be appreciated.

## Key Features Analysis

The best leather laptop backpacks of 2025 incorporate a range of features designed to provide optimal protection, comfort, and institution. Modern designs prioritize not only the safety of your laptop but also the overall user experience, ensuring that you can carry your belongings with ease and confidence.**Premium Leather Construction:** Crafted from full-grain or top-grain leather, these backpacks boast extraordinary durability and a luxurious feel.

The use of high-quality leather ensures that the backpack can withstand daily wear and tear, resisting scratches, scuffs, and other forms of damage. Full-grain leather, in particular, develops a unique patina over time, adding character and enhancing its already sophisticated appearance. The result is a backpack that not only lasts for years but also becomes more beautiful with age.

**Dedicated Laptop Compartment:** A padded compartment designed to securely hold laptops up to 16 inches, providing maximum protection against impacts and shocks.

This dedicated compartment is a crucial feature for any laptop backpack, especially one made from premium leather. The padding within the compartment acts as a cushion, absorbing shocks and minimizing the risk of damage to your laptop during transit. The secure closure, often featuring a Velcro strap or zippered enclosure, prevents the laptop from shifting around inside the backpack.

**Multiple Organizational Pockets:** A variety of internal and external pockets for organizing accessories, documents, and personal items.

These pockets are thoughtfully designed to accommodate a range of items,from smartphones and tablets to charging cables,pens,and water bottles. Internal organizers help keep your belongings neatly arranged, preventing them from getting tangled or damaged. External pockets provide fast access to frequently used items, such as keys, wallets, or travel documents, making it easy to stay organized on the go.

**Ergonomic Design:** Padded shoulder straps and a breathable back panel for enhanced comfort during extended wear.

The ergonomic design distributes weight evenly across your shoulders and back, reducing strain and preventing discomfort. Padded shoulder straps provide cushioning and prevent digging into your skin, while a breathable back panel promotes airflow, keeping you cool and dry even on hot days. Adjustable straps allow you to customize the fit to your body, ensuring optimal comfort and stability.

**Water-Resistant Lining:** A protective lining that safeguards your electronics and belongings from moisture damage.

This water-resistant lining acts as a barrier against spills, rain, and other forms of moisture, preventing water from seeping into the backpack and damaging your valuable electronics. This feature is particularly vital for those who live in areas with frequent rainfall or who often travel with their backpacks in unpredictable weather conditions. The water-resistant lining provides an extra layer of security, ensuring that your laptop and other belongings remain safe and dry.

1jrpnqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1jrpnqy/a_megalist_of_everyday_items_to_use_for_sensory/,A megalist of everyday items to use for sensory seeking,"This is a list of every day objects that can be used for sensory seeking. Intended for people who can't afford/access dedicated fidget toys, or don't want to come out as autistic in public. 

Everyone can enjoy these, not just autistic people. 

**Visual:**

* Mystic quartz: Quartz treated with a surface coating that gives it an iridescent or kaleidoscopic rainbow effect. Because it's based on regular quartz the gems are pretty cheap.

* Fluorite crystals: They look like an aurora or rainbow storm cloud trapped in glass. Very pretty. Colors vary so I recommend buying in person or buying induvial crystals on Ebay so you can pick one that you like.

* Fractal art, optical illusions, MC Escher paintings: Visually stimulating art that you can hang as a regular painting. 

* Dichroic prisms: A dichroic coating is designed to block all but a narrow range of colors. It looks really pretty on a prism. 

* Suncatcher crystals: Trippy kaleidoscope prisms.

* Iridescent film or crystals: Iridescent materials change color depending on the angle of light hitting it. They can be quite pretty.

* UV reactive stuff: You can buy all kinds of items designed to glow under UV light. Combined with some UV LEDs or a blacklight flashlight you can create some trippy effects. Google ""trip cave"" for inspiration. Just don't look directly at a blacklight.

* Aurora lights: Shines a rainbow pattern on the ceiling. 

* Glow in the dark stars: Small dots or stars that can be glued onto the ceiling, creating a sort of night sky in your bedroom. They come in multiple colors.

---

**Auditory:**

* Bubble wrap: Satisfying when popped. Can be found for free in packaging or for very cheap at office supply stores.

* Silicone popping toy: Similar to bubble wrap but reusable.

* Rainsticks: A hollow branch filled with beads. Flipping it around causes the beads fall and bounce around, creating a calming rain-like sound.

* Music: If you find yourself listening to music to recover from stressful situations, you're probably using it as a stim and not just as music.

* Other audio: Stimming to digital audio doesn't necessarily have to mean music. It could also be ASMR, sound effects, relaxing soundscapes, video game sounds, etc.

* Mini waterfall: A tiny waterfall to sit on your desk and create a calm water trickling sound.

---

**Olfactory:**

* Candles, essential oils, perfumes, scented soaps, bath bombs, body sprays, etc: Easy to find in most supermarkets. Come in a million scents. 

* Coffee beans and tea: Also cheap and easy to find. You can smell the right out of the bag, brewing is optional. Coffee beans don't reset nose blindness by the way, that's a myth.

* Cedar wood chips: Meant for smoking meats. Can be purchased in hardware stores. They smell nice when warmed.

* Vick's vaporub, Carmex, lemon scented alcohol wipes: All three have a simple but strong smell and are cheap at stores.

* Vanilla extract: You probably already own some. Give the alcohol a moment to evaporate before smelling it. Also comes in flavors like peppermint, banana and almond. 

* Laundry detergent: If you find a detergent you like the smell of, your clothes become a stim.

* Real plants: Potted plants, sticks from outside, live moss and live herbs can be had for cheap or even free. 

* Aromatherapy necklaces: These house a small vial of essential oils that get slowly released throughout the day. 

---

**Texture:**

* Cloth bags of beads: If you have a cloth/silk dice bag, fill it with smooth items like beads, marbles and dice. Feel them through the fabric. 

* Textured glass: Sometimes I find plates, bottles, or other glass items with interesting textures. Smooth bumps and ridges for example. 

* Faux silk/fur: It can be very soft. If you have a coat or gloves with faux fur you can stroke it in public fairly discreetly. 

* Paint brushes and feathers: Being brushed by soft bristles can be quite pleasurable. If you use real feathers make sure they're clean. 

* Memory foam: *squish squish*. You can buy memory foam animals or just rip a hunk out of an old pillow. 

* Squishmallows: Squishable adorable stuffed animals. 

* Acupressure rings: Spiky rings that can be rolled over the fingers.

* Fabric: Silk, fleece, ribbon, faux fur and microfiber all have interesting textures.

* Putty/slime: Silly putty, slime, putty eraser, nonnewtonian fluid, therapy putty, glue, bread dough, ferrofluid, etc.

---

**Oral:**

* Miswak sticks: Dried stem of a plant that's very tough and fibrous. When chewed it frays into bristles that naturally clean your teeth. Some reviews say it has a strong smell.

* Sugarcane sticks (in moderation): Similar to miswak sticks but made of sugar and therefor delicious. This should be a treat instead since it's literally made of sugar.

* Licorice root (in moderation): Licorice root can be purchased from some specialty health stores or for tea. It's like chewing on a very flavorful stick, more waxy and less crumbly than cinnamon. In high doses it can cause high blood pressure, so don't chew on it every day.

* Himalayan hard cheese: Typically given to dogs as a chew toy, but they make versions for humans too. [Adam Ragusea has a recipe here if you want to make your own](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdvucazJ0kA).

* Biltong, pemmican, snapstix: All three are extremely tough meat jerky that take a long time to chew through.

* Frozen or dehydrated Twizzlers: When they're dry or cold they get very tough.

* Mastic gum: A tough and chewy gum that is generally marketed as a workout for the jaw.

* Teething biscuits: Very dense biscuits meant for helping babies with teething issues. Can be purchased from most stores or made from scratch. Frozen bagels are similar.

---

**Pressure:**

* Weighted blankets: Like being laid on by a heavy cloud.

* Massage hook: A ball on a curved hook used to massage your back muscles.

* Massages: Involves spending money and being around people, but nothing beats a good massage.

* Compression socks: A gentle hug for your feet.

1jrpngj,https://i.redd.it/shga7ro3hwse1.jpeg,Why did baking soda cause organic particulate to settle out in this blended soybean mixture?,"Originally posted in r/chemistry but it was suggested I get opinions here. I extracted Urease enzyme from soybeans by soaking and blending soybeans in distilled water and filtering through coffee filters. The liquid was still cloudy and I wanted to clear it up further. I am a chem noob, and had a theory I could mix in some NaHCO3 baking soda to precipitate out son ions because I know many ionic compounds with carbonate are not soluble, leaving soluble urease in the supernatant, which I could decant. I was surprised to see how well this actually worked, but now I am not sure if it worked for the reasons I thought it might. Why did the addition of baking soda cause all the organic soybean matter to settle? (Left is with baking soda, right is without)   
  
Some of the theories I got in r/chemistry are:  
1. increase of pH from baking soda caused the emulsion to break forcing the organic particles to settle  
2. increase of pH made some things insoluble that were soluble at lower pH  
3. [salting out](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salting_out) with the NaHCO3 caused  proteins to precipitate out due to high ionic strength of the solution  

Any more ideas or intuition to understand this would be so awesome!

Among our circles of friends are Ryan(25m) and Alice (23f). Ryan and my bf have been friends for over a decade, they became friends as teens. I came into the picture when we were all 15/16 and I didn‚Äôt like Ryan too much because his humor was gross and dumb and he would say things like he wanted to watch us make out. It was creepy and I always got the ick from him but he was my boyfriends BEST FRIEND. As the years passed I wanted certain things for my life and he was not passing the vibe check, he was still wanting to do dumb things and take my boyfriend along with him, it was a no for me and I made it pretty clear that I didn‚Äôt want to date a person like that. We were growing up and my boyfriend matured so fast in so many ways. (Cue time jump to where im 20 y/o) My bf and I are expecting a baby girl and had my baby shower and Ryan was invited (he was still single at this point) well he had a tantrum because he wanted to go party and drink the night away and that just wasn‚Äôt for us at that moment. At this point in time Ryan and bf are no longer as close but still friends and that day was an eye opener. We were simply in different stages in our lives and started taking even more space from him. We didn‚Äôt even have a conversation about it, we both just felt it. We still saw him because we had friends in common but nothing like before.(Cue next time jump, about 3 years later) we all have a get together with a mutual friend and I get to talking to Ryan who now has a girlfriend Alice. He was totally different now, he was a hippie pretty much. He‚Äôs a vegetarian, stays away from alcohol and drugs, cares about the environment and had good conversations about spirituality and such. I decided to reconnect at that point because I felt we could all get along now. Which we did honestly, my daughter called them both her aunt and uncle and we got together often, a lot of times without Alice because they didn‚Äôt live together and she has her own schedule. We never did anything big without her , it was usually just be at Ryans house or go eat something together. I truly cared for them like family at this point. I ended up really liking the kind of friend Ryan was for my boyfriend. We would talk often, we got along really well. I noticed that after some time almost every time Ryan would talk to me it was to speak badly of other people who were closest to him. His parents, siblings, girlfriend, friends, literally anyone who was close to him. I would mostly just listen. Then it turned into him talking about women badly, suddenly every woman wanted to have sx with him in his eyes even his own girlfriends mother.. he had fantasies about her and almost all the women he would interact with. I truly don‚Äôt know where all this came from but every time we would see him he would tell us all these sexual things in his mind about all these women. Anything a woman would say to him, he would find a way to sexualize it and believe she wants him. We all would clearly see he was getting the wrong ideas but would just kinda laugh and ignore cause wtf are we supposed to say? He always ended his rants with ‚Äúbut I wouldn‚Äôt cheat, I would leave Alice first‚Äù like okay.. anyways you guys get the deal. In October of last year my bf had to leave for a couple months for work. I got a call from Ryan where he said if I needed anything to let him know which I truly appreciated and asked for a ride to pick something up. This is where he said his first off comment. ‚ÄúI told your boyfriend I will be filling in incase you need anything.. you know anything you need handled I can even handle you lol I even told your bf and he just laughed‚Äù I was so confused cause what? I faked a laugh and said I had to go. I took it as a bad joke and moved on to being grateful we had friends who cared about us. The day came where he gave me a ride and when he picked me up he said I was the 2nd or 3rd girl he picked up in that spot in the last month and people were gonna think he‚Äôs a dog but it‚Äôs innocent. *Confused laugh,moving on* when he goes to drop me back off he asks me something about my hair and I said oh I might dye it a certain way again. He cut me off and said ‚Äúyeah and put on some fishnets in a lil outfit‚Äù all with a weird grin. I stop talking and im like what?? Why was that so specific?? He said don‚Äôt tell your boyfriend but I SAW A SPICY VIDEO OF YOU. He said it like it was nothing. I was in shock I didn‚Äôt know what to say. He said something like ‚Äúnoo don‚Äôt worry don‚Äôt get embarrassed you looked sexy‚Äù WHAT??? I was so freaking shocked I couldn‚Äôt think straight. I was also a victim of SA before so when men make me uncomfortable like that I try to politely exit and that‚Äôs what I did. Thank goodness he said it right when he was dropping me off. On the inside I was shaking, I couldn‚Äôt breathe, I wanted to cry. He told me one time him and my bf were drinking and he asked to see a video of me and said he showed my bf one of his gf. So there I was at home with my daughter and my bf was hundreds of miles away. I decided to wait until he came home to confront him. When he came back home I didn‚Äôt actually confront him, I had enough time to think about it all and decided to ask related questions randomly like ‚Äúwould you ever be ok with me showing my friends our spicy tapes? If someone had to see me naked who would it be? Have you ever shown anyone our private album?‚Äù All spread out randomly so there was no suspicion. My bf is the sweetest kindest soul I have ever personally met. He respects women, he protects them, he is in general such a good person. Raised by a religious mom and has 2 little sisters he absolutely adores all the women in his life. It was unbelievable to me that he would ever show people our intimate videos or seek out looking at a friend like that. He didn‚Äôt admit anything, for the next 3 months I was just looking for signs of anything weird I was even checking his phone and nothing. I stopped seeing Ryan all together, only my bf would go over. I felt stuck because they had become best friends again and Ryan had never actually made advances towards me. Just told me on repeated occasions that I had a nice body or was attractive and he also has said those things casually in conversation to my boyfriend about me but in a way that seemed almost innocent, it was weird and im mad now that we never said anything . Obviously it was more uncomfortable when it was just us two talking but I never added to those conversations plus after so many years of friendship I would never ever think of him that way and never have so I thought maybe he was really just dumb and didn‚Äôt know what he should keep to himself but meant no harm. He has repeatedly admitted to checking me out and even said he got called out on it once and denied it but then said obviously he looks at my booty cause everyone looks, its human nature to be attracted to others. One day my bf came home from hanging with the boys and looked off and I asked about it. He said he was getting really annoyed of hanging out with Ryan cause all he wanted to do was talk about women and sexual things and how he tests the waters with his clients, insurance lady, girlfriends mom etc and they all would be down bla bla bla some explicit stuff I dont wanna say, you get the jist of it. My bf said he just wants to hang out, play video games or go biking, drink some beers, anything fun but its been the same thing lately and it‚Äôs uncomfortable and annoying. This is where I start telling him how Ryan has the same convos with me and yes its all gross and wrong and not only that but I explained to him the comments he has made about me and I dropped the bomb about me knowing about the time he showed him a video of me and how that probably only fueled him to being more inappropriate because in his head my boyfriend would be okay with me sleeping with him if I wanted to. YES those were Ryans words. Those are the kind of things he would say and then move on from like its nothing, never giving me time to process on the spot or respond correctly and that is once again because creepy men throw me into survival mode. The reason it took me so many months to say anything was because I was trying to figure out if my bf was as disgusting as Ryan because leaving him would be very impactful on so many people mostly our daughter. So before confrontation I have kind of been watching him more carefully and waiting for moments where he might show true colors. My relationship is not the point of this post although yes it is something I have been working on since October and I still don‚Äôt know where we will end up. My bf is a great person but I feel very disappointed in him and disrespected. Well my bf and I have been zero contact with Ryan despite all his desperate attempts of reaching out and his long messages. My bf has not even talked to him about any of this. Ryan decided to start a friendship with two close friends of mine, they‚Äôre a couple and are not aware of any of the problems we have. They just know because of Ryan that we dont talk to him anymore. I truly dont care who he is friends with but guess what, he has also spoken badly of them saying they are both interested in him in a spicy way (they are a gay couple) I didn‚Äôt think to mention it honestly I just want him away and busy with others at this point. Well I met up with one of them for coffee one day and he asked me about Ryan and if we were still friends. I said no just because a few things he has told me made me uncomfortable, I didn‚Äôt really want to start any drama by telling him everything . He proceeds to tell me that Ryan has been telling them that I want him and that he feels bad for my boyfriend, that I even said one time infront of my bf that Ryan is a true man unlike him and he looks so manly in his new truck while side eyeing my bf. Who the heck says that first of all?? Also why would I think a drug dealing hippie who lives with his parents, speaks disgustingly about women and has nothing going for himself is more of a man than my bf who has been working hard since high school to give us everything, spoils us with things and with time, has never had me questioning his intentions or his love for me, is the father to our daughter that I wish I had. This man built a freaking bathroom in my moms home with zero experience. He‚Äôs always there for close ones, he can fix anything literally anything. He‚Äôs that one person playing with all the kids for fun when we are at fam parties because he wants to. This might all seem random but he‚Äôs the biggest problem solving family man who gets things resolved and btw HE‚ÄôS HOT. My point is there is no way I would ever be the slightest attracted to Ryan or disrespect my bf the way he says I did and I mean my friend didn‚Äôt really believe it because he knows all of us individually, has spent time with us all 1 on 1 and anyone who knows Ryan would know he‚Äôs delulu. I am a little disappointed that they are keeping their friendship with him despite knowing all of this because he‚Äôs been super disrespectful to us for no reason. Right now im debating having a conversation with Alice because 1 she deserves to know someone saw her spicy pics or video I really never asked what exactly was shown of her because I don‚Äôt really want to know, the whole thing is gross to me. Should I tell her how he fantasizes about her mom and their friends and customers? I also know they broke up for a few days recently and him and a friend went to go pick up some girls and were drinking and twerking in his truck lol he was showing it off to my friends they were sending me the audios live as they were talking.. but i mean they were broken up? Its just not fair that he‚Äôs the weirdo and he‚Äôs coming into my circles and trying to make us look bad. Idk with how many other people he‚Äôs done the same but im glad these friends told me. This is messy and probably missing so much context but I needed to get this out at some point. I wanna meet her for coffee and talk. She absolutely loves Ryan we can all see it. He says she‚Äôs crazy, invasive, insecure, and very emotionally dependent on him and so many more things I really don‚Äôt believe. She also has no reason to believe me so I also thought about dropping it but he‚Äôs affecting my life and has zero consequences for his actions.

1jrpeb3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1jrpeb3/they_lied_about_what_happened_in_oak_river_part_1/,They Lied About What Happened in Oak River - Part 1,"As far as the United States government is concerned, I have been legally dead as of October, 2010. I am among the many killed in the ‚Äòwild fire‚Äô that spread across the town of Oak River, North Carolina. At least, that was what the official reports had claimed once the dust had settled. Due to a recent diagnosis, I feel like I don‚Äôt have a reason to keep what really happened to myself anymore. Despite all they‚Äôve done to cover it up, as a final ‚Äòfuck you‚Äô to the powers that be, I‚Äôd like to tell those on this forum what really happened to my hometown that wiped it off the maps.

‚Äì¬†¬†

Oak River was a small town in Western North Carolina, boasting an impressive population of 215. A hold over from a bygone era of America that was slowly losing its reason to exist as society itself modernized. Much like my dad before me, and his dad before him, I was inducted into the local police department. Well, ‚Äòdepartment‚Äô is a generous word to describe what we had going on. It was more like what hall monitors are in elementary school. It‚Äôs a fancy badge that says you get to dictate the rules, if anyone really chooses to listen. But, much like with hall monitoring, there wasn‚Äôt anything worth enforcing. From what I can remember, nothing much strayed away from the usual drunk at the local bar, a domestic dispute (mostly from the Hendersons‚Äô household), or a speeding ticket. Even then, there were barely enough people on the road for it to matter, and it was mostly a scolding toward the local high schoolers who had just been granted the right to drive their hand-me-down pickup truck that still operated via stick shift; the familial chariot.¬†

Down at the station, it was just the four of us. Sheriff Audrey Becker and her three bumbling deputies: me, Ben, and Lauren. I was freshly twenty-two, and had just recently stepped into the role following my dad‚Äôs passing the previous year from lung cancer. I felt unequipped to fill the shoes left behind, as every interaction I had was somehow followed by a callback to him and how much people liked him. He was a man who never knew the concept of a frown, and would fit a corny joke into any conversation, followed by a bellowing laugh and a clench of his beer belly. If he had grown his facial hair out past his mustache, I‚Äôd think he was a younger Santa Claus.¬†

‚ÄúJunior!‚Äù exclaimed a man‚Äôs voice from behind me, followed by a hard grasp of his calloused palm on my left shoulder which shook my frame. I jolted in surprise, nearly spilling the freshly poured coffee from the styrofoam cup in my hands.¬†

I turned, groggily, to face Ben, one of the aforementioned deputies, who grinned with a wide, cheeky smile. He towered over me, his robust features recognizable even in the corner of my blurred vision. Ben chuckled to himself and ran his hand over his short, coarse hair, as he sat down at the tiny round table in the break room.¬†

I couldn‚Äôt help but crack a small smile despite his routine of bothering you just enough to get on your nerves, but not piss you off. It was an art form for him, boiled down to a social science. I could really best describe Ben as the older brother whose sole purpose on this Earth was to pick on you endearingly, because it‚Äôs not like anyone could do a thing to stop him.¬†

‚ÄúEnjoying early shift? Or would you say late? Where does that fall on the clock for you?‚Äù He joked.

I turned, raising the coffee gently to my lips as I attempted to indulge in the sweet boost of caffeine while the boiling hot liquid threatened to scald my tongue.¬†

‚ÄúFuck this, man.‚Äù I mumbled. We both chuckled. ‚ÄúPassed twelve, it just dies. By that time, the bar is closed and every geezer is fast asleep anyways.‚Äù

Ben shrugged. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt say I love it or hate it. But every so often, some wild shit gets called in. Did I ever tell you about that one time we caught some guy from the next town over who was breaking into Mrs. Brown‚Äôs house high as shit on PCP? We caught the fucker, buck ass naked, with his face in the dog food bowl in her kitchen-‚Äù

The sound of a landline ringing from the adjacent room down the hall cut Ben off from his story. He scrunched his face, craning his neck to look toward the door. I turned as well, a brow raised. Ben stood from his chair and huffed, making his way out of the break room and toward the source of the call.¬†

The next thing I knew, we were both on the road, speeding toward the source of the call. Sirens blaring as we rounded the sharp turns of the rural woodland roads.¬†

‚ÄúJesus,‚Äù I mumbled, my eyes nervously darting back and forth from the passenger side window to my clammy hands in my lap. ‚ÄúShould we call Ms. Becker?‚Äù¬†

Ben pursed his lips, gripping the steering wheel tighter.¬†

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs‚Äì‚Äù he stopped to think over his wording ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see how it is when we get there. See it first. Then we can call Sheriff.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAren‚Äôt the Buckleys gun freaks? Like, how‚Äì‚Äù I stammered

‚ÄúMan, I don‚Äôt know. Dispatch wasn‚Äôt even clear on the full thing. I don‚Äôt think their daughter was coherent enough, I think that‚Äôs the problem.‚Äù The confidence in Ben‚Äôs voice wavered.¬†

It wasn‚Äôt long before the squad car pulled off the main road and rumbled up the gravel and dirt path, the sudden incline jolting the old vehicle. Aside from the light coming from our car, the Buckleys‚Äô property was blanketed in a haze of thick darkness. The forest of pine trees made the drive feel claustrophobic, all packed together on the property, pushed tightly against the edge of the road.¬†

‚ÄúScrew you for jinxing this.‚Äù Ben said, breaking the silence, doing his best to lift the heavy weight of anxiety with the toothpick of a joke. I shook my head, turning to reply, but was cut short.¬†

I nearly jumped from my skin in fright as the headlights suddenly illuminated the screaming and crying Jessica Buckley stumbling down the dirt road, nearly tripping and falling over as she waved her hands frantically over her head.¬†

‚ÄúJesus Christ!‚Äù Ben shouted, slamming on the breaks of the squad car as we came within a few meters of the terrified teenager, her face covered in tears, her eyes puffy.

Ben and I both exited the vehicle as fast as our limbs would respond to our brains.¬†

Jessica stumbled, finally caving to exhaustion as her hands moved to her face.¬†

‚ÄúHelp! Help, please!‚Äù Her words were choppy and drawn out as she mustered what she could through fainted breath and heavy emotions. This was our caller, I now understood why details were limited. Ben rushed forward, one hand on his service weapon out of sheer instinct. He looked around toward the treeline before kneeling down to the terrified girl and reaching out a hand for comfort.¬†

‚ÄúMa‚Äôam, what happened? Are you hurt?‚Äù He asked, trying his best to remain calm. Jessica lunged and held onto him with what little strength she had left, crying into his shoulder, heaving to catch her breath through the sobs.¬†

I stood, frozen, watching this unfold before me. I knew I was supposed to be prepared for this, it was my job. But this *never* happened out here. If only I had known the hell we would walk into up that hill on the Buckley property. Something I don‚Äôt think Oak River had ever experienced prior.¬†

Ben and I moved the nearly inconsolable Jessica into the squad car, her arms outstretched to the door as she clambered into the safety of the vehicle as fast as she could. She did all she could to catch her breath as we too made our way back inside. We both turned to look at her.

‚ÄúMiss Buckley, can you tell us what happened?‚Äù Ben asked. Jessica stammered as she struggled to form any further words, crumbling into the back seat.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, we‚Äôve got you.‚Äù I added, desperately reaching for words of reassurance. She shook her head shakily, swatting the long strands of blonde hair that kept falling in front of her face.¬†

Ben turned to face me. ‚ÄúWe gotta head up to the house‚Äì‚Äù

‚ÄúNo! No!‚Äù Jessica suddenly sat upright, pleading. We both looked back toward her, struck with confusion.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt!‚Äù She heaved, catching her breath once more. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go back up there, please!‚Äù

‚ÄúMiss, I know you‚Äôre scared. I know, but we‚Äôre here. We gotta go up there.‚Äù Ben placed his hand back on the steering wheel.¬†

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù She shrieked, starting to slam her palm on the divide between us and her. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôll die! We‚Äôll die!‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúGod damnit.‚Äù Ben mumbled under his breath.

‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs okay! Nothing is gonna happen to you. I know you‚Äôre scared.‚Äù I tried again to calm her, knowing how robotic I likely sounded.¬†

‚ÄúShut up! No!‚Äù Jessica broke down into a fountain of tears, her mouth agape as she wailed in terror.¬†

I looked toward Ben, he had turned to face the road, slowly accelerating the vehicle once again.¬†

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt fuckin‚Äô leave.‚Äù¬†

We both felt a wave of unease washing over us. The squad car made its way up the path, rumbling as it traversed over the unpaved road.¬†

Jessica continued to panic. The closer we got to the house, the more she grew desperate. Her slams on the divide mixed with pleas of unadulterated terror filled the vehicle.¬†

‚ÄúStop! Stop! Turn Around! Please! Please!‚Äù Her cries were drawn out, interrupted by the occasional hiccup caused by the excessive sobbing. ‚ÄúLet me out!‚Äù¬†

Jessica slammed her foot on the locked rear door with the distress of a cornered animal. Anything at this point to avoid reaching that house. I had no idea what to do or say, and I could tell that Ben was struggling to keep his composure. A moment later, the path came to an end. The front porch‚Äôs motion sensor light illuminated the area as the car crept to a halt.¬†

Ben and I did our best to assess the scene at face value from the safety of our vehicle, looking toward the areas that were basked in the headlights or porch light. The front door of the house hung by a single hinge, battered, revealing the black void of the house‚Äôs interior. Then, both Ben and I saw it. A sign of things to come.

A wooden dog house sat by the door. Connected to it was the metal chain usually used to hold the collar of a large dog to the dog house itself. As my eyes followed the snaking chain along the grass, they landed at a large, unmoving lump. I couldn‚Äôt get a detailed look due to the lighting, but my stomach was sinking further the more I scanned the area.¬†

‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù Ben squinted, reaching for the door handle. ‚ÄúJunior, gun.‚Äù¬†

I nodded. As we both went to exit the vehicle, Jessica shot upwards, unleashing another shriek.¬†

‚ÄúNo! No! It‚Äôs still here! Don‚Äôt leave me here! Please!‚Äù She sobbed, pounding the back of our seats with her palm.

Ben turned back, one leg already out of the car by this point.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, you‚Äôre safe. Not gonna let anything happen, okay sweetheart?‚Äù Ben‚Äôs voice was as reassuring as he could make it, but I could hear the cracks. He turned to me, a stern look now plastering his face.¬†

‚ÄúGet on the radio, we need backup. Gonna need EMTs here too.‚Äù He ordered.¬†

I was too hung up on Jessica's words. I knew they were the ramblings of someone utterly distraught, but ‚Äòit‚Äô? My mind clung to the word, it stood out like a sore thumb. I tried to run through reasons as to why she would‚Äì

‚ÄúJackson!‚Äù Ben hissed, patting me roughly on my shoulder, snapping me from my trance.¬†

I nodded, fumbling for the radio. Before I pressed the button to talk, I reached out to Ben.¬†

‚ÄúHey, wait.‚Äù I said, keeping my eyes fixed dead ahead on the house. Ben stopped, his hand back on his holstered service weapon.¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can‚Äôt both go in there and leave her in the car. Not when we don‚Äôt know who‚Äôs here.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, well I‚Äôm not going in alone for the same fucking reason.‚Äù Ben muttered.¬†

‚ÄúWe announce ourselves first. Say we‚Äôre armed.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúBrother, I‚Äôm not gonna waste time if people in there need first aid. We‚Äôre going now.‚Äù Ben took a further step out of the car.

Jessica whimpered from the back seat, tears still streaming down her cheeks.¬†

‚ÄúNo! There‚Äôs‚Äì‚Äù She took a quick inhale, fighting off her tears. ‚ÄúWe gotta go! They‚Äôre dead! It‚Äôll come back!‚Äù her glassy eyes darted back and forth from me to Ben, pleading with us for the hundredth time.¬†

Ben leaned back into the car. ‚Äú*What* happened? Gotta tell me. Gotta tell us.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äì I came home and they were‚Äì‚Äù Jessica‚Äôs eyes darted past us and out the front windshield, followed by a shriek that made both Ben and I jump. She recoiled back into the seat and her eyes bulged from their sockets.¬†

Ben and I spun around to face the house once again, seeing a figure dart back through the threshold of the front door. By the time we had seen it, most of it was already inside. I didn‚Äôt know if Ben realized the same thing, but whoever, or *whatever* it was, was *big*.¬†

‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù shouted Ben, drawing his weapon and aiming it toward the house. He smacked the side of the car to get my attention. ‚ÄúCall in!‚Äù¬†

I nodded shakily and grasped the radio in my sweaty palm, speaking into the microphone with as stoic of a tone that I could muster. We needed the Sheriff at the very least. I prayed that backup would be on its way soon.

‚ÄúOak River Police Department! Come out with your hands where I can see them!‚Äù Ben bellowed, keeping his firearm‚Äôs aim on the front door. All remained quiet except for the chirp of the midnight insects and the cruiser‚Äôs engine.¬†

As I finished my call to dispatch, I carefully and hesitantly opened my passenger side door. I too reached for my service weapon, but couldn‚Äôt bring myself to draw it from the confines of its holster just yet. A debilitating weight of fear clung to me, holding me from moving my arm.¬†

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt go in there!‚Äù Jessica pleaded from inside the car. I knew that by this point. My blood had run cold and nothing could persuade me to enter that house. Triple homicide in this town? If I were to believe Jessica, which I was very much inclined to, her parents and brother were long dead inside that house. Why the hell did she continue to say ‚Äòit‚Äô? Delirium? I wanted to believe so.¬†

‚ÄúCome out! Show me your hands! We‚Äôre armed!‚Äù Ben announced once again, maintaining his stance from behind his open door. We all sat by that car for what felt like an eternity. I could only imagine the shit we would get for not going inside and not securing the situation, but more and more I felt like if we did head inside, we would end up just like the Buckleys.¬†

Ben grunted in frustration, moving out from behind the relative safety of the driver‚Äôs side door and hesitantly beginning to approach the house. His boots crunching along the patchy grass loudly despite his best efforts.¬†

As he was only a few steps in, a loud slam erupted from the back of the house, echoing through the night, causing Ben to stop where he stood as it caught him off guard. The screech of old hinges signaled that the back door had been thrown open, followed by the rustling of someone rushing out into the woods. Dried foliage crackled under the quickly paced footsteps as the home‚Äôs invader seemingly fled into the foliage out through the back of the Buckley home.¬†

Ben recomposed himself and motioned to me with one hand. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go!‚Äù¬†

I shook myself from my trance of fear, drawing my firearm at long last and stepping out of the vehicle‚Äôs safe embrace. I needed to do my job, I needed to get my bearings straight despite all the instinctual alarms going off in my brain. Part of me wanted to stall for every second I could to wait for backup. As I advanced, I stumbled at first, but eventually adopted a more confident footing as I made my way across the yard to join Ben, who took the lead.¬†

Our first pit stop right before entering the house of horrors brought us within clear view of our first sight of carnage.¬†

The Buckleys owned an English Mastiff, a dog that had scared the hell out of me on multiple occasions when I had been at the home before for far less distressing reasons. The beast of a pet weighed probably as much as I did. It was the ultimate deterrent from stepping foot on their property aside from the arsenal of firearms that everyone knew Mr. Buckley kept inside the walls of his abode. Hence why my heart sank as we approached ‚ÄòGreg‚Äô, or what was left.¬†

My legs locked in place as I staggered to a halt a few feet from the viscera, small trails of steam still rising from the shredded lump of canine flesh in the cold autumn air. I stared, blankly, unaware of how to process what I saw. The animal had been parted in two, unceremoniously; torn unevenly. Innards poured out onto the grass. Ben‚Äôs shaky breath beside me indicated that we both came to grasp a fraction of what lay ahead.¬†

‚ÄúOh‚Äì Oh shit‚Äì I‚Ä¶‚Äù Ben couldn‚Äôt find the words. I was amazed he even attempted. We both wrestled to shift our gaze toward the front door, heartbeats racing at their capacity.¬†

As though my prayers had been answered, the distant sound of a squad car‚Äôs siren called out through the night down the dirt road. The lights punctured through the dense trees in small pinpoints. Sheriff Becker had arrived.¬†

1jrpdz2,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1jrpdz2/after_4_years_of_chronic_severe_constipation_im/,"After 4 years of chronic, severe constipation‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm cured.","Strap in y‚Äôall, it‚Äôs a story!

I developed a very sudden, life-altering case of chronic constipation 4 years ago as an otherwise very healthy, relatively active 23F. I had never had issues with gut motility before in my life. 

I didn‚Äôt even notice at first that my bowel movement frequency slowed drastically out of nowhere - it was the hemorrhoids that caught my attention. I‚Äôd had them a couple times before, so I treated them as normal with some Prep H. I was working a really fast-paced job at the time so I attributed it to the stress. But after a couple of months, I realized the hemorrhoids weren‚Äôt going anywhere because my stools were always so hard and I was constantly straining. 

The first thing I did was start drinking 2+ liters of water per day, which made no difference. My mom suggested milk of magnesia (which I very quickly realized is NOT meant for long-term use) which softened my stools but after a few weeks of daily use I experienced some insane side effects. I stopped using it and my stools instantly went back to feeling like knives again. 

It was around this time the hemorrhoids started turning into anal fissures. I panicked seeing increasing amounts of blood after every bowel movement and the pain was absolutely *blinding.* I saw a doctor who recommended Miralax - which I would then become dependent on entirely for the next 3.5 years. 

Over the course of the next year or so I started doing heavy research into gut motility and doing everything possible to get things moving. I started eating way healthier, incorporating more veggies, flax seeds, etc. into my diet (though I wasn‚Äôt eating all that bad to begin with) and exercising 3-5x a week. No changes. I completely gave up all stimulants like coffee/energy drinks and even Adderall and started taking fiber supplements and magnesium. No changes. Over the years I‚Äôve tried various elimination diets like cutting out dairy and gluten. I even got off birth control because I‚Äôd read that can cause constipation. Nothing worked. 

I saw several doctors and had thousands of dollars worth of blood tests done to check my blood sugar, thyroid, vitamin levels, hormone levels, etc. everything under the sun. All normal. Every GP I saw told me the same thing: ‚ÄúJust keep drinking water and taking Miralax.‚Äù I saw a GI specialist and she recommended a colonoscopy, but I had to decline - she told me I‚Äôd have to stop taking Miralax a few days before the procedure and I told her I couldn‚Äôt do that because it would take me *weeks* to recover. (Miralax works relatively slowly so any time I‚Äôd miss a dose or stop taking it, my digestion would come to a screeching halt. I‚Äôd go 3-5 days without a BM, causing me to shit knives and rip open my fissures all over again.) 

As you can imagine, this began taking a severe mental toll on me. I lived in constant fear of using the bathroom. Even when I stayed on top of my Miralax doses, there were times it would just randomly stop working, I‚Äôd go a few days without a BM and bust my fissure scars open and the cycle would repeat. The longest I went without a bowel movement was 12 days, which landed me in the hospital‚Ä¶ I hadn‚Äôt missed a single dose and was living an extraordinarily healthy lifestyle by that point. Nothing I did made any difference. 

At some point around the 3 year mark, my fissures turned into a perianal abscess, which eventually turned into a fistula. The abscess would resurface randomly every 2-3 months, and I‚Äôd be bedridden in unbearable pain for days, sometimes weeks at a time until the infection passed. Because the fistula was in my perineum, it completely decimated my vaginal health and I experienced constant, severe BV infections. I was in a long-term relationship at the time and my sex life was ruined. I heavily considered taking my life at this point. 

I say all of this in case there is someone else out there suffering the way I have. You are not alone. I wouldn‚Äôt wish this experience on my worst fucking enemy. 

Now, I am by no means a medical expert (though I have done *exorbitant* amounts of research over the last 4 years), and this MAY OR MAY NOT be the thing that works for you. But I‚Äôm ecstatic to report that I finally found what works for me. 

I came across a podcast with a guest named Dr. Will Bulsiewicz and he was talking about the benefits of a whole foods, plant-based (WFPB) diet. Veganism had never appealed to me but his explanation of the whole-foods part made a lot of sense. (I won‚Äôt go into too much detail, but if you‚Äôre interested, he wrote a book called Fiber Fueled and it‚Äôs fascinating and very informative). His whole spiel resonated with me and I would‚Äôve literally tried anything at that point. I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot for a month or so and see what happens. 

Ladies and gentlemen‚Ä¶ 4 years of constipation were reversed in LESS THAN A WEEK. I weaned myself off the Miralax and within a WEEK I was going 2-3 times a day - blissfully soft, bulky stools. I was in disbelief at first and had to give it some time before I got my hopes up. But it‚Äôs been an about a month now and I‚Äôm not only still going 1-2x per day, I‚Äôm having the best shits of my life. I actually cried tears of joy on the toilet the other day because I‚Äôd forgotten what it felt like to poop normally without the help of laxatives. It‚Äôs a completely different experience. And all I had to do was switch to eating plants. It almost feels silly that the answer was so simple all along. 

Like I said, this may or may not work for the next person, I‚Äôm just sharing my experience in case someone out there is going crazy looking for the next solution to try. I‚Äôm open to any kinds of questions or if anyone is in a similar situation I‚Äôm here to provide any resources I can or even just moral support. 

Thanks for reading. Much love. 

TLDR; As a healthy 27yr old I was chronically constipated for over 4 years - nothing I did worked until I started eating whole foods plants based (WFPB). Now I‚Äôm more regular than I‚Äôve ever been. ",10,1743808019.0,Constipation,4,0.92,False

I started being fairly active at the start of February, weightlifting 3 times a day, and playing soccer every week as well as walking regularly and running 1-2 times a week.I was trying to lose weight before but wasn't too serious about it, but after a while I wanted to become serious and decided to start counting my calories which also means I'm new to this whole thing. I used a formula I found from a YT Short, and according to that formula, myTDEE is 2948, I also used https://tdeecalculator.net/ and it says my TDEE and it says my TDEE is 2687. I downloaded Cronometer to track my calories and it set my target at 1900 calorie intake.

Since I'm currently in college I don't really have a lot of options in terms of food, I eat in the cafeteria, only breakfast and lunch/dinner though. Normally I eat a breakfast wrap (tortilla wrap with eggs, ham bits, sausage bits, and melted yellow cheese) and a coffee, and for lunch/dinner a grilled chicken salad (lettuce, 1-2 hard boiled eggs, baby tomatoes, and sliced grilled chicken) or a plain burger with lettuce and tomato, along with 0 fat Greek yogurt, every day. My water intake is also pretty decent, I usually drink 4-6 20oz bottles of water a day. On weekends I usually let myself ""binge"", which is just me adding ketchup to my burger, and getting a bottle of juice instead of water, or ordering chicken tenders for lunch/dinner.

Since calculating my TDEE and calorie deficit goal of only eating 1800 calories a day, I calculated my regular diet, and turns out I'm only eating about 1k calories a day, which sound good on paper, but I've had this diet since the start of February so it stands to reason that I've been eating at deficit before starting to count my calories.

My question is what do I do if anything at all, should I keep my current diet or let myself eat more? For added context I started eating only two times a day during my 2nd year of highschool, skipping lunch. So maybe this resulted in my calculated TDEE being wrong since my body has already grown accustomed to only eating twice a day.

About a week and a half ago, I matched with this girl on tinder. We chatted for a bit and totally hit it off and met up for coffee a couple of days ago. We even made tentative plans to go out again after finals. However, while I was walking around campus yesterday, I saw her with some guy, and they were kissing and acting pretty couple-y.

Now I'm stuck wondering if I should approach him and let him know that his girlfriend is on tinder, or if I should just mind my own business and unmatch her. A part of me feels like I could prevent someone from getting hurt, but another part thinks it‚Äôs not my place to intervene.

Any advice on what I should do?

EDIT: I attend a pretty small university so it‚Äôs not hard to get info about people. A friend of mine is friends with a friend of the boyfriend and I got confirmation that they‚Äôve been dating for about 3 months.¬†",1,1743807872.0,Advice,7,0.67,False

üí∞ $1300/month | 2 bed, 2 bath | August 2025 ‚Äì July 2026

Hi! I‚Äôm Madelyn ‚Äî I‚Äôm transferring to UGA in the fall as a junior
majoring in advertising, and I‚Äôm looking for a female roommate to
share a beautiful apartment at The Mathis.

The apartment is a 2 bed, 2 bath on the first floor with high
ceilings, great natural light, and a modern, open feel. It‚Äôs
unfurnished, so there‚Äôs plenty of room to make it our own. It‚Äôs
walking distance to campus and close to restaurants, coffee shops, and
everything else you‚Äôd want nearby. Utilities are included except for
electric, and parking is included.

A little about me: I love thrifting, cooking, spending time outside,
listening to music, checking out fun places to eat, and hanging out at
coffee shops. I‚Äôm also bringing my cat (she‚Äôs sweet and super chill).
I‚Äôm hoping to find someone
 who‚Äôs clean, easygoing, and wants to help
make the apartment feel like home.

Let me know if you‚Äôre interested or want to talk more! ",1,1743807850.0,UGAHousing,0,1.0,False
