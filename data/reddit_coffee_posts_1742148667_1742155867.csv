1jcu1dn,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1jcu1dn/seeking_coffee_platform_feedback/,Seeking Coffee Platform Feedback,"Hi fellow home baristas ☕,

I'm excited to share something I've been working on—**Respect the Beans** (RTB), a platform built for people like us who are passionate about discovering great coffee and sharing our experiences. RTB includes a growing list of **1,800+ roasters and 35,000+ coffees**, making it easy to find your next favorite bean. With RTB, you can log coffees as reviews, share your profile (including coffee preferences, logged coffees, and wishlist), and see what others think about different coffees through their reviews. It's a **community-driven space** where we can swap brewing tips, log our coffee journeys, and explore new flavors together.

This all started from my own obsession with coffee and wanting a dedicated place to explore, capture, and share my own coffee journey. I'd love for you to check it out and help shape RTB's future together. Your feedback will directly influence which features I prioritize and how the platform evolves. If you enjoy geeking out over coffee, finding unique roasters, or just sharing your love for a good cup, your input is invaluable. Give it a look, share your thoughts, and let's collaborate to build the coffee community we've always wanted—one that truly respects the beans!

Please note that I am still in the early stages of RTB, making final enhancements and fixing a few minor bugs. 😁

1jctzne,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jctzne/aio_my_mums_bf_took_my_nintendo_switch_since_i/,AIO my mum's bf took my nintendo switch since I didn't want him to use my cup?,"Title is very oversimplified.

My mum's boyfriend who I'll call 'Craig' has been dating my mum for 5 year since New year 2020 for some background info. He hasn't proposed or even saved money for a ring yet. They have a 2 year old kid, my half sister. I'm the oldest (17f) and I have a younger full sibling (14m).

So, I have this very rare nightmare before christmas themed cup. I got it as a Christmas present in 2018 when I was majorly obsessed with the movie. You can't get this cup new anymore, and it's a very big mug, twice the size of any normal mug that we have in the house. Craig always uses it to have tea or coffee. 

Craig has only seen the film once and didn't really care for it. (Neither like nor dislike) he just uses it because of the size and doesn't care that it's mine that I got way before we even met him. 

This upsests me as it's my favourite, and whenever I go to make a coffee / use it, it's always dirty in the sink or dishwasher. I very rarely get to use it if I have time to make one in the mornings since the dishwasher would have been on overnight, or I have to spend time cleaning it for ages knowing his lips or tea stains (I hate tea) have been all over it which grosses me out. It was limited edition too so I can't buy another. 

The other morning, I has just come downstairs on the weekend when Craig doesn't work. I was sat on the carpet with the dog stroking her when I heard my little sister say ""here's your cup daddy"" I looked up and saw Craig taking my nightmare before christmas mug off her and saying ""thank you"" I looked back down stroking the dog again and said ""well it's my cup haha"" (since she had said it was his.) As Craig walked away he said ""no it's my cup. It's my manly cup."" It sounds like he's joking or being sarcastic but he seriously said that as he walked out the room with it. I also wanna mention he is a massive Trump supporter if that gives people an idea of him. 

Anyway as he walked out the room I said ""I'm taking it to my dad's"" in anger since I'm so tired of never being able to use my own cup. I was also mad since he'll always make drinks of coffee for just him and my mum and then use my cup to drink out of it but won't even think of making it for me when he's using my cup. I get I don't make drinks for him either but he knows it's my cup and how much I love coffee when my mum doesn't really care for it she's just ok with it but that's still what he does. He came back in a minute later and said something along the lines of ""well if you're taking it to your dad's then I'll take the TV out your room that I gave you then."" Sooooo he has had this TV for years, and when they got a way bigger one for the front room he put it in my room since he didn't want to get rid of it and at the time they didn't want my brother to have a TV in his room because of his age. He didn't give it to me since it's very clear it's to stay there when I move out. I know he wants my younger sister to have my room.

He ended up going outside and arguing with my mum about it. She came back in and shouted at me. I was filling the mug with water and was about to wash it when she came in, but I ended up leaving it with soap and water in the sink with a coffee mark at the top still when I went upstairs got dressed and did my makeup after she had a go at me. When I came down, I saw Craig was making more coffee again just for him and my Mum and he had the mug next to him. I got mad and poured hot water in it and washed it again. He was mad at me asking why I'm cleaning it since I don't need to as he was about to have a ""nice big coffee"" I don't remember what I replied but maybe I said like ""it's mine and I don't want you to use it"" he went all mad and I washed it and put it on the draining board then he got a regular cup out instead.

An hour later my mum came to me and told me he's planning to take my TV put my room whilst I'm at my dads later that day and said she had convinced him to take something else instead of my TV and she said my Nintendo switch. But my Nintendo switch has nothing to to do with him! It was a gift for me and my brother when it released back in 2017. Again, years before we knew or met Craig. It's been in my room since the ps5 came out since my brother stopped using it completely and just uses his ps5 so I kept it in my room. I was going to my dad's after the arguing and my mum made me bring down the switch and give it to Craig including all the docking station. I gave it to him and I've since gone to my dad's but I didn't even take the mug with me. I honestly prefer to use it there since I have loads of gorgeous mugs at my dads that I use since I know he won't use them or put them in the dishwasher to ruin the design (Craig chipped my other two mugs I have at my mum's by putting them in, luckily the nightmare before Christmas one is dishwasher safe)

But now I'm thinking I greatly overreacted with it. But it was just the way he acted about it, so rude and never cleaning it. And the Nintendo switch he took since he was mad at me was a gift from my mum to me and my brother before we even met him so it makes no sense for him to take that?? I guess it's a supplement for the TV but I'm still annoyed. I guess some people could say it's just a mug but it's the way it shows how he treats my things. Still, AIO??

I recently re-started with self study for the last few months, looking at some online material such as [https://progress.lawlessfrench.com/revision/grammar/by-cefr-level](https://progress.lawlessfrench.com/revision/grammar/by-cefr-level) in addition to flashcards and just watching heaps of podcasts on youtube.

In all of my schooling, and many other videos and material I have seen, the verbs were taught by themselves.  
Recently I have begun with a tutor on Italki who is great (also would 1000% recommend this to anyone learning french. Save your money on overpriced coffees and get a tutor in Italki).

Today she introduced my to this concept and I feel like it cleared up so much for me with such a basic suggestion (no more second guessing and confusing prepositions in the middle of talking.)

For example, learning the entire chunk of ""S'occuper de"" vs learning just the verb and trying to come up with the preposition.

1jctk6i,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Training-Promotion71/comments/1jctk6i/physical_theory_and_naive_metaphysics_part_2/,Physical theory and naive metaphysics part 2,"*Physical theater* is a notion I invented to capture points I made about the physical theory deemed as an illusion of human sense that humans are epistemically priviledged or special. Physical theory was clearly a misguided attempt to elevate human understanding to the level of angelic knowledge, assuming we could[ever] grasp the ""structure"" or nature of the world. It is precisely for its failure that we have empirical sciences. 


Let's now appeal to Thomistic angelology to make a point about *angelizing* our cognition clearer. By Thomistic angelology, the way angels aquire knowledge isn't by abstraction from sense perception. They do not arrive at concepts by abstracting away from experience, because angels have no physical senses. Angels possess a cognitive mechanism which has access to God's thoughts, therefore, forms or archetypes in God's mind. When they think of a universal like 'justice' they know all particulars which fall under. In fact, each universal they contact is like a crystal ball in which all concrete instantiations of the property of justice are revealed. 


Physical theory was in fact an intuition that we have angelic knowledge as explained in Thomistic fashion. As angels would grasp universals in God's mind, we thought that humans could grasp the structure of the world. But that means that we possess a cognitive mechanism which makes the world intelligible to our intuitions and understanding. As L. Peikoff pointed out, and as myriad of intellectuals from the period of Darwin till 21st century liked to say: humans are organic creatures, they are not Thomistic angels.


Socrates believed that after we die, our souls get immersed in generalities, thus a socratic gnosis is angelic, since by death one aquires the knowledge of all general truths. This is *semantic omniscience* and there's another notion as Putnam called it, namely *semantic omnipotence* which is the notion that semantic powers are not restricted by immediate physicalities(me having an experience of the external world without there being an external world), thus one can conceive of the things which are not there or don't even exist in the universe, and the conjunction of the two partakes in angelic cognition. Notice, I am taking the strong version of semantic omnipotence, since I have no idea why Putnam thinks that weaker version is problematic; which is that angels can observe things that are long gone or are yet to happen as if they were in their immediate surrounds. Notice as well that Socrates wasn't saying that we could ever aquire angelic gnosis as humans. He said, that death consists of souls enjoying the absolute knowledge of eternal truths, so there's no reasoning from particular cases in order to arrive at some principle out of which you can deduce some other particular cases. There's angelic gnosis which doesn't consider what happens *here* and *now*. 


Suppose there's an embodied angelic creature with human-like form. Just like humans, the angel can turn his head to scan the environment. Unlike humans, his vision isn't limited to surfaces and angles. Whatever he looks at, he perceives in full, thus a genuine 3D, from all sides at once. This creature could gaze at a car, see the car's exterior from all sides at once, as if its mind encircled the car; and instantly grasp its exterior and interior simultaneously at will, as if its mind encircled the car *completely*. Notice, no barrier could obstruct its sight, since walls, clouds, or even vast cosmic distances wouldn't matter. 

There's a sentence which was in the back of my head when I wrote this, which is a sentence in italian language from my favourite anime 'Saint Seiya' in which the peculiar individual named Arles who can travel at the speed of light(islamic canon says that angels move at the speed of light) and whose mask you can see on my avatar, says: ""Nulla può sfuggire al mio sereno sguardo che tutto sovrasta!"", which is in translation: ""Nothing can escape my serene gaze that overwhelms/penetrates/dominates everything"". I think this is the best way to put it, namely the statement any angel would use in declaring his perceptual capacities. It is Huxley's *Mind at large* at will.

Angelic creature therefore, possesses telescopic, microscopic and simultaneous perception without any gaps. Distance doesn't affect the clarity of the objects an angelic observer observes, regardless of head orientation or eye movement. This fancy angel could gaze at the night sky toward Saturn and see it in a perfect detail, as clearly as I see this cup of coffee on my table. At will, he could engage his microscopic perception, zooming in on the scene to observe Saturn on molecular level. It is clear that humans would't be able to match angelic perception even with instruments. 


The state of the angelic cognitive system's language faculty is in the state P, namely P-language or perfect language. Angel's thoughts are such that when he observes his surrounds each object directly names itself in the angel's mind. As opposed to my contention about human cognition; the world imposes itself onto the angel's intellect without any need to reason from or to, as contended with the example of angelic gnosis. The angel's thoughts are directly linked to reality and I cannot think of a better example than simply citing 'mirrors', for the condition of angelic cognition is transparency condition. Transparent knowledge of the world is a self-explanatory notion. It means that the knowledge of the world broadly is identical to what the world is. So, to repeat that the angelic cognition is perfectly transparent. Imagine swapping the mind and the environment: the angel’s mental content would be a perfect reflection of reality, encompassing every object in its field of view. When an angel makes observations, the world itself ""speaks"" its reality into the angel's mind. Thought and perception become one. What's in the angel's mind is the world in its visual field. The swapping analogy works just fine. 

Putnam's suggestion that we have full meaning of a word by virtue of empirical sciences is approximating angelic knowledge. Kripke distanced himself from these strong externalist talks. Putnam's real intention is widely ignored, since the question he posed was: ""How do we actually know what we are referring too?"". Nevertheless, the point stands.

Frege's contention that the words refer to extra-mental objects is an unwitting admission to angelic intuitions. Referentialist dogma was way too strong in times when linguistics was not a scientific field. The issue is that language doesn't even remotely work like that. Moreover, in the context of technical terms and entities of our best explanatory theories in the sciences by which we identify what we deem to be physical properties of the various phenomena in the world; the sciences don't work like that. It is genuinely unbelievable that some popular physicists constantly delude themselves into thinking that science is potentially omnipotent, thus that it can push us at the front of genuine omniscience, and they constantly conflate the models of the world and the world. 


No philosopher I know of would ever concede angelic perception. I am not sure whether angels, if they existed, would need perception at all. The examples I've used are interesting in all sorts of ways, e.g., these angelic mental capacities are widely reported by NDErs. In fact, I took most of them from NDE reports. That's beside the point, except if we are interested to uncover the origin of these intuitions or follow leading experts in the field who are still trying to figure out what is going on. My worry is that way too many people cannot disentagle these angelic intuitions from the actual ""facts"", and by the facts I mean, there's lack of internalization of the scope and boundaries of human cognition. Of course that it's an open question whether we are really animals or souls or whatever. But, it is a dream of traditional philosophy to reach angelic gnosis, which started with Socrates, if we ignore some other suggestions from Parmenides and the like. How many people still believe we can hold the world in our minds and solve its mysteries from the armchair?

I am not happy at my job.  I am a technology/management consultant, mainly focusing on ERP selections and deliveries.  I've been working here since I graduated in 2022.  I am paid pretty well and I like my coworkers, but I am just not a fan of the work.  I'm not interested in the problems I'm solving.  I don't care about ERPs.  I don't want to talk to anyone about their AP Automation process.  I don't want to think about setting meetings up with warehouse management system vendors.  It's all just deeply uninteresting to me and I feel like I don't fit in with my coworkers, who all went to school for industrial engineering or finance (I have an English degree).

I've been looking for other jobs here and there but I'm having trouble applying my experience to other positions/types of companies.  I don't want to leave this just just to do the same thing somewhere else.  I want to be part of a team that creates something, so product management or brand management seems more enticing to me.  However, I'm finding that my experience doesn't really carry over at this point in my career since I'm still pretty junior, and the jobs that sound interesting require design experience that I don't have.

Where should I be looking to work?  I'm at a coffee shop right now and the people next to me are having a brainstorming session on something related to their jobs, and I miss that energy from school.  I want to collaborate with others on executing a cool, creative project and not just determining the best way to architect software or approach a deadline to having fixed asset data ready to bring to a new system.  I have an English degree and I miss that level of writing/subjectiveness/being surrounding by people that want to be creative.  I don't want to touch SAP or NetSuite ever again lol.

If anyone is reading this and is in Chicago and wants to help out, please let me know!  I am willing to take a bit of a pay cut to be more fulfilled.  I have trouble articulating exactly what I want to do, so follow up questions are appreciated.",1,1742153424.0,careerguidance,0,1.0,False
1jctgyo,https://www.reddit.com/r/Agoraphobia/comments/1jctgyo/will_going_back_home_be_a_big_help/,Will going back home be a big help ?,"Before moving abroad, I never had anxiety. I was always out, had many friends, hobbies, and even played football professionally. I was a bit stressed and had mild OCD, but nothing major.

When I left my home country six years ago, everything was exciting—new culture, new city, new university. I partied, socialized, and enjoyed my time. Even during COVID, I lived with roommates, so it was fine. My last year of university was great, too—going out, dating, and having fun.

After graduating, I decided to stay and work for a few years. At first, things were good. My job was manageable, I had a social life, and I still went out. But over time, things changed. My friends got busy with work or relationships, and I moved farther from the city center. The commute was long, public transport was limited, and I started going out less. As I got promoted, work became overwhelming—long hours, sleep deprivation, poor diet, excessive coffee and nicotine. My social life faded, and I kept postponing leaving, telling myself I was lucky to have a job.

The breaking point came after a stressful work period. I was constantly working, barely sleeping, and suddenly started feeling nauseous in meetings. One day, I had to attend an early morning event after almost no sleep. I felt severe nausea, panicked about throwing up in front of people, and kept stepping out. The next day, I had a panic attack during a video call, told my manager I was sick, and never worked again. I used my vacation days, then resigned.

After that, I became completely housebound—couldn’t see people, even on video calls, or go to the grocery store. The worst part? I was too anxious to fly home. I spent three months trapped in this cycle before realizing I had to change. Therapy helped—I slowly started going out, taking public transport, and recently began socializing more. But I still struggle with the fear of nausea and panic in social situations.

Now, I feel staying here isn’t good for me. Even though I’ve made progress, I have nothing to do—I go out for a couple of hours, then nothing. I’ve tried books, running, and learning new things, but I feel like all I want is to go home. Still, it feels hard to recover more cause its like im here focusing on fixing my anxiety and once i do i go back home and i think its a wrong mindset, plus I hate it alot here now so staying doesnt help.

I’ve uploaded a photo of my lipid panel. My overall cholesterol is 218 and my LDL is 147. I do understand that lowering my LDL is extremely important. 

Since these results I’ve lost about 10lbs by walking between 8k-10k steps per day (slowly working up my endurance for other activities.) I’ve also been consistently hitting my fiber goal (25g / day) since these results, and in a caloric deficit.

My question is what neighborhoods we should check out.

We are looking for something that is good for doing things outside… letting the kid explore, taking dogs for a walk, running, biking etc. Would be great if the neighborhood had decent walkability. Not everything needs to be in walking distance, but would be great to have quick access to coffee shop, couple of restaurants, and a small grocer. Extra bonus points if there’s a deep sense of community in that area. We currently live in a city that has a deep sense of neighborhood and community.

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

# Personal Experience (Charl’s Perspective)

Charl, the friendly and ever-curious owner of my local coffee shop, decided to give Sumatra Slim Belly Tonic a go after our morning chats about sleep and health sparked her interest.

A self-proclaimed night owl, Charl often struggles with getting enough rest—something she blamed on the late-night buzz of espresso experimentation.

After trying the tonic for a week, Charl shared her thoughts over my usual oat latte. “I’ve actually been falling asleep faster,” she said, sounding genuinely surprised. “And I’m not waking up at 3 a.m. thinking about the perfect brew temperature anymore!”

Two weeks in, Charl noticed a shift—not just in how she slept, but in how she felt. She reported having more energy to manage the morning rush and even mentioned her jeans fitting a little better.

That said, Charl wasn’t entirely sold on the taste. “It’s not bad, but it reminds me of steeping herbs for tea—an earthy kick I didn’t expect.” While the flavor wasn’t a dealbreaker for her, it’s something to consider for those with more sensitive palates.

All in all, Charl gave it a thumbs up and joked, “If it keeps me sleeping better, maybe I won’t need that fourth espresso in the afternoon!” Her take? Small changes add up when you actually feel the difference.

Based on the analysis, the top ten grocery food items most affected by pricing due to tariffs, commonly found in Toronto stores and part of a standard household’s diet, are:

1. **Apples**: Heavily imported from the US, subject to tariffs on fruits.
2. **Oranges**: Major US import, impacted by vegetable tariffs.
3. **Grapes**: Significant US supply, affected by fruit tariffs.
4. **Tomatoes**: Imported from US and Mexico, but US share impacted.
5. **Lettuce**: US is a key supplier, tariffs increase costs.
6. **Beef**: High US import share, meat tariffs apply.
7. **Pork**: Notable US imports, subject to meat tariffs.
8. **Peanut Butter**: Often US-branded, processed food tariffs apply.
9. **Frozen Pizzas**: If imported from US, processed food tariffs impact.
10. **Soft Drinks**: US brands may see price hikes if imported.

These items are likely to see price increases due to the 25% tariff, affecting household budgets, especially for fresh produce and meats.

# Top Ten Least Affected Items

The top ten items least affected, with minimal US import reliance, are:

1. **Milk**: Domestically produced, supply management limits US imports.
2. **Eggs**: Primarily domestic, not significantly imported from US.
3. **Bread**: Made from domestic grains, minimal US import impact.
4. **Rice**: Imported from Asia, not US, unaffected by tariffs.
5. **Bananas**: Sourced from Latin America, no US import reliance.
6. **Coffee**: Imported from various countries, not US, stable prices.
7. **Tea**: Global imports, minimal US involvement, unaffected.
8. **Sugar**: Sourced globally, not primarily from US, stable.
9. **Flour**: Domestic production, not impacted by US tariffs.
10. **Butter**: Domestically produced, supply management limits imports.

These items should see little to no price change, offering stability for household shopping.

I'm a software engineer from Boston, my husband is attending the Nvidia conference and I tagged along to make a vacation of it. I'm looking for things in the area that are related to computers, are unique to the area, or are just general recommendations. My goal is to relax so it doesn't need to all be activities.

I'm planning to go to the computer history museum. I've seen there's also the Intel museum and the Google experience, can anyone comment if these are worth the visit? Is there anything else related I'm missing?

My other planned activities so far are Fillroy yarn, Japantown, possibly the Winchester Mystery House, and I might go see some of the nearby redwoods. I rented a car so I have some range.

I'm also looking for local coffee spots. I went to Nirvana Soul this morning and it was great, then I walked over to City Bagel. The architecture and murals in your city are lovely.

1jcsw8x,https://www.reddit.com/r/Apartmentliving/comments/1jcsw8x/starting_over_in_an_apt/,Starting over in an apt,"Hi all. I’m getting the keys to my apt on Friday. I have 50% custody of my tween, & I’m in my late 30’s. It is a 1 bedroom flat - the top floor of a house, the lower floor is the only other unit in the house. I chose it because it was the only in budget place where my child could walk to school/very safe walkable neighborhood. I looked for places every day for over a year. We have lived in an even smaller 1 bedroom in my late 20’s/early 30’s so we have some experience. It does have charm and some good features but it will be an adjustment from living with my partner for 4 yrs with a finished basement, 3 floors, plenty of space. 

I am giving my child the bedroom as I want them to have comfort, space for themselves as they are growing up. We will have to be here at least 3 more years while I finish school & get settled in my career. 

This leaves the living room for me. When we had the smaller 1 bedroom I slept on a cheap small couch from wayfair that just easily folded down. I don’t think I could swing that now as my body has a lot more issues that I manage & spend a lot of energy trying to feel good with physical therapy etc. It definitely bums me out to not have a living space though so I am just looking for advice — 

lean in and make the living room a full on bedroom for me? My child and I can share time together in the kitchen which is quite spacious & has a nook. We already watch shows & movies in bed sometimes so we can do that. 

Or do you have a recommendation couch that doubles as a bed that is actually comfortable & functional (and low budget) so I could transition the living room to have people over / spend family time, but still have a true feel like it’s a bed for me? I am bombarded with adds for couches that seem to form a bed but I think it is not meant to be someone’s full time bed. 

Will it be odd to have people over with only a kitchen or bed to spend time in? I definitely want to have my friends & (non serious) dates over, as well as for my child to have their friends over. Though my main focus at this time is healing, studying, solitude I’ve been in a dead bedroom relationship for years & am definitely excited to host dates & the fun of an occasional sleepover on a night I do not have my kid. 

Or should I attempt to split the living room space even if it’s a bit awkward with a limited layout? So try and manage a bed + loveseat/coffee table somehow? 

Another option is the bedroom is a decent size so I could have a twin bed for my child & put a small couch in the bedroom to spend time on. It is larger than the living room but still the layout might be tricky because there are radiators etc. 

I’m open to any advice about functional furniture or how to make this a lovely place I will be fond of! What is your experience in making a 1 bedroom work for 2?

Coffee break after making rounds at the Philippine Book Festival—10k steps in, but our poor feet! 🥲 So many people even on the last day! Some books on my list were out of stock (MIBF or sale it is 🤞), but I did get one signed and spotted some fave authors (too shy for a selfie, lol).

Best part? Watching my son enjoy his first PBF—so many books and activities for kids! Bonus: his parents geeking out over authors and agonizing over which books to buy (and painfully leave behind—hello, bills and responsibilities 👀).

I do wish PBF had a bigger venue like MIBF at SMX MOA—some booths were too crowded or had ongoing signings, making it hard to get in. But that just shows how many people are loving books these days, which is always a great thing!

1jcsprk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Unsent_Unread_Unheard/comments/1jcsprk/cold_coffee/,Cold Coffee.,"I’m lonely this evening. Sunday evenings were *ours*. There’s an emptiness where you used to be, and I feel it in the quietest moments like tonight. The spaces we once filled with laughter and random conversations. The simple comfort of just existing together. 



I find myself remembering the way on Sunday evenings we’d just curl up on the sofa, a glass of wine in hand, wrapped in a warmth that made the rest of the world feel distant. Monday morning and the new workweek restarting in a few hours was the last thing on our minds. We never needed grand gestures, just being together was enough. And for a while, I let myself believe that maybe it would *always* be enough.



But tonight, Sunday evening again, I sit here alone. The television flickering in the corner of my otherwise empty living room, the glass of wine exchanged for a cup of coffee which is growing cold beside me. The silence is deafening. But in that silence, I can still hear the remnants of our conversations; the echoes of a love that was never quite as real and eternal as I convinced myself it would be. I replay the things you said, the way you laughed, the way you looked at me. But it’s all just memories fading with each passing moment, like trying to hold water in my hands.



And even though these Sunday evenings are not meant for us anymore, the truth is, I wouldn’t change it. Because even though it was fleeting, it was so real to me.



I don’t regret caring about you. I don’t regret a single conversation we shared, a single moment we spent together, or a single feeling I had for you. You were someone who mattered to me in a way I can’t quite put into words.



Maybe you are curled up on your sofa with a glass of our favourite wine. But whatever you’re doing this Sunday evening, I will only ever wish you happiness. And I hope, in time, I'll find mine again too.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) The battle of the Bay Area, minus the actual battle, since it's just a preseason game. The San Francisco Giants are looking to make some noise in the MLB this year, and with the addition of Adames and the veteran presence of Verlander, they might just have a shot. But let's not get ahead of ourselves, it's just spring training, folks!

Lee Jung-hoo, the Korean sensation, is taking a day off to rest his lower back, because, you know, precautionary measures and all that jazz. But don't worry, he'll be back in the lineup soon, crushing it like he has been in spring training, with a .300 batting average and 2 home runs.

Now, onto the game at hand. The Oakland Athletics are looking to spoil the Giants' party, but I'm not buying it. The Giants have the talent, the depth, and the momentum (yes, even in spring training) to take down their cross-bay rivals.

My best bet for this game is the San Francisco Giants on the moneyline, currently priced at 1.67 across most bookmakers. The Giants have been looking sharp in spring training, and even without Lee Jung-hoo, they have enough firepower to take down the Athletics.

As for the spread, I'd take the Giants -1.5, priced at 2.3 on DraftKings. The Giants have been playing well, and I expect them to come out strong against the Athletics.

And finally, the total. I'd take the under 10.5, priced at 1.83 on BetMGM. Spring training games can be a bit unpredictable, but I think the Giants' pitching will be able to keep the Athletics in check.

So, there you have it, folks. The Giants will take down the Athletics, and I'll be here, sipping my coffee, looking smart.",1,1742151018.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

But this time, I really enjoyed it. It felt different, and I’m pretty sure she had a good time too.

Outside of these yearly meetups, we don’t really keep in touch. I wish I was better at texting, but honestly, I might be the worst texter on the planet. And up until now, our catch-ups have just been that—talking, nothing more.

But after seeing her this time, I can’t stop thinking I should go for it. She’s an amazing person, and I’d regret not trying.

So here’s where I need advice: what should I do next? I know this might be a dumb question, but I’ve never dated anyone before, so I’m pretty clueless about what to do or how to go about it.

Should I tell her how I feel? Maybe ask if she'd be open to getting to know each other on a deeper level?

The dr. gave me something to drink called a GI cocktail can’t remember the name of what it was nevertheless it made me feel better, told me to take famodidine. Went a few weeks feeling a bit better then started getting heartburn on and off. Went to another dr, kept getting worse. She then prescribed omeprezol and miralax for constipation. had an xray dr said moderate stool backup was nothing to worry about. After 5 days I stopped the omprezol, made 
me feel horrible. But now my symptoms have completely gone off the rails, dealing all day everyday worse at night. I eat healthy. Trying low formal but it doesn’t do anything really because everything triggers it I could drink water and be bloated. 

Im really scared/nervous about the light at the end of the tunnel and if there even is one. I’ve read many stores and many people have had this for years. I’ve been dealing with this for about 6 months now. And had planned on trying for a baby with my partner. But definitely can’t until I get things fixed. Drs just want to throw pills at it, which I wouldn’t have an issue with but my body is very sensitive to any medication, im pretty crunchy and never even take ibuprofen let alone many other meds I’ve had reactions to.

I recently did a boiler teardown and replacement in a Gaggia classic. We were having to take out the solenoid valve every two months or so to declog it so we finally broke down and bought a new replacement boiler. Prior to buying a replacement boiler we bought a new solenoid valve at the beginning of the year, but since we were still having the problem we figured replacing the boiler was the way to go. We also replaced one of the thermostats since we broke one of the prongs off trying to get the old boiler out. 

  
We finally got everything all wired up and turned on the machine. Everything was functioning the way it was suppose to but unfortunately we are still getting very little water from the group head. We did take the solenoid off yesterday and soaked the thing with the two holes in pure gaggia brand descaler. I quickly soaked the valve part of the solenoid quickly in a solution of 50/50 descaler/water solution and we reassembled it. Thankfully we are still getting a good strong flow from the steamwand. 

I am wondering if we need to pull off the solenoid again and descale it or if there are other problems perhaps. 

Thank you all in advance!!

I(13) woke up because my cat was nagging me and meowing and usually starts whenever he hears movement and think it’s me and is hungry. Fed him but noticed black cat was outside and the door happened to be cracked which usually means my mom just got home from getting her coffee or my brother getting her cigarettes from the car. I went to my mom to ask her what my brother got for her and she was confused. Also sleeping deeply. I woke her up and I looked in his room and he was gone. I called and he told me he was at the park and oh he’s going in the gym give him 10 minutes and when I call again he’s like 10 more minutes. And I wanted to believe him so much. But he’s gotten into fights there. I told him that I was so scared. Cause my mom left to go get him but she told me not to tell him she knew he was all the way across the town. But i hate being home alone and always have cause i get super paranoid cause we live in the woods and i always call my mom a lot and get told that I need to go the psych ward cause I’m nuts or something. 
I called him crying and he was like “okay okay stop” like annoyed. 
My brother is only 14 and turning 15 in April.  he has high functioning autism. But you can’t even tell he has autism I don’t know if that’s a trait or something. But anyways I call my mom and keep telling her he’s at the park and oh someone let him in the gym with their card and he told me he will be outside and if he went out the gym she would see him. and she stated “m/n, he’s at ___’s house”. I was so mad. He completely took advantage of my vulnerability. He told me he was at the park so many times and I believed him. I knew it didn’t sound like the park. Cause the birds are chirping. But I didn’t want to say anything. She also told me he was coming home a Uber that his friend payed for. I don’t know how he got a uber in our community because he doesn’t know how to call in a pass for anything. His derelict friend probably did something to get the uber in cause you have to be a resident to call in a pass + need to tell them your lot number and passcode or something idk. And my brother who now knows my mom is coming, wastes her time and Ubers back with his friends money, and comes home. And my mom on the other side of town starts driving back. My brother is the first to come home. I open the door angrily and yell at him to come inside. He says no many times cause im mad and he thinks I will hit him. Cause I used to throw tantrums a couple years ago and I would hit him. Not like in a crazy way though. Now I don’t because i know it’s wrong. I ask him why he thinks he can just go to his friends house and he gets mad cause we don’t let him go anywhere. He doesn’t get a say in where he can go right now.

Background info

Basically he got into a fight at school and got “beat up” but in the video there was no connecting punches. Only had a minor scratch. But he was so mad because it was an ex friend of his that did it. It was in the bathroom so nobody found out. So the next day he goes to the cafeteria. Brings a chair all the way across the school to his classroom. No teacher tried to stop him. Cause oh it’s totally normal to charge down the hallway with a chair. He charges in the classroom and throws the chair at the back of the kids head so this kid got a concussion. The school expelled him and the boy. And my brother is getting criminal charges from the police. And my mom has to pay $3000 for an attorney and go to a hearing. The school is trying to make it look like he’s the stereotypical gangster minority because it’s Pennsylvania of course. But the school is trying to get my mom to make a agreement with my brother and forget anything happened because she found out they took him off restricted movement without telling her and also I think is actively trying to take away his IEP cause they don’t believe he’s autistic. My family is from park slope and now that my brothers a freshman hes growing up with gangsters and trying to be “like that” because a bunch of his friends are from ny and are in gangs. Not too long ago he was in what they call “grape street cripps”. And we arent affiliated or anything but we’re automatically bloods so I was pisswd. And hes sagging hes pants. Which by the way is super gay but he won’t believe me when I say it.

Back to the story

I move so he can come inside and grab him and then push him to his room cause Im so mad. When he’s in the hall back from putting his phones in my mom’s room. I ask him if he’s on drugs and check his pupils. Then I yell at him telling him he’s not a gangster and I yell “YOU’RE FUCKING FROM BROOKLYN”. Which by the way the part I lived in had 0 gangsters. But it probably did. Cause real gangsters keep it on the downlow and don’t tell everyone they’re gangsters. That’s how you get caught. He goes to his room. And I go in mine. Right now it’s 9:04 am. So he got here at 8:15 am. My mom hasn’t come inside yet.
Im so mad at my brother. He thinks he’s a victim when he’s not. And he keeps doing sneaky stuff. Hes like oh they’re probably gonna give me “probation” so hes not worried a bit. But he doesn’t even know what probation is. And he thinks that he’s tough but he’s scared of me. His 5’1 In a half little sister. I asked him if he’s scared of me then how would he react if someone pulled a gun on him. Which he thinks isn’t likely but it is. Now my mom wants to move to Georgia so my brother can be with a “man” aka her boyfriend who is a money stealing stoner that she doesn’t want to leave. I told her I didn’t want to move with his loser ass. She said we wouldn’t live with him but you know see him. I don’t like men. In fact everytime he comes over here i stay in my room even when I need to use the bathroom or am hungry because im not used to a man in the house. I don’t like men not even my dad or male teachers. Every man makes me anxious. Her second option is Virginia. Which I am very sure I would like to move to. 
I don’t want to make this about me.
Trust. But i feel like everytime my brother does something wrong he sucks up all the attention. Sure I used to get a lot of attention but now it’s like “make your brother food please. Be a good sister” from my mom and especially my grandma. And if I don’t then my grandma will call me selfish and greedy and horrible. Cause she grew up doing things for her siblings. Im not saying im neglected but i just kinda feel lost. I don’t want any form of therapy or to tell anyone anything. I have friends but they wouldn’t get how I’m feeling. Im kinda just like fantasizing about someone who I could confide in. I know I won’t tell anyone how I feel about him doing everything. Because why would this be about me?

I asked him to be my boyfriend in March 2024 but we'd been going out since October the previous year. I have had several relationships, some of which ended well and others did not. Some exes I consider friends, while others I do not talk to at all. My boyfriend has only had one long-term serious relationship and is friends with that ex.

They dated for like 5.5 yrs and lived together for at least 3yrs. She stayed in the apartment where they lived which is near a beach and he stores his surfboards there. Inevitably, he does surfing sometimes which entails going to her place for the board and then showering after. Sometimes, they might hang out. Other times, he meets up with her for breakfast or coffee once a month or so. It took a while for him to introduce me and I have seen her 2-3 times the entire time we've been dating. I have been vocal in wanting to spend time with her in order to understand their friendship dynamic and I have been supportive to the idea that you can be friends with an ex even if I'm not that close with my exes.

I got upset when one time she called him at 10:30 PM on a Sunday night after he got home from a trip, realizing that maybe they are closer than I had understood. I asked him to ""tidy up"" his belongings at her place which included a bike and skateboard he didn't use and some other lingering things that he just hadn't cleared out besides the surfboards which I can understand why he stores there. I also asked him to stop using her streaming services because I didn't need to see what she'd been watching or their joint names on a Netflix account two years after they'd broken up. After a lot of discussions and nearly breaking up, he stubbornly complied.

Now, after taking a trip with his family which overall was a positive bonding experience and brought us closer together, I found out that he talks to his ex 1-2 times per week on the phone. I am upset and feel like I've been deceived. I thought I had gotten a grasp on the nature of their friendship, but this is new information that I'm having a hard time digesting. He doesn't talk with any other friend that sort of frequency, and he insists that she's just a friend. Furthermore, he doesn't talk about her with me to the point that it's weird to have not heard her name in a while, so I'll ask about her.

I'm in a position where I've agreed his being friends with his ex is ok, but I feel like he's overstepped a boundary by maintaining contact and sharing with her beyond what I'd considered a ""normal friendship."" If he'd been open about that and made me feel included, I might feel differently, but that hasn't been the case. I'm at a loss for what to do. I want a serious and secure relationship, and I feel his behavior undermines that.

How do I support his need to be friends with his ex while feeling respected and ensuring that we are on the same page regarding what we want from our relationship?

TLDR: My boyfriend \[35M\]  is friends with his exgf and now I \[35F\] am upset because I found out they talk on the phone multiple times a week.",1,1742150258.0,relationship_advice,4,0.57,False
1jcs9zm,https://www.reddit.com/r/socialanxiety/comments/1jcs9zm/feeling_trapped/,Feeling trapped.,"I (M22) work in fast food. Chick-Fil-A, to be specific. I love it, it’s good work. I am also a college student who has no interest in being in college. I am in college because I want to make my parents proud. I couldn’t tell you why, but I want to. I’m also hiding my sexuality (gay) so that they will remain proud of me. I go to class for about 15 hours weekly, plus 40-50 hours per week at the restaurant. All of that is totally manageable for me, but it’s exhausting. 

The delima:

This is a routine I am happy with. Wake up, go to class, go to work, go home. Sundays are my only days to relax, but I also want to have freinds. It’s hard having freinds while in this routine, because I’m either in class, at work, or simply too exhausted to do anything. It’s becoming less enjoyable now, because I’ve noticed the people I know make zero effort to hang out anymore. They know that I’ll either say no or sleep through any plans that are made. In the off-chance I don’t sleep through, it’s not fun because I’m so tired. 

Further:

There is also the issue that I don’t enjoy the things that most people around me enjoy doing. I’m uncomfortable in bars and at parties and such. My “fun with freinds” is getting a coffee for an hour or walking at the park or something. I only know one other person who is like this, and I work with her. She now has a boyfreind (SO HAPPY for her! cheering her on) so I don’t see her outside of work anymore.

Responses aren’t necessary. I just know you people actually put the effort in to read posts on here, so I just wanted to ramble about my situation. It makes me feel a little better. Thanks.",1,1742150194.0,socialanxiety,0,1.0,False

1jcs9qt,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jcs9qt/we_where_lovers_now_she_wants_to_just_be_friends/,We where lovers now she wants to just be friends,Hello Reddit I’m a 21 year old man that was dating this beautiful woman that was 19. Me and her shared many intimate moments with one another. But she had many issues with me where she would get angry or upset at me over very small things. For example one time she was supposed to come over to my house to spend time with me and I went and bought us food earlier in the day and I had ate some of it and left the rest for her. I waited for her to come but I don’t remember the reason on why she couldn’t but she had asked me to bring her the food and it was a very small amount of food and I sent her the picture are you sure. She was like yes I want you to bring it but I couldn’t even spend time with her if I did. So I told her I wouldn’t and she got very upset at me and I later had gave in and drove over there to make her happy. But she was still upset at me and this was around 6 months into us dating. Another example of her getting upset at me was we had plans to go to a mall and we go and she visited all of her stores she wanted to and I as somewhat nerdy wanted to look and see if they had a comic book store and while we are walking around she starts getting agitated and annoyed she say she’s hot and doesn’t want to walk anymore and this was weird for me because she never had an issue like this in the past. When we finally find the store I go inside she steps out and when I walk out she is now crying I hug her and comfort her and we leave we don’t talk in the car ride to the next store. But that is some examples of what she would get mad at me about nothing you can’t talk out in a relationship what I would think. But here comes up to our 9th month of being together she goes on a trip for 2 days and comes back and I wouldn’t be able to see her even when she got back because she was behind on school work which is okay. I’m at work and I’m talking to her on the phone and she was telling me about the incident where she didn’t want to walk anymore and leave and started saying I am immature and don’t use common sense. And we are talking and talking and we eventually hang up and I finally start txting her and hour later about very thoughtful stuff about how much I care for her and ext. She starts getting defensive with me over txt so I call her and she saying idk what I want anymore and I’m like spit it out then be honest with me. And she finally says I don’t want to be with you anymore then say but we can be friends. I did everything with this woman every day like life tasks and ext almost every day of mine was spent doing something for her. I had done many construction projects for her work on her car took care of her siblings even and this is what I get. I am in love with this woman and I still have a feeling she does with me. So I don’t go strait into no contact we are still talking on the phone about the situation and stuff and she had asked me if I wanted my things back I told her I only wanted one thing back and she comes over to my house with multiple people and gives me everything back. I am dumb founded I tell her I am going to return everything back that I didn’t want later. So here come that time I go over to her house and don’t tell her because now we are in no contact and I leave the stuff on top of her car and then I see a voice message left while I’m driving back towards my house. The voice message was of her little sisters saying why can’t we be friends anymore. I call her immediately and tell her I left all the things on top of her car and I’m already turning around in my car and say wait for me outside I want to talk in person. So I get there and asked if she was okay if we walked and talked she said no I said can we sit in my car and talk she said no. So I get out and we start talking it’s not aggressive talking or that friendly but I’m asking her to keep the stuff that’s hers now she kept saying no no no so I asked her to keep one thing I rip of a pendant from the necklace I bought her and said at least keep this. She says no no no and I am getting fed up she is not reciprocating anything so I asked her if I can get a hug before I leave and she says no no no and we then continue to talk because I don’t want to leave with out at least hugging her just to show some emotion of how much I care so I noticed she looked away for one second and I hugged her and I understand that sounds weird but I needed I needed some type of closure. I hugged her for around 3-5 seconds and let go and then she goes inside and I’m thinking to myself I’m not taking this clothes and necklace with me and throw it in her trash can. She come back outside and her little sisters come outside and say why did you break up with her I was dumb founded when I heard that. So I told her little sister keep this pendant and she told them you better not take that and I got upset because they usually took what ever toys and what not I gave them because I had spent allot of time with them. So I throw the pendant in her front yard in the grass where it still lies to this date. So I leave go home and I don’t remember if we called or texted after but we talked about what just happened and then went to bed. Then the next day we call and txt and eventually it becomes night time we are on the phone talking about each others day and I’m about to go to bed and we hang up then she calls me back later to say goodnight to me like we are still in a relationship and I say goodnight in away that I always did to her which sounds a little seductive and said I didn’t expect you to call me good night but you did. What is that supposed to mean she say idk so we hang up and go to bed. The next day we are txting and I ask her when she is free to meet up for lunch if she was okay with that and she said idk so it comes down to the time she said she would be free and I ask her so can I come meet you and she says idk. I then asked her what if I just show up at the place are you okay with that she said sure and then we are on the phone while driving she says I think I’m going to a different place and I’m like where at she doesn’t tell me and I think with my huge brain and go to the exact location she went to and I sat with her while she ate and we talked about stuff and it kinda sounded like friends but a little more. And I also told her I wouldn’t touch her or anything while we were out. So then she says I’m going somewhere I asked her can I follow and come with she says okay I hop in my car so fast before she even gets in hers I reverse and wait for her to pull out so I can follow her. And while we are driving she calls me saying change of plans I’m going to go talk to a friend at a mall about are situation she say idk if you should come with and to stop following her and I tell her if you are going to talk about our situation then let me come and share my side so we do. And while talking to this girl she seemed like she had no clue why the woman didn’t want to be with me as I am a very respectful and outgoing caring person that is deeply in love with her. So then we leave the mall and go to a coffee place that she wanted to go to and we go in her car together and we go get the coffee go back to the mall and I ask if it’s okay if I stay with her in the car for an hour because she was going to wait for her friend to get off of work to hang out. She said okay and we are in the car talking and talking and I just end up putting my head on her arm and start crying because this whole situation doesn’t make any sense on why she doesn’t want to be with me and only wants to be friends. And she was okay with my head on her and then I start breaking the promise I made with her and start touching her arm she told me to stop and stop but I kept doing it and I understand why that is not a normal thing but with my broken heart and emotions going wild it’s hard to control myself after awhile I back away and then ask her can I get one kiss because I still needed some form of physical closure with her because that’s how I am and I thought if I asked she might say yes then I continued to ask and ask and she said no then i say I’m not leaving the car with out a kiss she says I’ll kiss you on the forehead and so I cover my mouth with my hand and lift my hair and she says no I don’t want to do that you know how to find my lips even with your eyes closed and she is right about that and I would of went for a sneaky kiss but she then refused to do it. Then she goes on her phone and starts scrolling and I catch her look alway for one second and I kiss her on the lips and I understand it’s wrong very wrong to do that but I did I then do it 4 more times she kept telling me to stop I told her if you really didn’t want me to kiss you could of punched me in the face or called the cops on me which she didn’t. But I then leave and while I’m walking to my car both our driver side door are facing right next to each other I leave a kiss on her glass and hop in my car and call her and say I will finally leave you alone. And tell her to look at my window I hold up my phone and click the block button. And drive away I don’t want to be just friends with her I want to be lovers I even saw her as being my wife one day I then get a *67 phone call from her and she asked me did I do something to her car and I’m like what I didn’t do anything she was like okay okay I just wanted to check. She broke the no contact already. Then I go home and suit up to go to a bar with a friend and see if we can get any action I talked to multiple girls their but got rejected by all of them I’m not ugly or anything it’s just the bar i was at for Hispanics I’m not very Dominican papi type I’m Cuban and white. And then I head home unblock her and sit outside I then called her while being pretty drunk and was telling her I kissed three girls and then said maybe I did or maybe I didn’t and I also said I got one of their instagrams. She was kinda upset I could see and I we are talking about how are we supposed to be friends when you know if we do become friends one day I will want more then that. She said maybe will see or maybe we won’t and this was something she did through out this whole time span was being very misleading and saying stuff like that and that’s why I said what I said we hang up on the phone. And I wake up earlier then she does and I didn’t know so I blow up her phone with calls and talked about if their is a possibility of their being more if we become friends she say maybe will see maybe we won’t and we would just be friends. And we kept talking and she said something about maybe we could be more one day that’s all I needed to hear and I also asked how long that will take and started saying one month two months until we got to 6 months she said idk if I will even be ready then so I say I will leave you alone but your number is not blocked. And I have all social media deleted because mental health except TikTok where she know I will look at her stuff.  But I don’t want her to see that it’s me so I have a spoof account I use but that’s all and it’s been 3 days now. I haven’t contacted her but she is posting things like missing him while doing hw and all the songs are about how we were lovers why can’t we be friends. So me with this approximated time of 6 months I have been consuming food like crazy I’m going to bulk and change my body and go hard in the gym I always have but I’m a lean guy. So I’m focusing on my self and I’m okay now I’ve been able to resist myself from txting or calling but I had actually just drove past her house just so I could feel close to her without breaking no contact. I was only there for a second and drove off. But I believe she is doing this to me to teach me a lesson because I know she loves me and thinks about me but I don’t want to just be friends and she knows this. And I have a theory because she told me she never got mad or upset and cried about other people she was with why is it me then and only me she cries about and gets upset at about little things I think it’s because she truly loves me because I know I’m not a bad man but a respectful one that greatly cares for her. Because for a woman to act one way about one person I think that shows she really cares for me and she kinda does that with her family to so I don’t understand why she can’t see me being apart of her family one day and with her more then friends. But to whom ever reads this tell me I’m not crazy but just madly In love and I’ve been with plenty of women and never acted liked this before I think I found the one for me but only with time will tell on how things go I think she will break no contact sooner then later and I will be able to take her out on a date and maybe even be able to hold her hand one day and give her the love that will be swelling up inside of me with every day that passes.

Sa family namin, we’re really close and use to hang often back when they were still single. To give a little background, my cousin who came from a separated parents and was taken care of by our lola since he was young had his girlfriend last year. May mga homophobic remarks sya before nung mas bata pa sya. My sibling naman is the youngest and only girl sa amin and had her girlfriend (yes, she’s gay too) na rin for ig 3 years na?? and they are very loved by our family. Then me who never had a relationship and has an image sa family na hardworking and focus sa goals sa life kaya sometimes okay lang sa kanila wala akong napapakilala and walang pressure.

Recently, I exclusively dated (we both agreed) a guy na sineryoso ko and it didn’t work out. He ended it for a reason idk if t’was really sincere or something was really underneath. But that’s not the story here. Anyway, I feel sad about that until now. And dati, madalas ko lang sinasarili problems ko because of the image nga i portray sa family. But ngayon, i feel like sharing it and di ko na iniisip kung ijujudge ba nila ko or what. So this is how it went:

*talking about random topics including life, finances, and love life*

Me: Im proud sa inyong dalawa na at your age you have that mindset na sa relationship. Actually, the reason i asked u out is kasi broken ako ngayon hahaha

Cousin: Ahh weh? Bat di mo kasi pinapakilala sa min?

Sibling: Oo nga patingin nga.

Me: Eh syempre nahihiya pa ko and all. Tsaka ayun nga di na nagwork diba haha

C: bakit? ilang taon na ba sya? what do u expect from HER?

Me: Wala. Actually, mag 24 pa lang sya and lalake sya.

C: Ah lalaki. Okay lang yan. Wag mo hanapin, kusa yang dadating.

S: Oo, yung akin din di ko rin hinanap.

C: Basta hindi ka nagloko at genuine naman intention mo. Tandaan mo sinasabi ni nanay (our lola) sa tin dati na walang bayad maging mabuti.

The conversation continued and we talked more about life and relationship.

It just went so smooth and very casual with no judgement or surprise from their eyes. Im really proud of them lang talaga na dahil sa background namin at pinagdaanan sa life, hinubog na sila to have that kind of thinking. And at that moment, what was once heavy inside me eventually felt light.

Your girl wanted to meet me, and maybe, in some way, I wanted to meet her too. She’s your world now, the way he is mine. And maybe that’s why that night felt light, natural, even comforting. No tension, no sadness. Just laughter, coffee, and an unspoken understanding.

And I saw it. The way you laughed with her, the way your eyes softened when you looked at her. The same way I looked at him. It wasn’t painful or bittersweet. 

It just felt... right.

When I first heard Paubaya by Moira, I never thought it would be our story.

*""Ako ang kailangan, pero siya ang mahal.""*

Nakakatawa no? Kasi sa kwento natin, ako yung minahal mo. Pero sa huli, pinili mo pa rin yung kailangan mo. 

And so, that night, without words, we let go. *Paubaya*. Not with sadness, not with regret, but with peace. You found your person, and I found mine. And for the first time, I wasn’t looking at you with a question in my heart. Just the acceptance that this was always how our story was meant to end.

This is my last letter to you. Not because I want to forget, but because I don’t need to hold on anymore. You were important to me, and you always will be. 

In my past letters, there was always a *""maybe""*, always a lingering *what-if*. But now, I think this is it.

We were never meant to be each other’s forever.
We were just meant to be the love that prepared us for it.

I went to an ENT, he said my ears looks fine, but I have mild rhinitis and also it could be some damaged auditory nerves due to loud music. He prescribed some antihistamines, nose drops, and ginkgo biloba. I took them for 3 months but my tinnitus is kinda fluctuate, most days is 4/10 and others 2/10. My ears also crackling or popping when I swallow my saliva.

I suspected the club noise or nerve damage due to alcohol.

However, In the last month I did the following:

1- Stopped drinking coffee, but kept smoking hookah.

2- Stopped alcohol (although in the past I was only drinking like once every 2 weeks, but heavily).

3- Took the following supplements from iHerb: 300mg Magnesium, Zen NeuraZenx Nerve support, Swanson Ear Essentials, Myrrh Extract 650 mg, EVLution Berberine Root Extract, 200mg L-theanine and a regular multivitamins.

My tinnitus is now barely noticeable at 0.5/10.

I also noticed the following this week:

1- I cannot sneeze for some reason and unable to complete the sneeze, probably the rhinitis

2- My ears still crackling or popping when I swallow my saliva.

4 nights/ 5 days in early June

Disclaimer- we do not like crowds or packs of tourists which is why we are avoiding MA
We would like to see wildlife and explore/ hike. 

Option A
Would you go to La Fortuna? We booked Los Lagos resort . Its refundable. We have been to thermal springs in the summer before in Italy and while it was nice I am not sure I want to hang out with lots of drunk tourists in the pools. Italy was very quiet and not a party scene which we liked. I would prefer low key. So that is my hesitation here. There seem to be many activities in La Fortuna but the hanging bridges and waterfall are probably the only ones we will follow through on along with a chocolate/ coffee tour and possibly a night walk. 


Option B : ecolodge on the South Pacific side. We have not booked anything yet as we are unsure whether to cancel los Lagos. I like the idea of a quiet place with a beach and few crowds. Will we be missing the point of coming to this country to be in a small place? We can likely take a cab for lunch/dinner each night to a local soda. We are interested in seeing the real CR not just the tourist stuff.

This has moderator approval. It's posted here instead of on r/Pen_Swap because beginners tend not to know about that sub and this giveaway is intended for beginners and/or those on a budget (honor system). A shim might be only $3 but if you have a $50 minimum order requirement, then getting one could be a problem. And I know I hate buying a pack of paper I've never tried only to dislike it. So I am offering a sampler of some popular fountain pen user items that I have too much of.

I'm in the US and will mail to the US + these 180 countries [https://www.usps.com/international/first-class-mail-international.htm](https://www.usps.com/international/first-class-mail-international.htm) in a regular paper envelope. No tracking or guarantees. There is a chance that your envelope will never arrive. Please submit a request only if you are a generally decent person (honor system + karma score) and aren't brand new on Reddit.

This is 100% free and limited to 20 requests (more if some items aren't popular and I have leftovers), but if anyone wants to buy me a stamp, a coffee, or a fine nib Pelikan Souverän M400, message me for my email. If I get enough donations and interest and nobody frightens me, I may repeat the giveaway or some variation of it.

Maybe others with too much stuff but a lot of envelopes and a little spare time could do this too! It could become a new tradition.

**Instructions**

Required: Chat or message me your NAME and ADDRESS exactly as I should write it on the envelope using English letters as much as you can. If this is not possible, I will try to print it off what you wrote but include your country in English, at least.

Required: Specify what you want:

1. Shim
2. O-rings (2)
3. Paper
4. Handwritten letter from me on the safe-for-work topic of your choice, preferably one that won't get me arrested. Warning: Handwriting will be extremely bad.
5. All of the above

Optional: Leave a brief (or long) comment on where you are in your journey in this hobby

First come, first serve. I will send the letter within the next week or two and let you know when it's sent.

**Items**

*Brass shim 1.2 x 1.2 inches, cut off a brass sheet roll, 0.002 inch thickness (one piece, very flexible)*

These are indispensable and one shim lasts a long time because you can trim them as the edges get damaged. They clear out lint, fix flow issues, and gently open overly tight tines without scratching the nib. While I'm no expert, in my experience, 80% of new nib issues can be fixed with a good flossing. If you have not used one before, please look up posts on here or on YouTube to ensure that you don't cause damage to your nibs. Advanced use of the shim includes cutting off thin strips to use as pulls to open up or straighten tines (but be very careful!). These run on the thin side and are safer, some thicker shims available out there are better for more aggressive adjustments but these aren't that.

*Tomoe River FP 52 gsm loose A4 sheet (8.27 x 11.7 inches), white (one sheet, folded up)*

This is new stock, not the beloved old stock. This paper is widely recommended as an excellent way to show off sheen and shimmer and is the paper used in Hobonichi notebooks. I'll send a folded sheet of this for you to try out before you decide if you want to invest in a pack of your own. Personally, I don't like the paper's slick and plasticky hand feel, but I find it indispensable for swatching fancy inks. If I run out of the A4 I will substitute a couple A5.

*O-rings (2) black nitrile rubber 1mm wire diameter, 9mm outer diameter* 

These stretchy rings can be used in a Platinum Preppy and other similar sized pens to do an eyedropper conversion if used with some silicone lubricant. Please research this as I absolutely will not be held responsible for your ruined pants if you do this wrong or try this on a pen with holes (like the Kakuno). You can usually find lubricant from a hardware store or some TWSBI pens even come with some. I have not actually done this myself because I realized that I never want that much ink at one time and the burping stories made me wary. There's a good primer here:  [https://www.jetpens.com/blog/How-to-Do-an-Eyedropper-Pen-Conversion/pt/308](https://www.jetpens.com/blog/How-to-Do-an-Eyedropper-Pen-Conversion/pt/308)

1jcryun,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChristianDating/comments/1jcryun/question_for_my_family_in_christ/,Question for my family in Christ,"How did you find the balance between the “nice” vs “mean” Christian girl? 

My whole life I had been that “mean” Christian girl for the wrong reasons. My heart is the right place now and my identity comes from Christ alone but I’m still struggling to find who I am within that guard rail. Sometimes, it feels like I have to redeem myself for my previously bad behaviour but other times i feel like “no I don’t even have to”. I feel like a lot of it stems from insecurities and I just have to work on it daily. 

Mean Christian girl: Disguised in a confident shell of sarcasm, coffee, and a theology book is the girl we all long to be friends with. She is the perfect combination of fun, sass, and culture, with a sweet undertone of cliche Christian sayings. She overshares a bit, but it’s okay because she is praying for the person. She flips between friends because, truth be told, there is always a better option out there and it’s not in her interest to be a “people pleaser”.
Source: https://becomingme.tv/i-was-becoming-a-christian-mean-girl-and-i-dont-like-it/ 

Nice Christian girl: Typically, we’re polite. We avoid profanity. We usually don’t fight others with our fists. We avoid getting caught gossiping. Christian women are stereotypically, at least superficially, nice. And while being a “nice girl” might have once been desirable (possibly in the 1950s to distinguish one’s self from “bad” girls, like Rizzo from Broadway’s Grease), today it suggests someone without much spark. Someone who avoids confrontation. Who won’t ruffle feathers. Who doesn’t take risks. Who prioritizes “polite” over “right.”

We decided to meet at 6 PM. She was coming by metro and getting off at Burdi station, where I’d pick her up. When I got there, she messaged me saying there was an emergency—her friend had fainted, and she asked me to wait for another 30 minutes. Naturally, I was skeptical and thought, ""Alright, she’s probably going to bail on me.""

To kill time, I went to a nearby cafe (C7) to have a coffee alone, feeling pretty down about the whole situation. After 30 minutes, I gave her a call, and she said it’d be another 30 minutes before she could make it. At this point, I was about 90% sure I was being ghosted, but I figured I’d take the chance and wait it out.

And you know what? She actually showed up! I was genuinely happy, and we had a fantastic time together. She was super sweet, and we had a lot of fun. We even decided to meet again soon!

1jcrxw0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jcrxw0/i_have_a_temper_from_hell/,I have a temper from hell,"I'm an extremely angry person. No one I know would ever guess this about me, because I never explode with rage *when people are around*. 

I read a book some time ago about abusive and manipulative men and how they treat their partners (*Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft), and even though I'm not a man in a relationship and I don't abuse others, I could relate to what the author wrote about explosive rage. Lundy wrote that abusive men often claim that they can't control themselves when they lose their tempers, yet they conveniently never (or rarely) have violent temper tantrums in front of other men, in front of their bosses at work, or in front of police or other figures of authority, because, despite how they might feel in the moment, they are actually selective when it comes to the targets of their outbursts. 

When I am already in a bad mood, for whatever reason, and something happens (usually a technical failure, like my phone bugging out when I'm trying to type something) that triggers my rage, I feel like I lose my mind and can't control my anger. But this can't be true if I'm always able to control my emotions when I'm in the presence of coworkers, family, friends, or strangers. 

Today, I woke up naturally after just a few hours of sleep, and I was in a bad mood immediately because there are a few minor things going on in my life that are causing me stress. 

I have a fairly new espresso machine and I won't go into it, but in short, I had some problems with the machine, my coffee turned out bad, I tried to knock the coffee puck into the knockbox and coffee grounds flew all over the sink and counter, which caused me to blow a fuse and throw my portafilter across my dining room floor, like an absolute moron. 

I gasped as I helplessly watched the portafilter bounce on the rug under my table and fly into my window, where my blinds mercifully softened the impact and prevented the glass from shattering. 

At that point, I said to myself, I'm done. I am going back to bed. But I'm caffeinated (from the terrible coffee I made) and wide awake, and I'm beating myself up because I know this is no way to live. I cannot keep having these fits of rage. I don't want to have a heart attack when I'm 50. I don't want my anger to grow to the point where I might hurt someone or hurt myself. 

I know that therapy might help, but the cynic in me says that it will be a waste of time because I already know the advice they'll give: the breathing exercises, recognizing the triggers, using a pillow or a ball or something as a safer target, exercising, eating and sleeping better, writing my thoughts in a journal, keeping a notepad for angry scribbles... How can I take action to prevent my tantrums when they happen so fast that I feel like I'm not even thinking in the moment?

Is there really any hope for hotheads like me, or is this just my personality?

I realized caffeine did help me focus, but it also helped me focus on things that annoy me. So much easier now to just let the minor things go. Makes me wonder if this is a larger societal problem. Or maybe I'm just predisposed to crankiness. Oh and in case you're a long time caffeine consumer and you think you can't quit? I'd been drinking it for over 40 years.

Sorry for the long post, but I request your attention as frankly I don't have anywhere else to go now. Please also excuse any technical/clinical terms that I got wrong -- I did my best to educate myself about them and learning something new each day.

I am 31 and my wife is 27, from Coimbatore, India. Let me present a brief timeline of things:

* Tried naturally for 6-7 months
* Performed couple of follicle studies. Follicles showed normal count (2-3) and growth (\~18mm).
* Did my sperm tests - results all normal (55% normal motility, 60% normal morphology). Dr said nothing to worry here
* Gynec A (who has a simple maternity home and not an IVF clinic) suggested doing a laproscopy to check things as infertility was unexplained.
* After doing so, endometriosis was detected, with endometrium making things difficult, blocked L tube, and adherent R ovary.
* Wife was on Lupron Depot injections for 3 months, which helped with endometriosis (reduced her period pains by a lot).
* Thereafter , did HSG and found that one tube is patent and one blocked. Dr suggested to immediately go for IUI.
* Did 2xIUI, no results.
* Gynec A stopped practice due to personal issues, had to rely on another gynec B, who has a hospital as well as an IVF center.
* As a preparation for IVF, did all sorts of tests (AMH, E2, all sorts of STIs and diseases, diabetes, etc) -- all came perfectly normal.
* Wife took stimulation injections for a week. Post that, only three eggs were detected.
* Did ovum pickup - three mature eggs were found. They were taken forward for fertilization and further procedure.

\----

Now here's where the fishy part (according to me) starts:

* We were informed that both the eggs fertilized but did not grow due to something called ""embryo arrest"". As a result, all the effort and money spent till now is of no use. When asked about the cause for this, the embryologist gave vague answers.
* We were put on medications and told to take a break for one month, to improve sperm and egg quality.
* When we visited for an interim sperm test as prescribed, a DFI test was carried out. The DFI came to 55, which is quite high. The semen parameters were also poor, and showed teratozoospermia, which was a stark contrast compared to my last semen test a year ago which I described above. After the last test, my lifestyle had only improved, so I was shocked. On consulting with the embryologist, suddenly, the whole focus shifted from my wife's endometriosis to my sperm quality. She told me to:
   * Completely stop eating spicy food of any kind (I rarely do anyway)
   * Completely stop sugar, tea and coffee (I used to have couple of cups daily)
   * Eat only boiled food. ?!
   * Exercise daily (which I am doing since 6-7 months, and have lost almost 10kg weight). But on telling her this, I was told to exercise even more vigorously.
   * Take appropriate sleep (understandable, but my sleep was not all that irregular).
   * Most importantly the thing which can't be measured at all ""don't take stress"".'
   * **She also claimed that DFI can improve in a matter of couple of weeks.**
* Also, when we got the embryology report for the last IVF cycle, it shows ""fertilization failure"", contrary to ""embryo arrest"" which we were told verbally. On asking them about this, they said a lot of things, but what I understood was that these two are basically the same things and ""that's what they've to put on the written report"".
* No special medicines were prescribed for me to respond to this adverse report, just the CoQ10 tablets which were going on anyway, no medication was changed for my wife as well.
* Gynec also prescribed the same diet and lifestyle changes that we're frankly tired of hearing now, and which can't be really measured and makes finger pointing easy. We have been leading a very healthy lifestyle with proper exercise and diet, for many months now.

\----

Questions lingering in my mind right now:

* How did my sperm count fall so much, with no apparent reason (on asking the same to the embryologist, she gave vague, abstract answers with no clear direction. She also mentioned that maybe I ate spicy food just before the test. Frankly this seemed outrageous to me). Can sperm DFI results be misreported on purpose?
* **If DFI test was so important, why was it done** ***after*** **the IVF pickup? Couldn't we have skipped the entire process, seeing that my DFI was so high?**
* Do we just expect the DFI to improve in a couple of weeks by doing lifestyle changes?

**Based on multiple interactions with the staff at Gynec B, they seem fishy and their demeanor is also quite cold, emotionless. Based on the description above, could we be getting scammed and doing unnecessary IVF cycles?**

We are currently getting ready for another round, and I would highly appreciate any input from experienced people, medical professionals.",0,1742149007.0,IVF,2,0.4,False

How's it going everyone?!

My wife and I (both 30) recently realized that we'd love to expand our social circle and meet new, like-minded friends in and around the area. Would love to connect with other people who share similar interests and just enjoy good company!  

We’re both into:  

Music – Whether it’s discovering new artists, attending live concerts (Recently saw Coldplay! Was lovely :)), or just chilling with a great playlist! From classic rock, hip hop, house/electronic to old school Hindi tracks!

Restaurants & Bars – We love exploring new places to eat and drink, from hole-in-the-wall gems to fancy spots with great vibes. Love Thai, Japanese, Indian, Italian !

Board Games – Always up for a fun board game night!  Be it Uno, Cards against Humanity, Jenga, Monopoly or anything else!

Traveling – Exploring new destinations in & around Mumbai/Thane, within India or out of India! Exploring new cultures to trying different local food items! (Just came back from Maldives & it was truly a gem of a place!)

Fitness – Love hitting the gym & running! Looking to also get into calisthenics, yoga & rock climbing. 

P.S : : Love dogs, petting them, giving them treats, booping their noses, you name it! Our lil ones are well loved!

I work in the healthcare industry and my wife is in the design industry! We’re located in Hiranandani estate and are easy going people and always up for good conversations over coffee, drinks, or a nice meal! Whether you're an individual or a couple looking to genuinely make friends, feel free to reach out! Would love to meet new people and build some genuine friendships!

1jcrrsv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jcrrsv,"Astra Teaser, what I noticed","My explanation on the Ridu Holidays Teaser

1- Reference to “Roman Holiday”. A movie where a normal reporter gets an opportunity to shoot and interview a princess in Rome. The princess finds the situation amusing and wants to escape the busy schedule she’s always in with the reporter, like Astra. They use antique cameras for the trailer, possibly a reference to the movie. 

2- Another reference from the movie. Astra quickly shows a thing of interest of her own, the coffee shop. 

3- Wise glances at Astra’s lips before quickly moving back up and composing himself.

4- Meteor showers are very sacred for couples to observe in Chinese culture, we see a few couples throughout the teaser, one looking particularly like Wise. 

5- Excuse the quality, but the news reports say this is a mysterious meteor shower out of nowhere, meaning Astra did indeed put on a show for Wise and was not planned by her team, possibly in reference to the “Even bigger gift” she promised him at the end of her special episode, with a much more flirty and excited tone compared to if you play Belle. 

6- Further exemplifying number 5 and a reference between the princess of the movie and Astra’s own personality of being herself and running away from her schedule, just to be with someone pretty ordinary and chill, like how the princess caught on in the movie for the normal reporter.

But now I see the one at Sask Drive and Albert Street is also closed! 

This franchise seems to be taking it hard! Which sucks because I really love their coffee.

I think all we have left now is the two at RGH, one at the Pasqua, the one on Rochdale, and I think there’s one at the university, although I’ve never been there.

\- I understand many of your customers are Karen’s, but I’m seeing more and more baristas that think they are working bottle service at a popular club. Lots of attitude, and given that Starbucks pays more than other places like Dunkin, I simply don’t understand. Train your staff to make drinks the way they should, and yes, that means stirring my traditional drink such as a Cafe Mocha so I don’t end up with all the syrup on the bottom when I pay $7 for a drink. Big noticeable decline in customer service, but of course there are still many exceptional employees. 

  
\- Introduce self service kiosks for those that get regular black coffee, especially in high volume locations. I suppose online ordering would do the trick, but in the morning, if I just want a black Pike, put a vending version of the new drip machines you just put behind the counter!

  
You’re no longer a “premium” experience, and often I find it better just going to Dunkin, and if there is an Einstein Bros nearby when I’m traveling, I wouldn’t even consider Starbucks. Your stock has fallen significantly in my eyes, and can’t believe that I’m in the minority. ",0,1742148836.0,starbucks,11,0.32,False

Coffee wasnt good for me. It wasnt working. Chamomile worked. My brain was so happy then, like I wasnt sad I wasnt paranoid. I needed that black pepper. 

Life is good, I took a hot bath and I feel safe and rested. This weeken was the best. I see my body has to eat and rest. 

Watched a cowboy movie and I felt the passion was enough irl its not there so what I hype up by long showers and hot soups.",3,1742148782.0,PMDD,0,0.81,False
