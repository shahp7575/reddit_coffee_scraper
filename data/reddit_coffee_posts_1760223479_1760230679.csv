1o4br4y,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1o4br4y/i_dont_understand_anything_anymore_she_want_to/,"I don't understand anything anymore, she want to have a child? Help me","I need to tell someone, because dealing with all of this alone has been too much. I honestly feel lost.

We broke up a year ago, but she was always an emotional rollercoaster. One of the reasons we ended things was because she would literally give me gifts, thoughtful stuff, things that showed care, and just a few hours later say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you think we should break up?‚Äù I was completely confused. I never knew if she loved me, if I did something wrong, or if it was all just manipulation. Getting something nice and then being rejected right after messes with your head.

I used to beg her to go out, to see me. She‚Äôd always cancel last minute or act like she didn‚Äôt really want to be there. When I finally ended it, she said I was the one who used her. A few days later, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about it. Something didn‚Äôt feel right. So I downloaded a dating app, and there she was. Her profile was already there, which made me think she‚Äôd been using it even before our breakup. When I confronted her, she said she was looking for her friend‚Äôs ex.

After a year with no contact, she came back, same strange behavior all over again. She‚Äôd ask me for random favors, like bringing her coffee at work. And if I said no, she‚Äôd reply, ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs fine, my friend will bring it.‚Äù It made me feel completely replaceable, like nothing I did ever mattered. Every favor just pulled me back in, made me more confused. I kept asking myself if it was love or just another game she was playing. She‚Äôd ask for sweets, toys, little gifts, and then, out of nowhere, she said she wanted to have kids.

She came over one night while I was drunk, almost something happened, and two days later she told me, ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt force you to have kids, but I could poke a hole in the condom.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt even know how to react. I just froze. I didn‚Äôt know if I should laugh, cry, or just disappear.

She‚Äôd make plans with me and cancel minutes before. On the same day she said she was going out drinking with another guy, she sent me a picture of herself at home. She‚Äôd tell me, ‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt work,‚Äù and then the next day say, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs now or never. If we don‚Äôt get back together, someone might ask me out this week.‚Äù

I was completely lost, not knowing what was real, what was manipulation, or if any of it would ever stop.

If anyone‚Äôs ever gone through something like this, I‚Äôd really like to hear from you. Being alone, with your head full of mixed feelings and doubts, it‚Äôs really hard to know where to go or what to do.

TL;DR: She manipulated me for over a year with gifts, mixed signals, random favors, and almost tricked me into having kids. I‚Äôm completely lost and confused. Am I overreacting for cutting her off completely?",1,1760230330.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False
1o4bpm6,https://i.redd.it/ywnrape4wkuf1.jpeg,Day 11: Doctor,"Fight after fight, blood and teeth lost in the arena's sandy ground, fighters slumping and falling down when they can‚Äôt keep on fighting. On this night it isn‚Äôt so different, as a fighter's last sight was of him slowly falling to the sandy ground, bloody and beaten.

As gloves slid on with tools laid out on a cold plate, the body rolled onto the table without a faint sense of awareness. It‚Äôs another night for a particular coffee fueled doctor that legally cannot call herself a doctor.

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs hope he won‚Äôt wake up mid operation this time.‚Äù

1o4bpci,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1o4bpci/sage_bambino_vs_bambino_plus_300/,Sage Bambino vs Bambino Plus [$300],"I know this question has been asked many times in this sub, but I believe my situation is a bit different, so I‚Äôd appreciate your 2 cents.

I live in Europe, where the Bambino is priced at ‚Ç¨350 and the Bambino Plus at ‚Ç¨530. Honestly, I can‚Äôt afford either at full price, I‚Äôm actually looking for something under ‚Ç¨300. Luckily, through my corporate benefits, I can get the Bambino for ‚Ç¨245 and the Bambino Plus for ‚Ç¨370. At ‚Ç¨245, the Bambino is within reach for me.

A bit about my situation: I‚Äôve been living with my boyfriend for the past 8 months, but I‚Äôm now getting my own place for personal growth reasons. He has an old DeLonghi single-boiler machine with a modded steam wand (3-hole), and we both love coffee. We usually drink 1‚Äì2 cups a day. I love caf√© lattes.

Here‚Äôs the thing: I love latte art and creamy milk texture, but I just¬†*can‚Äôt*¬†froth milk to save my life. I‚Äôve been practicing for 8 months and still struggle to get good microfoam. It always turns out more like cappuccino foam. So having a machine that makes milk frothing easier would really make a difference for me.

The secondhand market here (especially on Kleinanzeigen) is CRAZZY. People are asking over ‚Ç¨300 for 4 year old Bambino/Plus machines. And there are no reliable refurbished options in stock at the moment. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm hesitant to buy used, especially when I can get these first-hand prices with my discounts.

Do I just go with the Bambino for ‚Ç¨245 and try to keep improving my frothing skills manually? Do I wait out and hope the Bambino Plus drops below ‚Ç¨300 during Black Friday (if that even happens in Germany)? Or should I be looking at another machine altogether?

So, for this funny case I picked out 4 from each (Gerson for 64, Surge for Melee, Joker for Brawl, and Trip for Sm4sh)

Rules|

1: characters have to be created after 64's release (January 21st 1999). |

2: 1 optional IRL character per roster (debut not created)

3: But no IRL politics. |

4: Anime is allowed|

5: (can't believe I'm saying it but) actual sentient characters only. (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

6: characters that people know, people like a random person who isn't named enjoying a coffee and is never shown again won't count (blame PMK-3 for me establishing this rule) |

7: don't downvote, if you see a submission you don't like, ignore it, don't downvote it. |

I usually add the character at around 7:00 PM (in Massachusetts time) (or 1 hour before I post)|

If a tie happens I'll have to consult.... The Wheel. |

He who joins the roster, like myself, he won't be able to suggest any other character because he in turn becomes the character. |",1,1760229584.0,SmashBrosRosters,1,1.0,False

1o4bgup,https://www.reddit.com/r/GERD/comments/1o4bgup/drink_alternatives_for_soda_that_arent_water/,drink alternatives for soda that aren't water?,"so my GERD has recently gotten worse. for reference i'm 25 and, despite knowing this runs in my family and having sporadic problems with it growing up, i've been mainlining soda and spicy chips since highschool and it seems like i'm finally encountering some pushback from my body from it. i used to only drink soda with the occasional coffee until one time i got BAD strep throat and it hurt to drink anything but water, so for about two weeks i broke my reliance on soda and made water my main drink throughout the day, dropping down to drinking one regular-sized can of soda a day. i had noticed while i was recovering from being sick that not drinking soda drastically reduced my anxiety attacks as well, so that made it even easier.

i've been sticking to that system with the exception of having a 7oz can of soda at work for lunch, for about a year or two now i wanna say. at the beginning of october i got really sick (high fever, had to call out of work) that coincided with a really bad GERD episode; i could hardly eat for 2 days. i figured that was because i was drinking my soda + was in a hot chip phase + i've been drinking a lot of seasonal coffee since pumpkin spice coffee is one of my favs and i only get it for like 2 months so i was drinking one a day. after i got better i cut out the hot chips permanently and everything seemed fine, but yesterday i had a burger for dinner and a big soda from the restaurant because i occaisonally get a drink when we order takeout (which is normally only once or twice a week) and i don't know if it was the soda or the burger that got me but i was up a couple hours past my bedtime with bad reflux. thankfully it went away but i'm thinking that soda is the problem here.

i need an alternative to soda that i can drink frequently without upsetting my stomach that isn't water, because water is too bland and it's what drives me to soda in the first place. i still plan to drink mostly water but i need a flavorful drink as well. i've tried tea before with no success because even herbal is too bitter and ""tea-tasting"" for me, if that makes sense. i'm gonna keep trying different flavors (there's a website that sells sampler sizes for cheap that i've been looking into) but does anyone have any other ideas for a drink that won't upset my stomach? something that isn't carbonated and probably nothing overly sweet as well? thank you in advance!",0,1760229475.0,GERD,1,0.5,False
1o4bghu,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1o4bghu/dear/,"Dear,","Do you think you‚Äôd know what loving me is like? 


What about, what me loving you would look like? 


Do you think you would know the difference in me- between loving you and being in love with you? 


Gods, you don‚Äôt know, do you? 


That‚Äôs alright. Let me explain it. 

Loving you is accepting all the pieces of you‚Äî sewn back together from every destructive thing that ever happened to you. 


It‚Äôs the choice to be kind in the moment and patient when the world becomes too much. It‚Äôs quiet affirmation that you are still worthy of love by my choosing to stay. To say your name so you may understand that you are worthy of love. No matter how dirty or ruined you feel. 


I love this way because no one loved me, affirmed me, or took care of me this way. And it was by being there for myself, I learned to be who I am. 


In love with you‚Ä¶ 


I‚Äôd bend the world in every kiss, I‚Äôd touch every stitch holding you together and wrap it around my hand to unravel and unveil your beautiful madness, and I‚Äôd change it so you‚Äôd see more closing your eyes than staring at this ugly world. 


It wouldn‚Äôt be a chore, obligation, or job to be in love with you. It‚Äôd be a privilege, the reward for living through my hell, and the one thing I‚Äôd always prioritize. Toast in bed, tea and coffee, cookies, and the best homemade cooking. You‚Äôd be worthy of all my effort. 


The nights would mean more than stars, the air would have more purpose than filling our lungs, and sleep would be our time travel to the next day. 


I‚Äôve loved. But I haven‚Äôt been in love in a long time. I was married once. As poorly as it ended, I was in love and never stopped fighting for it. Even in the end. 


I fear I will never be in love again‚Ä¶ what makes you think‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd do it again or that you‚Äôd be worthy of that? Prove me wrong or don‚Äôt. Being alone is worth the misery of the wrong partner. I would know. 



With love,


Keeper

Now in the beginning year 1 he use to spend all his time on tik tok following women. One day he went to work and literally followed 20 women. I went to him and talked about how it made feel uncomfortable. He think are insecure etc. but it‚Äôs not that. It the fact that he completely ignores me when I try to have. Conversation with him and he dose hear a thing . I ask him if h wants to watch a movie ‚Äúit looks stupid‚Äù.


So moving forward two kid later all he does is watch tik tok videos. Not only that he has called me ugly and for what it‚Äôs worth it was when we were arguing and he said it with whole chest repeatedly. My husband also came up with 2500 on a truck that note is 800 not including insurance. Now we are struggling with food and diapers etc.. my income is unstable no money for daycare and or family.  Before he purchased the truck I told him to let me get a job first. He ran to his mama who told him ‚Äú yea go ahead and buy it‚Äù. This is relevant because he started struggle with the bills and treated me so bad the insults and the cold shoulder was at an all time high.

I just started working and now his attitude has changed. He is a lot nicer. But still watches his tik tok videos etc. 

When I was single I didn‚Äôt struggle this bad financially and I damn don‚Äôt feel so unstable. 
I stayed because of the kids and he isn‚Äôt such a bad person but I feel like staying I won‚Äôt have any joy or happiness. I‚Äôm not talking about gifts or trips. I mean waking up and having a good convo over coffee. After a long day of work someone to talk to. On the weekends we can find something to watch together. We can take the kids to the park. 

I regret getting married it‚Äôs so fringing an exhausting. I never imagined marriage to be like this. I knew marriage was hard work but it‚Äôs too much. 

Should I just stay put and continue to work at it. 
Should I walk away? Oh I have talked to him he gives silent treatment I suggested marriage counseling he won‚Äôt he‚Äôs perfect he say ‚Äú you know how many women would love to be in your position.‚Äù ",3,1760229372.0,Marriage,5,0.8,False

It was meant to be a kid‚Äôs party, but there were basically no kids. Just my wife‚Äôs young niece.

From the start, things felt off. L‚Äôs dad (the grandpa) was there, first time meeting him as a couple. My wife caught up with him but didn‚Äôt even introduce me. Later I overheard him quietly asking his wife who I was because my wife never introduced me. That was awkward.

At her friends‚Äô table, she kept ignoring me. I don‚Äôt know if it was the music or the distraction of watching her niece, but it was like I didn‚Äôt exist. I called her out on it; she said she couldn‚Äôt hear me. I told her it‚Äôs hard to hear me when she never even looks at me.

When the kids‚Äô games started, there were no kids to play. My wife‚Äôs friends volunteered so the organizer wouldn‚Äôt be embarrassed, and they pulled me in too. I joined despite feeling mentally off and disconnected. I have diagnosed depression and anxiety; I take antidepressants and rely on caffeine to stay functional. Her friends know this and were actually kind and supportive, but my wife seemed oblivious.

After the party, the group decided to hit a shoe store, then a coffee shop. I was already low-energy and irritated, but I thought it would be a nice adult hangout after babysitting duty. I told my wife to ask her brother to pick up his daughter before we left. She said she‚Äôd just keep watching the kid.

On the way to the store, I told her I needed coffee badly. She brushed me off, saying we‚Äôd get some later. At the store, she focused entirely on the kid again, so I sat by myself playing on my phone. She finally asked if I was okay, and I just said, ‚ÄúDoes it even matter?‚Äù

When we got to the coffee shop, her friend asked who wanted to come order. I volunteered, and my wife suddenly asked why I wasn‚Äôt asking her what she wanted. She refused to come with me because she was busy with the kid. I insisted she come, and she reluctantly did.

When I finally got caffeine, I felt like myself again. I loosened up, joked around, and actually enjoyed the rest of the time. One friend asked if her brother was picking up the kid soon; thankfully, he did. I felt instant relief when the niece left. I just wanted time alone with my wife and her friends.

We got back to her parents‚Äô place, where we were staying overnight. Our usual routine is to talk before bed and resolve the day. Instead, her brother asked her to babysit again, and she agreed, retreating into the niece's room. I felt ignored again, and it didn‚Äôt seem like she wanted nor cared to talk anyway. So I chatted with her via Messenger (to also remind her) that I wasn‚Äôt in the right headspace anymore to talk about what happened and would rather discuss things tomorrow. She just replied, ‚ÄúDo I sleep with you or in the other room?‚Äù

That floored me. After five years together, she still had to ask? I told her I was tired of having to re-explain who I am and how I function. She could decide based on what she already knew about me. She chose to sleep in the other room.

I woke up feeling completely disconnected. I don‚Äôt even recognize how she‚Äôs been acting lately.

I‚Äôm at that weird intersection of wanting a connection that feels effortless but also a little electric. You know, the kind where you can joke about the world falling apart one minute and get a random ‚ÄúI miss you‚Äù the next.

I‚Äôm 25, somewhere in the EU, running mostly on sarcasm, curiosity, and bad coffee. I like people who can hold a conversation and hold their own in a bit of playful chaos and flirty, smart, slightly unhinged, and emotionally aware. If you can banter, tease, overshare about your day, and also spiral into some deep talk about life, we‚Äôll get along great.

I love sports, movies, shows, music, and books ‚Ä¶ basically anything that tells a good story. Bonus points if you can recommend something that wrecked you emotionally or made you laugh so hard you choked on water. I‚Äôm also a sucker for wit, voice notes, and people who give attention. 

Not looking for anything forced. Just something real, where we can be our weird, funny, chaotic selves. If we click, maybe it becomes one of those connections that just‚Ä¶ fits.

So yeah if you‚Äôre funny, warm, and a bit of a smartass too, slide in. I promise to keep it interesting.

1o4bawm,https://i.redd.it/ccfcp1xhskuf1.jpeg,"Discarded Love, Found Happiness (looking for free link)","I stood just outside the glass patio doors, holding a tray of fresh towels. Tonight was a celebration of Coleton B*rron's full recovery, the tech world's golden boy back on his feet after three years of my dedicated physical therapy.

But then, his ex-girlfriend, Charly Mack, appeared. When a stray splash from the pool hit her dress, Coleton shoved me aside to protect her, sending me headfirst into the concrete edge of the pool.

I woke up in the hospital with a concussion, only to see Coleton comforting Charly, who was faking tears. He didn't defend me when she claimed we were""just friends."" His mother, Esther Cotton, then sent me a text with a five-million-dollar check, telling me I didn't fit into his world.

Back at his penthouse, Charly accused me of poisoning Coleton with soup and breaking his father's cherished wooden box. He believed her, forcing me to drink the soup and leaving me to collapse on the kitchen floor. I ended up in the hospital again, alone.

I didn't understand why he would believe her lies, why he would hurt me after everything I had done. Why was I just a temporary fix, easily discarded?

On his birthday, I left him a text:""Happy Birthday, Coleton. I'm leaving. Don't look for me. Goodbye."" I turned off my phone, dropped it in a tr**h can, and walked toward a new life.


Chapter 1
The party was in full swing, the sound of laughter and splashing water spilling out from the brightly lit backyard. I stood just outside the glass patio doors, holding a tray of fresh towels. It was for Coleton Barron. Everything had been for him for the last three years.

Tonight was a celebration of his full recovery. The tech world's golden boy was back on his feet, and his friends were here to welcome him. I should have been happy, but a knot of anxiety tightened in my stomach. I just needed to hear him say it.

""Man, I can't believe you're walking again,"" I heard Jaydan Ferguson, one of Coleton's closest friends, say. ""It's a miracle."" 

Isaias Skinner clapped Coleton on the back. ""It's not a miracle, it's Arminda. She's the real MVP. Three years, man. She never gave up on you."" 

A flicker of warmth spread through me. They saw it. They saw everything I had done. Maybe... maybe tonight was the night.

Jaydan raised his beer bottle. ""Seriously, Coleton. She's a keeper. So, now that you're back on your feet, when's the wedding?"" 

The air went still. The friendly chatter died down, and all I could hear was the gentle lapping of water in the pool. I held my breath, my heart pounding against my ribs. This was it.

Coleton let out a soft laugh. It was a sound I knew better than my own name.

""Arminda?"" he said, his voice smooth and casual. ""She's a great friend. The best physical therapist a guy could ask for."" 

He paused, taking a slow sip of his beer.

""That's all."" 

The words hit me. Friend. Just a friend. My breath hitched, and the tray of towels suddenly felt a hundred pounds heavier. The warm night air turned cold, and a chill seeped into my bones.

""What do you mean, 'that's all'?"" Jaydan pressed, his voice laced with confusion. ""Charly Mack ditched you the second you got hurt. Arminda was the one who stayed."" 

Coleton's face darkened at the mention of Charly's name. ""Don't talk about her like that."" 

""Why not? It's the truth,"" Isaias chimed in. ""She couldn't handle you in a wheelchair, so she took off. Arminda was the one changing your bandages, helping you learn to walk again, dealing with you when you were at your worst."" 

I stood frozen, hidden by the shadows. The scenes of the past three years flashed through my mind like a movie reel.

Coleton Barron, the tech prodigy, had it all. Then, a horrific car crash shattered his legs and his world. He was confined to a wheelchair, his career on hold, his future uncertain. Charly Mack, his glamorous girlfriend, took one look at his new reality and walked away without a backward glance.

That was when I stepped in. As his physical therapist, my job was to help him heal his body. But it became so much more. I pushed him when he wanted to give up. I held him when he cried in frustration. I celebrated every tiny victory, every painful step. I put my own life on hold, dedicating every waking moment to his recovery.

Everyone assumed we would be together. His mother, Esther Cotton, had tolerated my presence as a necessity. His friends treated me like one of the family. And I had let myself believe it, too. I had fallen in love with the broken man, and I thought he had, too.

But now, he was whole again. Standing tall, the charismatic man he used to be. And I was just the physical therapist. Just a friend. He was no longer the man who needed me.

I pushed the door open, forcing a smile onto my face. ""Towels are here."" 

The tension broke, but the atmosphere was thick with unspoken words. Coleton wouldn't meet my eyes. He just took a towel and turned away.

Just then, a new voice cut through the awkward silence.

""Coleton, darling!"" 

My head snapped up. There, walking toward us with a practiced, delicate sway, was Charly Mack. She was dressed in a stunning white dress, looking every bit the socialite she was.

""Charly?"" Coleton breathed, his eyes wide with disbelief and something else... something that looked a lot like longing.

""I heard you were better,"" she said, her voice a soft purr. ""I had to come see for myself."" 

Jaydan and Isaias exchanged a dark look. They remembered how she had abandoned him. But Coleton seemed to have forgotten. He was captivated.

""You... you look amazing,"" he stammered.

Charly smiled, a picture of innocence. ""I've missed you."" 

The partygoers were in a water fight in the pool. A stray splash hit Charly's dress.

She let out a tiny shriek. ""Oh, my dress!"" 

Suddenly, someone in the pool lost their footing and flailed, accidentally knocking a large, heavy pool float toward Charly. It was moving fast.

""Charly, look out!"" Coleton yelled.

Without a second thought, he lunged forward, shoving me hard to the side to get to her. He wrapped his arms around Charly, pulling her out of the float's path.

I stumbled backward, my balance gone. My head hit the hard concrete edge of the pool with a sickening crack. Pain exploded behind my eyes, and the world tilted.

I fell into the water.

The last thing I saw before the darkness took over was Coleton cradling Charly in his arms, his face a mask of concern for her, not even glancing in my direction as I sank beneath the surface.

I remembered a time, a year ago, when I'd slipped while helping him transfer from his chair, badly spraining my wrist to break his fall. He had held my hand, his eyes full of gratitude.""I'll never forget this, Arminda,"" he had promised.""Never.""

The promise echoed in my mind, a bitter, hollow sound.

He was recovered now. He didn't need me anymore.

As my friends pulled me from the water, my phone, lying on a nearby table, buzzed. It was a text from his mother, Esther Cotton.

""Arminda, Coleton is back on his feet. You've done your job well. Here is a check for five million dollars. It's time for you to leave. You don't fit into his world."" 

I closed my eyes, the pain in my head nothing compared to the pain in my heart.

Fine. I'll leave.


Chapter 2
The hospital lights were too bright, making the throbbing in my head worse. A doctor had put three stitches in my scalp and diagnosed me with a mild concussion. He told me to rest.

I walked out of the emergency room, my hand pressed to the bandage on my head. As I stepped outside into the cool night air, I saw them.

Coleton was standing by his car, his arm protectively around Charly Mack. Her face was buried in his ch**t, her shoulders shaking with soft sobs.

""I'm so sorry, Coleton,"" she cried, her voice muffled. ""I never should have left. I was just scared. I didn't know how to handle it. But I never stopped loving you."" 

It was a lie. A beautiful, well-crafted lie. I had seen her at parties over the years, laughing and drinking with other men, never once asking about Coleton's condition.

Coleton just held her tighter. ""It's okay, Charly. It's in the past."" 

He saw me then. His expression flickered with something-guilt, maybe-but it was gone in an instant.

""Arminda,"" he said, his voice strained. ""Are you okay?"" 

""I'm fine,"" I said, my own voice flat and empty.

Charly peeked at me from over his shoulder. ""Oh, Arminda, I'm so sorry. I hope you're not mad. Coleton and I... we have a lot of history."" She looked up at him with wide, innocent eyes. ""He told me you're just friends. I wouldn't want to get in the way of... anything."" 

Coleton didn't correct her. He didn't defend the three years I had given him. He just stood there, silent, his arms still wrapped around the woman who had abandoned him.

Charly's lips curved into a triumphant little smile, a smile only I could see.

I let out a short, bitter laugh. It was a sound that seemed to come from someone else.

""Don't worry,"" I said, looking directly at Coleton. ""You don't have to worry about me at all."" 

I turned and walked away, not looking back.

The next morning, I went to the hospital's administrative office. I had received a job offer months ago, from a prestigious rehabilitation clinic overseas. I had turned it down for Coleton. Now, I formally accepted it.

My flight was in two days.

I went back to the penthouse apartment Coleton owned, the place I had called home for three years. It was filled with memories, every corner holding an echo of our time together. The special railings in the bathroom, the ramp by the front door, the chairlift on the stairs. All things I had installed.

Methodically, I began to erase myself. I packed my clothes, my books, my toiletries. I took down the photos from the corkboard in the kitchen-pictures of his progress, of us laughing, of his first steps with the walker.

My fingers brushed against one particular photo. It was from a year ago, on his birthday. He was still in the wheelchair, but I had baked him a cake, and his friends had come over. In the picture, I was leaning down to light the candles, and he was looking up at me, a genuine, happy smile on his face. It was the smile that had made me fall in love.

With a deep breath, I took the photo and tore it into tiny pieces. I let them fall into the tr**h can like confetti.

It was over. I had to accept that.

My phone rang. It was Coleton.

""Hey, where are you?"" he asked, his voice casual, as if nothing had happened. ""I woke up and the house is empty. It's weird."" 

I closed my eyes. ""I had some things to do."" 

""Well, can you come by the office later? I have a board meeting, and I want you to check my posture. Make sure I look confident."" 

The request was so normal, so typical of the past three years. I was his physical therapist, his support system. His crutch.

""Okay,"" I said, my voice barely a wh**per.

I went to his company, Barron Tech. The sleek, modern building felt alien to me now. I found him in his corner office, staring out at the city skyline.

Charly was there, of course. She was perched on the edge of his desk, looking like she owned the place.

""Oh, Arminda, you're here,"" she said, her tone syrupy sweet. ""I brought Coleton some lunch. It's his favorite, from that little Italian place we used to go to."" She gestured to a container of rich, creamy pasta on his desk.

My stomach clenched. I had spent years meticulously planning his diet, ensuring he ate healthy, low-inflammation foods to aid his recovery. That pasta was full of everything he wasn't supposed to eat.

""Coleton, you shouldn't have that,"" I said, my professional instincts taking over. ""It's too heavy. It will cause inflammation in your joints."" 

He waved his hand dismissively. ""I'm fine, Arminda. I'm not an invalid anymore. I can eat what I want."" 

He took a large bite of the pasta, mo**ing in pleasure. ""God, Charly, I've missed this."" 

The pain started in his stomach about twenty minutes later. He clutched his side, his face turning pale and sweaty. The rich food was too much for a system accustomed to a clean diet.

I said nothing. I just quietly placed a bottle of digestive enzymes and pain relievers on his desk.

Then, I turned and walked out of the office.

As the door closed behind me, I heard Charly's voice, sharp and mocking.

""She's just a glorified nurse, Coleton. Don't let her boss you around. She should be grateful you even let her stay this long."" 

I leaned against the wall in the hallway, the sound of her words echoing in my ears. But what hurt more was what I didn't hear. I didn't hear Coleton defend me. I didn't hear him say a single word.

That was when I knew, with absolute certainty, that he loved her. He loved her enough to let her poison him, to let her insult the woman who had saved his life. And I had been a fool to ever think otherwise.


Chapter 3
Coleton's face was ashen when I saw him later that evening. He was sitting on the sofa, clutching a pillow to his stomach.

""Did you take the medicine I left?"" I asked, keeping my voice neutral.

He nodded weakly. ""Yeah. I... I had to get my stomach pumped."" 

The words hung in the air. He had gone to the hospital, endured an invasive procedure, all because he didn't want to upset Charly by refusing the food she brought. The depth of his feeling for her was a physical blow.

I knelt to check the support brace on his ankle, a routine I had done a thousand times. As I adjusted the straps, the back of my hand brushed against the sharp edge of the coffee table, scraping the skin. A thin line of bl**d welled up. It was a small, st**id injury, but he didn't even notice. His focus was entirely on his own discomfort.

I finished with the brace and stood up. He leaned into me, resting his head on my shoulder. His body was tense with pain.

""Just rub my temples,"" he murmured. ""Like you used to."" 

I did as he asked, my fingers moving in slow, familiar circles. He sighed, his body relaxing against mine. For a moment, it was like old times. For a moment, I was his comfort, his safe place.

But the feeling was gone. I no longer craved this closeness. I felt nothing but a hollow ache.

He fell asleep, his breathing evening out. Carefully, I eased him back against the couch cushions, pulling a blanket over him.

Then, without a second glance, I walked out of the room.

The next day, he seemed to have forgotten the entire incident. He found me packing the last of my things into a suitcase.

""What are you doing?"" he asked, a frown creasing his brow.

""Packing,"" I said simply.

He didn't seem to process the finality of it. ""Oh. Well, listen, I need a favor. Charly's having a small gallery opening for her photography tonight. I need you to come with me."" 

I stared at him. ""Why?"" 

""She just got back to the country, you know? She doesn't have many friends here yet. I want to make sure she has a good turnout, make her feel supported."" He looked at me, his expression earnest. ""It would mean a lot to me."" 

I was just a prop. Someone to fill a seat and make his ex-girlfriend look popular. The irony was suffocating.

But I agreed. One last night. Then I would be gone.

At the gallery, Charly was in her element. She clung to Coleton's arm, a radiant smile on her face as she introduced him to everyone. He looked proud, basking in her reflected glory. He bought every single one of her photographs, a grand gesture that had the small crowd whispering.

Charly drifted over to me, a champagne flute in her hand. ""See?"" she purred, her eyes glittering with malice. ""He's mine. He was always mine. You were just a temporary fix. A placeholder."" 

I didn't say anything. There was nothing left to say.

Suddenly, a fire alarm blared, its shriek cutting through the polite chatter. A wisp of sm**e curled from a back room. Panic erupted. People started pushing toward the exit.

In the chaos, someone shoved me, and I twisted my ankle, a sharp, searing pain shooting up my leg. I cried out, stumbling against a wall.

I looked for Coleton. He was just a few feet away. Our eyes met for a fraction of a second.

Then he turned and ran, pushing against the tide of people, back into the gallery.

""Charly!"" he screamed, his voice raw with terror. ""Charly, where are you?"" 

He found her huddled in a corner, coughing from the sm**e. He scooped her up into his arms and carried her toward the exit, his face a mask of single-minded determination.

He ran right past me. He didn't see me slumped against the wall, my face pale with pain. He didn't see me at all.

As the sm**e thickened, my vision started to blur. The pain in my ankle was excruciating. I tried to stand, but the leg wouldn't hold my weight. I sank to the floor, my head swimming. The last thing I remembered was the sound of distant sirens.

I woke up in a hospital bed. Jaydan and Isaias were sitting by my side, their faces grim.

""He didn't even ask about you, Arminda,"" Jaydan said, his voice low and angry. ""The paramedics brought you in, and we called him. He said he was busy making sure Charly was okay. Her pristine dress got a little smudge of soot on it."" 

Isaias shook his head in disgust. ""He's lost his mind. This isn't the man we know."" 

""You need to leave him,"" Jaydan said, his eyes pleading. ""Please. You deserve so much better."" 

I looked down at the cast on my ankle. A clean break, the doctor had said.

""I am,"" I whispered. ""I'm leaving."" 

The door to the hospital room swung open. Coleton stood there, his hair disheveled, his eyes wild.

""Leaving?"" he said, his voice dangerously quiet. ""Where do you think you're going?""",2,1760228985.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1o4baia,https://youtu.be/vgAj3pqO5GE,4 Very Scary TRUE Halloween Road Trip Horror Stories,"# ""Help Wanted"":

My friend Anna and I had always talked about taking a big road trip together. We were both in our early twenties, fresh out of college, and we wanted to see more of the world before settling into jobs. That fall, we picked Australia because it seemed exotic and full of open spaces. We planned to drive from city to city, stopping at small towns, maybe finding some short-term work to stretch our money. Halloween was coming up, and we thought it would be fun to celebrate it somewhere remote, like at a farm or a quiet spot where we could have our own little party with costumes and stories around a fire. We packed our car with bags, snacks, and a couple of silly masks we bought at a discount store. Little did we know that trip would turn into something that still wakes me up at night.

We started in Sydney, driving north along the coast at first, then cutting inland toward the drier parts. The roads got emptier the farther we went, with long stretches where we saw no one. Anna drove most of the time because she liked being in control, and I handled the map and music. We laughed a lot, singing along to old songs and sharing secrets. After a week, our cash was running low, so we checked online ads for quick jobs. That's when we found the posting on a site like Gumtree. It said a family on a remote property needed help with household tasks. Free room and board, easy work, perfect for backpackers. The ad mentioned it was for one person, but when I called the number, the woman on the phone said her neighbors could use an extra hand too. Her voice was soft, almost shy. ""You and your friend can both come,"" she said. ""My husband can pick you up from the nearest town.""

""Sounds great,"" I told her. ""We're looking for something simple, maybe a week or two.""

She paused, then added, ""It's quiet out here. No distractions. Just bring what you need.""

Anna and I high-fived each other. We figured it was our lucky break. We drove to the meeting spot, a dusty gas station in a tiny town with barely any buildings. A man pulled up in an old truck right on time. He was tall, with rough hands and a quiet stare. ""I'm Tom,"" he said, not smiling. ""Get in. It's a long drive.""

We climbed into the back seat with our bags. He didn't say much at first, just focused on the road. The path turned from pavement to dirt, bouncing us around. ""How far is it?"" Anna asked after a while.

""Far enough,"" he replied. ""No one bothers us out there.""

I glanced at Anna, but she shrugged. We tried to make small talk. ""Do you celebrate Halloween on the farm?"" I asked, trying to lighten things.

He grunted. ""Not really. Too busy.""

The silence grew after that. The landscape changed to flat, empty land with scattered trees and no signs of other houses. My phone lost signal about an hour in. Tom's hands gripped the wheel tighter, and he kept checking the mirrors, like he expected someone behind us. I felt a knot in my gut, but I told myself it was just the isolation playing tricks. Anna whispered to me, ""He's a bit odd, but probably harmless.""

After what seemed like forever, we arrived at his place. It was a low house with a few outbuildings, all faded and worn. His wife came out to greet us‚Äîa thin woman with tired eyes. She showed us around quickly. ""You'll stay upstairs,"" she said to me. ""Anna, the neighbors are just down the way. Tom will drop you there.""

""Down the way?"" Anna asked. ""How far?""

""Not far,"" Tom said. ""Let's go.""

He drove Anna off while the wife gave me a quick tour of the kitchen. She avoided my eyes, speaking in short sentences. ""Food's in the fridge. Help yourself."" Then she left me alone in the upstairs room. It was small, with a bed, a table, and one window. I unpacked a little, waiting for Anna to come back, but hours passed. The sun started dipping low, and I heard the truck return, but no Anna.

""Where's my friend?"" I asked Tom when he came inside.

""She's settled in,"" he said flatly. ""You'll see her tomorrow.""

I nodded, but something felt wrong. That night, I tried to sleep, but the house was too quiet. Around midnight, I heard footsteps outside my door. I sat up, listening. The knob turned slowly, but the door was locked‚ÄîI had checked it earlier. Then a soft click, like metal on metal. My door swung open, and Tom stood there, blocking the light from the hall. ""Just checking if you need anything,"" he said, his voice low.

""I'm fine,"" I managed to say. ""Thanks.""

He stared for a moment, then closed the door. I heard another click‚Äîthe lock turning from the outside. My pulse quickened. I tried the knob, but it wouldn't budge. ""Hey!"" I called out. ""The door's stuck!""

No answer. I went to the window, but it was nailed shut, the glass thick and dirty. No way out. My phone still had no bars. Panic set in. I banged on the door, yelling for the wife. ""Let me out! This isn't funny!""

Hours dragged on. In the morning, a tray slid under the door‚Äîbread, water, some cheese. No note, no explanation. ""What's going on?"" I shouted. ""Why am I locked in?""

The wife's voice came through, faint. ""It's for your own good. Just stay calm.""

""My own good? Let me see Anna!""

""She'll be fine. Eat your food.""

I paced the room, my mind racing. Were they keeping us for work? Or something worse? I thought about all the stories I'd heard of people disappearing in remote places. The day stretched, and I tried prying the window with my nails, but it held firm. That evening, another tray came. I refused to eat, banging harder. ""Tell me what's happening!""

Tom's voice this time, gruff. ""Quiet down. Neighbors might hear.""

Neighbors? The ad mentioned neighbors. But how close? I started thinking about escape. I had a small knife in my bag from cutting fruit on the road. I worked at the door frame, chipping wood, but it was slow. Night fell again, and I heard them talking downstairs, voices muffled. ""The buyer's ready,"" Tom said. ""We need to keep her healthy.""

Buyer's ready? My blood ran cold. What were they planning? Selling something‚Äîme? Parts of me? I remembered vague news about organ rings in isolated areas. Fear gripped me tighter. I worked faster on the door, sweat dripping, hands aching.

The next day, no tray. I yelled until my throat hurt. Then, in the afternoon, I heard a vehicle outside‚Äînot Tom's truck. Footsteps approached the house. A knock on the main door. ""Anyone home?"" a man's voice called.

Tom answered below. ""What do you want?""

""Saw a light up there last night. That room's usually empty. Everything okay?""

""It's nothing. Family visiting.""

The visitor paused. ""Mind if I check? Been hearing odd things.""

Tom hesitated. ""No need.""

But the man insisted. ""Just a quick look.""

I pounded on my door, screaming. ""Help! I'm locked in! Please!""

Silence, then rushing feet. The door unlocked, and Tom yanked it open, his face red with anger. ""Shut your mouth!""

But the neighbor was already upstairs, a sturdy guy in work clothes. He saw me, disheveled and terrified. ""What's this?""

""She's... sick,"" Tom lied. ""Keeping her safe.""

The neighbor looked at me. ""You okay, miss?""

""No! They've locked me in. My friend's at the neighbors‚Äîplease, check on her!""

His eyes narrowed. He pushed past Tom. ""We're sorting this now.""

Tom tried to block him, but the neighbor was stronger. He called out to his own truck, where another person waited. ""Get the police on the radio!""

Chaos erupted. Tom's wife appeared, pleading. ""Don't! We didn't mean harm.""

But the neighbor ignored her, pulling me downstairs. ""Come with me.""

We got in his vehicle, and he drove fast to the next property. Anna was there, locked in a similar room. She burst into tears when she saw me. ""They wouldn't let me leave! Said I owed them for the ride.""

The neighbors‚Äîthe ones who had Anna‚Äîweren't home, but we broke in the window to get her out. The rescuer drove us straight to the nearest town with a police station, hours away. On the way, he explained. ""I've suspected them for months. Strange visitors at night, people coming and going. Saw your light and knew something was off.""

The police raided the properties that night. They found evidence‚Äîdocuments, contacts for shady deals. Turns out, Tom and his wife were part of a group that lured young travelers with fake jobs, held them, and sold them to buyers for organs. The ""neighbors"" were in on it. Anna and I were lucky; the deal for me was set for the next day.

We testified, and they got arrested. But the fear lingers. Every time I think of that road trip, the empty roads, the locked door, the whispers downstairs‚ÄîI wonder how close we came to never leaving. Anna and I don't talk about Halloween adventures anymore. We stick to crowded places, where help is just a shout away.





# ""Highway to Nowhere"":

My boyfriend, Alex, and I had been planning this road trip for months. We wanted to drive from California to Nevada, hitting a few small towns along the way to celebrate Halloween with some friends in Las Vegas. It was our first big adventure together after college, just the two of us in our old van, packed with snacks and costumes. Alex was excited about the open road, and I loved seeing him smile as he mapped out the route on his phone.

We left early one morning in late October, the air crisp but not too cold. The highway stretched out ahead, empty for miles except for the occasional truck. Alex drove while I handled the music, playing old rock songs to keep things fun. ""This is going to be the best trip ever,"" he said, reaching over to squeeze my hand. I nodded, feeling happy and free.

As the day went on, we stopped at a gas station for fuel and coffee. The clerk behind the counter chatted with us about the route. ""Watch out for those long stretches at night,"" he warned. ""Not much out there if you break down."" Alex laughed it off. ""We've got a full tank and each other. What could go wrong?"" I smiled, but something in the clerk's eyes made me pause for a second.

Back on the road, we talked about everything‚Äîour future, silly Halloween plans, even what costumes we'd wear to the party. Alex wanted to go as a classic vampire, and I teased him about it. ""You'll look ridiculous with those fake fangs,"" I said. He grinned. ""As long as you're my victim, Emily, it'll be perfect.""

Hours passed, and the sun started dipping low. We were on a remote part of the highway, no towns in sight, just desert on both sides. That's when I noticed a pickup truck behind us, its lights flashing. Alex glanced in the rearview mirror. ""What's that guy doing?"" he muttered. The truck pulled up beside us, and the driver, a man in a hat, gestured wildly toward the back of our van.

""Looks like he's saying something's wrong with our exhaust or tire,"" Alex said, slowing down. ""Maybe we should pull over and check."" I felt a twinge of unease. ""Are you sure? It's getting dark."" But Alex was always the helpful type. ""It'll be quick. Better safe than sorry.""

We pulled off to the side, gravel crunching under the tires. The truck stopped behind us. Alex got out, and I stayed in the passenger seat, watching in the side mirror. The man approached, tall and broad-shouldered, wearing dusty clothes. ""Hey, mate,"" he called out in a rough voice. ""Your exhaust is sparking. Could start a fire.""

Alex walked to the back with him. I heard them talking faintly. ""Let me see,"" Alex said. ""Emily, rev the engine a bit?"" I slid over to the driver's seat and pressed the gas gently. The engine roared, and then‚Äîbang. A sharp crack echoed, like a firecracker but louder, closer.

I turned, confused. ""Alex?"" No answer. The man appeared at the window suddenly, his face hard, eyes cold. He yanked the door open before I could react. ""Get out,"" he growled, pointing a small gun at me. My mind raced‚Äî this couldn't be happening. He grabbed my arm, pulling me from the seat. I stumbled onto the ground. ""Where's Alex?"" I demanded, voice shaking.

He didn't answer. Instead, he twisted my arms behind my back, wrapping something tight around my wrists‚Äîcable ties, biting into my skin. ""Shut up,"" he hissed. Pain shot through my shoulders as he dragged me toward his truck. I kicked and twisted, but he was stronger. ""Please, let me go,"" I begged. ""What did you do to Alex?""

He shoved me into the back of his truck, under a canopy. I hit the metal floor hard, tasting blood from my lip. He climbed in after me, trying to wrap tape around my ankles. That's when I saw my chance‚Äî the canopy flap was loose. I rolled away, kicking at him. My foot connected with his chest, and he grunted, losing his grip for a moment.

I scrambled out the back, wrists still bound, and ran into the darkness off the highway. Bushes scratched my legs as I dove behind them, heart racing so fast I thought it would burst. The man cursed under his breath‚ÄîI heard him crash through the brush after me. ""Come back here!"" he shouted.

I crawled deeper into the scrub, thorns tearing at my clothes. The ground was rough, rocks digging into my knees. I found a thick bush and wedged myself under it, trying not to breathe too loud. Minutes passed. I heard his footsteps crunching nearby, stopping, listening. Then, a dog's bark‚Äî he had a dog with him. Oh no. The animal sniffed around, getting closer. I pressed my face into the dirt, willing myself invisible.

The dog whined, paws scraping close to my hiding spot. The man whispered to it, ""Find her, boy."" My body tensed, every muscle aching. The dog paused right above me, nose twitching. I held my breath, eyes squeezed shut. After what seemed like forever, the man yanked the leash. ""Nothing here. Let's go."" Footsteps faded, but I didn't move. I waited, listening to the truck engine start, then drive away.

Still, I stayed hidden. Hours dragged on. My wrists throbbed from the ties, and I could feel blood trickling down my hands. Thoughts of Alex flooded my mind‚Äî that bang, him not answering. Tears stung my eyes, but I pushed them back. I had to survive.

Finally, when the night grew quieter, I wiggled out from the bush. My legs were numb, but I made it to the highway edge. Headlights appeared in the distance. I hid again, not sure who it was. The first vehicle passed‚Äîa car, speeding by. Then another set of lights, bigger, a semi-truck. I stepped out, waving my bound hands frantically.

The truck slowed, air brakes hissing. Two drivers, a man and a woman, jumped out. ""Are you okay?"" the woman asked, eyes wide. I collapsed against the truck. ""He shot my boyfriend. Tied me up. Please help.""

They cut the ties with a knife from their toolbox, gave me water, and called the police on their radio. ""Stay calm,"" the man said. ""Cops are coming."" I told them everything‚Äîthe flagged down stop, the gunshot, the escape. They listened, wrapping a blanket around me.

Police arrived soon after, lights flashing. They searched the area, found Alex's body behind our van, hidden in the ditch. One bullet to the head. No sign of the man or his truck, but they took my description. Days later, after hospitals and questions, they caught him‚ÄîBradley something, a drifter with a record. DNA from my shirt matched his.

I never went on another road trip. Every Halloween, the memories creep back, sharper than before. The empty highway, that bang, the dog's sniff. It's all too real.





# ""Matamoros"":

Last October, my buddies and I decided to hit the road for a quick getaway. Tom, David, Ryan, and I had been talking about it since summer‚Äîdriving down to the border for some Halloween fun in Mexico. We figured crossing over to Matamoros would give us a taste of real celebrations, with costumes, music, and crowds that went all night. I was behind the wheel of my old pickup truck, the one with the scratched-up paint from too many off-road adventures. Ryan sat shotgun, fiddling with the radio to find something upbeat. Tom and David were in the back, passing around snacks and joking about who would chicken out first if things got too wild.

""Man, Chris, you sure this truck can make it across without falling apart?"" Tom laughed, crunching on a chip. He was always the loud one, the guy who kept the energy up.

I glanced in the rearview mirror. ""It got us this far from Austin. Besides, if it breaks down, we walk. Adds to the adventure.""

David nodded, leaning forward. ""Yeah, and Ryan here can translate if we need to hitch a ride. Your Spanish is decent, right?""

Ryan grinned. ""Better than yours. Just don't ask me to order anything fancy. Tacos and beer, that's my limit.""

We crossed the bridge into Matamoros around evening, the streets already buzzing with people in masks and painted faces. Vendors hawked candy skulls and fake blood, and the air carried the smell of street food. We parked near a busy avenue and joined the flow, weaving through groups laughing and dancing. It felt alive, like the whole town was in on one big party.

After a couple hours of wandering, we ended up at a packed bar called El Puente. Music thumped inside, and we squeezed our way to a table. Beers came quick, and soon we were toasting to the night.

""To stupid decisions and making it back in one piece,"" I said, clinking bottles.

Ryan raised his. ""And to not getting lost like last time in Dallas.""

We laughed, but as the night wore on, the crowd thickened. People bumped into us, some in elaborate costumes that hid their faces completely. At one point, a guy in a dark hood brushed past me, his eyes lingering a bit too long. I shook it off‚ÄîHalloween vibes, right?

Around midnight, Ryan stood up. ""Gotta hit the bathroom. Be right back.""

""Want company?"" David asked.

""Nah, I'm good. Save my seat.""

He vanished into the throng. We kept chatting, but ten minutes passed, then twenty. Tom checked his watch. ""Where's he at? Line must be long.""

I scanned the room. No sign of him. ""Let's check outside. Maybe he stepped out for air.""

We pushed through the door, the cool night hitting us. The street was still lively, but quieter in spots. We called his name, walking up and down the block. Nothing. My chest tightened a little‚ÄîRyan wasn't the type to wander off without saying something.

""Split up?"" Tom suggested. ""You and David go that way, I'll check the alley.""

We agreed, meeting back at the truck if no luck. David and I hurried down the sidewalk, peering into shops and asking vendors if they'd seen a guy in a blue shirt, tall with short brown hair. Most shook their heads, too busy with customers.

An hour later, we regrouped. No Ryan. ""This isn't right,"" I said, my voice steadier than I felt. ""We should call the cops.""

David frowned. ""On Halloween? They'll think he's just drunk somewhere.""

But we did it anyway. At the local station, an officer took our report, nodding politely. ""Many people get separated in the crowds. Check back in the morning. He probably found a place to crash.""

That didn't sit well. We drove back across the border to our motel in Brownsville, figuring he'd show up there. Sleep didn't come easy. I kept replaying the night, wondering if I'd missed something.

Morning brought no calls, no knocks. We headed back to Matamoros, handing out flyers we printed at a copy shop‚ÄîRyan's photo from my phone, our numbers scribbled below. ""Have you seen this man?"" we asked everyone we could.

A street vendor paused when I showed him the picture. ""Maybe. Last night, near the bar. Talking to a woman, tall, pretty. Then some guys in a truck.""

My pulse quickened. ""What guys? What truck?""

He shrugged. ""Old white pickup. Didn't see faces. They drove off fast.""

Tom gripped my arm. ""That's something. Let's ask around more.""

We spent the day combing the area, talking to bartenders and locals. One guy at a taco stand mentioned hearing about disappearances lately‚Äîpeople vanishing, whispers of bad groups involved in drugs. ""Stay out of the outskirts,"" he warned. ""Not safe.""

David looked worried. ""What if Ryan got mixed up in something?""

I pushed the thought away. ""He's smart. Probably just lost his phone.""

But doubt crept in. That evening, we drove farther out, following a tip from a shop owner about a ranch where sketchy folks hung out. The road turned dusty, buildings thinning to fields. We pulled over near a fence, the place looking abandoned.

""Should we check it?"" Tom asked.

I nodded. ""Quietly. Don't want trouble.""

We hopped the fence, hearts racing. The ground was uneven, dotted with sheds. As we neared one, voices drifted‚Äîlow, chanting. We froze behind a bush.

Peeking through, I saw figures in a circle, lit by lanterns. A man in the center held something shiny‚Äîa knife? They murmured words I didn't understand, rhythmic and eerie.

David whispered, ""What is that?""

Before I could answer, a branch snapped under Tom's foot. Heads turned. ""Run!"" I hissed.

We bolted back to the truck, engines roaring as we sped away. Back at the motel, we paced the room.

""That was weird,"" Tom said. ""Like some ritual.""

I rubbed my face. ""We need help. Real help.""

The next day, we met with a U.S. agent our families connected us to. He listened, face grim. ""There are groups here‚Äîcults mixed with cartels. They do... things for protection. Sacrifices.""

The word hung heavy. ""You think Ryan...""

He shook his head. ""Don't jump ahead. But stay put. We'll search.""

We couldn't. Another tip came‚Äîa local kid said he'd seen a truck like the one described heading to Santa Elena ranch. We drove there at dusk, parking far off and sneaking closer.

The ranch looked ordinary at first‚Äîbarn, house, fields. But as we approached a shed, a foul smell hit us, like rot and smoke. Inside, through a crack, I saw altars with candles, bones scattered. Animal bones? Human?

Tom gagged. ""This is bad.""

Then, footsteps. We hid as two men walked by, talking in Spanish. One mentioned ""the American"" and ""the padrino's orders.""

My blood ran cold. Padrino‚Äîgodfather? Leader?

We followed them quietly to a clearing. There, a group gathered around a pit. They dug, pulling up... dirt-covered shapes. Bodies? I strained to see.

David grabbed my shoulder. ""Look‚Äîover there.""

Tied to a post, disheveled and bruised‚ÄîRyan. Alive, but barely. His eyes were wide, mouth gagged.

""We have to get him,"" I whispered.

The men chanted again, a tall woman joining them‚Äîbeautiful, but her smile twisted. She spoke of power, of blood bringing strength.

Tom nodded. ""Distraction. I'll make noise over there. You two grab him.""

It was risky, but we had no choice. Tom slipped away, then yelled, throwing rocks at a shed. The group startled, some running toward the sound.

David and I dashed to Ryan. ""It's us,"" I said, cutting the ropes with my pocket knife. ""Come on.""

He stumbled, weak. ""They... they killed others. For rituals. Brain... they take...""

""Shh, later,"" David urged.

Shouts erupted. They spotted us. We ran, Ryan between us, legs shaking. Bullets whizzed past‚Äîreal guns.

""Truck!"" I yelled.

We piled in, tires spinning on gravel. In the mirror, figures chased, one firing more shots. A tire blew, but I kept going, swerving onto the main road.

We made it to the border, agents swarming us after our call. Ryan collapsed, medics rushing in.

Later, in the hospital, he told us everything. Abducted on the street by men promising a shortcut. Taken to the ranch, held in a shack. The leader‚Äîa man called Constanzo‚Äîranted about sacrifices for invincibility. They tortured victims, removed organs while alive, boiled them in pots for potions. Ryan was next, but our arrival stopped it.

Police raided the ranch days later, finding graves‚Äîdozens of mutilated bodies. The cult fled, but some were caught. Constanzo died in a shootout, ordering his own death.

We survived, but the nightmares linger. Every Halloween, I think of that trip, the chants echoing. Ryan healed physically, but none of us are the same. We learned the hard way‚Äîsome horrors hide in plain sight, waiting for the unwary.





# ""Headwaters"":

It was the fall of 1973, and my family decided to take a big trip across the country to see new places. I was thirteen, excited about skipping school for a while. My dad worked at a car factory back in Michigan, and he saved up his time off for this. Mom packed the van with snacks and blankets, and my little sister Lily, who was seven, kept asking if we could stop at every diner for pie. My two younger brothers argued over who got the window seat. We planned to drive west, camp along the way, and celebrate Halloween in some fun spot with costumes and candy. Lily wanted to dress as a pumpkin, and I picked a witch outfit from the store.

We hit the road early in October, singing songs and playing games to pass the miles. Dad drove most of the time, telling stories about his own childhood adventures. Mom read maps and pointed out landmarks. By the time we reached Montana, the leaves had turned bright colors, and the air felt crisp. We found a spot at Headwaters Park near a wide river. It looked peaceful, with tall trees and open spaces for tents. Dad set up the big family tent for him and Mom, and a smaller one for us kids. Lily clutched her stuffed bear as we unpacked. ""This is going to be the best Halloween ever,"" she said, her eyes wide with joy.

That evening, we built a small fire and roasted marshmallows. Dad shared funny tales about old camping trips, making us all laugh. Mom hugged Lily close and said, ""Stay near the tents tonight, okay? No wandering."" Lily nodded, promising to be good. As the fire died down, we crawled into our sleeping bags. The boys fell asleep fast, snoring softly. Lily snuggled next to me, her little hand in mine. I lay awake for a bit, listening to the river flow and thinking about the costumes we'd wear in a few days. Eventually, sleep came.

I woke to a strange sound, like fabric tearing. My eyes adjusted to the dark, and I saw a slit in the tent wall, right near where Lily slept. A cool breeze slipped in. I sat up quietly, my pulse quickening. Lily's spot was empty‚Äîher sleeping bag rumpled, her bear gone. I whispered her name, but no answer came. The boys still slept. I poked my head out the flap, scanning the dim campsite. Shadows moved from the trees, but nothing clear. I stepped out barefoot, the ground cold under my feet. ""Lily?"" I called softly, not wanting to wake everyone yet.

I walked a few steps toward the parking area where our van sat. Footprints marked the dirt, small ones like Lily's, mixed with larger ones leading away. My breath caught. I ran back to the parents' tent. ""Mom! Dad! Lily's gone!"" I shouted. They bolted up, confused at first. Dad grabbed a flashlight and shone it around. We found Lily's stuffed animals tossed in the grass, like she'd been pulled away quickly. Mom's face went pale. ""Where is she? Lily!"" she cried, her voice breaking.

Dad rushed to the park office to call the police. Officers arrived soon, their lights flashing. They asked questions: Had we seen anyone strange? Heard any cars? I told them about the tear in the tent and the footprints. They nodded, saying it looked like someone took her. The search started right away‚Äîmen with dogs combed the woods, helicopters buzzed overhead. Mom held me tight, tears streaming. ""We'll find her,"" she whispered, but her grip felt desperate.

Days blurred into worry. We stayed in a nearby motel, waiting for news. Police talked about possible leads, but nothing solid. Halloween came and went without celebration. I stared at my unused witch hat, feeling empty. Lily's pumpkin costume hung in the van, untouched. Then, a week later, the phone rang in our room. Dad answered, his face hardening. ""Who is this?"" he demanded. The voice on the other end described Lily's nails‚Äîhow they curved in a special way, like little humps. ""If you want her back, wait for instructions,"" the man said, then hung up. No more calls came that day.

We told the police, who traced it but found nothing. The FBI got involved, saying it might cross state lines. Agents set up in our motel, recording lines. Mom paced, barely eating. ""Why her? She's just a child,"" she said to me one night. I hugged her, hiding my own fear. What if the man hurt her? Images flashed in my mind‚ÄîLily scared, alone.

Months passed. Winter hit hard, but we couldn't go home without answers. In February, news broke about another girl missing nearby, a teenager named Sandra. Her picture looked like any kid‚Äîsmiling, full of life. Parts of her were found later, burned and scattered on a ranch. I overheard agents whispering about connections. My stomach tightened. Was it the same person?

On the one-year mark, June again but feeling like forever, the phone rang at the motel. Mom picked up. The man laughed, saying he'd been traveling with Lily, pretending she was his kid. ""She's fine,"" he mocked. Mom begged, ""Please, let me hear her."" He hung up. She collapsed, sobbing. Dad held her, his eyes angry. Another call came in September from far away. A child's voice said, ""Mommy?"" But it sounded wrong, forced. Agents traced it to a city down south.

They suspected a local man, David, who lived nearby and had a bad history. He'd been in the military, built houses for work. Mom decided to face him. ""I need to know,"" she told the agents. They wired her with a recorder. I waited in the car with Dad, biting my nails. She went to his door, acting like a neighbor with questions. He invited her in, calm at first. But when she mentioned missing girls, his smile faded. ""Why ask me?"" he said, voice low.

Mom pushed: ""I think you know something about my daughter."" He shifted, eyes darting. ""Get out,"" he growled. She left, shaking. Agents listened to the tape, saying his reactions matched a guilty man. They watched him, gathered evidence. One night, they raided his house. What they found made headlines: frozen packages with body parts, a hand with fingers cut off. He confessed to everything‚Äîtaking Lily from our tent, strangling her at his ranch, cutting her up. He did the same to Sandra and others. Said he killed a boy years before at the same park.

He hanged himself in jail before trial. We finally had answers, but no Lily to bury whole. Mom and Dad brought us home, broken. I still hear that tearing sound in my dreams, see the empty spot beside me. The road trip that started with hope ended in nightmare. Every October, when kids dress up, I lock my doors tight, remembering how one man turned our adventure into terror.",1,1760228954.0,horrorX,0,1.0,False

I would have never imagined this day would ever become real. My gf pretty much said to me she doesn't wanna be with me anymore, that she wanna move back to her home country and doesn't see a future with us together anymore. I am not even sure why am I here, just typing anything that comes to my mind because my stomach hurts so much just thinking about it. 

More than 2 years ago we started dating after knowing each other from work. At work party she told me her husband has cheated on her several times and they are done but still are living together until one of them move out. At the beginning we went to grab a coffee after almost every day at work even at weekends. We spent most of our time together. After dating 3 months we decided to move in which was the dumbest move ever. I felt so great I couldn't resist but after moving in her behaviour has changed. She stopped being kind, sweet and respectful after receiving what she wanted from me - which was stability. We decided to make several trips, concerts, even visited her sister. She lives so far away it took us almost 2 days to get there - a different country, language barrier was there. Sadly, both their parents have passed away a few years ago. 

3 months ago after returning from her sister she told me that she doesn't want to live in this country anymore and wants to move back after a while but not yet. I totally get it, her sister is her only family, but still I decided to break up because I don't wanna be someone who doesn't want to be with me. I can't move there because it's totally a different world for me. Today, she finally told me she is gonna move out 2 days later to which I finally feel relieved, those 3 months were such a rollercoaster to both of us. 
 
A few weeks ago this new guy came into our work pretty much the same age and whenever I come nearby they often talk to each other smiling all around and I feel like the same thing from 2 years ago is happening again. I felt back then I am saving this poor woman from a bad guy, but in our story I might be him too but probably for a different reason.
I know what you're thinking - I am an idiot and I should have never been with her. I know it. And still I am so pissed at myself that I ever let her come into my home. I hope everything will be alright after her moving out. I just wanna focus on myself but all this happening is making me so nervous I can't think straight. In the last 6 months I've worked so many overtime, part time jobs and tried to get into investing with 0 knowledge about it to make sure my future is gonna be better but now I just feel so exhausted and wanna be left alone.

People always say God is dead. They blame
""the gay agenda"" or ""the liberals"" or whatever else is trending on cable news. That's not true though. God died a while ago; we're just now seeing the effects. Consider this a warning.
I work the graveyard shift at St. Jude's. It's the kind of job where you spend most of your time listening to the low hum of the vending machines and the distant, predictable beep-beep of monitors. Isolation was the usual and by now l've grown to like it. It keeps the world ‚Äî the noisy, confused, idiotic world ‚Äîat bay.
It was 3:17 AM on a Tuesday, about four months before I started writing this. This shift was normal, boring, quiet, and the hospital was entirely too empty. I was charting vitals when Mrs. Davies, room 412, hit her call light. She was eighty-six, prone to mild confusion, and usually just wanted her water refilled.
But when I walked in, her eyes were wide open, looking at the ceiling. ""The stars, dear,"" she whispered, her voice reedy and thin. ""There were so many. More than I thought existed.""
""Just a bad dream, Mrs. Davies,"" I said, going through the motions, like I had so many times before.
""No, not a dream. And the voice..."" She looked at me, and there was a clarity in her eyes that hadn't been there in years. ""A gentle voice.
Like silk over water. It told me, ""I'm here, but the great devil is getting too strong.""
I chalked it up to the meds, refilled the water, and moved on. An hour later, Mr. Henderson, down in 402, a twenty-year-old with a broken leg and bad attitude, flagged me down.
""Dude, I had the weirdest dream,"" he muttered, scratching his cast. ""I was floating, looking at like, billions of lights. And this voice was all up in my head. It was like, ""I'm here, but the adversary is getting seriously deadly,"" Tripped me out.""
I felt the first little prickle of anxiety then. Two patients, completely different demographics, the same weird vision. Stars. Smooth voice. An adversary.
The pattern accelerated, and after a while a man must ask himself what is simply coincidence and what is deliberate. I was at my questioning point.
By sunrise l'd taken reports from seven people.
A retired history professor in 409 said the voice was conveying the message ""I persist, but the opposition has achieved a critical, lethal threshold."" A nurse I relieved told me one of her kids woke up sobbing, babbling about space and a voice that ""sounded like my favorite song, but the words were scary.""
The next day it was all over the morning news:
""Mass Hysteria? Reports of identical strange dreams sweep the globe."" Experts talked about a global spike in atmospheric pressure or maybe a viral social media trend getting out of hand, or at worst a sort of virus or parasite.
I didn't buy it. I knew something they didn't.
Because the night Mrs. Davies hit her call light, I wasn't asleep. I was chatting vitals, sipping my cold coffee, and wide awake.
And I still heard it.
Not with my ears, but inside my skull, bypassing the eardrums entirely: the smooth, unnerving whisper, cutting through the hospital's silence like a razor through cotton. It was the same message everyone else had received, word-for-word, only slightly clearer to me than their jumbled recollections:
""I'm here but the enemy grows deadly.""
I wasn't a dreamer. I was a witness. I was the only person who could confirm it wasn't a shared delusion, but a broadcast. The last, desperate transmission from a failing power source.
It took me a few weeks of panicked investigation-talking to anyone I could k the street, asking my family-to confirm the scope of the global whisper. Everyone had heard it.
And a few weeks after that, the news broke out about the ""whale.""
I live about twenty miles from the coastline they cordoned off. The official story was that a new, unidentified species of whale had washed ashore‚Äîa record breaker. They were going to burn the body in place to prevent the disease it seemed to have from spreading. 

I had to see it. I had to know what had shown up that was enough for grown men and women, respectable scientists, to shove like that on the news.
I got close to the beach the next night. The air was thick and heavy, and a smell was rolling in that made my eyes water. It wasn't just the smell of something dead. It smelled of ammonia, oil, and burned skin. It was a smell that made my stomach churn, and my brain started screaming to get away from it.
Thad to lean against a dune, hands shaking, fighting the immediate urge to vomit.
Nauseous, dizzy, and suddenly shivering despite the warm night, I forced myself to look over the barrier.
And I saw it.
It was black against the white sand, stretching further than the high-tide line, a massive, ruined hill of flesh. The official story was a lie.
This was not a whale. Its face, or what should have been a face, was just black. But it was covered in little dents that might have once been eyes. And running just beneath the skin of that dead, colossal thing were veins like nothing I knew was possible. Pure, jet black, pulsing not with blood, but with some thick substance, almost the consistency of molasses. But the strangest thing was where the black veins started. Every case of necrosis I've ever seen starts in the extremities, fingers, toes, things like that. But the fingertips of the being were devoid of black, while the center was full of it.
I stayed until dawn, just watching. The adversary hadn't just killed this thing, this pathetic being that was supposed to be God, it had reduced it to a rotting pile of chemicals and flesh that was going to be burned by humanity soon anyways.
I became an atheist right there, smelling that rot. Because what good is it to believe in a God who can be reduced to this and is now dead?
And that's why I wrote this warning. The truth is out there, literally rotting. And the reason I'm telling you this is because if you think the world can work properly without something ruling it then you're dead wrong. Almost laughable how hopeful everyone seems now. Little do the know that any day we can be plunged into the Pit.",1,1760228743.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

I tried to write last night but the story fought me and Peach wanted cuddles so I only officially got 283 words added. Still, I did do some rewriting so I'd like to say that number should actually be around 350-400. And today? I have got nothing done. No writing and no cleaning of my office. It's Saturday. I didn't want to do anything.

It did not rain like the forecast said it would; or rather, it got all the rain out its system in the early morning and for the rest of the day it was cool and sunny. Not nice enough to write with my fingers frozen but to bright to spend the whole day inside. Mother was vacuuming so I took peach out for a while to get away from the noise. It was a good time. Unproductive but good.

I'm waking up too late to want to get anything done, I think. My sleep schedule is not adjusting to the earlier nights very well. I'm going to try to write again tonight with my coffee and then get to bed early. One of those things are surely going to be much easier than the other but who knows which. We shall see.

1o4b4rz,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1o4b4rz/loml/,LOML,"By all appearances I have a good life - a great job that I secured through a college education, married my high school sweetheart, a few wonderful kids, an idyllic home in a wholesome community.

Somewhere along the way my wife and I drifted apart. She cheated on me once when we were first married, and we worked very hard to get past that. Couples counseling was important and it helped that I'm someone who is very easy to forgive. A feckless people pleaser to some extent. We made it through the other side and made a life together. I forgave her but in retrospect I don't think I ever fully recovered and don't think I ever will.

I blamed myself for playing a part in her cheating on me. I was distant and lacked emotional intelligence during a very difficult time in her life. I didn't actively do anything to hurt her, but my generally passive and stoic nature made it hard for her to confide in me. So, I positioned our lives so I could provide everything possible to make her happy. I became an avid runner, got in shape, learned how to dress myself, and had a moderate glow up as we transitioned to the part of our lives where we had kids. I excelled in my career and proudly marched my way to the fiscal purgatory of the middle class. Got us new cars, a house, all the creature comforts a millennial family could want.

Things seemed fine, partially because I was always so hyper focused on succeeding. Completing every mission I laid out for myself. That included making sure my marriage didn't fail.

Then at work, I made a friend. She was married too, had a kid around the same age as mine, and we hung out with the same circle of friends. One day she missed out on a lunch with our other friends, so I invited her to lunch on my own. Things started out harmless, more DMs at work, texting occasionally outside of work. Then the chats became more suggestive, more personal. She confided in me how unhappy she was in her marriage. Her husband did nothing - she felt helpless in a life she created but didn't want. I genuinely didn't think her feelings were as strong as they were until she kissed me. We had a short fling, one that confused me because up until then I considered myself happy. I had achieved so many things I had set out for myself to do, so why would I do something so reckless and emotional?

My friend gave me an ultimatum - either blow up my life for her or I couldn't be a part of it anymore. I knew I wasn't going to ever blow up my life for her. I asked myself if it was because I didn't feel that strongly for her, or if it was because I'd never be able to do something like that to my family.

I suppose that was the driving force for me to actively seek out an affair here, on reddit. Was I now someone who had affairs? Was I that the kind of person I was, or was this a fluke situation with a friend IRL that I just had to experience and move on?

I browsed the appropriate subreddits and eventually made an ad. I got a surprising amount of messages, some of which were thoughtful enough to warrant a response. But nothing really materialized. I was going through a life-or-death family medical emergency and was just about to give up on finding someone when she reached out to me.

I got a message from a woman bold enough to open the dialogue with pictures. She was so beautiful I legitimately thought I was getting catfished. I left the messages on read for a day before deciding to answer.

We started talking on a separate app and immediately hit it off. We exchanged messages for hours. We connected so deeply and so quickly. We agreed to meet right away in person. It was supposed to just be a quick coffee date. A meet-and-greet. What followed was the most intense, loving relationship I've ever had. We talked every day for hours. I started every day by texting her good morning and ended it by texting her goodnight. My every thought was consumed by her and how perfect we felt together. I opened up to her in ways I never did with my wife, any of my friends, anyone else in my life I had ever encountered.

She was perfect to me. An infectious smile, deeply blue eyes full of warmth, addictively soft lips. A kind soul, cut from the same cloth - a people pleaser, but one who knew how to emotionally connect with people. We had incredible, mind-blowing sex that I still think about every day.

She had her reasons for seeking an affair. I understood and sympathized. We fantasized about being together one day. I never felt that way with the friend I previously was intimate with. It never felt real, not like this. It genuinely felt like I found my person.

I had no plan. It was easy to think we could just do that for years and years, until we both worked up the gumption to change our situations. I had no intention of leaving my wife, but I found myself actively thinking about all the different circumstances in which I could somehow be with my newfound soulmate. We saw each other multiple times a week. Spent trips overnight together. We were genuinely and truly happy together. Every moment apart felt like the space between the actual story of our lives.

My wife had been struggling with alcohol for years. She would go on benders, and it got progressively worse after COVID. Whether or not my affair actually contributed to it worsening further, it did start to become untenable and I eventually blamed myself when she became a danger to me and those around her. Drinking and driving. Binge drinking during the day and passing out before noon. Not attending our kids activities because she blacked out.

It became too much. I tried not to put it on my shoulders, but I knew eventually I would. I had a hard time facing it head on. This confident handle I had on my life started to crumble slowly. It got to the point where I thought the only way to fix my life was to let go of the only person who really knew me and understood me.

Our relationship wasn't perfect. We both made our mistakes. But she was perfect for me. Every inch of her, inside and out, every word she spoke, every sound she made, every heavy breath she took when we held each other - she was made just for me.

No one in my situation deserves pity, let alone sympathy. I'll make my life work. I always do. I've never had regrets in my life, not substantive ones anyway. Until now. Not just for myself, thinking about what could have been. But for her, what I put her through, the pain I caused her. And the fact that if I never came into her life, she probably would have already run off with someone else and started building herself a better life. Any other sane man in my situation would have. I know I'll think about her every day for the rest of my life. Some part of me thinks the universe will construct some way for us to cross paths again, as unlikely as it was that we ever met in the first place. That's part of what keeps me going, even if I know deep down it's just a construct in my head. But I will always wonder what could have been. And wish I was with her.

Sometimes I think I'm a sociopath, and that all of my relationships are a reflection of that. Or I say that to myself as a rationalization for what I've done and the decision to carry all that scar tissue all alone. When I'm old and gray, I wonder what I'll think of myself. And if I ever will forgive myself as easily as I've forgiven everyone around me.

I just know no matter what happens, I won't deserve that forgiveness. From me, or anyone else.",1,1760228485.0,UnsentLetters,1,1.0,False

1o4b4gf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Crushes/comments/1o4b4gf/crush_with_coworker/,Crush with coworker,"Me (f34) work in this company for a year, then he (m26) joined after me.  We have close working relationships.  He acts as party boy.  I am the opposite.  

He tells me many personal things, family, views, love relationships, childhood, etc.  I share mine too.  We become close friends after several months.  I hangout with him one on one a lot. I planned for it most of the time.  He only hints me, hey, there was new restaurant, I would say, really, lets try together, etc.   But he seldom plans.

He tries to stay longer with me after dinners I planned, like, asked me to go for a drink, movie, park, dessert, coffee, bar, disco, etc.  He finds different conversations with me at work too.

We hang out twice a week after work now. He treats me like princess, orders all my favorite food, remembers every details about my habits, dos and donts.  He used to order secret dishes for me at dinner to surprise me. I feel like dating, but not actual dating.

Last night,  he invited me to disco.  I danced with him and our bodies were close enough that he nearly hugged me. Like before, we look like dating, but not dating.  He never steps across the line or touches me physically.  He just makes me feel being cared and likes me holding his arm occasionally.

I fall for him deeply. I hesitate,  as I am confused on him.  I feel the spark between us.  Is he being gentleman only? 

I think I am boring person to him.  He keeps making me laugh, saying, he likes spending time with me, but telling me he had some girls crushing on him, dated 1 or 2 times then never moving on.  When we go outside, he receives some calls regularly at night time, I felt that were from his relationships,  I stayed silent during his call, he read my mind, and said it was nothing special. Fast backward to one morning,  my supervisor asked me to call him to checkout where he was.  I obviously woke him up, he sounded hanging over.  I heard a woman's moaning at the back.  I pretended hearing nothing, but only asked him if he needed to apply leaves. I never told him what I heard.  He tempted me when he was back and apologized about his ""pet"".  I becomes more confused.  If he has someone, why he lied? He has no reason to lie on me as I am nobody to him officially.  

He showed me a video and pictures about his garden one day.   It films for someone walking to the garden, i can only see the steps of the person, I recognized a pair of shoes in his video and the same shoes by his bed. I feel he shows them to me intentionally and hinting me he has a woman around, though he pretends that was him, but I clearly know that was a woman based on the size of shoes.  I didn't say anything and kept the conversation onwards about ""garden"".  What does he expect my response?

In fact, I asked him directly few times.  If going out with me will be inconvenient,  or I asked him if he was unavailable,  or I dont want to trouble him, we could stop.  He keeps saying, he wants to go out with me, he won't if he doesn't.  We keeps moving after that.

When I told my friends,  most of them didn't believe he is interested on me.  He is just for fun for someone from different world.   We have big age gap and I am at senior position too.  I am sure I am not his type, I am too ""homey"". He is only curious on me.  I tried to persuade myself, it was his admiration, flirtation and spark on me.  Stay happy on where we are, don't need to label the relationship,  develop close friendship is fine.  I told myself to stay away from him many times, but I keep missing his company.

What do you think?  Is he interested on me? Or being polite to go out when I planned? What is he looking for?  Should I stop hanging out with him, avoiding falling on him deeper?

I‚Äôve been taking linzess for about a month now which has had no impact. Has anyone found any longer term solutions? 
I‚Äôve tried fiber supplements, increasing water intake, exercise, adding fiber to diet, eliminating gluten and dairy from my diet, coffee and hot water. None of these work. The daily pain is really hard to live with. Would love any ideas for solutions.

The jokes and plot developments are very precise, so with a good grasp of theoretical physics and a college degree in writing as well as a Nobel Peace Prize award if optional, you'll have a truly unforgettable experience unlike any other piece of media out there. Set in a fictional city of Paradise, it revolves around a group of cops working at a police station, which is a cryptic reference to Edgar Wright's 2007 hit buddy cop action comedy film Hot Fuzz featuring Nick Frost and Simon Pegg. The humor is very layered, for instance Bullet, the crack sniffing dog (voiced by Kyle Kinane) with a lousy obsession with beach girls and drugs, is a complex character as he was a dog who worked in Mexico during the drug wars back in the 1980s, it struck him for so long that he was no longer a good dog much like how Walter Hartwell White from the hit 2008 American series Breaking Bad who is voiced by the legendary Bryan Cranston went from a high school chemistry teacher to a drug lord of a monster or how Sara Goldfarb (voiced by Ellen Burstyn) from Darren Aronofsky's 2000 psychological horror movie Requirem for a Dream went from a good lady to a drug overdosed maniac. It is a critique on drugs and how it can affect our little kiddie brains and turn us into the worst of the worst. Then we have Dusty (voiced by Dana Snyder), the fat cop that has a deep crush on Gina Jabowski (voiced by Sarah Chalke and later Donna Jay Fulks in the fourth season) who has a severe morbid obesity fetish, and unfortunately according to the Church of Malloy manifesto written by Richard Dawkins and his cousin Yucko the Clown, Dusty gets constantly trolled for his obesity for the audience to get a bunch of yahoos and ha ha has. His name and design is also a reference to Channel 4's short running 2012 British adult animated sitcom by the name of Full English which features a character of the same name who is fat and loud, and is voiced by Kayvan Novak. Dusty's character in Paradise PD is a cultural critique on how fat shaming people is BAD, it's HORRIBLE, it's VICIOUS, it's DISGUSTING. It's not just a joke about obesity, it's about fatphobia, the true pain of rejection, and how it can lead to depression and feeling ashamed about your body weight. One intellectual scene in the show is when the gang is flying out with a Dusty sh*tting himself in the sky, it is a subtle reference to the iconic scene in Stanley Kubrick's 1964 war drama masterpiece Dr. Strangelove where Major Kong (who is voiced by Slim Pickens) is acting like a cowboy while riding an atomic bomb that is about to fall. Another intelligent character we have here is Hopson. (Also voiced by Dana Snyder) An old grandpa who works at the police station who is proud of being gay. He is truly the pinnacle of LGBTQ+ representation and should be considered the golden standard of modern animation. He is a brilliant reference to Wallace Wells (a notably gay character who is voiced by Kieran Culkin) from the 2010 romantic comedy cult classic Snott PeePeegrim VS. Humanity, also made by Edgar Wright and based on a graphic novel of the same name by Bryan Lee O'Malley and originally published by Oni Press. Our final character we have on our list and the main cop of the station, Chief Randall Crawford. (Voiced by Tom Kenny A.K.A SpongeBob Squarepants) He's the owner of the police station and is very clueless but powerful. His commanding presence is reminiscent of Jules Winnfield (voiced by Samuel L. Jackson) from Quentin Tarantino's 1994 neo-noir dark comedy film Pulp Fiction or Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (voiced by R. Lee Ermey) from Stanley Kubrick's 1987 war movie Full Metal Jacket. Some people speculate he's 42 years old which is the number of Douglas Adams' Hitchhicker's Guide to the Galaxy. It is truly mindblowing how people don't get the depths of these jokes, from the complex character development to the intellectual humor, so as a warning, people who hate Paradise PD truly ARE fools who don't take adult cartoons seriously. Only the truest of true intellectuals can understand how intelligent this masterpiece of a show is. Of course, the humor in this show is something to admire, the masterful timing of each scatological joke, testicle movement, drug detail and racial slur is nothing short of beautiful. I can't believe how many people dismiss this masterpiece of a show as Roger Black and Waco'O Guin delve us into this original world with rich lore and multiplex characters with gorgeous 2D animation that was painstakingly drawn by hand that would put other Netflix animated shows like Arcane to shame. The subtle character details, the excellent color theory, the impeccable craftsmanship and the beautiful characters designs make this show so good not even Disney would touch it. The world inside this show has a ton of complex lore, strong character development and brilliant jokes, but the characters in this show range from bad to disgusting as the worst men in the world since Patrick Bateman from the 2000 psychological thriller American Psycho. Simpletons would think that it's just a stupid hahahaha funny joke but no... The creators chose this is because they wanted to criticize modern day society and how we live in a bucket of CRAP. A HUGE PILE OF CRAP. Think about it for a moment, we were known for many achievements and talents from Steve Jobs' technical achievements to Nikola Tesla's invention of electricity and Albert Einstein's influence in physics... But we were known for so many atrocities from Adolf Hipster's genocide of Jewish people to Uncle Joe brainwashing his citizens into communist propaganda, this show is a MASTERPIECE OF CAPTIALIST CRITICISM AND DEEP INTELLECTUAL STORYTELLING.

After my death, my husband didn't avenge me.

He fell in love with my killer. He spoiled her rotten.

They spent their nights lost in passion.

Once, when she casually mentioned my name, Sebastian‚Äôs voice turned to ice.

""Why bring up a dead woman? It's morbid.""

Ally smiled, pleased.

She thought Sebastian had truly forgotten me.

She didn't know that the man who came to her bed each night, the man who let her believe she was driving him wild, was a stranger‚Äîa madman, a fool paid to play a part.

And Sebastian watched from the shadows, filming everything.

Then, at her son's christening, he played the tape for the world to see.

1

""Congratulations, Mrs. Croft. You're pregnant.""

The doctor's words sent a wave of pure ecstasy through me. Sebastian and I had been married for ten years, and the childless ache in my heart had been my greatest sorrow. Now, the dream was real.

I reached for my phone, desperate to share the news with him, but before I could even dial, Ally burst into our home with her men.

She shattered my phone on the floor. Her bodyguards dragged me from the bed and forced me to my knees. I instinctively curled my body, trying to shield the tiny life in my womb.

Ally saw the movement. Her face twisted in a mask of rage, and she struck me across the face, her voice a venomous hiss.

""You're pregnant?""

""How could a washed-up old hag like you deserve Sebastian? How dare you be his wife! How dare you carry his child!""

""You should just die! If you were dead, Sebastian would finally see me. He would marry me!""

""Everything would be perfect if you just died.""

Her eyes were wide with a hysterical madness. I stared at her, thinking she was completely insane. I knew she was obsessed with Sebastian, and I knew she hated me.

But I never imagined she would kill me.

I fought, but her men were too strong. They dragged me up to the roof terrace.

And then, with a light push, she sent me over the edge.

There was a sickening thud.

I hit the ground.

Agony unlike anything I had ever known consumed me.

Blood blurred my vision. I managed to turn my head, my eyes falling on the rose garden below. The buds were just beginning to open. Roses were my favorite. Sebastian had planted the entire garden himself, tending to each bush with a devotion that bordered on worship.

Before he left on his business trip, he had promised me, ""Elara, my love, when I get back, we'll sit in the garden and drink tea among the roses.""

Sebastian‚Ä¶ I don't think I can keep that promise.

I tried to keep my eyes open, tried to cling to life, but the fall was too far. The pain was too much.

I just wanted to sleep for a little while. Just until the hurting stopped.

2

Perhaps my death was too unjust, because my soul didn't scatter.

It drifted away from our home, through the crowds and the buildings, until I found myself at Sebastian‚Äôs side.

He was in his office. His assistant stood before him, suit immaculate, but with a faint flush of alcohol on his cheeks. They must have just come from a business dinner.

""Mr. Croft,"" the assistant said, beaming. ""With this new contract, our company's cash flow is secure. I'd like to see that old bastard, Ally‚Äôs father, try to threaten you with pulling his investment now.""

The Shen family. Ally‚Äôs family. One of the city‚Äôs most powerful dynasties, with money, connections, and influence that ran deep. Sebastian‚Äôs first venture fund had come from them. He had always been grateful for their trust, even giving Ally‚Äôs father a stake in the company when it took off.

Only later did he realize the investment was just a tool. Ally‚Äôs father had backed him because Ally wanted him.

""It‚Äôs disgusting,"" the assistant continued, his voice laced with contempt. ""You‚Äôre a married man, but they keep forcing you into these dinners with her. No shame at all. And when you refuse, her father conspires with other firms to cut off our supply chain. If she were such a prize, why hasn't anyone else married her? She's a spoiled, arrogant brat. She can't hold a candle to your wife.""

My heart, or what was left of it, clenched.

Sebastian‚Äôs brow furrowed. He shot his assistant a cold look. The assistant blinked, confused, then asked, ""Sir, your wife wasn't too upset about this business trip, was she‚Ä¶?""

Sebastian froze for a second. When he spoke, his voice was stiff. ""She has a gentle nature. She doesn't get angry with me.""

The assistant‚Äôs smile was knowing. He saw right through the lie.

First, my fiery temper was legendary. Second, it was no secret that we bickered constantly. Third, the assistant knew for a fact that I had kicked Sebastian out of the house after a massive fight right before he left.

And the fight had been about Ally.

3

Ally had always targeted me. Last month, at my birthday party, she‚Äôd ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù stumbled into me, spilling red wine all over my dress in an attempt to humiliate me.

I slapped her, hard.

It felt good.

The next day, Sebastian hired her as the company's chief designer.

The gossip columns had a field day.

That night, Sebastian and I had the worst fight of our lives. I screamed at him, accusing him of having feelings for her. I called him heartless, a coward for not defending me. I cursed myself for ever falling in love with him.

He stood there and took it, not saying a word.

Furious, I threw him out. He didn't come home after that, though he still came by the house every morning to water the roses.

The day before he left for his trip, he told me he‚Äôd be gone for two weeks. I turned my back on him.

He sighed, then leaned in and kissed me gently.

""Elara,"" he whispered. ""Wait for me to come back.""

I had thought he was genuinely softening toward Ally. I thought he had brought her into the company because he was giving in to her. I never knew he was being blackmailed, that our company‚Äôs survival was on the line.

This whole business trip was a desperate bid to find a stronger partner, to finally break free from her family‚Äôs control.

I had been so wrong.

""You can go now,"" Sebastian said to his assistant. The man nodded and left. Sebastian pulled out his phone, his thumb hovering over my name in his contacts. He hesitated for a long, long time.

Finally, he began to type.

Elara, is everything okay at home?

He paused, listening to the rain drumming against the window. He sighed and continued.

I was wrong the other day. When Ally went after you, I should have defended you, not hired her. I wasn't thinking about your feelings. I‚Äôm sorry. There were reasons, I swear. When I get back, I‚Äôll explain everything. I‚Äôll fire her in front of everyone. I‚Äôll make it up to you.

I miss you so much. Only two more weeks. When I get back‚Ä¶ can I have a kiss?

4

Reading the words over his shoulder, I felt a thousand phantom knives pierce my chest.

A sharp, searing pain.

I watched the small, hopeful smile play on his lips as he typed‚Äîa smile full of longing, apology, and anticipation. He was already dreaming of the moment he‚Äôd be home with me.

My heart twisted violently. If I had known that would be our last goodbye, I would never have wasted it on anger.

I reached out, wanting to rest my head on his shoulder. He used to hold me all the time, his embrace tight and warm. I used to tease him, this powerful CEO, for being so clingy.

He would just grin. ""It's not illegal to be addicted to your wife.""

But now, when I reached for him, my arms passed through empty air.

I watched him read the message one last time before hitting send. He waited, his eyes fixed on the screen, expecting my reply.

But the screen remained blank.

He frowned slightly. He started to dial my number, then stopped himself, murmuring, ""She's probably still angry. I just need to finish this work and get home to her.""

He called his assistant back in, and they threw themselves back into their work, a relentless, round-the-clock push. As night fell, the assistant went home, but Sebastian kept going, fueling himself with bitter coffee and stale bread.

I watched him, a cold wind of grief howling through my soul. He was so full of hope, so eager to come home to me, to sit by the roses and read together.

He didn't know I was already dead. He would never see me again.

The thought was a physical blow, hollowing me out until there was nothing left but a gaping, bleeding wound.

5

The next day, still no reply.

Sebastian started to panic. He called the house landline. One of the maids answered. ""The missus is having her afternoon tea.""

""She says she doesn't want to talk to you.""

""She says you need to learn your lesson this time.""

I could even hear my own impatient voice in the background.

Ally had planned this meticulously. She had bribed the staff and was using an AI voice cloner. My fight with Sebastian had given her the perfect cover. He didn't dare push me too hard.

Even if he had demanded a video call, I'm sure she would have found a way.

She fooled him completely.

He told the maid to make sure I was eating properly, then hung up and went back to work. I watched him down cup after cup of black coffee. I knew he was desperate to see me.

But what could I do? Sebastian, we would never see each other again.

And he had no idea.

That night, back in his hotel room, I watched him gently trace our picture on his phone's wallpaper. In the dim light, the harsh lines of his face softened. He was a man who had clawed his way up from nothing. He was ruthless, calculating, and cold. But in recent years, as the company grew, he had sanded down his sharp edges, becoming polished and diplomatic.

Sometimes, I worried he had changed too much, that he was no longer the man I had married. I worried, as the tabloids suggested, that his heart had strayed to the vibrant, younger Ally.

The fear had taken root when he hired her right after she had publicly humiliated me. It‚Äôs why I had lost my mind, why our last conversation was a storm of ugly, hateful words.

I drifted closer to him, resting my head on his shoulder, and whispered, ""I was wrong about you. I'm so sorry.""

Suddenly, Sebastian stopped what he was doing. I thought, for a wild second, that he had heard me. I looked up, a flicker of hope in my soul. This silence was unbearable.

But then his phone rang. It was the hospital.

""Hello, am I speaking with a relative of Ms. Elara Croft?""

6

""Ms. Croft came in for a check-up last week. We're calling to confirm that she is one month pregnant.""

Sebastian shot to his feet, a look of stunned disbelief on his face. He made the doctor confirm it three times. When the truth finally sank in, his eyes grew bright with unshed tears.

""Mr. Croft, would you like to reserve a maternity suite for your wife?""

Of course, he would. He booked the most luxurious suite, complete with 24-hour private medical care. He paid the deposit without a second thought.

As soon as he hung up, he called my number.

""I"" answered.

He was beaming, his voice overflowing with joy. ""Elara, you're pregnant! You have to be so careful. I‚Äôve arranged for a private chef who specializes in prenatal nutrition. He‚Äôll be at the house tomorrow. Are you feeling sick? Are you having any symptoms? Morning sickness?""

The questions tumbled out of him. But the voice on the other end was calm, almost detached. ""Yes, I am. I was going to surprise you when you got back. I feel fine. Everything is fine.""

The voice was mine, but something was wrong. Sebastian‚Äôs smile faltered.

He was silent for a moment, then asked, ""Elara‚Ä¶ do you miss me?""

""I"" gave a soft laugh. ""Of course, I do.""

Sebastian laughed too, pretending everything was normal.

But the moment he ended the call, his face hardened into a mask of stone. He took a deep breath and dialed his assistant.

His voice was like ice.

""Book me on the first flight out tomorrow morning. I'm going home. You and the team will handle the rest.""

Ally had made a mistake.

She didn't know that Sebastian never, ever called me Elara. Not in private.

To him, that name was a nightmare.

7

We grew up together in an orphanage. The director was a kind, matronly woman who always called me by my full name, Elara. It was her special, loving nickname for me.

Then, one night, she led me to a rich businessman‚Äôs room, smiling that same loving smile.

""Her name is Elara,"" she'd said. ""The prettiest girl in the whole orphanage.""

That was the night I learned that her love was a lie, that she was a monster who sold children.

Sebastian nearly died getting me out of there.

After that, the name Elara became a ghost that haunted my sleep.

Sebastian knew this. He would never use it.

He was testing the person on the phone. And she had failed.

Sebastian was coming home.

At the airport, he kept lighting up his phone screen, his eyes full of worry as he stared at my picture. A woman sitting next to him smiled kindly.

""You must love her very much.""

Sebastian looked up, startled. He glanced down at the silver band on his finger, and a rare, boyish stubbornness entered his expression. ""She's my wife.""

His wife, for life.

""And we're going to have a child,"" he added, a proud smile spreading across his face. A faint blush crept up his ears. ""I'm going home to be with her.""

The woman congratulated him warmly.

Watching him, my heart ached. He was flying toward a dream that had already been shattered.

""How long have you been married, to be so in love?"" she asked.

Sebastian didn't have to think.

""We've known each other for thirty years. Been married for ten.""

8

We met when we were three. We fell in love at sixteen. We married at twenty-three.

When we started, we had nothing but each other. From twenty-three to thirty-three, I was by his side as he fought his way from a small town to the heart of the city. I gave him every penny I had saved. We worked multiple jobs, side-by-side, until we were numb with exhaustion.

We lost a child during that time. A silent, tiny life that took root in my womb and was torn away two months later. The pain was unbearable.

Lying in that hospital bed, I wept until I had no tears left. Sebastian cried harder, blaming himself, hating himself for failing me. ""My love, I'm so sorry.""

But apologies couldn't bring our baby back. I told him it was okay. I told him we would have another.

I never imagined I would lose another child, this time along with my own life.

The thought brought a fresh wave of agony. Where had Ally hidden my body? I must have been a gruesome sight after a fall like that. Would Sebastian even recognize me?

Would he find my killer? Would he avenge me?

I floated closer, placing my hand over his, trying to feel his warmth. He had been awake all night and was starting to doze off, his eyes half-closed as he stared at my photo.

I rested my head on his shoulder and whispered, ""Sebastian, I miss you.""

So close, yet a world away.

Sebastian, please find me.

Five hours later, the plane landed. At the same moment, his phone rang.

It was the police.

""Hello, are you a relative of Ms. Elara Croft? We need you to come to the hospital. Ms. Croft fell from Blackwood Cliff this morning. She was deceased when she was found.""",1,1760227556.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1o4akbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/eczema/comments/1o4akbk/theres_barely_research_on_fasting_for_eczema_so_i/,There‚Äôs Barely Research on Fasting for Eczema ‚Äî So I Tried It Myself,"Has anyone else experienced this?

I‚Äôve dealt with eczema for years, and like a lot of people, tried everything recommended on here like changing diet, or finding triggers, I even made a post recently about how not scratching helped my flare ups but eventually it just cam back.

I would find some relief but never actually fixed the root problem, it just made me more frustrated. So, I started digging into research that was actually available on eczema.

A pattern kept popping up: gut health, inflammation, and cell turnover\*\*.\*\*

That‚Äôs when I decided to try something different,  a simple **water + black coffee fast.**

What Happened

Within just three days, I noticed something wild:

* My inflammation dropped
* My skin looked calmer
* And the constant itching almost disappeared

I ended the fast early to celebrate passing a certification exam with my fianc√©e (worth it üòÑ), but even in that short time, the improvement was undeniable.

Then I started reading more, and realized there‚Äôs barely any research on fasting for eczema. Which, honestly, makes sense.  
You can‚Äôt sell ‚Äúnot eating for a few days.‚Äù There‚Äôs no money in it, no product, no prescription. But if you connect the dots between **gut health, autophagy, and inflammation**, it actually starts to make perfect biological sense.

# The Gut‚ÄìSkin Axis: Why Fasting Helps Reset the System

The gut and skin are constantly ‚Äútalking‚Äù through the immune system and metabolites from your gut bacteria. When your gut is inflamed or unbalanced, it can trigger skin inflammation too. Fasting gives your gut time to rest and reset.

Here‚Äôs what the research says:

* **Harshiba et al. (2024)** reviewed 23 studies on intermittent fasting (IF) and skin health ‚Äî eczema, psoriasis, acne, etc. They found fasting can reduce inflammation, rebalance hormones, and positively impact the gut‚Äìskin axis.
* **Bragazzi et al. (2019)** showed fasting reduces oxidative stress, modulates the immune system, and even activates **stem cells** that aid skin regeneration.
* **Maloh et al. (2023)** ran a randomized controlled trial showing that a fasting-mimicking diet improved skin hydration and texture.
* **Rotter et al. (2023)** found that programs combining intermittent fasting with lifestyle changes led to less itching and better quality of life for eczema patients.
* **Melli et al. (2020)** confirmed that people with eczema usually have fewer beneficial gut bacteria and more gut inflammation, suggesting fasting or dietary interventions might help restore balance.

Basically, fasting acts like a **reset button** for your microbiome,  cutting inflammation at its root and helping your skin calm down.

# Gut Health, Serotonin, and Stress

Something else I found really interesting while digging into this: about 90% of your serotonin, the neurotransmitter linked to happiness, calm, and emotional stability ‚Äî is actually produced in your gut.

It doesn‚Äôt directly cross into your brain, but it communicates through the vagus nerve, the main pathway between your gut and brain. This is why poor gut health can contribute to anxiety, depression, or brain fog,  your gut literally influences how your brain feels.

Now, here‚Äôs where it connects back to eczema:

* We don‚Äôt fully know what causes eczema, but stress and cortisol spikes are known to worsen flare-ups and inflammation.
* If your gut is unhealthy, serotonin production and vagus nerve signaling can be disrupted,  which can raise stress reactivity and cortisol.
* And high cortisol can weaken the skin barrier, increase inflammation, and intensify itching.

So, if fasting helps restore gut balance and calm down the gut‚Äìbrain axis, it may indirectly help lower stress hormones and reduce the inflammatory chain reaction that leads to flare-ups.

Basically:  
Better gut ‚Üí balanced mood ‚Üí lower cortisol ‚Üí calmer skin.

# Autophagy: The Body‚Äôs Built-In Cleanup Crew

But fasting doesn‚Äôt just give your gut a break. It triggers autophagy, which literally means ‚Äúself-eating‚Äù, your body‚Äôs process of cleaning out damaged cells and recycling old components.

When you fast, nutrient and energy sensors like mTOR and AMPK shift gears. That signals your body to start breaking down and clearing out junk proteins, pathogens, and inflamed cells.  
In other words, fasting helps your body take out the cellular trash.

Here‚Äôs what the research says on autophagy and eczema:

* **Autophagy deficiency makes eczema worse.** A 2023 *Journal of Investigative Dermatology* study found that when skin cells (keratinocytes) lose autophagy function, itching and barrier damage get worse.
* **Autophagy protects the skin barrier.** According to a 2022 *Biomedicines* paper, autophagy is the *‚Äúguardian of the skin barrier,‚Äù* helping cells maintain balance and remove toxins.
* **In eczema, autophagy is often impaired.** Studies show that in atopic dermatitis, the genes responsible for autophagy and lysosomal cleanup are downregulated, which keeps inflammation active (*PubMed, 2021*).
* **Animal studies support this too.** In dermatitis models, fasting and autophagy-boosting compounds like rapamycin improved eczema-like inflammation (*JCI Insight, 2023*).

So while fasting helps the gut and immune system cool off, **autophagy helps the skin itself repair and rebuild** from the inside out.

# Why It Makes Sense Altogether

When you combine everything ‚Äî  
‚úÖ Gut reset from fasting  
‚úÖ Reduced inflammation  
‚úÖ Improved skin cell repair through autophagy  
‚úÖ Better serotonin balance and lower cortisol  
‚úÖ Less oxidative stress

‚Äîit explains why so many people see their skin improve during or after a fast.

To be clear, fasting isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúmiracle cure,‚Äù and it‚Äôs not for everyone. But it might be a biological reset for people whose eczema is driven by inflammation, diet, or gut imbalance.

# Final Thoughts

There‚Äôs still only a handful of studies directly testing fasting for eczema, but the growing evidence around gut health, serotonin, stress, inflammation, and autophagy gives this approach real credibility.

For me, it worked ‚Äî fast, simple, and surprisingly powerful.

Now I‚Äôm just wondering:  
Has anyone else tried fasting or fasting-mimicking approaches for eczema or other skin issues?

1o4ajz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1o4ajz6/carolinian_questions_greensboro_to_raleigh/,Carolinian Questions - Greensboro to Raleigh,"I currently work (and live) in Raleigh; however, I am strongly considering a move to Winston-Salem for family. My job requires two days in-office per week (Tuesday and Wednesday); I only want to pay for one hotel night, but I also don't want to work a full day after driving over two hours (especially because I'm a nervous driver).

I'm thinking about driving to Greensboro in order to catch #80 at 08:24, which arrives in Raleigh at 10:05, and so I wouldn't get to the office until at least 10:30 on Tuesday mornings. I've already cleared this with my boss, and I even warned him that the train is often a few minutes late, and he's OK with this, but there's one condition: I must be able to connect to Microsoft Teams meetings that happen between 09:00 and 10:00.

Wednesday, I would catch #79 back to Greensboro before making the final drive back to Winston-Salem. Thankfully, I don't have anything time sensitive on Wednesday evenings because #79 is often late.

I'm trying to do my due diligence in deciding if this plan is viable. Naturally, I have a few questions, and I'm hoping that there's somebody here who's a regular rider of the Carolinian and knows all of the nitty gritty.

\- Can I reliably get from Winston-Salem to the Greensboro station in 45 minutes to an hour?

\- Does the Greensboro station have a place where I can park from Tuesday morning to Wednesday evening, and what's the cost? Is it difficult to find a parking space? (Raleigh Union Station has no parking lot, and the nearby parking decks are pricey.)

\- Does Greensboro have a high-level platform with level boarding? If not, are there any plans to install one?

\- Does the train ever get so delayed that it arrives in Greensboro after 09:00? (I really don't want to have to start my meetings at the station and then drop in order to board the train.)

\- Is the Wi-Fi sufficient for connecting to Microsoft Teams meetings? When I rode the Silver Star last year, the Wi-Fi was barely usable; however, I know that the train Wi-Fi is cellular based, and we rode through some pretty rural parts of North Carolina and Virginia. Since the corridor from Greensboro to Raleigh is largely developed, and the rail line parallels US-70, I'm hoping that the Wi-Fi will be more reliable there.

\- If the Wi-Fi is not a viable option, then what about tethering? Does that seem like a viable option? (I have an iPhone 16 Pro Max on Spectrum Mobile)

\- Can I set-up my work laptop in the Cafe Car and connect to my morning meetings? I'm willing to buy breakfast and/or coffee so that I'm a paying customer, but would I be breaking the rules or being inconsiderate if I stayed in the Cafe Car for the full hour from 09:00 to 10:00? I would have a headset, so there wouldn't be any noise from my laptop, but I would still need to talk for brief periods of time. I wouldn't want to disturb any other passengers or get in trouble with the conductor.

\- If I can't set-up in the Cafe Car, or it would be burdensome for the other passengers, then what about in Coach? Would I be inconsiderate to my neighbors if I occasionally had to talk? Out of 60 minutes, I probably talk for less than 5, but it's scattered throughout the hour.

\- Based on my needs, should I go Business Class? Can I use a Multi-Ride Pass for Business Class?

\- Will the Carolinian schedule ever change? Are there any plans for a train that gets to Raleigh earlier in the morning?

\- Overall, how reasonable is this plan? Any other potential gotchas?

Just this morning I got a message. Scribble isn't dead... but.. I..

Nevermind. I hope they have a good explanation when they hopefully eventually message me.

Backstory- started drinking these 2 1/2 years ago when I wanted to get off caffeine. Bought them at a health and wellness smoothie place called sunlife organic. Traded out my coffee for this thinking I was doing myself a solid. Then turned to 2 a day bc eventually I got tired at 2pm and needed energy. Anyway 2 became 3, then 4 a day. I was addicted and finally realized what the fck was in them and that it‚Äôs basically an opioid. 

I spent all summer weaning off and got stuck at 1 1/2 / 2 per day. It was all consuming and my mood, energy , motivation, and sleep sucked. I initially wanted to go on peptides to help w my energy while I weaned off. That‚Äôs when I learned that a peptide for weight loss could actually help the addiction loop that has had a hold on me. 

I never wanted a glp but the evidence was strong for alcohol and nicotine and some for opioid use so I said f it I‚Äôll try it. I found a peptide dr that was amazing and all the peptides come from 503a compounding pharmacies. They microdosed me 1 mg of retatrutide, Nad, lipo b, tesamorelin, and ss31 to support my sleep, energy, mitochondria, and work out recovery. 4 weeks later I‚Äôm a new woman. No longer a fractured version of myself. 

The retatrutide completely got rid of my urge for ff. It‚Äôs like I forgot about them and the other peptides supported my healing, energy, sleep and organs that were likely getting destroyed by ff.

Posting this bc I highly encourage anyone looking for support to look into this for themselves esp if you‚Äôre tapering off. 

It cost me about 2,500 for approx 10 wks of peptides. They all have different cycles but if could chose 1 the retatrutide blunted the addiction and the NAD and liposomal b supported my energy. 

I feel like I‚Äôm 30 again and for the record I‚Äôm 43. 

I had some minor weight loss bc even at a microdose it does blunt your hunger so it‚Äôs important to eat healthy meals and be on top of your nutrition unless you want to lose weight.

1o4adih,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1o4adih/the_witch_that_survived/,The Witch That Survived,"There's always been a vague, morbid fascination for me and those are the witch trials that went on from around the 1400s to the 1700s.



I suppose it might‚Äôve started from the house that was just up the road from mine, the trees that surrounded it looming over the place as it sat at the end of the street.



It was never actually cared for. Vines would creep and crawl over the edges of the building, trying to tear chunks down with useless nails. Wildflowers would bloom about the grass where no one would go to try and fix it up, leaning towards the sun and dancing as the wind blew by them.



If it wasn't for the days I saw that woman fussing about, doing something or other to try and 'take care' of the place, then I'd have assumed that no one really lived there.



But there was someone who remained there. And it was her.



It wasn't often that I'd manage to see her. But there were rare days. If my parents ever caught me gazing as she worked then they'd pull me away and try to distract me with something or other.



Rumours spread about her. That she didn't have anywhere else to go and that she stayed at that place because there was nowhere else for her to go. Some would say that she just didn't care for seeing other people and so she'd stay away, keeping herself locked in the house.



There was always one story, though. It was mostly spoken around campfires, the sun gone and the moon peering down at those still awake and about, the fire crackling, spreading the warm glow onto everyone's faces as they leaned in to listen to the tale the person would spin.



Whenever I heard it, something would change every time, but there were always a few things that would remain in every version that I listened to, and it was this; the woman had been alive since those trials and she had survived it.



Sometimes, kids would go up to her house and knock on the door. See what would happen. See what the reaction would be.



See if they could find anything to say if the story that had been spun for them was true or if it was just a lie, made up to just impress others around a campfire or to scare someone.



I'd watch what would happen, every time, whenever I got the chance and wasn't pulled away to do something else.



I'd wanted to know as much as everyone else did. But I never had the bravery to go and knock and actually see what was going on. I only ever had the bravery to watch from the outside.



When they knocked, she'd answer after a few minutes and smile, inviting them inside.



Some days they'd go in with her. Other times they'd run off or they'd speak with her outside, more often than not stuttering over their words as she watched, her eyes never blinking as her mouth twitched.



Something would always distract me and I'd never see what would actually happen, forgetting about it once my focus shifted onto something else.



The only thing that gave me a clue over what happened was the journal entries I kept, looking back at them after a few days.



Sat outside of the place that I had once called home before I'd moved away, I flick through those entries now, fingers tapping against the side of the page as I look over the scrawl my handwriting had once been.



*08/10/2001*

*Michael Carter went to knock on Sarah's door today.*



*She opened it and he stayed outside for a bit before stepping inside. She looked around then closed the door behind him.*



*It felt like she caught my eye before stepping inside.*



I don't recall ever knowing Michael Carter. I must have, if I had written it down. If I had watched him get invited into the house and noted it down. Like with all the other ones I had written about.



Closing the book and turning around, I grab the bag from the backseat and shove it into one of the pockets.



""How's it feel to be back here, Nat?"" Morgan asks from the passenger seat. I look over to her and see she's smiling, gazing around the place as an orange leaf tumbles from one of the trees and drops onto the front window.



""It's fine,"" I reply, opening my car door and getting out. Morgan follows a moment after, taking in a deep breath as she stretches her arms above her head, the bones cracking from how long we'd both had to sit in the car, driving back up to the place I'd called home when I was little.



At the gaze that she flicks over to me, I shake my head with a slight smile and nudge her arm as I step towards the front door. ""Alright, it's strange then. Happy?""



""Better than you saying that it's just fine,"" she retorts, trailing behind me once she's looked around the place for a little longer.



""Saying it's just fine is more effective.""



""Not with me.""



""Because you like to get all the details about anything going on.""



Morgan hums. I stick the key into the lock on the front door when I manage to get it out of the bag and it creaks back on its hinges once I push it open.



I walk inside once Morgan steps into the place first. Before I close the door, I glance back, frowning as eyes dig into my back. Leaning out, a hand grasping onto the door frame, a curtain flutters from the house up the road, catching my eye.



Pulling myself inside, I kick the door closed behind me.



""You alright?"" Morgan calls over.



""Yeah. I just thought someone was watching me.""



""Well, suppose that no one's been here for a while, and you used to live here-""



""I know that,"" I retort, smothering her words with my hand as I pass by her. She raises a brow and my hand falls away. ""Remember those stories I used to tell you about.""



""Which?""



""I didn't tell that many stories.""



""True, but you still told some. Which?""



""Sarah.""



""Oh, the woman you thought was a witch. Yeah, I remember them. Terrified me when you first told me about them, but I suppose there's no better time for scary stories than during a blackout.""



""It was more to distract you from it.‚Äù



""It didn't have the intended effect.""



""Yeah, well- I know that now.""

  
A smile plays on Morgan's lips and she glances over to me. ""So. Sarah? Is this Sarah Albrecht or Sarah Miller? Or, Sarah Mortis?""



""I've never known that many Sarah's.""



""I have.""



Turning a blank look onto her, her smile just widens and she shakes her head. ""Mortis, right?""



""Yeah. I just thought that‚Ä¶ she was watching me.""



""Think she might recognise you?""



""Maybe? I'm not- I don't know.""



""If she really is the woman those stories claim her to be then she must do,"" Morgan states, brushing past me as she assesses the rest of the space. She nods to herself and turns back to look at me. ""Because‚Ä¶ they'd be all-seeing?""



""I don't think that's how it works, Mo.""



""Well, it might do! I don't think you've practiced anything before now-""



""I don't think she's really a witch. It was just something that us kids said to pass the time or to scare each other.""



""*Natalie*.""



""*Morgan*.""



""Maybe we should go up and say hello to her. Ask her a few questions, you never know-""



""Right, and then when something happens what do we do? Can we- can we just sort this place out? Please?""



It feels unnatural to say it, but I don't like being here. Not anymore.



It's wrong to be here without my parents in the other room. My dad making dinner and my mom speaking with him as she stitches up a hole.



The walls are holding their breathes and the floor creaks beneath our feet, as if ready to open and swallow us whole. Waiting for us to do something wrong and be unable to turn back to the lives we had previously held because whatever we did would be final. And it might just wreck us.



I shouldn't have come here. Shouldn't have dragged Morgan along with me just because I couldn't bare to be in the place alone.



But she's here with me now, smiling softly, the golden light from the outside spilling into the room and wrapping around her while the shadows from the walls and doors grab hold of me as I stand before her.



""Yeah, we can. Hey, I'm sorry for anything I said that upset you-""



""No, you're alright Mo. Don't worry. I just‚Ä¶"" my words trail off, slipping from my fingers even as I fumble to grab them.



""It's alright. Let's get this all sorted out then,"" she says, turning away and leaving the house once again.



I linger by the door, watching her make her way back towards the car, going to pick up the stuff we had brought for the short stay here, until we manage to sort everything out and can go back to our own apartment.



I join her, bringing it all in and setting it down. We manage to get a bit of it sorted until we go to eat and get ready for bed.



The next day isn't much better. Well, in some ways it might be. There's no more being stuck in a car, waiting until we finally reach the house and get inside, having to settle into this place; back into a past life, memories of which had slowly faded with time continuing to trudge onwards.



I'm already here and there's no turning away from it anymore. At least not until everything in this place gets sorted out. Not until anything rotting gets thrown away or anything that's broken has been fixed up.



When that's done and the place is sold, it's time to go. To close that part of the story and go onwards with the rest of life.



But that isn't now. And it might not be *now* at any point soon with the list of things that need to be done.



Sitting on the front steps leading up to the door, I flick through the notes I'd made about the place once I'd gotten up and figured I wouldn't go back to sleep anytime soon.



A nightmare had woken me. By now, I don't even remember what it had been about. But it was enough that I couldn't fall back asleep without fear of falling back into it and being stuck there once again. So I went about, making a list of things that would need to be sorted out if we had any hope of selling the place.



Despite the memories, I really don't want to remain here for longer than I have to.



Tapping my thumb against the side of the scrap paper I had been using, I set it down, putting the pen on top so a strong breeze doesn't blow it away and make it so it has to be re-written.



Taking a drink from the coffee I'd made to keep me awake for longer, the warmth from the mug sinks into my hands.



My eyes drift about and, before I know it, they've fallen onto the house at the top of the little incline. The one with so many versions of a story behind it, it's difficult to tell which is the first, or where it had even come from. Where it had all started.  
  
I take another swig and set it beside the paper, resting my arms on my legs. Shuddering, the wind tugs at my clothes.



Arms wrap around my stomach and I lean into the body behind me.



""Morning, Morgan.""



I don't receive a response. Only the soft whisper of a breath resting against the shell of my ear.



""Mo?""



Nothing.



""Morgan-""



""*Natalie Yarwood*\-"" someone says at the same time, the words ringing through my ears. I nearly jolt at the voice, the breath against my ear rapidly shrinking away.



Blinking rapidly, Morgan's face appears before mine, warm hands resting against my face. Her thumbs run over the skin of my cheeks and she lets out a little breath, murmuring, ""there you are. Where'd you go on me this time?""



""I was just‚Ä¶ thinking. What- what time it is?""



""Not that late, around‚Ä¶ 9? I'm pretty sure,"" she replies, glancing back into the house then over at her. She frowns, brushing a piece of hair away from my face. She opens her mouth, but I just shake my head and stand.



Morgan follows behind me, shutting the door behind her as we step inside together.



Rubbing my wrist, I go into the kitchen and grab a chipped mug, little blue flowers painted along the outside. I pick up another one and put on some coffee, waiting for it to be made.



""When did this happen?"" Morgan asks from behind me. I glance over to her as she picks through the books strewn over the table, a pencil hanging on the edge.



""I don't know. After we ate, I didn't really‚Ä¶ do anything else.""



""I didn't either. When you woke up-""



""No, I don't think it was like this then. And I didn't cause it. Before stepping out, I was looking at anything that needs to be sorted, and you saw me out there.""



""‚Ä¶ Strange. You don't think-""



""Please don't speak that into reality.""



""I'm just saying that there's a possibility-""



Pushing one of the mugs into her hands, she hums and falls quiet, taking a sip. Putting my own down, my gaze flicks over the pages.



It was the journal I was looking through yesterday, before stepping out of the car.



As I thumb through it, my eyes catch onto the ripped edges of pages. Bits torn out by a hasty hand, edges sharp from where they had been carelessly taken out.



The pencil falls and we both jolt, looking to each other once out attention shifts away from the pencil. Morgan shakes her head, running a hand through her coils and picking it up. She sets it by the side of the journal once I close it before leaving, checking the rest of the house for anything else that might have gone missing from the phantom thief.



Once she steps out of the final room, her eyes meet mine and she just shakes her head.



""From what I can see, it's only the pages that have been taken,"" she states, picking up her coffee and taking a sip. Her nose scrunches at the cold taste, but she drains it swiftly before putting on another pot. ""Did they have anything important on them?""



Glancing up from where I had curled up and been slowly going through the journal once more, I just shake my head.



""No. They're only the pages where I spoke about Sarah. Or the kids who went up to her house,"" I say looking back to the one I had been on. Closing the book, I set it down, Morgan taking a seat by me. My head rests on her shoulder and she slowly runs her fingers through my hair.



I feel her head as it turns slightly from where her chin rests against my forehead as she directs her gaze out of the window.



""Can you see anything good?"" I mutter as she doesn't move from the position she had settled into.



""No,"" she replies, finally looking away. ""There was only a few people that passed by.""



Despite how we can't stay like that forever, we do stay there for sometime. At least until Morgan gets up and starts making breakfast. We eat it together then start going about the house. Throwing anything on the floor away or piling things together to go through later.



She has to leave at some point. First to take a call and then to go and grab some boxes for the old things to be stuffed into, to either be donated, fixed, or kept.



While she's gone, someone knocks at the door.



I try to ignore it, but there's knock after knock after knock, so I get up and tug the door open, pausing at the face that stands before me.



""I thought that you'd come back,"" Sarah says, lips pulling up. Her face doesn't look any different from the few times I had managed to catch a glimpse of it in the past.



She had never left her house before. Not when I had been looking, at least. The most that ever happened was just her standing at the front door with it fully open, the house ready to accept the child that had come up to see how true the rumours always were.



But she had never left the house; never stepped outside of it.



But here she was. Standing just before me, a smile playing on her face as she just‚Ä¶ stares.



Ah.



She had spoken to me.



""I'm sorry- what?"" I ask, shaking my head. A curl bounces in front of my eyes and she tucks it behind my ear as I stand there, body tensing as she moves towards me, leaning in, the smell of decay clinging to the edges of her finger.



""You came back, I haven't seen you since you were a kid. Oh, how you've grown,"" she states, eyes glinting with the starting flickers of a flame.



""Right. I haven't‚Ä¶ seen you for a bit either. How have you been?""



""Oh, it's been alright. The same old everything. Can I come in?""



""Well, you see‚Ä¶ not at the minute. I'm busy sorting through things-""



""It won't take long-""



""I really can't. Maybe some other time, but I've got other things I need to get to doing before I can think on catching up with anyone else-"" the words rush out of my mouth before I can really think them through.



Before the door closes, I catch the echo of her scowl as she continues to stand there.



Waiting to be invited inside.



Morgan soon comes back, after that. She frowns when she sees me on the floor, going through pictures that had been kept in a box.



""Are you doing alright?"" she asks, putting the boxes she had brought down. ""You look‚Ä¶ really pale, Nat.""



""I'm- yeah,"" I reply. Her frown deepens when I glance over to her and she remains silent, just gazing at me until I sigh and shake my head. ""Sarah came over.""



""Sarah. As in-""



""Yes, as in maybe a witch Sarah. I don't‚Ä¶ think there are really any other people with that name around here. Even if there was, I wouldn't really know them, so there'd be no one to mix up-""



""Nat.""



""Yeah?""



""You're rambling.""



""Right. *Right.* It was just- I was sorting through things and the door went and when I opened it, Sarah was just standing there. She said‚Ä¶ I'm not sure. She said something first, but I didn't entirely hear what she said. It was something about me coming back, I believe? She asked if she could come in.""



""Did you let her?""



""No- *no,* of course not, why would I let her in?""



""I don't know! I just wanted to make sure.""



""Alright. Well, yeah. There was‚Ä¶ that.""



""Right.""



Morgan takes a seat and taps the space beside her. I take the space after hesitating on the floor for a few seconds longer. She wraps her arm around me and tucks me into her side.



""We don't have to stay.""



""No- I know that, Mo. We can go at any time. I just‚Ä¶"" I pause. Morgan sits in the silence by my side until I'm able to get the words together and put them into a complete sentence.



""I think I just want a final goodbye, with everything here actually sorted out one final time.""



""That's alright. We'll get that done and then we can go back home.""



I nod. She pats my shoulder and smiles. I feel my own lips tug up, echoing the movement of hers.



We go back to sorting through things, the boxes and bags Morgan had brought back being swiftly filled and labelled so we can remember where everything will go once we've finished it all.



""It was strange,"" I absently say, resting my body against the counter as I wait for the meat to cook. From the other room, Morgan hums. A sign she's listening. Waiting for more information.



Something I'd come to learn and love about her over the years.



""She never really left her place before today. Well, not that I ever saw it,"" I add, brushing the bits of hair that had escaped from the braid behind my ear and pulling it out to check how it's doing.



It gets set back under for some more time to fully cook.



""Maybe you always missed it? Or she never had a reason to before. Seeing you return might've been that reason. Or, she just couldn't go beyond the door before now.""



""Mo, that last one sounds as if it'd be something in a fairy-tale.""



""Well, you never know!"" she replies, laughter on the tip of her words as her voice lilts upwards. I just shake my head, turning to look over at her as she smiles, thumbing through a book with worn edges, the spine cracked and pages worn from hands picking through the pages in the past.



""What are you looking at?"" I mutter, glancing under the grill and taking it out. After checking the temperature's alright, I plate it and go over to where Morgan's sat herself on the floor.



Leaning over her shoulder, she shifts slightly so I can better see the creased pages.""



""Old pictures of your family. You all look so sweet together,"" she replies, turning the page slowly, the ones on the next one being of a younger me, gazing into the forest behind our house, pale blonde hair being blown into the direction of the trees by the wind.



""Oh, I remember this one,"" I say, finger tapping against it. ""I'd wanted to go and look through the woods to see what was there, but my parents would never allow it. I think this was the closest I got before my dad found me and took me back home.""



Frowning, my head tilts slightly and I kneel beside her. ""I don't remember who took it, though.""



""Not your parents?""



""No. They wouldn't have took a picture of it, they would've just grabbed me and took me back home.""



""I'd ask about siblings, but you don't have any. I'd also ask about any extended family, but you aren't close to them,"" Morgan replies, frowning slightly.



""Or those that I am close with would have been too far away,"" I add, voice barely above a murmur.



""Strange, then. Perhaps it was took by a neighbour who was outside and saw you there.""



Together, our eyes drift over to the window. She turns away from it first, looking to me, and smiling as she catches we'd looked over there at the same time.



""Do you want to keep this?"" she asks, closing the book and holding it up as if it's some sort of sacred treasure.



""Of course I do,"" I reply. She hands it over and stands, going into the kitchen to finish setting up for dinner while I go into our room and set the book among some of the other things we've decided to keep so far.



I step back out and we eat together. When we're done, everything gets washed up, and I go to bed, Morgan staying up for a bit longer to get some last bits of work done.



Something I can remember is that whenever I could remember my dreams while I stayed here is that they were always odd.



It wasn't often that I'd remember them. For the longest time, there was only one dream which I could remember. But those that do get stuck in my memory are always just *weird* in one way or another. But, I suppose that dreams are just like that. Weird.



Sometimes they can mean something. Sometimes they don't. You never quite know which dream can mean what.



That night, I do dream, though I don't recall what it is. When I wake, I rub my wrist, a frown painted across my face as a dull ache drifts out from where my fingers touch parts of the limb.



Glancing down, a bruise glares back up at me.



I don't remember doing anything that might've caused that.



Getting out of the bed, I change and make some toast, gazing out of the window as I eat it, leaning slightly forwards to peer further down the street, to see what might be going on at any of the other houses.



From what I can see, there isn't really much.



Tugging my hair up, I step out after writing a note for Morgan, picking the opposite way to Sarah's place and going in that direction.



When I come back, Morgan's still asleep, and I get back to work on going through the stuff that still needs to be sorted.



Morgan joins me at some point. She smiles and makes some coffee, settling across from me on the floor once her mugs full, and joining in on going through everything left over.



""You know, this just seems like the place to have weird stuff going on,"" she says, picking up necklaces all tangled together and frowning. Settling into a more comfortable position, she tries to sort them out.



Tries is the key word. It takes some time before she manages to get even one of the chains free.



""Thank‚Ä¶ you? How- what do you mean by that?""



""It's just the vibes it gives off, you know?""



""Not really, but sure.""



Shifting some more pictures, I pause at one, before turning it over to Morgan. She glances up and lets out a low hum, brows furrowing.



""Wow, she doesn't look any older. When was this taken?""



""I'm not sure, it doesn't say,"" I reply, turning it back over, my eyes tracing over my parents and some other people in the picture, smiling and talking, likely not knowing that it was going to be taken until it was done.



That's not what we're focusing on, though. In one of the corners, shadows creeping over her as she sits there, is Sarah. Not any younger than how she looks now, staring right at the camera.



Containing a shudder, I put it into the pile of everything else we're going to get rid of and try to push it out of my mind.





""I think I made too much,"" Morgan says, gazing at the platter of cookies she'd finished making, her head tilted a little to the side, bright streaks of coloured hair falling into her eyes.



She clips it back, not taking her gaze off of the plate.



""You can try to offer some to the people around here?"" I reply, putting away the clean bowl and glancing over to her. She lets out a quiet noise, nodding her head.



""I'll go check now then.""



""What- you don't have to do it *now.""*



*""Right,* but they taste best when they're warm,"" she argues as she grabs another plate, putting half onto it. The rest get packed away, to be eaten at a later date.



""‚Ä¶ Alright, sure, then, go see if anyone wants them.""



""I was going to do that anyway,"" she replies, picking up the spare plate and stepping out of the house, door closing behind her. They smile lightly and go to fix another one of the issues, falling short as there's a knock at the door.



""Did you forget your keys?"" they ask, moving towards it and tugging it open.



At the sight of Sarah, they go to close it once again, *really* not wanting to speak with her at the minute.



They don't get to close the door much before she stops them, head tilting to the side as a smile crawls it's way onto her face.



""Is now a bad time?"" she asks.



""No. I just‚Ä¶ thought that you were at the wrong place.""



""Can I come in?""



""What is it you need?""



""Oh, just to talk for a little. I figured it might be more comfortable to sit around and talk rather than just stand, though. Can I come in?""



""Well- you see, it's a bit of a mess in here and I doubt that you'd want to see that at the minute, so‚Ä¶ maybe some other time, alright?""



""I don't mind a bit of mess.""



""It's really quite bad, you see-""



""I don't mind a bit of mess,"" she repeats, tone shifting into something harsher. She clears her throat, voice lilting up as she adds, ""trust me. I've seen worse in my time staying here.""



They *really* don't want to know.



""I promise you it's bad.""



""Then you can just come over to mine and we can talk there. It isn't so far-""



""I still have a lot I need to get done, Sarah-""



""Natalie. We are going to talk,"" she interrupts. ""I don't care if it's at your place or if it happens at mine, but we are going to talk. There's so many things we need to go over since you've returned. I always wanted to know how life for you was when you moved away. Your parents never seemed to talk about you much once you left. Many of us wondered how you were, or how you were getting on.""



""It's really not that interesting.""



""Yes, well, I like to know what goes on with the people I keep my eye on.""



Her eyes crinkle as she smiles.



Is there really no way for me to get out of this?



They don't want to tell her anything of their life. Anything that had happened to them since their parents grew distant. She doesn't deserve to know that.



No one deserves to know that just because they're curious.



And she had her eye on them?



Why?



*How?*



Eyes flicking down the road, to where Morgan is, smile playing on her face as she speaks to one of the neighbours, she doesn't notice what's going on.



I look back to where Sarah remains standing, the smile still painted across her lips as she stares at me. Waiting for my response.



Waiting for me to agree.



""I‚Ä¶ really need to get this done-""



""I'm so glad that you agree,"" she replies, hand grasping my wrist, her fingers digging into where the bruise sits.



She drags me up the little incline and - even as I try to tug away - she just turns to me and smiles.



When she pulls the front door open, her nails slipping from my wrist, I look down, at the marks where they'd dug in. Blood seeps from slight wounds and, before I can turn and try to run, she's already grabbing me once more and pushing me inside.



""It won't take long,"" she states, door closing behind her, falling shut with a quiet *click.* ""Go on. Have a seat.""



When I don't more, the smile painted onto her face twitches, lips shifting together.



She pulls me forwards. Past the doors in the hall, leading to different rooms, until she gets to the one at the end. With one hand holding my arm, the other reaches to her neck, undoing a necklace and fitting the key on it into the lock.



Pushing me forward, she stands there, staring, until I take the first step down the stairs.



She follows, until we reach the end, and she grabs me once more, humming lightly to herself. We reach another door and she pulls it open, pushing me inside. I stumble on something slick under my feet, falling, my knees crashing onto the unforgiving ground.



I push myself back up, glancing to the floor, a pool of blood staining where I stand, painted onto my hands. Looking back up to her, she just smiles, tilting her head towards the room.



When I glance around the place, I really wish that I hadn't. Bones are stacked in the corners, dried blood surrounding where they've been placed. The clothing these people had once been wearing are coloured with the stuff and hang loosely off of the frame.



""I had to make do before you finally came back home,"" Sarah says, stepping past me, the lock of the door bolting it shut. The key is slipped back under the neck of her dress and she turns around. ""Come on, then.""



""What is this-""



""There's too little time to explain that, Natalie. Come on then.""  
  
Standing stiffly there, she scowls, the smile she'd been wearing dropping into something more disgusted. She grasps my wrist once more and I hiss at the touch, but she ignores it, pulling me forwards.



""Who‚Ä¶ are you, why are you doing this? This is-"" I try to get the words to come out, but they're stuck somewhere in my throat as she continues to drag me through this place.



""Did your parents never tell you anything?"" she asks, pushing my hands together and settling chains over them, the metal rattling together as I try to pull them apart, although I know that it's really no use.""



""No, what does that- how does that relate to any of this-""



""Poor, sweet, Natalie Yarwood. Never chosen for anything much, hm? Always the last to be told of something, apart from when she sorted it out herself,"" she murmurs, almost to myself, twisting a strand of my hair around her finger as she shakes her head. She smiles when her eyes drop to my expression, letting the piece of hair fall away from her finger and taking a step back.



""I suppose I can't blame that, can I? No‚Ä¶ but you. *You* were meant for something more,"" as she says that, her smile drags further up, carving her face as flickering light settles upon it. ""Always for something more. How could they never see how perfect a sacrifice the little Natalie would turn out to be?""





After that day, for a few weeks, there were missing posters for a Natalie Yarwood hung up, a picture of the girl in the middle of it. Asking that if you see any sign of her, you phone the police or contact a Morgan Kieran.



But there's a chance that you never will see the girl who had those pictures taken of her.



Or, if you do, she might look strange when compared to the picture put up of her. Because corpses were never meant to survive for this long, even with the spells someone might cast on them.",2,1760226284.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

A buddy of mine met his current partner through Reddit, so I figured I‚Äôd give it a shot! I've been traveling across the country (working remotely) and have been having a blast. It‚Äôs definitely had its high and lows, and I've met a bunch of different folks along the way -- but finding those lasting connections is obviously a little tough with this lifestyle. Hence why I'm here on Reddit.

Here's a bit about me:

* I'm 40, male, and work in the medical field.
* I‚Äôve been traveling full-time since last summer. I started on the east coast, made my way through the Ozarks, and now I‚Äôm slowly meandering west.
* I love cooking, especially when I can do it outside. My go-to is a cast-iron skillet breakfast hash with whatever‚Äôs on hand -- potatoes, eggs, peppers. Hot sauce is a must, let's be real, haha.
* I'm a big reader. Right now it‚Äôs a mix of Steinbeck, some travel essays, and a book on neuroscience I like to pretend I understand.
* I used to be a runner, but now I‚Äôm more of a ""slow hiker who stops for photos and snacks"" if you get what I mean.
* I grew up near the ocean. I'm not afraid to laugh at myself, like the time I accidentally locked my keys (and shoes) inside the van at a rest stop in the middle of nowhere. Hey, at least it made for a fun story, right?
* I‚Äôm pretty low-key. I'm content with campfires, podcasts, stargazing, and the occasional dive bar conversation with strangers.
* I value good communication and people who can sit comfortably in both silence and long talks.
* My playlists jump from indie folk to old soul to 90s hip-hop, depending on the mood.
* I try to practice gratitude, even on WiFi-free days.

What I'm Looking For:

* Someone grounded, kind, and emotionally intelligent.
* someone who‚Äôs curious about the world, loves learning, and doesn‚Äôt mind taking the scenic route once in a while.
* I‚Äôm drawn to folks who can find beauty in simple things like a good cup of good coffee, a quiet morning - stuff like that.
* You don‚Äôt have to be a traveler (though that‚Äôs always a bonus), just open-minded, thoughtful, and looking to connect

I don‚Äôt believe in financial freedom anymore. I really don‚Äôt. I‚Äôve let myself go. Will I regret it later? Idk, because what could possibly be worse than this excuse of a ‚Äúbright future‚Äù? There isn‚Äôt a bright future and I‚Äôm tired of hustling for money just because I want a fucking coffee. I shouldn‚Äôt have anxiety over wanting to buy ONE thing. 

I don‚Äôt care anymore. I‚Äôm behind on bills. I‚Äôm in school, getting my degree. I don‚Äôt give a *fuck*. My credit cards are maxed out, I‚Äôm late on those, late on my car repairment loan payments, financed on concert tickets because I fucking deserved to go and i‚Äôm late ish on those, don‚Äôt have gas in my car, no money to my name, i work two jobs with little hours because of school. Each job i‚Äôve had has put me in financial rut more so than saving because the job industry is cutting hours, laying people off, having to spend half of my paycheck on GAS. FUCKING GAS. 

Can‚Äôt doordash because gas is expensive. It‚Äôs a rat race and people can‚Äôt afford to tip. I don‚Äôt even judge bc why the fuck would i even want to tip after my order is 30+ dollars because of fee this and fee that? ‚ÄúPeople shouldn‚Äôt be spending money if they don‚Äôt have it‚Äù yea? people want to enjoy themselves for fucks sake. People should be able to buy things they like and enjoy without it costing their whole rent money. 

Whenever I see anything about learning how to budget or buy someone‚Äôs fuckass course to ‚Äúfinancial freedom‚Äù i turn my head. I dgaf anymore and I can guarantee you that my peers dgaf anymore either. 

I know so many people who are in debt and they don‚Äôt care. They have apartments and they are behind on rent and they‚Äôve given up. Good for them! I don‚Äôt blame them! Working two jobs to afford rent is fucking diabolical. 

I don‚Äôt see myself getting a house. I see myself getting an apartment and *struggling*. I don‚Äôt see myself saving any money because whenever I try? I have to take it out for bills. 

Nothing is going to get better any time soon and maybe never. Our country has had so many financial crisis problems and it never stops. What a weak ass system. 

I‚Äôm not fighting anymore. I have given up and let myself go. This isn‚Äôt an understatement. Since I can‚Äôt own anything and everything is a subscription or based on cReDit, i‚Äôm just gonna put my finger up and enjoy life. What else can you do??? I do not care.

1o4acmt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o4acmt,Nekajui - Team-member stay // review and photos,"**Arrival Experience**: When you first step through the casita, you are greeted with a warm towel and a refreshing drink made from soursop.¬† The casita has wood and decor that are 100s of years old, and then you step through to a courtyard that transports you to a village of yesteryear Costa Rica, with an incredible tree that had been transplanted from the peninsula.¬† ‚ÄúThe Tree of Life‚Äù¬† connects the region‚Äôs history with the indigenous Chorotega people.¬†

**Buildings**: If you want to be close to the pools, restaurants and beach club, request buildings 1, 2 or 3.¬† Buildings 5 and 6 will bring you closer to the Nimbu Spa, which also has a pool that guests can use, and are an easy golf cart ride away from the main the amenities.¬† In buildings 5 and 6 you have easy access to the hanging bridge, which leaves off by the funicular to go to the beach, and building 1 with all of the amenities.¬†

**Mantu**: All guests are assigned a Mantu, a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù, who is your personal guide throughout the stay. ¬† My Mantu truly went above and beyond, not only checking on me throughout the stay, but also arranging for a personal note and gift when he saw that I was upset over something that happened at home. Each person in our group received a special note and gift from their Mantu, demonstrating the personal care and attention to details throughout the guest‚Äôs stay.¬†

**Dining:** Each restaurant offers something unique and delectable, and Executive Chef Lulu oversees all aspects of dining and let‚Äôs her chefs create amazing dishes that leaves you dreaming about the next dish. She sources locally and works with the ingredients in the area to ensure the menu is delectable and sustainable.¬† Brisa offers pool side dining with Mexican flair - the shrimp tacos and ceviche were outstanding.¬† At Niri Beach Club, you can enjoy lunch or dinner, while hearing the waves of the ocean.¬† We enjoyed a family style meal with our group, and there were so many items that topped the favorites such as the beef tartar, potatoes, croquettes, tuna. ¬† At Cafe Rincon you can get amazing local coffee, pastries and sandwiches.¬† Breakfast can be enjoyed at Cafe Rincon, Mirador or in-room dining.¬† I chose Mirador each morning because there were so many items I wanted to try. My favorite was the truffled scrambled eggs and the local Gallo Pinto.¬†

We were fortunate to enjoy a Dining Beyond experience, curated by Chef Lulu, in the Grand Villa Suite, with Chef sharing the story of each course and her history.¬† The resort has the Dining Beyond as exclusions dining experiences in unique locations - they shared a story of guests that were taken to the island for a private picnic.¬†

The final night at Puna did not disappoint - with Peruvian flavors coming together in a beautiful finale.¬†

**Cocktails**: For cocktails, seek out Ambar, high among the treetops that offers a stunning sunset view and bespoke cocktails. Look for the hidden door in Puna - where you will find Cooper‚Äôs speakeasy - with elements of the water and sailing that Cooper, the former COO of Marriott, enjoyed so much.¬† The Beverage Director hosted the Flavors Master Class, which was very enlightening and educational. The goat cheese martini was so unique, made with pineapple and honey made from stingless bees - it was so smooth and intoxicating.¬† We learned that not only does it matter where your ingredients are sourced from, but also how your ice is made and the environment in which you enjoy your beverages.¬† Ask your Mantu for the passcode.¬†

**Accommodations**: My room was in building 5 and was an Ocean Vista plunge pool, and was spacious and comfortable. Two large closets gave plenty of spaces for storage, and the dual sinks offered plenty of counter space.¬† A walk through shower led to a soaking tub, overlooking the patio and the lush greenery. The lights and the fan were controlled by touch pads throughout the room, and a bluetooth speaker was available to listen to your favorite music.¬† The one element that was missing was a full length mirror, but that was probably the only flaw I saw in the room.¬† The outdoor terrace was spectacular, with two lounge chairs, an L-shaped sofa, and a plunge pool, overlooking the jungle and onto the ocean.¬† While it was not a perfect ocean view, there was a partial view and you could relax to the sounds of the waves.¬†

Residences - Nekajui has 2-5 bedroom residences that are just a short cart ride away from the property.¬† Guests staying the residences have access to the main resort, and will have a Mantu (or two, depending on the number of guests) that will be able to escort them to resort if they want to enjoy the pools, beach, spa or dining. ¬† Within the residences, guests will have a plunge pool or infinity pool, outdoor grill, full kitchen and all of the comforts of home. \*The team is reviewing pricing of the residences and resort fees to make they more desirable.¬†

The Tented TreeTops are unique suites within the property, giving the guests an opportunity to go ‚Äúglamping‚Äù at the resort.¬† There is an open air living area with a plunge pool overlooking the beauty of Costa Rica, with bedrooms on either side (you do have to cross the pool/open air to get from one room to the other).¬† The bedrooms are King/King, with one option that offers an adorable kids room with a play area, bunk beds and a tub shaped like a ship. ¬† The common area with the plunge pool is open air and was quite warm.¬†¬†¬†

Villa Guayacan - 10 Bedroom Villa. Minimum length of stays range from 5-7 nights, $50-100k/night.¬†  
While the Villa has 10 bedrooms, there are also common areas, a media room, offices, a game room, outdoor play areas, full gym, and more.¬†¬†

**Spa**: The Nimbu spa was truly amazing - you enter into an open air space, overlooking the ocean and immediately have a sense of peace. The locker area was a bit generic but had everything that you would need.¬† They have a sauna, steam room, hot and cold pools, along with an infinity pool, all overlooking the ocean. The waiting space was outside and was incredibly calming.¬† The Flor De Juanilama Massage was one of the best services I have ever received. The therapist offered the right amount of pressure and was extremely attentive.¬† My room was a standard massage room, however others did have their services in rooms that offered windows or doors.¬†

**Kids Club:** Camp Nekajui is for the kiddos ages 4-12, and there is an outdoor play area as well, though I did not see any kids during the stay.¬† (I did see an adorable puppy, though.)

**Activities**: The resort offers activities throughout the week, included with the resort fee.¬† We experienced the pottery workshop, and while you did not take home your own piece since there was no oven, it was fascinating to go through the process. (We did get to take home a piece that was already created, and finished the etching on it.). I also did the coffee tasting at Cafe Rincon and learned some of the different methods and processing for making coffee. ¬† Other experiences included a nature walk, massage class, a sushi experience, yoga and more.¬†

**Beach**: I will say that for someone looking for a beach destination, this is not the resort for them.¬† You take the funicular down to the beach and Niri Beach Club and pool, and then have to walk down a little slope to the beach.¬† They do have breach chairs and service and the water felt quite warm, but the beach itself wasn‚Äôt overly inviting in my opinion.¬† If you are like me and enjoy the pool with the sounds of the ocean it was a perfect experience.¬†

**Overall**: Occupancy was quite low - 20-30% - so it will be interesting to see service levels once they have more guests, but overall this stay received amazing service. While the resort is walkable (except for the residences), a golf cart usually arrived quickly if you called one up through your Mantu. I would highly recommend Nekajui to anyone looking for an escape, and wanting to try something tropical and getting away from the usual suspects of Mexico and the Caribbean.¬†",14,1760226212.0,FATTravel,3,0.94,False
1o4abre,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZionNationalPark/comments/1o4abre/one_day_trip_report_sunday_in_october/,One day trip report - Sunday in October,"Here's my report on a quick first-timer trip. 

**Lodging:**  
I was on a camping road trip so only had 1 day, coming from the Grand Canyon. I opted for a Hipcamp near Glendale. It was considerably cheaper than trying to get something in Springdale, and takes about 45 minutes to get to the Visitor Center. 

Plus, you get to drive on Highway 9 through the east side of the park. They weren't collecting money b/c of the shutdown, but it is worth the price if they were. 

**Getting in and around:**  
Got an ebike for the day with Zion Peddler, which included parking in their lot. I had not reserved a bike, so I didn't have a basket, but that was fine as I had my pack. There's coffee right by it, and then you can get lunch/dinner at the end, or walk over to the brewery.   
  
Got it when they opened at 8, so it the flow of bikes was all one way. I do understand it makes the Pa'rus Trail hectic between bikers and walkers, and I hope that can resolved because those bikes can fly. It's much better once you get to the car-free roads, and it's just bikes and buses.   
  
It really is the best way. You feel the canyon wall above you. You can bop around trail to trail, with no wait. It's a total blast. 

**Hikes:**  
  
I didn't really think about the terrain before I got there, and had brought by spiked poles. It's all rock and sand, and most of the ""popular"" trails are paved. So I wish I'd brought rubbers for my poles, or different poles all together. I never took mine out of my pack. 

It was chilly in the morning, so I had my wools on, and was prepped for shedding layers. I'm glad I did, because it was sunscreen and shorts by the end of the day. 

The park is amazing. Every direction you look is the most beautiful vista you've ever seen, and it happens all day. Here's what I did

**- Grotto to West Rim:**  
I didn't even try the Angel's lottery, and I'm glad I didn't as I discovered I might have a problem with heights! Just the walk up to the restrooms by the Angel's trail got me with the heights. But it's a nice, paved walked.   
  
And sure, it's crowded, but for good reasons. It's a bucket list walk everyone should take, and they do.   I saw a guy pushing a stroller up there, I saw a kid in Adidas slides, a woman in a cocktail dress...And a lot of people without water, which is always a choice.   
  
Stopped at the landing for minute to hear people coming off Angel's Landing in various states of anxiety and elation. And it's true, if you push on, the crowd drops by an order of magnitude, and you can do a nice long walk almost by yourself, further up to the ridge. I really enjoyed that for a while, before coming back down to the crowds. The later it gets in the afternoon, it's almost a steady stream of people in both directions on the path, like a line at Disneyland. 

**- Emerald Pools/Kayenta:**  
Nice little walk, again mostly paved, to the falls and underneath them. Like everything, just beautiful views everywhere. 

**- Narrows Trailhead:**  
I didn't want to walk the water, but wanted to see the trailhead. Also a nice paved walk to the canyon to the beach, but I think I hit it at a very crowded time. The bike ride to the Narrows trailhead was my favorite ride of the day, especially stopping at Big Bend. That was a rad moment. 

**- Trails next to the river:**  
Honestly, these were some of my favorite moments. I wanted some flat miles (as Zion can be hard on your knees) so just doing the simple trails next to the river was super pleasant. Plus everyone takes the shuttles/bikes, so they aren't as crowded. This is where I ""felt"" the valley/canyon the most, and watched the light changing on the walls. Just being in the park is a treat

**The Lodge:**  
I had my lunch up on the ridge, but did some beers at the Lodge during the day and it was great. Plus the little store had sunscreen and a few things I needed. It's a pretty cool spot, with everyone crashed out on the lawn. And really great for people watching.   
  
This is when I felt most proud of our National Park System, seeing the diversity of people from all over the world,  all at various levels of ""outdoors-iness,"" of all ages and demographics and everything else, all enjoying the park and beauty of nature together. 

And that's when I was most angry at any of the selfish asshole politicians who are doing anything to hurt OUR parks. ",1,1760226141.0,ZionNationalPark,0,1.0,False

So my university is offering an exchange program to the University of T√ºbingen for the summer semester. To apply I need to choose some courses that I am planning to take there. Could someone help me with choosing? I read how system of ""kind of course"" works, but I am not sure how much courses I should take and wether they are too easy/hard so it would be nice to be able to talk to someone who knows a bit more than me about all of that.   
  
I need to choose based on course list from previous year and I don't know any German so I can take only courses taught in English. I am 3rd year undergraduate student with major in math. I took a lot of undergraduate and masters/phd level math courses in my university and it would be nice to take even more at T√ºbingen. What courses would you recommend? Also in my university if code of courses starts with 5,6,7 then it's masters/phd level course is it the same here? For example MAT-50-29 from the picture, will I able to take that? I am more into pure math, so taking something like ""Algorithms in Numerical Mathematics"" won't be really interesting for me.. And what could I take apart math courses? I am pretty curious in general, and would be happy to take any kind of additional electives I guess (maybe languages or philosophy or anything). Also is there a way to know prerequisites for courses? Please I would be happy for any kind of recommendations! 

P.S. I am pretty sure I will get into that exchange program, because they usually consider only gpa and I am top 1 gpa among 3rd years I guess. If someone would help (or just would like to meet there) I could get you a coffee or lunch or so! I would appreciate any help or just knowing more new people!

I need to take 24-30 ECTS, something that sounds interesting to me to take is like MAT-50-29 (Algebraic Curves and Riemannian Surfaces), MAT-50-16 (Riemannia Geometry), MAT-60-99 (advanced seminar in analysis, geometry), MAT-45-30. Maybe MAT-70-51 (Financial Mathematics and Numerics).

# What Makes Us Unique? (Lore/Story/In-character)

**A World Alive with Magic**¬†‚Äì¬†[https://discord.gg/u6MYU8g9Cu](https://discord.gg/u6MYU8g9Cu)



Dynastra‚Äôs magic is woven into its fabric, but it comes with challenges. Your OC could be called to restore balance from arcane decay to dangerous magical outbreaks. Discover the truths behind these phenomena, form pacts with powerful entities, or delve into the mysterious world of pact-breakers who defy magic rules.

**The Frontier of Veyradon**

Across the Verdant Sea lies Veyradon: untamed, perilous, and only half-explored. From Azoth‚Äôs cursed jungles to the Wildlands‚Äô chaotic storms, it is a land where survival is never guaranteed. Mercenaries, explorers, and guilds thrive on the¬†**Unified Bounty Board**, where OCs can take on contracts, hunt creatures, and carve their names into legend. Unlike Dynastra, no Pact rules here‚Äîonly coin, guild law, and grit.

**Community-Driven Events**

Our server thrives on community and storytelling.

* **Enchanting Festivals**¬†‚Äì Celebrate life and magic with seasonal gatherings, performances, and culinary delights.
* **Mysterious Missions**¬†‚Äì Investigate magical disturbances, unearth ancient artifacts, and confront dangerous creatures. The bounty board and community board provide quests for OCs to expand horizons and meet new people.
* **Elegant Balls & Spirited Gatherings**¬†‚Äì Form alliances, ignite rivalries, or enjoy a glass of wine with new friends.
* **Combat Roleplay**¬†‚Äì With new guidelines, PvE and PvP combat has opened. From arena duels to Wildlands survival, your OCs can now test their limits in collaborative, high-stakes storytelling.

# A Space for Every Character

* **Build Your World**¬†‚Äì Set up your character‚Äôs home, shop, or caravan. While channel ownership is limited to approved spaces, every OC can leave its mark on the server‚Äôs world.
* **Adapt to Mystery**¬†‚Äì From arcane investigators to mercenaries of Veyradon, there‚Äôs a role for every personality in this ever-changing magic-scape.
* **All Are Welcome**¬†‚Äì Nobles, nomads, seasoned adventurers, and magical creatures alike are embraced here.

# Dynamic Magic, Pacts, and Combat

Magic isn‚Äôt just a tool‚Äîit‚Äôs alive and often unpredictable:

* **Pacts**¬†‚Äì Forge agreements with ancient beings, granting your OC unique abilities at a cost. Will your OC honor their pact or walk the dangerous road of a pact-breaker?
* **Magical Outbreaks**¬†‚Äì Face the consequences of failing spells and crumbling enchantments.
* **Combat Roleplay**¬†‚Äì From arena exhibitions to Wildlands hunts, combat is a narrative tool that shapes stories. Injuries, scars, and even death (with consent) can change your OC forever.
* **Bounty Hunts**¬†‚Äì Join Veyradon‚Äôs guilds in chasing monsters, fugitives, or relics through Azoth‚Äôs ruins and the Wildlands‚Äô chaos.

# Slice-of-Life with Depth

At its heart, Dynastra is a place for everyday moments:

* Relax in the Hot Springs, sip coffee in a quiet caf√©, or enjoy a bustling marketplace.
* Forge meaningful connections‚Äîfriendship, romance, or rivalry all matter.
* Blend ordinary and epic‚Äîfrom tending a shop to uncovering ancient secrets, every action plays a part in the living world.
* Mounts, Pets, and Races are also a feature within Dynastra. Want a lifelong companion you can roleplay as? Perfect, we have a Mounts/Pets submissions area and welcome new ideas for new creatures within the world, as well as Race submissions to give other creators Ideas for their OC creation!

# Your Story Awaits

**Operating profit per user:** roughly $300/year.  
**Equity multiple:** 28x on operating profit -> $300 x 28 = $8,400 base value.  
**Word-of-mouth (peer pressure!):** if each user recruits 0.1-0.3 friends, add about 10-40% -> about $9,200 to $11,800. 

In reality, some people may recruit 5 friends to also do Zyn. Now imagine the value of a influencer using Zyn? It's worth millions, and they may be sponsored. If you see a person online promoting Zyn, remember that. 

Heavy user (about 1 can/day):

* Manufacturer revenue: roughly $1,200/year
* Operating profit: roughly $600/year
* Implied equity value: $600 x 28 = $16,800 base; with 10-40% uplift -> **about $18,500 to $23,500** 

So when you quit, you:

* Remove $600/year in revenue and about $300/year in operating profit.
* Erase around $8,400 of base shareholder value, or around $10,000 including word of mouth.
* **If you're a heavy user, those numbers are roughly doubled: about $1,200 revenue, $600 operating profit, and about $20,000 in shareholder value.**

Your quit isn't just personal. It hits the engine pushing nicotine. One person is about $10k less incentive to market nicotine pouches to the next wave (about $20k if heavy).

Now compare this to other consumer markets, and it gets very apparent how profitable it is to feed people's nicotine addictions...

I am an photo-based artist and writer based in Los Angeles.

Posting with what I‚Äôm sure will probably seem like a strange inquiry...but I hope you will read on!

I am looking to collaborate with local women who regularly sell on Feetfinder for a project I am working on. I‚Äôd like to work together to create the photographs that your clients request (or any other ideas you may have!). You would get copies of the images and are of course welcome to sell them. I am a professionally trained photographer, so they will be hi-res, etc.

Please DM me if this is something you‚Äôd be open to discussing, and I can send you more background on the project, examples of my work, etc. And I would of course be happy to meet for coffee or something beforehand. I recognize this is an usual request, and want you to feel totally comfortable. (For context, I am a 30-year-old woman. I work professionally in the arts and am currently enrolled in an arts graduate program.)

Thank you for your time and consideration!!

I‚Äôm having an issue with my girlfriend ‚ÄúSophie‚Äù and would appreciate some outside perspectives on it.

Sophie and I have been dating about four months. She is a great girl. She‚Äôs got a happy, bubbly personality, she‚Äôs really enthusiastic about making friends and being social, and she‚Äôs the most physically attractive person I have ever been with. So I do really like her and would like to stay with her.

We‚Äôre having an argument right now though because she wanted to ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù me after work last night and I was not happy about it.

So basically, I work two jobs right now. I teach high school full-time, and have a part time job as a bartender a couple nights a week. I like the extra money, but it does leave me a little exhausted some nights.

And last week was kind of rough. Monday after work I spent with Sophie helping her with a project she has in college, and then we went out to dinner.

Tuesday night one of my friends was having his birthday celebration, and Sophie and I went to that and had a good time.

Wednesday I went over to my mom‚Äôs because she‚Äôs moving apartments and needed help moving stuff downstairs.

Thursday I went over to Sophie‚Äôs just to hang out.

So then yesterday, Friday. After school I had a bar shift, but it only went until 9 luckily. After that, I had no plans with anyone, and I was really looking forward to it. It just felt like everyone in the world had needed my attention this week and I was kind of over it.

I wasn‚Äôt planning anything big, but there is a cafe close to the bar I was working at that is open late, and my intent was to go by myself to just have a latte and be left alone by everyone for a little bit. And I was looking forward to that ALL DAY. Just a little time to myself to sit and sip on a good coffee in a cozy cafe.

So I made it to the end of my shift in the bar, and was tired but happy that I could finally just sit and relax. Sophie texted me earlier in the night to ask when I was off. I felt like she was waiting for me to say I was coming over or something and I very intentionally did not. I told her I was getting off at the bar at 9 and then was going home to chill. I didn‚Äôt mention the coffee place because I was a little worried she would ask if she could come, and I just wanted to avoid that.

So I walked out of the bar, feeing really good about my evening, and then I see Sophie waiting out on the sidewalk grinning at me.

She immediately came towards me and gave me a kiss, and I was just kind of staring at her trying to understand why she was there, and she told me she had been in the neighborhood so she decided to wait for me to get done so we could go have a walk around downtown together or have a drink or something.

My reaction was probably not the best, but at this point I had been working 14 hours that day, after a long and busy week, and I started to realize that the plans for my relaxing evening that I‚Äôd been looking forward to all day were fading away right when I was about to enjoy them.

I really did not make any effort to hide the annoyance on my face and Sophie I think realized I was not actually too happy to see her, and I asked her something like ‚ÄúSophie, WHY would you just show up here without asking me?‚Äù

She looked kind of hurt and I‚Äôm sorry for that, but I was also really annoyed at this situation. She told me she had just wanted to surprise me and she thought I would be happy.

Still not making any effort to hide my displeasure that this situation I told her I really did not feel like going out anywhere or having company.

I should point out here, Sophie does not have a car, and so I‚Äôm usually the transportation when we‚Äôre together, which normally is fine. So I was already kind of expecting it when she told me a little sheepishly that she had been expecting to catch a ride home from me.

I of course didn‚Äôt want her stranded downtown, so I just sighed and told her I‚Äôd drop her off at home. Once we got in the car we argued most of the ride. I told her something like ‚ÄúSophie, I know you meant well, but PLEASE never do this again.‚Äù

She was upset and kept telling me that she had just wanted to go out and have a good time after classes that day, and she didn‚Äôt understand why I was so upset about her wanting to spend time with me.

In any case, I dropped her off at her apartment building. I was tired enough at that point I gave up on getting my latte and drove home instead.

She‚Äôs texted me this morning that previous people she‚Äôs dated loved it when she surprised them with stuff like that, and I told her that this kind of spontaneous night out just doesn‚Äôt work for me when I‚Äôm pulling a full-time job and bartending part-time.

I don‚Äôt want to break up, but I would like to resolve this in some way where she can understand that even if I like her, I‚Äôd rather she not decide to pull one of these spontaneous date nights anymore in the future.

I know I didn‚Äôt handle it in the best way necessarily, and I don‚Äôt mind apologizing for that, but I also don‚Äôt want to tell her I was wrong for not wanting her to do that, because I don‚Äôt think I was.

Is there some other way I could have handled that situation? And is there an effective way to end this argument without having to hurt more feelings?

TL;DR My girlfriend decided to ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù me after work on a night when I was exhausted and just wanted to be left alone, and I was annoyed. She‚Äôs upset and now we‚Äôre arguing.",36,1760225245.0,relationship_advice,39,0.84,False
1o49zb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/bupropion/comments/1o49zb7/first_day_taking_zyban_and_it_hit_me_like_a_train/,"First day taking Zyban, and it hit me like a train. Is this normal?","I took Bupropion this morning for the first time, it‚Äôs under the brand name Zyban which I understand is the same as Wellbutrin SR. I‚Äôm supposed to take 150mg once a day for 2 weeks, and then move to 150 mg twice a day.

So I took it around 8:30 this morning, and suddenly around lunch time I felt extremely sick. I had to interrupt a conversation with a colleague in the middle of it and spent the next half and hour my head in the toilet.

After that I had to take a sick leave for the rest of the afternoon, and spent about 5 hours lying in bed in the dark, feeling really sick and with loud tinnitus in my ears.

I‚Äôm wondering if:
- It‚Äôs because I made the mistake of drinking coffee around 10, but my reaction seems a little extreme if that‚Äôs what it is 
- or if it‚Äôs my body trying to adjust and it might take a few days
- or if this is just not the right medication for me

I‚Äôm off work tomorrow and Monday so I‚Äôm thinking of trying again (and no coffee!), but I felt so bad today that I‚Äôm a bit scared of taking it again.

Anyone experienced something similar? Is it worth trying for a few more days/weeks? I‚Äôm having an appointment with the psych in about 2 weeks, but in the meantime I would love to hear from people who experienced something similar.

Also for those taking Zyban, I actually can‚Äôt find information whether there is an xl version of it, which might be a little smoother. It seems that only the SR version is available here (I‚Äôm based in Ireland).",1,1760225185.0,bupropion,4,1.0,False
1o49yfi,https://www.reddit.com/r/POTS/comments/1o49yfi/what_do_you_think/,What Do You Think?,"Hi again! 

I posted a while ago about my ""POTS"" experience (I use quotations bc I'm not officially diagnosed and at this point idek what's wrong with me). Anyways, a quick briefing: I'm currently 10 months postpartum with baby #2 and around the 6 month mark is when i started to not feel good (brain fog, fatigue, shortness of breath, etc.) I figured it was something to do with mental health but my therapist suggested i get tested for my pots. she believed my symptoms were more physical than mental health issues.

 fast forward I had a cardiology appointment & she scheduled me to have a heart monitor & heart ultrasound done to rule anything else out. I also did blood work (CBC w/ diff, TSH, and CMP). I just reviewed my lab results & everything came back normal. i will now have to see another cardiologist bc the one that initially ordered all the labs is not contratced with my insurance. but i'm just confused at this point. 

  
my current state of health right now is that i have bad brain fog, always tired, and have experienced bad headaches the last few days. i drink water often and occasionally have a decaf coffee (today i'm having half caff bc im so tired) but i honestly don't feel any different on what i drink. i've had days where i drink so much water & electrolytes and i feel the same as the days where I drink a coffee. the other day i experienced almost blacking out. my vision started to go black and my head was super lightheaded so i panicked and laid flat on the floor until i felt somewhat okay. i didn't feel right for maybe 20 min after. 

  
for the most part the biggest issue that bothers me is the bad brain fog. it feels like theres a huge cloud in my head that doesn't let me visually focus, concentrate, and get rid of this fatigue. 

  
so, i guess im writing this to ask: do you think this is pots or am i really just going through it mentally? I feel like my mental health has declined simply bc of how awful i feel so idk what came first. reading other people's stories about their debilitating symptoms with pots make me feel like mine isn't truly pots bc i'm able to live day to day with uncomfortable symptoms. 

  
side note: i did an ""at home"" pots test and my heart rate did not rise much after sitting/standing. I also take my vitals frequently and bp and heart rate are always normal. i had maybe two instances where my heart rate rose to 125 but that was after going up and down a flight of stairs and i'm not really too active anyway. i also went to a psychiatrist when this first started and he diagnosed me with ADHD and prescribed me adderall & that sent me to a depressive spiral so i stopped taking it after a few days.  he also prescribed me 10 mg propranolol and i feel really good on it but only for like 20 min and then i go back to my ""normal"". 

  
always thanks for reading & i hope to hear some input to avoid losing my sanity. ",2,1760225116.0,POTS,3,1.0,False

Some back story, his step dad is disabled and his mom isnt in great health either, but are in their 40s. To begin with i didnt really like his stepdad, he was physical with my fianc√© as a child and has caused alot of trauma my fianc√© seems to ignore. His mom was a bad mother too, shes irresponsible and really manipulative. But i wont get into all that mess. 

To make a long story short they were displaced and homeless after their landlord of nearly 10 years decided to stop accepting HUD and kicked them out. After a couple month span of homelessness and no luck finding a place to live, they moved in with his moms friend. I thought that was great! 

We went to visit them on the 4th of july with our 2 year old, and i was SHOCKED at the state of the house. There were 8-10 people living there, some sleeping in the living room. The house was a disaster and it looked like.. well quite frankly a trap house. It was DIRTY, disgusting and looked like not a single person there has cleaned since living there. Rooms without doors, floors and counters stained and sticky and worse. Dishes everywhere. PIPES (weed is legal here but some quite frankly didnt look like weed pipes) on the filthy cluttered coffee table. The house was a pigsty and i cant emphasize that enough. 

Our 2 year old is level 3 autistic, they get into EVERYTHING. They were grabbing everything, it was quite frankly my worst nightmare, the whole time we were there while my fianc√© did NOTHING to help me. Not to mention they have PICA and frequently put random things in their mouth. Even playing in dog food, to which i took it away but was told ‚Äúits not gonna hurt them‚Äù and was told to just leave it alone. 

Every time id keep our child from getting into unsafe things i got looks from the house owner lady, as if i was crazy for not letting my child pick up pipes, old drinks theyd try to drink, etc. To make matters worse i found out from a trusted friend 2 of the people living there were active drg users, hard drgs. 

I told my fiance if they wanted to see us or our child they can come to us or id just drop him off to see them cause he doesnt drive (we live 5 minutes away), which he seemed annoyed but didnt argue it. 

Now fast forward to today and its his mothers birthday, and a fight broke out about how im judging them for their situation and how i hate his parents and that im selfish. This being said AFTER I ASKED WHAT FLAVOR BIRTHDAY CAKE HE THOUGHT HIS MOTHER WOULD LIKE because i was gonna go get her a birthday cake, AND a card. 

I try really hard to go out of my way to be nice despite the several times theyve proved to me they are horrible people, because i dont expect him to choose between us or cut them out or anything wild. But im really tired of him not caring about our daughters safety and prioritizing his mothers feelings.

1o49tww,https://www.reddit.com/r/autism/comments/1o49tww/did_my_brother_outgrow_autism_or_never_have_it_am/,"Did my brother 'outgrow' autism, or never have it? Am I overthinking?","Firstly I just want to acknowledge that 'outgrowing' autism might not be the best term for what I mean, but english isnt my first language and I cant figure out a better way to say it. I dont mean any offense.

So for context, I have 4 siblings, and the brother in question is the middle child, 5 years younger than me. I will call him Clarke for convenience.

We grew up in a very chaotic household (abusive father until I was 12, then just our single mother from then on). I will admit that there was a lot of fighting between us siblings growing up, and this wasnt helped by the fact that our mother was very sick for most of our teenage years, so we were mostly left to our own devices.

This is also partly why Clarke's odd behaviour was never really thought about/why he never got diagnosed. On top of it, our mother, aside from being sick a lot, didnt/doesnt really buy into mental health/disorder stuff. 

Basically, growing up, Clarke was always just the 'strange' one. He didnt really talk until he was about three, only to then pretty much immediately start talking in full sentences (we used to joke he was just waiting to talk until he could do it right). He was always way ahead of his reading level, and would just sit down and read entire books. He was very quiet most of the time unless we were talking about something that interested him. If you really got him talking, he would start pacing in circles around the coffee table in the living room, to the point where he actually wore a path in the carpet and the padding beneath it disintegrated. He was a very, very picky eater, and he couldnt eat food that touched. Certain fabrics would really bother him, and he couldnt wear a shirt unless our mom cut the tag off because he constantly felt it. When he got in trouble/someone upset him, he wouldnt talk for hours. He used to walk around the house in just his underwear (he said it was more comfortable) until he was 11 or 12, even if me or the other siblings had friends over, and not really understand why they would be weirded out/uncomfortable. It took pretty much an intervention to get him to at least wear a robe overtop. He would watch the same movies and shows over and over again. Hated haircuts because they 'hurt'. Thats just all I can think of off the top of my head.

He really wasnt big on socialization, but he made a few friends in elementary school, and a few more in highschool, and they have remained friends to this day, but he had a weird way of talking about friends. I dont know how else to exemplify it, but for example, if my younger sister made some comment about how she has tons of friends but he only has four, he would look confused and say something like ""Why would I need more than four friends?"".

In general, he also had a poor grasp on the idea that saying hurtful things, even if they are technically true, could make someone feel bad. This was an especially prevalent one--he could understand that something might hurt someones feelings, but he thought that it was stupid for someone to get upset about something that was true/unchangeable. 

Clarke started to change pretty noticeably in his teenage years. At about 12/13 he pretty abrubtly stopped acting like a kid, lost a lot of his weird habits and behaviours, and from then on he was very mature and logical about things. He had a very strange sense of humour/laughed at and sent us very bizarre memes, but he wasnt as weird anymore. He did very well in school with math, but always got frustrated with English class because of how restrictive it was, especially when it came to writing assignments. I remember his high school years mostly by him being a lot more reserved, and constantly having an earbud to listen to music, even at school and at the dinner table. He got into gaming and anime around these years as well, and he would somehow be able to watch a show, play a game, and listen to music all at the same time, but be able to concentrate on it all. That was probably the strangest thing he did around this time.

Then from the years of 16-19 he was very, very depressed. To this day none of us know why, he wouldnt say anything about it and would lie when confronted. He didnt cry, he wouldnt say depressing things, but he wore all black and just hardly ever spoke, stayed in his room most of the time, and he just felt miserable to be around. Just the look on his face, and whenever he came in the room it would be like it got several degrees colder. It got so bad that we thought we'd go into his room and find him... I wont say it, but I think my meaning is clear.

Then, suddenly, he just wasnt anymore. It was like he woke up one day and decided he didnt want to be depressed, and that he wanted to be a regular person. He got a job as a cabinetmaker, then as a house painter, then started a solo house painting business. All he did was work, and 2 years later, by age 23, he had his own truck and house. He has lived alone with his 2 cats for the last three years, so I haven't seen him as much recently, but whenever I see him nowadays, he seems very 'normal', if still quite reserved.

This is all to say that Clarke was, and in some ways still is, the 'odd duck' in our family. We used to joke about it, and he himself would as well, especially as he got older, but looking back I think it actually bothered him a lot. All of us were too preoccupied to put much thought into it besides him being weird, but in recent years after autism started being talked about more online, and after having been friends with an autistic coworker I had last year before she moved away, I started looking back at our childhoods with a different perspective and I really, really think Clarke was/is autistic and we just never put 2 and 2 together.

Why Im asking this strange question in the first place is because I heard that sometimes autistic people just pretend to be 'normal' to blend in, and I'm worried maybe Clarke is doing this. Like I said, until recently, we all just thought he was a super weird kid and as he grew up he became less weird--its not as though there arent tons of 'normal' weird kids. However, what really got me thinking more deeply about this is a recent interaction a few months back between him and our younger sister, who I'll just call Kayla.

Basically, Kayla is a handful, and she herself is diagnosed bipolar. She's always getting into trouble, and has several times now gotten into 18-24 months relationships, which like clockwork always end in messy breakups, which leave her miserable for 3 months before the next one. Amidst her most recent breakup, all us siblings were gathered at a family get together, and I overheard her venting to Clarke about her woes while they were washing dishes. He is very good at giving advice and solutions to problems, but he can be kind of cold about it. At one point she said something about seeing a post from her ex with a new girl and being really upset about it, and he replied with ""You guys broke up, why do you even care? He should have no impact on your life now. Just block him on everything and stop thinking about it. Are you stupid?"". That looks meaner typed out than it was said, but even as is, stupid is the nicest thing someone could call her. Clarke is one of the only members of our family who still talks to her/tries to stick up for her even after all the problems she has caused in our lives, his most of all. I havent even spoken to her directly in almost 5 years.

Anyhow, after he said that, she got all pouty and said ""Why are you so mean?"", and he just replied with something along the lines of ""I literally have no human emotions--I'm not even a human being.""*, and she asked what he meant by that, but he just redirected the conversation back to what she was saying and it was forgotten.

Now, Clarke does have a tendency to say very outlandish things, usually for comedic effect (for example, in the years leading up to him moving out, every time he came home from work, he would walk in the door and immediately announce something like ""I have typhus"", ""I have cholera"", ""I have no idea how to read"", ""I have no idea how to breathe"", ""I have no skin"", ""my skeleton just fled my body and ran screaming into the woods"", etc... He just thought it was funny). Im pretty sure thats not even the first time he has said something along those lines*, but when he said it this time it just hit a little deeper in me and caused me to start thinking, hence why I'm now here.

I dont even know how to properly phrase my concern. I tried typing all that out to make sense of it, but I think its mostly gibberish. I guess what I'm worried about is if Clarke has had autism this whole time without knowing it, and is just putting on a face to try and be more normal, but is actually suffering because he feels like something is wrong with him but doesnt know what. Maybe I'm thinking too much about this, maybe its not autism but something else altogether. I dont want to upset him or make him feel bad by just calling him up and asking if he has ever considered that he might have autism, as just from my own perspective, if someone said that to me out of the blue, I'd feel pretty out of sorts. He keeps personal stuff very close to his chest, so I dont think he would even entertain such a conversation with me anyways.

I‚Äôm a 34-year-old woman from Puerto Rico, and my husband is 55, Armenian. We‚Äôve been together 10 years and married for 3. We got married in Alaska (where we live and are citizens) and did IVF in Turkey, which he paid for. We now have beautiful twins.

At first he was very loving and generous ‚Äî trips, gifts, affection. But over time he became controlling and emotionally harsh. He works long hours, smokes weed daily, and criticizes me constantly ‚Äî the kitchen, groceries, coffee, garbage ‚Äî everything. I work 8 hours at our store, then come home to care for the babies, cook, clean, and handle bedtime.

He did arrange an apartment for us to spend the postpartum period comfortably for six months and even managed the business by himself for a year while I rested. I‚Äôm not sure he feels any remorse for that, but I gave him two children ‚Äî what else does he want from me?

When the babies cry, he often stays on his phone in another room. He sometimes threatens divorce and says he‚Äôll try to control me legally. He justifies his anger with comments like ‚ÄúJesus used to throw tables,‚Äù which I find upsetting.

During IVF, pregnancy, and postpartum, he did the bare minimum to help otherwise. He isolates me by criticizing my family and friends ‚Äî says my mother didn‚Äôt help enough, calls my sister a snob, criticizes my brother-in-law and friends. I even lost a 10-year friendship because of things he said. He treats his own mother poorly as well.

I don‚Äôt have low self-esteem ‚Äî I love myself and feel confident, especially after having twins. I‚Äôm originally from Puerto Rico, where I still have family and properties, and I also have about $100K in my own savings. I don‚Äôt want his money ‚Äî I just want peace and a happy life for me and my children.

We‚Äôre currently visiting his family in Turkey, but I live in Alaska. I feel trapped ‚Äî emotionally, financially, and legally. I‚Äôm scared of losing my business or custody if I leave. I‚Äôm looking for advice on how to protect myself and my twins safely and find low-cost legal help.

TL;DR: Married 3 years (together 10), IVF twins. Husband controlling, verbally harsh, isolates me from family/friends, threatens to control me legally. I‚Äôm 34, Puerto Rican; he‚Äôs 55, Armenian. He did arrange an apartment for postpartum and managed the business for a year, but still criticizes and controls me. Married in Alaska, currently visiting family in Turkey. I have savings and properties, don‚Äôt want his money ‚Äî just safety and peace. Need advice on legal help and safety planning.

1o49rtl,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1o49rtl/rapid_heart_rate_occasional_fatigue_only_symptoms/,"rapid heart rate, occasional fatigue only symptoms","hi! 29f, moderately active and mostly healthy. i had covid for the 3rd time a little over a month ago. unremarkable infection -- i was pretty sick but i started to feel fine after 6 days or so, tested negative, etc. previous infections i bounced back on a similar timeline but not this time. i was having a pretty normal recovery but the day after testing negative i started to get super high heart rate + fatigue and it's now on and off. i feel somewhat better a month later -- i had a full week where i felt awesome (last month) and i'll get a couple days at a time where i feel great -- but i'm not back to where i want to be. on a good day i'll feel like i'm at 85%, almost normal but with slightly less energy, and a bad day i'll feel like 40%. there seems to be little to no correlation between my activities of the day and how i'll feel later -- if i wake up feeling good, i will most likely have a good day, and i don't get PEM in any real way, esp if i'm feeling good that day. this morning for example my HR was going crazy but i'd had a full night of sleep and didn't overexert myself the previous day, and taking a beta blocker and chilling on the couch with friends fixed me right up.

my only symptoms are:

\- rapid heart rate: 105 or so when standing, \~110 walking around (will often level out to something more normal like 90-100 or so), and anywhere between 60 (normal, good day) to 80 (bad day) resting

\- hard to catch my breath when HR is high, feeling winded etc.

\- occasional fatigue, not very severe, but enough that i have to sit and rest for a bit. sometimes my legs feel heavy and tired and that's when i know to rest, but after sitting for an hour or so it'll go away and i'll feel better. i overall don't feel like i have the energy that i used to, or at least before this i was able to push myself and still feel good, and i don't think that's gonna work nowadays

HR will go crazy after eating anything carb-heavy, and i've found that drinking a fuckton of water + electrolytes helps symptoms and i generally feel better in the evening and night (prob after a full day of hydrating!). sometimes i get little pains around my heart but nothing too scary or lasting more than a couple seconds.

pcp prescribed me propranolol for the tachycardia and i take that only as-needed -- many days i don't need to take it at all and i don't want to be dependent on medication. it definitely helps and can turn a bad morning into a mostly-normal day. i did a holter monitor for 2wks and it came back mostly normal except for a block that i think was already there years before covid and i don't think it's causing these symptoms, which started immediately post-covid infection. i suggested POTS to the doc and he was very certain that's not what i have (i don't want to have POTS anyway lol). seeing a cardiologist in less than 2 weeks so hoping for more answers or testing then.

i have hashimoto's hypothyroidism but all tests came back normal and i get routine testing done, and it's been unproblematic for like a decade. i don't have hypermobility or anything like that. general bloodwork was normal. it feels like covid whacked my heart... did something weird to it.. damaged it or my nervous system. hard to tell. because of this, i have absolutely not attempted any real exercise except for light walks when i feel good and my normal light activity at work.

i think overall i'm getting better, just really really slowly, and in a non-linear fashion. i want to believe that i will fully recover from this and i think it's possible. i've been masking in public places and resting as needed, but been overall feeling strong and good enough to be back at work and do most social things -- however ugh, i used to go to concerts and i miss having a little cocktail a couple times a week (haven't attempted alcohol yet... that seems like it wouldn't help!!). coffee i've also been avoiding but i tried it on a few days where i've felt good and nothing bad happened!

my question for yall.... what has helped your heart rate? has anyone recovered fully with only these symptoms -- and if so, how long did it take? how is this managed?

thank you for reading and i hope full recovery is possible for all of us.",9,1760224616.0,covidlonghaulers,2,1.0,False

When she first started dating her boyfriend a year and a half ago, i wrote off her her lack of input into our friendship to those beginner butterflies. Over time, we got better, and then again have had ups and downs in how often we would see each other. But for the past couple of months, she has not been trying to make plans at all. She will send a reel every now and then, and that is it. Also, when i text her if she wants to meet, she often waits until it's too late to reply, which pisses me off every time because it's playing stupid.

When I ask her to hang out, she often has excuses, usually that she and her fianc√© are renovating around the house, which is fine of course. But then, when she briefly stops by before work to see her brother (who I agreed could be my flatmate), I ask her to hang out on the weekend ot sth, and she often says she already has plans with her mother-in-law. From what I have gathered, she is either with her fianc√© and his friends or with her mother-in-law. Is that even normal? Trying to turn your mil into your best friend? Every single time without a fail she will mention her and how they have plans to go for a dinner or how she has to text her back etc etc. It takes her hours to text me back but God forbid mother-in-law waits until we finish our conversation to get a reply.

We have been best friends for eight years, but I have often been told that she is not a true friend to me. She moved out of our home country and after a while asked if I would do the same, saying it would be cool to be roommates. I did, but three months after I moved in with her, she met her boyfriend and started living with him. She gave me two months to figure things out before she stopped paying her half of the rent.

Now, a year later, I barely see her. Her brother moved in with me a few months ago, and since then, things have been worse. She will let him know that she is coming over for a short cigarette break before work, and I either have no idea she was here or find out by accident. He mentioned a few days ago that she was planning a short day trip with him and her fianc√© over the weekend, but that he doesn't know if it would happen in the end. Sounds stupid, but, why am i excluded? I have been asking her to hang out for over a month now. However, she did finally agree to go for a coffee tomorrow.

It feels strange that my friends from back home, who I see once or twice a year, feel closer to me than she does, or that people I have met here reach out to hang out far more often than she does.

It was my birthday recently, but I was on vacation at the time. One of those new friends texted me saying that even though we could not celebrate together, a few of them got something for me. My best friend texted me happy birthday, and since then, I have only seen her once, a few days after my bday, when she came with her dad to see her brother the day before her dad went back to our country. Maybe it sounds shallow, but i expected at least a happy birthday card and a muffin with a candle, since her reason of visit was not me to begin with, but her brother.

I feel like it is my fault, but I do not see how. I keep thinking I must have done something wrong after her brother moved in, maybe not keeping the house clean enough or not cooking often enough. But when I compare how the house looks when I am home alone, (he goes to her place when he has a long weekends) to how it looks when he is here, it is clear I am not the one making the mess. And when it comes to shared meals, i cooked 99% of them or we just cook separately.

I cannot help but wonder if, when she comes over and the house is messy, he tells her it is my fault, and that is why she seems to look down on me somehow. Am I being too sensitive? ",1,1760224522.0,relationship_advice,2,0.67,False

We‚Äôre a local moving company here in Windsor (Visor Guys Moving), and after helping a lot of families and students move across Windsor and London, we‚Äôve noticed people often forget a few simple but super important things before moving day.

Here are a few that make a big difference:

1.	Label your essentials box clearly. Things like your phone charger, toothbrush, coffee supplies, and bedsheets, pack them together and label the box ‚ÄúEssentials.‚Äù

2.	Defrost and clean your fridge 24 hours before moving. If you forget this, it can leak during the move (and it‚Äôs the worst).

3.	Book elevator time if you‚Äôre in an apartment. Some buildings require it and it can cause delays if not done ahead of time.

4.	Take photos of furniture setups and cable connections. You‚Äôll thank yourself later when you‚Äôre setting up your TV or desk.

5.	Set up utilities at the new place early. You don‚Äôt want to arrive and realize the Wi-Fi or electricity isn‚Äôt working.

Little details like these can save a lot of stress.

We see these small things make a huge difference for our customers around Windsor and London. Hope this helps someone here get a smoother move!

*Triglycerides* around 65-75

I am fit and otherwise very healthy and my doctors always said it's probably genetic and praised my high HDL. But last year I spent a lot of time in Mexico, ate a lot of greasy food, had a lot of stress, drank more often than usual, so I guess it's compounded and this last August my **LDL spiked to 225 and Apoprotein B to 147**. On top of that I learned my dad has arterial disease, so my doctor promptly put me on **20mg rosuvastatin.**

I realized that last year I was diverging from my normally healthier lifestyle, so I started some changes even before getting the lab results: gave up alcohol and red meat entirely, switched to filtered black coffee (no milk) and increased fiber intake. Also after diagnosis I started plant sterols as well.

I was wondering a couple things:

\- **does the 20mg dose seem a bit too high?** the curve for rosu shows diminishing returns and it seems like 10mg would do the trick + maybe some second line of therapy?  
\- the doctor **suggested a cholesterol re-check in 6 (!) months**. I am reading that this **is too long?**  
\- **does it mean I have likely CAC > 0** since i have it since my mid-twenties? like I said LDL was over 135 at 27 so that means I am damaged goods?

A bit of background: both of us have had challenging pasts and we‚Äôve each gone through therapy to work through some of that. I‚Äôve made a lot of progress, and I feel like my life is moving forward.

We rarely make time for each other anymore, no casual hangouts like grabbing coffee or dinner.

Another thing is that we don‚Äôt know each other‚Äôs families well after all these years, and while we‚Äôve traveled abroad together and had a great time, I feel like there‚Äôs a deeper emotional connection that is missing.

Given Chicago‚Äôs porous defense (more on that in a second) and Montreal‚Äôs first-period fireworks, this game smells like a roast turkey dinner‚Äî*full of potential leftovers*.

### Injury Report: Chicago‚Äôs ‚ÄúWhere‚Äôs Waldo?‚Äù Special

The Blackhawks are missing **five players**, including **Shea Weber** (ankle) and **Laurent Brossoit** (hip)‚Äîtwo guys who probably know a thing or two about blocking shots. Their defense? A skeleton crew that‚Äôs basically asking fans, *‚ÄúCan someone lend us a goalie?‚Äù* (Wait, they‚Äôre missing a goalie too: **Laurent Brossoit** is out, and **Frank Nazar** is filling in? Nazar‚Äôs a forward, folks. It‚Äôs like asking your barista to deke a defenseman.)

Montreal, meanwhile, is at full strength. Captain **Nick Suzuki** and **Brendan Gallagher** are dishing out assists like they‚Äôre at a buffet, and **Mike Matheson** is proving he‚Äôs not just a name from a \*

After split tried twice to get back, she declined, got with rebound 2 weeks later. They‚Äôve been together 2 months.

Issue is, all of us are a part of the same social sports group. I have kept NC, stayed away from events and evenings that rebound + ex goes to and just navigate seeing ex & just say hi. She pretends often I don‚Äôt exist.

Weirdly, last week, she accosted my friend and vented to her about things I‚Äôve been ‚Äòdoing‚Äô. Such as ‚Äòtalking to people I don‚Äôt usually‚Äô at said sports club. Making claims I looked at her emails, inviting people for coffee etc. I realise she‚Äôs being irrational and none of what I‚Äôm doing is her business, but I don‚Äôt get why she went to my friend to say all of this stuff.

I wanted to get back with her, I get she was hurt I ended it but she jumped into something new, I didn‚Äôt. When I approached her about the claims, she was cold, ignored everything I said and just text me part of a policy of the club which states we can all be there as long as it‚Äôs respectful (irrelevant to my text). To my friend had the cheek to claim I‚Äôm doing ‚Äòall of that‚Äô for a reaction (not sure what I‚Äôm supposed to be doing apart from NC).

So why? Why now? She obviously used my friend as a direct line to me, yet refused to engage when I tried. 

Any insight? 

My friend told her she doesn‚Äôt want to engage in further chats about me and did say I‚Äôve been respectful throughout & she can‚Äôt dictate who I talk to etc. ",1,1760223708.0,BreakUps,2,1.0,False

It had an ugly Formica/hardboard top, but really nice solid wood legs and spindles.

I took filling from an old broken couch that I had dismantled in to its component parts to salvage as much as possible and used that filling as the cushioning. (The cushioning is resting on the existing table top.

Finally I shortened the legs to match the height of my new couch and covered with dust cloth and fabric I bought from an off-cut sale at a local design shop a few months ago.

What I mean by this, is that the Japanese seem to prefer to go to trendy cafes with an enjoyable atmosphere rather than the coffee itself. There were so many stunning cafes here, but the coffee itself  always left me disappointed. 

I want to get an espresso machine so I could start to enjoy coffee again. However, it's been hard finding one at retail store. They have options at Amazon and Rakuten, but I have had horror stories with the delivery here in Japan. Does anyone know of any retailers ( Kyoto preferably)  that might sell espresso machines, and if so any brand you'd recommend or avoid? I really like Breville, but I doubt they have it, or online they have an insane mark up. 

Thanks in advance for any suggestions or advice. ",0,1760223532.0,japanlife,11,0.27,False
