1mvzi70,https://www.reddit.com/r/careeradvice/comments/1mvzi70/please_help_me/,Please help me,"I (F25) live in South Korea. I’ve been teaching here for 3 years and I’m a from the US. 

I got married and moved to a very small town 6 months ago for my husband’s job. Honestly? I hate it here and I haven’t been able to find a job to hire me because my Korean isn’t the best. I’ve been applying to remote jobs, coffee shops, anything you can think of and I’ve had no luck. While teaching English I taught myself marketing and graphic design skills to hopefully switch careers cause I wanted to go to something with more progression than teaching English. I’ve had a few interviews with marketing agencies or beauty brands and things go well until they ask where I live and realize I can’t commute every day to Seoul. 

Recently, I had the lucky opportunity to get two offers from two completely different careers: the one I’m hoping to get into and the one I was hoping to leave. You might wonder why I’m asking for advice but hear me out because they both have pros and cons. 

Social media marketing job:
-It’s the career I want to enter 
-I’d have creativity to post for the small business however I want 
-It’s in Seoul (2 hours away) and I’d have to commute twice a week which would cost about $20 a day 
-There’s a one month trial period and if she doesn’t like my work, I’m out. 

Teaching job: 
-Stable income with more pay than the other job (about $1000 more)
-near my house so I don’t have to worry about commuting 
-I wanted to leave this profession in the first place bc it has no real growth 
-I fear getting depressed and settling into this job then quitting my marketing career dreams 

They both have 6 hours a day of work so I can work around my schedule to make my own personal content and do anything else I want on my own time. 

But what do I do?! It feels like a pivotal moment in my life and I’m freaking out so please anyone help…

1mvzell,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mvzell/advice_on_processing_confusing_breakup_30f35m/,Advice on processing confusing breakup? (30f/35m),"TLDR; I (30f) am looking for advice on getting over a confusing breakup with 35m after short relationship of intense start and sudden end. 

I (30f) broke up with my boyfriend (36m) about 5 months ago. We only dated a short while, a little over 4 months. It was a fast and tumultuous affair. 

We’d met on an app early last year but never connected. In the fall I moved to his city and he had responded to a music post I had. I offered to go out sometime and he essentially told me he had to wrap up who he was seeing before. I didn’t know the extent of it so we still went out. We clicked immediately. Similar interests, sense of humor, attraction, good banter and conversation. Right away we were into it. Official after a month. He lived 5 mins down the road so we saw each other every night almost. 

In the beginning I remember wondering if it could be lovebombing. He was so complimentary, told me he’d been looking for someone like me for a long time, made future plans, and was so thoughtful and effortful. It didn’t last long and when he faced some family challenges and a new job in the beginning of this year, it all fell apart. Suddenly, it felt like he was nitpicking every action. If I was late, made a small mistake, didn’t read his mind on his emotions I was inconsiderate and he was condescending. If I acted confused or became quiet, he would ask why I was being “weird”. When i cried, I was too sensitive, too emotional. But he’d stand there and roll his eyes at me, look at me with such anger as I was folding. If I spoke with passion, I was raising my voice. My tone was aggressive. He was so calm. I didn’t even know who he was in those moments. 

He’d return softened and seeming ashamed and guilty but I’d have to step by step explain my perspective. and I’d want to forgive him, my sweet boy. he fought me and I couldn’t keep my mouth shut as he kept doing it. Slowly, he focused on “work”, stopped answering for hours, spent nights at home gaming. I knew it was coming before it did which is why I was so angry when he did it. 

We got in a fight one night and I asked to talk. He called me in the morning and we had a heavy talk but he started saying lines like “I don’t think I can give you what you need” when I’d explain how I was just trying to understand why he was even with me. He eventually said he wasn’t sure he could handle a relationship. 

He took four days of silence to think and texted me. I knew. I got the lines. “I’m so sorry” “you deserve better” “I need to be alone to figure out my shit” “I can’t do a relationship”. But also “I care deeply for you”. When he saw me in person, he said “maybe we could get coffee in a few weeks”. I could tell he was struggling with his decision. I kept asking to explain, I didn’t understand but he gave me the same lines, over and over in different versions. Never what he was feeling, just that he “couldn’t do it”. I guess I believed him even though he couldn’t face me to say it. 

He made a dating profile a month after using photos I’d taken of him. We ran into each other at a bar once and it was fine. We texted and it was an odd mix of wanting to talk but heavy hesitation, I think on both ends. After that, he made another dating profile, using more pictures of us. He made a Spotify playlist with songs all about the pain and always holding onto a person in his heart. They’re all quite specific to our situation. 

I reached out now about 4 months later to say that I hope he’s doing well and sorry for how it all went down as I was really angry. I didn’t need to but I folded. He told me he was sorry too and I had nothing to be sorry for. He shared that he’s in therapy and has a lot of work to do. Told me “right now, I don’t think contact is a good idea” 

All i’m getting at is that I’m looking for perspectives and advice on how to keep a sound mind. I think the two of us triggered some deep seated issues and it’s good he’s working on it. I know I need to stop looking at crap and I honestly was doing so well for so long. I’m having trouble not sliding into the mindset of feeling so insignificant to him and wallowing. And vacillating between being so angry that he won’t just say more. Since it ended, it’s like he can’t bring himself to close the door despite me asking for him to just say he doesn’t want to be with me. It’s always been an elusive not right now and that makes me even more angry than feeling dismissed. I’ve spent some really good time healing this summer and spending time with friends. I started dating slowly again and have met some really sweet guys. Processing this has been a wild ride and I have my own anxious attachments to wrk through.

I am laying in bed with my border collie right now and thinking about how much I love her and how quickly time has flown. I was reflecting on border collie stereotypes and what surprised me the most about owning her these past four years. 

When I adopted her as a puppy from a foster family in Brooklyn, I had an idea of what it would entail but didn’t fully know. I thought it was going to be hours of physical exercise, tons of mental stimulation, and non-stop go go go. And yes she does get enough of everything, those are all important. But what blew me away, is what she needs the most is her connection with me. What she thrives on is affection and me treating her as an equal and with respect and just so much love (love in the way SHE feels comfortable receiving love). Simply connecting with her as a sentient being, and being there for her through everything, working through fears with her, being kind to her, playing with her in the way she wants to play. And basically doing anything in my power to listen to and understand her.  She is unreal. I think this goes for any breed but especially border collies. The most stimulating thing for her is affection and love and being by my side as we explore the world together. 

I work from home and live in a city (I know there’s a stereotype around BCs in a city), but let me tell you, she is my partner in crime wherever I go. She thrives on experiencing life with me, making memories, and having fun together. Yes of course there are things that make her nervous sometimes, and guess what? We work through those things at her own pace. She sniffs EVERYTHING. interacts with people on a daily basis, travels to breweries, coffee shops, literally everywhere with me, and she loves it. And if something is ever too overstimulating or scary, we’re out. 

I guess what I’m saying is, the bond you have with a BC is unlike anything you’ll experience in this lifetime, especially when you love, respect, and treat them as an equal. And THAT is what they crave the most. And I wasn’t expecting that. She is my ride or die, and more importantly, she knows I am her ride or die. 

I fall more in love with this dog everyday. Someone please save me bc idk how my heart hasn’t exploded after four years together ❤️

So much love to all of the border collies and BC owners out there who are doing the work, especially the emotional connection work. They are the biggest blessing you will ever receive. 

P.S. tell your dog you love them every single day multiple times a day, and mean it. They absolutely know what we are saying when we slow down and communicate with intention and love xoxox",3,1755744240.0,BorderCollie,0,1.0,False

1mvz4tv,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mvz4tv/the_scarlet_letter_entry_5_burlington_to_eden/,The Scarlet Letter (Entry 5: Burlington To Eden),"I got up and proceeded to get ready like I do every morning: brush my teeth, shave my face of any facial hair, shower, get dressed, and mentally make a checklist of things that need to be done. Today’s list was fairly simple: get gas for the car, maybe get coffee in preparation for a long day, then take the one-hour drive to Eden.

After I was done showering, I was surprised to find Leah standing in the bathroom waiting for me.

“Yes? Can I help you?”

“I’m going with you.”

She looked determined and ready for an argument, but I was unwilling and unable to think of a reason not to take her—beyond the obvious corpse that was awaiting me in the backyard of my childhood home.

“Yeah, sure. I could use the company, honestly.”

“Oh… I think I was expecting more of a fight.”

“Oh, for sure, normally I probably would’ve. But I think I shouldn’t be alone.”

Her demeanor changed. The usually soft, pretty, and somewhat awkward Leah I knew had turned into someone determined and confident—a side of her I don’t think I had ever known.

“I made coffee and got you breakfast. Clothes are on the bed, and the car is packed and good to go.”

“Geez, did you leave anything for me to do?”

She started to open the door and walked out before looking back. In a weird tone of voice—almost menacing and off-putting—she added:

“Let’s just get this over with so we can go back home.”

Who pissed in her cereal bowl? Maybe she’s mad I manipulated her to come here? Fuck her, stupid bitch. It’s my own fault. I made her this way, and I think she might be cynical because of how I’ve been using her to fill a void within myself. She’ll learn to move on from me. I hope.

⸻

I dried myself off with a towel and felt my ribs again, this time looking in the mirror. Yeah, they’re absolutely broken. What kind of dream makes things happen in real life? I don’t have time for this—I just want to get it over with.

I went into the bedroom and saw the clothes she had laid out for me: light green summer shorts, a white undershirt, and a button-up shirt with a floral design. Guess we are going light-colored today. Leah has a better sense of style than I could ever hope to have.

If I had my way, I’d wear black slacks and a white dress shirt with the sleeves rolled up to my elbows every day. I’m simple. I like that. But she does know how to make me look good. The shirt was a little tight, but it showed off my physique, which was a plus. On top of that, it was pretty light and allowed me to move around easily.

Grabbing my keys, I left the apartment, looking around one more time in case anything was left behind—either on purpose or by accident.

⸻

Leah was already waiting in my car. She sat in the passenger seat with her legs up on the dash, the convertible top down and the light hitting her perfectly. Just looking at her smooth, lightly sun-kissed legs made me aroused.

She sat there in her daisy dukes and a white button-up cut-off shirt, wearing a raffia sun hat and sunglasses to keep the sun from her face. Her bare feet had black nail polish on the toes.

The only imperfections were the things I could relate to the most about her. On her inner thigh lay several deep, dark purple marks leading up toward her pelvis. I had counted them before, when we lay naked together at my apartment. Twenty-four in total.

I couldn’t help but stare at her from the door, like I was a voyeur peering through a window, catching a glimpse of something I shouldn’t. The view looked straight out of one of those cheesy-ass rom-coms I disdain.

Maybe I don’t want her to move on. Maybe I want her more than I realize. I don’t have the time for this.

⸻

I walked toward the car and looked in to make sure everything was there. Before I could even open the door, a bag of pills was thrown at me.

“I got those for you before I left. Don’t say I don’t do anything for you. You need to quit before you kill yourself.”

I wanted to say something awful back, but something held me back. Probably the way she looked. I couldn’t help but be nice in return.

“I know. Thank you.”

“Don’t mention it. And if anyone at work asks, you got those on your own.”

I sifted through the baggie to find Xanax, Ritalin, Percs, Vicodin, and better yet, fentanyl. She would be fired and immediately arrested if she got caught stealing these. I couldn’t help but smile before taking one of the Percs and letting it melt on my tongue, then taking a sip from my water bottle to wash it down.

I sat in the driver’s seat and waited for the wave to crash into me. I loved the feeling of being high. It was the only way I felt alive anymore.

She looked at me and smacked her teeth in disgust.

“Don’t fucking kill me, okay?”

“I know what I’m doing. Just keep looking beautiful.”

“Yeah, whatever, man. Let’s just get going.”

I could tell that she was growing more and more impatient with me—almost like she hated me now, and probably rightfully so. I didn’t care. I just wanted to have whatever discussion she wanted so I could bend her over and fuck her on my kitchen table.

⸻

I started the car, and to my surprise the gas tank was full.

“You’re welcome,” I heard from the passenger side.

“How much?”

“Consider it a condolence gift for the funeral.”

I shrugged and didn’t want to fight, so I turned the wheel and we headed off.

⸻

Summer in Vermont is beautiful. The trees are back to life, and the countryside is vibrant and colorful as ever. The air smells fresh and clean, away from the cities. Hell, even Burlington has a beautiful sight and smell to it.

We—and by “we” I mean I—decided to take the scenic route. It would’ve been the same distance and time as the highway, so fuck it. Why not, yeah? I’m sure Leah has never been here because she’s a big-city girl. From Miami, to be exact.

I have a paper copy of her license. I may have also gone through her wallet for the occasional twenty-dollar bill every once in a while. I never said I was a saint….

⸻

“Hey, so I think we could have that talk now.”

Really? Now of all times? Alright, let’s see how this goes…

“Okay, sure. What’s on your mind?”

Leah twirled a strand of her silky, vibrant black hair between her fingers as a way to alleviate the obvious stress and discomfort on her mind.

“Look, we’ve had fun. Lots of fun, even. I’m not getting any younger, though, and I want something real.”

Great. Just my luck. The whole “I’m almost thirty and I need to think about the future” talk. Leah turned to me, her legs swiping off the dashboard.

“I want you. Badly. And I need to know you feel the same. But I want it to be exclusive, and if you can’t do that then let’s call a spade a spade. Right here, right now.”

The guilt burning inside of me told me to call it off and do the right thing. Even if I said yes, there was no promise of this being anything other than me getting my dick wet. However, that’s not what left my mouth. It shocked me a little when I told her:

“I haven’t felt this way about anyone before. I think I love you.”

She sat there, her mouth gaped open. What had I just done? My mind was racing, and it was as if I had crashed the car and time stood still. Like I had slipped into a coma and was the only one able to move.

“You do?”

She broke the silence. I saw her face turn from a lovely hue of pink to a red shade of embarrassment.

“I have always loved you, Leah. I wouldn’t have asked you up here if I didn’t.”

What the fuck is going on? Stop talking, you dumbass.

“I guess then I don’t have to talk much more. I’m sorry I doubted you.”

Leah looked almost completely satisfied. I could tell that I had just done something absolutely disgusting and betrayed any chance of trust I may have had with her. Her legs went right back onto the dashboard, and she started humming. She smiled with a sincere look of content, and I swore that she looked as if she was glowing.

⸻

My mind raced with what I had just done. I felt betrayed by even myself. We must’ve talked the entire way up, because I don’t even know what happened to that hour of driving. Leah pointed out all the animals along the way, the open mountain ranges, the hillside farms, the general stores, and the old beat-to-shit trucks that were parked in their lots.

It was cute, to be fair, and she genuinely loved everything about the drive. I could tell that if she just took me seriously like I think she did about love…

I’m moving back home.

Do you want to have A family around, just not Your family? Our two-parent, two-teen household is spilling into a second apartment in our building. There's a guest room we'll use, an open bedroom (that's you), lots of shared space, and a little washer and dryer.

Foot traffic: None of us are your full-time roommate, but your room is in our home, and all 4 of us will be in and out, working from the guest room, doing laundry, etc. Sometimes one of us will sleep over for a weekend. Sometimes a kid will hang around watching youtube (with earbuds). This is a bedroom in a family home, but none of us currently sleep there full-time, so you would be the main person with shampoo in the shower. We are not a party crew, and we are glad to keep quiet as a default setting. 

The room: The room is 12 by 15 feet, 180sf, though some of that is taken up by a six-foot wide, 30-inch deep closet that goes up to the 9-foot ceiling. That leaves 165 sf of open floor. There are two sunny west/southwest facing windows. They look out on multi-lane traffic, although it's 60+ feet away, plus a lot of trees and sky. Unfurnished. We can take you to ikea if you want to pick stuff out. The wood floors are nice, but a building rule requires rugs over 80% of them to reduce noise.

Shared spaces: The living room, kitchen, and bath are shared. There isn’t a tv in the living room, or shelving, or decor, and for us that’s good, that's minimalism. We'll be in and out of the bathroom and kitchen. We’ll store stuff in the kitchen and cook there sometimes, but it’s not our 12-meals-a-day cooking environment.

Utilities: We just put in a new bedroom window a/c. In heat season you will more likely be too warm than too cold—steam radiators. Half of gas, electric, and wifi is about 75/month. Maybe higher now that there's a/c?

Building: The building is a family-oriented walkup coop, fairly diverse, and lgbt friendly. There are multiple outdoor spaces, including front yard and courtyard, plus a long, skinny back courtyard (or is it an alley?) where people do some veg gardening. Take a raised bed, there are extra ones. The front yard is mostly decorative, but the courtyard is comfortable. There’s a bigger laundry room in the basement. And just to repeat the word walkup again, it’s a walkup. Building quiet hours are 10pm to 9am, and we have to take them seriously because the super lives directly below us.

Neighborhood: You can walk around the block and hit laundromats, delis, coffee, and basic takeout without crossing the street. More coffee, some bars, and a bookstore within a few blocks. Bigger grocery stores and more serious restaurants 5-10 minutes walk. Ten minutes in either direction to Greenwood Cemetery or Prospect Park.

Transit: We are 0.3 miles to either the Fort Hamilton F/G (the directions say 8-minute walk ) or Church Ave F/G (9 minutes). The B and D are farther, 0.7 miles (16 minutes), but the bus can often get to them faster than that. There are also express buses to lower Manhattan that get on the highway after our block and go nonstop. There are two Citibike racks within a block. 

About us: Nerds for sure. Our current employers include: a bookstore, a publisher, a parenting group. The kids are pretty mild for teenagers. So far.

About you: We enjoy students and artists, and we plan to enjoy meeting you, whoever you are. We'll have to collaborate on cleaning—are you ok to collaborate on cleaning? And you'd have to live with our varied schedules and with kids. You ok with kids?

Long-range stayability: If you were happy here and wanted to stay, it’s possible to get past the building’s two-year sublet limit. If any one of our hosting family eventually lived full-time in the guest room, then you could legally switch from a ""sublet"" to a longer-term ""roommate.""

Photo footnote: Please disregard the construction dust. Also the bathroom isn't bad at all, just not photogenic right now.

Possibles and impossibles: Couples, impossible. Loudness or hosting hookups or parties, also impossible. Small, lovely neutered dogs maybe possible? Cats, impossible (allergies). Basement bike storage possible. Smoking, impossible.

How-to: Because we’re a family and because it’s a coop building, this takes more oomph than an average shared rental.

Steps:  1. Come see if it’s any kind of match. 2. If so, meet the kids. Facetime or zoom is fine for that. 3. If that works, we'll send you the application form. 4. Enter the paperwork tunnel: Do you have two school or work-related recommendation letters? Great, PDF them. If not, have a boss and/or family friend write some. Filed taxes? Great, attach the top page. Ditto bank statements. Ditto pay stubs. 5. Send it all back and the board will approve it. (We're on the board.) 6. Sign a lease

**Context:**

I wanted to mark my last week living in New York City with something unforgettable, and an evening at Per Se felt like the right choice. I already had a sentimental connection to Columbus Circle with the same golden-hour view of Central Park I’ve admired from the Lincoln Center Jazz venues just a floor above. Eleven Madison Park was still mid-all-vegan era when I was booking, so Per Se stood out, especially with its reputation for flawless service.

So, a day later, I want to share my experience (at some length) as someone still relatively new to fine dining—having now lived through what I expected, and can now perhaps believe, represents some of the very best it has to offer!

Starting off with **service**, which stood out immediately as levels above any Michelin-starred establishment I've dined, upon entering through blue doors. Every member of staff was incredibly warm and attentive. I noticed that water was deliberately placed *out* of arm's reach at each table, finding my glass refilled even after single sips, often from a freshly swapped carafe. After the first course, the staff noted my left-handedness and quietly reset glasses and silverware for the remainder of service.

[Seated at a couch table. From images, I had meager expectations for the dining room but it's truly stunning in person...](https://preview.redd.it/5krzt81qk9kf1.jpg?width=3926&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=4ba56c5075a84fc5377cf7f618240c4cc8e67c17)

**The Food:**

[Salmon Cornetto](https://preview.redd.it/mg04tyiml9kf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9b8cf8d20304e7c3e5d7cfb8cfc7448d9e513af7)

[More Amuses ](https://preview.redd.it/dcjcnuhol9kf1.jpg?width=5830&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=689c4d1299d84135508f544e8c41c1ccd92008be)

The amuses arrived first. The signature salmon cornette, plus a mysterious wagyu bite and a green tart (?). Familiar flavors but executed soo well. Crunchy, decadent, and playful. All three servings complemented each other in the best way possible offering a unique balance of textures, visual creativity, and color. Five bites in, I knew I was in for something special. **9.6/10**

[Chilled Avocado Velouté](https://preview.redd.it/i510n5rfm9kf1.jpg?width=5738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d1e7a8b2641bd7b3484f6ff2ab4c75613e90eb09)

Once the initial dishes cleared, I was somewhat surprised by a single silver spoon placed on my table, betraying the bubbling expectations of the signature dish. What arrived was a complimentary green, soup-like wonder. Served with added turnips, and acidity from lime, this was an extremely refreshing, smooth, and inviting first course of the evening! **9/10**

[\\""Oysters and Pearls\\""](https://preview.redd.it/yj892qvjn9kf1.jpg?width=4958&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=494cbc2ecf02f715e3ec39d055a588bc3437c837)

Ah, here she was, ***the*** dish I’d heard so much about. Very much hyped for a reason; I think what stood out the most for me was the contrast of temperatures between the oysters, tapioca, bridged together beautifully with the caviar. Presentation was flawless. Flavor-wise, maybe not as flamboyant as legend suggests (and I’ll admit, caviar might still be a little lost on me) but with every bite, I feel my pupils dilate *more* and *more* and *more*... psychedelic. Perfect! **11/10.**

[Hen Egg Custard](https://preview.redd.it/lpsfnhvep9kf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f3eea9f58eb8cfc2f842cb38563eed9c677d575)

Another complimentary dish, which arrived with the ascertained confidence that I will, in fact, be spoilt tonight. Truly as good as the dish before, and the best rendition of eggs I've ever experienced. The bottom third of the potato chip was a pinch soggy, a trivial mental note burried below the remarkable umami flavors of truffle. Happy to admit I scraped every yellow-black inch inside the egg shell (how'd they cut it like that anyway?) **10/10.**

[Squash Terrine, served with Bread & Butter](https://preview.redd.it/7lv9i1jjq9kf1.jpg?width=5729&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8bbe0c736f9b4a2fffa80435cbd56935a72b4623)

Skipped the Foie Gras supplement, and not disappointed! Interesting flavors, the yellow sauce came out with such piercing colors, and my dilated pupils continued a now-established ritual. **9.5/10**

The cornbread with Hilary Haigh butter… my goodness. Is this not the best bread on the planet? A title I was convinced belonged to The Four Horsemen across the East River. Please, just give me a double serving haha. **10/10**.

[Japanese Hiramasa Sashimi](https://preview.redd.it/y91cgqnmr9kf1.jpg?width=5321&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9de4028f0fe758c85dc2cdbbb69c9ca1ffc63980)

Fresh and texturally perfect. I think a standout highlight of Chef Keller's philosophy of letting the ingredients shine. Each component was so beautifully prepped. I'm sadly not the biggest fan of cucumber flavor, which came through from the compressed cucamelons, and double sadly Per Se could not convince me otherwise, *per se*. But that's all good, this was fantastic! **8.8/10**.

[ awesome!](https://preview.redd.it/5kbx83hxs9kf1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7029c872001248e7c45fb367ad1bdf6f09dca61e)

*By now, I'm noticing Per Se has revamped their plating and crockery with consistent clean white and silver, away from the turquoise-gold baroque I've seen in reviews past (maybe they change it out for second service?). Anyways, I was a huge fan!*

[Lobster Course](https://preview.redd.it/k1am5cx8t9kf1.jpg?width=3990&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=eef657f3a2602f944191cfb3a3f0a8a062444efe)

**10/10.** Truly magnificent, otherworldly, unforgettable. The green components and sauces didn’t quite hit for me—they clashed a bit with the piperade. The baguette crisp was enjoyable, but not remarkable. But the main pool of sauce… with the lobster. Holy f*cking sh*t, excuse my French. What *was* in that?

***What is this sauce?***

By now, I noticed I hadn’t had a chance to chat with my main waiter about the last four courses. I just wanted to put my thoughts somewhere, share some of my admiration, and now, curiosity. As my stomach slowly filled crossing the latter half of the tasting menu, this feeling kept softly nagging at me, though I’m not quite sure if it was anyone's fault, exactly.

Excellent, but one of the lesser memorable dishes of the night. Everything worked *well*, but nothing standout. **8.5/10**

[Lamb Course](https://preview.redd.it/ljeoe1qlz9kf1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=31054b9f35873ef87c1ffecd5389f47371c1ea6a)

Hmm, things got a bit wobbly here. After the absolute high of the lobster, I had sky-high expectations for the final red meat course. The lamb arrived beautifully plated, medium-rare—but oddly cold. A second small bite confirmed my suspicion. I finally noticed my waiter discreetly lingering for my reaction, so I pulled him aside. He explained the sous-vide lamb may sometimes be lukewarm—but later, I overheard him asking arriving guests if they’d prefer their lamb cooked a bit more. I had to push a little, and was offered a redo.

The redo came out on a blazing hot plate, unlike the first, but now the lamb was slightly overcooked to a chewy medium. Definitely an overcorrection, and the mushroom/eggplant pairing didn’t do much to redeem it. **6.5/10**

I don't know, maybe my palette wasn't refined enough to fully enjoy the first take. Still, I also didn't feel great sending this back, especially since I hadn't shared my delight in the previous 4 or 5 courses with the waiter, and led with a complaint.

It was good, lovely lovely plating, though I'm a little afraid to admit that my full enjoyment of the pre-dessert was soured by the course prior. **8/10**

* Popcorn Sorbet — Completed beautifully by the Raspberry  **9.5/10**
* Coffee & Donuts — Honestly? They should open a donut shop. The best I’ve ever had. Can't say the same for the Cappuccino Semifreddo. Still, a sincerely playful and memorable addition  **9.7/10**
* Chocolate Marshmallow Cake — Just okay, mostly because I am extremely full at this point. Love the touch of the skyline. **8/10**
* Choux Pastry “Cream Puff” (not really a cream puff) — Skippable for me, Creme Fraiche was way too heavy at this point, having been advised to enjoy these desserts in this listed order.
* Crème Brûlée Macaron — ""hold on a minute...""  **10.5/10**
* Decaf Americano — 2nd best coffee I've had in the city, dessert would be unfinishable without a cup. **10/10**

**Kitchen Tour!**

After a few final minutes savoring the views from my table, I was delightfully invited behind the scenes for a peek behind the curtain at Per Se. The intensity was real!

https://preview.redd.it/4ptzf6rl4akf1.jpg?width=5777&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=723fb6259252d83d8ba4bc4ac9b19094036aa849

Upon leaving the wine cellar, I found my bag waiting for me in the Salon, accompanied by a lovely gift bag and a clean, personalized printed copy of the menu.

**Some Final Thoughts...**

*first, a kind thank you for reading all this way if you have.*

So, 12 courses and a $480 check later… three Michelin stars in the heart of NYC. *This* was it, right? All week, I braced myself for a sentimental night, imagining a quiet evening of reflection. Instead, Chef Keller’s team shattered any sense of stillness; I was giddy, leaning forward, eagerly anticipating the next surprise.

But I think perfection on a plate is fleeting. A day later, as I reach for the details of flavors already dulled by time, what stays with me is the urge I had, course after course after course, to turn to someone and say, *holy shit, taste this!* Yesterday night has taught me that food at its peak, no matter the care, imagination, or creativity poured into it, is ultimately about connection.

“Per Se is outdated.” “Per Se is past their prime.” “Per Se remains a classic in modern fine dining.” “Was Per Se truly world-class 3-Michelin star cuisine?” Maybe. Probably. Honestly, I don’t know, and I don’t think I care to find out. Dinner at Per Se was a special evening. *That’s all that matters.*

Was it the best meal of my life? Hand on the Bible, yes. But what lingered as I stepped out into Columbus Circle wasn’t the lobster sauce, the bread, or the drinks—it was the rare gift of feeling fully present, savoring each bite, and hoping, one day, to come back not just for the food, but to watch someone else’s eyes widen the way mine did.

Goodbye, New York, and thank you, Per Se!

1mvyxwh,https://www.reddit.com/r/OdysseyBookClub/comments/1mvyxwh/self_heal_by_design_by_barbara_oneill_summary/,"“”Self Heal by Design“” by Barbara O’Neill – Summary, Quotes, and Lessons for Anyone Disillusioned by Modern Medicine","What if *everything* we’ve been taught about illness is just managing symptoms – not actually healing? That’s the central challenge Barbara O’Neill throws at you in *Self Heal by Design*, a book that’s quietly gone viral in natural wellness communities. O’Neill isn’t your average TikTok wellness coach either - she’s a trained psychiatric nurse and naturopath, bridging science and holistic wisdom in a way that feels both grounded and revolutionary.

This isn’t some light green juice manifesto. It’s a deep, occasionally controversial exploration of how your body is actually *designed* to heal itself – if you stop sabotaging it. Think: gut bacteria, pH balance, fungus, cell oxygenation, and ancient knowledge about terrain theory (yup, the anti-germ-theory crowd). O’Neill doesn’t just question big pharma—she gives you the blueprint for becoming your own healer.

## **Book Club Rating: 9/10**  
This book cracked open some *wild* new perspectives for me. Not for the faint of heart or the skeptics, but if you’re ready to take radical responsibility for your health… buckle up.

## **Key Takeaways:**

* Your gut is your inner ecosystem. 90% of your immune function comes from gut health, and your villi = plant roots. Damaged gut = weak plant = chronic illness.
* Microorganisms are not your enemies. They morph based on your body’s internal state - from healing helpers to destroyers when you’re imbalanced. This is “pleomorphism,” and it turns germ theory on its head.
* Fungus loves sugar. Like, LOVES it. Candida and other fungi can multiply like crazy when your diet is full of refined carbs and moldy grains.
* Cancer might not be what you think. O'Neill introduces Simoncini’s theory that many cancers are actually fungal overgrowths. Treatments like baking soda (alkalizing) could be more effective than chemo in some cases. Controversial? 100%. Worth reading? Absolutely.
* Healing starts with *terrain*, not genetics. Nutrition, minerals, oxygen, emotions – they all shift gene expression. Only 2% of diseases are truly genetic.
* Balance is key: alkaline-forming foods, oxygen-rich environments, clean water, restful sleep, movement, and joy – they *literally* change your internal chemistry.
* Detox your life. Pesticides, heavy metals, fake hormones, mold – they create the perfect storm for disease.
* The liver is your CEO of detox. You need to support it like your life depends on it (because it kind of does).

## **Favorite Quotes:**

* “Microorganisms don’t cause disease. They show up because disease is already there.”
* “The body is designed to heal – just stop interrupting it.”
* “Your internal environment determines which organisms survive, thrive, or die.”

## **Personal Insight:**  
This book hit me like a green juice shot to the brain. I used to think bloating, fatigue, and brain fog were normal. Nope – they were just my gut screaming for help. O’Neill’s take on fungal overgrowth made me completely reevaluate my relationship with food. And sugar. Oof.

If you're tired of feeling like a passive patient and want to understand *why* your body behaves the way it does – you need to read this book.

(Screenshots Inside!),"Okay, wait a minute… did you guys know there are *actual* apps out there handing out real money just for testing out new features? Like, I thought these “get paid to test apps” things were a scam, but I was DEAD WRONG. I’m still reeling from the fact that my screenshots don’t lie. The cash hit my PayPal and just—boom. But here’s the wildest part: some of the highest paying, most *legit* ones are kinda under the radar. 

You seriously have to see this for yourself: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp** (how have I not heard of this sooner???)

If you’re as confused (and hyped) as me, check out these SEVEN apps that will blow your mind – real users, real payments, real fun. I had zero expectations and ended up making coffee money in a *lunch break.*

- **PlayTestCloud**  
Literal game-changer. They invite you to test new game features, record your experience, and PAY YOU for it. Some games even let you keep playing new builds after the test ends.  
So. Much. Fun.

- **UserTesting**  
Classic for a reason. The requests are all over the place—websites, app prototypes, even random features that aren’t released yet. Tests are quick ($10 for <20 min?) and super satisfying to do on the couch after work.

- **BetaFamily**  
I’m calling it: the testing marketplace EVERYONE’s going to be talking about in 2025. Various apps, instant feedback, fast payments. Some days, it’s like: “Do I even need a full-time job at this point?”

By the way, don’t sleep on this one: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**.

- **Testbirds**  
Here’s where you get weird requests. They might email you, asking to find bugs in AI tools or comment on design features. Some feature tests are so secret you can’t even screenshot.  
Pays thru PayPal/SEPA.

- **BetaTesting** *(not to be confused with BetaFamily!)*  
Nice selection of active tests every week – especially for apps about finance, productivity, and shopping.  
Fees average $10-$25, depending on how deep they want you to go.  
I was honestly SHOCKED at how easy some of these tests are.

- **uTest**  
Connect with remote testing gigs for enormous companies (won’t name names, but we’re all using their tech right now…). Loads of new feature testing, security bonuses, and “Bug Bounty” events if you like finding glitches.

- **GoodNovel TestApp**  
ATTN: Book lovers, writers, beta readers. This one is fresh off the press in 2025 and partners with indie publishers testing interactive fiction features. Rewards *stack up* quickly with short tests, sometimes you even get cool swag in addition to cash.  
I’d honestly only heard about it here: **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
And… let’s just say, I went back four times already.

If you’re still skeptical, HERE (for the last time): **https://goodnovel.org/testapp**  
I wasn’t expecting to be this hyped, but here I am. If you’ve discovered another banger that isn’t on this list, PLEASE drop it below because my jaw cannot drop any further today.

I am looking for a friend for hanging out and going places—different cafés, restaurants, beaches, parks, or just anywhere or any activities. I can always add another hobby or just talk about nothing in a coffee shop somewhere. If I can find that kind of friend here, that's awesome; if not, at least I tried.

If you're looking for something more, please don't; you'll probably be disappointed, and I'm gonna be disappointed, so we're both going to be disappointed 😆.

Also preferably you're around Taguig like BGC, as I live near Vista Mall Taguig.

Don't get me wrong... I have close friends, and some of them I found here on Reddit. But...I just need more, as I am starting to get used to being alone again, and I don't want that. 😆 

About me:
* I work the night shift Monday to Friday. (We can hang out on Saturday or Sunday.)
* Hobbies: Riding motorcycle, watching anime, and reading manga, manhua, and light novels 
* I workout 3-4x a week but still chubby-ish because cupcakes are evil. 😆

I can't remember anything about me anymore. 😆

1mvytqf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreditCards/comments/1mvytqf/to_keep_cancel_or_downgrade_my_amex_gold_card/,"To keep, cancel, or downgrade my AMEX Gold card","I'm conflicted. I currently hold with AMEX the Gold, Platinum, Aspire, Surpass, and Delta Gold (mainly for work related trips when I need a checked bag because my status lies with AA). 90% or more of my MR point redemptions are with Hilton. I have more than enough MR points to last me for at least 2-3 years, same goes for Hilton Honors points, UR points and AA miles pretty much. Well, my annual fee posted on my gold and I've had it for only a year at this point. I signed up for it for the 100k bonus last year and continued using it throughout the year. I know that with my Aspire and Surpass my dining and groceries are well covered and that the additional MR earned and transferred to Hilton when AMEX has transfer bonuses still probably don't outweigh the annual fee.

As for the credits, really the only credit that is 100% used without thought is the Resy credit. All the others I have to force myself to change something. UberEats here and there or GrubHub just never was a part of my day to day until that card made it that way. And Dunkin, eh. I add the $7 to my account monthly but only grab that when it's more convenient that McDonalds coffee or something. I'm not regularly going out of my way to get a Dunkin coffee when McDonalds is the easiest option for me.

So, I'm at this impasse with myself on if I should close it, downgrade it, or ride it out another year. Closing it seems most logical as I can always reopen it again should I decide closing it was a poor decision. Yet, I've read that people do this ""downgrade / upgrade"" game. If I downgrade to green, in all reality what is the likelihood I would see an upgrade offer back to the gold for something reasonable? Say 40k+ MR for the upgrade? I'd happily pay the annual fee again for an upgrade bonus such as that and the just re-address after another year goes by.

Again, I have plenty of points in the bank and I know they only get devalued as time goes on, but I much prefer having travel points bankrolled that earning on cash back cards. I know the logic there may be a bit illogical, but I prefer it that way at this point in my life.

I guess as another piece, I understand the platinum fee is increasing here very soon as well. I guess shaving this fee off might make it more palatable when I see what the Platinum is really going up to.

Anyways, any input is appreciated, especially if you've been in this first-world conundrum as well.",1,1755743227.0,CreditCards,4,0.67,False

Mere months ago, u/RaptureSnatch posted a video that captured the hearts and minds of Laqueristas everywhere. Overnight, this sub transformed into a den of ingenuity. Laqueristas searched their cupboards, garages, and online retailers high and low for devices that spin, stir, and crank. Lego was borrowed, technology of yore was resurrected, junk drawers were ransacked, husbands were recruited, power tools were used irresponsibly, and [Amazon frequently bought together sections were altered](https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditLaqueristas/comments/1mitehv/yall_who_did_this/). To the pioneers and inventors of various glass bead techniques, I salute you. This level of creativity must not be allowed to disappear into the forgotten corners of the internet.  
  
Women, thems, and men of STEM, I present to you: ***The Glass Bead Bonanza***. I leave this as a reference post for those on a quest for their perfect glass bead apparatus, and for the digital archeologists and sociologists of the future who wish to study to the magnet madness.

This is not a complete archive, but my goal was to include one post per technique (ideally, the pioneer of each method or the post that got the most traction). Whether you, your partner, or your children have a degree in mechanical engineering, are a Lego enthusiast, a 3D printing wizard, or a scavenging DIYer, there is a glass bead technique in here for you! Most require a horseshoe magnet, but there's a section near the end for those who need to DIY without a horseshoe magnet. If a post title doesn't explicitly state what tools were used, I added it in parentheses for easier navigation.

When trying any of these techniques remember: safety first, safety second, coolness third. May all your glass bead manis be dazzling!

1mvyqx3,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1mvyqx3/i_found_a_ticket_to_the_amusement_park_that/,I found a ticket to the amusement park that burned down when I was a kid. I went tonight. I'm not the only visitor.,"The thing in the mirror wasn't me anymore. It wore my face, my clothes… but it was smiling a smile that was all teeth, and its eyes… its eyes were pits. It stood perfectly still in the rippling glass of the funhouse mirror, while I was shaking, my knuckles white where I gripped the guide rail. It raised a hand, my hand, and waved slowly, a gesture of final, horrible welcome. The smile widened, stretching the skin of my own face into an impossible shape. It knew I was trapped. And it was so, so happy about it.

It started, as these things so often do, with a piece of paper that should not have existed. Just a few hours ago, I was collapsing onto my couch when I emptied my bag onto the coffee table—keys, wallet, phone, loose change… and a ticket. It was made of thick, creamy cardstock, the kind they don't use anymore. The colors were garish circus red and gold, faded with age. In ornate, looping letters, it read: ""Wonderland Park."" And beneath that, a single, chilling sentence: ""Your journey begins tonight.""

Wonderland Park. The name was a ghost on my tongue. It had been a local legend, a sprawling kingdom of light and noise that had burned to the ground twenty years ago. A tragedy that scarred the town's memory. I was there that night, a small child clutching my father’s hand, pulled away from the fireworks just moments before the first screams echoed through the summer air. I have a fractured memory of it—the smell of cotton candy suddenly choked by something acrid, the brilliant orange of the fireworks being replaced by a hungry, terrifying orange of a different kind.

The ticket shouldn't have been in my bag. But holding it, I felt a pull. A compulsion. Before I knew it, my keys were back in my hand, and I was driving toward the skeletal ruins on the edge of town.

The old highway was a graveyard of cracked asphalt. I parked by the main entrance, its wrought-iron gates sagging and choked with rust. A faded sign still hung crookedly: ""Where Dreams Come Alive!"" And then, with a groan of tortured metal, the gates began to swing inward. On their own.

I stepped through. The sight before me was impossible. It wasn't a ruin. Wonderland Park was alive. Thousands of lights blazed against the night sky. The air was thick with the sweetness of popcorn, undercut by the sharp, metallic tang of ozone from the rides. A cheerful calliope tune spilled from unseen speakers, a melody of pure joy that felt profoundly wrong, warped, as if played from a water-damaged tape loop.

I walked down the main midway. The park was pristine but… off. The paint on the game stalls was fresh, but I could see the rotted wood beneath it. The brass poles on the carousel gleamed, but their reflection was distorted. It was a perfect, beautiful lie painted over a corpse. This wasn't a haunting. This was a resurrection. And I was the only living soul in it.

Drawn by the hypnotic, off-key music, I found myself standing before the grand carousel. It was turning slowly, full of people. Families, children laughing, couples holding hands. A wave of relief washed over me. It was just a private event. I was an idiot.

But the relief was short-lived. I started to notice the repetition. A woman in a yellow sundress dropped her popcorn, bent to pick it up, stood, and then dropped it again in the exact same way. A little boy with a red balloon waved enthusiastically to empty space, his arm moving like a clockwork mechanism. They were all trapped in tiny, silent loops of action. Echoes.

I stepped closer, needing to see their faces. I stood by the railing as the woman in the yellow dress came around. Her skin had a waxy, doll-like sheen. As she passed, her head turned slightly, and I saw her eyes. They were clouded, milky-white, the eyes of a fish dead for a week. The laughing child came next. His smile was fixed, his lips pulled back from greyish gums. His eyes were the same.

They weren't recordings. They were puppets. Perfectly preserved corpses, animated by some unseen force, forever riding a carousel to nowhere. As this realization crashed down on me, the woman in the yellow sundress broke her loop. Her head swiveled with a series of quiet clicks, her neck twisting a full one hundred and eighty degrees. And her dead, milky eyes fixed directly on mine.

I ran. I didn't scream. The sound was trapped in my lungs. My panicked flight led me to the gaping, leering mouth of the funhouse, ""The Crooked Smile."" I stumbled inside, into a hall of mirrors. I expected distorted reflections, but one by one, the mirrors stopped distorting. They became clear windows.

The mirror to my left showed a flash of fire raining down on a screaming crowd. The mirror to my right showed a child—me—my face streaked with tears and soot. Every mirror was playing a scene from that night, twenty years ago. Not as a memory, but as a live feed. The park wasn't just replaying its own death; it was using my trauma as part of the exhibit. It was inside my head.

Then I came to the final mirror. It showed my reflection perfectly. I stood there, catching my breath. It's just a trick. And that's when the reflection changed. It stood up a little straighter. The terror on its face slowly melted away, replaced by an unnerving calm. And then, it smiled. A predator's smile, all teeth and no warmth. It was the smile of the thing that was truly in charge here. Staring at my own face, worn by something utterly alien, it raised a hand and gave me that slow, terrible wave.

I recoiled and scrambled out the back of the funhouse. I was in a quieter part of the park, dominated by the giant Ferris wheel, ""The Star Gazer."" Each car was empty, swaying gently. It seemed safe. An escape. I ran to the nearest car, fumbled with the latch, and fell inside, pulling it shut.

The door locked with a heavy, final thud. The entire structure shuddered and began to turn, lifting me slowly into the air. I was trapped. That's when a voice crackled from a small speaker in the corner of the car. It was smooth, like a seasoned radio host, dripping with a sinister, theatrical charm.

""A warm Wonderland welcome to our guest of honor,"" the voice purred. ""It has been so very long since we've had a visitor with such a strong connection.""

""What do you want?"" I yelled.

""Want?"" The voice chuckled. ""A carnival is a simple creature. It wants an audience. It wants energy. This place… it runs on memories. On echoes. But echoes fade. They need a… battery. A new source. Someone with a foot in both worlds. The world of the living, and the world of that night.""

My car reached the apex of the wheel and stopped, leaving me suspended high above the ground.

""You see,"" the Ringmaster continued, ""your ticket was a key, forged from your own unresolved past. It unlocked our door. Now, we offer you a choice. A permanent place here. You can live forever in your happiest memory, a perfect, endless loop. Join the show willingly.""

""And if I don't?"" I whispered.

The voice lost its charming edge. A cold, ancient malice bled through. ""Then the show will take you anyway. But you won't be a star. You'll just be another prop.""

Below me, a horrifying symphony began. Every ride ground to a halt. The calliope music died. In perfect unison, every single corpse—on the carousel, in the game stalls, wandering the midway—stopped. They all turned their heads upward. A hundred pairs of dead, clouded eyes stared directly at me.

""Your first ticket was for admission,"" the Ringmaster's voice said, its tone now flat and final. ""But every patron needs a ticket to leave. It's the rule.""

Something flickered in the air above the seat opposite me. A single, pristine ticket materialized and fluttered down onto the vinyl cushion. It was identical to the first one, but the words were different. It didn't promise a journey. It demanded a price. It read: ""One Soul.""

I’m still here, in this car, high above the silent, watching dead. The wind is howling. The ticket lies on the seat, a stark white rectangle in the gloom. A contract. A damnation. My hand is shaking, but I'm reaching for it.

What would you do? Take the ticket and escape, leaving a piece of your soul behind to feed this place? Or refuse, and become one of them? I need to know what you think I should do.

I've recorded everything on my phone, documenting what's happening here at what I'm calling **The Umbral Archive**. If you want to hear the full, terrifying story in my own words, you can listen to the audio I'm uploading right now. Maybe it will prove I'm not crazy.

We ask questions about each other, seem to have overlapping interests. Nothing particularly deep or amazing, but a good conversation.

Recently I was talking to this girl at a bar, we had a lot in common; places travelled to, languages, coffee etc. Couple of times in the conversation I noticed her playing with her hair, or leaning to me as if she was trying to figure out what to ask next and then proceeding to ask more questions about me. She also asked what my favorite cafe is and we traded socials and agreed I will take her there.

I took all these as signs of interest from her, but after texting her later to follow up on coffee, I've just received no reply at all. Now I'm just confused. I'm specially confused when this happens on dates, where we both seem to be having a good time, but it doesn't materialize into something more.

I can't help but feel I'm misreading women's interest in me and I could really use some answers.

What are good verbal and non-verbal signs a woman is interested in a guy she's talking to, especially on a date?

How can I tell the difference between a woman who's interested romantically and one who's just having a good time socializing with me?

I keep dragging my brain back to the moment, thinking once more how the air felt before the words fell and shattered everything. We’re the same blood, yet the picture shattered. I (25F) assumed the distance between us was just another flavor of family, maybe extra tart, but I told myself it was affection in disguise. I convinced myself the unmoving eyes and tight silence under the same roof meant love was lurking, waiting for the right words. I was wrong.



The fight started over something silly at the kitchen table and ballooned faster than I could breathe. “You ruined my life,” she barked. “I never even wanted kids. You were a mistake I couldn’t undo.” I dropped my fork. Laughed a laugh that wasn’t my laugh. Surely, a mother couldn’t torch her child to cinders right before dessert. But she lit the flame a second time. “I did it to keep my mother’s jaw shut,” she said, “and now I wake up smelling the life I spit out to get this rotten version.”



I woke up and replay, replay that moment the way I used to rehearse love on stormy days. A) coffee cup and scented talk on the couch. B) birthday candles blown out in a laugh that tasted of steak and mint and hope. C) pick-me-up “I love you, sweetest mistake.” I flinch and stumble over the ruins because B never existed. There was never any soundtrack under the pause between phrases.



Even now I replay it, frame- by- frame, trying to find one word that sounds any kinder, one gesture that wasn’t scored dark with accusation. I keep telling myself these wounds are accidental, that I misinterpreted. But the doubt glows, the way chips of mirror can glow. There is a chrome glint in every corner of my throat that says the truth is sharper than I’ve let myself think. What if the heart I trusted was the very one guarding a silent ledger of disappointments? What if the lullabies were only tools to quiet the one who never quite wanted to be soothed?



**I don’t need any advice. I don’t want to have another fight with her again. I just… needed to get this out somewhere because it feels like it is killing me inside.**

1mvymdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhdwomen/comments/1mvymdz/adhd_or_burnout_stress/,ADHD or burnout/ stress?,"I am writing this post because this has been in my mind for a long time and I just wanted to get some sense of that. I am not asking for diagnose (which I know only doctor can give) but just little help from people who actually have ADHD. I just wanted to get your opinion on this. I am well aware that you are not proffesionals and ADHD itself seems to have many nuances :)

I have trouble getting tasks done. Academic tasks are the ones that are my focus in this post because they are the most important ones. I have to write and read plenty which is often hard. I sit down and then I read for a little while and then my brain says that oh it is perfect time for little break. Only that this so called little break then becames 2 hours. Getting on the track is hard.So usually when i have task in hand, it gets its main parts on the same day that i have to turn it in. So procrastination. I often do things last minute, because that is where panic sets in. 
Every time I have to do something i feel like i have to be very careful because every little ""disharmony"" can set me off and make me lose my motivation. I may go all the way to library and still just sit there and do nothing. When i do get started then it doesn't last very long. But then again I can too, but just not always... sometimes I can focus and very well, but i don't know, it depends on atmopshere etc. I have discovered that coffee somewhat helps. 
I can make grand plans in my head, time table or whatever but i always go over time. I don't get even half of the things done.
For example I have some writing task and i planned to end it today but like always just another day went by where in the end i didn't really do anything (even when i have feeling that i did). In reality i maybe did it for ca 3 hours. But it feels like i had done it whole day. Now i am too anxious to go to sleep. I want to do my task, but i am stuck. I have been stuck for four days now. This task is important. I have to do it. I don't have time anymore, but i just can't. And this kind of thing happens a lot. 
Recently i have been exposed to information about adhd. I found that i related to it in many points. At the same time i am aware that it doesn't have to adhd, it can be just ""normal"" thing that has caused some similar symtoms because I can't say I related to all of them.  Maybe it is stress, maybe the so called perfectionist paralysis or burnout. Because to be fair it has only began to disturb me at university. In high school.. yes i did my task last minute too, but it wasn't half as bad. And before that too i haven't had any trouble. 
Now I am even more stressed, tasks undone. And sometimes it gets too much that I just don't care anymore... for little while and then i panic again lol. 
One thing i can say for certain is that it is not lasyness, because this whole process is not enjoyble at all. It makes me anxious and I am exhausted. I always need something to motivate me, something to pressure me. At the same time when I have too much pressure then it is difficult too. 

I just wanted to know If this experience I just described can be considered to be something like ADHD or does it sound like ""normal"" but unfortunate experience that is caused by stress or maybe the perfectionist streak in me? What has your experience been like? Because when I have talked about how I procrastinate to other fellow students then they have replayed that oh everyone does that.

Ever feel like your brain's in a perpetual game of ping-pong... and you're the ball? 🏓 One minute you're all in on that work project, the next you're googling ""why do cats knead?"" (Hey, no judgment here!)

**Stressed & Scattered?** 🧠 We've all been there. But before you reach for your third cup of coffee or start fantasizing about an impromptu vacation, let's try a little something called *The 2-Minute Reset.* 🌬️

Yup, just two minutes! It’s like magic, but with science... and less capes. 🦸‍♂️

So, what's the deal?

**Why breathe?**  

- **Grounds you faster than an unexpected dog lick on the face.** Breathing is not just for staying alive (shocking, I know 😄). It actually signals your body that everything’s cool and you’re not living in a perpetual state of ""Ahhhhhhh!""

- **Focus like a Zen master:** When you're scattered, your focus is more like a disco ball—fun but not very helpful for getting things done.

- **Science has your back:** Studies have shown that deep breathing can lower cortisol levels, which means less stress and more *you time.* 🎉

**Ready to try it? Here's the lowdown:**

1. **Find your spot.** Sit comfortably (or stand, if you're feeling rebellious). Close your eyes if you want.

2. **Inhale deeply through your nose for 4 counts.** Feel your belly expand like you've just seen a buffet. 🍕

3. **Hold that breath for 4 counts.** No passing out, promise. Just feel the tension say ""buh-bye!""

4. **Exhale slowly through your mouth for 6 counts.** Make it dramatic—like you're cooling down hot soup or letting out a satisfied ""ahhh"" after a long day.

5. **Repeat for 2 minutes.** Or longer if you accidentally drift off. 💤

**Why it works:** Engaging your parasympathetic nervous system calms you down faster than you can say ""Netflix and chill.""

Give it a shot the next time your to-do list looks like it's plotting against you. Who knew saving your sanity could be so... breezy?

What's been your go-to for instant calm? Or maybe you've just stumbled upon this breathing magic. Share your experiences below or just give this a whirl on a stressful day and see if it becomes your new secret weapon. 🛡️

Let's meander through a bookstore,"Calling fellow introverts. People who enjoy company and companionship, but are drained after new social interactions. Let's skip the small talk, skip everything, and just sit there enjoying each other's company. We’ll pick out a book for each other, hopefully something we wouldn’t have chosen on our own. 

We'll chat a little bit here on Reddit to get a feel for each other, and when we're ready we can trade photos. The next step will be a short video call to verify (safety first!). If we decide to go on the date, we’ll map out where we will go so we both know what to expect. 

We’ll start at a bookstore, taking our time as we peruse the spines lining the shelves. They all seem to be vying for our attention, don’t they? We’ll read author bios and front covers, waiting for just the right selection. After we’ve made our choices, we head out for a short walk and a coffee, and make our way to the park where we can talk over a bottle of wine m. At the end we’ll part ways, hopefully having planned our second date. 

Before you respond, here are some things about me:

* I'm 5'7"", shaved head, piercings, many tattoos, dad bod. 
* I'm quiet, which is why this idea appeals to me.
* My interests include chess, hiking, music, art, working out, cooking and just generally enjoying food, video games, anime, and volunteering.
* I'm non-monogamous with a lovely nesting partner, and they are aware when I date other people. I'm not seeking a long term, committed romance out of this. Just a fun evening, and I'm open to something casual and ongoing if we get along. 
* My age range is 25-40, with a bit of flexibility if you really think we'll get along.

If this appeals at all to you, or you have ideas of your own, please get in touch and tell me a bit about yourself! Most importantly, tell me whether you are a bookworm or book dragon.

As the title says, I was shocked by how easy I was able to waive my credit card fee. Long post ahead so if tamad magread ito lang naman pinagawa sakin: download BDO pay app and sign up within 3 days. Pero sana basahin nyo kasi may tanong ako sa baba hahhaha

So, for context, I have owned a BDO cc for 3 yrs now. Every time na magrereflect sa eSOA ko ung ANNUAL MEMBERSHIP FEE nagdre dread na ko kasi naiimagine ko na kagad ung hirap at tagal sa phone na dadaanan ko. Kasi antagal minsan bago makapag get in touch sa CSR. Also, usually kasi nagooffer sila ng 2 options para mawaive ung fee thru either 
1) spending PHP XX,XXX amount over 30-60 days (para sakin is napakahirap kasi di naman ako gastador na tao so iniisip ko na kagad na anghirap kasi I'd have to ask my fam or friends na gamitin ung cc ko to pay for their shits pero babayaran padin nila sakin which is painstakingly difficult in a lot of ways)
or 2) registering your card na automatic billing of your choosing and ako ung PLDT bill nmin sa bahay na 1957 (ayoko tong option na to kasi ayoko na madagdagan ung ambag ko sa household bills namin HHAHAHA kasi sapat lng sakin ung kinikita ko para magambag para sa car na hinuhulugan naming 3 na magkakapatid para sa parents tska bunso naman ako 😌)

So ito na nga this July nareceive ko ung email na ung annual membership fee ko is nareflect na sa eSOA. Sobrang dami ko pa namang errands like from work and personal shits, so sa isip isip ko, i suck up ko na lang ung bayad sa memb fee kasi depressed na ko kakaisip sa dami ng gagawin ko. Pero 1 night, while walking and having my coffee, bigla kong naisipan na why not itry ko lng ipawaive, kasi sobrang nasasayangan ako sa 1,800. Sa isip ko nga jinustify ko pa na ""i gaslight"" nlng sarili ko na monthly naman ung bayad nun, which is 1,800/12 mos = 150. So sabi ko 150 per month? Not bad. Pero putek di maalis alis tlga sa isip ko kasi 1,800 ung nakikita ko eh which is fxking maha na for me as a frugal personl! HAHHAHAHA. Nag sasave up kasi ako for Hexagon card eh. So ayun sabi ko try lang naman wala namang mawawala kasi kung sakali man na naachieve ko ung 30-60k na gastos edi okay, tapos kung hndi naman naachieve edi bayad na lang. So sabi ko ""try lang"". So ayun I built up the courage na and sobrang motivated ko kasi din gumawa ng mga bagay bagay para naman mabawasan na so I called BDO using my kuya's phone na unli call sa telephones (this sucks by the way, na di pwede matawagan si BDO thru cellphone kasi wala silang not landline contact, kapag kasi personal phone ko gnagamit ko I tried one time putcha nagaabang plang ako kasi naka on hold ubos na kagad load ko) then ayun I was freaking shocked kasi like 5 mins lang may nakausap na kong agent. As in shocked ako kasi usually napakatagal maghold. Baka kasi gabi na din ako tumawag, so sa isip isip ko, next time lagi na kong ganung oras tatawag. Then ayun sinabi ko sa CSR na gsto ko magpawaive. Tinanong nya ko kung nagdownload na ba ko ng BDO online and BDO pay app and sabi ko ung BDO online lang. Lo and behold, sabi nya in order for my fee to be waived, ang kailangan ko lang gawin is mag download ng BDO pay app then sign up. Upon hearing that, sabi ko ""putek himala ah, buti na lang d pa ko nakakapagdownload ng lintek na app na yon HAHAHHA"". Pero sa isip isip ko din, msyado namang too good to be true, so I naisip kong iask kung merong ""twist"" or something na hidden charges so I asked and sabi naman niya wala naman daw. Pero ayun I was hoping na wala tlga pero baka may alam kayong parang ""hidden"" shits dito sa gantong ganap, so pls comment if u have. Ayun lang sobrang natuwa lang ako na bihira ko magpost pero sabi ko ipost ko na dito hahhaha.

would I recommend doing this? absolutely not 😭 habaan niyo review niyo! dinaan lang talaga ako ng cobra, iced coffee, dasal, super daming snacks and masinsinang review. for the 3 weeks that I reviewed, I ghosted everyone. even the guy I liked. even most of my friends. hindi ako lumabas unless with family (actually ang lakas ng loob kong maki-game night pa sa kanila (monopoly pa yun) atska mag-ML, like ang ratio is 30 mins review:1 hr ranked game LOL) but I made sure to READ AND READ AND ANSWER.

I also listened to the lectures on 2x speed since my brain accepts more information talaga pag mabilis as compared to kapag mabagal (nakakatulog ako)

also made sure na ireview nang maigi kung san ako mahina (for me it was micro) so i spent more time there! don’t doubt yourself. sabi nga ng mga kaibigan ko, ilang taon mong pinag-handaan yan. hindi lang 3 weeks, but almost 5 YEARS.

So far aside from feet pain from standing almost 8 hours straight its genuinely been so fun. of course it has its stressful moments but generally its really nice.

Yet I still find myself having the worst anxiety I've ever had. Aside from occasional health scares, I haven't really even had anxiety before, and now feel like Im constantly gonna throw up and also start thinking the worst even if it doesn't make a lick of logical sense.

The only time its not like this is when I'm at work and about an hour or two when I get home, than for the rest of the night and the following morning, all until driving there, I feel horribly nervous and unsure where those terms barely cut it.

TLDR of concerns:  
\- burning myself  
\- miscalculating change (either giving too much or too little) and somehow going to prison for it  
\- working 8hrs a day every week for mid-tier pay for the rest of my life  
\- this anxiety not being cope-able

My concerns mostly consist of burning myself (Id say the water is hot enough to give 2nd degree burns when right out of the tap if you take too long in reaction time, not to mention if I somehow get like.. drenched in a hot coffee? I've heard stories of angry customers literally throwing their drinks at the baristas. like idk what i'd do since id have to get my clothes off fast but im like literally at work-),

miscalculating someones' change by even just a few cents and that somehow being as bad as fraud or a felony or something,

this being the rest of my life (In the sense that this is my first work week and its set to be 56hrs, its not terribly great money and I also feel like I have little personal time and like yk a day off would be nice, im worried this is how my schedule will be set forever?)

and obviously the anxiety. Im getting anxiety that this anxiety will never stop or have any solutions.

Theres likely more if i keep thinking but I'd rather not. All of these things have very logical and factual reasons as to why these feelings/thoughts are ridiculous yet I just.. cant. The only (stupid) solutions i've found online are 'watch a movie', 'name the things you can see', 'journal' and all that. like hello im still nauseous for no reason even when not thinking about it actively.",2,1755741991.0,Anxietyhelp,2,1.0,False

It’s not about pretending you have the thing. 

It’s about treating what you do have NOW like it’s already enough.

Because if you really believed your dream life was on its way, or already unfolding, or already here!! you would be obsessed with the present. You would be in love with life right now! You would be happy! kind! excited! full of love!!!!!

But no one wants to do this.
Because it’s simple!!! but not easy.
It means slowing down. Feeling. Being grateful. 

it doesn’t mean pretend your soulmate is next to you.

it doesn’t mean act like you’re rich when you’re broke.

it means:
live like what you have now is everything you ever wanted. wow! you are living a dream!!!

so try this:

look at your life, the bed you sleep in, the sky, the coffee, the quiet.

and decide that this is it. this is the life you dreamed of.

romanticise the tiniest things!!!!
 
and let that energy spill into your body like sunlight.

be thankful! be kind! share love! 

this is the cheat code to manifesting! 

that’s what makes you magnetic.

this is how you get everything you want!!!!

In my recovery journey I was bored and decided to have AI help me write my story in a haha kind of way.  Hope I don't offend anyone, I'm just trying to  laugh a little while recovering from surgery 1. 

The Fart That Tried to Kill Me

It started as an ordinary morning. Birds were chirping, coffee was brewing, and I was just trying to get my pants on without falling over. That’s when I felt it — a small, polite bubble of air in my gut.

“Ah,” I thought. “I’ll just let that one out before work.”

Big mistake.

The moment it escaped, it wasn’t the dainty puff I expected — it was The Fart of Doom. The instant it left, my body betrayed me, doubling me over like I’d just been drop-kicked by an invisible ninja.

Fast-forward twenty-four hours, and I’m in the ER telling the doctor, “So… this all started with a fart.” Then, like some medical plot twist, I’m being transferred for emergency surgery. Turns out my colon was staging a full-blown revolt called diverticulitis.

Nine days in the hospital later, I’ve got a drain tube, surgery ahead, and a future sidekick — my very own poop bag. All because I underestimated one rogue toot.

So here’s the moral of the story: Never trust a fart. Some are harmless. Some are loud. And some… will change your life forever.",3,1755741645.0,Diverticulitis,0,0.8,False

Dated, broke up due to her befoming detached, she dated the ""he's just a friend guy"" that inevitably failed, she came back but couldnt admit to her feelings (her friends told me how she actually felt). She had dating apps and  talking to other ""guy friends"" but the supposed reson we didnt work the second time was ""I thought you were talking to another girl"" which was false but she took it as fact.

Heres where I probably messed up I didn't block I simply just ignored. First few days she was sending memories then that progressed into these guys have been hitting on me and people keep telling me I look good then there were a few lifes shit, works shit kind of thing.

I did see one of her friends kids passed away and she seemed upset so I said ""sorry to hear the news, hope your well"" got back a relatively long but basic message the usual ""im shocked, so upset and havent been eating kind of thing"" her posting frequency also went up mostly what people would called validation seeking post. 

Well after 3 weeks of me just moving on with my life and not giving her anything she sent a snap that seemed like a cry for help which to some it up was her saying if she was to follow through with the thoughts she was having no one would care, notice. No one wants to see her and no one gives a damn. Well I broke no contact as im not the person that will ignore that thing I simply said ""Hope your okay. If you need to chat reach out or would you like to go and get a coffee and talk about it?"". Received a ""😭"" as a response so I peft it at that.

As the evening progresses im out and since shes been sending me updates so is she drinking and whatever else. So i told her Id appreciate if she didnt contact me if she's going to send something like the above and ignore me wheb I check on her. Got the we are hust friends to which I said ""All the best not for me"", phone lit up like a christmas tree instantly with calls until I answered which ended the same ""friends"".

Following morning I deleted her and back in no contact for nearly a week. Think im more mad that she used self harm and proceeded to give me nothing after that which is what Im annoyed about. I mean yeah the friends thing is upsetting considering im the first guy thats made her feel loved and wanted which she said she doesnt feel she deserves or that she is to broken to be loved so doesnt belive me.

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

Some may use puns, some stereotypes, but I delve into etymology and lazy Google searches (well, I tried), and the names chosen might not even be correct. I don't know.

  
For instance, this is my study on my America's human name:

  
AMERICA (M)
Name: Eric Sebastian Pomeroy

Eric means ""eternal ruler"", which is totally something America would name himself (because the world is his home and in his mind, yes, he rules it). Plus, it's Old Norse, and a very obvious reference to Erik the Red. He would've chosen Charles (freedom, baby!), if Peru hadn't already chosen Carlos.
Sebastian means ""venerable, revered"", which is peak America because of course he thinks he's revered. It is also, according to him, ""kind of Spanish"" (without the accent, though, because apparently, ""I took the land not the grammar"") which is a reference to the whole ""taking land from Mexico (and technically also Spain)"" thing.
Pomeroy is French and basically a reminder that Louisiana exists. It means ""apple orchard"", which is clearly America remembering Johnny Appleseed. (Note: he took this alias in 1865. Johnny had been gone for only twenty years at the time. Nostalgia.)

  
And Canada:

CANADA (M)
Name: Alden Lyle Hinkley

Alden means “friend”. Canadians are known to be friendly and polite. It’s a name that originated from Old English, referencing the fact that the English were the dominating colonisers in Canada.
Lyle is a French name, only here because Québec exists and wouldn't accept erasure. It means “from the island”, which is pretty accurate given that the British did come from an island. Okay, two islands. It also has Scottish roots, and since it was the Scots who inspired place names like Nova Scotia and Mackenzie Bay, I see this as an absolute win.
Hinkley is another English surname (colony days), and it may mean “bear cub’s clearing”, which is a reference to the three types of bears in Canada (there weren’t options for moose and beavers) - grizzly bears, polar bears and black bears.
I would have added an Inuit name to the mix, but there are too many of them (First Nations, Inuit...) to find a dominating one, and Canada isn’t exactly known for its protection of native Americans.

  
And Costa Rica:

  
COSTA RICA (F)
Name: Serena Marisol Flores de la Vega
(Note: Costa Rica's two surnames are Flores and de la Vega. Not one surname Flores de la Vega. She loves correcting people who get it wrong every time.)

Serena means ""serene"", which is basically Costa Rica's entire existence (pura vida!). Plus, Spanish.
Marisol, derived from ""María de la Soledad"" (Spanish colonisation and spread of Christianity, probably), sounds like ""mar y sol"" (sea and sun), like Costa Rica's tropical-ish climate and, of course, the beaches.
Flores means ""flower"", referring to Costa Rica's huge array of flower species, and indirectly Costa Rica's whole ecosystem.
De la Vega means ""of the meadow"", but can also be taken to mean ""of the fertile plain"", which is fitting since Costa Rica's land is known for being fertile (otherwise, where did the coffee come from?).

I found I was all over the place. And there would be days that my boss would wonder if I actually did anything. When I was introduced to Vyvanse, I was literally the most concentrated I've ever been. I started on 10 g, and for the first two weeks it lasted about 6 hours. I moved up to twenties and was good for about 3 months. I went to the doctor and they prescribed me '40s, and it lasted for about 6 months before I would crash or lose focus after 5 hours. I moved from '40s to '50s, , which was actually a 30 and a 20 taken in periodic time frames. One at 7:00 a.m., One at 11:00 a.m.. that saw me good for about 7 months. Again, it started to wear off so I moved to 60. (Two 30's) in the morning. 
While that lasts about 9 hours. One day. I couldn't remember if I took it. To be safe I took just 30. Turns out my wife said I did take it in the morning, so that was 90. That actually nearly killed me.

Moral of the story is. Be very careful. But I don't know if this is sustainable. Because I am crashing hard. Now I do drink coffee, and I do occasionally have nicotine. The nicotine needs to go though, because I used to use 50 mg pouches. That combined with a Vyvanse 60 mg and 3 cups of coffee... Make you nauseous at least.

This helped me find purpose and changed how I see everything.

Flow state is where life actually happens. When you're completely absorbed in something you love, time disappears. Started paying attention to when I naturally enter flow and realized that's when I feel most alive and connected to something bigger.

The universe operates on patience, not urgency. Everything in nature grows slowly trees, relationships, wisdom. I was trying to force major life changes overnight and burning out. Learn to work with natural rhythms instead of against them.

Boredom is your brain's way of processing life. Used to panic whenever I felt unstimulated and would immediately grab my phone. Now I sit with boredom and let my mind wander. That's when the best ideas come when you're not forcing anything.

Your ikigai isn't always your job. Spent years thinking I had to monetize everything I enjoyed. Sometimes your purpose is being a good friend, creating art no one sees, or just bringing calm energy to chaotic situations. It's simply learning how to live in the present moment.

Small, consistent actions create meaning. Instead of looking for one big purpose, I started noticing tiny things that brought me joy like making coffee mindfully, really listening to people, taking care of plants. Purpose isn't always profound.

Community and connection are non-negotiable. The loneliness epidemic is real. Started prioritizing relationships over achievements and everything felt more meaningful. We're literally wired for connection. We are social animals after all.

Accepting impermanence reduces anxiety. Everything changes, including your problems and your current situation. This used to terrify me, now it's oddly comforting. Bad phases pass, but so do good ones - so you appreciate both more.

The book reads like a gentle conversation rather than a self-help manual. It reminded me that meaning isn't something you find ""out there"" it emerges from how you engage with whatever's in front of you.

Chapter 1

The grocery bags slipped from my numb fingers as I stepped through the front door, plastic containers of ice cream and frozen vegetables scattering across the hardwood floor. The house hit me like a furnace blast—a wall of suffocating heat that made my lungs seize. Something was wrong. Terribly wrong. Our home never felt like this, not even during Seattle's worst summer days. The custom air conditioning system Adam had insisted we install last year—six powerful units strategically placed throughout our three-story house—should have kept every room at a perfect seventy-two degrees. But now, the air hung thick and motionless, pressing against my skin like a wet blanket. Sweat immediately beaded on my forehead as I abandoned the scattered groceries and rushed toward the living room, my heart hammering against my ribs. ""Theo?"" I called out, my voice cracking with sudden panic. I found my eight-year-old son sprawled on the leather couch, his usually bright eyes glazed and unfocused. His cheeks blazed crimson, and his small chest rose and fell in rapid, shallow breaths that made my stomach clench with terror. ""Mommy,"" he whispered, his voice barely audible. ""I'm so hot. The air stopped working."" My hands shook as I pressed my palm against his burning forehead. His skin felt like fire, and his dark hair clung to his scalp in damp curls. This wasn't just discomfort—this was dangerous. ""Where's Daddy?"" I asked, trying to keep the rising hysteria from my voice as I grabbed a throw pillow to fan him. The movement stirred the stagnant air but provided no real relief. Theo pointed weakly toward the kitchen. ""He said the cold boxes went away. Said Aunt Jasmine needed them more."" The words hit me like a physical blow. I stared at my son's flushed face, certain I'd misunderstood. ""What cold boxes, sweetheart?"" ""The air things. In the walls."" His small hand gestured vaguely around the room. I spun around, my gaze flying to the wall where our main unit had been mounted just this morning. Empty brackets jutted from the wall like broken bones, and fresh holes in the drywall marked where screws had been hastily removed. The expensive copper refrigerant lines hung loose and capped, testament to a rushed removal job. My legs nearly gave out as the reality crashed over me. All six units. Gone. ""Adam!"" I screamed, my voice echoing through the sweltering house. ""ADAM!"" Heavy footsteps thundered down the stairs, and my husband appeared in the doorway, looking perfectly comfortable despite the oppressive heat. His sandy hair showed no signs of perspiration, and his polo shirt remained crisp and dry. He must have been in his home office—the only room with a window unit he'd installed ""for backup."" ""What's all the shouting about?"" he asked, his tone carrying that familiar note of irritation he'd developed whenever I interrupted his day. ""The air conditioning,"" I gasped, still fanning Theo frantically. ""Where are our units? Theo's burning up, and the house is like an oven!"" Adam's expression didn't change. If anything, his jaw tightened with annoyance. ""I told you yesterday I was helping Jasmine out. She needed them more than we do."" The casual way he said it—as if he'd mentioned picking up milk—made my vision blur with disbelief. ""You gave away our air conditioning? All of it? In this heat?"" ""Don't be so dramatic, Daniella."" He crossed his arms, his voice taking on that condescending tone that always made me feel small. ""It's just hot weather. People survived for thousands of years without air conditioning."" ""Look at your son!"" I shouted, my composure finally cracking. ""Look at him, Adam! He can barely breathe!"" For a moment, Adam's gaze flickered to Theo's overheated form, and I saw something that might have been concern cross his features. But it vanished as quickly as it appeared, replaced by defensive anger. ""Stop being hysterical,"" he snapped. ""Jasmine lost her husband six months ago. She's struggling to make ends meet, and those units were just sitting here most of the year anyway. She needed them more than we do."" ""We paid twelve thousand dollars for those units!"" My voice cracked with desperation. ""They're custom-designed for this house! And the temperature is supposed to hit one hundred and ten degrees today!"" ""Money isn't everything, Daniella."" His words dripped with self-righteousness. ""Family is what matters. Jasmine is family too."" The irony of his statement—delivered while his own son suffered from heat exhaustion—would have been laughable if it weren't so heartbreaking. ""Please,"" I begged, swallowing my pride. ""Just get one back. One unit. For Theo's room. He's going to get sick."" Adam's face hardened into a mask of cold indifference. ""Jasmine already has them installed. I'm not going to upset a grieving widow because you can't handle a little heat."" With that, he turned on his heel and strode toward the front door, leaving me kneeling beside our son in the suffocating heat, clutching a useless throw pillow as my only weapon against the merciless temperature that threatened to consume us both.
Chapter 2

Twenty minutes later, I sat in my car outside Jasmine's apartment complex, my hands gripping the steering wheel so tightly my knuckles had gone white. The engine idled as I stared at the modest two-story building, trying to convince myself that Adam was telling the truth—that those expensive units were really helping a grieving widow, not funding some scheme I couldn't yet imagine. The heat radiating through my windshield made my skin prickle with sweat, and I thought of Theo back home, still sprawled on that leather couch with his flushed cheeks and labored breathing. I'd left him with a bowl of ice water and every fan in the house pointed his direction, but it wasn't enough. Nothing would be enough until I got those units back. I was about to drive away when movement in the parking lot caught my eye. Jasmine emerged from the building's side entrance, her perfectly styled blonde hair catching the harsh sunlight. She wore a flowing sundress that looked expensive—too expensive for someone supposedly struggling financially—and her makeup remained flawless despite the oppressive heat. But it wasn't her appearance that made my blood run cold. It was what she was doing. Jasmine stood beside a white pickup truck, gesturing animatedly at one of our custom air conditioning units sitting in the truck bed. The distinctive brushed steel casing and digital display were unmistakable—I'd watched the installation crew mount that exact unit in our master bedroom just fourteen months ago. A middle-aged man in work clothes handed her a thick roll of cash, which she counted with practiced efficiency before tucking it into her purse. The casual way she conducted the transaction, the satisfied smile playing at her lips—this wasn't desperation. This was business. ""One is really enough for my little place,"" I heard her say as I rolled down my window, her voice carrying across the parking lot. ""These babies are top-of-the-line. You're getting a steal at fifteen hundred."" Fifteen hundred dollars. For a unit that had cost us four thousand. Rage flooded through me like molten steel. I threw the car door open and strode across the asphalt, my sandals slapping against the heated pavement. ""Jasmine!"" She spun around, her blue eyes widening with what looked like genuine surprise. The man with the truck glanced between us nervously, clearly sensing the tension crackling in the air. ""Daniella! What are you doing here?"" Her voice pitched higher, taking on that breathy quality she always used when caught off-guard. ""What am I doing here?"" I stopped just feet from her, close enough to see the guilt flickering behind her carefully applied mascara. ""I'm watching you sell my family's air conditioning units to strangers while my son is home suffering from heat exhaustion!"" The man with the truck took a step back. ""Look, lady, I don't want any trouble. She said these were hers to sell."" ""They're not,"" I said, my voice deadly quiet. ""Those units belong to my family. She has no right to sell them."" Jasmine's expression shifted, the fake sweetness melting away to reveal something harder underneath. ""Actually, they were given to me. By my brother-in-law. Freely given."" She emphasized the last two words like they were weapons. ""Given to help you, not to profit from!"" My voice cracked with desperation. ""Jasmine, please. My son is sick. The temperature is going to hit one hundred and ten degrees today. Just give us back one unit. Just one."" For a moment, something that might have been shame flickered across her features. But then she pulled out her phone, her fingers flying across the screen. ""Adam? Yes, it's me. Your wife is here harassing me and trying to steal back the air conditioners you gave me. She's making a scene in front of my neighbors."" I watched in horror as she painted me as the villain, her voice taking on that trembling quality that made her sound like a victim. Within minutes, Adam's familiar sedan screeched into the parking lot, and he emerged looking thunderous. ""Daniella, what the hell do you think you're doing?"" He strode over to us, immediately positioning himself between Jasmine and me like I was the threat. ""I'm trying to save our son from heat stroke!"" I shouted, no longer caring who heard. ""She's selling our units, Adam! Selling them!"" ""So what if she is?"" His words hit me like a slap. ""They're hers now. She can do whatever she wants with them."" ""Our son is sick!"" Tears of frustration burned my eyes. ""He's burning up, and you're defending her right to profit from his suffering?"" ""You're being hysterical,"" Adam said coldly. ""Apologize to Jasmine right now, or I'm calling the police for harassment."" The casual cruelty in his voice—the complete dismissal of our child's wellbeing—left me speechless. But as I stared at him, something else caught my eye. Something that made my heart stop. There, glinting on Jasmine's wrist, was my mother's bracelet. The delicate silver chain with its antique sapphire pendant had been my mother's most treasured piece, passed down through three generations of women in my family. I'd kept it in my jewelry box, taking it out only on special occasions to feel close to her memory. ""That's my bracelet,"" I whispered, the words barely audible. Jasmine's hand instinctively moved to cover the jewelry. ""I don't know what you're talking about."" ""My mother's bracelet. You took it from my jewelry box."" The violation felt even worse than the stolen air conditioning. This was personal. Sacred. I lunged forward, reaching for the clasp, but Jasmine jerked her arm away. In the struggle, the delicate chain snapped, and the bracelet fell to the scorching asphalt with a tiny, heartbreaking chime. For a moment, we all stared at it lying there—three generations of love and memory reduced to broken metal on hot pavement. Then Jasmine smiled. A cold, calculating smile that revealed her true nature. And she lifted her designer heel and crushed my mother's bracelet beneath it. The sapphire shattered with a sound like breaking glass, scattering blue fragments across the parking lot like tears. ""Oops,"" she said, her voice dripping with false sweetness. ""How clumsy of me."" I dropped to my knees, frantically trying to gather the pieces, but they were too small, too scattered. Destroyed. ""Jasmine didn't mean to do that,"" Adam said, his voice mechanical. ""You startled her. This is your fault, Daniella."" I looked up at my husband—this man I'd loved, married, built a life with—and saw a stranger. Someone who could watch his wife's most precious possession be deliberately destroyed and still defend the destroyer. Something inside me broke then, as surely as my mother's bracelet had broken. Something that had been holding me together through years of small betrayals and mounting indifference. I stood slowly, my hands still clutching the worthless fragments, and met Adam's eyes. ""Get away from me,"" I whispered. ""Both of you. Just... get away from me.""
Chapter 3

The words came out before I could stop them, raw and desperate in the suffocating heat of the parking lot. ""I want a divorce."" Adam's face went slack with shock, but it lasted only a moment before twisting into something ugly. ""You don't mean that."" ""I do."" My voice grew stronger, fueled by the sight of my mother's shattered bracelet scattered across the asphalt. ""I can't do this anymore, Adam. I won't let you destroy our son for her."" Jasmine's laugh cut through the air like broken glass. ""Oh, please. You're nothing without Adam, Daniella. Nothing."" She stepped closer, her designer heel grinding another sapphire fragment into dust. ""You should be grateful for what you have instead of throwing tantrums like a spoiled child."" ""Grateful?"" The word tasted bitter on my tongue. ""Grateful that my husband gave away our air conditioning while our son suffers? Grateful that you stole my mother's bracelet and destroyed it?"" ""I didn't steal anything,"" Jasmine said smoothly. ""Adam gave me access to the house. I saw something pretty and borrowed it. Not my fault you're so careless with your things."" Adam nodded, his face hardening with familiar stubbornness. ""Daniella, you're being hysterical. Threatening divorce over some jewelry and air conditioning? You don't mean it."" ""Watch me."" I stood slowly, my legs shaking but my resolve crystallizing like ice. ""I'll file the papers tomorrow."" ""No, you won't."" Adam's voice carried that condescending certainty that had worn me down for years. ""You need me. What would you do without me? You've never worked a day in your life."" Jasmine smirked, crossing her arms. ""Exactly. You're just a housewife with no skills and no money. Good luck surviving on your own."" Their words should have cut deep, should have made me doubt myself the way they always had. Instead, they felt like the final stones thrown at glass already shattered beyond repair. ""We'll see,"" I whispered, turning away from them both. I drove home in a haze of rage and determination, my hands trembling on the steering wheel. But when I pushed through our front door, the wall of heat that greeted me drove all other thoughts from my mind. The house felt like a tomb—airless, stifling, dangerous. ""Theo?"" I called out, my voice echoing in the oppressive silence. No answer. Panic clawed at my chest as I raced toward the living room. The leather couch where I'd left him sat empty, the throw pillows scattered on the floor. Ice water from the bowl I'd left had evaporated, leaving only a ring of moisture on the coffee table. ""Theo!"" I screamed, my voice cracking with terror. I found him in his bedroom, collapsed on the hardwood floor beside his bed. His small body lay motionless, his face flushed a dangerous crimson that made my heart stop. When I dropped to my knees beside him, his skin burned like fire beneath my palms. ""Baby, wake up,"" I whispered, gathering his limp form against my chest. ""Please, wake up."" His eyelids fluttered, and he made a soft whimpering sound that broke my heart. ""Mommy? I feel sick."" ""I know, sweetheart. I'm going to fix this."" I tried calling Adam seventeen times during the frantic drive to the hospital. Each call went straight to voicemail, his phone deliberately turned off. He was probably still with Jasmine, celebrating their victory over the hysterical housewife. The emergency room staff moved with practiced efficiency when they saw Theo's condition. Words like ""heat stroke"" and ""dangerously dehydrated"" floated around me as they hooked my son up to IV lines and monitors that beeped with mechanical urgency. ""His core temperature is 104.2,"" the doctor explained, her voice professional but kind. ""We need to cool him down gradually and restore his fluid levels. You got him here just in time."" Just in time. The words echoed in my head as I sat beside Theo's hospital bed, watching clear fluids drip into his tiny arm. Just in time because I'd finally stopped believing Adam's lies. Just in time because I'd finally chosen my son over my marriage. My phone buzzed with Adam's name, but I declined the call. Then again. And again. Finally, I turned it off. But there was one call I needed to make. My father answered on the second ring, his voice sharp with concern. ""Daniella? It's late. Is everything all right?"" ""No."" The word came out as a sob. ""Dad, I... I need help."" Silence stretched between us, filled with ten years of unspoken truths and carefully maintained pretenses. ""Where are you?"" His voice gentled, becoming the father I remembered from childhood rather than the distant businessman he'd been forced to become. ""Seattle Children's Hospital. Theo's sick. Heat stroke."" I pressed my free hand against my mouth, trying to hold back the flood of tears threatening to break free. ""Adam gave away our air conditioning. All of it. And I... I can't protect him anymore, Dad. I can't do this."" Another pause, and when he spoke again, his voice carried a weight of understanding that made my chest ache. ""The ten years are over, sweetheart. You've learned what you needed to learn."" ""I failed your test,"" I whispered. ""I married him anyway."" ""No,"" he said firmly. ""You passed it. You chose your son. You chose yourself. That's all I ever wanted."" As I sat there in the sterile hospital room, watching my son's chest rise and fall with steady breaths while machines monitored his recovery, I felt something shift inside me. The scared, apologetic woman who had begged for scraps of her husband's attention was dissolving, replaced by someone I barely recognized. Someone who would never again allow her child to suffer for another person's greed. Someone who was done being nothing.",3,1755740578.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False

“Two years,” Brandy purred. “We even have an anniversary.”

Chapter 1 - Caught In The Act.

               'There was a time when I thought that you did everything right, no lies, no wrong, boy, I must've been out of my mind'

                                                                                                                                                                                                    ~ Beyonce

Elena's P.O.V.

Jesus please forgive me for I have not yet sinned but I plan to and worst of all, I fear that I'll enjoy sinning more than I should and I'll take great pleasure in it so that I can get revenge on those who have dared to betray me.

You see lord, I made a really stupid decision when I was just a dumbass eighteen-year-old kid and I did so because I thought that I had found the love of my life, my other half, my soul mate but I was wrong and now I plan to rectify the mistake that I made seven years ago.

I just hope that you can forgive me my dear lord and you don't hold what I have to do against me because even you know that I've been through enough with this jackass.

I've always known my husband Tristan was a first-class jerk with a bad temper from the moment I first met him, in fact, I was warned by my father and older brother Brandon to stay away from him because they knew he was bad news from the very start but my stubborn, hot-headed ass wouldn't listen to them.

Now look at me.

Looking back now, I really wish that I had listened to them, maybe if I had then I wouldn't have been forced to live through seven years of pure torture at the hands of the very man I loved and who I thought loved me.

Lately, I've been looking for a way to escape my abusive marriage but I didn't know how and this thought pissed me off more than anything because I'm a very strong woman physically and I used to be strong mentally as well but years of being abused in every possible way by Tristan has fucked me up and left me the one thing I had never been which is vulnerable.

I had tried many ways to escape this torturous life including just simply filing for divorce but this plan backfired and resulted in me receiving a broken nose and wrist as well as several broken ribs amongst other injuries after Tristan found out and attacked me.

I was starting to think that maybe there wasn't a way out for me except for death but then seven months ago, I was finally given an out thanks to the wife of one of Tristan's business associates who had sent me a text message with a picture of my cheating, scumbag husband making out with my older sister Brandy on a beach while he was supposedly away on a business trip in the Bahamas.

I already knew Tristan was cheating on me because all of the classic signs were there like a huge blinking red light which I stupidly chose to ignore.

For example, the cheap perfume on him and his clothes when he would come home from work, the lipstick on his collar, the hickeys on his body and the secretive way he was with his phone but I didn't know who his whore was until I had received this text.

That was the day I put my plan into action to not only get revenge on the two people who have caused me so much pain but also to divorce my husband and finally free myself of him.

The first thing that I did was I sent the intimate photo of Brandy and Tristan to every major news outlet in America but that didn't do much to hurt them because Tristan's team immediately put out a statement saying it was A.I. created by trolls who were jealous of me and were trying to ruin my marriage.

The next thing I did was I 'accidentally' shredded an important file of Tristan's which he needed for an important business meeting that he had been working so hard on and it would've landed him a major million-dollar deal if he had managed to secure it but because of me, he didn't.

I also may or may not have let slip to the sister of a billionaire businessman from India who he was hoping to create a partnership with that Tristan was dating a girl who did OnlyFans for a living which automatically ended their partnership.

As for Brandy, the only thing I could do to her was hit her where it truly hurts and that's her job, so I called in a favour with an old friend of mine who is the owner of a top modelling agency in L.A. who my sister was signed to and he immediately cancelled her contract upon hearing about her extra-curricular activities.

To be fair, he was already planning on cancelling her contract anyway because he was getting fed up with her and her attitude, as well as her poor work ethic.

There's also the fact that he had received numerous complaints from other models who had issued an ultimatum to him that either she goes or they do because they can't stand her.

It's nice to know that I'm not the only one.

I know you may be thinking that I'm being petty and that I should just end it with him and leave with some pride and dignity still intact but I can't because they've put me through so much hell, more so my husband than my sister and these little losses feel like huge victories for me.

I've also been working on myself and my mental, physical and emotional strength these past seven months so that I can become the old Elena again.

The Elena who was feisty and strong and who would never in a million years take shit from anyone, especially not someone like her husband or sister.

I've been going to the gym every day and I've even attended some self-defence classes to brush up on my skills which seem to have been dormant lately.

I've also been reading some self-help books which have helped me to realise my worth and that I deserve better than the life I'm living right now.

The last thing I wanted was to become one of those women who say they're going to leave and then don't, I also wanted to make sure that I was strong enough to follow through with my plans because I don't want this life anymore.

I'm done.

Anyway, I've just arrived home after meeting with my dad and my lawyer to arrange a divorce which I'm going to get this time even if it kills me.

I was heading upstairs to my bedroom so that I could pack my things when I was greeted by the sounds of loud moans coming from it which left me feeling disturbed and disgusted but also very intrigued as well because I didn't know if there were animals or two human beings having sex in there.

Between Tristan's grunting like a constipated pig in distress and Brandy's high-pitched oh yeah every five seconds like an effeminate hyena, I couldn't differentiate if the noises came from them or animals.

Not to mention, the dirty talk between these two is...well, it's questionable and it made me think of the quote by Tatianna on RuPaul's Drag Race when she said we all make choices but that was a choice.

I walked over to the door and made sure I was quiet when I opened it so that I wouldn't startle or alert old McDonald's sex-craved farm animals.

I then leaned against the doorframe with my arms crossed over my chest as I watched in disgust at the sight in front of me which made me want to vomit.

Not because of who was having sex and where they were having it but because of the position they were currently in which looked both painful and uncomfortable.

There's also the fact that it's my sister who is naked on that bed and who the hell wants to see their sibling in their birthday suit? certainly not me, I can assure you.

""You know...I never understood what Beyonce meant when she said you showed your ass and I saw the real you but now I do because you Tristan Scott Lockwood have quite literally shown your ass and I'm finally starting to see the real you, it's just a shame that I'm seven years too late to dodge the bullet but hopefully, I can one day say you were the best thing I never had""

I said with a smile instantly startling the pair who quickly scrambled off the bed to hide their nudity.

Well, Tristan did, his stupid self actually fell off the bed and landed on his bare ass while Brandy on the other hand made a very lazy attempt to hide her nudity and I could tell that the bitch was revelling in what was going on and she didn't care if she was nude or not as it happened.

She's a model and an OnlyFans 'star', not to mention, she's fucked more men than a pornstar during their entire career, so go figure being naked doesn't faze her.

""Elena baby, wh..what...what are you doing here?""

""I was in the neighbourhood, I thought I'd stop by for a chat""

I say sarcastically.

""Ellie baby, this...""

Tristan said as he pointed his finger between himself and Brandy.

""This isn't what it looks like""

Tristan says and I roll my eyes.

""Why do cheating bastards like you always say it's not what it looks like when they've been caught in the act?""

I ask with irritation in my voice.

""You're naked and she's naked, you're a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess and Brandy...well, she's always been a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess from the moment puberty smacked her in the tits like a freight train""

I say and Brandy gasps while Tristan looks at me with a horrified and angry expression on his face.

""Not to mention, her hair looks like a rats nest, you've got scratch marks on your chest, back and ass, oh and the most obvious one is that your dick is currently wet and saluting the troops after braving the deep, dark trenches between my sister's legs...what the fuck else could it look like, Tristan? were you both playing a game of Twister?""

I ask with irritation and frustration in my voice.

""Baby, I swear, it's not...""

Tristan once again tried to plead his case but was cut off by a very frustrated and angry Brandy.

""Ignore him, Elena, it's exactly what it looks like, we were having sex right here in your marital bed""

Jesus Christ.

Someone should call the media and let them know that we've got a modern-day Albert Einstein on our hands.

I thought to myself whilst rubbing my forehead in frustration.

""Thanks for that, Brandy, I'm not sure I would've ever gotten the truth out of him without you here pointing out the obvious to me""

""You're welcome""

Brandy says with a smile as she pulls a face at Tristan who looks at her like what the fuck? and I don't blame him for feeling this way, to be honest with you.

This bitch wouldn't know what sarcasm is unless it came shaped like a dick and smacked her in the face.

""Ellie love, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen, it was a mistake""

""A mistake?""

I ask incredulously.

""A mistake is when you put salt on your cornflakes or in your morning coffee instead of sugar, Tristan, not when you repeatedly stick your cock inside of your sister in laws pussy""

""But this was a mistake, babe, I promise you...why don't I go and get dressed, so that we can go downstairs and talk, hmm?""

Translation, let's go downstairs so that I can manipulate you and make you believe my lies so that you won't try to leave me again.

""I'm just gonna go and...""

""How long?""

I cut Tristan off and he looks at me confused.

""What?""

""You heard me, Tristan""

I say while glaring at him.

""How long have you two been screwing each other behind my back?""

""N..not that long, Ellie""

Brandy says nervously as she shares a nervous look with Tristan.

""Well, how long is that then, Brandy? do you mean long as in you guys just had one long passionate night together? or is it long as in the length of your hit list of men who you've spread your legs to over the years? which one is it?""

I asked Brandy who looked at me wide-eyed like she couldn't believe I'd say something so vile and vulgar towards her.

""It's only been a few months, Elena, that's all""

Tristan said and I scoffed while rolling my eyes as Brandy's shocked expression quickly changed to a nasty glare as she sneered at my husband before looking back at me with an innocent butter wouldn't melt look on her face but her eyes gave away her true feelings and she was feeling very happy, proud and smug right now.

""He's lying to you, Elena, we've been having an affair for over two years now, in fact, we just celebrated our anniversary last month""

Wow.

""Brandy...""

Tristan said through gritted teeth but was cut off by my sister who feigned being frustrated and angry with him before softening her gaze and tone at me.

""No Tristan, she deserves to know the truth""

""You're right Brandy, I do, so tell me...when did your affair start?""

I asked them and I was confused when I saw Tristan's face pale as Brandy pretended to gulp.

I also wanted to know why they did this but knowing why my husband decided to step out on our marriage and break our vows seemed irrelevant and insignificant when Brandy said what she said next.

""After you found out your son was stillborn and you were forced to give birth to him while he was dead, you know the same day where you also found out that your chances of conceiving a child again were slim to none""

Brandy said her carefully crafted answer making sure to use the precise evil words to hit me right where it hurts but it only hurt me slightly before I felt myself growing numb to everything because I knew what she was telling me was the truth.

The reason why I know this is because the anniversary of my son's death was last month the same month as their quote-on-quote anniversary.

I've come to terms with the fact my husband is a lying, cheating scumbag and I've certainly come to terms with my sister being a nasty, attention-seeking whore but the one thing I'll never ever be able to come to terms with is my infertility, especially when someone who isn't even worthy of scraping the dog crap off the bottom of my shoe is using it to low blow me because she's an evil, vindictive bitch.

Just when I thought my sister couldn't sink any lower than she already has, the bitch then went on to say something which not only tore my heart into millions of little pieces but it also made me doubt my faith in God as well.

""It's probably a good thing that I'm currently pregnant so that the Lockwood name can continue on with this baby, isn't that right, my love?""

Brandy said with a smile as she reached for a shocked Tristan's hand.

It never ceases to amaze me how God will give people like Brandy the gift of fertility knowing full well she doesn't have a maternal bone in her body and only sees her baby as a meal ticket to money and a luxurious lifestyle while women like me, you know women who would love nothing more than to be a mom and have kids are left infertile, it's not fair.

I briefly closed my eyes and let out a slow, shaky breath to control my emotions and stop myself from crying before opening them again and looking directly at Tristan as I said five words to him which caused an array of different emotions to cross his face.

""I want a divorce, Tristan""

I said nonchalantly and he looked at me with a shocked expression before it changed to a look of pure, unadulterated rage.

""WHAT?""

He growled and that's when all hell broke loose.

Chapter 2 - True Colours.

Elena's P.O.V.

They say when you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes which is said to be a strange phenomenon known as a life review showing you everything you've experienced in life from the moment you were born to the moment you took your last breath but what does it mean if you experience this phenomenon and you live to tell the tale?.

After I had announced to Tristan and Brandy that I wanted a divorce, I left the room and headed downstairs to call my brother who I was hoping could help me find somewhere temporary to live until after my divorce is finalised but before I could even get my phone out of my pocket, I was viciously pushed to the ground by my husband who then straddled me and beat me black and blue until I eventually passed out.

I didn't come too until around twenty minutes ago and I was feeling so much pain but strangely enough, it was all physical pain, none of it was emotional or mental pain, I guess that's because I had already checked out of my marriage in that way a long time ago meaning there's nothing Tristan can do that could hurt me any more.

When I married my husband at the young and tender age of eighteen, I like many other people on the planet believed that we'd be together forever and that nothing could break us apart.

I thought our marriage could stand the test of time and that divorce was just a forbidden word that one never spoke of or thought about, kind of like the three monkeys hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil, well, it was like that.

I thought every single day of our marriage from the day we said I do to the day we would say our final goodbye and move on to the next life together would feel exactly like it did during the early days of our relationship which was filled with so much love, passion and lust.

I thought we'd do everything we could to make each other smile and feel happy but obviously, I was wrong because now, not even seven months after Tristan and I had celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary, I was here in our bedroom which was still a fucking mess thanks to the two lovebirds and I was packing my bags with determination in my heart to leave this place for good and divorce my husband as soon as possible.

Without context, most people would think we were just going through the seven-year itch and that I should think long and hard before I make any rash decisions that are permanent because I may or may not end up regretting it but that's not the case.

I guess you could say that I've had rose-tinted glasses on for the entirety of my relationship, from the moment I first met my husband to when he asked me to be his girlfriend when we were just teenagers in high school, right up to the very moment I had received that text message from my friend which blinded me from seeing the real Tristan.

Even though subconsciously I knew who he was and the type of man he was, I still refused to see the bad in him but now my eyes are clear and are wide open and any love I had for him or that I thought I had for him is long freaking gone.

""Come on, come on, Brand, pick up the phone""

I mutter into the phone.

""Shit""

I groaned when the line went dead.

This motherfucker has always got his phone glued to his hand and the one time I need his ass, he's MIA.

I've tried calling my brother umpteen times since I woke up from being unconscious but he's not answering me for whatever reason.

I once again tried to call Brandon as I continued to pack up all of my things and make sure that I've got everything that belonged to me because when I finally leave my former marital home, I plan on leaving it for good.

""Donovan here""

Oh, thank god, he answered me.

""Brand...Brand, it's me""

""Elena? Elena baby, is that you? what's wrong? is everything ok?""

Brandon asks sounding panicked which broke the wall in me causing me to break down.

""I..I need you, Brand, I can't do this anymore, I can't stay married to Tristan any longer, I..I'm done""

""Done? what do you mean you're done, Elena? what did he do? he hasn't hurt you again, has he?""

He asked angrily and I absentmindedly touched my lower lip which has been split open and bruised thanks to my delightful husband.

""Elena?...Elena sweetheart, talk to me, tell me what's going on?""

Brandon asked me and I sniffled.

I hated crying and I hated feeling weak and vulnerable because I've always been a strong woman but even the strongest of people are allowed to have a weak moment and this was mine.

""Can you just please come to my place and get me, Brand? I'm leaving Tristan and this time it's for good, I'm not gonna tolerate his abuse any more""

Brandon is the only one who knows about the abuse my husband has put me through these past seven years but he didn't find out about it because I wanted him to, no, it was because he had walked into my room unannounced while I was getting changed and he saw a massive bruise on my back, as well as several other bruises on my abdomen.

Tristan has always been very meticulous when it comes to hitting me because he knows I'm a strong girl who can easily defend herself against anyone, so he only makes sure to hit me when he knows I'm vulnerable and he always makes sure to hit me in areas which can't be seen and can easily be covered up.

In fact, today was the first time he lost control of himself and hit me square in the face, as well as attempting to choke me out leaving marks on my face and neck.

Brandon wasn't happy when he found out about the abuse, in fact, he was apoplectic and told me that he wanted to call in some of his army buddies to teach Tristan a lesson which I stupidly put a stop to but I wouldn't this time if he gave me this option.

""What do you mean, kid? what's he done?""

""I'm done, Brand, I'm so done""

I sobbed as I sat down on my bed and ran a hand through my hair as fresh tears filled my eyes and fell down my face.

""He cheated on me, Brand...he fucking cheated on me and when I confronted him about it and told him that I wanted a divorce, he went crazy and attacked me""

""He what?""

Brandon growled causing me to flinch.

""You heard me, Brand""

I whimpered as my body shook with sobs.

""He's been cheating on me, he's been having an affair for two fucking years of our marriage and you'll never guess who the skank is who he's been screwing behind my back with""

""Who is it? is it someone we know?""

Brandon asks me and I chuckle.

""Oh yeah, it's someone we know very well, Brandon...it's Brandy""

""What? Brandy?""

Brandon asks sounding shocked.

""I'm sorry, I think I misheard you, kiddo, did you just say Brandy as in my twin sister and your older sister, that Brandy? is that who you're talking about, Elena Jade?""

""Yep""

I say as I let out a sigh and run my hand through my hair wincing as I did when my hand brushed against a painful spot.

I quickly pulled my hand away and looked down at it where I was shocked but not surprised to find some blood coating my fingers.

Well, that's new.

""I can't believe this, Ellie, I can't believe Brandy would do something like this to you""

He says and I scoff.

""Really, Brand? can you really not believe it? because I can""

I say with annoyance and anger in my tone.

""Brandy's always wanted what was mine and I knew it was only a matter of time before she eventually put the moves on Tristan, I just hoped and prayed that she'd have enough pride and dignity in her to leave him alone""

""Pride and dignity""

Brandon said with a chuckle.

""You're talking about the same girl who opened up an OnlyFans account to celebrate her twenty-fifth birthday posting naked pictures and videos of herself every day, not to mention videos of her doing sexual things to herself and others bringing shame to our family name, that girl, right?""

""Yeah, I am""

I groaned in disgust while chuckling.

""Wait, how do you know what she does on there?""

I ask with a raised eyebrow and Brandon groans.

""Some of my friends have seen her content and told me about it, one of them even showed me a video of her in a gangbang with five guys because he didn't know we were related and thought I'd like it""

Hmm, nice.

I thought to myself sarcastically.

""Anyway, it doesn't matter because I don't care anymore, Brand, the biggest asshole in the world can now be with the number one asshole flasher in the world for all I care, I just want to be free of them""

I said and Brandon chuckled but it was only briefly.

""Do you really want Brandy to be with an abusive bastard like Tristan, Elle?...I mean, don't get me wrong, sweetheart, I hate them both for what they've put you through but nobody, not even Brandy deserves to be in a relationship with a scumbag who beats women the way he does with you, kiddo""

Brandon says with concern in his voice.

""Normally I'd agree with you, Brand but to be honest with you, brother...I don't think she cares""

""Why do you say that?""

He asks sounding confused while I let out a shaky breath to once again control my emotions.

""Because she just stood there and watched as Tristan beat me, Brand""

I said as a stray tear fell down my cheek causing a stinging sensation as it landed on a cut.

""What did you just say, Elena?""

Brandon asks sounding horrified and shocked.

""You heard me, Brandon""

I said as I let out a breath.

""At first, I thought I was seeing things when I saw her standing to the side and watching with a happy glint in her eyes and a smirk on her evil face...I thought Tristan's hits were messing with my head making me see things that weren't there but no, she was there and she was revelling in it""

""That bitch""

Brandon groaned under his breath.

""Ok kiddo listen to me, go and pack your stuff and meet me out front, I'm already in Black Hawk and I'll be at your place in ten minutes""

""Ok, thank you, Brandon""

""You're welcome, Ellie Bear""

Brandon says and I smile.

We then bid each other goodbye and I finish packing my things and taking them downstairs.

I didn't have much because unlike my sister, I'm not a flashy person and I prefer to put my hard-earned money to good use which will benefit me later on instead of wasting it on something I'll barely ever use because I 'need' them or because I need and want to show them off to unimportant people so that they'll know or at least think I'm rich.

I'm also not interested in anything designer or even expensive jewellery and if there's any of that shit in my closet then it's because Tristan bought it for me, I only buy what I need and that's it.

I was in the middle of bringing the last of my things downstairs which wasn't easy considering my ribs felt like they were broken and were playing kerplunk with my insides when my soon-to-be ex-husband and my slutty sister walked in like nothing had happened.

""What the fuck is going on in here?""

""Aww, it looks like she's taking out the trash, baby""

Brandy says with a smirk earning a glare from both myself and Tristan.

""Shut the fuck up, Brandy""

Tristan growls and she flinches as I roll my eyes.

""Actually Brandy, Tristan is the one who deals with the trash around here, not me, I've got more class unlike some people who are more than happy to touch some nasty, used, washed up, disgusting, piece of shit trash, in fact, he loves it, case and point""

I say with a smirk as I pointed my finger at my sister who glares at me while Tristan looks at me with shock evident on his stupid face.

For years, everyone in town including most of my family and my husband have believed that I loved and idolised my sister and that's because I didn't want anyone to know how much I truly despised the bitch.

The reason why is because if I do show my true feelings for her then that not only gives her even more attention which she doesn't need or deserve but it also gives her a new stage to play the hard done by victim which she would've milked dry because let's face it, it's easy to sympathise with someone who's hated by a sibling, especially if we don't know the reason why.

""Babe, did you hear what she just said to...""

""Oh and Brandy""

I cut my sister off from her whining.

""If I were you, my dear sister, then I'd learn how to do this thing which is foreign to whores such as yourself and it's a little something called keeping your mouth shut because if you don't and you continue to run yours like the silly little bitch that you are then I'll have no other choice but to give you one hell of a beating, one where your plastic surgeon will have no other choice but to make you pay for your procedures this time instead of accepting an old fashioned downstairs handshake and a slurpy for payment if you catch my drift""

I say with a smirk.

""That's enough, Elena...you're out of order""

Tristan growls and my face narrows in confusion.

""I'm out of order?""

What does he think I am? a Coca Cola machine?.

I thought to myself while rolling my eyes.

""Yes, you're out of order, Elena, now apologise to your sister""

Tristan says and I chuckle.

This man has lost his mind.

""I'd rather French kiss a bulldog with herpes than lower myself to her level and apologise for telling the truth, Tristan""

I said with a sneer.

""Maybe next time you have an affair, you should try sticking your cock in someone who has actually got a backbone and has got the stones to face the wrath of her lover's wife instead of cowering behind him like a pathetic little wimp...you're an embarrassment to women everywhere, Brandy""

""Elena""

Tristan said through gritted teeth pissing me off.

""What, Tristan?...doesn't your mistress like to hear the truth? well, she should remember this day then so that she'll be reminded to keep her legs closed to married men in the future and save herself from any further embarrassment, shouldn't she?""

I sneered at Brandy who whimpered and moved closer to my husband as she feigned innocence and played the wounded victim card to gain sympathy from Tristan which she got but I could see right through her act as smugness swam deep in her eyes.

""Don't be upset with my sister, baby, Elena's got every right to be angry and upset with me, I mean, after all, I did steal her husband away from her and I ruined her life, not to mention, I've also been successful in giving you the one thing she can't""

Brandy said whilst gently caressing her stomach.

Her words were like a red flag to a bull and she was successful in provoking me and flipping my bitch switch but it was Tristan's response which shocked me even though it shouldn't have because hurting me is almost like second nature to him now.

""I know, baby, she's just jealous, that's all""

He said whilst kissing Brandy's temple and rubbing her stomach as she smirked victoriously and mouthed I win again at me.

""You evil, spiteful bitch""

I growled as I stormed over to my sister intending to beat her ass and cause her a world of pain but before I could get close to her, Tristan grabbed me by my hair and viciously threw me against the staircase causing me to bang my head against the hard marble.

I instantly became drowsy and I could feel myself losing consciousness as I heard three voices speak but it was the latter one which filled me with relief and happiness as everything turned black.

""Oh fuck...Elena baby, are you ok?""

Tristan asked sounding panicked.

""Oh my god, Tristan, what did you do?""

Brandy gasped sounding like she actually cared and was worried for me for the first time ever.

I felt a hand gently caress my cheek as a loud, angry voice boomed throughout the hallway.

""WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN HERE?...holy shit, Elena""

Elena's P.O.V.

Jesus please forgive me for I have not yet sinned but I plan to and worst of all, I fear that I'll enjoy sinning more than I should and I'll take great pleasure in it so that I can get revenge on those who have dared to betray me.

You see lord, I made a really stupid decision when I was just a dumbass eighteen-year-old kid and I did so because I thought that I had found the love of my life, my other half, my soul mate but I was wrong and now I plan to rectify the mistake that I made seven years ago.

I just hope that you can forgive me my dear lord and you don't hold what I have to do against me because even you know that I've been through enough with this jackass.

I've always known my husband Tristan was a first-class jerk with a bad temper from the moment I first met him, in fact, I was warned by my father and older brother Brandon to stay away from him because they knew he was bad news from the very start but my stubborn, hot-headed ass wouldn't listen to them.

Now look at me.

Looking back now, I really wish that I had listened to them, maybe if I had then I wouldn't have been forced to live through seven years of pure torture at the hands of the very man I loved and who I thought loved me.

Lately, I've been looking for a way to escape my abusive marriage but I didn't know how and this thought pissed me off more than anything because I'm a very strong woman physically and I used to be strong mentally as well but years of being abused in every possible way by Tristan has fucked me up and left me the one thing I had never been which is vulnerable.

I had tried many ways to escape this torturous life including just simply filing for divorce but this plan backfired and resulted in me receiving a broken nose and wrist as well as several broken ribs amongst other injuries after Tristan found out and attacked me.

I was starting to think that maybe there wasn't a way out for me except for death but then seven months ago, I was finally given an out thanks to the wife of one of Tristan's business associates who had sent me a text message with a picture of my cheating, scumbag husband making out with my older sister Brandy on a beach while he was supposedly away on a business trip in the Bahamas.

I already knew Tristan was cheating on me because all of the classic signs were there like a huge blinking red light which I stupidly chose to ignore.

For example, the cheap perfume on him and his clothes when he would come home from work, the lipstick on his collar, the hickeys on his body and the secretive way he was with his phone but I didn't know who his whore was until I had received this text.

That was the day I put my plan into action to not only get revenge on the two people who have caused me so much pain but also to divorce my husband and finally free myself of him.

The first thing that I did was I sent the intimate photo of Brandy and Tristan to every major news outlet in America but that didn't do much to hurt them because Tristan's team immediately put out a statement saying it was A.I. created by trolls who were jealous of me and were trying to ruin my marriage.

The next thing I did was I 'accidentally' shredded an important file of Tristan's which he needed for an important business meeting that he had been working so hard on and it would've landed him a major million-dollar deal if he had managed to secure it but because of me, he didn't.

I also may or may not have let slip to the sister of a billionaire businessman from India who he was hoping to create a partnership with that Tristan was dating a girl who did OnlyFans for a living which automatically ended their partnership.

As for Brandy, the only thing I could do to her was hit her where it truly hurts and that's her job, so I called in a favour with an old friend of mine who is the owner of a top modelling agency in L.A. who my sister was signed to and he immediately cancelled her contract upon hearing about her extra-curricular activities.

To be fair, he was already planning on cancelling her contract anyway because he was getting fed up with her and her attitude, as well as her poor work ethic.

There's also the fact that he had received numerous complaints from other models who had issued an ultimatum to him that either she goes or they do because they can't stand her.

It's nice to know that I'm not the only one.

I know you may be thinking that I'm being petty and that I should just end it with him and leave with some pride and dignity still intact but I can't because they've put me through so much hell, more so my husband than my sister and these little losses feel like huge victories for me.

I've also been working on myself and my mental, physical and emotional strength these past seven months so that I can become the old Elena again.

The Elena who was feisty and strong and who would never in a million years take shit from anyone, especially not someone like her husband or sister.

I've been going to the gym every day and I've even attended some self-defence classes to brush up on my skills which seem to have been dormant lately.

I've also been reading some self-help books which have helped me to realise my worth and that I deserve better than the life I'm living right now.

The last thing I wanted was to become one of those women who say they're going to leave and then don't, I also wanted to make sure that I was strong enough to follow through with my plans because I don't want this life anymore.

I'm done.

Anyway, I've just arrived home after meeting with my dad and my lawyer to arrange a divorce which I'm going to get this time even if it kills me.

I was heading upstairs to my bedroom so that I could pack my things when I was greeted by the sounds of loud moans coming from it which left me feeling disturbed and disgusted but also very intrigued as well because I didn't know if there were animals or two human beings having sex in there.

Between Tristan's grunting like a constipated pig in distress and Brandy's high-pitched oh yeah every five seconds like an effeminate hyena, I couldn't differentiate if the noises came from them or animals.

Not to mention, the dirty talk between these two is...well, it's questionable and it made me think of the quote by Tatianna on RuPaul's Drag Race when she said we all make choices but that was a choice.

I walked over to the door and made sure I was quiet when I opened it so that I wouldn't startle or alert old McDonald's sex-craved farm animals.

I then leaned against the doorframe with my arms crossed over my chest as I watched in disgust at the sight in front of me which made me want to vomit.

Not because of who was having sex and where they were having it but because of the position they were currently in which looked both painful and uncomfortable.

There's also the fact that it's my sister who is naked on that bed and who the hell wants to see their sibling in their birthday suit? certainly not me, I can assure you.

""You know...I never understood what Beyonce meant when she said you showed your ass and I saw the real you but now I do because you Tristan Scott Lockwood have quite literally shown your ass and I'm finally starting to see the real you, it's just a shame that I'm seven years too late to dodge the bullet but hopefully, I can one day say you were the best thing I never had""

I said with a smile instantly startling the pair who quickly scrambled off the bed to hide their nudity.

Well, Tristan did, his stupid self actually fell off the bed and landed on his bare ass while Brandy on the other hand made a very lazy attempt to hide her nudity and I could tell that the bitch was revelling in what was going on and she didn't care if she was nude or not as it happened.

She's a model and an OnlyFans 'star', not to mention, she's fucked more men than a pornstar during their entire career, so go figure being naked doesn't faze her.

""Elena baby, wh..what...what are you doing here?""

""I was in the neighbourhood, I thought I'd stop by for a chat""

I say sarcastically.

""Ellie baby, this...""

Tristan said as he pointed his finger between himself and Brandy.

""This isn't what it looks like""

Tristan says and I roll my eyes.

""Why do cheating bastards like you always say it's not what it looks like when they've been caught in the act?""

I ask with irritation in my voice.

""You're naked and she's naked, you're a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess and Brandy...well, she's always been a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess from the moment puberty smacked her in the tits like a freight train""

I say and Brandy gasps while Tristan looks at me with a horrified and angry expression on his face.

""Not to mention, her hair looks like a rats nest, you've got scratch marks on your chest, back and ass, oh and the most obvious one is that your dick is currently wet and saluting the troops after braving the deep, dark trenches between my sister's legs...what the fuck else could it look like, Tristan? were you both playing a game of Twister?""

I ask with irritation and frustration in my voice.

""Baby, I swear, it's not...""

Tristan once again tried to plead his case but was cut off by a very frustrated and angry Brandy.

""Ignore him, Elena, it's exactly what it looks like, we were having sex right here in your marital bed""

Jesus Christ.

Someone should call the media and let them know that we've got a modern-day Albert Einstein on our hands.

I thought to myself whilst rubbing my forehead in frustration.

""Thanks for that, Brandy, I'm not sure I would've ever gotten the truth out of him without you here pointing out the obvious to me""

""You're welcome""

Brandy says with a smile as she pulls a face at Tristan who looks at her like what the fuck? and I don't blame him for feeling this way, to be honest with you.

This bitch wouldn't know what sarcasm is unless it came shaped like a dick and smacked her in the face.

""Ellie love, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen, it was a mistake""

""A mistake?""

I ask incredulously.

""A mistake is when you put salt on your cornflakes or in your morning coffee instead of sugar, Tristan, not when you repeatedly stick your cock inside of your sister in laws pussy""

""But this was a mistake, babe, I promise you...why don't I go and get dressed, so that we can go downstairs and talk, hmm?""

Translation, let's go downstairs so that I can manipulate you and make you believe my lies so that you won't try to leave me again.

""I'm just gonna go and...""

""How long?""

I cut Tristan off and he looks at me confused.

""What?""

""You heard me, Tristan""

I say while glaring at him.

""How long have you two been screwing each other behind my back?""

""N..not that long, Ellie""

Brandy says nervously as she shares a nervous look with Tristan.

""Well, how long is that then, Brandy? do you mean long as in you guys just had one long passionate night together? or is it long as in the length of your hit list of men who you've spread your legs to over the years? which one is it?""

I asked Brandy who looked at me wide-eyed like she couldn't believe I'd say something so vile and vulgar towards her.

""It's only been a few months, Elena, that's all""

Tristan said and I scoffed while rolling my eyes as Brandy's shocked expression quickly changed to a nasty glare as she sneered at my husband before looking back at me with an innocent butter wouldn't melt look on her face but her eyes gave away her true feelings and she was feeling very happy, proud and smug right now.

""He's lying to you, Elena, we've been having an affair for over two years now, in fact, we just celebrated our anniversary last month""

Wow.

""Brandy...""

Tristan said through gritted teeth but was cut off by my sister who feigned being frustrated and angry with him before softening her gaze and tone at me.

""No Tristan, she deserves to know the truth""

""You're right Brandy, I do, so tell me...when did your affair start?""

I asked them and I was confused when I saw Tristan's face pale as Brandy pretended to gulp.

I also wanted to know why they did this but knowing why my husband decided to step out on our marriage and break our vows seemed irrelevant and insignificant when Brandy said what she said next.

""After you found out your son was stillborn and you were forced to give birth to him while he was dead, you know the same day where you also found out that your chances of conceiving a child again were slim to none""

Brandy said her carefully crafted answer making sure to use the precise evil words to hit me right where it hurts but it only hurt me slightly before I felt myself growing numb to everything because I knew what she was telling me was the truth.

The reason why I know this is because the anniversary of my son's death was last month the same month as their quote-on-quote anniversary.

I've come to terms with the fact my husband is a lying, cheating scumbag and I've certainly come to terms with my sister being a nasty, attention-seeking whore but the one thing I'll never ever be able to come to terms with is my infertility, especially when someone who isn't even worthy of scraping the dog crap off the bottom of my shoe is using it to low blow me because she's an evil, vindictive bitch.

Just when I thought my sister couldn't sink any lower than she already has, the bitch then went on to say something which not only tore my heart into millions of little pieces but it also made me doubt my faith in God as well.

""It's probably a good thing that I'm currently pregnant so that the Lockwood name can continue on with this baby, isn't that right, my love?""

Brandy said with a smile as she reached for a shocked Tristan's hand.

It never ceases to amaze me how God will give people like Brandy the gift of fertility knowing full well she doesn't have a maternal bone in her body and only sees her baby as a meal ticket to money and a luxurious lifestyle while women like me, you know women who would love nothing more than to be a mom and have kids are left infertile, it's not fair.

I briefly closed my eyes and let out a slow, shaky breath to control my emotions and stop myself from crying before opening them again and looking directly at Tristan as I said five words to him which caused an array of different emotions to cross his face.

""I want a divorce, Tristan""

I said nonchalantly and he looked at me with a shocked expression before it changed to a look of pure, unadulterated rage.

""WHAT?""

He growled and that's when all hell broke loose.

Chapter 2 - True Colours.

Elena's P.O.V.

They say when you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes which is said to be a strange phenomenon known as a life review showing you everything you've experienced in life from the moment you were born to the moment you took your last breath but what does it mean if you experience this phenomenon and you live to tell the tale?.

After I had announced to Tristan and Brandy that I wanted a divorce, I left the room and headed downstairs to call my brother who I was hoping could help me find somewhere temporary to live until after my divorce is finalised but before I could even get my phone out of my pocket, I was viciously pushed to the ground by my husband who then straddled me and beat me black and blue until I eventually passed out.

I didn't come too until around twenty minutes ago and I was feeling so much pain but strangely enough, it was all physical pain, none of it was emotional or mental pain, I guess that's because I had already checked out of my marriage in that way a long time ago meaning there's nothing Tristan can do that could hurt me any more.

When I married my husband at the young and tender age of eighteen, I like many other people on the planet believed that we'd be together forever and that nothing could break us apart.

I thought our marriage could stand the test of time and that divorce was just a forbidden word that one never spoke of or thought about, kind of like the three monkeys hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil, well, it was like that.

I thought every single day of our marriage from the day we said I do to the day we would say our final goodbye and move on to the next life together would feel exactly like it did during the early days of our relationship which was filled with so much love, passion and lust.

I thought we'd do everything we could to make each other smile and feel happy but obviously, I was wrong because now, not even seven months after Tristan and I had celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary, I was here in our bedroom which was still a fucking mess thanks to the two lovebirds and I was packing my bags with determination in my heart to leave this place for good and divorce my husband as soon as possible.

Without context, most people would think we were just going through the seven-year itch and that I should think long and hard before I make any rash decisions that are permanent because I may or may not end up regretting it but that's not the case.

I guess you could say that I've had rose-tinted glasses on for the entirety of my relationship, from the moment I first met my husband to when he asked me to be his girlfriend when we were just teenagers in high school, right up to the very moment I had received that text message from my friend which blinded me from seeing the real Tristan.

Even though subconsciously I knew who he was and the type of man he was, I still refused to see the bad in him but now my eyes are clear and are wide open and any love I had for him or that I thought I had for him is long freaking gone.

""Come on, come on, Brand, pick up the phone""

I mutter into the phone.

""Shit""

I groaned when the line went dead.

This motherfucker has always got his phone glued to his hand and the one time I need his ass, he's MIA.

I've tried calling my brother umpteen times since I woke up from being unconscious but he's not answering me for whatever reason.

I once again tried to call Brandon as I continued to pack up all of my things and make sure that I've got everything that belonged to me because when I finally leave my former marital home, I plan on leaving it for good.

""Donovan here""

Oh, thank god, he answered me.

""Brand...Brand, it's me""

""Elena? Elena baby, is that you? what's wrong? is everything ok?""

Brandon asks sounding panicked which broke the wall in me causing me to break down.

""I..I need you, Brand, I can't do this anymore, I can't stay married to Tristan any longer, I..I'm done""

""Done? what do you mean you're done, Elena? what did he do? he hasn't hurt you again, has he?""

He asked angrily and I absentmindedly touched my lower lip which has been split open and bruised thanks to my delightful husband.

""Elena?...Elena sweetheart, talk to me, tell me what's going on?""

Brandon asked me and I sniffled.

I hated crying and I hated feeling weak and vulnerable because I've always been a strong woman but even the strongest of people are allowed to have a weak moment and this was mine.

""Can you just please come to my place and get me, Brand? I'm leaving Tristan and this time it's for good, I'm not gonna tolerate his abuse any more""

Brandon is the only one who knows about the abuse my husband has put me through these past seven years but he didn't find out about it because I wanted him to, no, it was because he had walked into my room unannounced while I was getting changed and he saw a massive bruise on my back, as well as several other bruises on my abdomen.

Tristan has always been very meticulous when it comes to hitting me because he knows I'm a strong girl who can easily defend herself against anyone, so he only makes sure to hit me when he knows I'm vulnerable and he always makes sure to hit me in areas which can't be seen and can easily be covered up.

In fact, today was the first time he lost control of himself and hit me square in the face, as well as attempting to choke me out leaving marks on my face and neck.

Brandon wasn't happy when he found out about the abuse, in fact, he was apoplectic and told me that he wanted to call in some of his army buddies to teach Tristan a lesson which I stupidly put a stop to but I wouldn't this time if he gave me this option.

""What do you mean, kid? what's he done?""

""I'm done, Brand, I'm so done""

I sobbed as I sat down on my bed and ran a hand through my hair as fresh tears filled my eyes and fell down my face.

""He cheated on me, Brand...he fucking cheated on me and when I confronted him about it and told him that I wanted a divorce, he went crazy and attacked me""

""He what?""

Brandon growled causing me to flinch.

""You heard me, Brand""

I whimpered as my body shook with sobs.

""He's been cheating on me, he's been having an affair for two fucking years of our marriage and you'll never guess who the skank is who he's been screwing behind my back with""

""Who is it? is it someone we know?""

Brandon asks me and I chuckle.

""Oh yeah, it's someone we know very well, Brandon...it's Brandy""

""What? Brandy?""

Brandon asks sounding shocked.

""I'm sorry, I think I misheard you, kiddo, did you just say Brandy as in my twin sister and your older sister, that Brandy? is that who you're talking about, Elena Jade?""

""Yep""

I say as I let out a sigh and run my hand through my hair wincing as I did when my hand brushed against a painful spot.

I quickly pulled my hand away and looked down at it where I was shocked but not surprised to find some blood coating my fingers.

Well, that's new.

""I can't believe this, Ellie, I can't believe Brandy would do something like this to you""

He says and I scoff.

""Really, Brand? can you really not believe it? because I can""

I say with annoyance and anger in my tone.

""Brandy's always wanted what was mine and I knew it was only a matter of time before she eventually put the moves on Tristan, I just hoped and prayed that she'd have enough pride and dignity in her to leave him alone""

""Pride and dignity""

Brandon said with a chuckle.

""You're talking about the same girl who opened up an OnlyFans account to celebrate her twenty-fifth birthday posting naked pictures and videos of herself every day, not to mention videos of her doing sexual things to herself and others bringing shame to our family name, that girl, right?""

""Yeah, I am""

I groaned in disgust while chuckling.

""Wait, how do you know what she does on there?""

I ask with a raised eyebrow and Brandon groans.

""Some of my friends have seen her content and told me about it, one of them even showed me a video of her in a gangbang with five guys because he didn't know we were related and thought I'd like it""

Hmm, nice.

I thought to myself sarcastically.

""Anyway, it doesn't matter because I don't care anymore, Brand, the biggest asshole in the world can now be with the number one asshole flasher in the world for all I care, I just want to be free of them""

I said and Brandon chuckled but it was only briefly.

""Do you really want Brandy to be with an abusive bastard like Tristan, Elle?...I mean, don't get me wrong, sweetheart, I hate them both for what they've put you through but nobody, not even Brandy deserves to be in a relationship with a scumbag who beats women the way he does with you, kiddo""

Brandon says with concern in his voice.

""Normally I'd agree with you, Brand but to be honest with you, brother...I don't think she cares""

""Why do you say that?""

He asks sounding confused while I let out a shaky breath to once again control my emotions.

""Because she just stood there and watched as Tristan beat me, Brand""

I said as a stray tear fell down my cheek causing a stinging sensation as it landed on a cut.

""What did you just say, Elena?""

Brandon asks sounding horrified and shocked.

""You heard me, Brandon""

I said as I let out a breath.

""At first, I thought I was seeing things when I saw her standing to the side and watching with a happy glint in her eyes and a smirk on her evil face...I thought Tristan's hits were messing with my head making me see things that weren't there but no, she was there and she was revelling in it""

""That bitch""

Brandon groaned under his breath.

""Ok kiddo listen to me, go and pack your stuff and meet me out front, I'm already in Black Hawk and I'll be at your place in ten minutes""

""Ok, thank you, Brandon""

""You're welcome, Ellie Bear""

Brandon says and I smile.

We then bid each other goodbye and I finish packing my things and taking them downstairs.

I didn't have much because unlike my sister, I'm not a flashy person and I prefer to put my hard-earned money to good use which will benefit me later on instead of wasting it on something I'll barely ever use because I 'need' them or because I need and want to show them off to unimportant people so that they'll know or at least think I'm rich.

I'm also not interested in anything designer or even expensive jewellery and if there's any of that shit in my closet then it's because Tristan bought it for me, I only buy what I need and that's it.

I was in the middle of bringing the last of my things downstairs which wasn't easy considering my ribs felt like they were broken and were playing kerplunk with my insides when my soon-to-be ex-husband and my slutty sister walked in like nothing had happened.

""What the fuck is going on in here?""

""Aww, it looks like she's taking out the trash, baby""

Brandy says with a smirk earning a glare from both myself and Tristan.

""Shut the fuck up, Brandy""

Tristan growls and she flinches as I roll my eyes.

""Actually Brandy, Tristan is the one who deals with the trash around here, not me, I've got more class unlike some people who are more than happy to touch some nasty, used, washed up, disgusting, piece of shit trash, in fact, he loves it, case and point""

I say with a smirk as I pointed my finger at my sister who glares at me while Tristan looks at me with shock evident on his stupid face.

For years, everyone in town including most of my family and my husband have believed that I loved and idolised my sister and that's because I didn't want anyone to know how much I truly despised the bitch.

The reason why is because if I do show my true feelings for her then that not only gives her even more attention which she doesn't need or deserve but it also gives her a new stage to play the hard done by victim which she would've milked dry because let's face it, it's easy to sympathise with someone who's hated by a sibling, especially if we don't know the reason why.

""Babe, did you hear what she just said to...""

""Oh and Brandy""

I cut my sister off from her whining.

""If I were you, my dear sister, then I'd learn how to do this thing which is foreign to whores such as yourself and it's a little something called keeping your mouth shut because if you don't and you continue to run yours like the silly little bitch that you are then I'll have no other choice but to give you one hell of a beating, one where your plastic surgeon will have no other choice but to make you pay for your procedures this time instead of accepting an old fashioned downstairs handshake and a slurpy for payment if you catch my drift""

I say with a smirk.

""That's enough, Elena...you're out of order""

Tristan growls and my face narrows in confusion.

""I'm out of order?""

What does he think I am? a Coca Cola machine?.

I thought to myself while rolling my eyes.

""Yes, you're out of order, Elena, now apologise to your sister""

Tristan says and I chuckle.

This man has lost his mind.

""I'd rather French kiss a bulldog with herpes than lower myself to her level and apologise for telling the truth, Tristan""

I said with a sneer.

""Maybe next time you have an affair, you should try sticking your cock in someone who has actually got a backbone and has got the stones to face the wrath of her lover's wife instead of cowering behind him like a pathetic little wimp...you're an embarrassment to women everywhere, Brandy""

""Elena""

Tristan said through gritted teeth pissing me off.

""What, Tristan?...doesn't your mistress like to hear the truth? well, she should remember this day then so that she'll be reminded to keep her legs closed to married men in the future and save herself from any further embarrassment, shouldn't she?""

I sneered at Brandy who whimpered and moved closer to my husband as she feigned innocence and played the wounded victim card to gain sympathy from Tristan which she got but I could see right through her act as smugness swam deep in her eyes.

""Don't be upset with my sister, baby, Elena's got every right to be angry and upset with me, I mean, after all, I did steal her husband away from her and I ruined her life, not to mention, I've also been successful in giving you the one thing she can't""

Brandy said whilst gently caressing her stomach.

Her words were like a red flag to a bull and she was successful in provoking me and flipping my bitch switch but it was Tristan's response which shocked me even though it shouldn't have because hurting me is almost like second nature to him now.

""I know, baby, she's just jealous, that's all""

He said whilst kissing Brandy's temple and rubbing her stomach as she smirked victoriously and mouthed I win again at me.

""You evil, spiteful bitch""

I growled as I stormed over to my sister intending to beat her ass and cause her a world of pain but before I could get close to her, Tristan grabbed me by my hair and viciously threw me against the staircase causing me to bang my head against the hard marble.

I instantly became drowsy and I could feel myself losing consciousness as I heard three voices speak but it was the latter one which filled me with relief and happiness as everything turned black.

""Oh fuck...Elena baby, are you ok?""

Tristan asked sounding panicked.

""Oh my god, Tristan, what did you do?""

Brandy gasped sounding like she actually cared and was worried for me for the first time ever.

I felt a hand gently caress my cheek as a loud, angry voice boomed throughout the hallway.

""WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN HERE?...holy shit, Elena""

“Hear me out, Elena—this isn’t what it looks like.”
“Then why are you both naked in my bed, Tristan?”
My husband scrambled for a sheet. My sister didn’t bother.
“How long?”
“A few months,” he lied.
“Two years,” Brandy purred. “We even have an anniversary.”
Silence. Then the kill shot: “I’m pregnant. The Lockwood name is safe.”
Something in me went cold.
“I want a divorce, Tristan.”
“WHAT?”
His hands found my hair, the marble found my skull—darkness.
When I woke, hospital lights hummed and my brother’s voice steadied. “I’ve got you.”
A nurse whispered, “Concussion, fractured ribs,” while a doctor snapped photos for the chart.
Blood drawn. Sedatives flagged. Evidence bagged.

I called a judge. Protective order—granted.

He brought roses to the hallway and a trembling apology.
I brought receipts—ER scans, timestamps, the date they celebrated over my grief.
“Assault isn’t love,” I told him. “And lies don’t glitch in 4K.”

Brandy cradled a flat stomach and practiced tears for the cameras.
Mom called me dramatic.
My uncle Rage called it what it was.

“Come home,” Tristan begged.
“Come to court,” I answered.

Deals fell through. Statements fell apart. His voice fell to a whisper on voicemail twenty-seven: I’m sorry.
I texted back: Thank you for confirming it was you.

Seven years of bruises, one word to end them.
This time I’m not the girl who stays.
This time, he kneels—and the fire doesn’t.

Chapter 1 - Caught In The Act.

Elena's P.O.V.

Jesus please forgive me for I have not yet sinned but I plan to and worst of all, I fear that I'll enjoy sinning more than I should and I'll take great pleasure in it so that I can get revenge on those who have dared to betray me.

You see lord, I made a really stupid decision when I was just a dumbass eighteen-year-old kid and I did so because I thought that I had found the love of my life, my other half, my soul mate but I was wrong and now I plan to rectify the mistake that I made seven years ago.

I just hope that you can forgive me my dear lord and you don't hold what I have to do against me because even you know that I've been through enough with this jackass.

I've always known my husband Tristan was a first-class jerk with a bad temper from the moment I first met him, in fact, I was warned by my father and older brother Brandon to stay away from him because they knew he was bad news from the very start but my stubborn, hot-headed ass wouldn't listen to them.

Now look at me.

Looking back now, I really wish that I had listened to them, maybe if I had then I wouldn't have been forced to live through seven years of pure torture at the hands of the very man I loved and who I thought loved me.

Lately, I've been looking for a way to escape my abusive marriage but I didn't know how and this thought pissed me off more than anything because I'm a very strong woman physically and I used to be strong mentally as well but years of being abused in every possible way by Tristan has fucked me up and left me the one thing I had never been which is vulnerable.

I had tried many ways to escape this torturous life including just simply filing for divorce but this plan backfired and resulted in me receiving a broken nose and wrist as well as several broken ribs amongst other injuries after Tristan found out and attacked me.

I was starting to think that maybe there wasn't a way out for me except for death but then seven months ago, I was finally given an out thanks to the wife of one of Tristan's business associates who had sent me a text message with a picture of my cheating, scumbag husband making out with my older sister Brandy on a beach while he was supposedly away on a business trip in the Bahamas.

I already knew Tristan was cheating on me because all of the classic signs were there like a huge blinking red light which I stupidly chose to ignore.

For example, the cheap perfume on him and his clothes when he would come home from work, the lipstick on his collar, the hickeys on his body and the secretive way he was with his phone but I didn't know who his whore was until I had received this text.

That was the day I put my plan into action to not only get revenge on the two people who have caused me so much pain but also to divorce my husband and finally free myself of him.

The first thing that I did was I sent the intimate photo of Brandy and Tristan to every major news outlet in America but that didn't do much to hurt them because Tristan's team immediately put out a statement saying it was A.I. created by trolls who were jealous of me and were trying to ruin my marriage.

The next thing I did was I 'accidentally' shredded an important file of Tristan's which he needed for an important business meeting that he had been working so hard on and it would've landed him a major million-dollar deal if he had managed to secure it but because of me, he didn't.

I also may or may not have let slip to the sister of a billionaire businessman from India who he was hoping to create a partnership with that Tristan was dating a girl who did OnlyFans for a living which automatically ended their partnership.

As for Brandy, the only thing I could do to her was hit her where it truly hurts and that's her job, so I called in a favour with an old friend of mine who is the owner of a top modelling agency in L.A. who my sister was signed to and he immediately cancelled her contract upon hearing about her extra-curricular activities.

To be fair, he was already planning on cancelling her contract anyway because he was getting fed up with her and her attitude, as well as her poor work ethic.

There's also the fact that he had received numerous complaints from other models who had issued an ultimatum to him that either she goes or they do because they can't stand her.

It's nice to know that I'm not the only one.

I know you may be thinking that I'm being petty and that I should just end it with him and leave with some pride and dignity still intact but I can't because they've put me through so much hell, more so my husband than my sister and these little losses feel like huge victories for me.

I've also been working on myself and my mental, physical and emotional strength these past seven months so that I can become the old Elena again.

The Elena who was feisty and strong and who would never in a million years take shit from anyone, especially not someone like her husband or sister.

I've been going to the gym every day and I've even attended some self-defence classes to brush up on my skills which seem to have been dormant lately.

I've also been reading some self-help books which have helped me to realise my worth and that I deserve better than the life I'm living right now.

The last thing I wanted was to become one of those women who say they're going to leave and then don't, I also wanted to make sure that I was strong enough to follow through with my plans because I don't want this life anymore.

I'm done.

Anyway, I've just arrived home after meeting with my dad and my lawyer to arrange a divorce which I'm going to get this time even if it kills me.

I was heading upstairs to my bedroom so that I could pack my things when I was greeted by the sounds of loud moans coming from it which left me feeling disturbed and disgusted but also very intrigued as well because I didn't know if there were animals or two human beings having sex in there.

Between Tristan's grunting like a constipated pig in distress and Brandy's high-pitched oh yeah every five seconds like an effeminate hyena, I couldn't differentiate if the noises came from them or animals.

Not to mention, the dirty talk between these two is...well, it's questionable and it made me think of the quote by Tatianna on RuPaul's Drag Race when she said we all make choices but that was a choice.

I walked over to the door and made sure I was quiet when I opened it so that I wouldn't startle or alert old McDonald's sex-craved farm animals.

I then leaned against the doorframe with my arms crossed over my chest as I watched in disgust at the sight in front of me which made me want to vomit.

Not because of who was having sex and where they were having it but because of the position they were currently in which looked both painful and uncomfortable.

There's also the fact that it's my sister who is naked on that bed and who the hell wants to see their sibling in their birthday suit? certainly not me, I can assure you.

""You know...I never understood what Beyonce meant when she said you showed your ass and I saw the real you but now I do because you Tristan Scott Lockwood have quite literally shown your ass and I'm finally starting to see the real you, it's just a shame that I'm seven years too late to dodge the bullet but hopefully, I can one day say you were the best thing I never had""

I said with a smile instantly startling the pair who quickly scrambled off the bed to hide their nudity.

Well, Tristan did, his stupid self actually fell off the bed and landed on his bare ass while Brandy on the other hand made a very lazy attempt to hide her nudity and I could tell that the bitch was revelling in what was going on and she didn't care if she was nude or not as it happened.

She's a model and an OnlyFans 'star', not to mention, she's fucked more men than a pornstar during their entire career, so go figure being naked doesn't faze her.

""Elena baby, wh..what...what are you doing here?""

""I was in the neighbourhood, I thought I'd stop by for a chat""

I say sarcastically.

""Ellie baby, this...""

Tristan said as he pointed his finger between himself and Brandy.

""This isn't what it looks like""

Tristan says and I roll my eyes.

""Why do cheating bastards like you always say it's not what it looks like when they've been caught in the act?""

I ask with irritation in my voice.

""You're naked and she's naked, you're a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess and Brandy...well, she's always been a dirty, disgusting, sweaty mess from the moment puberty smacked her in the tits like a freight train""

I say and Brandy gasps while Tristan looks at me with a horrified and angry expression on his face.

""Not to mention, her hair looks like a rats nest, you've got scratch marks on your chest, back and ass, oh and the most obvious one is that your dick is currently wet and saluting the troops after braving the deep, dark trenches between my sister's legs...what the fuck else could it look like, Tristan? were you both playing a game of Twister?""

I ask with irritation and frustration in my voice.

""Baby, I swear, it's not...""

Tristan once again tried to plead his case but was cut off by a very frustrated and angry Brandy.

""Ignore him, Elena, it's exactly what it looks like, we were having sex right here in your marital bed""

Jesus Christ.

Someone should call the media and let them know that we've got a modern-day Albert Einstein on our hands.

I thought to myself whilst rubbing my forehead in frustration.

""Thanks for that, Brandy, I'm not sure I would've ever gotten the truth out of him without you here pointing out the obvious to me""

""You're welcome""

Brandy says with a smile as she pulls a face at Tristan who looks at her like what the fuck? and I don't blame him for feeling this way, to be honest with you.

This bitch wouldn't know what sarcasm is unless it came shaped like a dick and smacked her in the face.

""Ellie love, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for this to happen, it was a mistake""

""A mistake?""

I ask incredulously.

""A mistake is when you put salt on your cornflakes or in your morning coffee instead of sugar, Tristan, not when you repeatedly stick your cock inside of your sister in laws pussy""

""But this was a mistake, babe, I promise you...why don't I go and get dressed, so that we can go downstairs and talk, hmm?""

Translation, let's go downstairs so that I can manipulate you and make you believe my lies so that you won't try to leave me again.

""I'm just gonna go and...""

""How long?""

I cut Tristan off and he looks at me confused.

""What?""

""You heard me, Tristan""

I say while glaring at him.

""How long have you two been screwing each other behind my back?""

""N..not that long, Ellie""

Brandy says nervously as she shares a nervous look with Tristan.

""Well, how long is that then, Brandy? do you mean long as in you guys just had one long passionate night together? or is it long as in the length of your hit list of men who you've spread your legs to over the years? which one is it?""

I asked Brandy who looked at me wide-eyed like she couldn't believe I'd say something so vile and vulgar towards her.

""It's only been a few months, Elena, that's all""

Tristan said and I scoffed while rolling my eyes as Brandy's shocked expression quickly changed to a nasty glare as she sneered at my husband before looking back at me with an innocent butter wouldn't melt look on her face but her eyes gave away her true feelings and she was feeling very happy, proud and smug right now.

""He's lying to you, Elena, we've been having an affair for over two years now, in fact, we just celebrated our anniversary last month""

Wow.

""Brandy...""

Tristan said through gritted teeth but was cut off by my sister who feigned being frustrated and angry with him before softening her gaze and tone at me.

""No Tristan, she deserves to know the truth""

""You're right Brandy, I do, so tell me...when did your affair start?""

I asked them and I was confused when I saw Tristan's face pale as Brandy pretended to gulp.

I also wanted to know why they did this but knowing why my husband decided to step out on our marriage and break our vows seemed irrelevant and insignificant when Brandy said what she said next.

""After you found out your son was stillborn and you were forced to give birth to him while he was dead, you know the same day where you also found out that your chances of conceiving a child again were slim to none""

Brandy said her carefully crafted answer making sure to use the precise evil words to hit me right where it hurts but it only hurt me slightly before I felt myself growing numb to everything because I knew what she was telling me was the truth.

The reason why I know this is because the anniversary of my son's death was last month the same month as their quote-on-quote anniversary.

I've come to terms with the fact my husband is a lying, cheating scumbag and I've certainly come to terms with my sister being a nasty, attention-seeking whore but the one thing I'll never ever be able to come to terms with is my infertility, especially when someone who isn't even worthy of scraping the dog crap off the bottom of my shoe is using it to low blow me because she's an evil, vindictive bitch.

Just when I thought my sister couldn't sink any lower than she already has, the bitch then went on to say something which not only tore my heart into millions of little pieces but it also made me doubt my faith in God as well.

""It's probably a good thing that I'm currently pregnant so that the Lockwood name can continue on with this baby, isn't that right, my love?""

Brandy said with a smile as she reached for a shocked Tristan's hand.

It never ceases to amaze me how God will give people like Brandy the gift of fertility knowing full well she doesn't have a maternal bone in her body and only sees her baby as a meal ticket to money and a luxurious lifestyle while women like me, you know women who would love nothing more than to be a mom and have kids are left infertile, it's not fair.

I briefly closed my eyes and let out a slow, shaky breath to control my emotions and stop myself from crying before opening them again and looking directly at Tristan as I said five words to him which caused an array of different emotions to cross his face.

""I want a divorce, Tristan""

I said nonchalantly and he looked at me with a shocked expression before it changed to a look of pure, unadulterated rage.

""WHAT?""

He growled and that's when all hell broke loose.

Chapter 2 - True Colours.

Elena's P.O.V.

They say when you die, your entire life flashes before your eyes which is said to be a strange phenomenon known as a life review showing you everything you've experienced in life from the moment you were born to the moment you took your last breath but what does it mean if you experience this phenomenon and you live to tell the tale?.

After I had announced to Tristan and Brandy that I wanted a divorce, I left the room and headed downstairs to call my brother who I was hoping could help me find somewhere temporary to live until after my divorce is finalised but before I could even get my phone out of my pocket, I was viciously pushed to the ground by my husband who then straddled me and beat me black and blue until I eventually passed out.

I didn't come too until around twenty minutes ago and I was feeling so much pain but strangely enough, it was all physical pain, none of it was emotional or mental pain, I guess that's because I had already checked out of my marriage in that way a long time ago meaning there's nothing Tristan can do that could hurt me any more.

When I married my husband at the young and tender age of eighteen, I like many other people on the planet believed that we'd be together forever and that nothing could break us apart.

I thought our marriage could stand the test of time and that divorce was just a forbidden word that one never spoke of or thought about, kind of like the three monkeys hear no evil, speak no evil, see no evil, well, it was like that.

I thought every single day of our marriage from the day we said I do to the day we would say our final goodbye and move on to the next life together would feel exactly like it did during the early days of our relationship which was filled with so much love, passion and lust.

I thought we'd do everything we could to make each other smile and feel happy but obviously, I was wrong because now, not even seven months after Tristan and I had celebrated our seventh wedding anniversary, I was here in our bedroom which was still a fucking mess thanks to the two lovebirds and I was packing my bags with determination in my heart to leave this place for good and divorce my husband as soon as possible.

Without context, most people would think we were just going through the seven-year itch and that I should think long and hard before I make any rash decisions that are permanent because I may or may not end up regretting it but that's not the case.

I guess you could say that I've had rose-tinted glasses on for the entirety of my relationship, from the moment I first met my husband to when he asked me to be his girlfriend when we were just teenagers in high school, right up to the very moment I had received that text message from my friend which blinded me from seeing the real Tristan.

Even though subconsciously I knew who he was and the type of man he was, I still refused to see the bad in him but now my eyes are clear and are wide open and any love I had for him or that I thought I had for him is long freaking gone.

""Come on, come on, Brand, pick up the phone""

I mutter into the phone.

""Shit""

I groaned when the line went dead.

This motherfucker has always got his phone glued to his hand and the one time I need his ass, he's MIA.

I've tried calling my brother umpteen times since I woke up from being unconscious but he's not answering me for whatever reason.

I once again tried to call Brandon as I continued to pack up all of my things and make sure that I've got everything that belonged to me because when I finally leave my former marital home, I plan on leaving it for good.

""Donovan here""

Oh, thank god, he answered me.

""Brand...Brand, it's me""

""Elena? Elena baby, is that you? what's wrong? is everything ok?""

Brandon asks sounding panicked which broke the wall in me causing me to break down.

""I..I need you, Brand, I can't do this anymore, I can't stay married to Tristan any longer, I..I'm done""

""Done? what do you mean you're done, Elena? what did he do? he hasn't hurt you again, has he?""

He asked angrily and I absentmindedly touched my lower lip which has been split open and bruised thanks to my delightful husband.

""Elena?...Elena sweetheart, talk to me, tell me what's going on?""

Brandon asked me and I sniffled.

I hated crying and I hated feeling weak and vulnerable because I've always been a strong woman but even the strongest of people are allowed to have a weak moment and this was mine.

""Can you just please come to my place and get me, Brand? I'm leaving Tristan and this time it's for good, I'm not gonna tolerate his abuse any more""

Brandon is the only one who knows about the abuse my husband has put me through these past seven years but he didn't find out about it because I wanted him to, no, it was because he had walked into my room unannounced while I was getting changed and he saw a massive bruise on my back, as well as several other bruises on my abdomen.

Tristan has always been very meticulous when it comes to hitting me because he knows I'm a strong girl who can easily defend herself against anyone, so he only makes sure to hit me when he knows I'm vulnerable and he always makes sure to hit me in areas which can't be seen and can easily be covered up.

In fact, today was the first time he lost control of himself and hit me square in the face, as well as attempting to choke me out leaving marks on my face and neck.

Brandon wasn't happy when he found out about the abuse, in fact, he was apoplectic and told me that he wanted to call in some of his army buddies to teach Tristan a lesson which I stupidly put a stop to but I wouldn't this time if he gave me this option.

""What do you mean, kid? what's he done?""

""I'm done, Brand, I'm so done""

I sobbed as I sat down on my bed and ran a hand through my hair as fresh tears filled my eyes and fell down my face.

""He cheated on me, Brand...he fucking cheated on me and when I confronted him about it and told him that I wanted a divorce, he went crazy and attacked me""

""He what?""

Brandon growled causing me to flinch.

""You heard me, Brand""

I whimpered as my body shook with sobs.

""He's been cheating on me, he's been having an affair for two fucking years of our marriage and you'll never guess who the skank is who he's been screwing behind my back with""

""Who is it? is it someone we know?""

Brandon asks me and I chuckle.

""Oh yeah, it's someone we know very well, Brandon...it's Brandy""

""What? Brandy?""

Brandon asks sounding shocked.

""I'm sorry, I think I misheard you, kiddo, did you just say Brandy as in my twin sister and your older sister, that Brandy? is that who you're talking about, Elena Jade?""

""Yep""

I say as I let out a sigh and run my hand through my hair wincing as I did when my hand brushed against a painful spot.

I quickly pulled my hand away and looked down at it where I was shocked but not surprised to find some blood coating my fingers.

Well, that's new.

""I can't believe this, Ellie, I can't believe Brandy would do something like this to you""

He says and I scoff.

""Really, Brand? can you really not believe it? because I can""

I say with annoyance and anger in my tone.

""Brandy's always wanted what was mine and I knew it was only a matter of time before she eventually put the moves on Tristan, I just hoped and prayed that she'd have enough pride and dignity in her to leave him alone""

""Pride and dignity""

Brandon said with a chuckle.

""You're talking about the same girl who opened up an OnlyFans account to celebrate her twenty-fifth birthday posting naked pictures and videos of herself every day, not to mention videos of her doing sexual things to herself and others bringing shame to our family name, that girl, right?""

""Yeah, I am""

I groaned in disgust while chuckling.

""Wait, how do you know what she does on there?""

I ask with a raised eyebrow and Brandon groans.

""Some of my friends have seen her content and told me about it, one of them even showed me a video of her in a gangbang with five guys because he didn't know we were related and thought I'd like it""

Hmm, nice.

I thought to myself sarcastically.

""Anyway, it doesn't matter because I don't care anymore, Brand, the biggest asshole in the world can now be with the number one asshole flasher in the world for all I care, I just want to be free of them""

I said and Brandon chuckled but it was only briefly.

""Do you really want Brandy to be with an abusive bastard like Tristan, Elle?...I mean, don't get me wrong, sweetheart, I hate them both for what they've put you through but nobody, not even Brandy deserves to be in a relationship with a scumbag who beats women the way he does with you, kiddo""

Brandon says with concern in his voice.

""Normally I'd agree with you, Brand but to be honest with you, brother...I don't think she cares""

""Why do you say that?""

He asks sounding confused while I let out a shaky breath to once again control my emotions.

""Because she just stood there and watched as Tristan beat me, Brand""

I said as a stray tear fell down my cheek causing a stinging sensation as it landed on a cut.

""What did you just say, Elena?""

Brandon asks sounding horrified and shocked.

""You heard me, Brandon""

I said as I let out a breath.

""At first, I thought I was seeing things when I saw her standing to the side and watching with a happy glint in her eyes and a smirk on her evil face...I thought Tristan's hits were messing with my head making me see things that weren't there but no, she was there and she was revelling in it""

""That bitch""

Brandon groaned under his breath.

""Ok kiddo listen to me, go and pack your stuff and meet me out front, I'm already in Black Hawk and I'll be at your place in ten minutes""

""Ok, thank you, Brandon""

""You're welcome, Ellie Bear""

Brandon says and I smile.

We then bid each other goodbye and I finish packing my things and taking them downstairs.

I didn't have much because unlike my sister, I'm not a flashy person and I prefer to put my hard-earned money to good use which will benefit me later on instead of wasting it on something I'll barely ever use because I 'need' them or because I need and want to show them off to unimportant people so that they'll know or at least think I'm rich.

I'm also not interested in anything designer or even expensive jewellery and if there's any of that shit in my closet then it's because Tristan bought it for me, I only buy what I need and that's it.

I was in the middle of bringing the last of my things downstairs which wasn't easy considering my ribs felt like they were broken and were playing kerplunk with my insides when my soon-to-be ex-husband and my slutty sister walked in like nothing had happened.

""What the fuck is going on in here?""

""Aww, it looks like she's taking out the trash, baby""

Brandy says with a smirk earning a glare from both myself and Tristan.

""Shut the fuck up, Brandy""

Tristan growls and she flinches as I roll my eyes.

""Actually Brandy, Tristan is the one who deals with the trash around here, not me, I've got more class unlike some people who are more than happy to touch some nasty, used, washed up, disgusting, piece of shit trash, in fact, he loves it, case and point""

I say with a smirk as I pointed my finger at my sister who glares at me while Tristan looks at me with shock evident on his stupid face.

For years, everyone in town including most of my family and my husband have believed that I loved and idolised my sister and that's because I didn't want anyone to know how much I truly despised the bitch.

The reason why is because if I do show my true feelings for her then that not only gives her even more attention which she doesn't need or deserve but it also gives her a new stage to play the hard done by victim which she would've milked dry because let's face it, it's easy to sympathise with someone who's hated by a sibling, especially if we don't know the reason why.

""Babe, did you hear what she just said to...""

""Oh and Brandy""

I cut my sister off from her whining.

""If I were you, my dear sister, then I'd learn how to do this thing which is foreign to whores such as yourself and it's a little something called keeping your mouth shut because if you don't and you continue to run yours like the silly little bitch that you are then I'll have no other choice but to give you one hell of a beating, one where your plastic surgeon will have no other choice but to make you pay for your procedures this time instead of accepting an old fashioned downstairs handshake and a slurpy for payment if you catch my drift""

I say with a smirk.

""That's enough, Elena...you're out of order""

Tristan growls and my face narrows in confusion.

""I'm out of order?""

What does he think I am? a Coca Cola machine?.

I thought to myself while rolling my eyes.

""Yes, you're out of order, Elena, now apologise to your sister""

Tristan says and I chuckle.

This man has lost his mind.

""I'd rather French kiss a bulldog with herpes than lower myself to her level and apologise for telling the truth, Tristan""

I said with a sneer.

""Maybe next time you have an affair, you should try sticking your cock in someone who has actually got a backbone and has got the stones to face the wrath of her lover's wife instead of cowering behind him like a pathetic little wimp...you're an embarrassment to women everywhere, Brandy""

""Elena""

Tristan said through gritted teeth pissing me off.

""What, Tristan?...doesn't your mistress like to hear the truth? well, she should remember this day then so that she'll be reminded to keep her legs closed to married men in the future and save herself from any further embarrassment, shouldn't she?""

I sneered at Brandy who whimpered and moved closer to my husband as she feigned innocence and played the wounded victim card to gain sympathy from Tristan which she got but I could see right through her act as smugness swam deep in her eyes.

""Don't be upset with my sister, baby, Elena's got every right to be angry and upset with me, I mean, after all, I did steal her husband away from her and I ruined her life, not to mention, I've also been successful in giving you the one thing she can't""

Brandy said whilst gently caressing her stomach.

Her words were like a red flag to a bull and she was successful in provoking me and flipping my bitch switch but it was Tristan's response which shocked me even though it shouldn't have because hurting me is almost like second nature to him now.

""I know, baby, she's just jealous, that's all""

He said whilst kissing Brandy's temple and rubbing her stomach as she smirked victoriously and mouthed I win again at me.

""You evil, spiteful bitch""

I growled as I stormed over to my sister intending to beat her ass and cause her a world of pain but before I could get close to her, Tristan grabbed me by my hair and viciously threw me against the staircase causing me to bang my head against the hard marble.

I instantly became drowsy and I could feel myself losing consciousness as I heard three voices speak but it was the latter one which filled me with relief and happiness as everything turned black.

""Oh fuck...Elena baby, are you ok?""

Tristan asked sounding panicked.

""Oh my god, Tristan, what did you do?""

Brandy gasped sounding like she actually cared and was worried for me for the first time ever.

I felt a hand gently caress my cheek as a loud, angry voice boomed throughout the hallway.

""WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON IN HERE?...holy shit, Elena""

Big brother has finally arrived and he's pissed.",2,1755740337.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False

1mvxpy8,https://www.reddit.com/r/birthcontrol/comments/1mvxpy8/iud_experience_from_a_cynic/,IUD Experience - From a Cynic,"Hello Reddit!

I’ve been lurking here for years, but I’m super shy and have only ever made one post before (about losing my soul dog), which got taken down because I didn’t have enough karma. But this forum was such a haunt for me before my IUD, and I felt like it was time to give back. I lived vicariously through so many posts here that it feels like a responsibility—especially after I told my OB/GYN what horror stories I had read before coming in.

I’ve never wanted a birth control method I couldn’t “get out.” I stopped using the ring because I had a rough reaction, and most pills affected me poorly. My husband and I practiced the pull-out method for years, which worked… until my blood ferritin started acting funny in my early 30’s. I became anemic, bruised easily, had days I couldn’t even get out of bed, and sometimes lab results looked normal depending on timing. I was also bleeding heavily 15+ days at a time. After some detective work, I linked it to my menstrual cycle and went to my OB.

Context: I absolutely adore my OB. He delivered 2 of my 3 kids, trying his damnedest to respect our wishes (shoutout Dr. AT-K!) and I’ve trusted him implicitly ever since. When I went to him about my heavy bleeding, endocrinology and hematology/oncology had already cleared me and made me feel stupid for even coming in. But AT-K discussed options for regulating blood loss and basically said there was nothing non-hormonal that would help—but he mentioned the IUD as a possibility, short of having my uterus removed, which I’m not quite ready for yet.

We had a long conversation, and he patiently answered every question without the “it’s just a pinch” attitude I had seen elsewhere. His exact words were “it’s not going to be a trip to Disneyworld, I won’t lie to you; but we’re going to get through it - those horror stories you’ve heard? I know the causes and that won’t be you”. I trusted him. I did my research, asked friends, and yes, the stories online were terrifying. Many people vomit, pass out, or fail insertion. But when I sat in front of him shaking and crying, he checked on me, asked if the meds worked, and asked if I wanted to move forward—I did. He made everything about me. My husband was there, but he was a stage prop - it was all about me.

He had prescribed misoprostol to soften my cervix (I have three kids—two vaginal, one emergency C-section) and Valium for the day of. I took them as prescribed and still cried in the procedure room out of fear. My husband held my hand, and I felt… nothing.

He explained everything, including when I’d feel cramping and why. Honestly, it was a little more annoying than a PAP smear, but not much. I was shocked when it was done!

I know everyone’s experience is different, and my experience won’t necessarily be shared by everyone. Pain tolerances vary, medical histories vary, and the procedure can be difficult for some. I just wanted to offer a positive perspective because this forum helped me feel prepared and less alone, and let me know it was ok to cry, be scared, and ask questions.

The practitioner truly matters. I trusted my OB because of how he handled my deliveries and my ongoing concerns. His guidance made what I expected to be a nightmare completely manageable.

I encourage everyone to shop around. Find a provider who makes you feel valued, like your opinions matter. Someone who genuinely cares about YOU. While my experience doesn’t guarantee a painless insertion for everyone, advocating for yourself makes a difference. Even if that difference is just your comfort because of who is doing this procedure for you. I spent nights sobbing and terrified of a day that was no big deal! I laughed with my husband and my OB at the end, got a celebratory coffee on the way home, took a nap and then went back to work. Nothing I would have ever expected! 

I’ll say it again: Find your person. Find who values you and who makes you feel safe and heard.

And if you’re in North Carolina (or willing to travel) and want an OB/GYN who cares about you, hit me up—I promised him I’d say, “I got a guy for that.”",5,1755740162.0,birthcontrol,1,1.0,False

The day I turned sixteen, my childhood friend, the one who had promised to claim me as his mate the moment we both came of age, stood before the entire Griffin Pack and declared Jenna Dean as his chosen Luna. Jenna, the pretentious heiress of the Lycan Kingdom, with her golden hair and perfect smile, was everything I wasn’t. And there I stood, in the shadow of her radiance, feeling the weight of my own inadequacy. But then, Axton Griffin, the Alpha of the Griffin Pack—a man revered for his wisdom and strength—stepped forward. His towering frame, muscles rippling beneath his tailored suit, commanded the attention of everyone in the grand hall. He looked at me, his dark eyes filled with something I couldn’t quite place, and confessed his love with a grandeur that left me breathless. For five years, he treated me with a tenderness that felt almost too good to be true. His touch was gentle, his words sweet, and his devotion unwavering. I believed him. I believed in us. Until the day I overheard a conversation between him and his Beta, Emerie. “Alpha,” Emerie said, her voice low but clear, “now that Jenna’s become the Lycan Princess, do you still need to keep up the charade with Sylvia?” Axton’s response was cold, detached. “Since I can’t have Jenna, it doesn’t matter anymore. Plus, as long as I’m here, Sylvia won’t disrupt Jenna’s happiness.” The words hit me like a blow to the chest. I stumbled back, my heart pounding in my ears. My wolf whimpered in the back of my mind, a sound of pure anguish. I had been a fool. A pawn in his game to protect Jenna. I retreated to our chambers, my hands trembling as I opened the sacred texts Axton always kept by his side. Each page was inscribed with Jenna’s name, prayers and blessings meant for her, not me. “May Jenna be freed from obsession; may her soul be at peace.” “May Jenna attain all she desires, and may her love be unwavering.” ... “Jenna, though fate hasn’t united us in this life, may I hold your hand in the next.” The illusion of our marriage shattered in that instant. I couldn’t stay. I wouldn’t. I devised a plan, a false identity, and a staged disappearance. From now on, we wouldn’t have to meet again for an eternity. Once the final arrangements were set for the faked death, I hung up the phone. In two more days, I would vanish forever as they wished. At that moment, a faint scent of coffee wafted in from outside. I instinctively looked up to find Axton standing in the doorway. He crossed the room in a few strides, his presence overwhelming as always. He embraced me gently, his voice soft, “Who were you just talking to?” “Nothing important, just something about the gallery,” I replied, trying to sound casual. He kissed the top of my head and murmured, “Why so busy lately? Tonight, I’ll whip up something light for you, easy on the stomach.” Five years of marriage, and he treated me with unwavering tenderness. People say when an Alpha truly loves, it lasts a lifetime. I once thought this was my happiness. But now, I’ve realized this marriage wasn’t my happiness—it was his way of shielding Jenna. Gently stroking my shoulder, Axton suddenly mentioned, “By the way, the Deans are hosting a Thanksgiving celebration tomorrow. Jenna’s pregnant, and they’re celebrating her entry into the international art exhibition. You don’t need to go. I’ll send a gift and come back to keep you company.” “But the art exhibition, I—” He cut me off, his tone kind yet firm, “You shouldn’t participate in the exhibition. Haven’t you always said you wanted a pup? It’s a good time to rest at home.” I lowered my gaze, trying to hide the turmoil inside. We’ve been married all these years without pups. I once thought it just wasn’t the right time, but now I fear he never truly wanted them. Not letting me compete might just be his way of ensuring Jenna’s path remains clear. He pressed a tender kiss to my forehead, seemingly unaware that my heart was sinking into the abyss. “The day after tomorrow is your birthday. I’ve planned a surprise for you—a wish for eternal happiness.” Eternal happiness. I repeated the words under my breath, suddenly finding them unbearably hollow. For years, every blessing from his lips contained the word “eternal,” yet now I understood its true meaning. Those blessings were never meant for me. “Alright, I’ve planned a few things myself for my birthday. Make sure you keep your schedule open for me.” He nodded, “Of course, whatever our dear Sylvia wants.” I looked up and smiled at him. Axton Griffin, you really outdid yourself. That night, unable to sleep, I gently moved the arm he’d draped over me. As I did so, I accidentally knocked his set of prayer beads to the floor. Picking up the beads, I felt a strange texture on their surface. In the dim light, I examined them closely, only to discover each bead was inscribed with a word. Jenna. At that moment, my heart completely gave up.

Chapter 2
The next morning, I turned to Axton, my voice steady despite the storm brewing inside me. ""Let’s go visit the Griffin Pack together.""
He hesitated, his Alpha aura flickering for a moment before he regained his composure. ""Alright,"" he said, his tone measured. ""We’ll drop off our gift and head back.""
I knew why he hesitated. He was worried I’d upset Jenna, his true mate. But I didn’t care. I just wanted to see my family one last time before I disappeared. Tomorrow, I’d be gone.
When we arrived at the Griffin Pack estate, the place was alive with celebration. Guests from neighboring packs had gathered to honor Jenna’s pregnancy and her entry into an international art exhibition—two reasons for the pack to rejoice. Jenna stood at the center of it all, her golden hair catching the light, her smile radiant. She was the perfect Luna, the embodiment of grace and strength. Everyone was certain her painting would win a major award. Someone even mentioned it had been paired with a poem by Roberto Price, a Delta warrior known for his artistic flair. Together, they said, it was a masterpiece.
As I stepped into the grand hall, Jenna’s eyes flickered to me, her smile tightening for a moment before she smoothed it over. ""Oh, my sister is here?"" she said, her voice sweet but laced with sarcasm. ""You seem to have plenty of spare time lately.""
I ignored her jab, my gaze drawn to the painting on display. My heart clenched. It was one of my own works, a piece I’d completed years ago and kept hidden in my private gallery. How had it ended up here? How had it become her ""competition entry""?
Jenna watched me with a smirk, gliding closer, her voice soft but cutting. ""Do you like this painting, sister?""
I shot her a cold look, ready to retort, when she suddenly gasped, clutching her belly. Her face twisted in pain, and she staggered backward. The room erupted into chaos.
""What happened?!"" someone shouted.
""Jenna’s pregnant! How could anyone bump into her!""
""Call the healer, quick!""
Amid the commotion, I heard a voice filled with tension: ""Jenna!""
It was Axton. His concern was palpable, his Alpha aura flaring as he rushed to her side. The way he looked at her—protective, desperate—shattered the last shred of hope I’d been clinging to. When he noticed my gaze, he quickly schooled his expression, turning to me with a gentle reproach. ""Regardless, Jenna’s lost the baby. You shouldn’t have pushed her.""
Just then, news broke that the painting had advanced to the finals, with a high chance of winning the gold medal. Axton’s face lit up with pride, a look I hadn’t seen in the five years we’d been together.
I asked him quietly, ""Why does Jenna’s painting look exactly like mine?""
He hesitated, his Alpha mask slipping for a moment before he recovered. ""Maybe it’s just a coincidence,"" he said, his tone dismissive. ""Perhaps her style mirrors yours...""
I let out a cold laugh. That painting had been locked away in my private gallery, the key held only by a select few. And the poem accompanying it—even under a pseudonym—the handwriting matched Axton’s. There was no doubt who was responsible.
I had intended to give that painting to him as an anniversary gift for our fifth year. Now, it was clear even our mate bond had been a lie, rendering the painting meaningless.
I smiled faintly, my voice flat. ""Let’s take a yacht ride,"" I said. ""Sail through the night and catch tomorrow’s sunrise.""
Axton hesitated, his Alpha instincts likely sensing something was off. But he nodded, his expression softening. ""Alright,"" he said. ""Let’s go.""
As we left the estate, I could feel the weight of the pack’s eyes on me. They whispered, their voices carrying through the mind link, but I blocked them out. I had one last night to endure. Then, I’d be free.

Chapter 3
Once inside the car, Axton’s deep voice filled the space, his Alpha aura pressing against me even in his calmest moments. ""I’ve arranged a surprise for your birthday,"" he said, his tone carrying the weight of authority. ""Once we have some downtime, maybe we should think about starting a family.""
I kept my gaze fixed on the passing scenery outside the window, the city lights blurring into streaks of gold. My wolf stirred faintly in the back of my mind, a quiet whisper of unease, but I silenced her. I said nothing in return.
As the car began to move, his phone rang. The sound was sharp, cutting through the silence like a blade. He answered, his forehead wrinkling slightly, his voice carrying a note of apprehension that was rare for an Alpha.
I looked at him, my tone calm but distant. ""If you need to take care of something, you should go.""
He paused briefly, his dark eyes flickering with something I couldn’t quite place. ""Sylvia, I...""
""It’s fine,"" I said, cutting him off. ""I’ll wait for you on the yacht.""
I didn’t see the caller ID, but I knew only one person could provoke such a reaction from him. Jenna Dean. His true mate.
Once on the yacht alone, I pulled out my phone and scrolled through Jenna’s Instagram. A newly uploaded photo popped up, captioned: ""Success is sweeter with someone by your side, sharing late-night cookies and having conversations just for you. Thanks for always looking out for me.""
The comments overflowed with admiration: ""Your mate treats you so well!"" ""That’s what it means to truly pamper your Luna!""
Yet, my eyes were drawn to the hand in the photo. The wrist was adorned with a familiar silver bracelet—Axton’s. The one I’d given him on our first anniversary.
I dialed his number, only for Jenna to pick up.
""So late, what does my dear sister want by calling me? Trying to reach your Alpha, perhaps?"" Jenna’s voice was thick with sarcasm, her tone dripping with the confidence of someone who knew she’d won.
""Give it up; he’s not coming home tonight. Looks like my lovely sister can’t keep a mate. I’ve handed him over, and still, you can’t manage.""
I hung up without a word and told the yacht staff, ""Let’s set sail.""
""Aren’t we waiting for anyone else?"" one of the crew members asked, his tone respectful but curious.
Softly, I answered, ""No need to wait. It’s just me.""
The yacht glided forward, cutting through the midnight sea towards the open water. Standing alone at the bow, I stared at the stars above, the chilly wind biting at my skin as starlight danced across the waves.
He never returned that night.
I leaned against the deck, lost in thought, memories of the past five years flooding back. His kindness, his presence, his promises... every memory felt like a shard cutting through my heart, coming together to form only a broken image.
All the pretense, all the lies, seemed absurdly laughable now.
Before dawn, I dialed his number one last time. The phone was off.
Staring at the screen, I set the phone to upload the video evidence of my painting at a scheduled time. Once that was done, I moved to the stern, glancing one final time at the breaking light of dawn.
Then, I jumped, plunging into the icy depths of the sea.
Meanwhile, Axton hurriedly left Jenna’s place, his Alpha aura crackling with urgency. ""I have to go. Tomorrow’s her birthday, and I promised her we’d watch the sunrise together.""
Jenna blocked him, her voice sharp with frustration. ""Axton, I need you now...""
He shook his head, his tone firm. ""No, not today.""
Just then, his Beta, Emerie, rushed to him, her face pale. ""Alpha, your mate jumped off the yacht!""",2,1755739798.0,Novelnews,3,1.0,False
1mvxkqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Petloss/comments/1mvxkqr/i_just_lost_my_cat_to_a_teeth_removal_procedure/,I just lost my cat to a teeth removal procedure.,"I just want to start by saying it's not the vet's fault. The title of the post isn't for blaming the vet. It's just that I'm so shocked and sad that this is how we lost him.  
  
The cat's name was Mau. He was about 9-10 years old. We're not sure of his exact age because we took him in after a neighbor moved and left him behind and he seemed already grown.   
Mau was the sweetest and most docile cat I've ever had the pleasure of encountering, and for me the most beautiful too. He was pretty lazy but was always so cute in the few moments where he did play trying to catch things or ambushing the dog. He never scratched or bit me or my family with aggression, even in stressful moments like bathing or vet visits.   
  
He had to have most of his teeth removed due to a tooth infection and severe gengivitis. He had several loose teeth and had already lost a few.   
He had been eating normally until relatively recently, about a month or so. It seemed like he had been eating less during these past few weeks. But I really thought he was just being picky, as he had always been.   
We didn't notice his problem was so severe until we noticed he had really bad breath and drooled a lot.    
So we took him to the vet last Saturday. He injected him some antibiotics and prescribed that we give him oral antibiotic for 10 days.   
He told us his teeth needed cleaning and that during the procedure he'd check if there were any loose or damaged teeth to remove. We appointed the teeth cleaning for today.   
In the days between the last vet visit and today, we fed him the antibiotics like prescribed.   
The cat behaved normally for the most part and continued to eat, though not too much. I gave him soft cat food, which he never liked that much. The only soft foods he seemed to like was the ocassional tuna can or piece of meat or fish. He liked kibble the most.  
He was always lazy and slept through most of the day, but it seemed to me like lately he was sleeping a lot more. He'd still come check on me when he'd get up and seek me out to get his head and belly rubs, so it was relieving that he was still in a good mood for that. I didn't know if I was being anxious or if he really has on a decline. He had indeed lost some weight.   
My sister told me she found one of his teeth on the bed last night. It gave me a bad feeling. But I tried to not let it get to me.   
He still got up to enthusiastically ask for dinner and to drink water. I had to put away his food plate and water after that so that he could have the anesthesia today.  
I could barely sleep last night. It's not that I was imagining the worst was gonna happen to Mau, but it was general anxiety about the procedure. The vet had told me to come around noon. I grabbed the carrier bag and sought my cat. He was sleeping on my sister's bed with his belly up.   
Mau looked so cozy and content that I felt bad for waking up and taking him to the vet for such an unpleasant time, but I knew it had to be done.   
  
He of course resisted getting in the carrier bag and mewed in distress when we were reaching the Vet's clinic. I kept trying to soothe him and told myself that even without the teeth he had lost, he'd feel better and would eat better when he healed from the procedure and the infection went away. The vet did tell me about the potential risks of any procedures involving anesthesia and had me sign some forms. He did also try to assure me that it was rare and that in all of his years that had never happened to the animals he treated. I already knew of that possibility and acknowledged his advisory. He told me he'd be done before 5pm and would give me a call.

I returned home and maybe less than one hour later the vet called me to let me know that Mau's teeth were in a really bad state. That he'd have to remove most of them except for the incisors and maybe a molar. He wanted to let me know so that I wouldn't be shocked to learn that when I went to pick him up.   
Maybe less than another hour later he called again. I'm not sure. It happened so fast. This time to tell me that after he was done with the procedure and started doing cleanup, Mau's heart stopped, and he couldn't resucitate him.   
I rushed to the vet's clinic. With a serious, but sad expression on his face, the vet told me that the procedure was already done and everything, but suddenly Mau's heartrate shoot up. He tried to give him a medicine to get it under control, but his body couldn't resist and his heart stopped soon after. He unsuccessfully tried to resucitate him too. 

Now I don't know what to do. I feel so guilty. That we didn't notice he had teeth problems earlier. Or that I even took him to the vet to undergo the procedure to begin with.   
I know had to do it, but now I'm wondering if I hadn't taken him there but kept feeding him his antibiotics, if he'd still be at home sleeping cozily and at night he'd ask for dinner again and he'd come snuggle with me as usual. I don't know if I'm deluding myself due to guilt and maybe he actually was really sick and would have continued to lose weight and get weaker until he succumbed to something else. Maybe he'd have entered a state of depression from losing his teeth and go downhill regardless. Maybe he'd have recovered from his but gotten an unrelated but worse illness like cancer or organ failure later on. I just don't know.    
Seeing his food plate and water bowl after returning home broke me. He still has a whole sack of kibble I had bought recently. And litter for his litterbox too.  
  
I thought I'd have him for a few more years. That he'd have a longer life. That he'd pass away a few years after my dog who is older than him. That both pets would pass away after having given them long cozy lives, and afterwards I'd be sad, but satisfied for having taken good care of them. I just wasn't ready to lose him today. Not ready to lose him first.  
  
We took him in 2017. He belonged to a neighbor who moved and left him behind. The cat wandered the neighborhood and would sometimes lay on our front yard. When we saw him laying on our property, he was bony and frail-looking. We pitied him and left some food for him on our front yard. Soon enough, he invited himself into our house. One day I had returned from school and found the cat laying on our couch. He had entered through the window. He fled the first time. The second time he didn't and turned out to be a really docile cat. We kinda just let him stay and he'd come and go every day. He eventually became an indoor cat after we had him fixed. We did it because he often fought with other cats. After sterilization he stopped fighting other cats and became very indoorsy.   
He also went from happily eating anything we gave him to becoming a picky eater and an energetic beggar for food, like cats do. He didn't play much and to be honest I don't think he was very intelligent, but he was super affectionate and loyal.

There was this one time last year, where I felt my heartrate go very high, which I attributed for a ver strong coffee I drank a few hours earlier. I was laying down on my bed and breathing heavily, then Mau, who was laying next to me, got up and started directly into my face. His eyes wide open like he was scared. He mewed in what I identified as a disstress tone (like when we bathed him or took him to the vet). He could tell I wasn't feeling well.  
That's when I realized he was actually more perceptive than I gave him credit for. I petted him and drank some water. Not long after I started to go back to normal.  
  
As a work-from-home person since 2021, he has been there for me every single day for the last 4 years. I don't know what I'll do when winter comes and he doesn't sneak up to lay on my back while I sleep. When I get up and he doesn't follow me downstairs for breakfast every day from now on.  
  
I have tried my best to give him a safe comfortable life all these years, and I think I did. I looked through my recent pictures of him and he looks goofy or content in all of them. Yet I still feel like I killed him.  
  
I'm not sure I'm seeking words of comfort, but I really wanted to put all these feelings I'm having somewhere.   
If you took the trouble to read all of this. Thank you.  ",16,1755739746.0,Petloss,3,0.95,False
1mvxkn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1mvxkn0/dating_her_was_like_playing_a_game_where_the/,Dating her was like playing a game where the rules changed every 5 minutes,"It all started when I met my ex. In the beginning, it seemed innocent she used to invite me over to eat cake with her and her friends. It felt simple… harmless even. But over time, things started to feel… off.

One day, we had a video call. She didn’t want to turn on her camera, saying her hair was “messy.” Actually, she never wanted to show her face. Later, she told me she had autism according to her, at least.

Our conversations were mostly one-sided. I was always putting in the effort.

We planned to meet at the park once, but she canceled last minute, saying she hurt her leg. Then she started opening up about how her ex abandoned her, how she dated another guy who dumped her, and how she felt constantly rejected.

At that point, I still wanted to be there for her… until the day I got mugged and almost lost her number. She didn’t care. She acted completely indifferent and even said:

> “I won’t text you if you don’t text me.”



That was a red flag, but I ignored it.

She’d talk about her cats, her nephews who also had autism, and once she got furious because her cousin mentioned she used to drink with her ex. Her emotions flipped constantly like a switch.

Eventually, I invited her to the movies, since she always complained we never went out. At first, she said no because she was “too shy.” Then she agreed. But the next day, right before the date, she suddenly dropped:

 “Maybe we should just be friends?”


Still, we went. We met there, bought candy, kissed during the movie, spent the afternoon acting like a real couple. It felt nice  until I realized she wouldn’t let me look at her phone. She refused to give me her Instagram until after we broke up.

Another time, we went to the mall. She gave me a chocolate, and we ended up going to a motel. But the moment we got there, she said she was “too shy” and didn’t want the lights on. I said it was fine… but suddenly, she snapped and her mood flipped again.

We went to the park another day, spent some time together, and when she was heading home, I decided to walk her there. That’s when I noticed something strange she was making it obvious she didn’t want me to meet her family.

Later, her sister once drove her to my place. I made a small joke about how we never went out because she was always “making excuses.” She blew up on me that day.

We played a game together once, I criticized it lightly, and she got mad, stopped playing entirely. Then she brought me chocolate… only to ask for a breakup right after.

She invited me to a party once, then changed her mind, then said she wanted me there again. I got frustrated and asked if she even wanted me around. She said yes, but made it very clear I couldn’t arrive before 6 PM.

I showed up a bit early anyway. Her sister saw me and asked me to come upstairs. We ended up going to her friend’s party together, and there, she introduced me as her boyfriend. I thought, “Finally, some clarity.” But then, out of nowhere, she turned to me and said:

""Should we download a dating app to find you a hot girl?""


I laughed awkwardly, but deep down, I was confused as hell.

Later that night, she wanted me to sleep over. I went home instead. Things started spiraling from there.

After all the mixed signals, I eventually called her and broke up. She started crying, blocked me everywhere, then sent me a long message saying I “sent her to a mental clinic” and “stole her happiness.”

Then… a few days later, she messaged me again, saying she missed me more than she thought she would. Against my better judgment, we started talking again.

And that’s when I found her on a dating app.

When I confronted her, she claimed she was “looking for her friend’s ex.” I didn’t buy it. I got angry, but in the end… I still told her I loved her.

She said she was at a place and wished I was there. Later, she called me, inviting me to her mom’s birthday party. I didn’t go.

The next day, her mom called me personally, asking if I really loved her daughter. Then she invited me for coffee.

We talked again, but soon she told me her dad was angry at me. I vented online about everything that had been happening… and she found my post.

She accused me of using her, lying to her, and manipulating her. Then she said she only acted that way because she was insecure, had autism, and prayed for me every single day.

Then she blocked me everywhere.
And just… disappeared.


TL;DR: Met a girl who was unpredictable, constantly changing moods, hiding things, blocking me, coming back, inviting me, rejecting me, crying, gaslighting me, and blaming everything on her autism and insecurity. I tried to stay, but it destroyed me.",10,1755739738.0,BPDlovedones,1,0.86,False

1mvxh9y,https://www.reddit.com/r/navalaviation/comments/1mvxh9y/the_sinking_of_the_uss_indianapolis_the_navys/,The Sinking of the USS Indianapolis: The Navy's Worst Nightmare,"Okay, people. Take out the coffee and sit down, because today I come to tell you the story of the USS Indianapolis (CA-35). No, it's not the typical warship that everyone has heard of, but its story is, without a doubt, one of the most fucking brutal and heroic of World War II.


To put them in context: this heavy Portland-class cruiser had a top-secret mission in July 1945. The cargo? The internal components and enriched uranium core of ""Little Boy,"" the atomic bomb that would later be dropped on Hiroshima. He completed his mission in haste, from Guam to Tinian, and then headed to Leyte... without an escort.

That's where hell begins.

On July 30, a Japanese submarine, the I-58, located it and fired a salvo of six torpedoes. Two hit him squarely. The ship, damn it, sank in just 12 minutes. Of the 1,195 crew members, about 300 went with the ship to the bottom. About 900 men, with life jackets and few rafts, were left adrift in the middle of the Pacific.

And this is where the story becomes a real nightmare. They spent four days and five nights in the water.

· Dehydration and hypothermia: The daytime sun baked them alive, drinking salt water in their desperation. The nights chilled them to the bone.
· Sharks: This is not a Hollywood exaggeration. Oceanic whitetip shark attacks were constant, massive and brutal. The men heard the screams of their companions being dragged away. It is estimated that dozens, perhaps hundreds, died for them.
· Lack of rescue: It hurts to say it, but it was a monumental screw-up by the navy. S.O.S. messages They were not taken seriously and their absence was not reported. It was pure chance that a patrol plane, the PV-1 Ventura piloted by Lieutenant Chuck Gwinn, sighted them by pure luck on August 2.

The end result was devastating: of the approximately 900 who abandoned ship, only 316 were rescued alive. Many died waiting to be saved, in what became the largest naval disaster in the history of the US Navy in peacetime or war.

The story has a bittersweet ending. The captain, Charles B. McVay III, was court-martialed, basically for being a scapegoat. He was accused of not sailing in a zigzag, even though I-58's commander, Hashimoto, testified that zigzagging would not have changed anything. McVay committed suicide in 1968. It was not until 2000 that the US Congress officially exonerated him, clearing his name.

It is a story of extreme courage, catastrophic system failures, and man's most primal struggle against nature and fear. If you want to go deeper, I leave you a video that explains it like a motherfucker, with archive images and testimonies.

1mvxbpc,https://www.reddit.com/r/introvert/comments/1mvxbpc/how_would_you_handle_this_obsessive_stalker/,How would you handle this? Obsessive stalker + people always staring,"I’d like to ask for your perspective on a situation I’ve gotten into. I’m in my mid-twenties, a university student, and I also do some modeling on the side. Personality-wise, I’m half introvert, half extrovert, I enjoy socializing but I also need my own space. I don’t always feel like dressing up just to grab groceries or a coffee, and that should be okay i think...

So here’s what happened: there’s a guy in my city, kind of popular, who started obsessing over me through social media. After about a year and a half of chatting online, we finally met. The meeting was okay, nothing special. He was nervous, but honestly a bit cuter than I expected. Later, we went on a second date, but he took me to a very lame pub where the only thing I could order was beer. He kept joking about it, but I didn’t find it funny at all, actually, I felt disrespected, especially since I had dressed up, done my hair, and put on makeup.

Not long after that, the red flags started to show. He turned out to be a real-life stalker. He somehow knew where I lived, not only my old apartment but even my second one, with the exact address. I’ve since moved again (to my third place), but I’m still in the same area.

I also heard that he talks about me a lot to his friends, and whenever I go to my favorite coffee shop, I often run into those people. The way they stare at me feels offensive, like I’m under a spotlight. I’m not a celebrity, I just want to live normally so its really annoying. I don’t always dress up or do my hair for a quick coffee or a walk, but I feel like I’m constantly being observed. It’s exhausting and makes me feel paranoid.

I like simple things, sometimes I’ll wear the same shirt three times in a week for a walk, but every time I pass that coffee shop, the conversations stop and everyone just stares. I eventually cut off communication with the guy because his behavior felt creepy and unnatural. 

I’m also working on myself, trying to heal from past trauma, but it feels impossible to do that when I’m always on “standby mode,” like I have to be ready for a catwalk just to step outside. What I really want is to heal in peace and for that guy (and his friends) to leave me alone.

I know this might sound like I’m exaggerating, but  the fact that after only two dates he already knew so much about me (because of his stalking) even my sister adress, really disturbs me.

How do you think I could deal with this? 

Thank you for your thoughts!

I’m a self-proclaimed whistling champ, a video game fiend, and a hobby enthusiast who jumps into new passions thanks to my ADHD. A good laugh and some sharp witty banter are totally my thing.
I’m all about real connections, whether that’s teaming up for some games, trying a random new hobby, or meeting your dog.

If you’re into learning something new, swapping stories, or grabbing a coffee in the city, shoot me a DM.

We have a rescued Pyrenees mix who is a total sweetheart. He gets along with everybody and doesn’t have an aggressive bone in his body, but he is generally very anxious about anything that seems to him like being cornered or trapped, loud noises, and anything unfamiliar or unexpected. He’s come a long way in the last two years from being totally shut down and hiding in corners, but we also accept that he’s now probably 12 and will likely be quirky and goofy forever, which is fine! He’s an incredibly good dog and we love him as he is. That said, this year he hasn’t shed his undercoat very well. It isn’t matted, but it’s quite thick and I imagine he’s hot. I’d love to be able to give him a husky style de-shed bath and blow out, but again, this is a dog who took a full year to get his mind around running water and put a paw in the creek for the first time and won’t come up to the couch on the side that puts him between a coffee table and the wall even when steak is on offer, so I suspect that would be… not worth it, to say the least. He is not a fan of a slicker brush but does okay with an equigroomer or plucking the tufts off by hand as long as it’s outside and he can bail if he wants to. Are there any other brush types or strategies you’d recommend? ",2,1755738367.0,grooming,5,1.0,False

My husband and I are planning a 4-day/4-night trip to Costa Rica in November with our baby (she’ll be 7 months old). We’ll be flying about 4 hours into San José and then making the ~3-hour drive to La Fortuna, where we plan to stay. I’d love advice from anyone who’s done something similar with an infant!

We’re hoping to do the flight and drive in the same day (with a hired driver). Any tips for making this as smooth as possible with a baby?

Can anyone recommend reliable car services that provide infant car seats? We can bring ours if needed, but would prefer not to.

What activities in the La Fortuna area are realistic with a baby? We’re not extreme adventurers—more into coffee, easy hikes/walks, wellness, and maybe a little mixology.

Anything you wish you had packed (or left at home) when traveling internationally with a baby?

Thanks in advance for any recommendations!",1,1755738319.0,Travelwithkids,4,1.0,False

They met at a company event where they both got invited to go watch an exclusive screening of a movie. My husband told me about her afterwards, letting me know she was really cool and how he showed her photos of us (my son and I) to which she thought we were a cute family. 

Fast forward, a month goes by and I had heard of this coworker a few more times here and there. My husband would mention her name while telling me random happenings at work. I didn’t think much of it. 

A few days ago, I noticed he started being jumpy with his phone around me. Immediately I got some intuition that something was up. I tried to ignore it but eventually couldn’t anymore so I went through his phone while he was sleeping. 

I found that he had been meeting up with this coworker for lunch and coffee way more frequently than he let on. He did not mention to me at all when he would meet with her. I also found that he deleted some messages that he had sent her and that she had sent him. Deleted messages: she basically sent him a picture of her nails after she got them done and he deleted some messages asking her to go to lunch and that they’ll order “whatever you want”.  I also saw that he deleted a picture that he took of her while they were at lunch where she had her hands raised up to block the camera and she was smiling. It was a Live Photo, when I played it they were laughing. On top of that, I asked him what he did for lunch that day and he didn’t tell me he went to lunch with her, he said that there was food at the branch. 

I confronted him that same night because I was pisseedddddd and seeing red and made him open his work chat so I could go through it where I found out that she had basically messaged him after there first initial meeting and they continued to chat after. They met up multiple times in the last month for coffee and lunch where they shared things about their past with each other. She called my husband her therapist and her bestie. He also talked to her about problems at home (not with me, with his family). He also talked to her about her dating life and how this guy at work likes her. He was the one who asked to chat with her on the phone and they also frequently called each other as well.

When I confronted him he basically said that there is nothing there and that she is just now a REALLY good friend maybe even a potential best friend. He said he deleted the messages because he thought I would take them the wrong way. I thought we were clear with our boundaries but he says he was being selfish because he felt like he had a good friend. He says he loves me and will stop talking to her for me but I kind of feel like I got micro cheated on because the way they talked to each other seemed flirty af. 

Also where would this have gone if I hadn’t found out??? What’s worse is that I have been asking him to take me out for so long and we never do? He says it’s because he’s bad at initiating but clearly he initiated hang outs with this girl so I’m confused. I also looked her up and I don’t know if he’s attracted to her, I feel like I look better but I’m also very confident in how I look and what I have to offer overall so I don’t know if I’m overreacting to this whole situation.
