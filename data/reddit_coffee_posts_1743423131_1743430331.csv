Yesterday, he sat on my laptop during a Zoom call, stared straight into the camera, and meowed like he was running the meeting. My boss just laughed and said, “Looks like we’ve got a new team lead.” Now he’s sprawled across my desk, pawing at my coffee mug like it’s his rent payment. Anyone else’s pet staging a takeover?

1jo42xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Episode/comments/1jo42xi/the_selective_outrage_of_dark_romance_readers/,The selective outrage of dark romance readers,"You ever notice how certain readers scream about wanting *dark* stories, but the moment an author actually delivers, they start clutching their pearls like they just walked into a crime scene? Like, they’ll devour books where the male lead is a literal stalker, murderer, or an HR department’s worst nightmare—but it’s fine because *he’s hot and brooding*. But the second a story portrays these things *realistically*, with actual consequences and zero romantic glow-up, suddenly it’s ""too much,"" ""problematic,"" or ""glorifying bad behavior.""

Let’s be real—what they *actually* want is a carefully curated, fantasy-friendly version of toxicity. They want the mafia boyfriend who commits war crimes *but* remembers their coffee order. The billionaire CEO who emotionally destroys people *but* buys them a designer dress afterward. They want *pick-and-choose darkness*, the kind that lets them swoon over deeply unhinged behavior while pretending it’s just ""bad boy energy"" instead of something that would get them a lifetime restraining order.

But the moment an author writes a story that actually explores the *ugly* reality of these things—without the Instagram filter and swoon-worthy ""but he loves me"" excuse—it’s suddenly *crossing a line*. The cognitive dissonance is wild. If your idea of a ""dark romance"" is a psychopath in a tuxedo who somehow avoids jail time *because plot armor*, maybe you don’t actually like dark stories. You just like *romanticizing red flags*.

And that’s fine. Just don’t turn around and act morally superior when someone writes *actual* darkness instead of an Episode fever dream.

It's perfectly fine if you seek escapism and prefer stories that help you avoid reality rather than those that provide a reality check, spread awareness, or address harsh topics seriously. Fortunately, there are hundreds of writers on Episode and millions more worldwide. Not everyone has to like or dislike the same book.

* Doing one thing at a time
* Taking walks without my phone
* Thinking before reacting
* Noticing my thoughts instead of being run by them

That shift became the basis for my newsletter called **Mind Unhurried**.

* Morning Glory/Moon Flower: is overgrowing and overspreading a concern even with our harsh winter? How to minimise this. Can they be grown indoor?
* Mint and Shiso: I often read that these are even worst invasive plant than morning glory/moon flower, as they take over your neighbourhood very quickly after a year or two, even despite of our cold winter. How bad is this? Are they truly indoor only plants in Quebec?
* Basil: no concern or worries, just excited to get some basil, Thai basil is getting really expensive and harder to find, and I've never seen purple or holy basil in the grocery store.
* Pest control: Do you plant anything for pest control? All I know is French Marigold as nematode repellent. Chive, garlic and green onion for general pest repellent. And coffee ground along the edges of plot as snail repellent.

Its quite a good concept as far as I can tell. It's empowering the reviewers, and I presume gives them earning power when someone books via their review. Not sure at all about the whole UX, seems its needs more tweeking. Clunky.

But you can sort of understand how a bad hotel review like Bvlgari goes against the whole points of the site. Thats the downside I guess. Reviews on the site are kind of incentivesed to be positive, if theres commisions to be earnt from them.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In today’s fast-paced world, many of us feel overwhelmed by stress and fatigue. Finding natural ways to boost our energy and improve our overall well-being has become a priority. One solution gaining popularity is the use of adaptogens. These natural substances are known for their ability to help the body adapt to stress and promote balance. Understanding adaptogens and how they work can be a vital part of enhancing your natural wellness journey.

Adaptogens are typically derived from plants and fungi, and they have been used in traditional medicine for centuries—particularly in Ayurvedic and Chinese practices. What makes adaptogens unique is their ability to improve the body’s response to stress, thus supporting both physical and mental health.

- **Increased Energy:** They can provide a natural boost in energy levels without the jittery side effects associated with caffeine.
- **Improved Focus:** Certain adaptogens enhance cognitive function, making it easier to concentrate on tasks.
- **Better Sleep:** Some adaptogens promote relaxation and improve sleep quality, which is essential for overall wellness.
- **Enhanced Immunity:** Regular use of adaptogens can help strengthen the immune system, making your body more resilient against illness.

You might be wondering how to get started with adaptogens. them into your routine is straightforward. Here are some simple ways:

- **Teas:** Many adaptogens like ashwagandha and holy basil can be brewed into herbal teas, making them a soothing addition to your day.
- **Powders:** Consider adding powdered forms of adaptogens such as maca or rhodiola to smoothies or oatmeal for an easy nutrient boost.
- **Capsules:** If you prefer, you can find adaptogen supplements in capsule form for convenient consumption.
- **Tinctures:** Liquid extracts can be added to water or juices, providing a quick way to absorb their benefits.

When choosing adaptogens, it's crucial to consider their specific benefits. Here are a few popular adaptogens to explore:

- **Ashwagandha:** Known for its stress-relieving properties, it helps balance cortisol levels.
- **Rhodiola Rosea:** This adaptogen is great for increasing energy and reducing fatigue, especially during mental tasks.

- **Start Slowly:** Begin with a small dose to see how your body responds. Gradually increase as needed.

Nootropics Explained: Enhancing Cognitive Function through Natural Supplements
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have you ever wished you could boost your brainpower? Nootropics are here to help! These natural supplements claim to enhance cognitive functions like memory, focus, and creativity. Knowing how to use them can be a game-changer, especially for those seeking a natural boost.

### What are Nootropics?

Nootropics, often called ""smart drugs,"" are substances that may improve brain performance. They can be synthetic or natural. Many people are turning to natural nootropics because they tend to have fewer side effects compared to pharmaceutical options.

### Popular Natural Nootropics

Several natural options are available if you're looking to explore nootropics. Here are a few of the most popular:

- **Rhodiola Rosea:** This herb is known for reducing fatigue and enhancing mental clarity.
- **Bacopa Monnieri:** Often used in traditional medicine, Bacopa can enhance memory and overall cognitive function.
- **Ginkgo Biloba:** This ancient plant can improve blood flow to the brain, which may help with memory and cognitive awareness.
- **L-Theanine:** Found in green tea, L-Theanine promotes relaxation without drowsiness and can improve focus.
- **Caffeine:** While often consumed in coffee or tea, caffeine boosts energy and concentration levels.

### How Do Nootropics Work?

Nootropics work by modulating neurotransmitters, increasing blood flow, or reducing oxidative stress in the brain. These actions can lead to improved mental performance. For instance, when you take a nootropic, it might increase your ability to concentrate, help you think faster, or support memory retention.

### The Benefits of Nootropics

Many people turn to nootropics for various reasons. Here are some benefits that might interest you:

- **Increased Focus:** Many users report improved concentration and sustained attention when using nootropics.
- **Better Memory:** Some natural nootropics may support memory formation and recall, making it easier to learn new information.
- **Enhanced Mood:** A clearer mind can lead to a better mood and a reduced feeling of stress.
- **Improved Creativity:** Certain nootropics can foster creative thinking and problem-solving.

### Safety and Considerations

Even though nootropics are natural, it's crucial to treat them with respect. Always start with a low dose and see how your body reacts. Consider the following tips:

- **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** It’s always best to get advice from a professional before starting any new supplement.
- **Research Quality Brands:** Not all nootropic supplements are created equally. Look for reputable brands that provide transparency in their sourcing and ingredients.
- **Monitor Your Body's Response:** Everyone reacts differently to supplements. Pay attention to how you feel and adjust your intake accordingly.

### Starting Your Nootropic Journey

If you’re new to nootropics, begin with a single supplement rather than a blend. This way, you can assess your body’s response without confusion. Once you know how one affects you, it’s easier to introduce others over time.

A good starting point might be L-Theanine combined with caffeine. This combo is popular for boosting focus and energy without the jitters sometimes associated with caffeine alone.

### In Summary

Nootropics offer an exciting way to enhance cognitive function naturally. With the appropriate care and attention, you could find the right nootropic to support your brainpower. Remember that while these supplements can be beneficial, they are just one piece of a holistic approach to wellness. Pairing them with a healthy lifestyle, proper nutrition, and regular exercise can help optimize your cognitive potential.

### Conclusion

Embracing natural wellness is an enriching journey, and understanding the roles of adaptogens and nootropics can significantly enhance your life. Adaptogens, such as ashwagandha and rhodiola, help your body respond to stress and restore balance, making daily challenges easier to navigate. By integrating these powerful herbs into your routine, you can cultivate resilience, boost your mood, and improve overall well-being. With their capacity to stabilize energy levels and support the immune system, adaptogens can be a vital ally in your quest for better health.

Morning routines. Productivity hacks. Always onto the next thing.

Even when it worked, I didn’t feel great. I felt rushed, distracted, and a little disconnected—from people, from the work, from myself.

So I started *slowing down on purpose*.  
Not in a spiritual, overly-serious way—just in a “pay better attention” kind of way.

Things changed when I started:

* Doing one thing at a time
* Taking walks without my phone
* Thinking before reacting
* Noticing my thoughts instead of being run by them

That shift became the basis for a little newsletter I write called **Mind Unhurried**.

Each week I share a quick note about something I’ve been thinking through—usually around simplicity, perspective, creativity, or living at a slower, more intentional pace.

Side Two:

\[Clicking noise. Tape starts.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is early in the morning on May 4^(th) of 2027. I am happy to report that one of our isolation rooms was converted into a treatment area over night. The lack of windows and low traffic in the corridors will help to keep the subject focused on the missing memories, rather than outside stimuli. The subject requested breakfast which was brought to his room. The sooner he eats, the sooner we can begin the procedure. The machine is ready, and I will be recording the session as promised.

I should go get prepared myself.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes. When the man speaks, there is an obvious echo.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 4^(th) of 2027. I am in the Control Center, making my last checks on the machine before we plug it into Mister Carmody's port. All systems are stable and functioning normally, and the subject's vital signs seem to be stable as well.

\[A door can be heard opening and closing, and then the footsteps of the man carrying the recording device. Another door opens and closes.\]

Benton: Can you hear me, Mister Carmody?

Carmody: \[His voice is distant and slurred.\] Yes. I hear you.

Benton: We're getting ready to begin. Are you ready?

Carmody: Yes.

Benton: I am going to stop recording just a moment, while we make some last minute preparations.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton, it is still May 4^(th) of 2027, and we are ready to begin the Emergent Hypnosis Process. The subject has been in a slight drug-induced hypnotic state for most of the morning. His vitals and the machine remain stable. Also attending is my intern. State your name for the record please?

Female Voice: Camille Espinoza. I am a Neurosurgery student at Oregon State University. I have been observing the process over the last few weeks and am excited to be a part of it.

Benton: That's good enough, I think we can begin if you'll be so kind as to attach the machine to the subject's port to the machine for me. Mister Carmody, you might feel some pressure at the base of your skull and see a flash of colors, and might even hear some sounds. Just relax, and try not focus on the flash. Do you understand?

Carmody: \[Still sounding distant and dazed.\] Yes, I understand.

\[A soft click and the sound of something cycling up can be heard.\]

Espinoza: All systems green here.

Benton: Here as well. Initiate.

\[There is a burst of interference of some kind.\]

Benton: Can you hear me, Jack?

Carmody: Yes. I hear you.

Benton: I need you to think about the oil rig. The hole where you were drilling. Let me know when you can see it.

\[There is a moment of hesitation.\]

Carmody: \[Monotone.\] I am trying. I can see the drill, and the wall holding back the water, but the hole is missing.

Benton: Focus, Jack.

Espinoza: His blood pressure is rising.

Benton: Activate the pump on the implant.

Espinoza: Initializing. \[A heartbeat passes.\] Pump started.

Benton: relax, Jack. Focus on the drill. The smooth metal, the twisting design on the bit.

Carmody: The bit is damaged. Melted. The grooves are gone. It shouldn't have gotten that hot if it was cutting through rock.

Benton: Can you see Quentin?

Espinoza: His heartrate just jumped.

Carmody: Yes, I see him.

Benton: What is he doing?

Carmody: Nothing. He's staring at the drill. He seems just as confused as I feel. He is shouting about a replacement, barking orders at the others.

Benton: Where is he standing in the room? Is he near the hole? I need you to tell me everything that you see.

Espinoza: Sir, his vitals are spiking and the pump is on a down cycle. We may want to take a break.

Benton: Jack. Can you hear me?

Carmody: Yes. I hear you.

Benton: I need you to remember where you are right now. In a room at Violet Hills. Do you remember coming here from jail?

\[There is a long moment of silence.\]

Carmody: I remember. Your name is Warren Benton.

Espinoza: He's stabilizing.

Benton: That's right, I'm Doctor Benton. Just relax. Close your eyes while we disconnect the machine. Miss Espinoza, deactivate his implant and remove the jack please?

Espinoza: Beginning shutdown procedure.

Benton: When that is done, move the subject to the sensory deprivation tank, please? I'm calling this an end to Session one, we will try again tomorrow.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is early afternoon on May 4^(th) of 2027. I have reviewed part of the data that the machine has compiled, but not enough to draw any conclusions about what is affecting the memory center of his brain. The subject does seem to be handling the procedure well both mentally and physically. He was able to access a memory that he could not recall upon his arrest or arrival here at Violet Hills, but only a fragment of it. The progress *is* encouraging. Subject is currently under observation and resting comfortably.

I am on my way to join the observation detail myself, and will resume recording tomorrow during Session Two.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape Resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Carmody. It is May 5^(th) of 2027. I am here with Jack Carmody and my intern Camille Espinoza. The subject and treatment room have been prepared and the Emergent Hypnosis room is initialized and stable as are the vital signs of the subject. Miss Espinoza, can you please plug the machine into the port and activate it please?

\[There is a burst of interference and then the sound of something cycling up, and then a soft, low-pitched tone.\]

Benton: Once again Mister Carmody. Just relax.

Espinoza: Initializing pump now.

\[There are a few moments of quiet, and then a scream.\]

Carmody: Make it stop. No more. Make it stop.

Benton: Jack, can you hear my voice?

Carmody: Make it stop. Please. No.

Espinoza: Shutting down. His heart rate and adrenal responses are off the charts.

Benton: Administer the sedative and return the subject to the isolation tank. Session Two is a total failure.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is late afternoon on May 5^(th) of 2027. I am in the security office, observing the feed to the subject's room. He has been hysterical except when in the sensory deprivation tank or heavily sedated. He is unresponsive to people and keeps repeating the same things he was saying during the procedure. I am hoping his condition improves within the next day, otherwise this could be a huge set-back to the Emergent Hypnosis process. It could send me back to the testing stages if he doesn't recover fully.

While that would not be ideal, I am optimistic that this procedure can and will work as I intend. Mister Carmody's first session was practically flawless and proved that this technique can work under ideal conditions. I hope to have collected good data on the error so that it can be avoided on the next attempt, even if that is with another subject.

\[There is a knock on the door in the background. Tape abruptly cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. Subject is awake and calm. He seem to be coherent, and I don't think the procedure caused any physical damage to him, but we are running tests to be sure. Espinoza is examining the CT scans and I have his bloodwork reports on my desk. I have not reviewed the results, but I do not expect to find anything. I believe that whatever is obscuring his memories is purely mental. A result of his mind trying to protect itself from the horrific actions that he performed. I am going to attempt an interview before I leave tonight.

It is my hope that this was just a minor bump in the road, and that we will be able to continue the procedure. I am not ordering the removal of the port just yet. I have this feeling that we are so very close to a breakthrough. I will not record the interview, but will update afterward to give my impressions.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape Resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is late in the evening on May 5^(th) of 2027. I have reviewed the information from our failed session. I also completed my interview with Jack Carmody. He seems to have fully recovered emotionally. There was no physical damage to his brain or spinal cord. He seems to be in good spirits, and that gives me hope that I will be able to resume the procedure on the 8^(th). I will update with a status update tomorrow.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape Resumes. The man's voice sounds tired, and slightly agitated when he speaks.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 6^(th) of 2027. I was just on a call with the Director of Violet Hills, and from the tone of our conversation, I get the feeling that he is trying to shut down the Emergent Hypnosis program. I have not yet seen Jack Carmody, but plan to interview him again after breakfast. I am also going to have him do some cognitive testing this afternoon, just to confirm that he was not harmed by the failed attempt at the process. The more evidence I have, the better my chances of keeping this project above water are.

If the plug gets pulled, I am going to feel terrible for Espinoza. Her talents would be wasted in simple neurosurgery. Her designs and programming prowess were instrumental in making the implant a stable product, as opposed to the barely functional prototype that I built and programmed myself. Her input on the machine itself was also invaluable. I will update again with a new interview with the subject.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. I am with Camille Espinoza, who is here to observe, and Jack Carmody in the subject's room. Is it okay for me to ask you some questions, Mister Carmody?

Carmody: Yes. Of course.

\[The man sounds far more sober and cogent than during the procedures.\]

Benton: How are you feeling?

Carmody: A little bit tired, and bored. Otherwise, I feel fine.

Benton: No feelings of anxiety or anger at all?

Carmody: Not currently, no.

Benton: What about this morning, or in the middle of the night last night? You've felt normal, I'm assuming.

Carmody: That's correct.

Benton: That's good to hear. How is your appetite?

Carmody: Normal. I've been eating.

Benton: Any strange thoughts or memories?

Carmody: No.

Benton: Good. Strange cravings for food?

Carmody: None.

Benton: Are all of your bodily functions normal?

Carmody: \[Clearly uncomfortable.\] Yes.

Benton: That is also good news. I think that's all the questions I have for now.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is early afternoon on May 6^(th) of 2027. As can be heard, the interview with the subject went well, and he seems in a good place emotionally and cognitively, which is encouraging. I have a call with the Director later this afternoon, and hope that I can get a meeting by the end of the week. I am forging ahead with plans to continue the procedure, as we have not been told directly to shut down. I will update after the call.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is the evening of May 6^(th) of 2027. I just got off of the phone with the Director and while it was a rather chilly affair, he agreed to allow the project to continue. I will update again on the 8^(th), barring something significant happening.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 8^(th) of 2027. I am here slightly earlier than I need to be. I could barely sleep last night because of anxiety and excitement with the continuation of the project. The subject is still sleeping, but has continued to be stable. Diagnostic testing on the port is the first thing on the agenda, but that can wait until after breakfast when Espinoza arrives. I might go down to the cafeteria myself in a moment as I haven't had anything but coffee. I will update again when we attempt session three.

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is May 8^(th) of 2027. The subject is still undergoing diagnostics on his implant, with Miss Espinoza handling that task directly. I have just finished the self-diagnostic on the machine, and everything came back well within parameters.

\[The sound of a door opening and closing can be heard.\]

Espinoza: The port is active and functioning normally, doctor.

Benton: Very good. Have the subject dosed and transported.

Espinoza: Right away.

\[The door opens and closes again.\]

\[Tape cuts.\]

\[Tape resumes.\]

This is Doctor Warren Benton. It is still May 8^(th) of 2027. Miss Espinoza is standing by. The subject is comfortably seated in the room where we have been performing the previous sessions. We are waiting for the hypnotics to take effect.

Miss Espinoza, can you run another check on the implant, please?

Espinoza: Yes, Doctor.

\[There is a pause, but movement and a soft beeping and series of melodic beeps can be heard in the nearly silent background.\]

Espinoza: Everything is in order, doctor. Implant active and functioning as intended.

Benton: Good. Now when the drugs take effect, we can begin our session.

I may have to take a little bit of a break to get a coffee and to retrieve another tape from my office as this one looks to be getting a little bit low. I want to do something a little different to end this log. I want to state for the record my hope that this session is more successful than the last, and that we make some actual progress.

Miss Espinoza, do you have anything you would like to add?

Espinoza: I would echo your sentiments, basically. I do see the potential in this procedure, or I wouldn't have devoted so much of my time to it. I hope we can use this process to help Mister Carmody and many other people lead better lives.

Benton: What about you, Jack, do you have anything you would like to say before we begin?

Carmody: I hope the same thing that I did in the beginning. I hope to uncover what actually happened that day on the oil rig, whether I actually did the things I have been accused of and have had dreams about.

Benton: Thank you, both of you for your participation. I don't know if I have said that before now, but I mean it. I will try to be more mindful in the future. This seems like a good ending point for tape one of our progress log.

Now at work, production is rolling and my part of the job is fired up and rockin' and rollin', man.  It's a nice, sunny morning, I have my travel mug of coffee, and after things have been running an hour, it's time for my usual breakfast of a PB&J.   

The PB&J that is most likely sitting in its baggie on the kitchen counter, as it isn't in my lunch cooler.   

I take a sip of my caramel macchiato sweetened java and consider my options.   I have food, of course.   My lunch is leftover fried chicken and beans & rice.  Though a perfectly acceptable fuel, it's not giving me the ""morning sweet"" vibe to which I usually look forward, so it's off to the vending machines.   

I walk to the next building and size up my choices among the 6 machines; three for drinks, two for snacks, and one for cold sandwiches and the like.   I see a ""Texas Sized Cinnamon Bun"" that looks like it will do the trick.  I wave my phone in front of the panel, punch the appropriate buttons, and watch as the motor spins the coils holding the snack, pushing it toward the drop.   

It doesn't drop.   

The coils have stopped, the bun hanging over the precipice, the machine teasing me, taunting me.  It's right there, waiting for a hundredth of a percent increase in gravity to pull it down.  I quickly calculate the appropriate distance it must travel, the distance required of the one behind it, weight of said items, and decide it is worth it to purchase another and have both.  Another phone wave, another NFC transaction, and the coils begin to turn again.   

The buns do not move.   The dangling pastry has now blocked any and all subsequent buns from being delivered.    I fume for a moment, considering getting my tools and acquiring the treats forcefully, when I notice the sticker on the machine.   ""Questions?  Comments?  Contact us at..."" it says.  I decide I will contact them.   

The QR code takes me to a website where I must fill out a form to get a refund.  Getting to the refund step asks me for my Venmo.   I don't have a Venmo.  I've never needed a Venmo.  Now I have to create a Venmo account to get a refund of $4.20.

Mushroom-infused functional beverages are becoming an exciting trend in the health and wellness community. These drinks not only taste great but also pack a nutritional punch. By harnessing the power of various mushrooms, these beverages provide benefits that can enhance your overall well-being.

You might wonder what exactly makes mushrooms such a valuable ingredient. Different types of mushrooms, like reishi, lion’s mane, and chaga, each come with their own set of unique properties. Here’s a closer look at the various benefits you can expect from consuming mushroom-infused drinks:

* **Boosted Immune System:** Many mushrooms are rich in antioxidants and beta-glucans, which can help strengthen your immune system. Regularly consuming these beverages may keep you healthier and more resilient to illnesses.
* **Enhanced Brain Function:** Lion’s mane mushrooms have been studied for their potential neuroprotective effects. They may help improve memory and cognitive functions, making them a great addition to your daily routine for mental clarity.
* **Stress Relief:** Adaptogenic mushrooms like reishi can aid in stress management. They help your body adapt to stress and can promote mental calmness, which is essential in our fast-paced world.
* **Improved Digestion:** Some functional beverages use mushrooms that contain prebiotic fibers. These fibers support gut health and can improve digestion, making you feel better from the inside out.
* **Natural Energy Booster:** Instead of reaching for another cup of coffee, consider a mushroom-infused drink. Certain mushrooms can offer a more stable and sustained energy boost without the jitters that caffeine can sometimes provoke.

When you think of mushroom drinks, you might picture something earthy or unappealing. However, modern innovations have turned these functional beverages into delicious options that you’ll actually look forward to. Many brands blend mushrooms with natural flavors like berries, herbs, and spices. This means you can enjoy the health benefits without sacrificing taste.

Choosing the right mushroom-infused functional beverage is key. Start by looking for high-quality products that highlight their mushroom content. Here are a few tips to help you pick the best option:

1. **Check the Ingredients:** Look for beverages that list specific types of mushrooms on their labels. Quality products typically highlight their key ingredients and the benefits associated with them.
2. **Consider Sugar Content:** Some drinks may contain added sugars or artificial sweeteners. Opt for those that are naturally sweetened or have little to no sugar to maximize health benefits.
3. **Research the Brand:** Look for reputable brands with positive reviews. Check if they provide transparency regarding their sourcing and processing methods.

If you’re new to mushroom-infused drinks, start small. Try a few different varieties to find out which flavors and benefits resonate with you. As with any new health trend, it's important to listen to your body and see how it reacts. Know that the effects may not be immediate, and regular consumption is often necessary to notice lasting benefits.

Mushroom-infused beverages into your routine can be as easy as swapping out your daily coffee or soda. Enjoy them in the morning, as a midday pick-me-up, or even in the evening to wind down. The versatility of these drinks makes them suitable for any time of day.

It gave me the infamous click every time you turned the key. Surely it couldn’t be the brand new starter I had put in a month earlier? Went and replaced it right in the gas station parking lot, hopped up in the cab and NOTHIN. At this point I started getting frustrated. I had a buddy tow it back to my place where I replaced the battery, alternator, and all the fuses. My one old coworker gave me the idea that it may be a corroded ground somewhere and to run a jumper cable from negative on the solenoid to bare metal and it did nothing. But then I thought maybe if I ran it straight from battery to the starter side of solenoid maybe that would work. Fired right up. So there i was, I ran a wire from solenoid side of starter into my engine bay and whenever I want to start my truck I set the wire on the positive of battery and turn the Kay and she starts right up.

That slow, heavy burn against her skin—lingering, hesitant, but undeniably there. It happened in stolen moments, when she was turned away, when she wasn’t supposed to notice. But she did.

She always did.

Jake was careful, quiet. He never let his attention linger too long when their eyes could meet. He never said anything that could give him away. And yet, the way he looked at her in secret told Elena everything.

At first, it was a curiosity, a simple amusement. A young man’s misplaced attraction, nothing more. She was married to Michael, his older brother. Surely, this was nothing but a fleeting infatuation, an accident of proximity.

But then, she realized something.

She liked it.

The idea of being seen. Of being wanted—not openly, not boldly, but in secret. It was intoxicating in a way she hadn’t expected.

So, she played along.

**The Game Begins**

She never confronted him. Never said anything that could ruin the delicate tension between them. Instead, she made sure he felt her.

Subtly. Softly. Deliberately.

She moved differently now—just a little slower, just a little more aware. When she stretched in the morning, arching her back, arms raised high above her head, she held the pose for a second longer, letting her shirt ride up, exposing a sliver of her stomach.

When she sat across from him at dinner, she crossed her legs slowly, languidly, feeling the hem of her dress slide an inch higher. She traced the rim of her glass with the tip of her finger, lazily, absentmindedly. But it wasn’t absentminded at all.

She knew exactly what she was doing.

Jake never looked directly. But she saw the way his jaw tensed, the way his fingers tightened around his fork.

Michael, oblivious, carried on as usual.

But Jake? He was unraveling, one stolen glance at a time.

**A Whisper of Suggestion**

One evening, Michael had fallen asleep early on the couch, exhausted from work.

Elena stayed up.

So did Jake.

She stood in the kitchen, pouring herself a glass of wine, her back to him. She knew he was there, just a few feet away, pretending to read something on his phone.

She shifted her weight slightly, letting one hip pop out, her thin nightgown clinging to the curve. She ran a hand absentmindedly down her neck, letting her fingers trail lower, tracing the delicate lace at the neckline.

She turned, leaning against the counter, watching him.

“Jake,” she said softly.

His head snapped up, startled, as if she had caught him in the act.

Her lips curved.

“I was just thinking,” she murmured, swirling the wine in her glass. “My friend Samantha told me something interesting the other day.”

He swallowed. “Yeah?”

“She said men don’t notice the little things.”

Jake frowned slightly. “Like what?”

“Like…” She tilted her head, as if considering. “The way a woman’s breath changes when she’s thinking about something she shouldn’t.”

Silence.

“Or,” she continued, taking a slow sip of wine, “the way her skin warms when she knows she’s being watched.”

His fingers twitched against the counter.

He didn’t say a word.

He didn’t have to.

She let her gaze drop briefly to his hands—tight, clenched.

And then, as if lost in thought, she reached for a thick candle from the counter, turning it in her hands. Her fingers ran along its smooth surface, wrapping around it, stroking absentmindedly. Her thumb traced slow, lazy circles against it as she continued speaking, her voice soft, distant.

Jake inhaled sharply.

She smiled, letting her grip tighten slightly before she set it down, as if nothing had happened at all.

He left the kitchen in silence.

But she knew he wouldn’t sleep that night.

**The Electricity Between Them**

The air between them shifted after that night.

It was heavier now. Charged.

Elena could feel it crackling between them in every small moment.

When she walked past him in the hallway, her bare shoulder just brushing against his arm.

When she bent to pick something up, the curve of her back arching just slightly, her hair cascading down one side, exposing the smooth line of her neck.

When she licked a drop of coffee off her finger one morning, her tongue flicking against her skin just as his gaze flickered toward her.

She pretended not to notice.

But she did.

God, she did.

And the way he looked away too quickly, the way his breathing changed, the way his hands clenched into fists—he was trying so hard not to react.

Trying so hard not to want her.

And that was the most thrilling part of all.

# A Night of Near Confessions

It was late. Michael was out with friends.

Elena stood by the open window, the summer night air warm against her skin. She wore a thin camisole and soft pajama shorts, nothing indecent, but enough to reveal the smooth length of her legs, the gentle curve of her waist.

She felt him before she heard him.

Jake.

Standing in the doorway.

Neither of them spoke at first.

Then—

“Can’t sleep?” His voice was low, rough.

She turned, resting one hand against the window frame. “No.”

A pause.

“Me neither.”

Another pause.

A dangerous one.

She let the silence stretch, watching him. His eyes flickered downward for just a second—so quick, but not quick enough.

He was looking.

She stepped forward, slow, deliberate. “Do you ever wonder…” she began, voice soft, almost a whisper. “What it would be like?”

His breath hitched. “What?”

She smiled.

“Being with someone you shouldn’t,” she murmured.

The room felt smaller. The air, thicker.

Jake’s hands clenched at his sides, his knuckles white. “Elena.” His voice was strained, rough with restraint.

She tilted her head, watching him, feeling the heat between them coil tighter, hotter.

“Tell me to stop,” she whispered.

Jake’s jaw tightened. His entire body was tense, rigid, like he was barely holding himself back.

Finally—

A sharp exhale.

Then he turned, leaving the room without another word.

Elena smiled.

She had won.

# The Thrill of What Would Never Happen

Days passed.

The tension didn’t fade. If anything, it grew stronger.

Jake avoided her now. Or at least, he tried.

But Elena knew.

She knew that even when he wasn’t looking, he was *thinking* about looking.

She knew that every time she walked into a room, his body reacted before his mind could stop it.

She knew that at night, when he lay in bed, staring at the ceiling, he thought about the way her lips curved when she spoke, the way her fingers lingered against the rim of her glass, the way she moved—soft, slow, deliberate.

She knew.

And that was enough.

She would never touch him.

Never kiss him.

Never let it happen.

Because the tension was the best part.

Because the wanting was more intoxicating than the having.

And because some games were never meant to be finished.

Only played.

Forever.

It started innocently enough. I stopped at a new café near my office, and as I was paying, the barista smiled and said, *""The usual, right?""* I froze. I’d never been there before. But instead of correcting her, I just nodded.  

She handed me a lavender latte with oat milk—something I’d never order—and said, *""See you tomorrow, Alex.""*  

I’m not Alex.  

But the latte was *amazing*. So the next day, I went back. The barista (whose name tag read *""Maya""*) brightened when she saw me. *""Double shot today, Alex? Tough Monday?""* I played along. *""You know me so well,""* I said, as if we had a history.  

It became a game. I’d drop hints to flesh out ""Alex’s"" persona: *""Ugh, my cat kept me up all night""* (I don’t own a cat). *""Can’t wait for my weekend hiking trip""* (I’m allergic to nature). Maya would nod sympathetically, sometimes even adding details: *""You and your cat, I swear!""*  

I felt guilty, but also… weirdly seen. Maya remembered ""Alex’s"" quirks, and for the first time in years, I didn’t feel like just another customer.  

Then, disaster struck.  

This morning, I walked in to see Maya laughing with a guy in a Patagonia vest. As I got closer, I heard her say, *""Alex, you’re late! I made your latte five minutes ago.""*  

The *real* Alex turned, frowning at me. *""Uh, hey. Do I know you?""*  

Maya’s smile faltered as she looked between us. *""Wait…""*  

I panicked. *""I—I’ve gotta go.""* I bolted before she could call me out.  

Now I’m hiding in my office, debating whether to ever show my face there again. Was it creepy? Probably. But for a month, I had a barista who cared about ""Alex’s"" fake hiking trips and nonexistent cat. And honestly? I miss her.",16,1743428005.0,self,7,1.0,False

Chapter 27: Maelstrom



Somewhere far from the deafening roars of the arena, in a quiet, dimly lit room, a certain Valkyrie sat, her eyes locked onto a flickering screen.

Her name was Hlökk, one of the thirteen Valkyries, and at this moment, nothing in the world mattered more than the battle she was watching unfold. The television in front of her displayed the clash between King Arthur and Quetzalcoatl, the legendary king and the creator god locked in a struggle that would determine the fate of humanity.

Her hands were clenched into fists, resting on her lap, her body slightly leaning forward in anticipation. She refused to miss a single moment. Suddenly—

Knock knock.

The abrupt noise jolted her from her concentration. ""Come in!"" she called out, not even tearing her eyes from the screen.

The door creaked open, and in stepped a gentleman with silver hair and a neatly trimmed moustache, carrying a tea set on a silver tray. His posture was poised, his movements graceful. His heterochromatic eyes, one a deep crimson, the other a duller grey, gleamed in the dim lighting as they settled on her.

""Apologies for the interruption, milady,"" he said in his usual polite tone, his English accent smooth and composed. ""I brought tea.""

Hlökk finally turned to him, narrowing her eyes. ""Jack, where have you been?! The third round is going on right now! I was starting to think you weren't coming!"" Jack smiled, a smile that was simultaneously charming, eerie, and reassuring. He adjusted his gloves before setting the tray down on the coffee table in front of her.

""My sincerest apologies, dear Hlökk. But you should know by now..."" he raised a gloved hand, pointing a single finger toward the ceiling, ""a gentleman never breaks a promise to a lady.""

Hlökk rolled her eyes, crossing her arms. ""Yeah, yeah, whatever. Just sit down already!""

Jack chuckled softly, removing his coat with practiced elegance before taking a seat beside her at the coffee table. With precise, practiced hands, he began pouring two cups of tea, the delicate clinking of porcelain the only sound besides the television.

Jack the Ripper. That was the name he had once been known by. The fourth representative of humanity in the previous Ragnarök. He had stood against Heracles, the mighty hero of Olympus, and against all odds, he had won. Hlökk had been his Valkyrie partner, the one who had merged her very soul with his to grant him the divine weapon he needed to claim victory.

After their fight, after the blood and carnage, the two had found an odd sort of camaraderie. To Hlökk, Jack was like an older brother, eccentric, meticulous, and frustratingly polite. They had spent the remainder of the tournament together, watching the other battles unfold side by side. And now, it seemed they had started a tradition. Just like before, Jack had come to watch the Ragnarök with her.

Jack took a careful sip of his tea before turning his gaze to the television, watching as Arthur and Quetzalcoatl clashed. His crimson and silver eyes flickered with curiosity.

""Who may I ask is fighting?""

Hlökk didn’t take her eyes off the screen. ""King Arthur and Quetzalcoatl.""

Jack’s expression shifted ever so slightly. ""King Arthur, you say...?""

For the briefest moment, Jack’s mind wandered. Before his death, he had spent some time searching for Arthur’s lost treasures, the relics left behind by the once and future king. Though Jack had walked the shadows of London’s alleys, he had always held a peculiar fascination with the legends of Camelot. 

Perhaps it was the Englishman in him. Perhaps it was respect for a fellow legend. Either way, the thought of seeing Arthur Pendragon in battle stirred something within him.

He activated his gift. A power he had been born with, one that had shaped his entire existence. A sight beyond sight. As he gazed upon Arthur and Quetzalcoatl, their colours emerged before him.

Brilliant hues flooded his vision. Something caught Jack’s attention the most.

There was no hatred. No fury. No malice. Only mutual respect. Two warriors, two legends, locked in combat, not as enemies, but as equals.

Jack exhaled softly, a genuine smile forming on his lips. ""Marvellous.""

The arena trembled as Quetzalcoatl recovered just in time to raise the World Carver, intercepting Arthur’s onslaught. The clash of Excalibur and the divine macuahuitl sent a shockwave rippling across the battlefield, dust and debris scattering into the air.

The two warriors pressed against each other, their weapons locked in a struggle of sheer strength and will. Their eyes met. Arthur’s burning with determination, Quetzalcoatl’s alight with amusement and admiration.

""How did you ascertain my connection to the ground?"" the god inquired, his voice steady despite the force they exerted against one another. 

Arthur smirked, his grip tightening on Excalibur. ""I didn’t!"" he admitted with a chuckle, his confidence unshaken. ""I’m usually more of a ‘hit things and ask questions later’ kind of fighter.""

The two pushed off each other, both skidding backward before regaining their stances. For a moment, there was silence. Then there was Laughter. Quetzalcoatl laughed, a deep, joyous sound echoing through the arena.

""You have truly been my most worthy opponent yet,"" the god declared, his golden eyes gleaming with excitement. ""Please, allow me to go all out from now on.""

Arthur blinked in surprise, then scoffed, twirling Excalibur in his grip.

""You’re telling me you haven’t been giving me everything?"" he asked, feigning insult. ""I’m almost offended.""

The king straightened his stance, raising Excalibur toward his opponent.

""As compensation, you can no longer pull your punches against me. And in turn, I will not hold back either!""

Quetzalcoatl’s grin widened. ""It is a deal, Arthur Pendragon.""

Without hesitation, both warriors rushed forward. Their weapons met in a storm of blows, each swing of Excalibur met by the devastating strikes of the World Carver. Sparks erupted with every collision, the force of their attacks sending ripples of power through the arena. Each fighter sought an opening, but neither yielded.

Arthur slid backward, his boots digging into the shifting earth as Quetzalcoatl came to a halt, standing tall and resolute. The god’s expression shifted, his amusement giving way to something more profound. Reverence, respect, and anticipation.

""Here it is,"" Quetzalcoatl said, his voice filled with divine authority, ""this is the very culmination of my being.""

Arthur’s eyes narrowed, watching intently as a strange change came over his opponent. Quetzalcoatl’s eyes began to glow. One a radiant emerald, the other a blazing orange.

Arthur’s mind raced. ""Green for land... Orange for wind... but both at the same time?""

His realization struck like a bolt of lightning. The ground beneath them surged, undulating like the waves of an angry ocean, while the wind roared to life, howling with such force that it became difficult to even remain standing. The earth churned and shifted unpredictably, while the wind tore at everything in its path, whipping up debris and stone, turning them into deadly projectiles that spiralled through the battlefield.

The sky darkened, dust and storm clouds mixing into a swirling maelstrom of chaos. This was no mere combination of powers. This was the true joining of his divine halves.

""KUKULKAN: THE RAGING STORM OF MESOAMERICA!"" The very arena itself became Quetzalcoatl’s weapon.

Even Heimdall felt the sheer force of the unleashed storm. The commentator retreated to the stands, shielding himself from the onslaught. Yet even from this safer vantage point, he could feel the storm’s fury.

""THIS... THIS IS UNLIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE EVER SEEN IN THIS ARENA BEFORE!!"" Heimdall struggled to maintain his composure, his voice carrying through the chaos as he continued his dutiful commentary. ""Q-QUETZALCOATL HAS UNLEASHED THE FULL EXTENT OF HIS DIVINE MIGHT!!! THE BATTLEFIELD ITSELF BENDS TO HIS WILL!! THE WINDS, THE EARTH, EVERYTHING IS HIS WEAPON!!!!!""

I’m a 22 year old female who just got accepted into the MOPA program for this fall. I am not a Vancouver local so I’m on the hunt for somewhere to stay. If the new residence building isn’t going to be ready by September I’m going to be renting elsewhere but I’ve already started looking at prices and they are high (shocker 🙄) I think it makes more sense to find a friend or two to rent a bigger place together and split the cost than a tiny closet in someone’s basement for still over $1000 lol. If you’re interested hit me up (Females ONLY)! 


A little bit about me:
Like I said I’m 22 (I’ll be 23 in November) I don’t care if you’re younger or older than me.  I’m currently living in Saskatchewan. I’m a quiet chill person who prefers a quiet chill  lifestyle so if you’re a partier we likely won’t be a good fit to live together. However, I love going out to grab a coffee, go for a walk, go thrifting or to a movie ect. I’m a neat and clean person and definitely need roommates who are the same for the sake of my mental health. My hobbies include making art, watching movies, reading, cooking, going for walks/bike rides and thrifting. I’d prefer roommates who don’t frequently use drugs or alcohol ( I myself only drink alcohol occasionally ). I’d also really like to be friends with my roommates so please be open to that as I think it would be nice to be able to eat meals together, go to concerts or outdoor excursions together and commute to class together.

I'm working on a school project adapting Aurora Sem Dia by Machado de Assis into a short play. However, I feel like my script might be too long for the 10-minute limit set by my teacher, and my friends insist that plays shouldn't have narration. I’d love some feedback! Should I cut parts of it down? Does narration really not belong in plays?

Please note that English is not my native language and I am desperate for advice on how to adjust this!

 Here’s the script:


Aurora Sem Dia – Play Script

Scene 1 – Morning at Anastácio’s house

Luís: Hey! Do you remember being busy yesterday morning?
Anastácio: What was it?
Luís: Read this sonnet.

(Luís hands over a newspaper.)

Anastácio: This is awful! What does the moon have to do with a woman?
Luís: In my vision, it makes perfect sense—I wrote it myself yesterday.

(Anastácio looks surprised and unimpressed.)

Anastácio: You wrote this? Don’t tell me you want to become a poet!

(Anastácio sounds indignant.)

Luís: One doesn’t become a poet; it’s something innate. You wouldn’t understand the complexity of my verses.

(Luís speaks with arrogance.)


---

Scene 2 – Anastácio seeks Dr. Lemos' advice

Anastácio: Lemos, help me! My godson wants to become a poet. What should I do?
Dr. Lemos: Calm down. Being a poet isn’t so bad. Now I’m curious to read his work.

(Luís enters, overhearing the conversation. Anastácio leaves.)

Luís: Here are some of my unfinished pieces. What do you think?

(He hands over some papers.)

Dr. Lemos: Poetry is tough; it takes time and study. These verses… aren’t great.

Luís: Your opinion is as worthless as my godfather’s! A poet is born, not made!

(Luís, offended, snatches the papers back.)


---

Scene 3 – A hotel restaurant, at a secluded table

Dr. Lemos: Why have you been avoiding me?
Luís: I don’t even know. But when you praised my poetry today, I decided to talk.
Dr. Lemos: Let’s eat first, then you can show me your recent work.
Luís: As you wish.

(After dinner, Luís excitedly pulls out unfinished poems and begins reading aloud. Other customers laugh at him.)

Dr. Lemos: Ignore them.
Luís: How can I? Who respects poetry anymore?
Dr. Lemos: Let’s leave.


---

Scene 4 – A street meeting

Luís: Dr. Lemos, it’s been a while.
Dr. Lemos: I’ve heard you’ve been neglecting your job at the courthouse. They might fire you.
Luís: They already did—yesterday.
Dr. Lemos: Already? What now? Your godfather won’t support you.
Luís: I’ll make money from my poetry. I’ll prove I’m not useless.

(He speaks with pride.)

Dr. Lemos: You’re fooling yourself. Your verses are too complex for the public. I know an attorney looking for a clerk…

(Luís hesitates.)

Luís: Return to the courthouse?
Dr. Lemos: If you want to survive.
Luís: Fine. I’ll take the job.


---

Scene 5 – Luís writes a letter aloud

Luís: ""Dr., I’ve taken an interest in politics after hearing my employer’s discussions. I think I’ve found my true calling. Thanks for referring me to the attorney—I’m becoming a great political writer. I’ll run for office again, but this time, without fraud.""


---

Scene 6 – Outside the Capitol

Attorney: Since you began writing, I believed you could be a deputy.
Luís: Thank you. See you inside.

(Inside, a two-hour debate over a public fountain unfolds. Luís insults the government and fellow politicians. The attorney speaks up.)

Attorney: This man isn’t the talented lawyer we expected—just a mediocre poet. Listen to one of his verses:

> ""To Her. Who are you who torments me
With your delightful smiles?
Who are you who points
To the gates of paradise?
Are you an image of heaven?
A daughter of divinity?
Or do you entangle my freedom in your hair?""



(Luís leaves, humiliated.)


---

Scene 7 – Luís’ home

(Dr. Lemos knocks.)

Luís: Old friend!

(Dr. Lemos is shocked to see Luís dressed as a farmer.)

Dr. Lemos: What happened to you?
Luís: I ruined my literary and political career. When I heard my own verses in the Capitol, I realized how shallow they were. Now, I’m humbler. Life wasn’t meant to give me much. I’m married, I have children… but enough about me! Come in, have some coffee, and let’s catch up.

I ate a little mini croissant every day for 6 days with morning coffee. This is the first week I haven’t tracked every calorie I put in my face since I started taking tirzepatide on June 18, 2024. I just weighed myself and I lost 0.6lb while I was gone. Before I left, I had dropped my dose a bit to minimize some side effects too. So I left it at the slightly lowered dose (split dose of 8.2mg/wk) to ensure I wasn’t nauseous while on vacation. It worked great. Overall I’ve lost 85lb since June 18th. I still have 30-40lb to go, but it was nice to return from a week of just living life and not having any setbacks. I was able to refrigerate my tirzepatide in one hotel, but the second one didn’t have a mini fridge. I just didn’t worry about it and I’ll finish up using that vial first anyway, since it’s already opened. It was so nice to just live life, not track anything and eat food when I was hungry.

1jo2sfs,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1jo2sfs/aita_want_to_ditch_arrange_marriage_guy/,AITA - want to ditch arrange marriage guy,"I (29F) have met this guy 3 times so far. Not getting into the ridiculousness of the process, we all know how it is, but first time we met he seemed really nice. I am way out of his league in terms of looks - but I genuinely didn’t care about that. 

A little context for the first meetup - we met for coffee the first time, and I picked up the bill, which was not much tbh, I make it a point to never pick fancy places for arrange marriage meet ups because I am not there for a free meal, and neither should the other person be. 

He was super nice, we seemed to have a bunch of shared interests as well, and so we agreed to meet a second time. 

The second time as well he asked me to suggest a place, so I picked a popular pizza place because he seems to love pizza. That day he took a small pizza and a bottle of coke, and I wasn’t hungry so I just had a single slice, and a small cup of coke from the bottle. He picked up the bill.

He made some slightly casteist comments that bothered me a little, I have been raised in a very open and accepting environment. Still, we decided to meet again. 

3rd time I asked him to pick a time and place, and he picked a kinda fancy restaurant that was a bit far from where I live (he has a vehicle but I don’t). When I came there he had ordered a starter (had confirmed with me over text if it’s okay to order something) that turned out too spicy for me. I had a little bit, and he finished the rest. We talked for a while and we still disagreed over some trivial things about philosophy, religion etc. 

When the bill came he asked if he could pay, I said sure, but I can also pay, either way is fine. He mentioned that we can split it if you want, which slightly bothered me - and I know that sounds a little hypocritical. I had barely eaten anything, and I had told him at the initial meetups also that I don’t want to get into who pays for what so I don’t really care about meeting in fancy places. We both earn well. 

Secondly, I had picked a pizza place for his love of pizza, but he didn’t do the same for me.  He ordered a starter that was super spicy in the name itself- and by that time we had already talked about food preferences. 

The 3rd date I kinda started getting annoyed as he kept on talking and talking and talking. He keeps saying these quips that he thinks are funny but they’re not funny at all. 

He also mentioned that at some point he would want his parents to live with him because “what if they get sick”, but not once did he mention anything about my parents. I did not push that point further because I know that’s how people are. Nobody cares about the girl’s parents. 

I know a lot of this stuff is really trivial, and I have tried really hard to not be judgemental. He seems like a really nice person on the outset but these trivial things keep bothering me. 

I want to call it off but I don’t think these are good enough reasons to share with anyone. However, I also don’t want to waste his time or my time either, but I also think I might be too picky.

1jo2pgb,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1jo2pgb/fully_newbie_barista_trainee_struggling/,fully newbie barista trainee struggling,"Hi,I'm writing this on my break, and I genuinely feel like I'm going to mess up my training. while I love the refreshing opportunity that this job offers. 

Just as the title says, I'm completely new to this barista experience. The main reason why I wanted to experience being a barista is that I want to improve my verbal communication skills and work portfolio as an introvert. 

After applying to several barista job vacancies, a small cafe near my place finally invited me for an interview and saw my potential to grow as an aspiring barista. I was very excited for my training until I realized how fast-paced the training is going to be. 

On my first day and a few hours of training, the first trainer seemed disinterested in teaching me what I needed to know. Thankfully, the second trainer came in and helped me at least understand the coffee basics and how to operate the espresso machine. I think I did alright! So far, so good, right? 

The second day came in; I was mostly taught how to make more drinks and how to clean the cafe. This was the day I noticed how the training guides on how to make most coffee and non-coffee drinks are not in order. I had to repeatedly ask my trainers and the owner about this, but they only told me that eventually I would be able to familiarize myself with most drinks through muscle memory. This is something I do not have any problem with, but it bothers me that the cafe has a training guide that is not mostly factual at best when it comes to making the drinks in order. Some of my trainers told me to prioritize this, while some of my trainers told me to prioritize that. 

Now, it's my third day of training. I feel like as the day passes by, the pressure to learn better and adapt to the environment is much stronger. I try not to info overload myself, but I am scared that I'm going to mess this all up. It does not help that my new trainer told me I'll probably be stationed on my own on my fifth day of training. Yet it seems unfair, as I have not been exposed much to most of the drinks and how I can properly make them. I had to ask more questions and research the topics after my shifts to at least catch up. 

I just feel like I know what I should do, yet I'm all over the place. I would love to push myself to do better and continue in my training, but it seems like every mistake that I make will be harshly counted against me. I feel like I have to know how to do all the drinks and pastries before my fifth training starts. The info that I'm getting from this training is simultaneously improving my understanding yet draining and is making me confused even more. 

I don't want to quit, as I'm truly grateful that even when I do not have any prior experience, this cafe and the owner believed in my potential to grow. As much as possible, I want to make leaving the last option. To be honest, any advice and encouragement will do! Thank you, and please be kind. : >",1,1743426282.0,barista,5,1.0,False

1jo2p1o,https://www.reddit.com/r/BoomersBeingFools/comments/1jo2p1o/strange_interaction/,Strange Interaction,"I live with my parents and my partner lives with her parents. I spend a couple nights a week at my partners house; typically Friday night through Sunday night. 

Her parents are retired and basically sit at home all day in their massive gated community house watching Fox News. They frequently check their surveillance cameras whenever they get an alert for any movement outside. Deeply scared people. A far cry from my parents who are working class reasonable adults. 

This Saturday morning, about 9:30, they had the windows and sliders open to enjoy the nice weather. I got up to the kitchen to make coffee for my partner and to fill my Stanley cup with ice and water. Her parents are out on the porch watching their other TV. 

The moment the ice starts falling from the dispenser and rattles itself into the steel walls of the cup, my partner’s father comes hustling into the house from the porch. He’s fumbling with his fanny pack as he turns to see me standing there. He starts asking me what the sound was all about. I just told him I was filling my cup with ice. 

He zips up his fanny pack and laughs it off and we exchange the typical “good morning” pleasantries. 

I thought nothing of it until last night my partner and I are sat at the dinner table finishing up our school work. He takes off his fanny pack and invites me to come on over so that he can show me his “new toy”. I obliged and walk on over as he pulls out and unloads a .38 special snub nose revolver. I also enjoy guns and shooting so it was a pleasant interaction. 

He goes about his way and I sit back at the table with my partner. I tell her about the little confrontation the morning prior and how he was digging in his fanny pack when he came hustling into the room. 

Now I know that he is keeping his gun in his bag I am 100% positive he heard that ice dispenser going and immediately though it as threat in his home and he was preparing to confront an intruder with lethal force.

My wife wasn't home and wasn't answering texts.

When she finally got home around 9PM, she was shocked to see me. I confronted her immediately. After some back and forth, she broke down crying and admitted she'd been seeing someone - a personal trainer from her gym named Jake. She said it had been going on for about two months.

I was devastated. I asked her to leave for the night so I could process everything. She begged to stay but eventually went to her sister's place. The next day, I called a lawyer and started looking into divorce options.

Three days later, she comes back crying, saying she made a terrible mistake. But here's where it gets crazy - she claimed she NEVER actually cheated. According to her, this whole thing was a ""loyalty test"" to see if I would fight for our marriage. She claimed ""Jake"" was actually an actor friend of her coworker who was playing a role to make me jealous.

I didn't believe a word of it. The evidence was too clear. So I did something that might make me the asshole here.

I found the gym where she works out. I asked around about personal trainers named Jake. There was only one - a fit guy in his late 20s. I approached him directly and asked if he knew my wife. He looked uncomfortable and tried to avoid the conversation.

I offered him $500 cash to tell me the truth. He hesitated, then admitted that yes, he had been seeing my wife, but she had suddenly cut things off a few days ago. He showed me text messages where she told him they needed to stop because her husband found out, but they could maybe reconnect later. There was nothing about any ""test"" or ""acting role"" in those messages.

I took screenshots of everything and sent them to my wife with a single text: ""Your actor friend Jake confirms everything. Divorce papers coming.""

She completely lost it. Showed up at our house screaming that I had no right to approach Jake, that I was stalking her, and that I had ruined everything. Then she changed her story AGAIN, saying that yes, she had cheated, but the ""test"" explanation was because she panicked and wanted to save our marriage.

Her family and some mutual friends are blowing up my phone saying I went too far by tracking down and essentially bribing Jake. They're saying I humiliated her and should have just accepted her attempt to fix things rather than going ""detective mode.""

AITA for exposing my wife's lie about her affair being a ""test""? Was I wrong to approach Jake directly? I'm proceeding with the divorce either way, but the backlash from her family has me questioning my methods.",1,1743426214.0,FoundandExpose,0,1.0,False

me: why did god say theyd die in ""the very same day"" if they eat the fruit of knowledge? they lived to be almost 1000 years old.

Elderette with happy confidence: Yes but one day to God is like 1000 years of humans.

Me: yeah see ive thought of that, (i pull out my bible and read out Genesis 1:5 (And there was evening and there was morning, a first day) but right there it literally defined a day as evening and morning.

silence.

Elder all humbly: it's a good question ""X"" but rest assured the brothers have put alot of prayerful research into this account, and we dont know forsure, but like you said they lived to be almost 1000 so obviously theres more to it than is written.

Me: yeah fair enough, its just funny that jehovah had allocated entire books into the construction of buildings and religious symbols that were only relevant to the people at that time, but with the most important story ever told he summed it up in a few paragraphs leaving so much room for interpretation.

me again: like why not make the story just read in plain language: ""if you eat the fruit, ill kick you out of the garden, you cant eat from the tree of life, and then you'll slowly die"" I dont know.. based on whats actually written i dont see where satan lied..

BOOOOM whole friggin atmosphere flipped LOL it was glorious watching them squirm.

Elderette with a stern tone: Hold on X youre not saying satan isnt a liar are you?

Me: Noo of course im not saying that, obviously he's satan and he's bad, i just dont actually see where he was wrong (my speed increases so as to squeeze in as many points as possible) check out Genesis 3:22 (they didnt flinch so i went on and read it LOL)- ""Jehovah God then said: “Here the man has become like one of us in knowing good and bad. Now in order that he may not put his hand out and take fruit also from the tree of life and eat and live forever, with that Jehovah God expelled them from the garden of eded"".....  god himself admitted here that They HAD become like ""one of us"" i.e a God.. and they didnt die that same ""day"" which as defined in genesis 1:5 is a 24 hour day. (my tone changes to somber like im all bothered by my discovery) so im just saying, where did satan lie? thats what i dont understand? like why did god not want them to know stuff, why is it that the pursuit of knowledge was punishable by death for infinite generations then, but now without knowledge we cant attain life, it just doesnt make sense... ive been losing sleep over this :(

what felt like a 5 minute pause

Elder: well ""X"" those are some good questions, and its good to weed out any doubts we may have. those sound like the kind of questions you'll have to leave with jehovah and wait patiently for the answer. keep serving and youll eventually here a talk or a comment from someone that will give you clarity.

1jo2hot,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1jo2hot/hr_the_disturbing_case_of_ariana_b_part_1/,[HR] The Disturbing Case of Ariana B (Part 1),"I woke up to a text from him which I wasn’t all surprised by as he said he would text me. Why didn’t he message me when I got home right away? Didn’t he want to know if I got in safe? I know he walked me to my door but is that really enough these days? Hasn’t everybody got to try to stand out? 

I get out of bed, slowly adjusting to the daylight spilling through the gap in my curtains, and head to the bathroom. I brush my teeth in the shower, scrape my hair back and begin picking up some clothes I’d left on the floor to find anything suitable to wear to the office. I hated office days but everyone keeps telling me they’re better for my mental health so why does it make me so sad to actually have to talk to people I don’t like?

I find an old blouse that doesn’t look too creased. Good enough. I put my navy trousers on. They’re tighter than I remember. I blame the pizza I ordered last night. You’re supposed to not look like a fat pig on a first date but he was buying, or I was going to hint that he should, and it would be a nice treat to have something that wasn’t a Pot Noodle or a Tesco’s sandwich. I reluctantly say goodbye to my bedroom, my home, my palace, the duvet cast aside on the floor, most likely covering the half-empty cup of tea I remember making last night. 

I wipe my eyes and head down the stairs. I did drink a lot last night, didn’t I? Are you supposed to drink that much on a first date? He’d ordered a beer when I’d hoped he’d order a bottle of wine to share because drinking by the glass is lame. 

Kirsten was in the kitchen clicking away on her laptop. She wrote so furiously. FUCK OFF Kirsten. 

“Morning,” I say to her, beaming.

She nods and wishes me good morning too, not looking up from her laptop screen. She thinks she’s important, that’s the thing with Kirsten. But she lives here with me, paying the same amount of rent. And I have fucking nothing. So she can’t be *that* important.

I find my Chilly flask from the cupboard, expertly pushed right to the back by Kirsten, so I push other mugs out of the way to retrieve it, making sure if I saw the one that was Kirsten’s favourite, it would replace my flask. She didn’t drink coffee. I don’t think anyway? I can’t remember. We never spoke anymore. It was her place - well, her flatmate moved out and she’d put the ad in the paper. She definitely didn’t own it because Darren our landlord once sent me a picture of his dick. I found him on Facebook and his profile picture had a woman in it. I hovered over messaging her for so long before I decided against it. Sleeping outside looks rough. 

“I’m out today. I’ll be back at around six,” I tell her.

“Okay, I’ll be in all day.”

“Cool.”

“Yeah it is. Might need a coat today.”

I didn’t let her talk anymore. When we met, she’d insisted on not just showing me around but taking me out for a glass of wine. To get to know me better. I didn’t mind because I’d been living at my Dad’s so long that if they drafted me up to fight in Ukraine, I’d be eager. She had seemed nice but I had my friends and didn’t need anymore so I’d let her natter on. She probably explained what she did, why she was single, why she loved her job that night but after the third glass I’d stopped paying attention. I was just happy to be in the company of someone new. Someone who didn’t know me. 

The best thing about my apartment is that it is so close to a Tube stop. That’s fucking rare in London. Even when the place is full of Tubes. I tap my card, descend on the esculator before I remember my headphones and look to find them in my coat pocket. The low battery warning blared before playing whatever nonsense I’d been playing when I’d got home. The Carpenter’s Greatest Hits. Who the fuck are they?

I try not to look on my phone. It’s harder than you think. When the alarm sirened, dragging me from my peaceless sleep, it’d just said his name and ‘iMessage’. I didn’t like to know what they sent straight away. If Abbie or Katie text me, usually ‘hey hows it going’ or ‘what was the place called where we went jet skiing in 2017? x’, I could at least pretend for a moment they had something important to say. No. He should’ve text me when I got home last night. He walked me to my door, Ariana, cut him some slack. Urgh. Am I one of these people who refer to themselves in the third person?

6 mins until the next train. That’s too long in 2025. Everything I want at my fingertips except reliable public transport. I put some Rihanna on and tried to groove and got on the train. I found myself tapping, nodding along to the beat like those weirdos you see alone on the tube. Urgh, this fucking headache. Why didn’t I take some paracetamol this morning? Why did I waste my time talking to Kirsten about coats when I could’ve been medicating myself. 

Fumbling through my coat pocket, I found the remanants of a disposable vape. I look around, deciding whether I’m sneaky enough to get a quick vape before someone gives me the stare. It’s too busy, I’ll wait till I get off. Besides, there won’t be any left anyway. 

At the office, Dan greets me. He’s gay. Or he looks gay. He says he hasn’t seen me in a while and I told him I’m always working from home and he says I need to come in more and see everyone and I don’t say anything back but smile and walk to my desk.

It’s got a package on it, weirdly. I never got post. Who gets post delivered to work?

“It’s your new desk decorations as part of the rebrand,” Charlotte says, the girl who sits behind me. She’s got a cup of tea and now I want one.

“Why’s there so much cardboard?”

“You know these corporate types,” she says, sitting down and clicking the keys to fire up the monitor, “they want the world to burn.”

“Don’t we all?”

Charlotte laughs. She’s worked here about a month less than I have but she definitely likes it more than I do. She goes out after work with a few of the younger, more vibrant types in Accounting and Commercial. I’d rather drive pins in my eyes. My Friday nights are messaging Katie and Abbie in our dwindling WhatsApp group asking if they’ve got plans. They’ve both got boyfriends, Abbie’s now a fiancee, and their weekends are planned well in advance. Spotaneity only belongs the young and naive and the single.

I start working. I don’t do any more or any less than I do at home. Nobody cares but I hope somebody will notice and just decide to keep me there. We have a rota of who can work from home. Often on days I’m due in, I’ll say I’m not feeling 100% and they usually let me. 

I hate asking for permission. I’m twenty-six years old.

At lunch time, I nip out to the Tesco’s, get myself a meal deal and return to my desk. I’m not eating in the break room today unless Simon’s in but I can’t see him and it isn’t worth the social humilation of circling, not finding a group to call your own to sit with and returning to your desk. Best just head for a soft and easy landing on your desk. I brush the crumbs off my desk and onto the floor, flicking through my phone and check the messages. 

*I had a nice time tonight. Thanks. See you soon? X*

One kiss is good. We hadn’t exchanged any before that message. It’s a declaration of war to send the first X. I wonder if younger people send five/six to each other like the world is an orgy. It’s a good message. I’m happy. I send him a short one back.

Seconds later, three dots appear. Fucking score. 

\----

I get home after the time I told Kirsten. I’m still craving pizza so I bought a frozen one on the way home. Who does their full food shop at six o’clock on a weekday though? Psychopaths, that’s who. I put the pizza into the cold oven and whack the tempature up. I delude myself that I don’t want to go on TikTok and spend the entire time the pizza takes to cook scrolling on it so I reread the messages I exchanged with Teddy earlier today. 

We were back and forth like Ross and Rachel. He’d say something and then I’d say something back. How about that? We spoke about the dinner we had last night. We spoke about our weekend plans - it was Thursday so it was important to not be alone for the weekend! The last message was the best one. He asked if I fancied going to see Wicked in the West End and then dinner afterwards. A show? What kind of fucking Prince Charming takes someone to see a show on their second date? I said yes, jumped around a little on my chair in the office, and skipped home. Everywhere I went, people started applauding me for landing a second date. “It was nothing, really,” I tell them. “He just did what he was supposed to.”

The pizza’s done and I slide it onto a plate expertly. Armed with a bottle of ketchup, I run up the stairs. I throw my clothes onto the evergrowing pile and collapse onto my bed, balancing my pizza on my knees as I tear a slice. Fuck, do I have a pizza cutter up here? I aren’t going back down to make small talk with Kirsten before sheepishly running off with the pizza cutter that she no doubt bought. I load up the TV before I take my first bite. Working from home tomorrow. Lusicous. And then it’s the weekend and I’m going out with Teddy. He didn’t mention where he wanted to go for dinner afterwards. Where he picks will be a big decision for him. If he wants a quick bite, do I ghost him? I start to think of all the bad situations as to why he would he even want to bring me to a west end show in the first place. Did he buy these tickets for another girl and she’s flaked? 

Stop thinking stupid thoughts and eat, I snap at myself. I take the first bite and it’s too hot, I wretch the food in my mouth, take a slug of water to make the whole thing a congeeling mess while it cools down. Netflix never has anything good on it anymore, does it? 

The algorithm has spent years learning about who I am and it still doesn’t have a clue. I’m presented with the top 10 choices in the UK, all sentimental garbage which I scroll past. Then more romcoms, I don’t watch that many, do I? and then more big budget action films that I’d rather watch paint dry than. It’s only when the Disturbing Case of Ali B comes up then I shudder and drop the pizza out of my hand. Another one? Really?

I never watched true crime documentaries - despite everyone else my age watching them religiously. Everybody is a sleuth, a crime scene expert, pointing out the obvious flaws in the case that no doubt the detectives had too but just couldn’t prove. I’d watched the Zodiac Killer one, and the Hollywood film, because Katie had said it’d be good for me and she said she had enjoyed it. It was good, to be fair. California was so far away, wasn’t it? And it happened so long ago. You can’t feel anything when you’re that removed from the case. When I was a kid, my Mum and Dad had watched loads. Which was wrong. Their therapists had said that it might be a good coping mechanism, something to help them comes to terms with the frightening horrors of everyday existence. That was a long time ago. I couldn’t imagine that being the way to navigate trauma in this snowflake of a world. 

Another Ali B one? What’s this - the fifteenth one? I don’t even think it was the only one released this year. What is it about little Ali that everyone seems to be so fascinated by? I could guess. Well, I say guess. It’s obvious, isn’t it? I’m sure you know why everyone is obsessed with the Ali B case. He did it, didn’t he?

It’s hard being Ariana B sometimes. Even people at work knew who I really was. I don’t know how because I didn’t tell them. Jennifer, one of the gossips who’d left a long time ago, had come up to me once while I was pouring boiling water in my mug.

“I hope you don’t mind me asking this. And please don’t feel the need to admit it, if I’m right. And if I’m wrong, please don’t feel the need to correct me. I’m not sure how to ask this. I’m not sure if I should. But…are you *the* Ariana B?”

Why had she phrased it like that? So long and drawn out. Everyone who asked me always did it it like that. Like I was a celebrity everybody knew to be standoffish and would swear and kick up a fuss if they asked for a picture. People asked me in bars, coffee shops, on the fucking Tube. I can’t remember what I’d said to Jennifer. I think I nodded. Or told her to fuck off. You can’t go to HR after being told to fuck off after a question like that. *The* Ariana B. I’m not a fucking popstar.

You’re probably all on the edge of your seats wondering why I’ve got a *the* in front of my name. It’s not all the time, really it isn’t. It’s only sometimes but even then it’s too much. And they’re all usually weirdos anyway so its not like being properly famous where fit guys and famous people come up to you. I wonder if anyone famous does know me and I could watch a concert from backstage? Why is backstage so good anyway? You can’t see the performer. 

I’m the much younger sister of Ali B. Yeah, can you believe it? And before you ask, not one penny of this documentary money goes to me. It goes to my Mum and Dad, which is fair because I wasn’t even alive during the tragedy and they were and still aren’t right after it. I was the saviour baby, the Jesus Christ, the last chance stab at a dwindling marriage which had been hounded and bombarded by CSI, private investigators, tabloids, mainstream journals and then all these true crime docuseries production companies. 

Dad does some part time thing for a gallery now I think. He used to be a good artist but he can’t be arsed anymore. He used to do it professionally before Ali died. His inspiration died with her. Mum doesn’t work. They make enough money from these stories to live in decent parts of London, living relatively middle class lives. They’re much more recognisable then I am so they couldn’t go settle down into a little office space and grind away the hours like I do. 

The Disturbing Case of Ali B. It’s not even a good title, is it? It’s clickbait. It is disturbing, they’re right, but it’s not flashy enough for me. What ever happened to a little bit of fucking mystique. I hated them all, of course. *When The Light Flickers* was a better title. To be honest, that was a good one. They showed that one at Cannes and it won a load of awards. Mum and Dad went to the premiere and everything, answered questions and cried on camera. I don’t even know what the title meant until about five years ago when I was sat with Dad on the couch and we were channel surfing and it was on Sky Documentaries and I turned and asked him. I’m not sure why I asked him because I never, ever, as a rule, spoke about Ali. 

“The dodgy streetlight out there,” he’d said, waving his arm in the direction as if that would allow me to spot exactly what he meant. “That’s where they found her.”

How awful right? Before you ask, yes, I am a replacement baby. Isn’t that terrible and tragic? I know everyone thinks it. Maybe I am the reincarnated Ali B? We don’t look anything alike but what does that mean when she died at four years old? It’s freeing, actually. I dread to think the level of expectation that would’ve been placed upon her shoulders as a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, bubbly little girl. All I had to do was stay alive and I was onto a winner.

I don’t eat my crusts. I leave them cascading on top of each other, gnawing off the remnants of the tomato base while I hover over the play button. Automatically, the trailer starts to show. And I watch. I watch my Dad on screen, so much younger, so much sadder. I see my parents cry and my big sister as a baby. Big sister? Was she my big sister?

I’m not watching this shite. I can’t bring myself to. 

I find my laptop and google the name of the docuseries. 52% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes. What is the point anymore? The audience don’t want it. Or do they? 

*Nothing new here* says one of the reviews. *Old footage rehashed* says another. Is anybody surprised? *We need to find Harry W* another says. *We need to hear his side of this.* This review isn’t fitting with the other scathing reviews. Fuck off Ben from the New York Times. Just fuck off. Harry W is probably dead, I reason. He must’ve killed himself. Could he live through the guilt? I click on the image of Ben and read his other arts reviews for the New York Times. He comments snootily on made-for-TV trash. What a way to make a living. I find his LinkedIn and scroll down. I’m logged into mine, though I never use it, but I hope he gets a notification that Ariana B is scrolling through his profile, eyeing him up with hatred. Harry W is the last person anybody needs to see. My god though. If someone did manage to get ahold of him. What a scoop!

I’d spent my teenage years drowning out my existentialism with Nirvana and other SubPop bands. I didn’t like them when they went major. My Mum and Dad were at the boiling point of their marriage which would lead to a length court battle where they forced me to choose who to live with. In the end, I chose my Dad. He didn’t talk to the press as much, if you can believe they hounded us for so many years. Nineteen years after Ali’s death, in my fifteenth year of age, people still speaking to us, asking the same questions over and over again. Harry’s name came up a lot. “What would you say to Harry if he was here?” 

Harry W was my sister’s killer. That isn’t an outrageous take. It’s the public opinion of everybody but the jury that saw him innocent. Nobody knows where he is now. You can’t just go back home after a trial like that. The government were forced to take care of him. He, despite thorough investigation by the press and myself on my laptop before the internet was as good as it is now, had a new life. It was very unlikely he was in the country anymore. This was before Brexit - he was probably in Armenia by now. Harry W was the UK’s OJ Simpson. His DNA was found on her clothes. Her DNA was found in the back of his van. The van was spotted on CCTV parked about a quarter of a mile from the house where my Dad still lived. 

Harry W had been a stand-up businessman in our town. He organised charity events, had captained the local rugby team in his youth, and owned a factory that employed the better part of the town. He was the reason so many aimless, young men didn’t have to commute into London. They built parts for railways, or something pointless and stupid like that which you never thought to start a business yourself doing but those people always were the richest. He’d come from money, some but not a lot, and was a figurehead of where we lived. My Mum and Dad had never heard of him but that didn’t matter because a lot of people did. Is that why he was found innocent? He had an alibi, several middle managers of his swear he was out at the Old Dusty, a pub in the centre, with them all night. He was apparently so drunk he wouldn’t have been able to drive that van and the defence had ran with the notion that it had been stolen - an unhappy former employee had done this in spite. Who would try to abduct a little girl from her sleeping bed out of spite? 

Harry hadn’t been completely successful though. She must’ve woken, screamed and he’d killed her before he could go any further with her. In a state of sheer panic, he abandoned her by the streetlight opposite the house where a dogwalker found her in the morning. Out on the street. For the whole town to see. 

The trailer shows his face and I turn it off. Some of the edgier documentaries, which only got shown on YouTube, went down the conspiracy route that my Mum and Dad did it. Luckily, we didn’t have to spend too much time on that avenue before they got Harry Wink’s van speeding off six minutes after the coroner had said she died. I’d seen that before on the JonBenet Ramsay one, one I’d watched over and over again as a teenager.

I’ve grown up now and I can’t stomach them anymore. Am I going in the opposite direction? I find some juice by my desk, my computer monitors flickering in the background that they’re disconnected from a source, and go into the bathroom and fill myself a glass.

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm into all kinds of different hobbies. I'm really into houseplants and aquarium keeping. I have over 100 different houseplants. I just got a small greenhouse now, too. I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, ASE and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it. So, if you know any good emulators or anything for it, then let me know.

Hi everyone! My name is .... (I don't want my personal info on here) , I’m 27 years old and live in .... I have a dog named ..., who is 9 years old.  
I’m currently finishing my degree in health technology engineering.

After coming out of a long-term relationship and with several friendships slowly fading over time, I’ve occasionally felt lonely. I miss the sense of safety and joy that comes with close friendships – the kind where you can share the fun, the tough, and everything in between.

**About me:** My friends describe me as empathetic, loyal, and a good listener. I love deep conversations – but also the silly ones where you can just be yourself and talk about anything from new hobbies, series, and other random interests that pop up.  
I enjoy walks, working out, creative projects, books, and experimenting in the kitchen. I'm a true foodie (sushi is a big favorite!) and would love to find friends to have dinners with.

I love getting out and experiencing new things – whether it's concerts, street food, board games, cultural events, or just a spontaneous walk.

**What I’m hoping for:**  
Close friendships where there’s room for presence, laughter, support, and spontaneous fun – whether that’s a coffee meet-up, movie night, a walk, board games, or just a chat over a cup of coffee. I hope to meet people who – like me – want to invest in a connection, where it feels natural for both to reach out and genuinely want to get to know each other.

I'm looking for friendships with people around 24–35 years old in the .... area and ..... – so if any of this resonates with you, please don’t hesitate to reach out. I’d love to hear from you!

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Alright, baseball aficionados and those just here for the snacks, buckle up for a showdown that promises to be as thrilling as watching paint dry—if that paint were doused in adrenaline and served with a side of nachos. The San Francisco Giants are set to face off against the Houston Astros, and it's shaping up to be a classic battle of ""who can hit the ball better than a toddler with a wiffle bat.""

Let's talk about the pitchers. Jordan Hicks for the Giants had a decent first season as a full-time starter, which is like saying your uncle's garage band is ""not bad."" Meanwhile, Ronel Blanco of the Astros is coming off a 2.80 ERA season, which is impressive enough to make even the most jaded baseball fan nod in approval.

Now, the Astros have been struggling at the plate like a cat trying to catch a laser pointer, hitting just .176 and scoring a mere six runs in their first three games. The Giants, on the other hand, have been swinging for the fences, hitting five home runs in their opening series, but their overall batting average is still under .220, which is about as comforting as a lukewarm cup of coffee.

The odds are as tight as your favorite pair of skinny jeans after the holidays. The Astros are favored with a moneyline of 1.83, while the Giants are the underdogs at 2.05. Given the Astros' strong bullpen performance and Blanco's solid track record, it's hard not to lean towards Houston taking this one.

So, what's the best bet here? I'd say go with the Astros straight up. At 1.83, the odds are decent enough to make you feel like a savvy investor without having to pretend you understand cryptocurrency. Plus, with the Giants' penchant for inconsistency, betting on them feels like trying to predict the weather in San Francisco—foggy at best.

In conclusion, expect the Astros to eke out a win, but don't be surprised if the Giants make it interesting. After all, baseball is a game of surprises, and who doesn't love a good plot twist? Just make sure you have your snacks ready, because this game might just be the highlight of your Monday night.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the age-old battle between the St. Louis Cardinals and the Los Angeles Angels. It's like watching a Shakespearean play, only with more sunflower seeds and fewer soliloquies. As we gear up for this three-game series at Busch Stadium, let's dive into the stats and odds with the precision of a Miles Mikolas fastball.

The Cardinals, sitting pretty at 3-0, are the favorites here with a moneyline of 1.76 on FanDuel. They've been winning 51.9% of games when favored, which is slightly better than my success rate at predicting the weather. Their .392 slugging percentage last season was about as exciting as a lukewarm cup of coffee, but hey, they're undefeated so far this season, so let's not rain on their parade just yet.

On the other side, the Angels come in with a 2-1 record and a moneyline of 2.12. They were underdogs in 130 games last season and managed to win 41.5% of them—kind of like the kid who always gets picked last in dodgeball but somehow ends up being the MVP. However, with a 26th-ranked ERA of 4.57, their pitching staff might as well be throwing beach balls.

Key players to watch include Miles Mikolas for the Cardinals, making his first start of the season, and Brendan Donovan, who hit .278 last season with 14 home runs. For the Angels, Tyler Anderson will also be making his first start, while Taylor Ward, who slugged .426 with 25 home runs last season, will be looking to send a few balls into orbit.

Now, for my best bet: With the Cardinals' solid start and the Angels' pitching woes, I'm leaning towards the Cardinals on the moneyline at 1.76. If you're feeling adventurous, consider the Cardinals to cover the -1.5 spread at 2.46. And for those who like to live on the edge, the over on 8.0 total runs at 1.83 could be a fun ride, given both teams' penchant for offensive fireworks.

So, grab your popcorn, your officially licensed MLB gear from Fanatics, and your Fubo subscription, because this series promises to be more entertaining than a cat video marathon. Play ball!

I really want to relax into my feminine receptive energy as I have great people around me but I can't accept help or compliments etc . I know the people giving these small acts of help would love for me to accept it. Even if someone opens a door for me I will tell them to please go first... silly things like that!

Life is really good, but it's busy. I would love to just sloooowwww the pace down inside and not be in such a rush
 Life is beautiful and I want to enjoy it! 

I'd love to take the time for more self care, especially bathing with candles and moisturising after then doing skincare, but I don't feel relaxed enough to do that / am not motivated to do it probably cause of my cortisol levels!

I practice yoga a lot, and it really does help, but only for the 24 hours after. If I don't go for 2 days, I don't feel calm, soft and receptive.

1jo2951,https://www.reddit.com/r/asklinguistics/comments/1jo2951/whats_up_with_the_hoosier_twang/,What’s up with the Hoosier Twang?,"So growing up in Central Indiana, we’re kind of on the line between the Southern dialects and the Midwestern dialects. We certainly don’t talk like Michiganders or Chicagoans. In fact, we can quickly recognize when someone is from the upper four counties closest to Chicago (they say their As weird. All As /ei/, /æ/, and /a:/. Not sure exactly what they become, but it’s different enough to hear).

Anyway, I absolutely can’t hear the difference between en and in, except in the word “crème brûlée” for some reason; I think it might be a hyperforeignism for my accent. But I remember in elementary school everyone being so confused when someone would compliment us for being so quiet by saying, “You could hear the drop of a pen in here”…because a pen makes a really loud sound when you drop it. It wasn’t until high school that I realized they were saying “pin.”

I can’t really tell if I have the caught/cot merger or not. We had an art teacher that said “on” with a very heavy almost “own” similar to how New Yorkers say coffee. But I can hear the difference between gaudy and goddy. I’m not sure. I try to make a difference between drama and trauma, but I’m wondering if I’m consciously making it since I learned about it. Maybe sometimes I have it and sometimes I don’t.

Then the weirdest noise is /u:/. I feel like sometimes the oo sound approaches the front of my mouth. Even the word school sounds almost like /sky.əl/ to my ear, as if I’m saying “skill” with slightly parched lips. But in the goodnight song from the “Sound of Music” I can clearly hear an exaggerated /ad’y: ad’y: ty jy ənd jy ənd jy.y:/ in the line, “Adieu, adieu to you and you and you.” But then, I can’t hear /y/ vs /u/ vs even /ø/ when I’ve been exploring other Germanic languages.

As someone who works in PR and media discourse analysis, this is giving *heavy* damage control energy. Here’s why:

# Classic PR Playbook

* **Suspicious timing**: This drops right after the whole Ryan Reynolds scandal resurfaces. The clip of his daughter saying that wildly inappropriate Deadpool line, plus the ongoing legal mess between Blake and Justin Baldoni. The timing is not a coincidence.
* **Redirection 101**: We go from child exploitation allegations and lawsuits... to donuts. It’s a complete narrative shift.
* **Humanizing tactic**: The “celebrity does normal thing” trope is a PR classic. Her behind the counter, smiling and serving coffee? Designed to be relatable and disarming.
* **Warm, cozy language**: The article leans hard into phrases like “she was in a really happy mood” and “this is a place that makes me happy.” This is emotional framing to soften her public image.

# Discourse Analysis: What story is this really telling?

* **Performative happiness**: Blake posting about how this place makes her happy is a way of signaling: “Nothing’s wrong! No scandals here!” She’s creating emotional contrast to the headlines she’s *not* addressing.
* **Image reframe**: From a powerful figure entangled in a $400M defamation case and sexual misconduct allegations… to a cheerful small-town girl baking donuts. It's a strategic rebranding.
* **Silence = narrative control**: The article doesn’t mention the scandals. That silence is part of the message: “This is what we’re focusing on now.”
* **Visual overwrite**: You’re left picturing Blake in an apron, not in a courtroom. That’s the real win for her PR team.

1jo2928,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlannerAddicts/comments/1jo2928/trying_to_figure_out_some_things_about_sticker/,Trying to figure out some things about sticker sellers,"This might be a long, sprawling post - bear with me - and it may not even be that interesting. But my ADHD has hyperfocused and now I can’t stop thinking about it!

Disclaimer: I am NOT pointing fingers at anyone. I am not saying one style is better than another. I am NOT saying that people are lazy/cheating the system/scamming people/doing anything wrong (unless they are stealing art and selling it as their own). I will deliberately NOT be mentioning sellers names or brands (but you’ll probably be able to figure out who some of them are because they’re so prominent) unless necessary for a reference point. All opinions are my own. If you disagree, that’s cool but be polite please. 

I’ve been into planning for about a decade, started in bullet journals, went through smaller hobonichis and now have a nice A5 planner. I love watching content about planning and stationery and personally enjoy florals in a vintage or watercolour style and ‘pretty’ stickers over functional ones and cutesy/kawaii ones. Think Sterling Ink rather than Coffee Monster Co. I would love to make my own stickers for my own enjoyment and potentially to sell in the future however I cannot figure out how to make anything I like that fits that style. I’m not the best artist, I’ll hold my hands straight up to that, but I can draw a nice flower and have a somewhat decent understanding of watercolour and how it works so can create something passable in that sense. However nothing I make resembles anything close to what I’m seeing in stickers that fit my style. Recently I’ve been doing a bit of a deep dive into Etsy and other popular sticker selling sites to try and figure out what the main brands are doing and why I can’t create similar myself.

Personally, like I said, I don’t really care for the stickers of artsy boho women doing things like reading or baking, but one thing I’ve seen time and time again in my browsing is that all of these stickers are incredibly similar. Down to the highlights in the hair, all done the exact same way. The faces are the same. The colour palettes are the same. You can’t distinguish between sellers as to who’s drawn which one, which you normally can do with art. So how are they making these stickers? The floral stickers are similar - all very similar styles, colour palettes and drawing/painting techniques. Very hard to distinguish between one seller and another. And many of them look very AI generated.

Brands/sellers that have a more cutesy/kawaii style seem to be much more open with their process and their original IP content. They’ll make videos showing how they draw the sheets, how they come up with characters, what they’re releasing this week. It’s very clear that if you could think of a character and get people to buy into it, you could probably make it a decent seller. 

I can only think of one person I follow on instagram who draws more vintage pieces and actually shows herself doing it. There’s very little content out there for sellers of stickers that are in more ‘traditional’ art styles like I’m interested in. So that begs the question - why aren’t they showcasing it? Is it because they’re drawing it all by hand then scanning it in? Are they drawing it in procreate/photoshop but relying heavily on pre-made stamps in the programs they use? Do they draw something then layer it with other things in a program like Canva? Or are they straight up just using artwork that other people have made whether that’s legitimately through sites that allow you to buy and redistribute art, or illegitimately by just straight up stealing it? Or do they just think “no one would care to watch me draw three different views of a rose and then colour it on procreate”?

However, now that I am starting to do rosettas, when doing the little ""zig zag"" swirls (gentle left and right movement with my jug), I just noticed that the light movement (swinging) I give to my milk jug is ""contaminating"" my cup and gently swinging my whole coffee. 

I noticed that it's because my jug is in contact, under the spout, with my cup. It made me realize that I have always used the cup as a light ""support"" for my pitcher, to be more stable.

Now I am wondering if that is a mistake and if the jug is supposed to be ""hovering"" in the air, slightly above the cup.

On almost every youtube video I've seen, it's filmed from an angle where I am unsure if the jug touches the cup or if it's hovering.

How do I fix it?","I'm 20 years old, and a few months ago, I started going out with a 23-year-old woman. I'll call her J.

J and I had a very strong connection right away, but things have been quite difficult between us.

From the beginning, it was already hard to go out with J (it took about 2-3 attempts before we finally managed to go out), and even after we did, things didn't get any easier.

J has borderline personality disorder, trauma from her ex-boyfriends, and from the start, she said she didn’t want a relationship.

The problem is that, at the same time J acted this way, she also showed signs of wanting something serious—being romantic, giving gifts to me and my family, wanting me to go out with her and her family, and, surprisingly, getting jealous.

Anyway, despite the good moments we had, these past months have been a mix of her wanting to distance herself during her crises and me always being patient, trying to talk to her and make her feel better.

This went on until mid-November, when we broke up for good. She said we should just be friends and that we wouldn't be together anymore.

Around that time, I randomly met a girl on Instagram (I’ll call her N). N ended up helping me during that period and even gave me advice about the situation.

J and I had a few fights before, but I consider this one the worst.

It was December, I was coming home from work when J sent me a message saying that she had woken up wanting to have sex and was going to do it because someone had invited her (she said it was a guy she had been with before her last ex).

I tried to talk to her at the moment because I was upset, but instead of replying, she went to play League of Legends.

The next night, after things had cooled down, I brought it up again. J said she didn’t actually do it, but she also didn’t admit that she was lying. She simply said she had lost interest.

That’s when I decided to tell her that N had invited me to hang out (which was true). I told her that this girl didn’t seem to have any romantic interest in me—it seemed like just friendship. She had invited me twice for coffee and once to a book club she was organizing at her place with her friends.

I told J and asked if I could go. I even said that if she wanted, we could be in a relationship and I wouldn’t go. That I was only considering it because she didn’t want to date me.

J said it was okay, but from her tone, I felt like it wasn’t.

The next day, J planned with her cousin and pretended to be on a date to make me jealous. That’s when she finally admitted that she had said all that just to test me. She also compared me to her ex-boyfriends.

She blocked me on the messaging app, and in desperation, I ran out of my house to go to hers and brought a bouquet and some things she likes (energy drink and chocolate) to try to fix the situation. I also messaged N, told her we couldn’t talk anymore, and blocked her.

In the end, J and I made up, but now everything has gotten worse.

Some time after the fight, J told me I had messed up by blocking N, and even though she told me to unblock her, I stood my ground and kept N blocked.

However, over time, I started thinking about it and realized that I had really been a jerk to N and that it didn’t make sense to keep her blocked because of J.

J had always been honest with me from the start, always saying she didn’t want anything serious (even though I felt otherwise). She always made it clear that I was her best friend.

Because of that, I ended up unblocking N and apologizing to her a few days ago. She accepted, but she told me not to drag her into this situation again.

The thing is, I didn’t tell J that I was going to unblock N.

On Saturday, J and I went out for coffee and were talking when we got to the topic of our last (now second-to-last) fight.

She insisted on seeing the girl's profile, and seeing her persistence, I admitted that I had unblocked N.

From that moment on, her mood changed, and she wanted to go home. That night, we were supposed to watch a reality show together, but she refused. Shortly after midnight, she sent me a video of her crying. I tried talking to her, and she said I wasn’t honest with her.

Yesterday, things only got worse. She said all she wanted was sincerity and told me that I was never honest with her, that I always lied, and that she didn’t want to have a friend who was a liar.

I kept trying to talk and calm her down, but it just got worse. She called me, cried even harder than before, and asked for N’s profile.

She followed N, N messaged me, and I explained the situation to her. N got mad at me, said that J and I were immature lunatics, and that she had bigger problems than this. She said she never had any romantic feelings for me and that our friendship was dead. Then she blocked me and J.

I told J what happened, she asked for screenshots, and I showed them to her, which only made things worse.

She sent me a long message saying that she forgave me but that it would be better for us to go our separate ways. That she couldn’t pretend nothing had happened.

I insisted and insisted until she got angry and blocked me—which she had said she wouldn’t do.

I got blocked on Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, and on several fake accounts I created on Facebook to try to talk to her.

I even went to her house with chocolate and a letter saying I was at the park near her house, but she didn’t show up or unblock me. She only unblocked me after I started sending 1-cent transactions to her bank account, but she was extremely rude, told me to leave her alone, and then blocked me again.

Despite everything, I don’t want to give up on her. I’m going to write her a letter today and send it again...

She is my best friend. I hope that my letters and time will help heal things... but I also need advice on what to do because I’m not okay.",2,1743424720.0,BPDlovedones,7,0.67,False

Structured turns it into this clean, time-blocked schedule with reminders:

    12:30–1:30 – Lunch  
    1:30–2:00 – Send invoice

I took 1 bupropion and half of the naltrexone as instructed and when I tell you I thought I was going to die…I took it around 8am with a protein bar and a little bit of coffee and about an hour later the nausea hit with the power of 1000 suns. I tried to take a dramamine around 12pm and pretty quickly threw that up and continued to throw up intermittently for the next 2 hours. All of this lasted from 8am-3pm. The vomiting subsided after 3pm but the nausea remained and was mild to moderate.

I guess I am just feeling like this is not worth it. The symptoms were so strong.

Thanks so much. ",5,1743424180.0,Leeds,16,0.86,False

I planned a holiday in the city where he lives to Catchup with my friends and while I was there (m37), we decided to meet for the first time. 

He suggested going down the coast and hiring a house for the evening. We did and I booked it and paid for it while he was going to transfer the money when I seen him.  We met and started the mini vacay.  When we were driving he said he can't pay me until the weekend (2 days away) for his share of accommodation. He was waiting on money from a client (owns his own business). He then said he doesn't have money and can I pay  for it and he'll pay me back in a couple of days. I agreed. Although this was the first time I heard of him not having the money. *we could have cancelled* and just don't coffee and Movie.  
We went on the holiday. I paid for everything, food petrol, dinner out, accommodation, ferry. Even some clothes shopping he wanted.  I believed he'd pay his share on the weekend. I fly home and no money arrived in my account. He said hadnt been paid by a client,  he then started to ask for over $1k, to get materials for his business. I said I didn't have that type of money to lend him. Fast forward 8weeks on and no share of money. He keeps telling me he'll pay on x day but never does. I said even if it's the $50 or what he owes of $509, but nothing. Flase promises.  What can I do try try and get my money back. Am I stupid for believing him in the first place??

Get your pelvis checked!

I was diagnosed with Gastritis at a super young age from gut issues. Essentially I was farting too much and I went to the doctor lol Took some pills for it and it kinda “went away” in my later teens early adult life. 

Come 30 years old and everything hit the fan. Major bloating, burping, inconsistent poops (bouts of diarrhea to constipation). Also weight gain. Feeling of lumps in throat along with really bad allergies and skin issues. I’ve also had really bad back issues my entire life.

I’ve tried EVERYTHING from all Reddit threads. 
- d Limonene I take consistently helps for my heartburn and overall for top level stomach bloating 
- ginger worked well for me as well as bitter foods like coffee when I could tolerate. 

I’m on a trip to Singapore and the marketing for this “pelvis” therapy caught my eye. Ive done three sessions with them and I can’t even believe how quick the changes are. It’s almost unbelievable - i have an appetite in the morning and i actually get hungry throughout the day, I don’t get bloated, I can eat practically anything without issues, I have normal timed bowels and no sense of urgency. I’m currently eating a strawberry tart and iced coffee at 8 pm lol it really feels like how I used to garbage dispose when I was in my 20s.

When I got here I was taking up to 8 pills a day sometimes more before meals to help. The only thing I’ve taken in the last three days has been ginger lol cause I’m still traumatized. 

There could possibly be other factors in play, but I came here super bloated with diarrhea and constipation. I was only able to really eat 1-2 meals a day.

I was too excited about this feeling and just wanted to speak it into the Reddit universe 

Check out your posture and your pelvis! I’m hoping to continue this with my chiropractor in the states.

1jo1ymc,https://www.reddit.com/r/tifu/comments/1jo1ymc/tifu_accidentally_took_an_edible_before_date/,TIFU: Accidentally took an edible before date,"TIFU I 22F accidentally took an edible before a date and didn’t realize until it started hitting an hour into the date with 22M. We met on hinge and had been talking for the last few days. The conversation was good on text, but I felt like I was sometimes texting a little more and waiting for his replies. I was already anxious beforehand and my friend thought a cbd gummy would help but it was accidentally a real gummy. I started feeling weird and at first thought it was my new adhd meds and told him in that very moment oh I just got recently diagnosed and I think since I took it before eating it was affecting me badly. Because in that moment I was feeling the racing anxious feeling, but then I realized slowly that oh no something else was wrong. The date was going really well too before everything we were joking around and having a great conversation. I had recommended this really cute Italian place and we both really enjoyed our food. He could definitely tell something was wrong, after I said it was my meds and said we could continue the date as a walk outside. We walked around for almost an hour after. I honestly think he wanted to leave as there was also people next to us and I literally was talking and making zero sense. I’m so embarrassed I tried texting him later that evening when I saw he just read my last text to apologize. After the walk in person I did try apologizing (but didn’t mention that I might’ve taken the wrong gummy) and said that I’d like to see him again and hopefully in better conditions, and he said yes, I had initially also texted him right after saying he was a super nice guy and thanking him again. And he said not to worry that he had a great time, but he was definitely saving face. After seeing he just read my last text, I wanted to explain that my friend thought she had given me a cbd gummy to make me less anxious and accidentally gave me a cbd/thc one and it caused me to freak out, but I quickly realized he had already blocked me and unmatched on hinge. I literally think I was talking in circles and my mouth was dry and sticking everywhere, I probably looked like a crackhead. Near the end of the walk I just felt terrible and pretended I was going home and had him walk me to my car. He had ubered to the restaurant too and it was almost like 30 minutes away from him as he’s a Canadian at grad school and didn’t have his car down here, we are in California.  But instead went to a gas station got some water then walked around for a while before finding a coffee shop to sit in for hours until it wore off. Luckily it did or else I would have had my friend come and pick me up. I FaceTimed her after and we talked she helped me feel better by joking around but now I’m in bed feeling like an idiot. If you ever see this I’m so sorry 😭😭

**By Grace Samuelson**

https://preview.redd.it/9ptn6xeiq0se1.png?width=560&format=png&auto=webp&s=a69832a59535168f569561433187919543e089a0

It was a little hard, early on a Sunday morning, to think spring when I looked out, past the high snow banks, and saw a deer trotting down Joliet av., evidently lost and hunting a way to get back to familiar haunts.

Seven o’clock; luckily there wasn’t a car on the road. I ran out, past the snowdrifts, and looked to see what became of him. The poor creature had most likely been chased by dogs, and after escaping found no way to get back to his own browsing grounds. He even climbed a drift near Pfiefer’s, looking down on the frozen bay, but must have decided it inaccessible.

The sun shone on his coat as he loped along. I tried to think of a way to help him, but was at a loss. On he went, and when he was out of sight came in the house, wondering what he would do when he encountered traffic. A short time later it began to snow, big ﬂakes coming down for an hour or so. Where was he then? Had he found protection, or was he still a stranger in a strange land? All day the thought haunted me.

When I came back in the house I turned on Charles Kuralt’s “Sunday Morning”; I watched him speak to Walter Cronkite in Jerusalem, and heard the report of President Carter’s meeting with foreign powers, and his feature on a craftsman. Then as he remarked that it was snowing in New York, he said they’d show us pictures of how spring came in Georgia that week. Lovely views, precious glimpses of baby lambs, pigs, geese, ducks and chickens, horses, cows and other farm creatures, aware that spring was in the air there. Tractors plowing the land, lovely flowers and blooming shrubs: color everywhere; a true breath of spring. You could almost smell the flowers.

Then you looked out the window and there were the same dirty snowbanks, with their dirty underwear showing underneath the new snow-white dress! Now there’s water standing on the ice in the bay, yet the promise of a big snow storm again tonight. Just what we don’t need. It’s been a long, tough winter. C’mon spring! We want you.

Someone has said that a late spring reminds one of the way little children dawdle when they don’t want to go to bed: “Just a drink of water, I forgot my prayers, I just want to see the end of that story, or, I’m hungry.” Mother Nature dawdles, too; Spring may come March 21st, by the calendar, but she’s short on promises, and winter gets in some last licks. One day the thermometer may reach the forties; we hear the call of the cardinal and see geese flying north. Then, a sleet storm or a good old fashioned blizzard comes to reminds us it’s too early to remove our heavies, and we feel our boots have grown to our feet. Spring floods; sap running in the maples; water standing on the ice of the bay. Winter-weary appetites yearn for spring vegetables, available now in the store as they never were in the “good old days”. Only now inflationary prices raise a barrier to our budget meals. Like a Pied Piper, the thought of spring leads us a merry chase. Mother Nature’s broom, the wind, is housecleaning the land. Then, after flirting with us awhile, Spring gives us the cold shoulder. We recall the giant in the fairy tale whose icy grip on the land kept the “three ice-men” (as the Germans used to say) bringing frosty coverings to the bare trees. We’ll have to wait. In time there’ll be the Spring symphony.

Take heart. St. Patrick’s Day came again. Remember how we looked forward to it when we were in school? Halfway through Lent, it was always a time for parties, a great day for the Irish. In Ireland it is a quiet time, a religious holiday, but here the descendants from the Emerald Isle celebrate in style: parades, and meals featuring corned beef and cabbage, or good old Irish stew. Shamrocks, clay pipes, shilleghies: (those blackthorn clubs), Pat and Mike jokes, talk of the “ould” country were all in evidence. We had “Mad Hatter” parties, heard a lot of the March Hare, we dressed potato lads and lassies for party decorations. Sometimes we planted grass seed on clay Irish-heads, which soon sprouted green hair. We played all our Irish records on the Victrola: “I’ll Take You Home Again, Kathleen”, “Danny Boy”, and “Wearing of the Green.” Some brave souls wore orange ribbons to school, to show that their ancestors came from North Ireland. We welcomed the hot-cross buns, spicy and loaded with currants, with frosting crosses on the top.

Our own breath of spring came early this March, when our daughter Ruth and three of her children drove up to see us and brought the harbinger of spring — pussywillows, from her back yard. The rains came, but Stanley got the haircut he needed (Ruth did a good styling job) and he got out to a store for the first time since Christmas. Then Kathy, who was back home from a year as an A.F.S. student in New Zealand, showed us slides of that beautiful country, and shared some of her experiences with us. She had come from balmy summer weather down there to the worst blizzard of the season when she landed at O’Hare Field. Her plane was the last flight in, and they said the drive home to Edgerton was truly a nightmare. I thought of trips home via train, and how our schedules were set. We would arrive from Milwaukee at 2 a.m. in Green Bay, sit dozing on those wooden benches in the Northwestern depot till about six, when the Green Bay and Western left for Sturgeon Bay. We felt that the extra time this gave us for our spring vacation was worth it.

Spring vacations in the twenties! We hiked out to “the bluffs” hoping to find a bit of arbutus, those beautiful pink cup-like flowers, well hidden under the leaves; sometimes even under patches of snow. Another hike took us out to the big creek to see if the suckers were running, carrying along a sandwich and an apple, for our first picnic lunch of the year. We watched for robins and bob-o-links, red-wing blackbirds, and spied skunk cabbage, a true sign of spring. Gardeners would dig in last year’s garden to get parsnips (“Sparsnips”, one old lady used to call them.) We believed that parsnips were poison if they hadn’t stayed in the ground over winter. It was too early for dandelion greens but we carried home pussywillows and at school the primary children wrote little poems about the “pussies” and then pasted the catkins on pictures of fences or ladders for display above the blackboard. You felt like prisoners of winter set loose, and even when the Frost King took over again, you had had that interval of freedom.

Looking through old almanacs, I was impressed with the difference in the type of household hints then and now. Like rubbing a cut lemon on spots on the zinc table top. And cleaning the wall paper with a chunk of stale bread, using kerosene and turpentine and vinegar as a furniture polish. Of course, we realize that in those days everything had to start from scratch, there were no processed or ready-prepared foods in the stores. You ate root vegetables stored in the cellar to get your vitamins and took the hateful cod liver oil, or a spring tonic, if you were lack-a-daisical. Some folks found that the old time tonics made them feel so good they bought it by the case. Remember **Hadicol**? Even some strict temperance people never realized the high alcoholic content. They claimed it was a wonderful cure-all. Better than sulphur and molasses.

At our house, spring fever affected us in various ways. Mama cooked up a storm, only instead of soups and stews and Johnny cakes, which she turned out in blizzard weather, now she was inclined to make Jello or Dandy pudding, potato salads, boil a ham without cooking cabbage, and she experimented with various kinds of yeast. There were hops, Yeast Foam, and, finally, Baker’s yeast, which enabled her to make bread or rolls in a few hours, instead of having to set it over-night. When we learned to cook at home we were instructed to run down cellar and get eggs from the water-glass, as our chickens didn’t lay eggs in cold weather. (When my mother first heard that the poultry raisers installed electricity in the chicken houses so that the hens would lay more eggs, she was quite indignant. “Why, mercy sakes!” she scolded, “That’s tampering with nature! Can’t they even let the chickens rest?”) But the people who raised poultry didn’t ask Mother’s advice. They were concerned about making a profit.

Every self-respecting young woman learned to cook, though often it was a case of the mother standing beside her giving instructions, then taking over because she didn’t do it the way Mama did. We used recipes from the Moravian cookbook, the Congregational cookbook, and the Ephraim cookbook. Most of the recipes were sent by women our mothers knew personally. Some “receipts” were ones that Mama knew by heart: her favorites. Measurements were rather indefinite: flour enough to stiffen; a coffee cup of clabbered (sour) milk; a handful of raisins, a pinch of salt, or heaping tablespoons of lard, a scant one of soda. If your coffee cup, or tablespoon was larger or smaller than Mrs. Smith’s, the cake didn’t turn out well. Usually Mama baked a little sample cake in a jar cover. But sample or no, I never saw one of Mam’s cakes go to a church supper without a tiny corner cut out to be sure it was light enough. Great-Aunt Effie’s recipe for molasses-apple cup cakes must have been one she knew “by heart”. I never found it written, and my efforts were soggy failures.

With much snow on the ground, it was too early to start spring housecleaning; every good housewife aimed to be all through with that before Easter. Roller skates, jump ropes, marbles, coaster wagons and bikes waited until the sidewalks were dry before we took them out. No parties during Lent, (except the 17th) and time left for homework **and** re-reading favorite books, listening to stories our parents told about the good old days. Waiting, listening, longing. Then, suddenly it’s spring! Think spring! It’s coming sometime!

 My usual masculine 'doing' energy is in overdrive and I am very assertive and have an awful habit of talking over others recently just because I feel so chaotic ans stressed inside! 

I really want to relax into my feminine receptive energy as I have great people around me but I can't accept help or compliments etc . I know the people giving these small acts of help would love for me to accept it. Even if someone opens a door for me I will tell them to please go first... silly things like that! Or not allowing friends to pay for my coffee when they arrive to a place first (even though I would get the next one). 

Life is really good, but it's busy. I would love to just sloooowwww the pace down inside and not be in such a rush
 Life is beautiful and I want to enjoy it! 

I'd love to take the time for more self care, especially bathing with candles and moisturising after then doing skincare, but I don't feel relaxed enough to do that / am not motivated to do it probably cause of my cortisol levels!

I practice yoga a lot, and it really does help, but only for the 24 hours after. If I don't go for 2 days, I don't feel calm, soft and receptive.


TLDR - I'm far too assertive and want to stop being this way. How to be soft, feminine and receptive living in a big city with a stressful job. ",23,1743423971.0,selfcare,7,0.87,False

1jo1w7w,https://www.reddit.com/r/kratom_infoline/comments/1jo1w7w/is_kratom_good_for_your_brain/,Is Kratom Good for Your Brain?,"Kratom is often used for its effects on mood, focus, and overall brain function. Some users find it helpful, while others experience mixed results. Let’s explore how kratom may impact the brain.

**Potential Benefits of Kratom for the Brain**

1. **Boosts Mood**: Many users report that kratom helps improve their mood and provides a sense of well-being. Certain strains, like White and Green Vein, may promote feelings of happiness and motivation.
2. **Enhances Focus and Energy**: At lower doses, kratom may act like a stimulant, helping with focus and mental clarity. It is sometimes used as a natural alternative to coffee for staying alert.
3. **May Reduce Stress and Anxiety**: Some [strains](https://kratominfoline.com/types-of-kratom-strains/), especially Red Vein, are known for their calming effects, which may help in reducing stress and anxiety. Many people use kratom for relaxation after a long day.
4. **Possible Support for Cognitive Function**: Some users claim that kratom helps them think more clearly and process information better. However, more research is needed to confirm these effects scientifically.

**Potential Risks to Consider**

* **Dependency and Tolerance**: Regular use may lead to dependence, meaning you might need higher doses over time to feel the same effects.
* **Brain Fog in High Doses**: While small doses may boost focus, larger doses can cause drowsiness and make thinking feel slow or unclear.
* **Lack of Scientific Research**: There are limited studies on kratom’s long-term effects on brain health, so it’s essential to use it cautiously.

**Final Thoughts**

Kratom may offer benefits for mood, focus, and relaxation, but its effects can vary from person to person. It’s important to start with a low dose and pay attention to how your body reacts. If you have any medical concerns, consulting a healthcare professional before using kratom is always a good idea.",1,1743423791.0,kratom_infoline,0,1.0,False
1jo1w5o,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jo1w5o/aio/,AIO,"Some back story stuff: 
1) I'm vegetarian 
2) I don't think what happend it's that serious, but my bf was curious about what people would say lol.
3) This dude (let's call him Karen) in my class LOVES to make fun of minorities (homophobic jokes, racist jokes) - so I already didn't like him - and made fun of my ex school (an art school) by Saying:
""Did people had pronouns? Ahahahah""
""How many people had blue hair ahahahaha"" so funny and original, right?
4) I never made fun of Karen, actually I never talked to him before he just decided to start making fun of me.

A couple of times he overreacted to MY diet.
- exhibit A:
I was talking to my friends (NOT TO HIM) about a guy who didn't like coffe and this guy is from Naples (the city of coffe in Italy, like, the God of coffee lives there) and I said ""a Neapolitan guy that doesn't drink coffee?"" And my friend said ""a girl from the south of Italy that's vegetarian?"" (Not a common thing there) And we were all laughing because it is kinda hilarious. Karen bitch comes in the conversation and is like: ""YOU'RE VEGETARIANNNN????!!!!! THAT'S CRAZY! WERE YOU TRAUMATIZED BY MEAT WHEN YOU WERE A KID? DID YOUR PARENTS BEAT YOU WITH A STEAK? WHY IN THE WORLD WOULD YOU BE VEGETARIAN?! -and goes on about my diet…"" (didn't exaggerated his tone, I promise) I didn't react to this because it was only the first time and in general I don't really care about bullys.
- exhibit B:
We were in class and I was saying that I hate the smell of e-cigs because they kinda smell like farts (bean smeell farts) and I can't stand that smell. Karen goes:
""You don't like cigarettes but you eat that super processed fake vegan meat?""
I didn't laugh. (Never laugh at someone who is trying to make fun of you)
And he went: ""are you touchy?""
And I said ""yes."" Than threw (not too hard and not at his face) a pen at him, just to let my anger out a bit 💀
1) his comment had no fucking sense, where is the connection between cigarettes smelling and fake meat? Just say you're OBSESSED with what I eat dude.
2) I don't eat that stuff like most veg people I eat it maybe once in a while. Just like you (omnivore people) eat fast food stuff once in a while. It's normal.
3) meat is also very much processed 
4) I'm not vegan but he's probably too stupid to understand the difference.

1jo1vd6,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenAdvice/comments/1jo1vd6/i_have_a_crush_on_a_coworker/,i have a crush on a co-worker,"hi, I am asking for genuine advice, please, I hope that you do not judge me badly. I have been contemplating about posting this to ask, because I want to give it some time and not assume it to be something else when it's not. But here I am now because I cannot stop thinking about them from time to time. 

I have a crush on a co-worker. He's(35M) older than me by at least 10-14 years. I cannot state the exact age; I am too afraid they will find out about this. We'll call him X. He's into games, just like I do, but we both play different genres. I also don't think we have anything in common, besides the gaming part, but even so, haha, we don't play together. Of course I want to know him more, but I don't know how to go about it. He looks stoic most of the time (not dissing him), and he's quite locked-in at work for the most part.   
  
I first noticed him at work when he was walking back to his desk with his coffee. I said hi, and he raised his brows, and said hi back. For a man like him, I think he's quite youthful - in terms of sharing his joy and what makes him happy. (maybe I just haven't met a lot of older men, ignorant to how they usually behave.) I hit off with guys well in general, not bragging but I think it's due to the course of study, I used to study engineering and hung out with a bunch of boys, it's very chill and we're solid buddies and I've never seen them in that way. But with X, it's different, I find it even hard to look at him or talk to him properly. Yet with other co-workers at work (mostly male), who are also older than me by 10-14 years, I hit off with them quite okay, it's very chill. As cliche as this sounds, when I see X smile, it gives me this warm fuzzy feeling, and whenever I am around him, I can't help but smile/giggle, which always ends up bad for me because I'd bite my lip/pinch myself very hard to stop. And when he talks to other co-workers during lunch, I will pay attention to the topic even though I am not very sure what they're talking about. When X starts sharing the things that bring him joy, I'd smile because of his excitement. He's a nice person; he is usually quiet except when someone starts engaging in a topic he knows well about. I tried hanging out with my friends, focusing on my work and gaming, but I can't help but to think of X from time to time. I'm also sorry if this is lewd but there have been times when my daydreams will get out of control, and I will end up flustered even thinking about him in that inappropriate way. Though, I am pretty sure X only views me as a child despite my age, and probably just another co-worker.   
  
So my issue now is:   
1. How do I know X more without freaking him out?   
2. Should I ignore this crush because of the age gap?   
3. Will a 35 yo guy look at me (23F) in that light? 

ps. I'm sorry if it seems messy, my thoughts are all over the place. But thank you for reading. ",0,1743423715.0,AskMenAdvice,22,0.5,False

1jo1tnz,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1jo1tnz/my_mother_always_acted_like_my_place_was_hers/,My mother always acted like my place was hers,"Saw a dumb tiktok about someone coming home and her mother decorated her whole apartment with cheap, ugly things - that sounds judgemental but I think most people would agree it was really, really bad.

And it’s stupid, but I read the comments and most people found it endearing, they felt bad for the mother, she meant well.

I don’t know, maybe it isn’t always concerning. But my mother did this to every room and place I lived in, until I was 34. She knew exactly what she could get away with, how to make control and not letting your child have agency look like being a really good, involved mother.

It clearly still affects me that my mother’s cover clearly works very well. People still go: that’s so cute, she’s just trying to help. When my mother came to visit when I moved out, she only came to rearrange my furniture. She’d walk in and start dragging a closet to the other side of the room. Her shitty boyfriend would make me feel guilty when she brought things I didn’t want. I didn’t just have to be grateful, I had to feel guilty, for getting things I hated. For my bed suddenly being in a different place. For not being able to find anything. For her going through personal things. For her criticizing everything.

In my early 20s I got a new place and worked so hard to make it perfect, and I worked extra hard for when my mother came to visit - I thought I could prevent her from being who she was by doing that. Of course she walked in and immediately began moving my dining table. (It’s slowly beginning to make me laugh now, which I feel is a victory) She’d never sit down, have a coffee, talk to me, say my place looks nice, how was I doing, nothing, not a word. She just walked in and criticized everything and took control and didn’t talk to me. While I stood there, awkwardly, uncomfortably.

And that time, it broke me. I’d worked so hard, and it had made no difference. No compliments, only critique, and then all my hard work was undone before my eyes. For the first time I told her to stop. And I didn’t back down when she didn’t listen. What did that lead to? An insane temper tantrum, crying, yelling, and then she stormed out. Leaving a mess she’d created. Then she told everyone I’d been mean to her, dramatic, I’d picked a fight for no reason. She was like a toddler, upset I wouldn’t let her paint on the walls - my walls.

Years later, she didn’t remember her behaviour, of course. She only remembered I’d been mean and too sensitive and difficult.

I always cared about my surroundings, but maybe all of this made it more intense. I’m an artist, I care about how things look, a lot. She’d always say that: you’re so particular, you have a specific taste(doesn’t everyone?). I also have OCD - surprise, as a result of the lack of control as a child. And I’m pissed off now that she pointed at these things as the problem. As if I was the weird one for wanting to be in charge in my own place. Everyone has the right to be in control of their space. Everyone gets to have boundaries and privacy.

I’m no contact, and there are still so many moments where I notice how my brain’s been programmed. The last time she came over, she wanted to look in the drawers in my bedroom - obviously probably the most private place in anyone’s home. I had to stand in front of them to stop her. I still have to remind myself that I can have private things, I don’t have to figure out clever ways to hide everything. Because I don’t have to fear anyone looking through it.

Sometimes I’m shocked my furniture is still in the same place when I wake up. It was always chaos with her. Growing up, she’d move the furniture constantly, wanted to paint another wall, remove a door, redo the kitchen, you never knew what you’d wake up to or come home to. And the fact that that continued in what should’ve been my safe spaces once I moved out means I never felt settled and safe. Now, I love that nothing moves, only very occasionally - and then it’s my choice. I know exactly where everything is, I have breakfast in the same place every day, I can count on my apartment to be there, as I left it. I can breathe.

I also hid my diaries very well, and all my books about trauma & abuse & sex. Before she same over, I’d scan my books to see if there was anything I needed to hide. I remember hiding ‘I’m Glad My Mom Died’ the last time. I didn’t want the looks, comments, criticism, gossip to the rest of the family. It genuinely makes me emotional that all my books are on display now. I don’t feel scared, ashamed.

And in the first months of NC I constantly looked at my apartment through her eyes - what would she criticize, how could I prevent being judged. A crack in the wall, a stain in the carpet, a tiny bit of mess, I looked at it as if I was her. Felt the shame, because that’s what I needed to feel to protect myself.

And then in the middle of doing that, I’d suddenly remember I didn’t have to. And the weight off my shoulders in that moment, jesus. The relief, the joy. Now I’ve intentionally not fixed some things just because I can. To tell my brain I’m safe. My apartment is mine, and any place I’ll move to will be mine, it’s finally over.",12,1743423563.0,raisedbynarcissists,3,1.0,False

Finally took that long due and awaited trip to disconnect from you, and hit that “reset button”
Weather been playing a roller coaster! The food, can’t even get enough 😭! People and sightseeing have been my second fav things since I got here. 

Well, all that being said, I’m still thinking, hey! Why not make an awesome friend from Reddit 😆 One more try after all the failures? Call it optimistic or call it whatever lol. Either way, I’d love to connect, get to know someone, talk plenty or even text! I’ll be going back to my own time zone soon but we can still make time to chat whenever you’re available! 

Some of my interests and probably in this particular order: 

Italian coffee (Lavazza & illy)— if you know either then stop right here and slide in my DM now. I’m not asking, I’m telling you haha. 

Good books/reads, hiking, the beach any day of the year! Traveling when I can and of course good food/fine dining. 

Pistachio ice cream/gelato! 

Football/soccer: The English Premier League ♥️— Blessing to humanity, LaLiga— was my top fav, and the “Farmers League”: Ligue 1 (French league for those who don’t get the joke, haha— sorry Madames et Messieurs  lol). 

I love me a new bestie with good, lovely energy, great vibes, educated, well cultured, mature (any age as long as old enough to drink), intelligent, funny if possible, charming — a tiny bit— but I never resist a good amount of charm and more importantly someone who can actually carry a conversation and keep it going past five minutes! Yes! That’s a record on here haha. 

I suppose this would be plenty for now, and one more thing; I love learning about new cultures and languages, so you can always be my linguistics tutor if all else fails, even if you’re second language is “sailor language/slang” jk! lol

If you enjoyed my post please give it a thumbs up and a follow.. (kidding obviously) — you read all the way the through then you might as well hit me up at this point! 

Cheers 

Your tall, tanned and handsome new bestie

Weirdly over time, it’s like my body has worked up a reverse tolerance and the same thing that happened with coffee eventually is happening to me with matcha 😭 does this happen to anyone else??",5,1743423295.0,adhdwomen,5,1.0,False

I’d pay more than 10.99/lb for organic, fair trade, locally owned, and/or locally ground (because remember this? https://www.foodandwine.com/cockroaches-in-coffee-8674033).

Maybe the price before was under market value? How much is everyone paying for coffee?
