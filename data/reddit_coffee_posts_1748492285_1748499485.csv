Age: 29+
Weight: ~69kg
Height: 156cm
Medications: sertraline and venlafaxine for mood
Smoker ~7-10 sticks a day

Sorry for the long post/formatting.

Timeline (to make it easier to understand):

19 May: migraine started around 6pm, took naproxen
20 May: around 1pm had super intense squeezing pain in my head like it‚Äôs going to explode, took naproxen at 2pm, 5pm and 9pm - took the edge off but still hurts
21 May: still in pain, neck pain started, had an unrelated medical appointment and mentioned to the doctor who prescribed sumatriptan (did not work) also tried going to the gym (also did nothing to help)
22 May: intense pain again + light and sound sensitivity, GP doctor prescribed arcoxia 120mg for the pain and to try Properazine if that doesn‚Äôt work (helps with migraine?) told to rest
23 May: still in pain, texted my GP doctor who told me to try celebrex - took the edge off but still hurts
24 May: went to another GP clinic, told to try anarex and referred to neuro. Went home tried both cold and hot compress for neck - no relief
25 May: couldn‚Äôt turn my neck. tried tcm - gua Sha, tui na, acupuncture - made it worse? Left side started hurting
26 May: still in pain, can feel neck and shoulder‚Äôs muscle relaxed (probably from tui na + anarex) but aside from that the specific spot in my neck is still hurting, took naproxen just to see if it works now - didn‚Äôt work
27 May: couldn‚Äôt take it and saw my GP again, he prescribed metoclorpramide, 30~mins later there was 0 change then he prescribed atenolol (0.5 tab 50mg). After 1+ hours still no relief + started getting chest tightness (likely due to atenolol) so he told me to go to the ER.
At the ER: the doctor gave tramadol + something else (I think it‚Äôs paracetamol) and sent me for a CT brain scan + some blood work (FBC and renal panel??). According to the doctor, CT was normal, blood work was also normal other than a slightly elevated creatinine. They kept me for observation overnight and repeated the renal panel in the morning, creatinine still slightly elevated. A senior consultant came by and maneuvered my head (up down left right) asking if there was pain. I told him it hurt a little when he pushed my head down and to the left. He told me that ‚Äúthere‚Äôs no brain inflammation. It‚Äôs likely just a headache. Could be migraine or cluster headache but we can‚Äôt be sure so we will refer you to the specialist to follow up. Just take some painkillers and rest‚Äù I told him that painkillers were not working that‚Äôs why I was there and he turned to ask the other Dr what I had been given. That Dr just told him what the ER had given me and I said I had taken other painkillers before coming to the ER. I listed all the meds I tried then the consultant said ‚Äúwell, different people react differently to painkillers. Need to find the right one for it to work‚Äù. Dr proceeded to prescribe paracetamol, ibuprofen and omeprazole and discharged me. It took me talking to the nurse who then went to ask the Dr why he prescribed meds that didn‚Äôt work and he decided to change it to a migraine med.
When at the pharmacy, I realised it was caffox which I can‚Äôt take due to the intense side effects (giddiness until I can‚Äôt walk, vomiting) and it didn‚Äôt work when I tried it previously. Dr refused to change it so I just declined it and left.
28 May: after leaving the hospital I dropped by my GP clinic because my doctor found samples for rimegepant and told me to try it. It did alleviate the headache but not the neck pain.
29 May (today): neck pain still insanely persistent, hurts to move especially tilting my head down.

Medical history:
IBS? 
On sertraline and venlafaxine for mood
Usually have migraines few days before my period/randomly
Usually have low BP (90/60~) HR was in the 50s and dipped to 40s at the ER
Don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs important by my grandfather passed from liver cancer

Full list of meds tried:
Naproxen 275mg
Sumatriptan
Properazine
Arcoxia 120mg
Celebrex
Anarex
Metoclorpramide
Atenolol
Paracetamol
Tramadol
Rimegepant

Also tried:
Coffee
No coffee
Exercise
Rest
Hot and cold compress
Massage
Acupuncture

I‚Äôm at my wits end. It hurts so bad honestly I‚Äôd rather die right now. The specific spot is at the base of my skull where it connects to the neck on the right side. My GP doctor can‚Äôt do much and could only advise me to take some painkillers and massage the area. I don‚Äôt know if the ER Dr wrote me off due to my low BP (I know pain increases BP) or I just didn‚Äôt look like I‚Äôm in pain. The pain fluctuates between 10/10 when it‚Äôs super intense to like a 2-3/10 when it‚Äôs more dull/muted but never truly gone. Can anyone help?",1,1748499326.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

I am a cat rescuer based in Bahrain that is sending cats through Whiskers without borders for my rescue cats to be adopted out through Whiskers and Wine an amazing cat cafe that finds well vetted adopters for rescue cats in San Diego as well as now, Bahrain.

Gretel was due to fly in May, however due to a tail injury she had to be taken off the flight. We send 8 cats at a time and so we gave the fund raised amount to another kitty called Button who was also travel ready to go in her place.

Gretel is planning to fly in the end of June, but only if we once again reach her fundraising goal.

Would you mind sending some love and perhaps the price of a morning coffee to support her in getting there?

Also, if you are based in or near San Diego do check out Whiskers and Wine! They are doing a tremendous job and has really shone a light of hope by giving us relief to our rescue efforts are adopters here can't be trusted and are close to none.

Breeding is out of control in Bahrain, the government does not TNR so it is up individual rescuers like to me to be somewhat of a band-aid to the suffering cats of the country.

Thanks for reading this post and here is the link to Gretel's gofundme:

Classic, right? üåÇüòÇ

Just as I was wrestling it back into submission, a guy waiting nearby chuckled and said, ""Looks like the wind's got a bit of a crush on you today!""

I couldn't help but laugh. ""Either that or it's trying to send me flying home early!""

We both laughed, and before I knew it, we were chatting away about how this crazy spring weather seems to have a personality crisis every other day. It was one of those brief, sweet moments that warms your heart like a sunny day emerging after a rainstorm.

When the bus finally arrived, he gave a mock salute with his coffee cup, ""Safe travels in umbrella land!"" and just like that, the bus doors closed, leaving me with a smile and a bit of restored faith in those unexpected human connections...

1ky3fqs,https://i.redd.it/nr87pm9kwn3f1.jpeg,The Therapy Room (OC Story),"Har insaan ke dimaag mein kuch darr chhupa hota hai. Par mere paas log apna darr leke aate hain‚Ä¶ aur chhod jaate hain.

Mera naam Dr. Subhashree Bose hai. Lekin poora sheher mujhe Dr. SubbRee ke naam se jaanta hai. Main ek psychologist hoon. Main un dimaag ke raazon mein ghusne ki koshish karta hoon jahan aksar log khud bhi jaana nahi chahte.

Main samajhta hoon ki har case ek kahaani hoti hai‚Äîkisi ki tooti hui kahaani, kisi ka dabaa hua sach. Lekin uss din jo case mere saamne aaya, woh meri soch se pare tha.

Subah 9:47 AM, clinic ke reception pe Anju aayi bhaagti hui. Uske chehre pe wahi hamesha wali urgency thi, lekin aankhon mein kuch aur tha‚Äîhalka sa darr.

""Sir, ek naya case aaya hai. Parents bahut pareshan hain. Bachha... thoda alag hai,"" usne kaha.

Main apna coffee ka cup table pe rakha aur clinic room ke taraf chala gaya. Room ke andar jaate hi meri nazar uss ladke pe padi.

Naam tha uska Aaryan Tiwari. Patla, 15 saal ka ladka. Baalon mein uljhan thi, jaise kai din se kangi nahi kiya. Chehra zard tha, aankhon ke neeche kale daag aur aankhon mein... woh khaali pan tha jo sirf un logon mein hota hai jo ya toh kuch kho chuke hain... ya khud ko.

Usne mujhe dekha. Seedha aankhon mein. Mujhe laga jaise mere dimaag ke andar tak dekh raha ho.

""Doctor,"" usne dheere se kaha, ""Unhe mat sunna. Main pagal nahi hoon. Woh mujhe bulaate hain.""

Uske maa-baap ne kaha ki pehle toh bas chup rehta tha, lekin fir ajeeb harkatein shuru ho gayi. Raat ko chhilana, deewar pe kuch symbols banana. Ek hi design baar baar. Ghar mein sab dar gaye.

""Hume laga bhoot-pret ka mamla hai,"" Aaryan ki maa roti hui boli. ""Pandit bulaaye, havan karwaye, lekin koi faayda nahi hua. Bas yeh aur zyada ajeeb hota gaya.""

Main usse poochta gaya basic questions. Naam, school, friends... har sawaal ka jawab usne de diya, lekin uske jawaabon mein ek ajeeb sa rhythm tha. Jaise woh kuch yaad karke bol raha ho, ya koi script pad raha ho.

Phir maine usse poocha, ""Yeh symbols kyu banate ho Aaryan?""

Usne haath se hawa mein ek spiral banaya, muskuraya aur bola, ""Woh chahte hain main darwaza kholun.""

Darwaza?¬† Maine pucha. 

Uske baap ne kaha, ""Yeh raat bhar baith ke ek hi symbol banata hai... ek aankh, ek chakra... aur kehata hai ki woh andar se baat karte hain.""

Uski notebook maine uthayi. Har page pe wahi pattern. Ek spiral jiska beech mein ek aankh bani thi. Har spiral ka radius alag, par design ek hi. Mujhe kuch jaana-pehchaana laga.

Clinic ke store room mein meri ek purani diary padhi thi‚Äîinternship ke dino ki. Maine wahan dekha tha wohi spiral. Ek patient banata tha woh. Us patient ka naam... nahi yaad aa raha.

Us din shaam tak main sirf uske symbols ko dekhte raha. Har ek line, har ek curve jaise mere dimaag mein kuch trigger kar rahi thi. Ek deja vu, ek chhupi hui yaad jise main khud bhool chuka tha.

Raat ko main late nikla. Clinic ke bahar car mein baithte hi mujhe Aaryan ki ek line yaad aayi:

""Aapke andar bhi toh koi bolta hai na, Doctor?""

Tab mujhe laga... yeh ladka sirf patient nahi hai. Shayad yeh mere past ka ek tukda leke aaya hai. Ya fir woh darwaza jise maine kab ka band kar diya tha... ab khulne jaa raha hai.

Maine Aaryan ko next session ke liye bula liya. Par is baar main zyada taiyaar tha. Room mein CCTV laga diye the, voice recorder on kiya aur apni diary nikaal ke saamne rakhi‚Äîjahaan har patient ki detail likhta hoon.

Aaryan aaya toh uska chehra pehle se zyada udaas tha. Uski aankhein jaise neend ke sagar mein doobi hui thi. Jaise raat bhar kisi ne usse sone hi nahi diya ho.

""Doctor, aapko bhi dikhte hain na? Jab aap aankhein band karte ho?"" usne bina kisi intro ke poocha.

Main hairaan tha. ""Kya dikhte hain Aaryan?""

Usne dheere se kaha, ""Wahi... aankh... spiral... aur ek awaaz. Jaise koi cheekh raha ho... lekin aankhon ke andar.""

Uske bolne ka andaaz mujhe uncomfortable kar raha tha. Na jaane kyun, meri khud ki chaati pe bojh mehsoos hone laga tha. Jaise main sirf uska therapist nahi, uska part ban raha hoon.

Maine usse ek drawing sheet di. ""Banake dikhao Aaryan, jo tum dekhte ho.""

Usne spiral banaya. Lekin is baar spiral ke andar ek naam likha: ""Shunya.‚Äù

Mera haath kaanp gaya. Shunya... mujhe woh naam kuch yaad dila raha tha. Kuch purana. Bahut hi purana. Internship ke time ek ladka tha jise sab 'silent boy' kehte the. Woh bhi yeh spiral banata tha... aur wahi naam likhta tha.

Main raat ko apne study room mein purani files nikalta raha. Paper, notes, audio tapes. Aur ek file mili‚ÄîPatient #108: Rishi Sen. Spiral pattern. Delusional ideation. Hallucination. Aur ek note‚Äî""Claims a force called Shunya speaks through him.""

Mera sir ghoom gaya. Yeh coincidence nahi ho sakta.

Agli subah Aaryan ke pitaji clinic aaye. Unka chehra pe tension tha.

""Doctor sahab, Aaryan raat ko fir se bhaag gaya. Bathroom ke sheeshe pe usne apna khoon se woh spiral banaya. Police bhi kuch nahi keh pa rahi. Hum thak gaye hain. Aap hi kuch karo.""

Us raat maine CCTV footage dekha. Aaryan kamre mein akele baitha tha. Lekin uska reflection... uska reflection kuch alag tha. Jab Aaryan muskuraya, reflection ne nahi kiya. Jab usne haath uthaya, reflection ne kuch aur kiya.

Mera rom-rom khada ho gaya.

Kya yeh sab Aaryan ke dimaag ka khel hai? Ya mere khud ke hosh ka?

Ya shayad... yeh case mujhe wapas us andhere mein le jaa raha hai jahan se main kabhi nikla hi nahi tha.

Agli subah clinic mein ek ajeeb si khamoshi thi. Main apne chamber mein baitha tha, lekin dimaag mein sirf woh CCTV footage chal rahi thi. Aaryan ka reflection... woh reflection jisme kuch alag tha, Jaise koi aur uske andar se jhaank raha ho.

Maine apne assistant se kaha, ""Clinic mein koi bhi sheesha hata do. Aaj se sab patients se sirf open glass mein baat hogi.""

Woh hairaan thi, par maine zyada sawal uthane ka mauka nahi diya. Main khud nahi samajh pa raha tha ki darr mujhe Aaryan se lag raha tha... ya iss halaat se.

Usi din dopahar Aaryan wapas aaya. Iss baar uske haath mein ek purani diary thi. Bina kuch bole usne diary mere samne rakh di.

""Yeh meri nahi hai,"" usne kaha. ""Yeh mere sapno mein aati thi. Main sirf likhta gaya.""

Diary ke pages pe likha tha- ""They think I'm mad. But I'm only the vessel. Shunya is the voice. Shunya is the truth. Shunya is freedom.""

Aur har dusre page par wahi spiral, har baar thoda aur complex, thoda aur gehra.

Main diary padhta gaya, aur har page ke saath meri dhadkan tez hoti gayi. Har ek line jaise meri soch se khel rahi thi. Jaise woh likha gaya tha... mere liye.

Tabhi phone aaya. Aaryan ke school se. ""Doctor, we need to talk urgently. Something's happened in the boy's washroom.""

Main turant pahucha. Washroom ke andar jaake jo dekha, usne mere pairon ke neeche se zameen khinch li. Deewar pe likha tha: ""Dr. SubbRee, do you see it now?""

Aur neeche wohi spiral. Khoon se likha hua. Us waqt mujhe yaad aaya-Patient #108: Rishi Sen. Usne bhi kuch aisa hi kiya tha. Aur uske baad... woh gayab ho gaya tha. Hospital ke record se, zindagi se, sab jagah se.

Wapas clinic aake maine Aaryan se poocha, ""Tum mujhe kya dikhana chahte ho?""

Usne seedha aankhon mein dekha. ""Jo aap chhupa rahe ho. Jo aap bhool gaye ho.""

""Mujhe yaad dilaao, Aaryan."" Maine pucha.

Usne diary ka ek aur panna khola. Ek photo chipka hua tha. Purani si. Black and white. Ek doctor... aur ek patient. Main us doctor ko pehchaan gaya..

Woh main tha.

Aur patient... woh Rishi nahi tha.

Woh Aaryan tha.

Par yeh kaise ho sakta tha? Yeh photo toh... yeh toh 15 saal purani lag rahi thi.

Clinic lautne ke baad maine diary aur us photo ko baar-baar dekha. Us tasveer mein main tha, lekin 15 saal pehle? Tab toh Aaryan paida bhi nahi hua hoga. Toh yeh photo mein kaise? Mera dimaag goonj raha tha.

Maine raat ko diary ko aur gehraai se padhna shuru kiya. Har ek panna ek naye raaz se bhara tha. Usmein Aaryan ke hone se pehle ki baatein likhi thi. Mere clinic ke patients, unke sessions... aur unke disappear hone ki kahaniyan. Har case ka ek common thread tha‚Äîwoh spiral. Har jagah, har dimaag mein ghusta hua spiral.

Ek page pe likha tha:

""Truth is not remembered. It is buried. But the spiral digs it up.""

Mujhe yaad aane laga... Rishi Sen, patient #108. Usne bhi kuch aise hi cheezein boli thi. Ki woh awaaz sunta hai, ki koi uske andar se bolta hai. Aur jab maine uska ilaaj rokne ki koshish ki, usne wohi spiral banake, clinic ke mirror pe likh diya tha:

‚ÄúDo you see it yet?‚Äù

Kal school mein bhi wahi line thi. Aur ab Aaryan bhi wahi keh raha tha. Toh kya Rishi gayab nahi hua tha? Kya woh kabhi gaya hi nahi tha?

Main diary leke usi raat clinic gaya. Office ke andar purana storage khola. Purane files, audio tapes... sab kuch ulat ke dekhne laga. Tab mujhe ek file mili, jispe naam tha‚ÄîRishi Sen

Aur andar... ek purana audio tape recorder.

Mainne play kiya:

> ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs watching me. Through the glass. Through the spiral. He‚Äôs coming out.‚Äù

Tape mein kuch seconds ke liye sirf static noise thi... phir awaaz badal gayi. Ajeeb si. Jaise kisi aur ki ho.

> ‚ÄúSubbRee... You promised. You locked us in.‚Äù

Meri saansen ruk gayi thi. Awaaz jaise mere dimaag mein seedha ghus rahi thi. Maine tape band kiya, lekin woh awaaz band nahi hui. Clinic ke sheeshe mein mujhe kuch hilta dikha. Main us taraf chala gaya... lekin wahan sirf mera reflection tha.

Ya shayad...

Maine aankhon mein jhaank ke dekha. Aur tab mujhe dikha‚Äîspiral. Meri aankhon ke andar, dheere-dheere ghoomta hua spiral. Jaise meri yaadon ko kheench raha ho.

Ek page pe likha tha:

‚ÄúTo wake up, you must remember the lie you told yourself.‚Äù

Us raat ke baad neend meri aankhon se rooth gayi. Clinic ke sheeshe mein dikhti woh spiral, mere dimaag mein ghoomti rahi. Har baar jab aankh band karta, kuch yaadein flash hoti. Ek kamra... ek bacha... spiral banata hua... aur ek awaaz‚Äîmeri hi awaaz‚Äîlekin alag.

Main diary lekar ghar wapas gaya. Har page ko bariki se padhta gaya, jaise kisi puzzle ka hissa hoon. Har likhi baat, har naam, har jagah... sab kuch jaisa jaana-pehchana laga. Tabhi ek page pe likha mila:

‚ÄúMemory is a parasite. The more you feed it, the less you remain.‚Äù

Clinic ke cameras dekhe. Pichhle kuch dino ke footage check kiye. Jo dikha usne meri rooh kaanp di.

Main hi Aaryan ke saath baith kar session le raha hoon. Par phir angle shift hota hai... aur dikhta hai‚Äîkhaali room. Main akela bol raha hoon. Na Aaryan, na koi patient. Sirf main. Aur woh spiral.

Tab mujhe yaad aaya... Aaryan ka naam maine kahaan suna tha. Apne khud ke file mein. Main kabhi ek patient tha. Dissociative Identity Disorder. Multiple identities. Aur Dr. SubbRee? Woh mera therapist tha. Par jab uska accident hua... maine uski identity apne andar le li.

Woh spiral? Ek symbol tha. Jise Dr. SubbRee mujhe draw karne bolta tha‚Äîto ground myself. Par yeh spiral mujhe aur confuse karta gaya.

Final page pe likha tha:

‚ÄúTo heal, you must let go of the doctor inside you.‚Äù

Main clinic gaya... ussi sheeshe ke saamne khada ho gaya. Sheesha toh main samajh raha tha, par dar asal woh meri haqeeqat ka darwaza tha. Maine spiral ko dekha, fir aankhen band ki. Aur khud se kaha:

""Main patient hoon. Main theek hona chahta hoon.""

Ek aansu tapak ke spiral pe gira... aur sab kuch ruk gaya. Clinic ka reflection hil gaya. Diary jal gayi. Saari aawazein band ho gayi.

Aankhen kholi toh main ek white room mein tha. Actual mental health facility. Samne ek real psychiatrist‚ÄîDr. SubbRee baithe the. Unhone kaha, ""Welcome back, Mr. Subash. You've been under our care for six years. I see you've woken up now""

THE END

""Sach kabhi bura nahi hota... par usse jeena zaroor mushkil hota hai.""

Here's my ranking of five of them, based on the V60 pour-overs I made. I didn‚Äôt try Whistling Schoolboy since I don‚Äôt have a South Indian filter and usually avoid using the Moka Pot.

**1. Jumping Ant (Light)** ‚Äì This was my favourite of the lot (probably because I prefer lighter roasts). The flavour was citrusy and sweet‚Äîvery vibrant. I‚Äôd definitely consider ordering it again. For this, I used a medium-fine grind (around 550 Œºm), 15 grams of coffee with 250 ml of water, at 92¬∞C. I poured in four stages with sufficient agitation.  
  
**2. Otter (Medium Dark)** ‚Äì The only other one from the pack I‚Äôd consider reordering. Despite being on the darker side, it felt balanced and had noticeable sweet notes. It also stood out compared to other medium roasts I‚Äôve tried. What worked best was a medium-coarse grind (around 800 Œºm), 15 grams of coffee with 255 ml of water at 88¬∞C. I used just two pours (including the bloom), and a longer bloom time‚Äîover 60 seconds‚Äîmade a noticeable difference.

**3. Ficus (Medium Dark)** ‚Äì Somewhat similar to Otter, but I didn‚Äôt enjoy it as much (Otter's sweetness worked better for me). I got the best results using Tetsu Kasuya‚Äôs method with four pours, a medium-coarse grind, and a brew temperature of 88¬∞C.

**4. Wanderoo (Medium)** ‚Äì I used the same recipe as for Ficus, but I liked this one less‚Äîperhaps due to its acidity. I wouldn‚Äôt order it again.

**5. Luna (Dark**) ‚Äì I know pour-over isn‚Äôt ideal for darker roasts, but I was determined to make it work. I tried grinding coarser, reducing agitation, and lowering the temperature, but none of it helped much. It was still drinkable, just not compelling. I also tried a French press version with milk once, but that turned out pretty average too. Won‚Äôt be reordering this one.",1,1748498664.0,IndiaCoffee,1,1.0,False

Clinic ke store room mein meri ek purani diary padhi thi‚Äîinternship ke dino ki. Maine wahan dekha tha wohi spiral. Ek patient banata tha woh. Us patient ka naam... nahi yaad aa raha.

Us din shaam tak main sirf uske symbols ko dekhte raha. Har ek line, har ek curve jaise mere dimaag mein kuch trigger kar rahi thi. Ek deja vu, ek chhupi hui yaad jise main khud bhool chuka tha.

Raat ko main late nikla. Clinic ke bahar car mein baithte hi mujhe Aaryan ki ek line yaad aayi:

""Aapke andar bhi toh koi bolta hai na, Doctor?""

Tab mujhe laga... yeh ladka sirf patient nahi hai. Shayad yeh mere past ka ek tukda leke aaya hai. Ya fir woh darwaza jise maine kab ka band kar diya tha... ab khulne jaa raha hai.

Maine Aaryan ko next session ke liye bula liya. Par is baar main zyada taiyaar tha. Room mein CCTV laga diye the, voice recorder on kiya aur apni diary nikaal ke saamne rakhi‚Äîjahaan har patient ki detail likhta hoon.

Aaryan aaya toh uska chehra pehle se zyada udaas tha. Uski aankhein jaise neend ke sagar mein doobi hui thi. Jaise raat bhar kisi ne usse sone hi nahi diya ho.

""Doctor, aapko bhi dikhte hain na? Jab aap aankhein band karte ho?"" usne bina kisi intro ke poocha.

Main hairaan tha. ""Kya dikhte hain Aaryan?""

Usne dheere se kaha, ""Wahi... aankh... spiral... aur ek awaaz. Jaise koi cheekh raha ho... lekin aankhon ke andar.""

Uske bolne ka andaaz mujhe uncomfortable kar raha tha. Na jaane kyun, meri khud ki chaati pe bojh mehsoos hone laga tha. Jaise main sirf uska therapist nahi, uska part ban raha hoon.

Maine usse ek drawing sheet di. ""Banake dikhao Aaryan, jo tum dekhte ho.""

Usne spiral banaya. Lekin is baar spiral ke andar ek naam likha: ""Shunya.‚Äù

Mera haath kaanp gaya. Shunya... mujhe woh naam kuch yaad dila raha tha. Kuch purana. Bahut hi purana. Internship ke time ek ladka tha jise sab 'silent boy' kehte the. Woh bhi yeh spiral banata tha... aur wahi naam likhta tha.

Main raat ko apne study room mein purani files nikalta raha. Paper, notes, audio tapes. Aur ek file mili‚ÄîPatient #108: Rishi Sen. Spiral pattern. Delusional ideation. Hallucination. Aur ek note‚Äî""Claims a force called Shunya speaks through him.""

Mera sir ghoom gaya. Yeh coincidence nahi ho sakta.

Agli subah Aaryan ke pitaji clinic aaye. Unka chehra pe tension tha.

""Doctor sahab, Aaryan raat ko fir se bhaag gaya. Bathroom ke sheeshe pe usne apna khoon se woh spiral banaya. Police bhi kuch nahi keh pa rahi. Hum thak gaye hain. Aap hi kuch karo.""

Us raat maine CCTV footage dekha. Aaryan kamre mein akele baitha tha. Lekin uska reflection... uska reflection kuch alag tha. Jab Aaryan muskuraya, reflection ne nahi kiya. Jab usne haath uthaya, reflection ne kuch aur kiya.

Mera rom-rom khada ho gaya.

Kya yeh sab Aaryan ke dimaag ka khel hai? Ya mere khud ke hosh ka?

Ya shayad... yeh case mujhe wapas us andhere mein le jaa raha hai jahan se main kabhi nikla hi nahi tha.

Agli subah clinic mein ek ajeeb si khamoshi thi. Main apne chamber mein baitha tha, lekin dimaag mein sirf woh CCTV footage chal rahi thi. Aaryan ka reflection... woh reflection jisme kuch alag tha, Jaise koi aur uske andar se jhaank raha ho.

Maine apne assistant se kaha, ""Clinic mein koi bhi sheesha hata do. Aaj se sab patients se sirf open glass mein baat hogi.""

Woh hairaan thi, par maine zyada sawal uthane ka mauka nahi diya. Main khud nahi samajh pa raha tha ki darr mujhe Aaryan se lag raha tha... ya iss halaat se.

Usi din dopahar Aaryan wapas aaya. Iss baar uske haath mein ek purani diary thi. Bina kuch bole usne diary mere samne rakh di.

""Yeh meri nahi hai,"" usne kaha. ""Yeh mere sapno mein aati thi. Main sirf likhta gaya.""

Diary ke pages pe likha tha- ""They think I'm mad. But I'm only the vessel. Shunya is the voice. Shunya is the truth. Shunya is freedom.""

Aur har dusre page par wahi spiral, har baar thoda aur complex, thoda aur gehra.

Main diary padhta gaya, aur har page ke saath meri dhadkan tez hoti gayi. Har ek line jaise meri soch se khel rahi thi. Jaise woh likha gaya tha... mere liye.

Tabhi phone aaya. Aaryan ke school se. ""Doctor, we need to talk urgently. Something's happened in the boy's washroom.""

Main turant pahucha. Washroom ke andar jaake jo dekha, usne mere pairon ke neeche se zameen khinch li. Deewar pe likha tha: ""Dr. SubbRee, do you see it now?""

Aur neeche wohi spiral. Khoon se likha hua. Us waqt mujhe yaad aaya-Patient #108: Rishi Sen. Usne bhi kuch aisa hi kiya tha. Aur uske baad... woh gayab ho gaya tha. Hospital ke record se, zindagi se, sab jagah se.

Wapas clinic aake maine Aaryan se poocha, ""Tum mujhe kya dikhana chahte ho?""

Usne seedha aankhon mein dekha. ""Jo aap chhupa rahe ho. Jo aap bhool gaye ho.""

""Mujhe yaad dilaao, Aaryan."" Maine pucha.

Usne diary ka ek aur panna khola. Ek photo chipka hua tha. Purani si. Black and white. Ek doctor... aur ek patient. Main us doctor ko pehchaan gaya..

Woh main tha.

Aur patient... woh Rishi nahi tha.

Woh Aaryan tha.

Par yeh kaise ho sakta tha? Yeh photo toh... yeh toh 15 saal purani lag rahi thi.

Clinic lautne ke baad maine diary aur us photo ko baar-baar dekha. Us tasveer mein main tha, lekin 15 saal pehle? Tab toh Aaryan paida bhi nahi hua hoga. Toh yeh photo mein kaise? Mera dimaag goonj raha tha.

Maine raat ko diary ko aur gehraai se padhna shuru kiya. Har ek panna ek naye raaz se bhara tha. Usmein Aaryan ke hone se pehle ki baatein likhi thi. Mere clinic ke patients, unke sessions... aur unke disappear hone ki kahaniyan. Har case ka ek common thread tha‚Äîwoh spiral. Har jagah, har dimaag mein ghusta hua spiral.

Ek page pe likha tha:

""Truth is not remembered. It is buried. But the spiral digs it up.""

Mujhe yaad aane laga... Rishi Sen, patient #108. Usne bhi kuch aise hi cheezein boli thi. Ki woh awaaz sunta hai, ki koi uske andar se bolta hai. Aur jab maine uska ilaaj rokne ki koshish ki, usne wohi spiral banake, clinic ke mirror pe likh diya tha:

‚ÄúDo you see it yet?‚Äù

Kal school mein bhi wahi line thi. Aur ab Aaryan bhi wahi keh raha tha. Toh kya Rishi gayab nahi hua tha? Kya woh kabhi gaya hi nahi tha?

Main diary leke usi raat clinic gaya. Office ke andar purana storage khola. Purane files, audio tapes... sab kuch ulat ke dekhne laga. Tab mujhe ek file mili, jispe naam tha‚ÄîRishi Sen

Aur andar... ek purana audio tape recorder.

Mainne play kiya:

> ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs watching me. Through the glass. Through the spiral. He‚Äôs coming out.‚Äù

Tape mein kuch seconds ke liye sirf static noise thi... phir awaaz badal gayi. Ajeeb si. Jaise kisi aur ki ho.

> ‚ÄúSubbRee... You promised. You locked us in.‚Äù

Meri saansen ruk gayi thi. Awaaz jaise mere dimaag mein seedha ghus rahi thi. Maine tape band kiya, lekin woh awaaz band nahi hui. Clinic ke sheeshe mein mujhe kuch hilta dikha. Main us taraf chala gaya... lekin wahan sirf mera reflection tha.

Ya shayad...

Maine aankhon mein jhaank ke dekha. Aur tab mujhe dikha‚Äîspiral. Meri aankhon ke andar, dheere-dheere ghoomta hua spiral. Jaise meri yaadon ko kheench raha ho.

Ek page pe likha tha:

‚ÄúTo wake up, you must remember the lie you told yourself.‚Äù

Us raat ke baad neend meri aankhon se rooth gayi. Clinic ke sheeshe mein dikhti woh spiral, mere dimaag mein ghoomti rahi. Har baar jab aankh band karta, kuch yaadein flash hoti. Ek kamra... ek bacha... spiral banata hua... aur ek awaaz‚Äîmeri hi awaaz‚Äîlekin alag.

Main diary lekar ghar wapas gaya. Har page ko bariki se padhta gaya, jaise kisi puzzle ka hissa hoon. Har likhi baat, har naam, har jagah... sab kuch jaisa jaana-pehchana laga. Tabhi ek page pe likha mila:

‚ÄúMemory is a parasite. The more you feed it, the less you remain.‚Äù

Clinic ke cameras dekhe. Pichhle kuch dino ke footage check kiye. Jo dikha usne meri rooh kaanp di.

Main hi Aaryan ke saath baith kar session le raha hoon. Par phir angle shift hota hai... aur dikhta hai‚Äîkhaali room. Main akela bol raha hoon. Na Aaryan, na koi patient. Sirf main. Aur woh spiral.

Tab mujhe yaad aaya... Aaryan ka naam maine kahaan suna tha. Apne khud ke file mein. Main kabhi ek patient tha. Dissociative Identity Disorder. Multiple identities. Aur Dr. SubbRee? Woh mera therapist tha. Par jab uska accident hua... maine uski identity apne andar le li.

Woh spiral? Ek symbol tha. Jise Dr. SubbRee mujhe draw karne bolta tha‚Äîto ground myself. Par yeh spiral mujhe aur confuse karta gaya.

Final page pe likha tha:

‚ÄúTo heal, you must let go of the doctor inside you.‚Äù

Main clinic gaya... ussi sheeshe ke saamne khada ho gaya. Sheesha toh main samajh raha tha, par dar asal woh meri haqeeqat ka darwaza tha. Maine spiral ko dekha, fir aankhen band ki. Aur khud se kaha:

""Main patient hoon. Main theek hona chahta hoon.""

Ek aansu tapak ke spiral pe gira... aur sab kuch ruk gaya. Clinic ka reflection hil gaya. Diary jal gayi. Saari aawazein band ho gayi.

Aankhen kholi toh main ek white room mein tha. Actual mental health facility. Samne ek real psychiatrist‚ÄîDr. SubbRee baithe the. Unhone kaha, ""Welcome back, Mr. Subash. You've been under our care for six years. I see you've woken up now""

1ky3cj2,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParanormalEncounters/comments/1ky3cj2/i_think_i_pissed_something_off_at_my_moms_house/,I think I pissed something off at my mom‚Äôs house.,"Context: me and my younger brother were visiting my mom for this most recent Memorial Day. Her home is two stories in a nice suburban. She lives with her boyfriend and his daughter and son, plus my baby brother (I have two brothers). Everyone‚Äôs bedroom is on the second floor except for my step sister‚Äôs. For this trip, my brother had an air mattress in my baby brother‚Äôs room and I slept downstairs on a couch in the living room. As we have done many times before. The weekend was super fun, relaxed, and every night I slept peacefully and comfortably‚Ä¶except for the last one‚Ä¶

It was around 1 am. My mom had finished showing me the first two episodes of yellowjackets. Which she is obsessed with. That‚Äôs factor 1. That‚Äôs show is creepy as hell but by no means is it the worst I‚Äôve seen.  Factor 2, I had also smoked weed about 3 hours prior. Also relevant, but I want to convey that I am no stranger to smoking and know when it has worn off. I was DEFINITELY sober by the time we all headed to bed but I want to cover all the facts. It is relevant. 

Everyone except me went upstairs. My step sister was already in bed and had been asleep for a while. I showered, packed my stuff because we were leaving the next morning, and laid down on the couch to scroll on Pinterest and get sleepy. Right about here‚Ä¶.is where I began to feel this off feeling. The room felt‚Ä¶emptier‚Ä¶like there was more space. Like something was missing and I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it. It‚Äôs  not silent. There‚Äôs fish/ turtle tanks with active pumps in the room  and a fan sitting in the coffee table behind my head pointing over me pushing air away from me. and it‚Äôs not dark. Some reptile lights in the room have night mode. (The living room is also the reptile room) 

My point is. It‚Äôs not creepy and I‚Äôm not all alone. And this was the first time I had felt anything like this in this room or in this house in general. Reminder, I had slept just fine the 3 previous nights. Anyway‚Ä¶I‚Äôm laying there‚Ä¶scrolling on my phone, ignoring the off feeling when suddenly I hear 3 distinct loud clicks come from the entrance of the hallway leading to the garage. The best way I can describe it is the clicks someone makes when trying to coax a cat to them. I froze. Fully expecting my sister to walk out of the hallway leading (as it also leads to her room) but nothing happens‚Ä¶.
I then start running down options. What could have made that sound? A faulty light? There was no flickering. An animal? None of the reptiles present have that kind of capability. My sister? Maybe‚Ä¶but what was she doing? Why didn‚Äôt I hear her door? And she‚Äôs been asleep for hours and she is a HEAVY sleeper. Machine? Maybe‚Ä¶but which one‚Ä¶it had never made that noise before????
I want to stress that it sounded like a person clicking their tounge. Not gears‚Ä¶or electricity. Or even anything dropping because I looked. 

(Pause) context on myself and this house. I DO beleive in the paranormal more so spiritual. It‚Äôs cheesy to say I run through my options first before saying something is paranormal but I do. I am a huge skeptic because I WANT to find real proof. That is‚Ä¶until it fucking happens to me. (I now have two encounters that I can‚Äôt explain and were fucking terrifying and not fun in the moment) This house is new for my mom, about 6 months she lived there. She‚Äôs spiritual too and so far she says she‚Äôs felt like if there was any energy in the house there was one but she hadn‚Äôt felt it in a while. I bring this up as it‚Äôs relevant too. After I run out of explanations for the clicks‚Ä¶.i start to remember my mom‚Äôs accounts of the energy she sensed before. To me‚Ä¶the bill fits. The weird noise‚Ä¶and the oppressive off feeling. The possibility I am not alone is now running through my mind‚Ä¶but it hasn‚Äôt hurt me this whole time and I‚Äôm tired so I just..go back to scrolling my phone and I try to ignore the paranoia. 

I lay there‚Ä¶my knees up no blanket. I move from Pinterest to YT to watch one of my comfort content creators because the uncomfortable feeling isnt going away. However I couldn‚Äôt really find safety in it because everytime I would get too engrossed in the video a hair would glide across my knee. I would reach for it and brush it away‚Ä¶it‚Äôd stop and then start up again. I get agitated and look for the hair but I can‚Äôt find it. This goes on for 3? Rounds of me feeling the hair tickle, brushing it away, it stops, then it starts up again. 

All the while the off feeling stays consistent. Not getting worse, not lessening. Just‚Ä¶staying still making the room feel stuffy. I finally get pissed with the hair and go for my blanket. I grab it and start to pull it over me. There‚Äôs this weird‚Ä¶vivid moment of me noticing that a portion of my blanket is draped over the couch arm‚Ä¶hanging out of sight. And I‚Äôm suddenly scared to pull it because I‚Äôm terrified it will go taunt‚Ä¶like something has it snagged. Thank fully that doesn‚Äôt happen and I pull it over and onto myself. Getting comfortable again. Finally‚Ä¶.i start feeling secure. I‚Äôm engrossed in my video and starting to get sleepy. ‚Ä¶.ive pretty much calmed down and the off feeling goes to the back of my mind. It‚Äôs not gone..it just seems to have lost interest‚Ä¶or so I thought. 

Next to the couch. Is a two level coffee table. On the lower level is some newspapers‚Ä¶laying secure on some toys. My brother had been playing with it earlier that day. I‚Äôm laying there‚Ä¶watching the video when suddenly a sheet of the newspaper moves from the coffee table and drags across the floor toward me fast. It only moves a couple inches but It‚Äôs loud, it‚Äôs sudden, and I have no fucking idea what caused it. I don‚Äôt fucking stick around to ask

I‚Äôm on my feet, phone in hand because it was already there, scrambling over the couch and to the stairs which I just fly up because I‚Äôm so out of my mind scared. The next thing I know I‚Äôm in my mom‚Äôs room standing over her telling her what just happened. She is very sleepy‚Ä¶.and just offers me to sleep with her (her boyfriend is at work) I crawl into bed without much option because I wasn‚Äôt about to go BACK downstairs. I‚Äôm in shock‚Ä¶laying there watching Seinfeld playing quietly on her TV. She doesn‚Äôt start taking me seriously until she sees that I‚Äôm still not calm after 10 minutes. We talk through it and she just says it was yellowjackets and the weed. LISTEN I would take that explanation for EVERYTHING else except the newspaper. It drug TOWARD me‚Ä¶against the airflow of the fan behind me. It was loud and the movement was violent ‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know how else to explain jt. One minute the room was silent‚Ä¶and then All hell broke loose. 

Furthermore the torment didn‚Äôt even stop after I went to sleep with mom. The off feeling came back and everytime she would fall asleep more sh*t would happen. The worse being me watch the tv and out the corner of my eye I see a white shirt in her closet move. I keep hearing my name be harshly whispered when I‚Äôm on the verge of falling asleep promptly waking me up and not letting me rest. Yes‚Ä¶this bit ‚Ä¶sounds like classic paranoia.  But I want to convey that it was persistent throughout the whole night and another person, my mother, didn‚Äôt make it stop. Idk, idk I just needed to share. It was scary‚Ä¶I kept getting this feeling like I was being punished by it. For what? Who knows. I‚Äôm not a saint and i had been fighting with my brother alot this weekend look idk. whatever jt was ‚Ä¶paranoia or otherwise tormented me the entire night. 

Maybe it was the weed, maybe it was Yellowjackets. I everything experienced that night is not recorded, I have no proof, it sounds like paranoia and most likely is paranoia‚Ä¶everything except what that newspaper did‚Ä¶.thats what bother me because I can‚Äôt explain it. 

Idk‚Ä¶I‚Äôd like thoughts‚Ä¶some confirmation that I‚Äôm not alone. Maybe someone telling me it wasn‚Äôt real because there‚Äôs a part of me that‚Äôs scared whatever it was followed me home. Nothing more has happened but you‚Äôd be on guard too‚Ä¶

 lpa 897 mg/l, LDL 3.31 mmol/l, HDL 1.5 mmol/l, uric acid 450 Œºmol

I also had a Color Doppler Ultrasound reading:

 R-CAA: 0.5MM, R-CCA bifurcation 0.8mm, R-ICA 0.5mm

L-CCA 0.5MM, L-CCA BIFURCATION: 0.7mm, L-ICA 0.6MM

Right common carotid artery PSV 80cm/s. right common internal carotid artery PSV 66cm/s, left common carotid artery 80cm/s, left internal carotid artery PSV 65 cm/s. 

  
I put all the info into ChatGpt and this is what it said.

Thanks for sharing the additional information from your **Color Doppler Ultrasound** of the **carotid and femoral arteries**. These results are very relevant in the context of your **elevated Lp(a)** and **LDL** levels. Let‚Äôs break it down and interpret it all **together**.

# üß† Ultrasound Findings Explained

# 1. Intima-Media Thickness (IMT)

You listed:

* **R-CCA**: 0.5 mm
* **R-CCA Bifurcation**: 0.8 mm
* **R-ICA**: 0.5 mm
* **L-CCA**: 0.5 mm
* **L-CCA Bifurcation**: 0.7 mm
* **L-ICA**: 0.6 mm

**Interpretation**:

* These are measurements of the **intima-media thickness (IMT)** ‚Äî the thickness of the inner layers of your arteries.
* **Normal IMT**: Less than **0.9 mm**. You are **within normal range**, though the **bifurcation values (0.7‚Äì0.8 mm)** are at the **higher end of normal**.
* **No plaques** were mentioned, which is good ‚Äî it means **no visible atherosclerotic buildup** was seen in those arteries.

# 2. Peak Systolic Velocity (PSV)

You reported:

* **Right CCA PSV**: 80 cm/s
* **Right ICA PSV**: 66 cm/s
* **Left CCA PSV**: 80 cm/s
* **Left ICA PSV**: 65 cm/s

**Interpretation**:

* These flow velocities are all **within normal limits**.
   * **Normal ICA PSV**: <125 cm/s
   * No signs of significant stenosis or blockage.

# üß† Combining With Lab Results

|**Test/Measure**|**Result**|**Implication**|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Lp(a)**|897 mg/L|Very high CVD risk|
|**LDL**|3.31 mmol/L|Moderately elevated (should be <1.8 mmol/L in your case)|
|**HDL**|1.5 mmol/L|Protective|
|**Uric Acid**|450 Œºmol/L|Mildly high (possible metabolic stress)|
|**Carotid/Femoral IMT & Flow**|Normal|**yet**No significant atherosclerosis  |

# üü° What This Means for Your Risk

# ‚úÖ Good News:

* **No plaque formation yet** in key arteries (carotid/femoral).
* **Normal blood flow velocities** ‚Äî no current obstruction.
* **Protective HDL** level.

# üö® BUT:

* Your **very high Lp(a)** places you in a **high to very high cardiovascular risk** category **even if imaging is clean right now**.
* **Lp(a)** accelerates **plaque formation**, **especially when LDL is also elevated** ‚Äî which is your case.
* Think of this like the **storm clouds are gathering**, even if there's no rain yet.

# üß≠ What to Do Next

# 1. Prevent Progression

Even if arteries are clean now, **they may not stay that way** with current Lp(a) and LDL:

* **Lower LDL aggressively** ‚Äî ideally **<1.8 mmol/L**, possibly **<1.4**.
* **Statins** may not lower Lp(a), but can stabilize plaque and reduce LDL.
* Consider adding **ezetimibe** or **PCSK9 inhibitors** if needed.

# 2. Consider Further Assessment

* A **coronary calcium score (CT)** may help assess whether Lp(a) has affected the **heart arteries** even if neck/leg arteries are okay.

# 3. Lifestyle Optimization

* Plant-rich, anti-inflammatory diet (Mediterranean or DASH)
* Regular exercise
* Weight control
* Avoid smoking, alcohol (helps uric acid too)

# 4. Genetic Counseling/Family Screening

* First-degree relatives should be screened ‚Äî **Lp(a) is hereditary**.

# üìå Final Summary

You have a **genetic risk marker (Lp(a)) that significantly raises cardiovascular risk**, but **current imaging shows no structural damage yet** ‚Äî which is **excellent** and gives you a **key window to act**. Now is the time to **lower LDL and control risk factors aggressively**, so plaque doesn't build up later.

......................................................................................................................................................................

I quit smoking about 10 months ago. My LPA was 1202 at the time, however i'm still a heavy drinker on weekends and like black coffee. I know the alcohol has to go, but are there any other things I should be doing? 

Should I ask for a statin? Is getting on statins for life? Are there any medicines on the horizon?

I run and go to crossfit most days, and played sport most of my life. Although I'vee developed a little beer belly in the past year, I can still comfortably and regularly run 5-10km at 6:00km pace pretty relaxed, so I'm not majorly unfit.

**Story 1: The Barefoot Watchers**

I'm gonna tell y'all something that'll make you think twice about living near the woods. This ain't no campfire tale - this is real as the scars on my hands and the sleepless nights that followed.

Back in 2012, I was 26, working construction, living with my girlfriend Sarah in my family's old brick house. The place had been in our family for generations - my grandpa built it, my dad inherited it, and now it was mine. What made it special wasn't just the history, but the location. We were the last house on Elm Street, surrounded by woods on two sides. These weren't your typical suburban woods either - we're talking about thousands of acres of dense forest that seemed to stretch on forever.

Sarah and I had been living there about four months when it started. It was a Sunday morning in January, snow covering everything like a white blanket. I was heading out for my weekly coffee run when I noticed something that made my blood run cold - footprints in the snow, leading right up to my pickup truck.

At first, I thought maybe Sarah had come out early, but these prints came from the woods, went straight to my driver's side door, then turned around and headed right back into the trees. No detours, no wandering around - just a direct line to my truck and back. It was like someone had been checking on my vehicle in the middle of the night.

I asked Sarah about it, but she'd been asleep all night. We both tried to brush it off as maybe some drunk guy who got lost, but deep down, something felt wrong about the whole thing.

Three years passed. Sarah and I got engaged, life moved on, and we pretty much forgot about those weird footprints. Then, in 2015 - I remember it clearly because it was right after the Seahawks lost the Super Bowl - I walked outside to head to work and nearly had a heart attack.

Footprints were everywhere. Not just a few - we're talking dozens of them. Around the house, near every window, across the entire yard, like someone had been doing laps around our property all night long. But here's the part that still gives me nightmares - Sarah noticed something I'd missed. None of the prints had shoe treads. They were all barefoot.

Who the hell walks around barefoot in freezing snow? That's when we knew we weren't dealing with some lost drunk. This was something else entirely.

I grabbed my hunting rifle and followed the tracks into the woods. My dad always taught me to handle my own problems, so calling the cops felt like giving up. The trail led deep into the forest, winding through thick undergrowth and around massive oak trees that had been standing since before my grandpa was born.

About thirty minutes in, something happened that made me question everything. The trail split into two separate paths. Not like someone had doubled back - I mean two distinct sets of bare footprints going in different directions. Either there were two people out there, or one person was playing some sick game with me.

That's when I heard it - a low whistle coming from somewhere ahead. Not like a bird or the wind through the trees. This was deliberate, almost like a signal. Then another whistle answered from a completely different direction.

I was outnumbered, and I knew it. The smart thing was to get the hell out of there, so I turned around and practically ran back to the house. We called the police that night, but they couldn't do much without evidence of an actual crime. Trespassing wasn't enough to launch a search party.

For years after that, nothing happened. Sarah and I got married, settled into married life, and started talking about having kids. We'd almost convinced ourselves that whatever had been out there was gone for good.

Then, this past January, it all came back worse than before.

I woke up to Sarah shaking me, tears streaming down her face. ""They're back,"" she whispered. I looked out the window and felt my heart drop into my stomach. Footprints covered our entire property - not just around the house this time, but leading right up to our shed. When I checked, half my tools were missing: my chainsaw, several power tools, rope, and duct tape.

This wasn't just trespassing anymore. This was preparation.

I called my buddy Theo, a former Marine who knew these woods better than anyone. When I explained the situation, he didn't hesitate. ""Pack your gear,"" he said. ""We're ending this tonight.""

Theo showed up around noon with enough firepower to take down a small army. He had his AR-10 with a thermal scope, I had my hunting rifle, and we both carried sidearms. Sarah was terrified, begging us not to go, but I couldn't live with this hanging over our heads anymore.

The tracks were fresh, probably from the night before. We followed them deeper into the woods than I'd ever gone, past the creek that marked the edge of what I considered ""our"" forest, into territory that felt wild and untamed.

After about an hour, the tracks split again - but this time into three separate trails. Three sets of bare footprints, all heading in different directions. We were dealing with at least three people now, maybe more.

Theo suggested we follow the middle trail since it seemed the most worn. As we walked, he kept checking his thermal scope, scanning the trees ahead of us. The sun was starting to set, and the temperature was dropping fast.

""Movement,"" Theo whispered suddenly, grabbing my arm. He raised his rifle and peered through the scope. ""Two hundred yards ahead. Three... no, four figures.""

He handed me the rifle, and what I saw through that thermal scope will haunt me until the day I die. Four human shapes huddled around what looked like a small fire. But they weren't just sitting there - they were moving in ways that didn't look human. Crawling on all fours, twitching their heads like animals, making jerky, unnatural movements.

And they were completely naked, even in the freezing cold.

As we watched, two larger figures picked up two smaller ones and placed them on their backs. Then all four of them started moving deeper into the woods, but not walking upright. They were moving on their hands and feet, like some kind of twisted pack of wolves.

We followed at a distance, using the thermal scope to track them. They led us to a clearing where we saw something that made my blood freeze. There were more of them - at least a dozen figures moving around what looked like a campsite. But this wasn't any normal camping setup.

There were crude shelters made from branches and animal hides, and in the center of the clearing was a large pit filled with bones. Human bones, from the look of them. Some were old and weathered, but others looked fresh.

That's when I realized what had happened to all the missing persons reports from our county over the years. The hikers who never came back, the hunters who disappeared without a trace. They'd all ended up here, in this hellish clearing in the middle of the woods.

One of the figures suddenly stood upright and looked directly at us. Even through the thermal scope, I could see its head tilting, like it was listening. Then it let out that same whistle I'd heard years before, and every other figure in the clearing stopped moving and turned toward us.

""Run,"" Theo whispered, and we both took off through the woods like our lives depended on it.

Behind us, we could hear them pursuing - not running like normal people, but crashing through the underbrush with an animal-like ferocity. They were fast, faster than they had any right to be, and they knew these woods better than we did.

We ran for what felt like hours before the sounds of pursuit finally faded. When we made it back to the house, Sarah was waiting for us with the car packed and the engine running.

""We're leaving,"" she said. ""Tonight.""

I wanted to argue, to say we should call the police or the FBI or whoever handles this kind of thing. But then I looked at Theo, and I could see in his eyes that he'd seen enough combat to know when a situation was hopeless.

We drove to Sarah's sister's house three states away and stayed there for two weeks while I arranged to sell our house. We never went back, not even to get our belongings. I hired a moving company to pack everything up and ship it to us.

The house sold within a month to a young couple from the city who thought they were getting a great deal on a historic property in a quiet, wooded neighborhood. I tried to warn them, but they thought I was just some crazy redneck trying to scare them.

That was six months ago. Last week, I saw a news report about two bodies found in the woods behind our old house. The couple who bought it from us. They'd been missing for three days before someone found what was left of them.

The police are calling it a bear attack, but I know better. I know what's really out there in those woods, and I know they're still watching, still waiting for the next family to move into that house at the end of Elm Street.

If you're ever looking at real estate in rural areas, especially old houses surrounded by thick woods, ask yourself this: Why is the price so low? Why has the house changed hands so many times? And if you see bare footprints in the snow leading up to your front door, don't follow them into the woods.

#
The more essential the role machines play in our lives, the more integral the data they produce are to our human existence. In addition, the devices become more inextricably intertwined with us: socially, physically, and biologically. 
#
Researchers suggest that it is less plausible that we would voluntarily turn over the data produced by these devices to a third party or permit someone else to do so. If this is true, what are the implications for the enhanced individual? Furthermore, what are the implications of data generated by a member of the armed forces? For example, who owns such data, and for what purposes can these data be used? From a legal perspective, enhanced humans will likely generate huge amounts of data, which makes them uniquely susceptible to targeting and surveillance. Current legal
frameworks are not structured to handle such scenarios.
#
Conversely, consider the privacy aspect of the legal argument in which cyborg
technology inherently collects data from those around the enhanced individual. Some of the technology predictions within this study envision human/machine enhancements in which audio, video, geolocation, and time stamps could be recorded and distributed. From a national security perspective, this enhances situational awareness and clearly has military applications. But in a civilian setting, such as in a coffee shop or the gym, it will have other implications, including impact on bystanders. Although an individual volunteers for enhancement and agrees to any corresponding collection of his or her personal data, bystanders are unlikely to have granted the same permission.",2,1748498080.0,Futurism,2,1.0,False
1ky3977,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1ky3977/finally_broke_down_during_bible_study/,Finally broke down during bible study!,"I stopped attending meetings when I was about 12. I've no interest in the organization, I've always hated the message. Back in 2024 I was put on stimulants for the first time, went a little crazy, took 400mg of thc which was my first time having an edible. 

Anyways, I was super un-trusting of my friends at the time (for good reason) and I was at my 3rd or 4th lowest point. One of the ladies from the kingdom hall my parents go to, and I would ride horses with, reached out and asked if I wanted to study with her. I didn't have the mental capacity to say no and my mom had been telling me that becoming a JW would rid me of my ptsd, bpd, mdd, si, ect. 

So I've been studying for a year! And I've wanted to quit for a year! But last april I quit my job on the spot because I wanted to kms so bad. I haven't gotten a ‚Äúreal job‚Äù since then. In November I ended up dropping the only friend I had. I turn 20 in about a week. I still live with my mom and step dad. I'm currently the only child left in the house but my 2nd brother (POMO) will probably move back in soon.

All of this is to say I REALLY really value time out of my house. I hate my step dad with a homicidal passion. He works from home. I can't even think about it without crying because it bothers me so bad. Me and these 2 women study at a coffee shop once a week for an hour or 2, and I'm invited to all the functions/get-togethers.

So that's a large part of why I haven't stepped back, the other reason being I just don't know how to say ‚Äúno more‚Äù without everything blowing up in my face. 

Now this has worked out pretty ok for the most part. Until yesterday! While reading and discussing ‚ÄúHow to identify real Christians‚Äù my study buddy had mentioned how other Christians use the Bible as justification for abusing their children, and that's not what the bible preaches! (Doesn't it?) 

Despite being diagnosed with ptsd I never thought it was a real issue for me. But then, as I looked at the ugly ass wallpaper, my hands started shaking and I got a lump in my throat and I tried to hold it back like I always do, but this time I couldn't. I excused myself just as I started crying. I don't know how long I was in the bathroom but if I remember the time correctly it had to have been like 15 minutes. 

When I went back I just said ‚ÄúI can't do this right now.‚Äù They reassured me and apologized for upsetting me, one tried to lighten the mood by talking about how she got her butt ‚Äúbea- whooped‚Äù when she was 3. She claimed she deserved it and said ‚Äúit's funny how that's basically my first memory.‚Äù While insisting it wasn't traumatic. 

So then I explained why I had such a reaction. As a child I didn't have a ton of abuse inflicted on myself, it was mostly my second oldest brother. In that moment I remembered how my step dad had abused my brother, how he was exactly the same as our bio dad who everyone knows is an abusive POS, how he was never held accountable, how he laughed, how my mom told me ‚Äúthis is what happens when you don't behave‚Äù, how everybody thinks of my step dad as a charming Christian man, and that's exactly why I don't trust a single one of them because they all act the same, and they always get away with it, and I will never be able to trust a witness because not only did I witness the abuse I knew too many other people with the same story, and no matter how much they claim to have changed these cases keep coming out!!!

He only stopped the abuse because we started to abuse him back. My mom has expressed remorse, but never him. So we can't forgive him. It felt so good to finally talk about it. Ugh, I wish I could do it again. Next time in front of the entire congregation! 

They encouraged me to tell my mom, that I never forget. I remember EVERYTHING. I haven't talked to her yet. My family is like mentos in cola. So silent, so sweet, but then‚Ä¶ it's a big mess. 

But I'm thinking I might use this mental breakdown as a way to ‚Äúpause‚Äù (quit) studying. I might print out all the court cases I can find and give it to them next week. I might explode. Who knows!

Cathy Smith was awarded a $5 million sign-on bonus on top of a base pay of $925,000 per year and $4.5 million in stock incentives. Yet this is nothing compared to the compensation package of their new CEO, Brian Niccol, who was poached from Chipotle by Starbucks to transform the brand and bring success back to the business. The company aims to increase earnings, yet they awarded Niccol a **$96 million dollar compensation package**, making him the highest paid CEO in the company‚Äôs history. As one of the highest paid executives in corporate America, [Niccol earned approximately 6,666 times that of its average barista](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf). It is worth pointing out, in regard to that number, that many Starbucks employees work part time. This compensation pack put him above the CEO of Apple, Microsoft, Disney, GE, and more when comparing 2024 CEO annual pay. Apple and Microsoft generated net incomes that were almost *triple* that of Starbucks in 2024, which makes this all the more shocking in my opinion. 

**Brian Niccol Starbucks Compensation Package Breakdown:**

* $10 million signing bonus
* $5 million sign on bonus after one month of employment
* $1.6 million annual base salary
* [$418,071 additional compensation benefit ](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf)(cost breakdown page 72)
* $250,000 allocated for commute expenses and some personal travel using a private corporate jet
* $90 million in stock awards

Meanwhile, the company continues to permanently shut down locations and layoff employees. Niccol recently [announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that the company would eliminate 1,100 corporate employees (not baristas) to 

>‚Äúincrease operational efficiency, increase accountability, reduce complexity, and drive better integration‚Äù. Niccol explained that the layoffs, which took effect 2/25, were necessary to address these issues. 

Now, after these layoffs, the **CEO tells workers to step it up** and that he 

>‚Äú[wants corporate employees to work harder](https://qz.com/starbucks-corporate-workers-big-fix-menu-cuts-1851767920?utm_medium=sharefromsite&utm_source=quartz_reddit) and take accountability for the coffee giant‚Äôs financial health‚Äù claiming that the chain's turnaround now relies on greater accountability; ‚Äú[we own whether or not this place grows](https://www.wsj.com/business/hospitality/starbucks-ceo-tells-workers-to-step-it-up-after-layoffs-3fdba9f3)‚Äù.¬†

This greater accountability doesn‚Äôt seem to apply to Niccol. He also[ announced](https://about.starbucks.com/press/2025/message-from-brian-global-support-partner-announcement/) that hiring for future partners in the U.S. will require relocation to Seattle to work in the head office. Meanwhile Niccol himself is not required to relocate from his California home and maintains his ability to travel the 1,000 miles between his primary residence and the Seattle headquarters for his commute so he can work in person 3 days a week. The greater hypocrisy lies in the fact that this decision to allow Niccol to commute on the company's dime completely disregards their promises to combat climate change.

>[Starbucks environmental promise](https://about.starbucks.com/our-environmental-promise-give-more-than-we-take/): ‚ÄúAt Starbucks, we promise to *give more than we take* from the planet. Our comprehensive approach is built on our commitment to build a *more sustainable, equitable and resilient future* for coffee, farmers, communities and our planet.

[‚ÄúEstimates, likely on the low side](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf), ‚Äúindicate that his commute will release nearly nine tons of carbon dioxide each round trip. That‚Äôs roughly the annual energy-consumption footprint of the typical American household.‚Äù 

Shareholders did express concern over this issue, making a [proposal](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (page 96) requesting an annual emissions congruency report. The Starbucks board of directors recommended shareholders [vote against](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) (pg 97) this proposal, claiming such a report is not an effective use of time and company resources, and they argue that Niccol should use the private jet to enhance his personal safety. The obvious solution to this is to have Niccol relocate to the Seattle area. Considering he decided to relocate the entire Chipotle headquarters, and 400 jobs, from Colorado to his city of residence in California, I doubt he would ever choose to make that move for the benefit of the company, let alone the environment.¬†

>Defending the cost of hiring Niccol, the Starbucks board stated that they believe ‚ÄúMr. Niccol, a highly sought-after, effective leader with a proven track record, has the ideal industry experience and operational background to drive sustainable, long-term growth at Starbucks‚Äù. ‚Äú[Starbucks' critical need](https://s203.q4cdn.com/326826266/files/doc_financials/2024/ar/Starbucks-2025-Proxy-Statement.pdf) for a transformative leader at a pivotal moment in its history‚Äù led them to poach Niccol from Chipotle, where he was also the CEO. 

Clearly the company believes their investment will pay off. Initially, it did. After announcing Niccol as CEO the companies stock price shot up nearly [25%](https://www.fool.com/investing/2024/08/19/starbucks-stock-surges-with-new-ceo-at-the-helm/#:~:text=Why%20this%20looks%20like%20a,9). It has since then fallen.

The fact that **Niccol is a known union buster** surely helped secure his employment, not that the company would ever admit it. It‚Äôs no surprise that union negotiations with the company have stalled since December. 

>Currently, ""[union members](https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-05-01/starbucks-union-baristas-contract-talks) remain critical of how bargaining has been conducted under Niccol's tenure and have questioned his compensation package.""

The previous CEO, Laxman Narasimhan, pivoted away from the tough stance of founder Howard Shultz regarding unions, and agreed (in Feb 2024) to [begin contract discussions](https://www.inc.com/bruce-crumley/amid-rising-unionizing-efforts-starbucks-accepts-mediation-with-unionized-workers/91142408). 6 months later, Niccol was announced as the new CEO. While the company listed other reasons for the decision, one can only wonder...

Brian Niccol is no stranger to success. He is credited with many achievements in his previous positions at Pizza Hut (CMO), Taco Bell (CMO & CEO), and, most notably, Chipotle (CEO). Much of his success in these positions was achieved through digital innovation.¬†

* Pizza Hut (CMO 2007-2011)
   * Introduced mobile phone ordering in 2008, followed by an app in 2009 which, after 3 months, generated $1 million in sales.
* Taco Bell (CMO 2011-2015)(CEO 2015-2018)
   * Oversaw implementation of breakfast menu, Cantina Bell menu, the launch of Doritos Locos Taco, and the ‚ÄúLive Mas‚Äù slogan
   * Increased revenue, market share, and profitability
* Chipotle (CEO 2018-2024)
   * Implemented chipotlanes
   * Added digital order pick-up shelves
   * Doubled revenue, increased profits x7
   * Increased stock price x8¬†

**Will this success translate to his new job as CEO of Starbucks?** ***I would argue NO.***¬†

Starbucks gave Niccol an outrageous compensation package, and it's questionable that their investment will pay off. His heavy focus on digital presence seems unlikely to yield the same level of success it did in his other jobs. Online ordering is a common tool utilized by most companies now, like Starbucks, unlike when Niccol pushed it forward at Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. While he is credited with creating secondary make lines for online orders at Chipotle, one [article](https://www.investors.com/news/management/leaders-and-success/chipotle-ceo-brian-niccol-listens-while-he-works/#:~:text=Following%20the%20savvy%20action%20of,it%20made%20customers%20happier%2C%20too.) credits the origin of the idea to a Chipotle store operator, not Niccol.¬†There is no doubt Niccol has extensive digital experience, but Starbucks already has both mobile ordering and drive throughs available for customers to use. The long mobile order wait times are the one area Starbucks really needs to improve. While I have no doubt Niccol will have an impact here, I doubt he will be able to attain the same degree of success he did with Taco Bell or Chipotle, something shareholders and investors clearly expect to see from him again.

He joined both Taco Bell and Chipotle during times when they were struggling due to issues with food quality. Taco Bell was dealing with the fallout of a lawsuit over beef quality that lead to a [28%](https://www.reuters.com/article/markets/us/taco-bell-still-hurting-from-beef-quality-lawsuit-idUSN1E76D0LV/) decrease in operating profit Q2 2011. Chipotle had the infamous e.coli outbreak in 2015 that severely damaged the brand. Niccol is credited with leading a successful turnaround effort at both, but the companies really had no other place to go but up after these things were fixed, something any CEO was capable of achieving. 

""But look at how much he increased revenue, profit, and stock price at Chipotle!"" One might argue this, but let me tell you how he really achieved this. Price increases, prices increase, and then more price increases. The company hadn‚Äôt increased prices too much in the years before Niccol became CEO. After he joined in 2018 prices increased about 10% across the year. Since 2021 the company has [increased prices 7 times](https://www.reddit.com/r/Chipotle/comments/1h60h2q/chipotle_to_raise_prices_for_the_7th_time_since/) under his leadership. While some increase is necessary and expected, his increases far exceeded both. Since he left, prices increased once by 2% in December, and the new CEO (Scott Boatwright) announced the company will absorb any cost increases incurred by Trump's tariffs. Something I highly doubt Niccol would have done. ""But Starbucks pledged to not increase prices in 2025!"" Yeah, except they made this promise before the announcement of the tariffs. Also, have they actually kept this promise so far? [This Reddit user claims not.](https://www.reddit.com/r/OutOfTheLoop/comments/1j6ofvn/whats_up_with_starbucks_raising_prices_after/) To be fair, Niccol did recognize that many people have expressed displeasure with Starbucks prices and how they‚Äôve been increasing, which he ignored at Chipotle. Something I‚Äôm sure he regrets now considering the tariffs.¬†

Overall, based on the information I‚Äôve gathered it seems like much of his previous success was primarily due to lucky timing. I don‚Äôt see him being successful at Starbucks. Thus far, stock prices would indicate I‚Äôm not wrong. The changes he has made so far haven‚Äôt done anything to improve the company. The practice, which was halted in 2020 during the pandemic, generated some buzz initially, but quickly fell apart as most baristas didn‚Äôt meet expectations. Considering a major issue Starbucks faces is long wait times, the implemented idea by Niccol seems counterintuitive. Baristas don't have time for it but some have claimed they've been [written up](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1iz8tyc/written_up_for_forgetting_to_write_on_cups/&ved=2ahUKEwjH_5eJ7seNAxW2tokEHTatCbYQFnoECCQQAQ&usg=AOvVaw1UsYFiNHs2RU1HaxBDdyQi) or [sent home](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1j5cutx/sent_home_for_not_writing_on_cups/%23:~:text%3DSent%2520home%2520for%2520not%2520writing%2520on%2520cups%2520:%2520r/starbucks&ved=2ahUKEwiZjKHO7seNAxUGlokEHTM_H60Q-tANegQIDRAP&usg=AOvVaw2Oa8R0qIxiAGWjQS025n7s) by their manager for failing to do so. Overall, the idea seems to have backfired.

Niccol also decided to change the dress code, requiring baristas to wear solid black shirts, a change not well received by employees. 

>""Customers care more about the wait time for their latte than the shirt their barista is [wearing](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code).""

Changing the dress code seems entirely unnecessary and useless. I fail to see how the color of a baristas shirt is going to impact guest perception. Personally, I've never even noticed the color of their shirts before. The decision seems to be one meant to impress shareholders by showing Starbucks is 'professional' and 'high end'. Additionally, it's surely meant to reinforce company culture (something Niccol is supposed to excel at improving) but the change has done the opposite of improving employee satisfaction, negatively impacting moral for many. Niccol, a known union buster, didn't involve the union in this decision either. 

>""[Union workers say](https://www.fastcompany.com/91334497/the-real-reason-starbucks-baristas-are-so-angry-about-its-new-dress-code) the change is both restrictive and unproductive‚Äîand now, baristas are walking out."" ""In an email to supporters, Starbucks Workers United‚Äîthe union representing Starbucks baristas‚Äîcalled the dress code ‚Äúrestrictive,‚Äù adding that it was implemented ‚Äúwithout input from the baristas it affects.‚Äù The union has been bargaining to reach a contract with Starbucks for over three years, with no end in sight. It says that the new dress code represents ‚Äúbad faith bargaining,‚Äù alleging that the code undermines a tentative agreement about attire made at the bargaining table."" ""Starbucks should be working to finish the contract and solve its staffing issue‚Äînot implementing a new dress code. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre more than mad because the changes that the company is making don‚Äôt address the issues that we‚Äôre facing in the stores.""

Let's be real it's a coffee shop, not fine dining. Black shirt, blue shirt, purple shirt...no one cares. Except the CEO apparently. He wants to create a consistent and recognizable brand experience for guests as if the green apron didn't already accomplish that. Both the dress code change and cup writing seem to be out of touch decisions. Maybe Niccol needs to spend some time working as a barista to figure out how he could actually improve things for both guests and employees. 

Brian Niccol gets too much hype in the corporate world in my opinion. I‚Äôm just waiting for his downfall‚Äìhonestly I‚Äôm hoping for it.

## Key Features Analysis

The best cushion bench cushions of 2025 offer a combination of comfort, durability, and style. Several key features distinguish the top performers in this category.

**Material Quality:** High-quality materials are the foundation of a great cushion bench cushion. Look for durable, weather-resistant fabrics like solution-dyed acrylic, polyester, or olefin for outdoor use. These materials are resistant to fading, moisture, and mildew. The fill material is equally important; high-density foam provides excellent support and shape retention, while polyester fiberfill offers a softer, more plush feel.

**Construction and Stitching:** The way a cushion is constructed plays a crucial role in its longevity and appearance. reinforced seams and sturdy stitching prevent fraying and tearing, ensuring the cushion withstands regular use. Look for cushions with piped edges for a more refined look and added durability. Internal baffling or channeling can definitely help keep the fill evenly distributed, preventing clumping and maintaining consistent comfort.

**Dimensions and Fit:** A properly sized cushion is essential for both comfort and aesthetics.Measure your bench carefully before selecting a cushion to ensure a snug and secure fit. Consider the thickness of the cushion as well; a thicker cushion will provide more cushioning but may raise the seating height. Bench cushions typically range in length from 36 inches to 72 inches, with widths varying from 12 inches to 24 inches.

**Water Resistance and UV Protection:** For outdoor benches, water resistance and UV protection are paramount. Cushions with water-repellent coatings or fabrics will resist light rain and spills, preventing water from soaking into the fill. UV-resistant materials will prevent the fabric from fading or deteriorating due to prolonged sun exposure. Look for cushions that are specifically designed for outdoor use and labeled as water-resistant or UV-protected.

**Design and Style:** Cushion bench cushions come in a wide variety of colors, patterns, and styles to suit any decor. Choose a color or pattern that complements your existing furniture and outdoor space. Consider the overall style of your bench as well; a modern bench may look best with a sleek, minimalist cushion, while a rustic bench may benefit from a more textured or patterned cushion. Consider cushion profiles too, such as knife-edge, boxed, or waterfall edge cushions.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Any outdoor or frequently used cushion should be easy to clean. Look for cushions with removable covers that can be machine washed or spot cleaned with mild soap and water. Water-resistant fabrics are also easier to wipe clean, preventing stains from setting in.

Key features of the best cushion bench cushions include:

* Durable, weather-resistant fabric
* High-density foam or polyester fill
* Reinforced seams and stitching
* Precise dimensions for a snug fit
* Water resistance and UV protection
* Removable, washable covers

## Core Benefits

Investing in a high-quality cushion bench cushion offers several significant benefits.

**Enhanced Comfort:** The primary benefit of a cushion bench cushion is increased comfort. A well-padded cushion transforms a hard, uncomfortable bench into a relaxing and inviting seating area. This is especially important for benches that are used frequently or for extended periods. High-density foam or fiberfill provides ample support, reducing pressure points and promoting better posture.

**Improved Aesthetics:** A stylish cushion can dramatically enhance the look of your bench and its surrounding space. With a wide range of colors, patterns, and styles to choose from, you can easily find a cushion that complements your existing decor. A well-chosen cushion can add a pop of color, texture, or visual interest to an otherwise plain bench, creating a more inviting and aesthetically pleasing environment.

**Protection for Benches:** Cushions can protect bench surfaces from scratches, dents, and other damage. This is especially important for wooden benches, which can be easily scratched or stained. A cushion acts as a barrier between the bench surface and everyday wear and tear, prolonging the life of your bench and keeping it looking its best.

**Increased Usability:** A comfortable cushion makes a bench more inviting and encourages people to use it more ofen. Whether it's for reading a book, enjoying a cup of coffee, or simply relaxing outdoors, a cushion transforms a bench into a desirable seating option. This can increase the overall usability of your outdoor space and create a more enjoyable experience for you and your guests.

**Versatility and Adaptability:** Cushion bench cushions are versatile and can be easily moved or replaced to suit changing needs or preferences. You can swap out cushions to update the look of your bench, experiment with different styles, or adjust the level of comfort. This adaptability makes cushion bench cushions a cost-effective and convenient way to enhance your seating options.

## FAQs Section

**How do I measure my bench for a cushion?**
measure the length, width, and thickness of the bench seat. For the length, measure from the inside of one leg to the inside of the other. For the width, measure from the front edge of the seat to the back edge. Consider the overhang desired. For the thickness, decide how high off the bench you want to sit. It is important to be as precise as possible to avoid incorrect sizing.

**What type of fill is best for a cushion bench cushion?**
High-density foam offers excellent support and shape retention, making it a good choice for benches that are used frequently. Polyester fiberfill provides a softer, more plush feel and is a good option for benches that are used less often. Some cushions combine both foam and fiberfill for a balance of support and comfort. The choice will depend on your personal preferences.

**How do I clean a cushion bench cushion?**
For cushions with removable covers,follow the care instructions on the label. Machine wash in cold water with a mild detergent and tumble dry on low heat. For cushions that cannot be machine washed, spot clean with mild soap and water.Be sure to rinse thoroughly and allow the cushion to air dry completely before using it. Avoid using harsh chemicals or abrasive cleaners, as these can damage the fabric or fill.

**How can I prevent my cushion bench cushion from fading?**
Choose cushions made from UV-resistant materials like solution-dyed acrylic or polyester. These materials are specifically designed to withstand prolonged sun exposure and resist fading. You can also apply a fabric protectant spray to add an extra layer of UV protection.Store your cushions indoors or in a shaded area when they are not in use to further minimize sun exposure.

Here is a tricky issue I grappled for some months: what to do when a beam wants to cut through my top plates? This is another of those problems I created for myself. Specifically because I want a decent sized attic above the loft. With approximately four feet of headroom you will need to hunch over and waddle through the attic, but that's far better than crawling on your belly as is often the case. The math is simple: this structure is allowed to be 6.5 meters high and that's it. Take out 1.5 meters for the 4 ft attic headroom, leaving 5 meters. Divide by two floors, subtract 8 foot wall height and that leaves a mere four inches for the floor, including subfloor and joists. See any place to compromise? I don't. I decided I just needed to do whatever is necessary to make those four inch floors work, as in passing inspection. And actually, I want to exceed code so the floors feel stiff, not bouncy.

My solution for the loft is 10 inch flitch beams. Ten inches actually means 9.5 inches in lumber-speak, and steel plate comes in one inch increments, so my flitch plate will be 9 inches, which should be stiff enough to span 16 feet with L/360 stiffness. I am currently learning to do those beam calculations, so I am not completely sure about this, and I don't know how thick that plate needs to be, but I believe I am in the ballpark and I am proceeding with this design. (Any structural engineer reading?? Please do weigh in - non-professionally of course - even if you think I am completely out to lunch. Especially in that case.)

OK, here's the problem: my ten inch flitch beams and my top plates want to occupy the same space. Something has to give. My early design idea was to lower the top plates so the beams sit on top of them, and make up the difference with cripples and, well, another top plate on top of the cripples. This idea did not survive. The framing was complex, with a lot of lumber taking up space where insulation needs to go.

My next idea was based on the fact that each of my flitch beams has two pieces of angle iron bolted onto in place of joist hangers (also adding some extra stiffness). How about if I terminate the flitch beams short of the top plates and let the angle iron continue on across the top of the top plates? So then the top plates can be at normal height, with small notches where the angle iron lands. It should work structurally. This idea almost worked, and I went ahead and modeled it. But I had nagging doubts about structural integrity - could the shear force on the bolts possibly split the wood? Or would the beams sag a little over time?

What I really want is to sit my beams directly on top of nice sturdy posts as is standard for post and beam construction. To do that, the beam has to go through the top plate. My aha moment was when I learned that beams going through top plates is perfectly normal, it just requires fastening the top plates properly to the beam. So now I am back to the subject of this post: fastening top plates using corner braces.

Here is my post forest, complete with corner brace assemblies and top plate cutting tools:

[Post and Brace Forest](https://preview.redd.it/27tr6okmem3f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e4d75b327341af2acfd751e20cb631ac3cee648)

The model tree for this is somewhat interesting, I think. Probably old hat for most experienced FreeCADders, but it took me quite some time to learn to do things in this efficient way:

[Post Forest Model Tree](https://preview.redd.it/315o56l0jn3f1.png?width=291&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e465727083e89a609c5300ebea9b5a5da71a40d)

Notice that I reused the same link array for posts and braces. Link arrays are really cool and I am finding more uses for them all the time.

Looking inside the SideSet part, things get more complicated:

[Brace Set Model Tree](https://preview.redd.it/3phnlq2njn3f1.png?width=389&format=png&auto=webp&s=90d23ca6259db908260585e171e830eb7893a1ad)

Links and mirrors galore! But notice, only a single brace is extruded from only a single brace sketch. That's what you want: only one thing to edit when it's time to refine the design, which it always is, and only one sketch for FreeCAD to re-solve. Efficient and maintainable.

FrontSet differs from SideSet only by a rotation, tidily accomplished with a link. I make heavy use of links. It seems, the more links I use, the faster my models load and recompute. Linking is way better than copying.

Notice, no bodies in there. I have to say that I gained a lot of productivity and ended up with far fewer broken models when I switched from Part Design workflow to Part workbench. Somewhat counter to the popular wisdom, but try it. You will see what I mean.

I also try to use parts as seldom as possible because they just have too many weird bugs. Drag and drop is particularly nightmarish... dropping a new feature in a part often causes that part to suck partically the entire world inside itself, laying waste to your carefully organized model tree. So instead of drag and drop, I edit the part group property instead. But you can't sort part components with the group property, you have to drag and drop, so your choices are either leave your part components sorted randomly, or manually repair the mess it makes after you sort them by drag and drop. Then there are the bogus ""link goes outside"" warnings. This isn't just a usability glitch, it's a usability crisis.

Another really annoying detail about parts is the origin. While I am sure that some users make use of it, I almost never do. I tried to use part origins in the way they are apparently intended to be used, but I only ever ended up with grief in terms of productivity and maintainability. There always seems to be a better, more natural and more maintainable way to do the same thing. To add insult to injury, when you copy parts you get namespace spam: lots of renamed axes and origin vertices that are identical to the one you copied from, and never get used anyway. I would greatly appreciate a sticky option to disable part origin, including turning off the namespace spam.

Why do I use parts at all? Because part is the only container feature that allows its components to have different styles. In this model, braces, bolts and posts all have different styles, so I have to use parts to accomplish that. Otherwise, life is much better with compounds, which are lightweight, powerful and heavily used by me.

OK, end of rant. Now a bit about those bolts. And before that, something about why I made this model in the first place. It is because my method of attaching top plates to beams will need to pass structural engineering review, and I want that review to be as cursory as possible. Basically, just look at the model, observe that it is obviously stronger than some similar thing already widely used, stamp that stamp and move on to more interesting things. In this case, I bolt right through the beams and top plates with sturdy brackets as opposed to typical top plate strapping, which uses nails through thin, floppy straps. Never mind that top plates are typically secured to corner posts with just a couple of nails... by comparison, my scheme seems to be built like the proverbial tank.

To make this clear, I need to show my bolting pattern. Modeling fasteners in FreeCAD can be quite painful because of the lack of usable variants. Instead of properly parametric variants, what everybody does as a workaround is, copy a part along with all its subparts then manually adjust the variant properties and constraints. This quickly becomes a maintenance tar pit. You want to change all your variants in a similar way? Good luck, you better have lots of time and lots of coffee on hand.

For these bolts, I wanted to minimize that pain and end up with as maintainable a result as possible. I observed that I don't need to model the bolt shaft because it is always inside something solid where you can't see it. So I modeled the bolt as two separate objects, the hex end and the nut end. To model a full bolt assembly I link those two parts into a compound, with appropriate separation. This is easy, maintainable, flexible and efficient. As a sweetener, link includes a scaling factor, so I can easily model any size of bolt I need. Here is a closeup that gives away this little modeling secret:

[A Bolt Doesn't Need a Shaft](https://preview.redd.it/pest66uqem3f1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=9e3838fc697384ea88907732c3c12b734e3db311)

OK, that's one sticky little design problem resolved. I think. Of course I expect issues when it comes to building this in real life. It could be hard to sourcing brackets exactly matching my design. But there does seem that a number of shops offer custom manufacturing runs for a modest number of parts at a reasonable price, so I am hopeful about that. Price is basically by the pound. I guess they just set up their machine and feed material into it.

Drilling the bolts holes accurately will be another challenge, particularly for the beams, where there is a total of half an inch of metal to drill through, and the holes in the metal need to line up with the holes in the wood. Some kind of jig I think, and a drill press if at all possible, as opposed to a hand drill. Anyway, plenty of time to think about that. For now I need to focus on preparing plans for the upcoming permit application, and preparing my model for engineering review, an essential part of the permitting process.",2,1748497617.0,FreeCAD,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------

Designing a 1600 sq ft barndominium can be both exciting and rewarding. With a compact space, you have the chance to infuse your personality and creativity into every corner. Here are various creative design ideas to make the most of your barndominium floor plan, ensuring it boasts big style while maintaining the essence of compact living.

### Open-Concept Living Space

The first idea is to embrace an open-concept layout. This design choice allows seamless flow between the kitchen, dining, and living areas. You can remove unnecessary walls to create a spacious feeling, even in a smaller footprint. Use large windows to invite natural light, making the area feel larger and more inviting.

### Multifunctional Spaces

In a barndominium, every square foot counts. Consider creating multifunctional spaces that serve multiple purposes. For instance:

- **Convertible furniture:** Invest in a sofa bed or extendable dining table to adapt the space for guests.
- **Work and play areas:** Design a home office nook that can double as a study area for kids.
- **Garage and workshop:** If you‚Äôre a hobbyist, allocate part of your garage for a workshop, combining utility with function.

### Natural and Sustainable Materials

Using natural materials can enhance the charm of your barndominium. Consider incorporating reclaimed wood for beams and accents, which adds character while being eco-friendly. Also, choose materials such as stone, metal, and glass to stay true to the rustic aesthetic while providing a modern feel.

### Smart Storage Solutions

Efficient storage is essential for compact living. Make use of the vertical space by installing shelves that extend up to the ceiling. Here are a few additional tips:

- **Built-in cabinetry:** Integrate cabinetry into walls for a clean, seamless look.
- **Wall hooks and racks:** Utilize wall space in entryways and hallways for coats and bags.
- **Under-stair storage:** If your design includes stairs, the space underneath can be perfectly transformed into a closet or small workspace.

### Outdoor Living Enhancements

Expand your living area outdoors with a well-planned patio, deck, or porch. Since you have a smaller interior space, creating a cozy outdoor environment can enhance your lifestyle. This can serve as an extra area for dining or entertaining friends. Consider including:

- **Outdoor furniture:** Choose durable and weather-resistant options for comfort.
- **Fire pit:** Incorporate a fire pit for warmth and ambiance during cooler evenings.
- **Gardens and green spaces:** Plant flowers, herbs, or vegetables to blend nature into your home.

### Personalized Decor

Personal touches can make your barndominium feel like home. Use artwork, textiles, and home decor that reflect your style. For example:

- **Wall art:** Hang family photos or art pieces that mean something to you.
- **Textiles:** Incorporate rugs, cushions, and throws that add color and warmth.
- **Lighting fixtures:** Unique lighting can enhance the ambiance and style of your spaces, making them feel inviting.

### Thoughtful Color Palettes

Choosing the right color palette can be transformative. Light colors tend to make a space feel larger; think soft grays, whites, or pastels. You can add bolder colors through accent walls or furnishings to create depth and interest.

### Incorporate Technology

Consider technological advancements when designing your barndominium. Smart home features can enhance comfort and convenience. Options like smart thermostats, lighting systems, and security features streamline your daily routine.

By implementing these creative design ideas into your 1600 sq ft barndominium floor plan, you‚Äôll be able to enjoy compact living without sacrificing style. With a little creativity and thoughtful planning, your barndominium will be a beautiful, functional retreat that reflects your personal taste and lifestyle.

Benefits of Compact Living in a Barndominium Style Home
-------------------------------------------------------

When considering a new home, many homeowners are discovering the charm and practicality of barndominiums. These stylish, versatile structures combine the rustic appeal of barns with the comfort and modern amenities of traditional homes. Compact living in a barndominium offers a range of benefits that can enhance your lifestyle, making it an attractive option for many.

### Efficient Use of Space

One of the primary benefits of living in a barndominium is the efficient use of space. With a typical size of around 1600 sq ft, these homes are designed to maximize every square foot. Open floor plans allow for flexibility in arranging furniture and using the area for various purposes. This means you can seamlessly blend your living room, dining area, and kitchen into one cohesive space.

### Cost-Effective Living

Barndominiums are often more affordable to build than traditional homes. The materials used for their construction, such as metal siding and roofing, tend to be less expensive and more durable. Additionally, the lower square footage means that heating, cooling, and maintenance costs are significantly reduced, resulting in cost-effective living over time.

#### Lower Energy Bills

- Compact homes require less energy to heat and cool.
- Modern insulation can keep your home comfortable year-round.
- Energy-efficient appliances can further reduce utility costs.

### Flexibility in Design

Another exciting aspect of barndominium living is the flexibility in design. You can customize the layout to fit your needs and tastes. Whether you prefer an open concept or distinct rooms, the choice is yours. Since many barndominiums have high ceilings, you can incorporate loft spaces for additional storage or a guest area, adding valuable living space without increasing your home‚Äôs footprint.

### Simplified Maintenance

Living in a smaller space means less maintenance overall. With fewer rooms to clean and maintain, you can spend more time enjoying your home and less time worrying about upkeep. The materials used for barndominiums, like metal siding, typically require less maintenance than wood siding, helping to prolong the life of your home with less effort.

### Connection to Nature

Barndominiums are often located on larger plots of land, providing homeowners with a close connection to nature. Imagine waking up to the sounds of birds and enjoying your morning coffee on a porch with a panoramic view of rolling fields or sprawling forests. This connection to the outdoors can significantly enhance your quality of life, providing a peaceful escape from the hustle and bustle of city living.

### Eco-Friendly Living

Many barndominium builders are now focusing on sustainable construction practices. By using recycled materials and energy-efficient designs, you can minimize your carbon footprint. The compact size of these homes also contributes to lower consumption of resources, making them an environmentally responsible choice for modern living.

### Community and Lifestyle

Choosing to live in a barndominium often means choosing a lifestyle that embraces community and simplicity. Many barndo owners find themselves in close-knit communities that celebrate the rural lifestyle. This lifestyle fosters relationships with neighbors and allows for a sense of belonging that can be hard to find in more urban environments.

### Adapting to Life Changes

Compact living in a barndominium can be particularly advantageous for those who anticipate changes in their lifestyles. Whether you‚Äôre a young couple starting a family, empty nesters looking to downsize, or individuals wanting a second home, a barndominium offers the flexibility you need to adapt to different life stages.

### Style Meets Functionality

Last but not least, barndominiums are the epitome of style meeting functionality. These homes can be designed in various styles, from sleek and modern to rustic and cozy. You can create a space that truly reflects your personality while enjoying the many practical benefits of compact living. With the right design choices, you can have a beautiful home that remains practical and livable.

In a world where space and resources are often at a premium, compact living in a barndominium style home presents a solution that embraces modern needs with timeless charm. By harnessing the benefits of these well-thought-out spaces, you can enjoy a stylish, efficient, and fulfilling way of life.

### Conclusion

Embracing the beauty and functionality of 1600 sq ft barndominium floor plans allows you to enjoy a unique blend of creative design and efficient living. These homes are not only aesthetically appealing but also offer sustainable living solutions that prioritize open spaces and a fluid lifestyle. By incorporating innovative design elements, such as multi-functional rooms, soaring ceilings, and large windows, you can transform your barndominium into a stylish retreat that reflects your personality and meets your daily needs.

Compact living in a barndominium offers numerous benefits. It encourages an intentional lifestyle, where every square foot is utilized effectively without compromising on style. This minimalist approach not only reduces maintenance and utility costs but also leads to a more organized and less cluttered existence. The modern farmhouse ambiance of barndominiums fosters a sense of tranquility and comfort that is often hard to find in larger homes.

As you contemplate your dream domicile, consider how a 1600 sq ft barndominium can fulfill both your practical needs and aesthetic desires. With thoughtful design choices, you can create an inviting atmosphere that maximizes space and offers a stylish solution to contemporary living. Whether you are looking to downsize or simply seek an efficient design that doesn‚Äôt skimp on charm, these floor plans are a perfect choice. Your dream of compact living with big style is well within reach, and the possibilities are endless. Start planning your ideal barndominium today and experience the joy of living simply without sacrificing sophistication.",1,1748497375.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

Nope I didn‚Äôt clean it all up, in fact I didn‚Äôt clean at all I only woke up like 30 maybe 45 minutes ago

Beat

See I was confused too but then I found this note

Beat

Yeah apparently my roommate came in to wake me up so I could help them clean but when they saw us in bed they left, then woke up all of the people who passed out here last night and forced them to help clean,

beat

Oh so you know my roommate Sam? (jokingly) I‚Äôm so sorry

Beat

Oh so you don‚Äôt really know them, they just approached you out of the blue and invited you to the party last night?

Beat

That sounds like Sam all right they‚Äôre a bit eccentric but I think you‚Äôll like them. unless you don't, which is entirely possible. opinions on them are very divided

Beat

I‚Äôll have to thank them for inviting you. Anyways, Sam's out driving the people who passed out home, says they won‚Äôt be back for a while, winky face? Now this is weird they actually wrote out the words winky face instead of like drawing one that doesn't make any sense.

Wait why‚Äôre you blushing I haven‚Äôt done anything-ooh wait a minute they think that we‚Ä¶well‚Ä¶y‚Äôknow

Y‚Äôknow you really shouldn‚Äôt apologize for things that aren‚Äôt your fault

Don‚Äôt apologize for apologizing and don‚Äôt you dare try to apologize for apologizing for your apology

(hopefully) y‚Äôknow actually we‚Äôre getting worried over something that only might have even happened. Sam may not have actually told anyone, let me just ask them real quick-oh‚Ä¶oh no. yeah they told people they‚Ä¶they definitely told people. my phone is exploding. If it wasn‚Äôt on silent it would have vibrated off of the table and out of the door‚Ä¶shit this is actually pretty bad sharp inhale exasperated exhale I'm gonna call them I'm gonna call them right now I'm calling them

Goddamn you Sam you cantankerous buffoon I will have your head for this

wipe that smirk off your face

Beat

I know we‚Äôre on the phone but I can hear it in your voice

Beat

No I am not mad because they ‚Äúhit it and quit it‚Äù as you‚Äôve so elegantly put it because 1. they‚Äôre right here and 2. we did nothing of the sort you insensitive jerk

Beat

What am I angry about? What am I angry about! I‚Äôll tell you what I‚Äôm angry about you vile fool! Due to your big mouth we‚Äôre going to be up to our necks in baseless rumors

Beat

Yeah they‚Äôre baseless none of what people are saying is anywhere close to the truth

Beat

Then why were we in bed together? Because there was only one! it was a classic ‚Äúoh no there‚Äôs only one bed scenario‚Äù

Beat

No Sam, a one-bedder is not inherently romantic and you damn well know that. Remember the hotel in Miami?

Beat

Exactly, now whenever you get back here today you are going to help me fix this mess. capiche

Beat

Cool, see you later, bye

(call end sound effect)

deep breath (no longer angry) Alright I‚Äôm gonna post something so I can at least start the process of dispelling the rumors let me just ‚ÄúSam is a lying scoundrel and under no circumstances should their word be trusted in any way shape or form‚Äù there posted

Beat

What‚Äôs wrong you‚Äôre looking at me weird

Beat

Yeah I‚Äôm usually a lot more calm and composed than that but normally Sam's antics don‚Äôt involve people who didn‚Äôt sign up for their shenaniganry

Short beat

small sigh Look, you didn‚Äôt ask for this and it‚Äôs all my fault that this is happening is there anything I could do to make it up to you

Beat

Yes I do need to make it up to you

Beat

‚ÄúYou could use a ride to work‚Äù? Didn‚Äôt you drive here?

beat

You walked to the party?

Beat

Huh I thought you drove, guess not

Beat

Well anyway I can definitely give you a ride. When do you need to be there?

Beat

Oh yeah I have the time, right here

Beat

What! You‚Äôve gotta be there that soon!?! how far away is it

Beat

Ok‚Ä¶ok that‚Äôs doable do you need to stop by your house to get your uniform or anything?

Beat ok then yeah I think we can definitely make it but how are you going to get home if you don‚Äôt have your-(the speaker gets an idea) oh now there's an idea

Beat

How about this, when do you get off?

Beat

Ok I‚Äôll pick you up and then, since simply driving you to work doesn‚Äôt exactly make up for the trouble I‚Äôve caused you, how about I take you‚Ä¶ somewhere as an apology

Beat

Not necessarily like a date, not unless you want it to be‚Ä¶ just kidding unless‚Ä¶

Beat

You‚Äôre right, we do not have the time for me to keep messing with you even though it‚Äôs delightful and you look adorable when I do it.

Beat

Oops sorry I just did it again

Beat

Cool now let‚Äôs get out of here because there‚Äôs a certain cutie that needs to be on time for work and I need to brainstorm where to take you tonight (under your breath) should I ask Sam?

I have an appointment booked just to check but thought I'd ask here for some general advice.

I never really looked at my blood pressure as I'm 32 but happen to do it recently at my parents house and not sure how to feel I guess.

When measuring about a week ago, I don't think I was doing it right but it showed approx 135/75-85. Since then I've done a few measurements with 2 days ago, came home about 5pm and measured 133/85 and 136/81 which probably wasn't too much later after I had a coffee. Note quickly that a couple of the readings have been 130-135/70-75.

Today I randomly came home early at midday and decided to measure and it came back 150/90-95 but this was soon after eating. I've never previously measured at this time.

I have read online measuring midday is generally always higher and after food but what is your thoughts?

Edit: not sure if this changes anything but after my initial readings, I decided to get back into the gym the past 4 days. I'm still sore from the first 4 days so don't know if that impacts anything.",1,1748496645.0,bloodpressure,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôve built a soft, meaningful life for myself‚Äîone full of warmth and growth and quiet joys. I‚Äôm not looking for someone to complete me. I‚Äôm whole.

But still‚Ä¶ some nights.  
Especially lately.

I find myself craving something simpler, quieter than love.

I crave *companionship*. The comfort of being around someone who sees you‚Äînot just the version you show the world, but the little things. Someone who notices how you hum while making dinner, how your eyes light up when you talk about that one random thing you‚Äôre passionate about. Someone who laughs at your weird jokes. Someone who‚Äôs just... *there.*

Not romance. Not drama. Just presence.

I miss the shared silences. Sharing a meal without needing to fill every second with conversation. Sitting on the couch, legs tangled, watching a show you don‚Äôt even like that much because the company makes it better. Sharing a knowing look when something funny happens. That feeling of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm here, and so are you, and this moment matters, even if we say nothing.‚Äù

Some nights I come home and I know I‚Äôll turn the key, step inside, and the house will be quiet. Peaceful, but also‚Ä¶ a little lonely. And I‚Äôll sit with myself, like I always do. I‚Äôll light a candle, play music, maybe read a chapter of something lovely. And I‚Äôll feel grateful for my own company‚Äîbecause I‚Äôve earned that comfort.

But there‚Äôs still a little corner of my heart that whispers,  
*Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice to share this?*

Not because I need to, but because I *want* to.  
Because sometimes, the deepest yearning isn‚Äôt for grand love stories‚Äîbut for someone to look at you across the table, smile softly, and stay. Someone who chooses you in the little ways. Who reaches for your hand just because.

So yeah‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm happy on my own.  
But I miss being gently known.  
And if you‚Äôre in this space too‚Äîif your heart is healing, whole, and still softly hoping‚Äîjust know you‚Äôre not alone.

I wrote a poem about this part of the journey. If you‚Äôve ever felt it too, I hope these words find you in a kind and healing way.

**Whole, But Still Hoping**

I‚Äôve built a life that feels like mine,  
With morning walks and books and time.  
I‚Äôve learned to laugh when no one‚Äôs near,  
To hold myself through every fear.

I set the table just for one,  
I dance alone when day is done.  
The quiet isn‚Äôt quite so loud,  
I wear my solitude like proud.

I smile at sunsets on my own,  
I‚Äôve found a joy I‚Äôve never known.  
And yet‚Ä¶ some nights, a whisper stays‚Äî  
A longing tucked between my days.

Not for a fairytale or flame,  
Not someone just to know my name‚Äî  
But for a voice beside my tea,  
A hand that simply says, ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Someone to share a tired sigh,  
To sit in silence, you and I.  
A steady heart, a softer gaze,  
A warmth that stays on colder days.

I‚Äôm not undone, I‚Äôm not in need,  
My heart no longer aches to plead.  
But still it beats with something true‚Äî  
The wish to share this life I grew.

And if you feel this quiet too,  
This space where love once gently flew‚Äî  
Then know you‚Äôre not alone tonight.  
We‚Äôre stars apart, but share one light.

If this resonates with you, I‚Äôm sending you so much warmth.  
Even if we‚Äôre healing in our own corners of the world,  
there‚Äôs something beautiful in knowing we‚Äôre not alone in the way we feel.",1,1748496364.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

1ky2sv1,https://v.redd.it/64n0iyu3pn3f1,Single filter issues [sage express impress],"Hi all, the single filter of my express impress is acting weird lately. I have no issue at all with the double filter. 

I am grinding medium roast coffee at grind setting 15/16, which is not particularly fine at all and I get the result in the video. Notice that the filter starts dripping water still during the pre infusion step, before the pressure ramps up so tbh grinding coarser seems the wrong thing to do. The coffee splashes a lot although the pressure seems ok. Extraction time is less than 20 seconds from when the pressure goes up. 

Note that with a double filter, everything else being the same, I grind down to 13 and the extraction looks flawless. Honey-like stream of delicious coffee, although I never get to that 25/30 seconds sweet spot. 

Am I doing something wrong? Is the single filter ruined somehow? I keep it clean regularly by soaking it in water. Is there an issue with the coffee? It‚Äôs 1-2 weeks roasted.

What strikes me is that this behaviour was not apparent to me until a few weeks ago, had the machine for several months. So I‚Äôm inclined to say this issue emerged with usage of the machine rather than having always been there. ",2,1748496289.0,espresso,8,1.0,False

No alcohol burst at all and just after 15 seconds of spraying it , expect the whole room to fill up with a very rich and dark espresso like fragrance. 


Best way to put it , imagine your house is inside a coffee machine or imagine you crushed coffee beans and scrubbed your whole body with it , I have tried a few coffee based frag before but some way or the other there's always a synthetic touch to it but this? Nope not at all , this is the closest you'll ever get to finding the perfect coffee accord fragrance.


I love layering this with choco musk and trust me if you're a gourmand lover you'll adore this combination, I believe layering it with a sweet frag would do the deal as well.


The projection is pretty much amazing with around 2 hours 

The longevity : I could smell it for over 8 hours on skin and almost a whole day on clothes and it stays pretty strong for the initial 4 hours (4 sprays)

1ky2oyh,https://i.redd.it/4wzb81nr8n3f1.png,Need tips for a NON-INFINITE world,"Hello everyone, first of all I hope you are well.

This post will probably make you laugh a little (I hope so) this probably is just a silly question. but well, as you can see in the image, I'm trying to create my own open world. I've made some assets including this map using Blender and a heightmap made in Gimp. (I have more heightmaps but i choose this for example)

I was so satisfied with the results until I realized a little big detail, this world was too heavy to be playable! first I thought it was the size of the world but I quickly discarded it, it doesn't matter if it's 100 meters, 1000 or 50km if it was well optimized the size doesn't really matter at all, otherwise open worlds wouldn't exist, I mean, only skyrim's map is about 37km, just to give an example.

It was then when a magic question appeared.... ‚ÄúWhat the (Bad Word) is a chunk?‚Äù since it is a completely square map, I can divide it in equal parts for example: chunks of 100x100 or 500x500 meters, it doesn't really matter how big it is as long as the load is the same and stable on each chunk, but how can I put them in the godot editor without breaking the editor itself, should I export them in separate meshes like ""Chunk\_0\_0, Chunk\_0\_1""? I can create different LODs but how do I connect them together? how do I tell the engine to generate, change or hide them at a certain distance from the player?

I heard somewhere that for large worlds you have to move the world instead of the player... Just what?

First thing i do it's not overthink about, took a breath and then went to make myself a cup of coffee. the best thing would be to look for solutions, ideas or inspiration on the internet (or just relax for a bit listen music while I was thinking by myself) but that's when I ran into another problem, the only thing I found was ‚ÄúHOW TO CREATE INFINITE WORLDS‚Äù ‚ÄúCREATE YOUR INFINITE PROCEDURAL WORLD WITH ONLY 4 CLICKS‚Äù ‚ÄúCreate your own world with Minecraft style generation‚Äù.

Yes, you can imagine my face in that moment. I mean, infinite worlds sounds appealing but it's not what I'm looking for my project. And yes, I'm probably being overly ambitious for something of this size, but it really doesn't matter, difficult challenges are most fun. That's why I have no plans to give up and haven't even considered it. Once you start walking why you should stop?

If you've read this far, I sincerely appreciate your time. I'd love to hear your thoughts and any advice you have. I don't really need a guide to take me by the hand, but any kind of support, even if it's just moral, will be appreciated.",18,1748495866.0,godot,18,0.87,False

Noida, India ‚Äì May 2025: The third showcase of the 9th Global Fashion and Design Week Noida 2025 held at Marwah Studios turned out to be the most captivating and immersive presentation yet, reaffirming the global relevance and artistic depth of this unique fashion and design celebration.



Festival President Dr. Sandeep Marwah, also the Founder of Noida Film City, proudly stated, ‚ÄúWe believe in nurturing creativity and giving complete freedom to our artists. This event is not merely about fashion; it‚Äôs a tribute to global heritage and individual expression through the medium of art and design.‚Äù He added that this year, over 80 countries are represented, showcasing 550 unique garments, 125 pieces of designer furniture, 6 art and fashion exhibitions, 250 designers, and numerous cultural activities. The scale of preparation was extraordinary, with over 500 professionals and students working diligently for more than 60 days to bring the spectacle to life.



The third session featured distinguished Guests of Honour who added immense value to the celebration: Ankit Jain, Business Leader and Innovator, Anuj Chabhra, Design Consultant, Supriya Munshi, Style Analyst and Brand Strategist, Kaushik Ghosh, Fashion Personality, Kirti Mishra Naran, Creative Director and Cultural Curator.



One of the highlights of the evening was the official launch of the coffee table book titled ‚ÄúFashion as an Art‚Äù authored by Ms. Ishaani Duggal, which eloquently documented fashion‚Äôs evolution as a cultural force and visual language.



The runway sparkled with breathtaking country-themed collections crafted by AAFT School of Fashion and Design students: Hansika presented an elegant High Fashion line for Slovakia, Mehak represented Lesotho with stylish Smart Casuals, Varsha amazed with Haute Couture inspired by Morocco, Meenakshi evoked the flair of Lebanon through Cocktail Wear, Jtoyi embraced Malaysia with a sophisticated Smart Casual collection, Anjali Bohra brought Serbia to life through Traditional Wear, Deepali beautifully showcased Turkey‚Äôs heritage attire, Rashid Dev and Manshi collaborated to display Street Wear from the USA, Tamanna rounded off the show with a rich array of Indian Traditional Wear.



Each presentation was not just a display of fashion but an act of storytelling‚Äîfusing fabric, design, and emotion into a powerful narrative. The creative synergy between global culture and local craftsmanship was on full display, turning the runway into a bridge of unity and diversity.



The day marked yet another triumph for AAFT‚Äôs Global Fashion and Design Week, placing it firmly among the most vibrant educational fashion forums in the world.

Does any employee know if sales are down or is corporate getting negative responses enough to maybe change this policy?

I ask because my spouse was a loyal customer for over 15 years.  They would routinely go there to drink tea/coffee and sit outside talking quietly with her family.  Maybe just read and enjoy the day.  However, she stopped patronizing Starbucks when she saw employees deny a homeless man water.

I know it is not ""illegal"" to deny water as a business.  However, it is unethical as a multi-billion corporation to not allow their workers to provide it.

She already wrote to complain to the company.  However, we both know just one or even a 1,000 letters are not going to change this new policy. 

Are any employees defying this new policy?  What are the thoughts of employees about it?

Hopefully the policy will fade away either because of new corporate leadership or stores just not carrying anymore.

Era una actividad acad√©mica, dur√≥ casi 10 horas . Hasta ah√≠ todo normal: auditorio, charlas, exposiciones, coffee break, etc.

Despu√©s de una de las charlas me separ√© un poco de mi grupo. Me fui a recorrer un pasillo donde tienen cuadros, maquetas, billetes antiguos‚Ä¶ parec√≠a una especie de mini museo. Me qued√© mirando los detalles, los nombres, las fechas. Un rato me olvid√© de todo.

Me di cuenta de que ya era hora del break. Me dijeron que ser√≠a cerca del auditorio, as√≠ que fui caminando por un pasillo lateral para cortar camino. Vi una puerta sin cartel, cre√≠ que era una salida de emergencia y pas√© sin golpear.

Error.

Era una sala, con alfombras rojas y luces suaves. Un palco VIP. Y no estaba vac√≠a.

Hab√≠an cuatro personas ah√≠. Trajes caros, relojes finos, rostros que dan esa sensaci√≥n de poder sin tener que decir una palabra. Me vieron. El ambiente se congel√≥. Uno de ellos gir√≥ lentamente hacia m√≠, y cuando lo hizo‚Ä¶ su rostro parpade√≥.

Fue como una falla en una proyecci√≥n. Por menos de un segundo, lo que vi no era una cara humana. Era algo m√°s largo, m√°s ovalado, cubierto de escamas. Verde amarillento. Sus ojos eran negros completos, como dos pozos sin fondo.

Pens√© que era mi imaginaci√≥n. Pero otro ‚Äîel que estaba de pie mirando desde el palco‚Äî se estaba ajustando el cuello de la camisa y lo vi con claridad: sus manos cambiaban. Entre un parpadeo y otro, se alternaban entre manos humanas y algo m√°s... huesudo, afilado, como garras suaves. Las u√±as eran demasiado largas. La piel, irregular, h√∫meda.

No hablaron. No dijeron una palabra. Pero **sent√≠ que estaban comunic√°ndose. No conmigo, sino con mi mente.**  
Ideas que no eran m√≠as empezaron a aparecer, como susurros que se deslizaban por la parte de atr√°s de mi cr√°neo.

Solo me miraron. No con sorpresa. Sino con algo peor: reconocimiento. Como si supieran qui√©n era yo. Como si me hubieran estado esperando.

No entend√≠a las palabras, pero el mensaje era claro: *""Ya viste demasiado.""*

Me congel√©.

Cerr√© la puerta sin decir una palabra. Me alej√© caminando r√°pido, intentando no correr. Llegu√© al refrigerio con la boca seca, tratando de actuar normal. Nadie del grupo hab√≠a visto gente en ese palco.

Esa noche so√±√© con ojos negros observ√°ndome desde el palco. Y lo peor es que, desde entonces, siento que en la calle, en el bus, alguien siempre me est√° mirando.

[BDB + NZ + DF64]","So I'll start by admitting that I had become a little complacent with cleaning my equipment (young kids will do that to your priorities). It'd been MONTHS and MONTHS since I last cleaned my grinders and I'd only been doing the cleaning cycle on the BDB when it told me to.

Anyway, the BDB had been hassling me about running the descale cycle and I'd recently taken a short (1 week) hiatus from caffeine (for health reasons). So I figured now was as good a time as any to deep clean. I started by running the descale cycle on my BDB (WITHOUT using descaling solution, I use espresso water so doing actual descaling is unnecessary). I then ran a clean cycle. I also took apart and thoroughly cleaned out both of my grinders (side note: for how long it'd been since I'd last cleaned them, I'd expected my grinders to be a lot worse than they actually were).

Pulled a shot (light roast, turbo blooming, 1:4 ratio) and WOW! I mean my coffee is generally pretty good regardless, but the difference in the clarity was NOTICEABLE. There had also been a subtle ""funk"" that I typically got on all my (light roast) shots, regardless of the bean, that I'd kinda just gotten used to (and even sorta enjoyed). After the cleaning, that funk was GONE and I actually tasted the notes that were called out on the bag.

So yeah..

We got him when he was only 6 weeks old and started socializing him right away.. we would take him every where with us, coffee shops, bars, festivals, restaurants... and didn‚Äôt have any issues, but there have been a couple of situations within the past few months where he snapped at a stranger that tried to pet him (even if he acts like he wants to be pet at first).. now I have anxiety bringing him anywhere because I don‚Äôt want him to do that to the wrong person. He has never hurt anyone but he looks like a big wolf so it can be frightening when he snaps, and unfortunately some people don‚Äôt even ask before they go to pet him. He is great with other dogs and we never have any issues at doggie daycare or the park but he is unpredictable with people, even with my husband and I. If we pick up a paper towel off the ground, he will lunge at us and growl. If you pet him when he is tired, he will bite/growl. He also seems to have night terrors because if he is sleeping and you walk past him and wake him up, he will sometimes jump up and bite. He doesn‚Äôt bite down as hard as he could but will leave marks and bruises at times. He has always been very bitey.. when he was younger, he broke skin because his teeth were razor sharp.. I thought he‚Äôd grow out of that but seems like he hasn‚Äôt and it just doesn‚Äôt hurt as bad now that he doesn‚Äôt have the puppy teeth. We go on long walks, I take him to the park for hours, he plays all day at daycare so he shouldn‚Äôt be acting out because he has energy‚Ä¶ maybe he is overly tired? I‚Äôve tried redirecting to toys, positive reinforcement with treats, putting him in timeout, turning around or walking out of the room, whimpering like he hurt me, sternly  telling him no.. it just seems like nothing works.

Every month, I set aside rs. 3000 just for stupid, impulse purchases. Stuff I know I‚Äôll probably regret later ‚Äî like random Swiggy orders (once I was craving Sushi and ordered it for 1.8k, had to eat daal chawal to not feel hungry), a 4th phone case I don‚Äôt need, overpriced coffee, etc.

Instead of trying to be this perfectly disciplined person (which never worked), I just accepted that I‚Äôll mess up sometimes. But now it‚Äôs within limits. And strangely, having this budget has actually reduced how much I impulse spend. Half the time I don‚Äôt even use it fully.

What changed:

I feel less guilty after a dumb purchase, because I planned for it.

I pause before buying, and ask myself ‚Äî ""is this worth my regret budget?""

I'm actually saving more overall, just because I'm more aware.


It‚Äôs a small mindset shift but it made a big difference. Would recommend trying it if you struggle with random spending like I did. Curious if anyone else does something like this?

1ky1yan,https://www.reddit.com/r/keto/comments/1ky1yan/after_a_month_on_a_continuous_glucose_monitor/,After a month on a Continuous Glucose Monitor (Stelo) and what I've learned.,"First off Stelo is a over the counter version of the Dexcom 7. The Dexcom 7 can be adjusted to better match your blood sugar and is a medical device so it can be used to trigger insulin dispersal. The Stelo is not adjustable and is not accurate enough to rely on for such purposes.  

**The Good.** 

These are overwhelmingly the most beneficial for identifying problematic foods that could be spiking your blood sugar. Low carb products, diabetes products, sugar free products, etc. It also puts your mind at ease on things you thought might be spiking your blood sugar that aren't.

My buddy has the dawn phenomenon and his blood sugar spikes a lot in the morning. He can use this to track his spikes and try different things to mitigate them. 

They are pretty much painless to attach and come with an applicator which makes it super easy. They are only FDA approved for sticking to the back of the arm and they come with an adhesive sticker attached to the device and over patch to better hold the device on. Under ideal situations they last for 15 days with another 12 hour grace period to switch out the device for another. 

They sell patches on Amazon that can go over the device and better secure it to your arm.

If the device fails prematurely or doesn't attach correctly, contact the company for a replacement.

**The Bad**

They aren't super accurate and usually have a delay of about 20 minutes compared to a finger test but are way off when it comes to lab testing, especially if you are not on insulin. There are studies that outline that for people not on insulin, the GMI (which is the CGM's equivalent of A1c) is pretty far off. There is a GMI to A1c calculator and it was .4 points higher than the labs I got while wearing it. Granted I didn't wear one for a full 90 days but my blood sugar average on the app was always higher than it should have been. The average blood glucose doesn't match the A1c average for it, which is why they came up with the GMI number. Using the average blood glucose reading on the app and using the A1c average for that same number, my A1C would have been closer to .8 higher than it was in my labs. So the GMI number is better but still off. Basically, don't use average blood glucose to estimate your A1c or it will be way off.

You need a different app to access the GMI number (clarity app) as well as save data from one CGM to the next. The Stelo app itself doesn't save your data once you switch devices. 

If you lay on the device, the pressure can cause your blood glucose to drop rapidly and then when you reduce pressure, it will go back up. This is normal so I try to place the device in a location where I won't lay on it for best accuracy.

If you are using the device in an unapproved location on your body, you may not get your device replaced if it fails early but some people have reported better accuracy and better chance of it lasting the full 15 days in different spots. 

You can knock your device loose. My first device I bumped it on the side of my car door and it stopped working, that's why those extra patches they sell on amazon are good as well as figuring out the best location to attach it. 

Supposedly the sensor that gets inserted into your arm isn't always attached to the needle and is a known issue with these devices. If you see that, the device is defective and the threaded sensor won't insert when you go to attach the device and you'll get an instant error and device failure. Best to not even try to attach it if you see the thread has separated. 

Supposedly there is a limit to how many replacements you can get through device failures but it didn't happen to me, it was just something I read on another post online.   
  
**Things to be aware of.** 

The CGM takes a while to get warmed up, usually 25 minutes or so but it also takes longer sometimes several hours to be relatively accurate. I thought I got a defective one because it was displaying a ridiculously low blood sugar at first but it just took time to display correctly. 

Showering always causes a rapid spike in the readings followed by a rapid decrease. This is normal but freaked me out the first time I saw it. 

Save or take a picture of the container the device comes in. It is required for Bluetooth but also for requesting a new device if yours fails. 

You will get a warning message through the app if you have what they consider a spike. It's set up by the app on default. If you do not get that message they do not consider it enough of a spike to matter apparently. I regularly would see my blood sugar steadily rise 30 points before starting to decrease back to baseline and these are not considered spikes. When I ate some potato chips, I saw a rapid spike of 90 points and that registered as a spike on the app. I figure (for me) that 30 point spikes are effectively not worth worrying about. I'm sure everyone is different in this regard but that's just my experience. 

Exercise, working, activity, sweating, being hot, all tend to raise blood sugar. The first time I saw a big raise I was fasting and thought I was sensitive to caffeine in black coffee because it was the only thing I had that morning. Nope, turns out I'm not sensitive to caffeine, I was just working hard and my blood sugar spiked. If you eat something and immediately do some work, even light activity, if you see a spike it might be your activity not your food. Test foods when you are lounging around for the best accuracy. 

**Overall**

These are not accurate enough to track your blood sugar numbers but they work really well for identifying spikes and trends in your blood sugar... for recognizing patterns or for testing foods. Essentially, don't use them to estimate your A1c or average blood sugar. If you are trying to introduce back in some carbs or figure out how many berries with whip cream will spike your blood sugar, they are excellent for that purpose. If you want to know if the keto bread you purchased is really detrimental to your weight loss, then get one of these. The finger tests can work but they are so much more of a hassle to test every time you eat something. These are expensive... about 50 dollars for 15 days but now that I've  essentially eliminated all the harmful foods from my diet, I can stick with foods that I know are good. It's more just a peace of mind that I'm doing everything correctly. I hope this helps if any of you consider getting one. ",13,1748493190.0,keto,3,0.93,False

The world of nutrition saw a flurry of activity on May 28, 2025, with experts weighing in on everything from fat storage indicators to viral diet trends and the secrets behind maintaining a youthful appearance. This overview compiles the key developments, offering a comprehensive look at the most significant takeaways from the day's nutrition news.

**Understanding the Body's Warning Signs: Fat Storage and Health**

A primary focus of the day‚Äôs nutrition news was understanding the body‚Äôs signals related to fat storage. Edwina Raj, Head of Services - Clinical Nutrition & Dietetics at Aster CMI Hospital, Bangalore, shed light on five key warning signs that indicate the body may be accumulating excess fat, particularly visceral fat, which is stored around the internal organs.

*   **Increased Waist Circumference:** A waist size exceeding 40 inches for men or 35 inches for women is a strong indicator of visceral fat accumulation.
*   **Fatigue or Low Energy Levels:** Excess fat, especially visceral fat, can lead to inflammation and hormonal imbalances, causing persistent tiredness.
*   **Difficulty Breathing or Snoring:** Extra fat around the neck or chest can cause sleep apnea or labored breathing, impacting sleep quality and overall health.

These indicators highlight the importance of monitoring not just weight, but also body composition and overall health. This information reinforces the need for a holistic approach to health and wellness, recognizing that diet, exercise, and lifestyle factors all play crucial roles.

**Debunking Dietary Myths: Reality vs. Social Media Claims**

The prevalence of misinformation on social media platforms prompted experts to debunk several popular dietary myths. The trend of quick fixes and miracle cures led to scrutiny of common claims and recommendations, the news summaries highlighted the importance of critical thinking and relying on evidence-based information.

One specific claim addressed was the use of raw honey to heal scars. Dr. Shireen Furtado, senior consultant in medical and cosmetic dermatology at Aster CMI Hospital, Bangalore, directly refuted this claim. Dr. Furtado cautioned against using raw honey on wounds due to the potential presence of ""inadvertent bacteria,"" which could lead to infection. She emphasized the importance of using ""anti-microbial ointments that have proven results"" rather than risking infection.

This emphasis on scientific validation underscores a critical message for consumers: health information found online, especially regarding dietary remedies, should be approached with caution. Before adopting any new dietary strategy, it is essential to consult with a healthcare professional and verify claims with reliable sources.

**The Power of Protein: Beyond Muscle Building**

Protein was a central topic of conversation, with an emphasis on its broader role in health and wellness. The news summaries acknowledged the common perception of protein as solely associated with muscle building, but expanded on the many other benefits of protein consumption.

The importance of protein for overall health goes far beyond building muscle. Protein is crucial for:

*   **Satiety and Energy Regulation:** Protein helps in feeling full after eating, regulating blood sugar levels, and promoting steady energy levels.
*   **Hormone Production, Skin Health, Immune Function, and Sleep:** It supports hormone production, maintains healthy skin, boosts immune function, and even affects sleep quality.

The article emphasized that one does not need to eat like an athlete or rely on processed supplements to get enough protein. Instead, the focus should be on incorporating real, satisfying protein sources into daily meals, emphasizing a natural and enjoyable dietary approach.

**The Diet of Youth: A Look at Anti-Aging Strategies**

The final significant development in nutrition news was a spotlight on dietary habits potentially linked to maintaining youthfulness. This was based on a viral Instagram video from a Korean woman, Hannah, whose 62-year-old father appears significantly younger than his age.

Hannah's video delved into her father's daily eating habits, highlighting a disciplined and intriguing routine. Key aspects of the diet include:

*   **Black Coffee and Banana-Topped Cabbage Salad:** These form key parts of the routine.
*   **Soy Milk Matcha Lattes:** This is a core liquid component of the diet.
*   **Low in Dairy, Sugar, and Red Meat:** A restrictive diet which points towards potentially beneficial health effects.

While specific details of the dietary plan were not fully elaborated on in the news summaries, the focus on limiting dairy, sugar, and red meat, alongside emphasizing whole, unprocessed foods, highlights a potentially effective anti-aging approach. This emphasis on whole food ingredients and a healthy lifestyle showcases how dietary and overall lifestyle choices can influence both health and the appearance of age.

**Conclusion: A Day of Informed Nutrition**

The nutrition news from May 28, 2025, provides valuable insights into several critical areas of health and wellness. From understanding the body's signals of fat storage to debunking harmful dietary myths, and highlighting the power of protein and the dietary habits potentially associated with youthfulness. These developments emphasized the importance of informed choices.

1ky1sza,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegetablegardening/comments/1ky1sza/apartment_gardening_in_nyc_is_very_specific/,"Apartment gardening in NYC is very specific, everything is inside and space is small. My first questions are about avoiding damp in pots and keeping costs very low.","Hello! I searched and skimmed  results before asking this.

I want to do some real apartment gardening as well as grow some plants and flowers for the comfort and prettiness.

We don't have a balcony, window planters are not legal. We do live in a big old building with very thick walls, hence, deep window shelves.

Money is super tight. I'm not doing hydroponics, getting tents. I don't even want to spend much on potting materials.

I started collecting materials to compost myself, obsessively, a few years ago, then never actually used them properly. But it made the think about using two off the main items I saved in other ways.

Coffee grounds and eggshells.

Instead of coco core (sp?) and perlite and such, if I want to maintain a somewhat airy, not sodden/dense matrix when potting, to allow drainage inside a pot that I might not be able to have full drainage holes in, can we do things like mix in dried (definitely dried) coffee grounds and cleaned, dried eggshells that have been crushed, but not powdered?

Rather than obsess about nutrients, like calcium, as I used to think of for eggshells, instead of fighting the fact that they don‚Äôt break down quickly or well, maybe just crush them up to a millimeter or so in size and use them as lightweight mass, mixed with grounds, and potting soil, especially lower down in the pot where drainage is important? I figure if they do leach calcium out slowly, fine, great. 

I'm probably over thinking it, but that's okay, it's part of the fun. So, when I'm ready to place like tomato seedlings, I was thinking of putting a layer like this starting about 3 or 4 inches down in an eight inch pot.

Also, I don't have any stone or gravel. Should I be layering something like that in the bottom of most of my pots or is just plain soil, from a bag, going to drain well enough if I don't over water?

Thanks.",1,1748492671.0,vegetablegardening,2,0.67,False
1ky1ssf,https://www.reddit.com/r/habitDecoded/comments/1ky1ssf/its_strange_how_a_simple_morning_ritual_can_keep/,It's strange how a simple morning ritual can keep me in check,"Lately, I've noticed how important my morning coffee ritual is to my day. I'm not really a morning person, but having that first cup of coffee really grounds my whole day. It's not just about the caffeine though, which, let's be honest, is needed. It's more about the routine of it.

I wake up, feed my cat who insists it's breakfast time way too early, and then I head to the kitchen. Grinding beans, heating water, and the aroma filling the room... it's oddly comforting. It's like a signal to my brain that I can start the day. I read somewhere that habits are deeply connected to reward pathways in our brains, which I guess makes sense. The coffee and quiet time are my reward.

When I skip this routine, I'm kinda all over the place. My day feels more chaotic, and I end up compensating with random distractions. I think having this structure helps me limit decision fatigue right off the bat. It sets the tone, you know? I wonder if other people feel this way about their morning routines too. ü§î Maybe it's that consistency they talk about when it comes to habits. Anyway, I've learned to respect this little ritual of mine more than ever. It's the anchor I didn't know I needed.",7,1748492651.0,habitDecoded,0,1.0,False

1ky1s4f,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1ky1s4f/introducing_the_phasic_metabolic_reset_pmr/,Introducing the Phasic Metabolic Reset (PMR) Protocol,"Abstract: Phasic Metabolic Reset (PMR) is a structured, phased intermittent fasting protocol engineered to modulate metabolic pathways, promote lipid oxidation, and optimize systemic homeostasis over a 97-day cycle. The protocol alternates controlled fasting periods with scheduled refeeding windows of equivalent duration in a progressive format, designed to increase physiological resilience while avoiding metabolic habituation.

Objective: To improve metabolic health outcomes via a non-pharmacological intervention that cycles extended fasting durations with nutrient-controlled refeeding. The protocol aims to activate autophagy, enhance insulin sensitivity, reduce adiposity, regulate endocrine responses, and support anti-inflammatory processes.

Protocol Design:

- Day 1: 1-day Fast
- Day 2: 1-day Refeed
- Days 3-4: 2-day Fast
- Days 5-6: 2-day Refeed
- Days 7-9: 3-day Fast
- Days 10-12: 3-day Refeed
- Days 13-16: 4-day Fast
- Days 17-20: 4-day Refeed
- Days 21-25: 5-day Fast
- Days 26-30: 5-day Refeed
- Days 31-36: 6-day Fast
- Days 37-42: 6-day Refeed
- Days 43-49: 7-day Fast
- Days 50-56: 7-day Refeed
- Days 57-62: 6-day Fast
- Days 63-68: 6-day Refeed
- Days 69-73: 5-day Fast
- Days 74-78: 5-day Refeed
- Days 79-82: 4-day Fast
- Days 83-86: 4-day Refeed
- Days 87-89: 3-day Fast
- Days 90-92: 3-day Refeed
- Days 93-94: 2-day Fast
- Days 95-96: 2-day Refeed
- Day 97: 1-day Fast

Fasting Phase Specifications:

- No caloric intake permitted
- Unrestricted water consumption encouraged
- Sodium, potassium, and magnesium supplementation recommended
- Optional: black coffee or unsweetened tea (non-caloric)

Refeeding Phase Specifications:

Refeeding phases are intended to restore anabolic signaling, replenish micronutrients, and maintain lean mass.

- Refeeding Syndrome Mitigation: Following any fast exceeding 72 hours, begin with low-volume, low-fiber, high-bioavailability foods such as bone broth, eggs, and soft-cooked meats
- Macronutrient Composition: Emphasis on high protein (1.5‚Äì2.0 g/kg lean mass), moderate fat, and minimal carbohydrates
-bFood Selection: Focus on minimally processed, nutrient-dense, animal-based foods: meat, fish, eggs, organ meats
- Exclusion Criteria: Avoid sugar, seed oils, grains, legumes, and processed food products
- Meal Frequency: One to two discrete meals per day with full digestion intervals
- Hydration Continuity: Maintain electrolyte supplementation as during fasts
- Caloric Intake: Ad libitum within satiety thresholds. Avoid post-fasting hyperphagia

Mechanistic Rationale:

- Autophagic Induction: Extended fasting enhances lysosomal degradation of senescent cellular material
- Glucose Homeostasis: Improved insulin receptor sensitivity and glucose disposal
- Lipolytic Activity: Increased mobilization of adipose stores for energy
- Endocrine Regulation: Normalization of leptin, ghrelin, and testosterone in metabolic syndrome populations
- Inflammatory Profile: Downregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
- Mitochondrial Efficiency: Enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis and metabolic flexibility
- Avoidance of Metabolic Habituation: The phased escalation and tapering of fasts in PMR disrupts caloric predictability, preserving hormonal sensitivity and sustaining adaptive metabolic responses.

Adjunctive Recommendations:

- Daily low-intensity physical activity: walking, stretching, or mobility drills
- Prioritize circadian-aligned sleep patterns
- Track metabolic markers: bodyweight, circumference, glucose, ketones (optional)

Contraindications:

- Pregnancy, lactation, eating disorders, underweight BMI (<15%)
- Chronic conditions requiring continuous caloric intake unless supervised by a healthcare professional
- Individuals on glucose-lowering or antihypertensive medication should consult with a clinician

Conclusion: PMR is a time-bound intervention for individuals seeking structured metabolic recalibration. By alternating catabolic and anabolic phases over increasing durations, it provides a safe, scalable approach for optimizing body composition, metabolic biomarkers, and cellular resilience. 

This protocol is not a lifestyle diet but a metabolic reset intervention.",2,1748492585.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False
