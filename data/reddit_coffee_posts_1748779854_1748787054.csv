I got cheated on last summer. She was on a vacation at a club. Since then, whenever a girl mentions she goes out and drinks, I have to cut off contact. 

I feel like this is limiting my dating pool by a large margain. Is it unrealistic to search for girls who dont part take in clubbing, or should I just risk it and go for them, even though lying in bed while they are out would make my stomach turn from paranoia?

I myself dont club, I work 2 jobs to pay for Uni, I eould really like someone who just likes going out for coffee or staying in. Are these realistic standards for my age? Do nerdy girls exist and how hard are they to find?

1l0pkv0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0pkv0,Pretty Great Old Laptop Bag. Willing to Part.,"Hey everyone, 


I worked at an Oakley Vault for 4 years during college during the 2010’s. These were the best days of the company. Huge discounts. Tons of freebies. A culture of fun. I still wear a bunch of cool old winter jackets that I’ll post sometime. I also have some cool old school googles. 

That culture got ripped away during the acquisition. I remember when my paycheck stopped coming from foothill ranch and came from ADP. I miss the old days. I digress. 

I just found this in my closet all wrapped up. I’m interested in the value and if anyone would be interested in procuring it. It’s from the standard issue line but also has a code red tag. I think this is pretty rare in our circle of people who value this stuff. Would be an awesome commuting bag. 

The table in the photos is an original 2000’s era changing room table too. Not for sale. It’s my coffee table. 

Even if no takers, I hope you enjoy! 


This item came to the outlets. Meaning I got it late. Likely circa 2000’s not 2010’s in manufacturing.

1l0pjtt,https://i.redd.it/90f30i92nb4f1.jpeg,Where to now …..  long post …,"What is abundantly clear to me is that Petrone’s do not like travel . They like to be away from home and work . Basically they like being on vacation like the rest of us .

They have no interest in history , other cultures or Art . They like eating out , resorts , shopping , and the beach. 

For them to spin that they loved to travel and experience all the different cities etc is a bunch of BS.  Sure they were in some beautiful spots , but they would have been content to spend a month in Antibes or the resort . 

 With all that said , it’s ok to not like to sightsee , not spend every day doing “ something”  while on vacation .  But then why in the heck did you drag your family around for two weeks ? Paris and London were painful to watch.  The other locations were smaller , but they really were not happy any place without a beach or pool.  And that is OK … just admit it . Don’t spin the “look at us the traveling , adventure family” . They are not . 

She spent massive money she didn’t need to , but now she knows .  The value in the vacation was forced time together . 

We learned they are not curious in any way of other cultures or history . Very uneducated in basic things , hospitality for one . Their kids have no table manners , but probably do now . They are pretty much a chicken nugget family , and are clearly not foodies . ( After a month in Europe she called burrata , mozzarella ) . 

I think we all can agree it was crazy to take a vacation like they did , and basically just walk around and eat pizza and pastries . Was there anything inspiring , to me ? No . , Would  I have loved at 39 to take a month off of work with my family and go on vacation somewhere ? Sure … would it be hauling duffle bags around Europe .. no . 

She is back to losing followers , you would think she would learn that no one is here for Dino . She also posted and then removed all of her soft porn hot springs stuff , after her early morning rant about everyone being jealous of her .. and it’s been down hill since then .  

So, going forward . I hope they improve the guest experience at the Inn . What idiots even mentioning washer and dryers when the Inn doesn’t have any ! Gushing over well stocked kitchen and rental when that is their business ! Posting about duvets as if it only exists in 5 star resorts in Italy ! The ignorance is extreme . 

I also hope they treat their kids differently. Maybe get atleast F in a real preschool and hopefully Q into a regular school . Not lock themselves in their bedroom every night . Maybe make meals , set a table and stop with Petrone Prison . 

As far as TN who knows  .  But my best guess is nothing will really change . We will be back to Ashley and Dino running off for weekends .. F learning a new dance ,  pictures of coffee , Dino shirtless , Ashley looking a wreck in ill fitting hats . 

My last comment on the European trip which really wasn’t a European trip , is I am so tired of her speaking poorly of the US .  She can have all the organic and “ clean” food she desires right where she lives . She can walk to a gorgeous beach , and tube and boat daily if she wanted to . She has an Inn which she can be a friendly host and provide an incredible experience . She has a shop and coffee shop she can create a sense of community . 

Everything she loved about “ Europe” she literally has at her finger tips , and has never shown an interest in it.  As I have said before her life in Florida reads like a Hallmark movie , minus the leading man 🤪.  Whether 
she realizes that now or not .. is yet to be seen .  

I think we will be back to regularly scheduled programming .

1l0pjno,https://www.reddit.com/r/WorkAdvice/comments/1l0pjno/to_quit_or_not/,To quit or not,"
I’ve now worked at a government job for 1 year(meaning my probationary period is complete now and I have options of transferring to a different facility). This job has sucked the life and soul out of me. I used to be a fairly optimistic person and looked past a lot of the initial flaws I saw with management such as forgetting to pick me up from my orientation on my first day or failing to set up the prerequisites I needed for my training. There is a lack of professionalism from management I turned a blind eye to (such as I heard the manager talking poorly about a new employees weight and the accommodations she would need for her workspace because of her weight which is a disability) but despite the initial red flags I pushed through and was placed in my workspace which is far away from where my management is located. My workspace is a clinic where there is a very obvious hierarchy which I was content with being on the lower end of the totem pole. I set myself up with the mentality of clock in clock out, leave work and go home and do this for a paycheck. I commute an hour each way everyday as well. I was content the first couple of months until I noticed my coworker who has the same role as I do did not like me. I don’t intend on being friends with my coworkers, but if a friendship occurs and happens naturally it’s always nice to have. But later within the year it crossed a threshold of dislike to hatred. It started with small rude comments like her calling me “weird” or “strange”to my face. Then copying as she got a hairstyle similar to myself and other coworkers noticed and even called her out on it. I have a family member who works at the same facility as myself and has worked closely with some of my coworkers in the past. He came to visit me during my lunch and introduced himself to everyone in my clinic. Then next week on a day she had taken off she brings her family member (who does not work here) around and introduces her to the clinic. Then she always asks everyone in our clinic if they want to grab lunch except myself. She’ll DoorDash food for everyone but never once has asked me to join in. She also does this with coffee and I am always the only person she does not ask. Then it got bigger by attempting to sabotage my work telling people to go to her for advice because I didn’t know what I was doing, or blaming me for mistakes that she makes herself. My other coworker overheard her gossiping about me in another language with another coworker as well. On top of my issues with this coworker I am currently going through a major health issue (the big C)that requires me to receive chemotherapy every other week. I only now qualify for FMLA as I just hit my one year , but I have used up all my leave and have had to take leave without pay because there is nothing else at this job to protect individuals who have severe health problems who have not hit their one year. This job has caused me to become someone I do not like. I am anxious everyday regardless if I am working or not because of my health and the toll this job puts on me. I feel unappreciated and hated. I work so hard and it all goes unnoticed because of the sabotage of my one coworker. People talk about my attendance because I was not protected under FMLA and needed to be absent because of my chemotherapy treatment. I have never been this depressed or low in life and while there are outside things contributing, I think majority comes from this job. People are rude and dismissive of myself and I have never been treated this way in my other jobs. I am now starting to bring my stress home and it’s taken out unintentionally on my husband. I’m losing my hair because of the stress I am under (my chemotherapy does not affect hair loss in any way). I’ve thought about applying for other jobs but I have no energy even on my days off to search for a new job because of how drained I am. I feel trapped. I want to escape and quit and recollect myself and fully process what’s happened this past year, but I need a job that offers health insurance because of my condition. My husband’s insurance is not as good as mine and while we could survive off of his paycheck, it would cause a significant lifestyle change. I am also nervous to apply for jobs and be stuck in a similar or even worse environment and lose the benefits I have at this job. There are so many cons that outweigh the pros at this point. The only pros I have are I adore and love helping the patients at the clinic and the financial benefits of working in government long term. Any advice?

First date was a simple coffee date and I could assess from that date that he was very shy and kind of awkward. I am also the same way, so it wasn’t a big deal. There wasn’t really any flirting and it felt like a platonic conversation but he was quite pleasant to talk to, so I wanted to see him again.

He asked me out on a second date and took me to dinner and well, I’m unsure on how it went. I went a bit above and beyond to dress up and he didn’t compliment me at all. I got a compliment from our waitress which was nice but he didn’t give me a look and he didn’t tell me I looked nice, so I felt like he wasn’t attracted to me? 

We did have a pleasant dinner and I liked talking to him, but again there was no flirting or anything like that. He suggested we take a walk around the area after we were done eating and we did. At a point we were done walking and he asked me if I wanted to meet his dog which I was more than happy to do so, so we went to his place.

When I was there, I met his dog and he showed me around his house but again there was no making a move or anything like that. Things got awkward towards the end because I guess we were like “well what else is there to do” and he asked me if I was ready to head out and I was like sure, I guess it is time and I just thanked him for showing me around. 

At the end of the date, there was still no kiss but we hugged.

 
He texted me if I got home safe to which I replied I did and I thanked him for a great time, and then I just asked him if he felt like he saw me in more of a platonic way.

He replied that he’s nervous about overstepping boundaries, so yes he does see it as platonic, but he said we both are more introverted so he didn’t get any hints from me.

So does that mean he’s not attracted to me?

It reminded me of something I had long carried in silence: the feeling of an inner collapse, a loss of meaning so profound that it seemed almost impossible to speak of. Franny’s experience—her breakdown, her disillusionment, and her longing for something real—mirrored my own in a way that felt both unsettling and strangely comforting.
Salinger’s Franny reads like a quietly existential novel, centered on a question I’ve often thought about: what do we do when meaning quietly disappears from our lives?
Franny grows tired of all humanistic values and begins to distrust language itself, along with the very act of expression. This weariness comes from a deeply existential experience-what Kierkegaard once called “dizziness”: a kind of spiritual panic that arises when one falls out of the illusions that once held their world together.
“I’m sick of not having the courage to be an absolute nobody. I’m sick of myself and everybody else that wants to make some kind of a splash.” At one point, Franny breaks down and says something I haven’t forgotten: It wasn’t just anger. It was exhaustion---of being someone, of striving, of caring what others think.
In her breakdown, Franny says she’s tired of “myself and everybody else that wants to make some kind of a splash.” It’s more than frustration. It’s the existential nausea that comes from recognizing how even our deepest ambitions are tangled up in ego, performance, and fear of being no one.
She grows tired of the very mechanism that gives shape to the self—the endless striving to be someone, to become “special.” She no longer trusts the version of herself that wants to stand out, nor does she find any real appeal in the idea of being exceptional. In a sense, “special” no longer exists for her.
This is the early stage of what existentialists might call the awakening to authentic existence: the painful moment when you realize that who you are has been constructed by society and culture—not chosen by you. And from that realization comes rejection, even disgust, toward the self.
This is where the crisis begins—not in the loss of meaning, but in realizing that the meaning you’ve lived with was never truly yours.
Compared to Franny, Lane represents the kind of person who feels comfortable within the established system. He lives easily, effortlessly navigating institutional norms. He knows how to discuss literature in socially accepted ways, how to align with intellectual authorities, and how to affirm his identity through a stable structure of meaning.
For Franny, however, that very system has become toxic. What Lane experiences as nourishment, she experiences as poison. She has lost her trust in original structures of meaning, and thus no longer wishes to talk about literature—not because she devalues it entirely, but because she senses that language itself has become a barrier rather than a bridge. It no longer reveals truth but conceals it.
Yet at the same time, she cannot find any transcendent replacement for the broken secular systems. In this vacuum, the incessant prayer described in that Russian novel becomes a kind of experiment: a way of bypassing language altogether, seeking instead a return to a pure, unmediated state of being.
When language approaches its limit, one begins to long for an experience beyond words—an indescribable state that brings us face to face with being itself.
After experiencing this inner upheaval, Franny is still unsure whether she can find a new foundation to rely on. She finds herself in a dilemma: how can she be herself in a world where God is no longer a definitive presence? She longs to awaken, but the weight of awakening threatens to crush her. Madness or prayer—Salinger leaves the choice to Franny and readers.
Franny reminds me of the narrator in Dostoevsky’s Notes from Underground. They both stand at the fissure of truth. Before them lies the abyss of fractured truth; behind them, the emptiness of a meaningless world. It is a dilemma that, in one form or another, each of us must face—only through it can we begin to answer the riddle of meaning.
I read this novel on my birthday. It reminded me of my own experience—of going through a similar kind of inner upheaval.
For me, the idea of a meaningless world was once unbearable. Since childhood, my parents, driven by their own anxieties, taught me that every action must have a purpose, that every effort must lead to a result, or else it was a type of failure. But later, when everything I thought I had—my abilities, my worth—was denied, I suddenly felt disoriented, as if I had lost my place in the world.
After enduring countless grey days and nights, I began to understand the pain that nearly crushed Franny—the pain that cannot be easily spoken of. I don’t know what choice Franny would make. For a time, I longed to end it all. I dug for meaning wherever I could—through books, through movies, through people, through every path I could reach—but I failed again.
Gradually, I chose to stand back up. I read Lacan, Camus, Heidegger, and Sartre. I watched films and wrote journals. Slowly, I began to accept that the world itself is meaningless—and that’s precisely why I need to face my life and to take good care of myself. I now want to live again, and perhaps find the last roses blooming in my ruined garden. (Like the lyric said, “Hello my loneliness, so we met again, you haven’t changed a bit”, I love this song, btw, hehe.)
That acceptance has come with a price: a kind of indescribable loneliness. But I’ve come to realize that such loneliness is inevitable. Radical freedom comes with radical solitude. I’m still learning how to live alongside it.
I remember watching Evangelion during those dark times. Shinji rejects the Human Instrumentality Project and chooses instead to carry the burden of being human—that we can never fully understand one another, yet still choose to reach out. The pain, the confusion, the struggle—all of it proves we are human, not gods. And that, precisely, is what makes our efforts meaningful.
And, I’ve imagined how the existentialists might have rewritten Franny’s story. Camus, perhaps, would have her order an apple pie—just to enjoy the momentary sweetness of life. Sartre might let her walk away from the relationship, or simply choose to stay and drink her coffee—because either would be an act of freedom.
This passage is a birthday gift to myself. I chose to write it in English, not in my native tongue. It took me a long time, because I still couldn’t express my thoughts clearly in English. But I wanted to express these thoughts beyond the safety of familiarity.
I hope I can continue living in this world, where people are growing ever more distant from one another—with my loneliness, with my effort, and with a quiet depth. It reminds me of a saying that Vinent van Gogh said, “I want to touch people with my art. I want them to say: he feels deeply, he feels tenderly”. Not for some grand purpose, but maybe just because the weather is nice today. And maybe that’s enough reason to live well.

**Why This Pick?**

The Blue Jays have been hitting the ball way too well for me to think this total stays Under 8. And despite their struggles in the first game of this series, the As put 7 runs on the board yesterday (not that I think they’ll get a whole 7 runs past Kevin Gausman…). In addition, JP Sears’ (5.18 ERA) last 4 straight outings have seen the Over cash in spades. Sears allowed a staggering 10 hits and 9 runs in his last outing against the Astros, and 8 hits with 6 earned runs against the Angels back on May 21st. The pitching advantage here is so vast, it’s wildly unlikely that Sears keeps the Jays in check. While I think the Athletics will contribute a few runs, it’s far more plausible that Toronto runs up a steep total. I’m on the Over to hit, friends.

- Now don’t ask me whether Crony Capitalist Argentina is more evil than Socialist Cuba with a high life expectancy. 


- neither Dr. Raghu Ram Rajan can answer that nor me. 


- The left blames capitalism for things being too expensive, while the right thinks lack of capitalism is what’s keeping them from being billionaires. 


- Leftist blame capitalism for not being able to afford health care while working at a tiny coffee shop. Right winger blames lack of capitalism, for government taking so much money through taxes that they can’t afford to buy coffee at a tiny coffee shops. Neither perspective actually cares about what capitalism means.

- When either is discussed, most of the time the crux of the argument is not about economics, but authoritarianism. Both capitalism and socialism can be government with varied and equally brutal forms of authoritarianism, with extremes of Plutocracy versus Communism. Trump questioning loyalty of international travelers, is under the same economic structure where Biden included trans rights as part of his inauguration. 

- The same economic policy bombed the shit out of Iraq, also accepted millions of refugees of every creed and color.

Trump would be a bad president running a socialist country or a capitalist country. That is not the actual issue, where I’d say clutching to capitalism is just as much a facade for Trump’s authoritarian protection if his greed, as his humping the flag or holding a Bible upside down. 


- Its iconography meant to invoke visions of freedom, to protect politician’s ego and incompetence. People who hate capitalism are attacking the shield people like Trump use to get away will ill gotten gains, not the actual corruption that would equally exist under socialism.

- Politics would be much more accessible and civil, if people simply saw every economic issue as a set of screws. With capitalism being a flat head screwdriver, while socialism is philips head screwdriver. 


- You simply need to figure out which problem needs the correct screwdriver. As long as the populace can keep authoritarians from forcing us to use screwdrivers based on ideology or ego, instead of need, the populace should be fine.",1,1748785581.0,india,1,1.0,False

1l0pbru,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1l0pbru/abused_stressed_starting_the_divorce_process/,"Abused, stressed, starting the divorce process. Looking to reflect, show me the mirror","19 years into the marriage and I have reached a stage where I just can't bear anymore. It breaks my heart thinking about our toddler daughter who has to go through the fallout. This reason alone has persuaded me so far from taking the step.

I am 41M, married to my wife who is 45F. We are Indian nationals, moved to the US few years ago for my work. I am an executive in a large global org and earn accordingly. To an outsider, I am not a loser, in fact the far fetched other end.



The honeymoon period:

Although I wasn't in love heels over head, we decided to get married fairly soon after we met. We both come from a background where courtship almost means commitment, so this shouldn't be a surprise. Before our marriage, she decided to stop working and I let her, supporting her in any way I could. She completely devoted herself to the 2 people that is us. She was empathetic in sharing every moment of professional success I had in the job and I shared everything with her. We had a very lively marriage, she took care of the inside household ( with maid's help ) and I did everything external, administrative things and the job. 

On the other hand, my wife tried to control almost everything from our relationships to what I do. She isolated us into a box, away from everyone else, both families, friends, relatives. I didn't even hang out at office parties, or got out early, because those were not the things I was supposed to enjoy alone. Especially my family, whom I rarely met and engaged with even over phone. Any remote attempts would get her upset and crying, which I almost always relented to. She didn't seem to have second thoughts distancing herself from her friends either. And her behavior with almost everyone seemed not nice, if not blatantly rude. I wasn’t allowed to read books while I have always been a reader, not spending time on hobbies ( I like sketching) or following sports. I adjusted; to keep her happy and thinking this is a compromise I need to make to give us more time for each other. This was a big deal for me since I have always needed time and space and most had none.

  
More Testing times:

I am sure there were many nuances to it, but as I grew in my career, I got closer to the political and other aspects of the job and obviously I shared everything with her. Not sharing meant almost shutting her off, while 2 of us was the whole thing going on for her, and also considering that she was so focused on the success through my advancement. However, this led to her criticizing me on everything - an email I wrote, something I said in the office, a decision I made. Comparing salary or the position or the amount of efforts without knowing any facts. She made baseless assumptions and imagining how different people we knew are somehow associated in the background using the information I share against me; controlling my social behaviour. I also was held responsible for my family’s activities; a social post or a status made me the target of her anger towards them, while I was not even engaged with them, or considered those any way relevant to us. She made direct remarks on my ability, personality, calling me gullible to everyone around.

On the other hand, I started to sense some female attention towards me. I had nothing to do with it, though, and never tried to understand or read anything into it.

Over the years, I kept advancing professionally in all aspects, quite fast in hindsight. But obviously not without challenges. Her frustration and reactions grew every day, it seemed like she couldn’t picture the whole progress and instead was obsessed with daily challenges and setbacks and considered me and my shortcomings as the reason.
We talked about it, I argued, and most of the time she eventually calmed down. But to me, this was a huge strain and completely unnecessary for to handle. I also proposed counselling one time, but she didn’t want to do it, and didn’t trust it.

By this time, the female attention had become more explicit towards me. I kept on ignoring, never even responding until I did, to one of them who had a crush on me. Initially, it was friendly, and I made it clear for months that I cannot take it any further. But eventually it led to me making the big mistake of having an affair. It was short-lived, as my wife found out in a couple of months. I was overwhelmed with guilt and told her this would never happen again. 
At the same time, I opened up more about my feelings and frustrations in the past years. And I told her I would be okay if she decided to separate because of this, since I have had that thought many times. She decided otherwise, and seemed to take this into stride, and after this, unexpectedly, we got to know we are also expecting! Something we had been trying for years unsuccessfully. 

Leading to current:
Soon after we moved to the US. With our pregnancy and no help, I took on most of the house chores, cooking, along with everything else I used to do before - external work, administrative work, finances , and of course the job. 
After our daughter was born, I also took care for her, changing, feeding, and night time care. 
Now she does look after our daughter, especially when I m at work. I feel this responsibility has thrown her into a completely different level of anger issues. Even a couple of hours of me being busy escalates to her starting to throw stuff, mess up the house. Throwing my coffee or laptop or shutting off the power in the office, or anything I am doing at work. The list of unimaginable things she does throughout the day can be a huge post in itself. All of this goes along with constant cursing, verbal abuse, sometimes escalating to physical abuse.
I don’t respond and have gone into stonewalling mode most of the time to avoid escalation, but escalations happen all the time anyway. 
I don’t mind doing all the work and have no expectations from her on that part. But the work I do, or don’t do becomes a target of the abuse. The stress this all creates on me, while also managing a very demanding, political and challenging position has put unbearable distress on me.
But it doesn’t stop there. What she is also hurting is my relationship with my daughter. While I am expected to take care of her as soon as I have a breather, I have no autonomy of deciding what I feed her, or when I can talk to her, or when I can play with her or make her laugh. Many times, I just freeze not knowing what to do, and that throws her off too. I am held responsible for everything from her not drinking water on time, eating properly or taking a light fall or making her sick every time she falls ill ( while I am trying to cope up myself ). I constantly keep thinking of how this all is affecting our daughter, including my submissive behaviour. 

To come to closure of this very long post - the reason I decided to give the whole story was to try and be unbiased and also to express what I believe trying to reason her behaviour: that, it’s not only the result of the mistake I made, rather her nature that is to distrust everyone not only me, think of the past and problems all the time, cynicism and asocial view and the pressure of responsibility of raising a kid which every parent goes through. And also to convey that the mistake I made isn’t my nature rather a genuine one, I can’t roll back. And in my view, I should not be subjected to lifelong harassment and abuse for. 

Please share if you think otherwise. Does anyone see a different way to take it forward? 
I am completely checked out of making any attempts to make this marriage work. In fact I feel I will be doing injustice to myself by doing so.
Throughout my life, I have come to appreciate having the freedom to make decisions. However, have not had the courage to take actions that lead me towards that freedom. Not getting out of this now, I consider will be a failure that will haunt me for life.

A follow-up from a surprisingly valuable personalfinance discussion.,"Yesterday, I posted on /r/personalfinance with some basic numbers and a request for thoughts regarding buying a property fully in cash. Got some good perspective, shit-talked a few internet trolls, a good time was had by all. 

Honestly, I fully expected to be shot down, to be spammed with ""tImE iN ThE mARkEt..."" mantras, or at least to be ridiculed for having such a large cash position.

Instead, I was surprised to see about 90% of the comments *recommending* the purchase, given all other financial ducks were in a row. One such comment recommended posting *here*, so here we are for a slightly more in-depth and detailed discussion.

But since I'm putting *you* lovely people in a category slightly above the non-FI-minded folks, here's a slightly more robust post.

Before we start: I am *not* asking for financial advice, just for perspective, thoughts, and experiences. And I greatly appreciate anyone taking time to read and share some of their own!

-----

**Background:**

42, single, no children/never married, and not terribly interested in changing either of those situations.

NW: 988k

Investments: maxed 401k, Roth IRA, and HSA in either sp500 index or target date fund, rest into a taxable brokerage account in sp500. I buy and hold and refuse to duck in and out trying to time anything, especially given the current irrational volatility, and plan to continue this simple approach until retirement, where I'll likely shift a bit of that out of equities. But we're not here to talk investments...

Salary: 100k-120k, one more promotion bump a few years ahead if I want it. I'm a tenured academic, which is as stable as jobs get in my field, and have several part time jobs outside of that. 

Cash: 465k *""wHy So mUCh cAsH?!?""* Long story, don't worry about it. Again, not asking for financial advice. Just presenting numbers.

Emergency fund: A generous year + of expenses in a HYSA, also conservatively planning to put aside 5-6% of purchase price for initial expenses.

Current situation: I rent a cute little townhouse for 950/month. My life costs about 18k/year currently (that includes rent). According to every calculator and FI rule I've come across, *technically* I'm already at my number (450k-500k) but obviously don't plan on just ""getting by"" with that. I do plan to continue working for *at least* the next decade - less for the salary, more for the insurance, and mostly for the sense of external purpose because as lovely as sitting around at home cooking, gardening, and watching movies sounds, that gets depressing *real* fast...

-----

And now, the psychological/philosophical nonsense you came for:

I grew up poor-ish. Like we were never (to my knowledge) a paycheck away from being evicted, but we never had ""nice things"". Money was always a ""big scary thing"" at home, and frugality, saving, and the value of security were instilled in my from, basically, infancy. Which I'm grateful for in retrospect, and I'm sure has been a major factor in getting me where I am today. 

But old habits die hard, and ideals implanted in important developmental years are a *bitch* to erase, even decades later when you know better. 

There's a part of me that will always want *more*. More security in case the zombies come. More cash on hand in case of x or y. More income-earning years ""just in case"". Intellectually, I know I have more than enough, I fully understand the principles, I can run the simulator until I'm blue in the face and always come out ok. Emotionally... I know I never will.

Turning 40 was a valuable reflection time for me. Looking back on the past, looking ahead to the future. Taking stock of position, trajectory, momentum. Finances were a big part of that, as it's been a central focus of my last two decades.

And I kept coming back to the question: ""what was/is it all *for*?"" I've read/heard all of Mr. Buffet's shareholder addresses and interviews urging young people to ""live"" and not obsess over money. I've listened to (most of) the podcasts talking about ""enough"" and stories from all of the early retirees who urge their younger selves to enjoy the journey more. I've heard Ramit yell at me for avoiding the $4 coffee for years. I understand (psychologically/reasonably) that money is a *tool* meant to provide for a *life experience*. 

The only destination I could see, continuing my current path, would be dying a miserable old miser with more millions than I could ever do anything with and deeply regretting sacrificing everything for the privilege. And for the first time in my life, I realized I *really didn't want that*.

So I've been slowly, gingerly easing off the acceleration pedal. No drastic changes, no sudden new lifestyle inflation, just letting myself breathe a bit more and enjoy the work I've done and sacrifices I've made to get here, before the opportunity passes me by and I become one of those ""nUmBEr mUsT gO Up"" morons.

-----

**Back to the present**:

I'm seriously considering buying my first house. I've moved around for work most of my life, mostly in HCOL cities where renting was the only feasible option, particularly with a 4-5 year transplantation timeline. I'm (mostly...) happy where I am, a relatively LCOL city in a pretty area. It's quiet, safe, cute, and comfortable. I'm as stable here as I will literally ever be anywhere, and have decided I'd like to stay and settle.

I'm looking at properties in the 300k-400k range, which gets you a cute 1800-ish sqf house on about half an acre of land here. Meeting with a realtor next week to discuss further and start the process.

Numbers-wise, I can buy everything I'm looking at in cash, not touch my e-fund, have more than enough left for first year maintenance/furniture/decoration, not touch a single investment, and continue to earn my salary and invest exactly as I currently am. Basic napkin math says cash is a no brainer.

Psychologically... it's not so easy to swallow. After all, what was the point of saving and sacrificing for *decades* if you're going to just blow it all in a 5 minute closing meeting?

**Considerations:**

1) Suck it up, buy in cash.

With a 780+ credit score and excellent financial situation, I'm confident I could get a 6% API on a mortgage. Assuming an average market return of 7-8%... every fibre of my being would rather take the safe, guaranteed 6% than ""hope"" for average/above average returns. I fully trust, over 30 years, the market will outperform that... but current volatility and irrationality are not inspiring much confidence.

- Pros: immediate peace of mind, zero interest out of my pocket, a ""clean slate"" to continue building wealth from without a constant shadow lurking on the horizon.
- Cons: holy *fuck* that's a lot of money, cue long list of ""what if""s, making all of the right/conservative financial decisions for 42 years only to be stupid with the biggest purchase I'll ever make

2) Split the difference

Put 50% down on a 15-year, invest the difference. This seems psychologically/emotionally safe, in case *one* of those decisions turns out to be a poor one over the next decade or so, the other would, by nature, pull the average up.

- Pros: A psychological safety net against depleting 4/5 of my cash reserves in an instant
- Cons: Doesn't really ""win"" either way numbers wise, just hedging bets against a disaster on either side

3) Be normal, trust the market

20% down, 30-year, suck up the monthly responsibility, continue to invest over the timeframe knowing that, in the end, my ""number"" will be bigger.

-Pros: Could always pay off the balance whenever I wanted to. 
-Cons: I just... know I wouldn't, had I decided to take out a loan in the first place.  It would always be ""well *what if* next year?"" and ""ok, *one more year* playing it safe, *then* I'll pay it off"". 

What I cannot wrap my head around is that, in this scenario I would pay *more than 90% of the value of the house solely in interest payments, without touching principle or equity"". My dumb math brain does not fully understand that. That would, literally, be like buying *two* houses just for the privilege of the bank letting me buy *one* house. And I'm a cheap bastard, so that prospect sounds *absolutely unacceptable*. Please make it make sense?? That figure *alone* makes me want to dive headfirst into fully cash and not throw a penny away at interest, ever.

-----

**Conclusion:**

Again, not asking for financial advice. Just giving my current numbers, situation, and a bit of my psychology (which I'm trusting is familiar and welcome here) to ask for thoughts/impressions/experiences of like minds. I welcome both ""you're being a moron, this is literally what cash is for, you've wasted more time considering this than your time is worth"" as well as ""you're being a moron, you're not considering x, y, and z massive risks, mortgages exist for a reason, don't waste everything you've worked so hard for"".

Am I being stupid for *not* dropping the cash I safely and conservatively have on hand for immediate peace of mind, permanent ownership of a residence I plan to stay in forever, and avoiding needlessly wasting another dollar on rent/interest payments?

Or am I being stupid for listening to the /r/personalfinance crowd (who may or may not understand FIRE mentality and lifestyle) who overwhelmingly support the idea?

Ultimately, I want to make *both* the sound financial decision that's not wasting opportunity or being frivolous with money after being ultra-focused with it for decades, while *also* balancing the right psychological decision regarding peace of mind, not being a miserly servant to the almighty ""number"" for no practical reason, and ultimately using what I have to buy the most peace, security, and happiness.

1l0p8ph,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1l0p8ph/monthly_update/,Monthly Update,"Hope this is fine to post here - thought it would be cool to share in the community for accountability and insights. 

Started my journey roughly 2 weeks ago, so no major updates so far. Posting anyway to help build the habit and reflect monthly on my progress. My goals were the following: 

  
**Incorporate more whole foods**

This has largely been a success. In the past weeks, I have been cooking a LOT more at home and consumed more veggies. With a rough plan in mind, I don't feel the need to even buy so much food in from outside which is also one of the biggest plus. 

I selected a bunch of recipes from a food blogger called Vegan Richa since she is very praised in the vegan and whole food subs. Unfortunately, none of the recipes worked out for me. I guess she's just not for me but since I bought groceries around these recipes, I still cooked all of them and adapted where possible to make it work. The last days I picked up a cookbook that a friend gifted me long ago from Joe Wicks who I have been ignoring for way too long because his recipes actually turned out really well! He's neither vegan nor whole food plant based but with a few minor adaptations, I feel his recipes can hit both categories. So, I've been sticking and exploring with that for now. 

**Eat smarter while travelling** 

The true test will come tomorrow since I have not been away. I will make some kimchi pancakes for dinner and take some of them on the train with me tomorrow. I also aim to take some coffee so that I don't have to buy any (although my flask is too big to be practical... We'll see about this). I probably cannot pass to order food from my favourite Chinese place I discovered last time (we have no good ones in my town) but I think this is still a great start! 

**Exercise regularly**

YES! So happy I managed to stay accountable within these 2 weeks.  I exercised 4-5 times a week either running or doing home workouts. I still feel like I am not properly back into shapes and workouts that I used to do last year have become difficult for me to do now which is frustrating... but part of the process. 

I am looking forward to running an 8k next (side note: I was able to run 6k+ whilst being at home many times whereas back in my hometown, I suddenly struggle with even shorter distances. Hope it's temporary but still wanna have a go at 8k and check out a new running trail). It's raining today so this will happen at some point next week. Also need to continue breaking in my new running shoes! 

Other than that: I have been tracking calories (mostly) consistently. For the first time, MFP assigned me 1450 kcal daily which is a lot more doable than the 1200 kcal it suggested in all my previous weight loss attempts - sadly, likely to do with my weight gain. Regardless, I don't remember overeating a notable amount on any day until now which is definitely a win! 

In June, I hope to 

* continue tracking calories and try more recipes. This should also decrease my takeout spending which is the biggest expense in my life aside from traveling (which overlaps largely with food expenses) - sorely needed seeing that I am about to move to a far more expensive city 
* Continue exercising and increasing my mileage. I think these small wins should keep up my motivation. I definitely want to get back to where I was at physically last year which I think shouldn't take me too long. 

Nothing else comes to mind.  Mostly maintaining what I started last month, though I feel I should add something new or more concrete... ",2,1748785279.0,loseit,1,1.0,False

I recognize I was fortunate to get a diagnosis quickly after the pain started so strongly last year. 

My doctor didn't give me any information on what to expect and never referred me to a specialist. 

While she did RX me lyrics and it has helped I'm still in pain daily and it feels like it just keeps getting worse. 

I'm trying to work again and get more hours but the days I don't work I just feel like I have to rest cause of the pain. I haven't been able to do any of my hobbies like crochet let alone household tasks. 

I see articals about flair ups but does that mean there are days where the pain isn't controlling my life? 

For context I'm 32 and currently working 2 part time jobs coffee shop and gas station. The job market is awful and I'm looking for a desk job. 

I've been using heating pads and drinking electrolyte drinks consistantly. I've got compression sleeves and gloves. Just nothing seems to help really.

1. The problem isn’t always in your mouth.
A lot of chronic breath issues come from post nasal drip, sinus problems, gut imbalances, or even metabolic conditions

2. Gum is temporary (if it works at all).
Even the strongest gum doesn’t neutralize odors from your nose or lungs. And for many of us, it doesn’t even work for 2 minutes. The second you speak, the smell comes right back or was never masked at all.

3. Mouthwash can make it worse.
Some mouthwashes contain alcohol that dries out your mouth, which reduces saliva and saliva is one of the body’s natural ways to fight odor. So overusing mouthwash will actually make the smell stronger over time.

4. These products were made for occasional breath issues not chronic ones.
They work fine if you just had garlic or coffee. But if your body is producing odor from the inside, no gum or rinse can reach the source of the problem.

So basically these products don’t treat what they were never designed for (Chronic bb)",1,1748784485.0,badbreath,2,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The performance of a coffee machine with a hot water dispenser hinges on several crucial features.

**Brewing Capacity:**

A coffee machine's brewing capacity directly impacts its suitability for different-sized households or offices. larger capacity machines, frequently enough holding 10-12 cups, are ideal for catering to multiple coffee drinkers. Smaller, more compact models, typically brewing 4-6 cups, are better suited for individuals or smaller families. The capacity also affects the size and footprint of the machine, influencing counter space considerations.

**Water Tank Capacity & Heating System:**

The water tank capacity dictates how many cups of coffee or hot water can be dispensed before a refill is needed. Larger tanks, ranging from 50 to 70 ounces or more, minimize the frequency of refills, especially helpful for frequent users. The heating system’s efficiency determines how quickly the water reaches the optimal temperature for brewing coffee or dispensing hot water. Rapid heating systems, utilizing technologies like thermoblock heating, can significantly reduce waiting times.

**Dispensing Mechanism & Temperature Control:**

A well-designed dispensing mechanism ensures a smooth and drip-free pour, minimizing spills and messes. It should also be easy to operate and clean. Precise temperature control is crucial for both coffee brewing and hot water dispensing. Different coffee types require specific water temperatures for optimal extraction, and having adjustable temperature settings allows for customization. Similarly, varying hot water temperatures can be useful for different tea varieties or other beverages.

**Programmability & User Interface:**

Programmability features, such as programmable brewing timers and automatic shut-off, enhance convenience and energy efficiency. A user-amiable interface, with clear buttons, a readable display, and intuitive controls, simplifies operation. Some machines offer smartphone connectivity, enabling remote control and customization of brewing parameters.

**Water Filtration System:**

A built-in water filtration system improves the taste of both coffee and hot water by removing impurities like chlorine and minerals. This not only enhances the flavor but also prolongs the lifespan of the machine by preventing scale buildup. Filtration systems typically use replaceable filters, requiring periodic replacement for optimal performance.

## Core Benefits

Owning a coffee machine with a hot water dispenser provides several distinct advantages over traditional coffee makers and separate kettles.

**Time Savings & Convenience:** A coffee machine with a hot water dispenser consolidates two essential functions into one appliance, saving valuable time and counter space. Instead of waiting for a separate kettle to heat water, you can instantly access hot water for tea, instant soups, or oatmeal. This is especially beneficial during busy mornings or when entertaining guests.

**Versatility & Multifunctionality:** These machines go beyond just brewing coffee. The hot water dispenser allows you to prepare a wide range of hot beverages, including tea, hot chocolate, and instant coffee. Some models even offer adjustable temperature settings, allowing you to customize the water temperature for different tea varieties. This versatility makes them a valuable addition to any kitchen.

**Space Optimization:** By combining the functions of a coffee maker and a kettle, these machines significantly reduce clutter on your countertop. This is particularly beneficial in smaller kitchens where space is limited. The streamlined design contributes to a cleaner and more organized kitchen environment.

**Cost Efficiency:** While the initial investment may be higher than a basic coffee maker or kettle, a coffee machine with a hot water dispenser can save money in the long run. By eliminating the need for separate appliances, you reduce energy consumption and the potential for future replacements.

## FAQs Section

**Can I use pre-ground coffee and coffee beans in this type of machine?**

It depends on the specific model. some machines are designed exclusively for pre-ground coffee, while others feature built-in grinders that allow you to use fresh coffee beans. Machines with grinders typically offer a superior coffee experience due to the freshness of the grounds.

**How frequently enough do I need to clean the coffee machine and descale it?**

Regular cleaning is essential to maintain optimal performance and prevent the buildup of coffee oils and mineral deposits. Refer to the manufacturer's instructions for specific cleaning procedures. Descaling frequency depends on the hardness of your water but is generally recommended every 1-3 months.

**What type of water filter is recommended, and how frequently enough should it be replaced?**

Most coffee machines with water filtration systems use replaceable charcoal filters. The recommended replacement frequency varies depending on the filter type and water usage, but it's typically every 1-2 months. Using the recommended filter type ensures optimal water quality and protects the machine from damage.

1l0osy0,https://i.redd.it/qr3q8bikgb4f1.jpeg,Gdańsk for Swedish folks,"Hi, 

I’m living in Gdańsk and hear a lot of Swedish language which is heard around hotels at the Center and a few places nearby. I feel that tons of great experiences are missed. It’s perfectly fine as how would you know? This is why I’m writing.

None of locals call the whole living area as Gdańsk, it’s called Tricity (Trójmiasto): Gdańsk + Sopot + Gdynia + I’m include 3 smaller cities aside. That’s the hint, why the place can offer much more.

**What Swedes are looking for in Gdańsk?**

Addressing my guesses first:

* Alcohol
   * That’s a match. Poland has a great selection for alcohol with good prices.
   * If it’s the case, have you tried Okowita made of potato? If not, it’s a gap.
* Food
   * I never heard any Swedish in places where the food is cool. Not to offend anyone, it’s just you should know places.
   * Food in areas around restaurants isn’t terrible, it’s just 3/5 of what you can get here.
* Girls
   * Polish girls speak Polish, Ukrainian girls speak Ukrainian, Belarusian girls speak russian. If you don’t speak these languages - fat chance.
   * Poland is a catholic traditional country, so the mentality is rather stringent in romantic affairs.
* Guys
   * I’d be surprised if it’s the case. But why not, we’re living in an interesting world.
* Landmarks and history
   * Again, who cares. But if you ones do, Gdańsk is a great spot for historical inquiry.
   * Gdańsk center offers great value but it’s 25% of what you can get from the whole Tricity.

Is it anything that I’m missing, that you (or your friends you know) are looking for?

**How can I help**

1. [Try these 12 daily tours](https://www.reddit.com/r/gdansk/comments/1k6yocm/list_of_experiences_in_tr%C3%B3jmiasto_12_are_there/?share_id=wt23mOPqPsgvrJeliqY1X&utm_content=1&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_source=share&utm_term=1) 2-4 hours each. Each is proven to be fine with actual walking through. Train connection is great, so if you have [Jakdojade](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://apps.apple.com/us/app/jakdojade-timetables/id506795511&ved=2ahUKEwjLoJStn9CNAxWKR_EDHX_hKKwQFnoECAsQAQ&usg=AOvVaw2jnpmjGw86pcNkfYoaHL0X) on your phone.
2. In Gdańsk center, can show you best places to eat out and have a speciality coffee.
3. Know history of Eastern Europe holistically, can link it to stuff you know. It may be an interesting exercise.
4. If you’re into wines, likely can organise wine tasting. It’s not super easy here but I know the places already + tasted 550 wines as a recreational player 😁
5. Gdynia, is “city of dreams” and many polish folks are dreaming to live there. It’s interesting, surprisingly it’s UNESCO heritage, some yachts, tasty food, sea, views. If you’re there, you’d one of a few from your land 😎
6. I know many stories you’d never hear otherwise. Topics include: tech startups from trenches, Ukrainian Maydan, 90-s in Eastern Europe, totalitarian vibe in Minsk inside out.
7. Eating out. Trying local dishes (polish in general, Pomorskie) and tasty stuff around (boring Italian but so well done and on a budget).
8. Planning a wider trip through Poland, as there’s so many things to see and experience without breaking the bank. Example: staying in monasteries, eating great local food, local wine from Zielona Góra, finding a remote tech job that pays the same as in Sweden.

**My interest**

1. Practice of the language is appreciated. As I know some Norwegian and turns out Swedish is comprehensible for me. Turns out it’s super helpful to listen, comprehend and reply.
2. General interest Swedish culture and current affairs.
3. I’m not local either so chit chatting with non-locals has a value of discovery. 

**Main question**

Does it make sense and is helpful for you? 

This post is fuelled by my curiosity and a will to be helpful where I clearly can help. It could be that I’m thinking too much, folks are coming, having relaxed fun and nothing more is expected so the system functions perfectly.

I am the lurker at the bottom of the lake, watching people swim, cannonball, and sometimes drown at different strata of the water. You smirk, but I say strategic spotting. I am surprised I decided to write an ad myself, effectively breaking my lurker status. Curiosity does indeed kill the cat, and then some.

I am also the type to wake up from an intense dream and feel compelled, almost forced, to contemplate the moral qualms, ethical boundaries, real-world implications of particular details of that dream, and then lastly my own place relative to all those things. If you are someone who, while not a slave to the dreamscapes, is fascinated by the lessons they teach, I can see us having quite a few amusing, if not engrossing, conversations on the subject.

Now, here is arguably the ultimate surprise of all: I am an aspiring writer. It is my dream to publish. Also, a book muncher/hoarder, and yes, we can talk about those too. But don't get the wrong impression. I don't know jack about 💩.

Here's a snapshot of my interests:

\- History: I enjoy ""nerdy/geeky stuff"", as per the lingo. I cannot get enough of wartime history, especially WWII, ESPECIALLY the Germans' side and their occult shenanigans in the dark. Himmler be crazy. A friend also got me hooked on the world of the cowboys, saloon girls, excruciating smells, and cholera, introducing me to the world of Red Dead Redemption 2, much to my initial reservation since I was never a fan of Westerns. Now I am a couple of miles worming down the rabbit hole, and she's... gone.

\- Books: History, mythology/folklore, adventure/mystery, horror, some fantasy, and Sci-fi. Been reading up a lot on the history of vampires from around the world, since I'm world-building for a re-imagination of the Dracula mythos. I will admit to having a sizeable collection of works set in the Warhammer 40,000. I have been a huge fan of that universe since I was a kid. Imagine my pleasant surprise when it suddenly received a resurgence of popularity thanks to the release of the game Space Marine II and Amazon Prime's anthology Secret Level.

\- Music: Older Motowns, movie soundtracks, city pop, and a sprinkling mix of Jazz, R&B, opera, oldies, and 90s/80s pop. Gotta get the funk in the trunk, you dig? The buffet is ripe, I'm telling ya. Artists that will always have a special place in my heart no matter how much time has passed: The Carpenters, DeBarge, and Michael Bublé.

\- Movies/shows: Occult, mystery, horror, fantasy, sci-fi, occasional action thriller (pretty picky about this). I do venture out of these genres from time to time, since I am a sucker for good storytelling. I used to do the Harry Potter and LoTR marathons at least once a year each.

\- Food: I love all kinds of food, and I can throw down pretty hard in the kitchen. My secret weapon? I can make Pho from scratch. And I can make FLAN. I am not a picky eater, but raw cucumber is a hit or miss for me. Tea > Coffee, but I do drink both.

\- Something else about me: 1) I learned hobby-woodworking from the dire need to make cabinets for my fish. 2) I shook hands with the dude who played Ed Warren from the Conjuring series (I know his name, writing it this way amuses me.) 3) I was a combat medic once.

\- Others: I do game occasionally. When I do, I also go for those with good storytelling. See a pattern? The only multiplayer I consistently return to is League. The game has nostalgic value to me. Started playing it in 09 when a college friend invited me at the time.Some titles I love: Warhammer-40K titles, Call of Duty (2, 3, and WWII only, surprise!), zombie shooters, Strange Brigade, WB's Middle-earth series (SoM, SoW), Red Dead Redemption 2 (Online), Biohazard/Resident Evil, Crysis series, Green Hell, Zombie Army Trilogy.

Last but not least, I leave my ""looking-for"" box open. I enjoy the process of getting to know someone new. And a solid friendship is the foundation for all other types of healthy relationships. A rushed or forced meal can mean an upset stomach (unless you've been in the military), and often unsatisfied diners (but holy moly, the ones only looking to get their rocks off).

I am addicted to great storytelling, if I had to pigeonhole. Think Taylor, her comical house-on-fire past relationships, and the million-dollar songs that came from them, OR maybe it's more like the song Sunset Boulevard. Go for the John Barrowman version, it's great.

Jokes aside, my mind is open, and I try to keep it open for as long as I can. Whatever comes, comes. I am straight, and the post was tagged as M4F, but I welcome friends from all genders. I went by the book to keep things simple. 

With all of that mumbo-jumbo said, here is me and there is you. Grab a seat. Stay a while. Leave your worries at the door.

1l0or2p,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christians/comments/1l0or2p/guidance_needed/,Guidance Needed,"hi everyone, I'm hoping to get some guidance on a sensitive issue that's been weighing heavily on me.

i've been single my whole life, and ghosted, and rejected endlessly by men which has ruined my self esteem. i've always been surrounded by close friends and family in happy relationships which is further isolating, and just disheartening. 

The first and only man i've ever loved pursued me, we video called, had a joint playlist, made date plans, he asked for my favourite flowers, only to ghost me after 3 weeks of daily conversation. after that, a different guy messaged me asking me out to coffee, I said yes and asked when he was free, and he ghosted me.

I just have this deep feeling that I am not meant to be romantically loved. I used to be optimistic about this, but my experiences have only supported the opposite. I don't feel enough or like i'm worth loving. I know we aren't promised a partner, but I don't know why I have this desire and am being tortured with it. 

As a result, i've pulled away from God and feel frustrated with him and resentful. I tried reading my Bible for the first time in several months because i'm ""supposed to"" as a Christian, but I honestly don't feel anything and don't want a relationship with someone who is willingly putting me through the constant pain and loneliness of being single and undesirable which burdens me every day.

It has made me really bitter and honestly depressed. i'm not the happy person I once was. I've asked God to repent for any sins i've missed but i'm not sure where to even go from here, if I continue in my faith.

thanks for reading. I appreciate any kind and thoughtful advice you can offer. 🌸

Kidneys are very important filters for our body. They work hard for us every day. But often we do not think about them. Simple choices in food and how we live can help them stay strong. Small changes can make big difference for kidney health. I want to show how caring for kidneys is easy with right food and life ways.

Understanding Your Kidneys: Essential Functions
-----------------------------------------------

Our kidneys are like cleaning machines. They filter blood always. Bad waste is taken out by them. They balance water and salt in the body. This keeps everything working right inside. Blood pressure is controlled with their help. Kidneys also make hormone for red blood cells. They help make bones strong too. Many jobs are done by these two organs.

Common Threats to Kidney Health
-------------------------------

Some things are not kind to kidneys. Having sugar sickness hurts them bad. High blood pressure is another big enemy for kidneys. When body carries too much weight, kidneys feel the strain. Smoking puts poisons in blood vessels everywhere, including kidneys. These conditions make kidneys get sick slowly. We must know these dangers to protect kidneys.

Why Early Intervention is Crucial
---------------------------------

Fixing problems for kidneys early is very good. If we wait, damage can get too much. Kidneys cannot grow new filter parts easily. Starting healthy food and life habits soon stops sickness from getting worse. This saves kidney power for many years. Simple steps taken today give kidneys best chance tomorrow. Early action makes a large positive change.

Controlling Sodium Intake for Kidney Function
---------------------------------------------

Eating much salt is hard on kidneys. Salt makes blood pressure go up. High blood pressure hurts kidney filters over time. We get much salt from packaged foods and restaurant meals. Look at food labels to see salt number. Eating less salt helps keep blood pressure low. People eat much more salt than body needs. Lower salt means kidneys do not work so hard.

Balancing Protein Consumption
-----------------------------

Protein is food our body needs. But too much protein can make kidneys work very hard. Kidneys clean waste from protein. If much protein is eaten, much waste is made. This makes kidney filters tired. It is better to eat right amount of protein. Chicken, fish, beans are good protein foods. Finding the balance is important for kidney health.

Prioritizing Hydration
----------------------

Drinking enough clean water helps kidneys do their job well. Water helps kidneys wash away waste from blood. It is like cleaning a pipe with water. If not enough water, waste is hard to clean out. Drink simple water most times. Do not drink many sugary drinks. Too much coffee or alcohol is also not good. Right water amount helps kidneys filter smoothly.

Embracing a Kidney-Friendly Diet Pattern
----------------------------------------

Eating foods from plants is very good for kidneys. Fruits and vegetables are full of helpful things. Grains that are not white, like brown rice, are better. These foods give body good power. They help all body parts, including kidneys. Special parts in these foods, like antioxidants, protect kidney cells. Eating good plant food helps kidneys work well.

The Power of Regular Physical Activity
--------------------------------------

Moving the body often helps kidneys. When we do exercise, blood pressure gets lower. It also helps keep blood sugar numbers steady. Walking, simple moves, running are good. Try to move body almost every day. Exercise makes the whole body work better. Lower pressure and sugar mean less work for kidneys.

Maintaining a Healthy Weight
----------------------------

Carrying extra weight on body puts stress on kidneys. It makes blood pressure higher. It can bring sugar sickness. Losing some extra weight is very helpful. Eat good food and move body to get to better weight. Healthy body weight takes pressure off kidneys. This helps them keep working for a long time.

When the connection was lost a few years ago, I didn’t think much of it.  
But I lingered.  
Waiting for a pop-up message.  
Waiting for *you*.

Even as your life changed—  
Even after I dated people who weren’t you—  
I still found myself closing my eyes, expecting to hear from you again.

I tried.  
I met new people.  
I forced myself to feel something.

But no matter how many conversations I started,  
how many “good morning” texts I got from someone else,  
I couldn’t see a future with anyone.

**Five years.**  
And the moment I saw you again…  
The moment your eyes met mine that night—  
I knew.  
It was still you.

You were the one who made me feel first.  
The one who courted me.  
The one who taught me what butterflies felt like.

It has always been you.

So yes—after all these years, it’s still you I long for.  
And when we got another chance, I took it.

Even with conditions.  
Even with hesitation.  
Even with old wounds still tender.

Because it was you.  
You were worth the time.  
Worth the effort.  
Worth the understanding.

But maybe, deep down, I knew I was holding on too tightly.  
Because you weren’t really holding on at all.

You treated me poorly.  
You were inconsistent.  
And yet, I still stayed.

It’s hard—looking at you,  
knowing what you shared with her.

Still, I chose you.

You told me I wasn’t a mistress.  
That I came at the right time.  
And I believed you.

But then came the silence.  
The once-a-week messages.  
The late-night coffee invitations,  
only when it was convenient for you.

Even when I was half-asleep,  
I still waited for that message.

Loser? Maybe.  
But I called it love.

You told our friends your feelings for me never changed.  
That even after all this time, you still yearned for me.

And so I stayed.  
Like the foolish girl I’ve always been with you.

If only you knew—  
How tired I am.  
How long I’ve waited.  
How I still responded, even when my heart was running on empty.

Despite everything,  
I never stopped longing for you.

But now, as you drift away again,  
I finally see it.

We don’t work—not because we didn’t love each other.  
But because *you only want me when I’m beside you.*  
And once I’m not… your interest fades.

You don’t love me.  
You love the idea of me.  
The illusion you created in your head.  
But not the real me.

And that hasn’t changed.

You want me to be the one who lets go.  
So you can say I gave up.  
So you never have to face the truth.  
That you just loved me badly.

So here’s the question I keep asking:  
**If I let go… will that finally make you feel better?**  
Or will it only prove that I was the only one who ever truly held on?

Recently my brother, who is seventeen years old, has been staying with myself and my sister in our household for a short period of time and plans to stay with us over the summer as he wants to be closer to his friends. 

Unfortunately, I am having difficulty watching him sit around all day, gorging on fast food, sleeping in until 2pm and proceeding to sit on his phone all day. I understand he is a teenager, but this reaches further back as he does not attend school regularly, his parents try to wake him in the mornings but as he cannot be woken, they just leave him there for the day. As such, he didn’t not attend his end of year exams last week and has no interest in academics. 

I have been struggling with a way to approach and motivate him without allowing myself to have an emotional response, because I feel it will be counter intuitive and only make him regress further into his sloth behaviour. His friends work throughout the day and he wishes to spend his time waiting for them to be done so he can hang out with them. 

He wants to get a job, but lacks the motivation to do it. I brought him around our town two weeks ago, knocking into coffee shops to see if they were hiring and he was lucky enough to get a trial shift, which he unfortunately didn’t pass, which I felt was a step in the right direction. 

I just don’t want him to sit around and not working towards improving himself and realising not to take for granted the benefits he has, such as education and youth. His parents are disinterested in motivating him due to their own issues and my Mother would much prefer if he didn’t go to university as it would be a struggle for them financially, there are plenty of options for him to attend university through government schemes in my country but she has no interest in looking into them. 

Any advice on this would be appreciated, I’ve been reflecting on this for a few days and I’m trying to find a proactive and non-emotional approach to trying to steer him in a beneficial direction. 

Thank you. ",1,1748782998.0,Stoicism,2,0.67,False
1l0ofdd,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1l0ofdd/how_much_more_shall_i_suffer_before_i_find_my/,how much more shall i suffer before i find my peace?,"long post alert! no tldr either, just wanted to get this off my chest. wrote this after waking up at 3 am again for the nth time this past month...

It's 3 AM again, and i'm staring at the ceiling, asking the same question that has haunted me for seven years now: how much longer must this ache live in my chest before it finally finds its way out? should i really be living like a prisoner of the past?

2016 feels like yesterday and a lifetime ago all at once. a random message that i sent on an app I barely remember the name of now, a simple question that would unknowingly reshape the architecture of my heart. she had this way of typing that made even the most mundane conversatios feel like poetry. her laugh, even through voice messages, could light up the darkest corners of my day. we were strangers from different parts of india who became everything to each(atleast in my thought) other, connected by nothing more than pixels on a screen and the strange magic that sometimes happens when two souls recognize each other across the digital void.

for two beautiful, chaotic years, she was my first thought in the morning and my last whisper to the night. We talked about everything and nothing our dreams, our fears, the way coffee tastes better when you're thinking about someone you love, the okay okay sequence in tfios. we made plans we never kept, promises we couldn't fulfill, and built a love that existed entirely in the space between ""send"" and ""delivered.""

then 2018 came, and with it, silence. Not the comfortable silence of understanding, but the deafening quiet of absence. the last message sits there still, unanswered, like a question mark that will never find its period. i don't even remember what it said anymore, but I remember the hope I felt sending it, and the slow, crushing realization that no reply would come.

nine years have passed since that first mesage. seven years since her last goodbye.

i've tried to move forward, tried to love again, tried to convince myself that what we had was just a beautiful mistake, a digital mirage that felt real because i was lonely. for the first one or two years ive tried to date others, looked into other eyes searching for that same spark but nothing lasted more than a week maybe.every relationship, every effort to find hu someone new felt like I'm betraying a ghost, loving with only half a heart because the other half is still trapped in 2016, refreshing an app that no longer exists.

people say time heals all wounds, but they never mention how some wounds become part of you, how some pain becomes so familiar it feels like home. i wake up in the middle of the night not because I'm thinking about her, but because somewhere in my dreams, I never stopped talking to her. my subconscious refuses to accept what my rational mind knows to be true- that she is gone, that we are over, that whatever we were was never meant to survive in the real world.

the cruelest part isn't missing her. It's missing who I was when I was hers. i was funnier then, more hopeful, more alive. i copy pasted terrible poetry for her, sent bad jokes and sent good morning texts and believed in the kind of love that novels are made of. now I'm just tired, going around for a job in morning in the busiest city of india, wearing a fake smile, carrying around this beautiful yet devastating story that no one else understands because they never met her, never known us, never witnessed the small miracle of two people falling in love through screens and wires and faith. carrying around this beautiful yet devastating story that no one else understands because they never met her, never known us, never witnessed the small miracle of two people falling in love through screens and wires and faith.

so today i ask again, to whoever might be listening- the universe, the god, the ghost of what we used to be- how much more shall i suffer, before i find my peace? how much more must i carry this? When will this love(or infatuation maybe, i don't know)stop feeling like drowning?

1l0of5m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1l0of5m/mobile_hot_beverage_truck/,Mobile Hot Beverage Truck,"Picture this: a brightly colored truck rolling into a bustling neighborhood, its cheerful exterior promising warmth and comfort on bustling streets. Who wouldn’t want to take a quick break from the craziness of errands to grab a steaming cup of joy? The smell of rich coffee, sweet tea, and creamy hot chocolate wafts through the air, luring passersby like a siren's call. The truth is, selling drinks from a truck can be an art form—one that could warm both hearts and hands, regardless of the season.

Let's imagine it’s autumn. You could deck out your truck with decorations that make it look like it just rolled out of a Pinterest board dedicated to cozy vibes. Think pumpkins, hay bales, and colorful leaves swirling in the breeze. As customers approach, you could greet them with a playful smile, “Welcome to your pumpkin-spice therapy session! You get one free hug with every drink, and we promise not to judge if you want extra whipped cream.” It's about creating a cozy space that feels more like a community gathering than just a quick stop for a drink.

Winter would take it up a notch too. You can sprinkle some flurries of cheer around your truck with twinkling lights and a soft holiday playlist playing in the background. How about special hot chocolate varieties, like “Peppermint Wonderland” or “S’mores Extravaganza”? You could even wrap your hands around a cup of your creation and share a moment of vulnerability, telling your customers, ""Yep, I too have felt underqualified to tackle life. But let’s get warm and see where the day takes us!"" Everyone craves connection during the colder months, so why not offer it over a cup of something delicious?

As spring arrives, your truck could be adorned with flowers and cheerful colors, offering refreshing iced teas and fruity beverages. You might say, “Spring is nature’s way of reminding us that we can be renewed. Grab an iced tea and let’s sip to new beginnings!” Opening up conversations about fresh starts or personal journeys can create a bond with your customers, allowing you to share spiritual reflections about how growth often requires some messy moments.

And let’s not forget summer, a season that practically begs for street-side lemonade and iced coffee! Imagine your truck offering “Tropical Paradise” smoothies or “Sunset Sippers” that taste like sunshine. Along with the drinks, you might provide a shaded area for folks to hang out a little longer. As they sip on something fruity, you can remind them of the importance of slowing down and enjoying life’s sweet moments. “We all need to taste the sunshine, even if it comes in a cup, right?”

Throughout the year, you can integrate little Bible verses or inspirational quotes on your cups or the side of your truck. Think of this as an invitation for your customers to reflect—a chance to consider what spiritual growth might look like for them as they savor each sip. You could wrap up your day by inviting everyone to share their favorite drink of the season on social media, creating a joyful community that extends past the everyday hustle.

So whether it’s coffee, tea, or hot chocolate that steams up from your truck, let it be a beacon of warmth and comfort in busy neighborhoods. It’s not just about the drinks—it’s about building connections, creating a sense of community, and finding the sacred moments in our everyday lives. And who knows? Perhaps those moments will serve as a catalyst for transformation, both in you and the people you serve. Let’s raise our cups and say “yes” to this flavorful adventure!",1,1748782885.0,HustleAndFaith,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The swissklip Teeth Whitening Foam boasts several extraordinary features that contribute to its efficacy and user-friendliness.

This formula utilizes a blend of peroxide-based agents and other active ingredients designed to penetrate tooth enamel and break down stains. The specific concentration of these whitening agents is carefully calibrated to maximize effectiveness while minimizing the risk of sensitivity.

**Foam Delivery system:** Unlike traditional gels or strips, Swissklip employs a foam delivery system.

These ingredients help to protect the tooth enamel from damage and erosion during the whitening process. The formula is free from harsh abrasives that can scratch or weaken the enamel, promoting long-term oral health.

I'm currently shopping for a new house and a large kitchen is a hard requirement. This means I will finally be able to get a proper setup. My budget is about €3k for both a grinder and an espresso machine.

Some thoughts:

* I prefer the 'funkier' coffees, (anaerobic) naturals, light/medium roast. Not sure if this would affect the choice for either grinder or machine.
* I also like pour-overs (V60) , so a grinder that would be able to do both well would be a plus. I currently use a ZP6 for my pour overs, and I enjoy the clarity it provides.
* I'd like the workflow to be as low-friction as possible, so a grind-by-weight grinder would be nice (unless there are too many compromises), as well as a machine that's plumbable.
* Milk drinks are less important, I'd like to be able to offer them to guests but I don't expect to drink a lot of them myself as I am not a baby cow.
* I'm not sure how to allocate the budget between grinder and machine.

*First sip goes silent—*  
*dopamine still whispering*  
*but nothing lands right*

It doesn’t announce itself.

Burnout. Overstimulation. The slow fuzz of too-muchness. It doesn’t come with sirens or red flags. It creeps.

It looks like productivity. Like research. Like staying connected. It dresses up as curiosity, ambition, even care.

You tell yourself you’re just catching up. Just one more scroll. Just one more article. Just one more message to reply to.

You’re good at it. Better than you realize. Gathering dopamine like berries in a forest. Every ping, every click, every tiny red bubble—a soft hit. A little reward. A hit of novelty. You become a collector of fragments.

Then one day the coffee doesn’t taste like anything.

Not bad. Not good. Just… flat.

That’s when I usually know. Not from my sleep, or my thoughts, or even my body. From that cup. The ritual that usually centers me. Suddenly unmoored.

A few years ago, I stayed in a rented room above a ceramic studio in rural Nara. The owner, a man in his seventies who had stopped glazing pottery because he said the silence became too loud, lived below.

Every morning, he would make coffee. One single cup. Always black. Always the same chipped mug.

One morning, I asked him how he knew when the seasons were changing. There had been no shift in weather, no announcement.

He didn’t look up.

“The ants walk differently,” he said. “Faster when the rain comes. Slower when it leaves.”

He paused.

“And the coffee loses its shape in the mouth. Like it wants to be tea.”

It didn’t make sense at the time. It does now.

The body knows. The ritual knows. Long before the mind catches up.

So much of modern living is frictionless. That’s the trap. It allows you to glide right past the red lights inside you. You become so used to being slightly overstimulated that silence feels like a glitch. You start chasing stimulation not for pleasure, but for regulation. You forget what baseline feels like.

And then the coffee goes quiet.

# Wabi-Sabi Reminders for the Unplugging Kind:

* **The signal to unplug rarely feels urgent. That’s why it matters.**
* **When simple joys dull, it’s not your fault. It’s your capacity.**
* **The most dangerous addiction is the one that feels productive.**
* **Your clarity returns when your input slows.**
* **Familiar things change shape first. Watch the coffee. Watch the ants.**

So I unplug. Slowly. Not with a grand digital detox. But by washing the dishes without music. By walking without my phone. By making one good cup of coffee and doing nothing else until it’s gone.

Because when the taste returns— when the first sip lands again like sunlight through fog— that’s when I know I’m back.

And until then, I rest. I rinse the sponge. I let the noise dissolve.

Not because I’m done. But because I want to be ready when it’s time to begin again",4,1748782343.0,burnedout,0,1.0,False

1l0o6xi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1l0o6xi,Show me your fan characters!,"Surely I can’t be the only one who always ends up making a fan oc if I’m in a fandom long enough(or get punted into that universe hard enough upon initially finding it)

I’d like to see your fan characters! Are you still in the fandom? did it take you long to give in to making them?

the ones I have here are

Choc Marble cookie - Cookie Run; I havnt actively played Oven Break or Kingdom in years now, infact I can’t even remember if I was playing either game WHEN I created him, but he exists and I made him some time within the year that Kingdom released

Karro - Sonic; honestly don’t know why he exists but I (try to) love him anyway, got real into Sonic for probably only a couple weeks when the first movie came out, I’d barely even finished his design by the time I lost that phase lol

Spika - Lilo and Stitch; one of my first fan characters, I’ve always loved the (animated)movie. Never really planned to make my own character for it though, Spika came about during university where one of our tasks was to create 6(?) characters that could fit into existing media (can try find the original piece with all of them if anyone’s interested, a couple of the others were from Paw Patrol, Bananya, Fairly odd parents, Duck tales etc) and so I bit the bullet and made him, love him to pieces, one day plan to try make him a plush lol

Silas(blue hair) - Harry Potter(games); pictured with my mates character(and his twin sister) Eve, we always create them in the games, and have extensive lore on how they keep existing/how the stories slightly change etc with them both being present at the same time(since obviously in the games your character is the sole protagonist)

(From top left to bottom right) Octavious, Smudge, Cho, Temi, Eddie and Yaki - Splatoon; Cho, Temi and Eddie belong to my mate again, Octavious and Smudge were my in game characters, Yaki was created just cause I wanted something differnt to an Inkling or an Octoling(Eddie was created by friend for the same reason, they love each other in case you were wondering)

Astarte and Asmodeus, SilverFox and Coffee Liqueur, Solar Splash and Rainbow Rift - My little pony; this isn’t even all of them! I don’t have much to do with the fandom anymore but I can never help myself when it comes to creating characters for it, can make my own little city of them honestly, my very first fan character was for MLP, shes called MilkyWay and I feel like I should have put a picture of her in this but oh well, she also started as a Ponysona but slowly escaped that. 
Astarte and Asmodeus are a redesign of one of my first ponies called “Demon”(look at me being a very creative edgy preteen). He was an earth pony who had a ‘demon form’. Redesigning some characters last year(I want to say minimum 10 years after his first creation) and I couldn’t decide  between making him a dragon or a bat pony, so instead I turned him into two characters(and named them after demons, for some consistency) 
Silver is the father of MilkyWay and her older brother Milo, Coffee is his accidental husband(eventually everything seems to just become gay, blame my brain) 
Rift and Solar I *think* started as a fan species(? Is it species if they’re just a different type of pony) of mlp, but I redesigned them last year as well and they became their own seperate thing, wouldn’t be able to tell you the name of the original species, all I could tell you is that they were two seperate ones, but they were always suppose to be twins so I don’t know why younger me did that

Honestly if you read all that thank you, I tend to ramble when it comes to my OCs but I’ve tried to keep it at least sort of short… please don’t hesitate to word vomit at me about your OCs, though! And if you’d like to hear more about any of the ones pictured- or any of my others that aren’t- I’d only be overjoyed to continue my ramblings

1l0o4ae,https://www.reddit.com/r/loseit/comments/1l0o4ae/is_it_possible_to_become_effortlessly_thin_and/,Is it possible to become 'effortlessly thin' and stop needing to eat all the damn time??,"Hey folks. I am newly engaged so I need to get the weight off once and for all before my wedding. I've been thinking about delving into the awful calorie deficit struggle yet again, and I'm just going insane wondering how on earth all my 'effortlessly thin' friends do it.

I feel like I think about food 24/7. My stomach literally just loudly grumbled and squirmed at me to eat as I was typing this. Right now I'm thinking about how relieving it would be to go downstairs and eat. When I haven't eaten for a few hours I feel ravenous, my stomach feels physically empty and makes sounds at me, and sometimes I feel nauseous and even dizzy or cramping if I haven't recently eaten.

I recently travelled for the first time with a few friends who are all naturally thin. They enjoy food and get excited about sweet treats and good meals. However, I noticed my appetite was SO much more insistent than theirs. Whenever we arrived somewhere I was always the first one to ask where we were eating. 
Often they would only have a coffee for breakfast and nothing else until like 4pm. I would be nearly passing out if I tried that! I just can't understand how they don't think about food.

Another example is my cousin. She LOVES food and can pack away huge meals, more than I can. But I know she must go long stretches without eating or eat very light meals the rest of the day. She is very thin and has a model-esque body without trying.

I was with another group of effortlessly thin friends last night. We all ordered the exact same plate of hot chips loaded with yiros meat. We all finished the meal. And yet, I weigh so much more than them; I know they have to eat much, much less the rest of the day to be able to maintain as they do.

I physically and mentally cannot fathom how they do it. I really dislike the physical pain and discomfort of not eating. Do these people not experience the same discomfort? Or do they experience it but just not care?

I know some people will ask about the types of food I eat. I eat a healthy diet with lots of veggies and protein. Maybe a few too many carbs at times. But my day-to-day consists of whole foods (often stuff I've grown myself) and lean meats. One of the girls I travelled with had a chai latte for breakfast and a handful of chocolate cookies for dinner. How does she do it?? What the actual eff??

I know enough about myself, and I've tried to lose weight enough times, that I know I can't just 'white-knuckle' through these feelings. White-knuckling food noise ALL DAY is too demanding. As soon as I'm a little tired and run down, or the urges get to strong, I'm eating again.

I've done all the introspection, I've worked through Brain over Binge and know what causes me to overeat. I understand how habits work and how to break them. I follow those intuitive eating folks who talk about how to wait until hunger and stop before fullness. But I just can't seem to stop wanting to eat ALL the time. 

Has anyone else ever successfully 'turned off' their appetite without GLPs? I won't be eligible for GLPs because I'm not actually overweight BMI wise. I teeter on the edge of being overweight but fortunately I'm quite active, and I can usually willpower myself into a calorie deficit for JUST long enough to get me back into a 'healthy' BMI. But then the cycle starts again.

Can anyone even explain WHY I seem to be so much more affected by food noise and hunger pangs?? Is there some genetic or hormonal reason keeping me from being able to forget about food for more than a few hours, like my effortlessly thin friends? Could a medication be causing this? Why is my stomach always squealing at me?

Sorry for the rant - I'm just mystified and fed up! And I don't know if I have the ability to endure the obsessiveness needed to lose weight, even though I want it desperately.",48,1748781989.0,loseit,57,0.94,False

Ever been there? That crushing feeling where everyone else seems to have some secret manual for life and you're just... existing?

I wasn't depressed exactly. I wasn't broke or homeless. I was just **direction less a**nd somehow that felt worse than having actual problems.

**Here's what I realized:** You don't find your purpose. You build it, one small experiment at a time.

All those ""follow your passion"" people? They're wrong. Most of us don't have some burning calling waiting to be discovered. We have to create meaning through action.

# The Framework That's Actually Working:

Step 1: Stop Searching for THE Answer

* Your purpose isn't hiding in a meditation retreat or career quiz
* Start with what pisses you off about the world
* Ask: ""What small problem could I actually help solve?""

Step 2: Run Mini-Experiments

* Volunteer for 2 hours somewhere
* Take a weekend course in something random
* Have coffee with people doing interesting work
* Try things for curiosity, not commitment

Step 3: Follow Your Energy, Not Your Logic

* Notice what activities make you lose track of time
* Pay attention to conversations that light you up
* Stop doing things that drain you just because you ""should""

Step 4: Build Something, Anything

* Start a small project (blog, side hustle, community group)
* Creating something gives you direction even when you don't know where you're going
* Momentum beats motivation every time

# What's Changed for Me:

I started tutoring kids in math (random experiment). Realized I love explaining complex things simply. Now I'm building an online course about personal finance for young adults.

Is it my ""life purpose""? Who knows. But I wake up excited to work on it, and that's enough for now.

Your future self is waiting for you to start moving, even if you don't know where you're going yet.

1l0nv8h,https://i.redd.it/wx89w6bd8b4f1.jpeg,Night shift fried rice,"Recipe: 

Step 0:
Forget you were making rice last night, and leave it in the rice cooker on 'keep warm' for 8 hours. This overcooks the rice and dries it out. It also leaves a nice crust on the bottom of the rice cooker.

Step 0.5:
Make stir fry sauce. Whisk 1 part soy sauce with half parts each oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, Sriracha and Chinese cooking wine. Add a few drops of toasted sesame oil and chinkiang vinegar, as well as a pinch of sugar because it just felt right. 

Step 1:
Season the pan. Trim skin off 1 finger length piece of cooked pork belly, where you fucked up the skin and it isnt crispy. Worry about the skin later (make Roman-style pork and beans, serve with red wine and crusty bread). Dice the pork fat and fry 6 cloves of minced garlic in the lovely foamy fat. Empty crispy garlic and pork fat into the bowl of stir fry sauce. 

Step 2: 
Fry the rice. Coat pan with sunflower oil and heat until shimmering. Add just a little too much rice to the pan, about 2 cups. Overcrowding the pan leads to soggy rice. Do your best little saute snap and flip the rice around every minute or two. Upon feeling accomished, push rice to edges of pan and crack two eggs into the middle of the pan. Fry for a minute before mixing the eggs into the rest of the rice. Keep everything moving and carmelizing evenly. 

Step 3: 
Add the sauce. Pour it around the edges of the pan so it carmelizes a bit too, then incorporate it into your egg rice mixture. Continue frying until rice has reached desired texture, or not. I'm not your supervisor. 

Step 4: 
Serve rice in bowl. Eat some, and realize it's pretty bland. Empty bowl contents back into pan and add some diced ham to the pan since hams were $2. Toss in a cup of frozen mixed vegetals wishing you had just peas. Continue frying until everything looks like above picture. Serve with coffee because it's 6am. Time is an illusion and God is dead.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Losing weight feels very difficult for many people. People look for new ways to help. Putting coconut oil in hot coffee is something some people try. They think this can help lose body weight. You might ask how much oil you should add. I will tell you about the amount people use. I will also talk about why they do this. Then I will say what things you should think about. You will learn if this coffee drink really works like people hope. It is not a magic trick. This writing will help you learn the facts about adding this oil to your morning drink for body weight goals.

Why People Add Coconut Oil to Coffee for Weight Loss
----------------------------------------------------

Some people put coconut oil in their morning coffee cup. They hope this will help their body lose weight. This idea comes from the type of fat in coconut oil. Inside this oil are special fats called MCTs. MCT stands for Medium-Chain Triglycerides. My body handles these fats in a different way than other fats. People believe these MCT fats can make you feel full longer. This might stop you from eating too much food. They also think it can give you quick energy. It might even make your body burn calories a little faster for a short time. Knowing why people use this oil in coffee is good before you try it.

The Big Question: How Much Coconut Oil is Recommended?
------------------------------------------------------

Many people ask how much coconut oil is right to add to their coffee. There is no one size that fits every person. It is best to start with a little amount first. Then you can put more later slowly. Most people start with one small teaspoon in their coffee cup. Many people then try to use one or two bigger tablespoons later. It is very important not to start with a lot of oil. Putting too much oil first can make your stomach feel bad. It can upset your body inside. Starting small and adding more over days is smart.

Factors Influencing Your Coconut Oil Dosage: Your Tolerance
-----------------------------------------------------------

The amount of coconut oil you put in coffee can be different for you. It depends on your body. What amount works for one person may not work for you. Your body needs to get used to this oil. Putting too much coconut oil can make your stomach hurt. It can make you need to go to the bathroom fast. This is a common problem. Starting with only one teaspoon helps your body learn to handle it. If your stomach feels bad, use less oil or stop it. Adding more oil step by step over many days is a good plan. Find what your body feels okay with.

Factors Influencing Your Coconut Oil Dosage: Your Overall Diet and Calorie Intake
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Putting coconut oil in your coffee adds more energy to your drink. This oil has many calories and fat. One big tablespoon has about 120 calories. It also has 14 grams of fat. If you want to lose weight, you must think about these extra calories. You must eat fewer calories in other foods. If you add oil but eat the same amount of other food, you might gain weight. This is not good for losing weight. Think about all the food you eat in a day. See how the oil calories fit into your plan.

How to Properly Add Coconut Oil to Your Coffee: Choosing the Right Type of Coconut Oil
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding coconut oil to your hot coffee is easy. Some people like to choose special types of oil. They pick virgin or extra-virgin coconut oil. They like the taste and think it is very pure. But the special fats, the MCTs, are what help with the body things. Sometimes people use only MCT oil. This is like the good part of coconut oil in strong form. It might not upset the stomach as much in small amounts. It does not have the coconut taste. Pick the oil you like or the one that is good for your body.

How to Properly Add Coconut Oil to Your Coffee: Blending for Best Results
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When you put coconut oil in hot coffee, it might just float on top. This does not taste good. It feels oily to drink. To make it mix well, you need to blend it. This is the best way. You can use a regular machine called a blender. Or you can use a hand blender that goes in the cup. Mix the hot coffee and the oil together for maybe 20 or 30 seconds. This makes the fat tiny pieces in the drink. The coffee becomes smooth and looks like a creamy drink. People call this special coffee by a name like ""Bulletproof.""

Potential Side Effects and Who Should Be Cautious
-------------------------------------------------

Using coconut oil in coffee is okay for most people if they do not use too much. But it can cause some problems. The stomach problems I talked about are most common. Your stomach might hurt or you might have diarrhea if you use too much oil fast. This oil also has lots of saturated fat. People who have high cholesterol should be careful. People with heart problems should talk to a doctor first. This oil has many calories. If you eat too many calories total in a day, you will not lose weight.

Does Coconut Oil in Coffee *Actually* Help You Lose Weight? Understanding Calories and Fat Intake
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

People want to know if coconut oil in coffee really makes you lose weight. It is important to know the truth. Losing weight happens when you eat fewer calories than your body uses each day. This is called a calorie deficit. Coconut oil adds many calories and fat to your drink. If you add these calories and do not eat less food other times, your total calories go up. If total calories are higher, you will not lose weight. The type of fat does not change this rule about calories.

Does Coconut Oil in Coffee *Actually* Help You Lose Weight? It's Not a Magic Bullet: Diet and Exercise Still Matter
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Adding coconut oil to coffee is one thing you can add to your food plan. It is not a perfect answer for weight loss by itself. To lose weight and keep it off, you need to eat healthy food most of the time. Your food should have few processed things and many whole foods. You also need to move your body often. Do exercise. Coconut oil in coffee might help some people feel full. It might give them energy. But it will not make you thin if you do not eat healthy and move your body. It is a helper, not the main way to lose weight.

1l0nsu5,https://www.reddit.com/r/migraine/comments/1l0nsu5/after_10_years_of_migraines_i_went_from_20_days_a/,"After 10 Years of Migraines, I Went From 20 Days a Month to Just 5 — Here's Everything That Helped Me","Hi everyone,

I've been suffering from migraines since 2015, when I was 25. I'm 35 now, and I want to share how I went from 20 migraine days a month to about 5. Maybe this will help someone who’s still stuck in the nightmare I once lived.

🧨 The Worst Years It started with just 1–2 migraines a month, but by 2017–2019 I was getting them 20 days per month. I tried everything: beta blockers, Topamax, Aimovig... nothing worked.

My life was hell. I went to bed hoping I wouldn’t wake up. Work was nearly impossible—I almost got fired. The pain was 10/10 most weeks. I’d be so out of it I couldn’t even figure out how to take my Imitrex injection.

I truly don’t know how I made it through those years.

⚠️ Burnout & Rock Bottom Eventually, I crashed. I went to a doctor and got diagnosed with burnout. Years of stress and migraines had drained me completely. I couldn’t get out of bed anymore.

I took 3 months off work—honestly, I should’ve taken 6.

That time off gave me the space to start rebuilding. Slowly. One step at a time.

💡 What Helped Me Recover Here’s what helped me climb out of the pit. There’s no miracle cure—just a combination of small but powerful changes. Maybe not all of them will work for everyone, but these helped me tremendously.

1. 💉 Botox Injections After years of failed medications, I tried Botox. Total game-changer.

Migraine days dropped from 20 to about 12–15

Intensity dropped too — no more 10/10 attacks

I finally had breathing room to keep looking for other solutions.

2. 🚫 Triptan & Painkiller Detox (MOH) Before detoxing, I was using triptans about 10–12 days per month — way too much. I now realize I was dealing with medication overuse headaches (MOH).

I quit all painkillers and triptans cold turkey. It was absolute hell for 2 weeks (ice packs, pain, misery). But then — the daily migraines stopped.

I had my first pain-free week in years.

After 1 month, I cautiously reintroduced triptans, but never more than 8 per month.

3. 🚴 Light Daily Exercise I started small: biking to work (15 minutes each way). It wasn’t much, but it helped more than I expected.

4. 📚 Learning About Migraine I educated myself. Read 4 books. Two that changed things for me:

The Migraine Brain (English)

Migraine: Alles Wat Je Moet Weten (Dutch)

One quote from the Dutch book changed my perspective:

""Triggers are like water filling a bucket. Stress, bad sleep, alcohol—add water. Rest, sleep, good habits—remove water.

When the bucket overflows, you get a migraine.

The only way to make your bucket bigger? Exercise.""

5. 🥊 Serious Exercise: Weight Training, Kickboxing, Mountain Biking This was life-changing.

Weight training helped a bit, but when I added kickboxing and mountain biking, the real improvement began. Yes, I got some migraines after working out in the beginning, but my body adapted.

Now I aim for 3–5 hours of intense exercise per week.

Migraine days dropped to \~10/month

Max pain dropped to 8/10

Those horrible 10/10 ""middle of the night"" migraines? Gone

Bonus: I lost 10 kg (from 100 → 90) and gained muscle. If you’re overweight and struggling with chronic migraine — losing weight helps.

6. 🍽️ Food & Sleep Habits I’m not super strict, but I:

Eat mostly homecooked meals

Stick to a consistent sleep schedule

I eat lots of meat, nothing fancy, but avoiding processed food and keeping a routine makes a difference. Migraine brains love stability.

7. 🧘‍♂️ Reducing Triggers (Especially Stress) After a holiday in Brazil where I only had 2 migraine days in a whole month, I realized my job was destroying me.

I switched jobs. Still some stress, but less — and it brought me down to 8 days/month.

8. 🔄 Switch Doctors Until You Find the Right One Over the years I’ve seen 5 neurologists. Some were helpful, some weren’t.

If your doctor is just doing the bare minimum — change. Keep learning, keep pushing.

After years of Botox, my latest neurologist convinced me to try Ajovy. I was terrified, but it worked.

Migraine days went from 8 to 5/month

Still spikes in high-stress periods, but overall life is so much better now

🧩 Miscellaneous Things That Helped Some other small (but important) habits that helped along the way:

☕ Reduced caffeine intake: Now down to 1 cup of coffee max per day. I drink more tea instead.

💆‍♂️ Regular physical care: I see a kinesist, chiropractor, or get Thai massages regularly to keep my muscles relaxed.

🕒 Reduced work hours: I now work about 35 hours/week (90%). If you can’t do full-time, look for government/insurance programs that can help cover reduced hours.

🚫 Avoid bad days: If you wake up feeling off, don’t push yourself. Don’t go on that trip or force yourself to socialize. You’ll just end up miserable, stuck somewhere thinking: “Why did I do this?”

🧑‍💼 Changed work environments: I used to work at a small company where my absence hit the team hard. Now I’m at a larger firm, and missing a day isn’t a big deal. That matters.

💚 Be selfish sometimes: Do what’s best for you. If people don’t understand, that’s their problem. Don’t feel ashamed for taking care of yourself — even though I still struggle with this too sometimes.

❤️ Final Thoughts I hope this helps someone out there. I know how hopeless it can feel. But it is possible to get better.

You have to start, then keep going. No one else can save you — but you can. It takes effort, time, and persistence.

Just get that first win — then keep building.

Never give up. You're not alone. 💚💪

# TL;DR: 

I’ve had migraines since 2015. At my worst, I had 20 migraine days a month, constant 10/10 pain, burnout, and depression. Over 10 years, I reduced it to about 5 days per month by:

💉 Getting Botox, and later Ajovy

🚫 Quitting triptans and painkillers temporarely to stop medication overuse headaches

🥊 Doing 3–5 hours of intense exercise weekly (kickboxing, biking, weights)

📚 Educating myself (read The Migraine Brain, learned about trigger buckets)

🧘 Improving sleep, diet, routine, and reducing stress

🧩 Making lifestyle changes (cut caffeine, changed jobs, prioritized self-care)

It's not one quick fix, but a series of small steps that made a big difference. You can get better. It takes time and persistence — but it’s worth it. 💚💪",26,1748781000.0,migraine,4,1.0,False
1l0nsso,https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMySpaceAI/comments/1l0nsso/from_reddit_dilemma_to_dream_layout_ai_solves_a/,From Reddit Dilemma to Dream Layout: AI Solves a Large Bedroom Challenge,"Ever scrolled through Reddit forums like r/DesignMyRoom and seen a space that screams potential but is hampered by a tricky layout? We do! Recently, a post from user u/Anonymous_celery caught our eye: they were struggling with their large bedroom layout (from [r/DesignMyRoom post - struggling with my room layout](https://www.reddit.com/r/DesignMyRoom/comments/1l02bxq/struggling_with_my_room_layout/)).

We decided to take on the challenge using our AI Design Service to show how it can tackle real-world design problems.

# The Challenge: A Large Bedroom with Big Layout Problems

The original Reddit poster (u/Anonymous\_celery) was facing a frustrating bedroom layout dilemma: they had a large bedroom shared with their cats, but despite the generous space, they couldn't make it work functionally. As they put it: ""I have a large bedroom for me and my cats. But I don't know how to do the layout and I have a big empty space in the middle of the room.""

The specific issues they outlined were:

1. **No accessible bedside table** \- ""There is no space for the bedside table. bedside table is next to a dresser at the moment, not reachable when on the bed""
2. **No space for the cat crate** \- ""I have a cat crate, but there is no space, all the wall spaces are taken""
3. **Poor zoning** \- ""I wish to divide the space - working spot has the desk and the bookshelf, and sofas are gathered in one spot for friends to sit and chat, and bed and bedside table next to each other. At the moment it's all mixed.""
4. **Wasted space** \- Despite having a large room, there was a big empty space in the middle that wasn't being utilized effectively

Their plea was heartfelt: ""Please help, I'm really really struggling""

**The ""Before"" - Visualizing the Problem:**

*Image: A representation of the challenging bedroom layout described by the Reddit user - furniture scattered around walls, poor zoning, and that problematic empty space in the middle.*

# The AI-Powered Solution: Reimagining the Space

We took the core requirements from the Reddit post and fed them into our AI Design Service. The goal was to create a layout that was:

* **Functional:** Clearly defined zones for sleeping, working, and socializing.
* **Space-Efficient:** Making the most of the large bedroom while eliminating that wasted empty middle space.
* **Cat-Friendly:** Properly integrating space for the cat crate and cat needs.
* **Aesthetically Pleasing:** Creating a cohesive and inviting atmosphere with proper furniture placement.

Here's the layout our AI helped generate:

https://preview.redd.it/i22gmv1l7b4f1.jpg?width=1536&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c8e0030512f4b4f0f5baf70ece239ad918244b1f

*Image: The AI-designed bedroom layout, showcasing clear zones, improved flow, and thoughtful space utilization. Note the inclusion of a pet carrier, acknowledging the user's cats.*

**Key Design Choices in the AI-Generated Layout:**

* **Proper Sleeping Zone:** The bed is positioned with an accessible nightstand right beside it, solving the key issue of the bedside table being unreachable. The bed placement creates a defined sleeping area.
* **Dedicated Work Area:** The desk is positioned to create a focused workspace, separate from the sleeping and social areas, addressing the user's desire for distinct zones.
* **Social/Living Zone:** The sofa and coffee table create a clear area for friends to gather and chat, fulfilling the user's wish for a dedicated social space.
* **Smart Storage Solutions:** The wardrobe provides essential storage while helping to define different zones within the large room.
* **Cat-Friendly Integration:** The visible pet carrier shows how cat furniture can be naturally integrated into the design without taking up valuable wall space.
* **Eliminated Wasted Space:** The arrangement fills the previously empty middle area with functional furniture placement that improves flow rather than creating dead space.
* **Clear Traffic Patterns:** The layout allows for easy movement between zones while maintaining their distinct purposes.

Just a heads up English is not my first language so I apologize for any mistakes. Also there are some gruesome stuff in this story so please read at your own risk. This story has been on my mind for a while but has no confidence to tell but something happen which give me the boost to finally tell drama in our small community so grab your coffee grab cat this will be a very long ride.

This all started 2 generations ago, my maternal grandparents bought a land to build a house for their family of 4 (2 daughters). Because they lost their previous property to a land grabber because my maternal grandfather doesn’t want to fight for it. So, they found another property close to my grand aunt (maternal grandma’s sister) place. Everything was fine and dandy until a difficult neighbor enters the scene, they were a large family of 12 and started to make trouble to my grandparents. From what my mother told me the neighbor’s familymatriarch claimed the land (lot 1) as theirs and these also included the vacant lot, our and the few lots next to our basically most of our entire block. And get this they do not have the papers to support their claim. To give a visual:

https://preview.redd.it/8sixt7xa2b4f1.jpg?width=720&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a1dd1227243f0330ae6d6c82e471537fda2cab79

  
They wanted my family out of “Their Property”, the conflicts was very frequent but fortunately a family friend became the mayor of our Municipality and they helped us and others to finally have the legal papers needed to back up the claim to our land. (Side note: These events started during the 80’s and I am from the Philippines so messy land/property conflicts is very “brutally” common) My maternal grandparents hated them and it might be to the point that they do not want any association with them. And if you think that our family drama is done here comes the plot twist my aunt (Mother’s elder sister) SECRETLY married (civil wedding) a son from the difficult neighbor and by the time my grandparents knew it was too late. My aunt’s husband was 10 years older than her and they got married when she was 18 years old. From what I’ve heard it was the classic me and you against the world. My grandparents were horrified not only because who she married and her age but because my grandfather was a traditional catholic and only church weddings was the true wedding. So,they were force/coerced to do a church wedding with in few weeks (I think) and few months to year later my aunt and uncle had their son. And finally, all is well……. Wrong if you think a marriage will bring the long-awaited peace let me give you some neighborly drama. My aunt had difficulty in dealing with one of her sisters in law, I think amongst her in laws she was the most nasty one others were quite civil and nice. I’m going to call her Unlucky (Trust me these will make sense later). Unlucky was very rude to my aunt saying that she is not part of the family. She was also the most ungrateful one, Unlucky often makes trouble for herself and its always my uncle and aunt that had to clean up her mess. This including begging my mother not to press charges when Unlucky and her husband planted trees at night in our backyard my mother had just given birth to our youngest via cesarean section and went to confront Unlucky after pulling the planted tree seedlings and the same lame reason was given they denied the allegation and saying they owned that place and were just illegal tenants (Side note: My mother cut herself for pulling the seedlings). By this time, we already paid for the property and all of its taxes. The next one is the tree incident, prior to building our house there were already two fruit trees planted there before anybody moved in the property and it was located in the middle of our lot and the vacant lot every year the trees will bear a lot of fruits. One day my father was in the middle of taking a few when Unlucky spotted him and was criticized stating that he has no rights to take fruits from a tree that was in the middle of our property and the vacant lot because she owned it and she was the one who plated it. Again, the trees were already there before anybody moved in and it was planted by the original owner and it was located to far from her property. Few years later after difficult neighbor’s Patriarch died my aunts in laws moved out (including Unlucky) and started to build their careers and family. A lot of them got married but not everyone is as lucky as my aunt’s husband in terms of career and marriage.

 By 2015, 2 of the 10 siblings died and few separated from their spouses. Unlucky was really unlucky she got a husband that really matched her energy, anyone who was dumb enough to trust them will face losses. That is why they came back here because according to the ones who know (my aunt) they were running away from debts and lawsuits. And if you think they already learned their lesson and will keep quite No! they went back to their old scheme scamming people of their money. Unlucky’s husband was just as unlucky as her mixing with the wrong powerful people (Politicians allegedly) and got himself assassinated, he was shot while driving a motorcycle and they blamed the rebels for it. No investigation was made and the case was close before it was opened. Unlucky had married again a year after the passing of her husband and they build a new house across her parent’s house they were only separated by the main road. Quick background of that property my father said it was stolen by Unlucky from her relatives my mother also said that a lot of Unlucky’s aunt cried because of the betrayal she did. Also she sold properties that belonged to her cousins without their knowledge. Pass forward to 2022 the difficult neighbor’s matriarch died, a motorcycle crashed into her while she was sweeping leaves on the street near her house, she was around late 70’s. and the driver was drunk. My parents and Aunt were part of the church’s ministers so they will conduct prayer vigils for every dead members of the church. My mother begged my father to join and offer prayers because it was her sister’s in laws my Father didn’t want to at first because if the humiliation anf false accusations he suffered from them but was persuaded so he went reluctantly. The matriarch had only few living siblings left and most of them also hates her so they did not attend the funeral only few relatives came including 2 nieces and no neighbors wants to come. Although her children were there but the vigil is almost empty, it’s almost like no one liked her. Although I am civil with that old woman I did not go because I was working in another city and my father did not want me to attend neither were my siblings. Now here comes another tragedy, Unlucky had 2 children the eldest was female and the youngest was male. Her daughter was a lot like her,rude, condescending and very unrespectful my aunt’s husband their uncle was almost always the recipient of their outburst. The culture here in the Philippines is you must respect on your elders specially the ones who helped your family the most. In this case my Aunt’s husband which is their uncle. But it seems their still envious and ungrateful. 

Now last night around 7pm fire engulfed their house. What happened was Unlucky’s two children had a fight and this one had bothered their stepfather and had an outburst of anger. But prior to these the Unlucky’s daughter had been very disrespectful to their stepfather always berating him like she owns the place. But the truth is their stepfather was the one who built and paid for the majority of that house including the utilities. The Stepfather doused their motorcycle that was used for his job with gasoline and lit it with fire. The youngest son dragged the burning motorcycle out of the garage and asked his nephew (eldest daughter’s son) to go and call one of their uncles to try to calm their Stepfather which lived not far from them. The stepfather became more irate and seems to be not himself anymore he went inside got a bolo and taunted everyone present. One of their family friend saw what happened and went to persuade the stepfather to drop the bolo and to talk but it fell on deaf ears the uncle came but it was no avail no one could get close. And then he went inside and doused Unlucky’s and his room with gasoline and lit it one fire and since the house was mostly made of light materials the fire spread fast. The stepfather wanted to drag Unlucky inside but was unsuccessful so he went inside alone and …… you know the rest. His body was found near the kitchen sink after the fire department stopped the fire and did a sweep of the place. The information I just shared was mostly from my aunt and the people who was there before the fire I just saw the fire because it was really close to our house fortunately far enough from the fire. If you think the drama ended there you are sadly mistaken, someone started the fire and the who started it died. In our community almost nobody liked them and the few who have relationship with them are kind relatives. And those relatives lived across our house and by morning loud crying and blaming was heard meanwhile my mother was drinking tea and listening to the tea with slight grin on her face (I saw it). In the afternoon my aunt came and spilled more tea turns out the eldest daughter was the instigator of the fight and when they asked my aunt and her husband if they could sleep in their house my aunt said NO! And they proceeded to look for other place. 

Now did they deserve what happened to them? I think not but others might say yes, they deserve it. I do not know how many hated them and the full extent of what they’ve done so I can’t say for certain that they deserve it. But what do you think?",1,1748780916.0,CharlotteDobreYouTube,0,1.0,False

1l0nqdg,https://www.reddit.com/r/VitaPiracy/comments/1l0nqdg/i_cant_wait_anymore_my_vita/,I can’t wait anymore… my vita..,"
Day five. Only day five. And already, I feel as though I have aged a thousand years.

I lie awake each night with a single, pulsing thought echoing in my skull: where is my PS Vita? The days stretch before me like barren deserts, endless and punishing. I have counted every hour. Every minute. Every torturous second that drips from the clock like molasses over burning skin. I have stared into the face of time itself—and it has stared back, unblinking, merciless.

My desk is no longer a place of productivity. It is a shrine to absence. A cruel museum of what I do not yet have. There, in a neat little cluster, sit the accessories: the case, pristine and empty, like a coffin waiting for its corpse. The clear shell casing, useless in its clarity, like a ghost that cannot find its body. The screen protector, sealed in its sterile packaging, untouched by fingerprints or joy. The adapter, a lifeline to a world I cannot yet enter. And the keychains—mocking me with their cheerful jingling, their Vita-shaped silhouettes dancing on a chain as if to say, “We are ready. Where is your soul?”

Where is my soul indeed? Lost somewhere between the tracking updates and the void. A void named “two-week shipping.” A void in which hope goes to die.

Every morning I wake, momentarily forgetting the ache. And then I see it: the case. Sitting on my dresser like a dead-eyed sentinel, its zipper grinning at me like the jaws of fate. It is a daily reminder, a cruel echo of what could be—what should be—but is not.

And so, I turn to YouTube. My only solace, my virtual temple. There, I watch others cradle their Vitas with the reverence of monks. They unbox them slowly, peeling back the lid like it’s holy scripture. Their hands touch the buttons—my buttons. They flip through the menus—my menus. They live the life I was meant to lead. And I am left to watch, face bathed in the cold glow of a screen that only reflects my pain back at me. Each video is a blade. A sweet, glistening blade of joy that cuts deep into my longing.

I watch gameplay footage with the intensity of a starving man watching a feast. “Look,” I whisper to myself, delirious, “it runs Persona 4 Golden so smoothly.” My reflection in the screen is hollow-eyed and pale, like a ghost tethered to reality by sheer force of obsession. I reach out to touch the screen protector, and for a moment—just a moment—I pretend it’s real. But it’s not. It’s just plastic. Just anticipation wrapped in cellophane.

People say waiting builds character. Those people are fools.

This is no ordinary waiting. This is not the slight irritation of standing in line at a coffee shop. This is not the idle fidgeting of waiting for a bus. This is warfare. Psychological torture. This is staring down the yawning chasm of “estimated delivery date: 2 weeks” and feeling your sanity unravel like cheap yarn in a cat’s claws.

The worst part? The accessories are ready. They are here. Every fiber of their being longs to serve. The case craves its purpose, gaping like an open wound. The adapter’s plug thirsts for power. The screen protector waits like an anxious soldier in the trenches. They whisper to me at night.

“Soon,” they say.
“Not soon enough,” I reply.

There is no comfort. There is no escape. I can go for walks. I can touch grass. I can speak to loved ones, eat meals, exist within the illusion of a functioning human being. But it’s all a lie. Beneath the surface, I am breaking. I stare at others walking freely, laughing, breathing—do they not know what it’s like to live without a PS Vita when you’ve already bought the accessories?

They say anticipation makes the reward sweeter. I say it makes the present unlivable. I am a husk of a man, hollowed out by dreams of remote play and custom firmware. I am the ghost of a gamer, haunting his own home, rattling keychains like chains, waiting for a delivery truck that never comes.

My tracking number hasn’t updated in days. That’s the part that eats me alive the most. It’s out there—somewhere. Maybe it’s sitting in a sorting facility. Maybe it’s on a truck. Maybe it fell between universes and is now in a dimension where everyone has a Vita and no one knows what it means to wait. That world is heaven. This one is hell.

I have memorized the measurements of the device. I’ve read reviews until the words lost all meaning. I’ve planned what I’ll play first—though that list changes hourly. I’ve rehearsed the unboxing in my head more times than I can count. I’ve even selected the perfect spot on my shelf, where the Vita will rest when not in use. That spot is empty now. Just like me.

If there is a god, they are laughing. “Let them suffer,” they say, as I refresh the shipping page one more time. No update. Just the same, mocking line: “Expected in 9 more days.”

Nine more days.
I cannot endure nine more days.

I am become despair, destroyer of joy. My friends ask how I’m doing. I lie to them. I smile and say, “I’m good.” But inside, I am crumbling. I am screaming. I am reaching across space and time for a device that dares not arrive.

There is no end. Only waiting.

And yet… when it finally comes, when the package is finally in my hands, when the bubble wrap parts and I lift it free—then, and only then, will the clouds part. The sun will rise anew. Music will play from the heavens. And I will know peace, perhaps for the first time.

But until that moment, I exist in purgatory. Between the order and the unboxing. Between hope and despair. Between the empty case—and the life it was made to carry.

We both graduated university a year ago, where we studied the same course. We live relatively near each other so since coming out we ended up hanging out quite a bit. During uni we would always go to the library to get assignments done etc with others in our friendship group, sometimes alone, so once we came out of uni we carried the same dynamic. We would link up and get work done, either in the local library / coffee shops etc, or we would just chill / talk/ hang. we did this for the whole of summer.

During the summer till the end of the year, we would talk a good few times a week, after that it became everyday. He runs a business and so do I, but he was a large reason as to why I wanted to take my business full time, as he encouraged me but also for the fact that I was able to see a real life example of being an entrepreneur (most of my friends are going corporate). But anyways, basically we now speak everyday, sometimes I catch him looking at me, but nothing crazy I don’t think. When I did used to speak to guys, I can’t tell if he either didn’t like it, or he’s just interested in the topic of talking about boys, since he is a boy 😂. If he called and I didn’t answer he’d be like “oh, it was your boyfriend” but emphasis on the boyfriend, kinda felt like jealousy but might be a reach. There was a time I didn’t pick up all day, he called a few times, and then had to basically sit me down and tell me how we are very very close, and that If I’m gonna go awall like that I should just let him know.

On the side we also do business together, so it does play a large part to our communication but tbh only half the time as we don’t do business every month. I know quite a lot about his life now, and this sticks out to me cause he once told me if a boy is telling you stuff about his private life then he obviously likes you etc. sorry guys I’m just trying to spit out facts so I don’t type too much😩 in the past I had a friend who when I was grieving a talking stage used it as opportunity to make his move, which I didn’t appreciate , and I expressed this to him. So I feel like even if he did like me, maybe he wouldn’t act on it? And I’ve also expressed to him how I need to know someone for timeee before I can really get to that stage and like someone, quick romances cringe me and I can’t take them serious 🤣 we’ve also had conversations about what we would want in a partner and in terms of lifestyle he does know that he fits it, but so do a lot of people I know 🤣 we both do still show interest in other people and stuff so in my head I’m thinking this is my brother, but at the same time, the treatment is messing with my head. I do have other male friends who i see as strictly platonic, like brothers to me, but this dynamic just feels different.

He’s not even my type, but he is an attractive person but I’m more attracted to the way he is and his outlook and action on life, if that makes sense. and I don’t know whether I am to him, I feel like I could be, since one girl he liked the look of kind of looks like me, but he doesn’t have a type at all, just an aesthetic I’d say.

1l0nmfo,https://www.reddit.com/r/jobs/comments/1l0nmfo/ive_hit_the_wall_but_stuck_here/,"I’ve hit the wall, & but stuck here","I’ve worked at a lot of start-ups. I’ve seen the ups and downs, but this is different. We have a good thing going, but we have some toxicity that trickles down. We’ve had layoffs, as any place does - but when there’s a real problem, they’d rather stick their head in the ground, and ignore it. Hoping it goes away on their own. 

We have one team, that’s combusting due to the bosses ignoring the problem(one drama queen that takes everything has a personal attack, from not getting a job they wanted - only to drive the person who got it, from the company), to not having the soda or coffee creamer they like. And then there’s me, I was hired to be the executive assistant to the CEO, and HELP OCCASIONALLY with office management duties, while they search for a new office manager or maybe I can help them relearn the job, since I did that before. I was told I would have help - the office manager/event planner & another administrative assistant. 

Then my first day on the job, I’m told the office manager has had cancer for YEARS, and she’s horrible at her job. Things I wish I knew, from the jump off. And the admin, was about to be moved into procurement. They just wanted to do the same thing over and over again, and they have panic attacks when forced to step out of their boundaries.  So basically, it’s just me.

The first year was BRUTAL. I was miserable. Between the OM screaming at me, and taking everything out on me, to me running around constantly, I don’t know how I made it. 

Everyone here, is appreciative of what I do. They better be, I do everything expect wipe their ass. But here’s the thing, I’m in my late 40’s. We have four offices, I need to run around, and make sure is stocked. I have a CEO, who’s flitting about, and preoccupied with funding(which is obviously VERY IMPORTANT- I’m not that dumb), and thinks the fact we stopped getting mangos is why people are unhappy. 

While I have employees making EXTREMELY out of pocket jokes(re: which I’ve personally dealt with, they don’t know), and an executive, who shoe horned himself into a conversation - with myself & another female - to tell us about a documentary he watched, regarding a slave, that was used strictly for sexual purposes. To make bigger, & stronger slaves. For the record, the other woman and I were talking about horses, and dressage. And if I say something, I feel like I’m going to be the asshole -  because the exec? Is the #2 in the office. 

I’m making decent money, I’m a single woman, I have no kids(thank Christ), I have a roof over my head, but I feel like I’m stuck. I’m so shredded at the end of the week, my weekends are spent on the couch. I can’t focus for shit. I know I’m depressed(/perimenopausal sorry for the TMI) but I haven’t been this bad in YEARS, and I can’t concentrate on anything, because I’m putting out every fire - the lines between office management & operations are being blurred, and everything is being put on to me. 

I plan, setup, cleanup (at least)eight lunches a week(ranging in sizes from 10 people to 150 people), stocking 10 fridges with drinks and food, fixing a coffee machine that never works - while trying to find a new coffee vendor. Occasionally getting swag made because Marketing left us with nothing, Chasing people down for signatures, working with legal to make sure everything is on the up and up for contracts, getting all office supplies for all locations, calendaring for a CEO I need to micromanage, setting up events(from company events to board meetings), travel arrangements, being a shrink for people, the list goes on and on…

I’m getting emotional typing this out, and I feel like an asshole, because I know there are some of you, who would kill to have this problem, versus the shit you put up with ie looking for a job/unemployement. But I’m trapped. I try to look for something else, but no one is paying. I was honest to HR this week. She knows I’m unhappy, and even admits I’m doing too much(she asked if I was looking, but she knows the market sucks). I can’t relax at home, I’m overwhelmed even here - because my place is a mess, and I have no desire to organize my own place, because I’ve spent five days doing it for eight hours there. 

And I’m about to start planning another holiday party, and I already have operations bitching at me about how I haven’t picked a location yet. I know at startups, you wear many hats - but it’s never been this bad before. 

I’m sorry for the verbal diarrhea, I just don’t know what else to do(yes, I see a shrink, and no, I don’t have the money to go back to school or a bullshit job coach). Please tell me I’m not the only one, stuck right now?",2,1748780456.0,jobs,1,0.75,False

Paul Blart had returned to New Jersey, but normal life didn’t quite fit the same anymore. Sure, the West Orange Pavilion Mall still had rogue hoverboard teens and Auntie Anne’s emergencies, but after battling shadow monsters and Russians with portable flamethrowers, nothing could shake that *itch* in the back of his brain.

Then came the envelope. No return address. Inside: a photo of Hawkins Lab rebuilt, active… and glowing red. A note was paper-clipped to the back:

**“They’re back. And they’re not alone.”**  
*D.H.*

“D.H.? Dustin Henderson?” Paul said aloud. “Or... Die Hard?”

Either way, Paul loaded up the Segway, taped extra batteries to his chest, and took the first bus to Indiana.

**Back in Hawkins**

The town looked fine on the surface. But Paul noticed things. A flicker in people’s eyes. A strange hum in the air. And then there were the agents.

Men in black suits were all over town real shady types who wore sunglasses indoors and ordered coffee like it was an interrogation.

It didn’t take long before Paul was reunited with the gang. Dustin, Mike, Lucas, Max, and a power-restored Eleven were now full-blown Upside Down veterans, operating out of the basement of the rebuilt Radio Shack (owned by a mysteriously absent Mr. Clarke). Steve, Robin, and Nancy had uncovered something even worse than Russian spies: a U.S. military faction using leftover gate energy to create something new controlled creatures.

“They're calling it Project Red Ice,” Nancy explained, pointing to a map covered in strings, sticky notes, and way too many photos of frozen cornfields. “They’re trying to *weaponize* the Upside Down.”

“And it's spreading under Hawkins again,” added Eleven. “Only this time, it listens.”

Paul squinted. “Wait… you’re saying the military has a *tame* Demogorgon?”

Robin shook her head. “Not tame. *Programmed.* They’re making an army.”

**Operation: Mall Cop Protocol**

Paul didn’t like it. In fact, he hadn’t liked anything since the ice started forming on Hawkins Lake in the middle of July. He took charge.

“I’ll cause a distraction. You kids sneak in through the tunnels.”

“What distraction?” asked Lucas.

Paul zipped his jacket, strapped on elbow pads, and pulled down his aviator sunglasses. “The only one I know how to do.”

**At the gates of Hawkins Lab…**

Sirens blared. Guards ran in every direction. And through the fog rolled… Paul Blart. His Segway was reinforced with kitchen baking sheets, a leaf blower engine, and what appeared to be a blender filled with glitter.

He was *unstoppable*.

“YOU CAN'T SILENCE SECURITY!” he yelled as he launched frozen pretzels like grenades.

Inside, the gang made their way to the holding chamber. There, in a cryo-pod, stood the *Alpha Demogorgon*  larger, armored, its eyes glowing red with synthetic rage.

Paul burst in just as the creature broke free. Military agents fled. The lights flickered.

Paul stared it down. “Not in *my* jurisdiction, Fluffy.”

The creature roared.

Paul reached into his fanny pack… and pulled out a walkie-talkie.

“Eleven, now!”

BOOM. An explosion rocked the east wing. Eleven pushed herself to the limit, sealing the lab in a swirl of telekinetic force as the Demogorgon screamed and disintegrated into ash this time, for good.

**Epilogue**

The government covered it up. Again.

Blart was offered a “deep state medal of mall-level excellence,” which he politely declined. Instead, he opened a private security agency called **""Blart Watch""**, based in Hawkins  just in case.

The others went back to being teenagers… mostly.

But every now and then, when the lights flickered, or a cold wind blew in from the wrong direction, Paul Blart would grip his Segway’s handlebars just a little tighter.

Because evil never sleeps.

Daily tension headaches

Heart palpitations + worse with coffee

Dizziness, lightheadedness, feeling faint on exertion.

Do you think that means I’m symptomatic or could it be something else? Anything i can do short of surgery. Doctors don’t seem concerned about it

I disassembled the grinder wheel, vacuumed it, disassembled the lower wheel, vacuumed it, brushed it with the brush and reassembled it. Since reassembling, the coffee grind remains thick, even when set to the finest setting. What's the problem? Did I wind it wrong? I reassembled everything again, sucked in and watched videos. Nothing changes. The grind is still too thick. The grind quantity setting seems to have been changed ... it gives me a lot of coffee quickly. Too much ",0,1748779920.0,BrevilleCoffee,4,0.5,False
