You know how it is – you get a seemingly straightforward request, and then it snowballs into an avalanche of conflicting priorities, each demanding your immediate, undivided attention. That was me, last quarter, trying to launch a new reporting tool.

Our users, bless their hearts, were practically begging for more granular data exports and custom dashboards. They painted vivid pictures of how this would transform their workflows, eyes sparkling with anticipation. On the other side of the ring, my engineering team, those wizards of code, looked at the specs and just... sighed. 'Months,' they'd say, 'and it'll delay every other critical bug fix and stability improvement we have lined up.' You could almost feel the weight of their current sprint commitments pressing down on them.

And then, *then* there was the business side. My boss, with the best intentions, had already pitched this 'revolutionary' reporting feature to a major potential client, promising it by the end of Q3. The pressure was immense. I was stuck in the middle, feeling like a human juggling act, trying to catch flaming chainsaws of user desire, engineering reality, and executive expectations all at once. My calendar was a graveyard of back-to-back meetings, each one a battleground for resources and deadlines.

The breakthrough finally came after a particularly brutal whiteboard session, fueled by cold coffee and sheer desperation. We decided to slice the 'revolutionary' feature into an MVP that solved the immediate, highest-impact pain point for our users, promising the more complex parts in later iterations. It wasn't perfect, but it shipped, and everyone (mostly) lived to tell the tale. The relief when that first version went live was palpable, like shedding a 50-pound backpack.

Seriously, though, has anyone else ever felt like they needed a degree in diplomacy just to survive a feature launch? How do you guys handle those situations where everyone wants a piece of the pie, but the oven's only big enough for a crumb?",1,1770922030.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

Been working in the sports media industry for about 4 years now…first at a major vendor, now at a startup. I am absolutely burnt out. It's brutal hours for honestly pretty mediocre pay.

1r31nce,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1r31nce/how_to_tell_if_someone_is_into_you_the_psychology/,How to Tell if Someone is Into You: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I used to be terrible at reading signals. Like, genuinely awful. Someone could practically wear a neon sign saying ""I LIKE YOU"" and I'd convince myself they were just being polite. Turns out, I'm not alone in this. After diving deep into research on attraction, body language studies, and behavioral psychology, I've realized most of us miss obvious signs because we're either too anxious, overthinking, or just unaware of what to look for.

Here's what actually matters, backed by science and real human behavior patterns:

**They remember the small stuff**

When someone likes you, their brain literally prioritizes information about you. This isn't just cute, it's neuroscience. The ventral tegmental area (part of the brain's reward system) lights up when we're attracted to someone, making us hyper-attentive to details about them.

They'll remember you mentioned loving a specific coffee order three weeks ago. They'll bring up that random story about your childhood dog. They're not just being polite, their brain is cataloging YOU because you matter to them.

**The ""lean in"" thing is real**

Body language researchers have found that we unconsciously orient our bodies toward people we're interested in. It's called proxemics, the study of personal space.

If someone consistently leans toward you during conversations, angles their body in your direction even in group settings, or finds reasons to be physically closer, that's a green light. Dr. Monica Moore's research at Webster University found that proximity-seeking behavior is one of the most reliable indicators of romantic interest.

**They laugh at your mediocre jokes**

Not because you're secretly a comedy genius, but because laughter releases oxytocin and creates bonding. A study published in Evolutionary Psychology found that people laugh significantly more around those they're attracted to, even when the humor is objectively not that funny.

If they're giggling at your terrible puns or finding your awkward moments endearing rather than cringe, pay attention.

**The texting pattern tells you everything**

Here's what I learned from reading ""Dataclysm"" by Christian Rudder (OkCupid's cofounder who analyzed millions of interactions). People who are interested respond faster, match your text length, and ask follow up questions. They're not playing games with response times or giving you one word answers.

This book is insanely good at breaking down what people actually do versus what they say. It uses real data from dating platforms to show you the truth about human attraction. Changed how I view digital communication completely.

**They find excuses to touch you**

Touch is powerful. Even brief, ""accidental"" contact on the arm or shoulder releases oxytocin and builds connection. Research from DePauw University found that appropriate touch during conversation increases positive feelings and perceived closeness.

Light touches on your arm during conversation, adjusting your collar, playful shoulder bumps. These aren't accidents. They're testing boundaries and creating intimacy.

**They mirror your energy and movements**

Mirroring is subconscious mimicry and it's a massive indicator of interest. The Chameleon Effect research by Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh at NYU showed that we unconsciously copy the behaviors of people we like or want to connect with.

They'll match your speaking pace, adopt similar postures, even start using phrases you use. It's their brain trying to create rapport and connection without them even realizing it.

For understanding the psychology behind all this, ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) is phenomenal. It breaks down the science of influence and attraction in super practical ways. Schafer spent years studying how to get people to like and trust him for interrogations, and he applies those same principles to everyday relationships. Best book on reading people I've encountered.

Also check out Vanessa Van Edwards' YouTube channel. Her videos on body language and social cues are research backed and actually useful, not the typical ""how to manipulate people"" garbage. She breaks down real studies and shows you what to look for in actual interactions.

Another resource worth checking out is BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by former Google engineers that pulls from psychology books, dating research, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on your specific goals. Say you want to ""read attraction signals better as an overthinker,"" it generates a learning plan just for you, drawing from sources like the books mentioned above plus behavioral science papers and real relationship experts. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology way easier to absorb during your commute or at the gym.

And honestly, the app Finch helped me build better self awareness around my own social anxiety and overthinking patterns. It's a self care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it genuinely helped me recognize when I was spiraling into ""they definitely don't like me"" mode for no reason.

The thing is, most people aren't as hard to read as we think. We're just scared of being wrong, of misreading situations, of making things awkward. But attraction leaves breadcrumbs. Biology makes sure of that. Our brains are hardwired to signal interest, even when we're trying to play it cool.

Just wondering if others had a similar issue with previous pregnancies and whether they were able to have adequate stores built up over the remainder of the pregnancy? I'm worried that now that it's low, I won't have time to build up iron stores quickly enough before the iron demand during pregnancy ramps up.

1r31k4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1r31k4a/hr_the_art_of_saying_hello/,[HR] The Art of Saying Hello,"The scent of freshly varnished wood gave the bar new life. He sipped his cold amber pale ale, letting the bitter, woody liquid coat his taste buds. Chic shelves, polished leather chairs, and dim low-hanging lamps surrounded him — Fridays here were for decompressing. Work, life, family, ambition: everyone carried their own weight. Some found release in meditation, some in company. He found it in solitude.

The bar itself was a converted two-story colonial house, its age disguised beneath new varnish and quiet jazz. Once, this very room had likely been a living room — generations of families must have gathered here before, their laughter now replaced by the soft clinking of glasses. In the next room, past the old archway, was a small coffee bar and the narrow hallway to the restroom. Few people came here anymore.

Outside, the 5 o’clock sun cast long shadows across the sea. The old lighthouse — a weathered monument on the horizon — stood watch over the coast, enriching the view with its quiet legacy. Stress, responsibility, the endless rush of modern life — so easily one could get caught in it. But he didn’t. He breathed in the salt air, listened to the waves, and watched the quiet songs of the world. Sometimes, the only choice was to focus on the now.

His mind wandered and eyes glazed when he spotted someone at the other end of the bar — a familiar shape, like an old photograph with edges blurred. Should he say hello? Nod? Pretend he hadn’t seen them at all? He wasn’t sure if it was really his acquaintance.

The cold, sweating glass of ale looked equally puzzled as he tried to gather his thoughts. Would it be rude to speak? The possible acquaintance sat alone, scrolling through their phone, surely not wanting an interruption. How could he disrupt another’s peace?

He took a slow sip. Think. Decide.

A nod might be appropriate, he thought. A nod was both a greeting and non-committal enough to not pressure a response. The ‘hello’ of non-verbal communication — non-offensive, all-purpose, innocuous. Yet, if the stranger was actually an acquaintance, maybe a nod would be perceived as dismissive.

Maybe a small smile with the nod? Too eager. Too casual. Too uncertain. He shifted in his chair, letting the cold glass sweat through his fingers. If he pretended not to see them, would that be safer? Would they notice? Would they think he was rude, or worse — forgetful?

A nod seemed out of the question. He wondered if a verbal greeting would work. “Hey” was a strong contender — simple, friendly, inviting but respectful of their space. “Hi” was another option — short, universal, not overly eager. “Good evening” — formal enough if they were strangers, but friendly enough to be warm.

Sipping her drink, the stranger chuckled at her phone.

There was also the question of timing. When should he say hello, if he did at all? The stranger hadn’t looked up for the last few minutes. An abrupt greeting would come off as brash — even if she had been an acquaintance. Should he wait until she looked up? That would be weird and require him to spend a certain amount of time vaguely looking in her direction to time it right. Too early, and he risked missing it. Too late, and the moment would be gone forever. A greeting wasn’t something you could redo.

Draft beer poured out of the tap as he nodded for a refill.

Whether the stranger was, in fact, a stranger, played through his mind. An acquaintance could do well with a “hi.” A stranger was better suited to a nod. Tone also mattered. Too loud could come off as brash if they didn’t know each other; too quiet risked giving the impression he didn’t remember her face.

How did one deal with misremembering a person? Not being sure of their status made the situation even more precarious. Surely, if they came up to you, you’d acknowledge them, then ask vague questions about how they’ve been and search for clues about who they are. But being the asker was different. There was art to it, especially if you were uncertain whether you knew each other. To disturb their peace risked a bad impression — or worse.

He shifted his weight in his chair and leaned back.

The sun was starting to set as he fiddled with his glass. The passage of time waits for no man, yet he remained in his seat, wondering what to do. The longer he delayed, the greater the risk. If the stranger was an acquaintance, the hesitation could be perceived as standoffish. If the stranger was, in fact, a stranger, he could seem anti-social. None of these outcomes seemed positive, yet he still had no clue who this person was.

Was it a colleague? He’d always had a bad memory for faces, especially at work. He made a habit of keeping every business card he ever received, carefully storing them for situations like these. Was it one of his wife’s friends? The stranger seemed about his wife’s age and did seem familiar. This compounded in his brain.

Her short, sharp laugh — a sound he usually associated with the kitchen and his wife’s stories about work — flickered a connection. Yes. It was his wife’s friend, the one named… What was her name?

He fidgeted with his glass.

Realizing this, he resolved to greet her. The nod was too distant, too harsh. A hello was the only option. Yet, a hello said in a vacuum would be too artificial. He needed a wave. But what sort of wave? A simple hand raise? One with movement? Or a salute of sorts? Each had its advantages, but none struck the tone he wanted to set.

The sun, barely visible, cast a fading shadow over the lighthouse.

There was the option of going up to say hello, but that posed its own risks. Would he interrupt while she was busy? Would it come off as a surprise and startle her? Would it seem presumptuous to intrude on her corner of the empty bar? Whatever option he chose, he had to do so soon.

Another sip.

He imagined what would happen if he said hello and it wasn’t her. She’d give him that look — the one strangers give when they’re forced into unwanted small talk. Then he’d have to explain himself. There was no dignified way to recover from that.

Mustering up the courage, he decided: a hello, a simple hand raise, a slight smile, a nod. He would time it when the bartender returned from the back, so he could pass it off as asking for another beer if he missed his cue.

He waited.

Filled with resolve, three minutes passed. No bartender. Only the sound of the faint evening breeze.

His forehead began to bead with sweat as he fiddled with his half-empty glass. He couldn’t wave with a greasy face. He’d look unkempt, ragged. That was not an option. He adjusted in his seat and stood to go to the bathroom.

Step by step, he debated. The nod would work well, but would it work with the hand raise? The “hello” would work if she were a stranger, but she was an acquaintance. A “hi” was ideal.

Looking into the mirror as he washed his face, suds clinging to his five o’clock shadow, he saw determination.

His shoes made a slight thud with each step back. As he got closer, it seemed to grow louder — thump, thump, thump. His heart beat to the sound.

Approaching the main room, he straightened his shoulders, his determination solidified.

The acquaintance had gone.

The seat where she had sat was empty. The only sound was the faint rinse of her glass in the sink. The bar had returned to silence.

He sat back down, his freshened face cooling in the evening air. The lighthouse blinked once, then again. Alone, he lifted his glass and took another sip.

“Hello,” he murmured to the empty stool.        ",1,1770921552.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Had a 13 mm and a 9mm kidney stone. Had laser lithotripsy and then a stent for 10 days. Intermittent good and bad days with the stent. Had one night of what I think was actively passing a painful fragment. Stent hopefully comes out tomorrow.

That’s the gist - what follows is the full narrative. I hope it helps someone understand their own situation. 

**History** 

About 10-12 years ago I had a 9mm stone that was treated with external shockwave lithotripsy (ESWL) that was followed up with whatever the procedure was called when they still have to go in and remove the remaining fragments (I just called it “the claw”). I remember the whole process taking a long time (couple of months I think) and the extended time with the stent until after “The Claw” was more painful than any of the pre-procedure pain from the stones. I never did have to pass a stone of significant size (lots of “gravel” though) that time - so other than the “big stone ache” the stent was the worst part of the experience. 

I should also note that I have a fairly high pain tolerance. I never thought so, but my wife tells me things that I shrug off would have her in severe pain so I’ll take her word for it. 

**Symptoms and Diagnosis**

About 12 months ago I noticed some intermittent but recurring pain in my left flank that would occasionally radiate to my left testicle. It was less severe than that original stone—and would go away after a day or so—so just chalked it up to being sore from the gym. 

Fast forward to about January 7th (a little over a month ago) and that week the pain was persistent and radiating continuously to my testicle. I had a chiropractor appointment for Friday and told myself if the adjustment didn’t affect the symptoms then I’d get checked for a kidney stone. 

(As an aside, I hadn’t told my wife about the symptoms until we were in the chiros office together. So she was mad at me for a few days!). 

Needless to say, given the sub I’m posting on, the chiropractor appointment didn’t help. (I already knew it wouldn’t because the pain was not “movement adjacent”—no amount of stretching or massage ever touched it—so I was really just in denial). 

At this point the pain is either non existent or a 1/10. At its worst it was never more than like a 3 or 4. It was never about the intensity—just the chronic persistence. So I went online to make an appointment with my PCP and the first available one was end of the month. I was going to wait, but my much wiser wife told me to go to urgent care on Saturday Jan 10th (the next day). 

I went to urgent care and described my symptoms without mentioning kidney stones - and the nurse immediately started asking questions that I knew she was thinking kidney stones. I told her I thought it might be a stone, too and that I’d had one a decade ago. They did a quick urine dip and found blood and proteins in my urine (the blood was not visible - but it was detectible). I thought they’d do an x-ray there (it’s why I chose that urgent care—I knew they had on-site imaging) but they sent me to the ER to get a CT scan. They weren’t too worried as there were no signs of infection or active complete blockage but thought it best to be sure. They called the ER to let them know I was coming. 

After an 8 minute drive I’m registering at the ER. 

(Another aside, two years ago I moved from VA to PA and it was from an area where the closest hospital was 30min away. My new place in PA is in the outskirts of a small city and is no more than 10 minutes from anything including the regional hospital. So nice not to have to drive 20-30 minutes to get to civilization). 

Of course, now I’m a new patient again and go through triage, all the same questions, they ask about my pain levels, etc. They take some blood this time. They also want more urine but I had just given my last oz to urgent care. So they hooked me up with a bag of saline and ordered a CT. 

I was very fortunate for a quick and efficient experience at the ER. I was in the waiting room at 10:22. They had taken blood, had me on the saline and ordered the CT by 10:38. The CT was taken by 10:46. And I had the CT results by 11:33. That’s miracle timelines at any ER! 

Anyway, here are the actual results from the CT report:

* There is a 1.3 x 0.8 cm stone in the left ureteropelvic junction causing mild left hydronephrosis (48 of series 2).
* There is a 0.9 x 0.4 cm nonobstructive stone in the mid left kidney.
* There is a 0.4 cm nonobstructive stone in the lower left kidney.
* There is a 3mm nonobstructive stone in the lower right kidney. No right hydronephrosis is seen.

So… yup. Kidney stones. And the big fellas weren’t going to be passing on their own. 

The ER PA came back in the room just as I was finished reading the scan results (they posted in my patient portal so I got to them first). He started giving me the standard spiel and I told him I saw the results, had a stone before and I got the gist of things. 

Funny story, he then tried to ease my nerves—even though I was showing no signs of nervousness—by telling me how the stone is big but not that big. And how this one patient had a stone the size of an egg and how that patient needed a Percutaneous Nephrolithotomy (PCNL) (though he just said a “tube in his back”) but reassured me that I wouldn’t need that. This is a funny because it didn’t phase me at all; I would love to hear more about his little war story. But he didn’t know me. If it was my wife or mother-in-law his attempt to calm them would have done exactly the opposite and totally freaked them out. As it was, I was glad I told my wife not to come with me.

Anyway, it ended up with a referral to a urologist. The ER PA asked if I needed pain meds and I said no… but he prescribed Percocet anyway “just in case” and he prescribed Flowmax. 

On Monday 1/12, I scheduled a urologist appointment for Jan 21. Note: I filled both prescriptions from the ER but I didn’t need the Percocet and I didn’t want to take the Flowmax until talking to the urologist.

Another funny story. When talking to my parents they mentioned my sister had just passed a couple of stones two weeks ago! That was also her second time with stones. So it clearly runs in the family. My Dad was unsympathetic and just said neither my sister nor I drink enough coffee (neither of drink it at all our whole family thinks we’re weird).

In the meantime, I did some “Dr. Chat GPT” research and was interested to see that since my ESWL a decade ago that the laser lithotripsy was a thing and and that they'd be able to take out the larger fragments at the same time resulting in a faster recovery time. So I was hopeful that when I met with the urologist he’d recommend that.

The urologist appointment was like 10 minutes. I told him I’d read the scan results and that I’d had the ESWL a decade ago. He told me that we should do the new laser litho (which I was glad since I didn’t have to ask him about it) and that I’d have a stent for 7-10 days after the procedure. He asked if I had questions—I didn’t—and sent me to scheduling. I scheduled my procedure for February 3 and had to get blood drawn, an ECG, and surgical clearance from my PCP before then. I’d come back to the office on 2/13 to remove the stent and I’d need an x-ray the day before that. 

I went immediately to the lab place and had the blood and ECG done and I already had a routine checkup with PCP planned for Jan 30. So nothing to do but wait. 

In the intervening days - there were no real changes to my symptoms. The low grade pain/aches would crop up from time to time and last a day or two and go away. 

My wife did however insist that I start drinking more water. I’m happy to say that since that weekend at urgent care I’ve been drinking 75-100oz of water (usually with a few squirts of lemon/lime juice) a day. I’m working on making it a habit; but my long-standing, officially diagnosed ADD makes it a challenge. I've also stopped my iced-tea habit and switched to lemonade (It's not cheap - but Simply brand lemonade is pretty darn good after trying about 4 different brands). 

**Treatment and Recovery**

Fast forward to February 3. My procedure was first thing in the morning. It went well. I never talked to the doc after, but my wife did. He said he “got” most of the stones in the left kidney; the big one and the two smaller ones, too. And successfully placed the stent. As I was coming out of recovery the nurse said the only thing keeping me in the hospital was I had to pee. I tried but couldn’t pee in the recovery room, but once I was back in the patient room I peed right away (the nurse seemed surprised I peed that fast). 

I mentioned I was in quite a bit of pain at that point. The nurse said she could give me something, but I’d have to stay in the hospital for another hour or so to be monitored. I said,”Nope, I wanna go home.” So we were out of there and home by about noon.

I should mention—and I’m not happy with this—the urologist didn’t prescribe ANYTHING for me; no flowmax, no pain meds, no real pain management instructions, nothing. The nurse mentioned using Tylenol—but limiting to 3000 mg per day. I knew from my Dr. Chat GPT research and prior experience what I needed to do, but I was disappointed in the lack of compassionate instructions on this front.

So the rest of that Tuesday I’m in quite a bit of pain. Pee is bloody. Im basically in bed and not sure if I’m recovering more from the anesthesia or the procedure. I really don’t want to take the Percocet if I can avoid it, and I’m limited to 3000mg of Tylenol per day (so basically three doses of two extra-strength Tylenol a day). I slept most of the rest of the day - but by the evening the pain was keeping me from resting. 

This subreddit actually helped me at that point! Since I had nothing other than Tylenol prescribed I started doing some online searching for what might ease the pain from the stent and on some thread someone mentioned Azo. I send my wife out to get some for me and it really helped get through the first few days and then some.

So here’s the timeline since the procedure:

* Tuesday (Procedure Day): Lot pain, lot of rest, ugly bloody pee.
* Wednesday: Felt great, had taken the day off, got some errands and easy chores done. Felt like I had the tylenol/Azo schedule down to stay in front of the discomfort.
* Thursday: Overdid it on Wednesday - felt not great. I work from home and had a normal day, but mostly from bed.
* Friday – Sunday: Some good days some no-so-good days, and other than some active pain from the stent while peeing was never more than just uncomfortable.
* Monday: I had to plow my driveway and little private lane with my little lawn-mower snow-plaw. Figured since I was sitting down it’d be fine - but the twisting to look over my shoulder while backing up irritated the stent. So was uncomfortable the rest of the day.
* Tuesday: Fine
* Tuesday night / Early Wednesday morning: I felt a brief “stabbing” pain around 7pm but it went away. By 2am I was in significant and persistent pain until about 6am. I assume I was actively passing a bigger / pointier fragment. Did a lot of drinking water, walking around my kitchen and feeling sorry for myself until I got to sleep around 6:30. I’ve noticed visible stone fragments in the toilet since then.
* Wednesday: No more pain, but I was deliriously exhausted from the overnight pain and lack of sleep. I tried to work but couldn’t really get much done. I had stopped taking the Azo, but since the pain overnight I’ve started taking it agin and my pee is back to being red/orange.
* Thursday (Today): I feel good. Almost no pain except when peeing. Went to get my x-ray.

So that’s where I am at. Hoping the x-ray is clear and the stent comes out tomorrow. 

That’s a lot of words but—other than the urologist not coving stent pain management—I feel like it has been kind of an ideal scenario across the board. ",1,1770921022.0,KidneyStones,0,1.0,False

1r31ag8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1r31ag8/the_psychology_of_attraction_10_sciencebased/,The Psychology of Attraction: 10 Science-Based Signs Someone's Into You (And Why You Miss Them),"You've been there. That weird tension in the air. The lingering looks. The way someone lights up when you walk into the room. But you second-guess everything because you don't want to look like an idiot who misread the signals. I get it. After diving deep into body language research, evolutionary psychology studies, and even some wild insights from behavioral experts like Vanessa Van Edwards and Matthew Hussey's podcasts, I realized most of us are walking around completely blind to these cues. We're literally programmed to notice attraction signals, but modern anxiety and overthinking have messed with our instincts. So here's what actually happens when someone's into you, backed by science and real human behavior.

## 1. Their Body Literally Turns Toward You

When someone's attracted, their entire body becomes a compass pointing at you. Feet, torso, shoulders. All aimed in your direction. This isn't some magical thing, it's biology. Research from nonverbal communication studies shows that we unconsciously orient ourselves toward things we value or desire.

If you're talking in a group and their feet are pointed at you (not toward the exit or someone else), that's your first clue. Their body is screaming ""I want to be closer to you"" even if their mouth is talking about the weather.

## 2. The Eyes Don't Lie (Especially the Pupils)

Eye contact is obvious, right? Wrong. There's eye contact, and then there's that kind of eye contact. When someone's attracted to you, they hold your gaze a beat longer than normal. But here's the kicker, their pupils dilate. You can't fake that. It's an automatic response controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

A study published in Psychological Science found that pupil dilation is directly linked to emotional arousal and attraction. So if you catch someone's eyes looking bigger than usual when they're talking to you, boom. That's biology doing its thing.

Also, watch for the triangle gaze. Their eyes move from your eyes to your mouth and back. That's not accidental. That's their brain imagining what it would be like to kiss you.

## 3. They Mirror Your Movements

Mirroring is one of those sneaky signs that flies completely under the radar. When someone's attracted, they subconsciously copy your body language. You lean in, they lean in. You cross your legs, they cross theirs. You pick up your drink, guess what? They're reaching for theirs too.

This comes from research on rapport building and connection. Mirroring creates a sense of ""we're alike"" and builds intimacy without anyone saying a word. Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in her work on charisma and connection, how mirroring is one of the most powerful nonverbal cues of attraction.

## 4. They Find Excuses to Touch You

Touch is huge. But we're not talking about obvious, over the top contact. It's the light brush on your arm when they're making a point. The ""accidental"" bump when you're walking. The playful shove when you make a joke.

According to touch research in social psychology, even brief, casual touch increases feelings of connection and attraction. If someone keeps finding reasons to be in your physical space or makes light contact, their brain is testing the waters. They want to see how you respond to closeness.

## 5. They Remember Weird, Random Details About You

Someone who's attracted to you pays attention. Like, creepy levels of attention (but in a good way). They remember that offhand comment you made three weeks ago about hating cilantro. They ask about your dog by name. They bring up something you mentioned in passing like it's important.

Why? Because to them, you are important. Our brains prioritize information about people we care about or are attracted to. It's called selective attention. If they're cataloging the small stuff, it means you're taking up real estate in their mind.

## 6. Their Voice Changes When They Talk to You

This one's wild but real. Research shows that people alter their vocal tone when speaking to someone they're attracted to. Women's voices often get slightly higher and more melodic. Men's voices can drop lower, becoming more resonant.

It's not a conscious thing. It's an evolutionary tactic to sound more appealing. A study from the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior found that vocal modulation is a key indicator of romantic interest. So if someone sounds different around you compared to how they talk to others, take note.

## 7. They Laugh at Everything You Say (Even Your Bad Jokes)

Laughter is a social bonding tool, and when someone's into you, they're going to laugh at your jokes even when they're not that funny. I'm talking full on giggling at your dumb puns.

This ties into something called ""humor affiliation."" When we're attracted to someone, we want to signal that we enjoy their company and find them entertaining. Laughter creates positive associations and releases feel good chemicals like dopamine and endorphins. If they're laughing more around you than seems normal, they're basically telling their brain, ""I like this person.""

## 8. They Get Nervous or Fidgety Around You

Attraction isn't always smooth. Sometimes it makes people awkward as hell. If someone fidgets with their hair, adjusts their clothes, or seems a little jittery when you're around, that's nervous energy. It means they care what you think about them.

The book The Like Switch by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) dives into how nervousness and self grooming behaviors are attraction indicators. People primp and fidget because they want to look good for you. It's your brain's way of saying, ""Don't screw this up.""

If you want to go deeper into understanding these patterns and build real social confidence, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls insights from relationship psychology books, dating expert interviews, and behavioral research to create personalized audio learning. 

It generates custom podcasts based on goals like ""become more magnetic in dating"" or ""read social cues better as an introvert."" You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, including a smoky, conversational tone that makes complex psychology feel like chatting with a smart friend. It's built by Columbia grads and backed by a growing library of dating coaches, communication experts, and peer-reviewed studies.

## 9. They Go Out of Their Way to Be Near You

This one's pretty straightforward but easy to miss. If someone consistently shows up where you are (even when it's not convenient), that's intentional. They take the long route to pass your desk. They happen to be at the same coffee shop. They volunteer for projects you're on.

Proximity is everything in attraction. We're more likely to develop feelings for people we see regularly (it's called the mere exposure effect). If they're engineering situations to be around you, it's because being near you matters to them.

## 10. They Ask Personal Questions and Actually Listen

When someone's attracted, they want to know you. Not just surface level chitchat, but real stuff. They ask about your dreams, your past, your weird hobbies. And here's the key, they actually listen. They follow up on things you told them before. They engage deeply with your answers.

This comes back to investment. People invest time and emotional energy into people they care about. If they're treating conversations with you like they're collecting puzzle pieces to understand who you are, that's attraction.

Here's the thing. Biology, psychology, and evolutionary wiring all play massive roles in how attraction works. These signs aren't guarantees, humans are messy and unpredictable. But if you're seeing multiple signals from this list, chances are high that person feels something.

The real challenge isn't spotting the signs. It's trusting yourself enough to believe them. Stop overthinking. Start noticing. And maybe, just maybe, take the leap and see what happens.",1,1770920970.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

As expected, the best coffee is exported. Second-class coffee is sold as premium coffee locally, while all the poor-quality coffee is mostly purchased by big coffee companies for instant coffee or other purposes.

The saddest part is that local vendors offer “fresh ground” organic premium coffee as a high-quality coffee, and people pay around 5 USD per 12 oz. See the attached picture of that premium coffee. 

Of course there are real premium coffee for the local market, but it is limited.

1r318nk,https://www.reddit.com/r/MensDiscipline/comments/1r318nk/how_to_be_genuinely_likable_the_psychology_tricks/,How to Be Genuinely Likable: The Psychology Tricks That Actually Work,"okay so i've been reading way too much social psychology lately and holy shit, the gap between what we think makes us likable versus what actually does is wild. we're out here trying to be impressive, interesting, successful, when the research shows we've been playing the game all wrong.

studied this from like 15+ books, research papers, podcasts (Huberman Lab's episode on social connection is insane), and honestly just observing what makes certain people magnetic. this isn't about manipulation, it's about understanding how human connection actually works so you can stop self-sabotaging.

the thing is, most of our likability issues aren't even our fault. our brains evolved for small tribal groups, not navigating complex modern social dynamics. we're wired to be defensive, self-focused, status-conscious because that kept us alive. but those same instincts now make us insufferable in a coffee shop conversation. the good news? once you understand the psychology, you can work with your brain instead of against it.

**shut up and listen (like actually listen)**

people don't remember what you said, they remember how you made them feel. the fastest way to make someone feel good? genuine curiosity about their life. not the fake ""how was your weekend"" while planning your response. real listening where you're trying to understand their perspective.

[**The Charisma Myth**](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11910905-the-charisma-myth) by Olivia Fox Cabane breaks this down perfectly. she's coached everyone from Fortune 500 execs to Stanford students on presence. the book explains how charisma isn't some magical quality, it's just presence + warmth + power. and presence means shutting off that voice in your head critiquing everything and actually focusing on the other person. sounds simple but when's the last time you had a conversation without planning your next clever comment?

technique: ask follow-up questions that show you were actually listening. ""wait so when your boss said that, how did that make you feel?"" instead of ""oh yeah my boss is terrible too let me tell you about...""

**remember their name and use it (sounds cringe but it works)**

Carnegie's old but his **How to Win Friends and Influence People** still hits. there's actual neuroscience behind why hearing our own name activates the brain's pleasure centers. it signals ""this person sees me as an individual, not just another face.""

when you meet someone, repeat their name immediately. ""nice to meet you Sarah"" then use it naturally once or twice in conversation. not every sentence like a psycho, but enough that it registers.

**be warm first, competent second**

we think showing off our achievements makes people like us. wrong. Princeton research shows warmth is evaluated before competence in first impressions. people need to trust you before they care how smart you are.

which means: smile (genuine smiles, the ones that crinkle your eyes), open body language, admit when you don't know something, show vulnerability. [**Daring Greatly**](https://brenebrown.com/book/daring-greatly/) by Brené Brown gets into this, she's spent 20 years researching vulnerability and shame. the book feels like someone explaining why you've been exhausting yourself pretending to have it all together when that's exactly what's pushing people away. vulnerability isn't weakness, it's the thing that makes you relatable instead of that annoying person who humble-brags constantly.

if you want to go deeper on social psychology and communication skills but don't have the energy to read through all these books, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450). it's a personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert insights on topics like social skills and emotional intelligence, then turns them into custom audio episodes. you can set specific goals like ""become more likable in social situations as an introvert"" and it builds an adaptive learning plan based on your unique challenges. 

you control the depth too, a quick 10-minute overview or a 40-minute deep dive with examples when something really clicks. plus you get to pick the voice style, some of them are surprisingly engaging which helps when you're commuting or at the gym. it's helped me connect the dots between all these psychology concepts way faster than trying to plow through book after book.

**mirror subtly (emphasis on subtly)**

we like people who are similar to us. mirroring body language, speech patterns, energy levels triggers unconscious rapport. lean back when they lean back. match their pace, if they're chill don't be manic.

this can feel manipulative but honestly you already do it naturally with people you vibe with. you're just being intentional about it. don't copy every gesture like a mime, just aim for similar energy.

**ask for small favors (backwards but effective)**

Ben Franklin effect: people who do you a favor end up liking you more because their brain justifies ""i wouldn't help someone i dislike, so i must like them."" ask someone for a small favor, thank them genuinely, suddenly they're invested in you.

""hey could you recommend a good coffee shop around here?"" ""do you have a pen i could borrow?"" not massive asks, just small things that let them help you.

**be genuinely happy for their success**

nothing kills likability faster than subtle competitiveness or that forced ""happy for you"" energy when someone shares good news. **Psychologist John Gottman's research** (the guy who can predict divorce with scary accuracy) shows how we respond to good news matters more than how we respond to bad news.

active constructive responding: when someone shares something good, match their enthusiasm, ask questions, celebrate with them. ""that's amazing! how did you pull that off? you must be so proud."" not ""cool. anyway..."" 

**stop trying to be interesting, be interested**

the paradox is trying to seem interesting makes you boring. asking interesting questions makes you magnetic. people leave conversations thinking ""wow they're so easy to talk to"" when really you just let them talk about themselves.

questions that go deeper: ""what's been exciting you lately?"" ""if you could change one thing about your field what would it be?"" ""what's something you believed five years ago that you don't anymore?""

**Insight Timer** (meditation app but has great stuff on social anxiety and presence) helped me get out of my head during conversations. when you're anxious about how you're coming across, you're not present. you're not likable because you're not actually there.

**admit mistakes quickly and with humor**

trying to save face or justify mistakes is exhausting for everyone involved. just own it, ideally with self-deprecating humor, and move on. shows confidence and makes you human.

""yeah i completely misread that situation, i'm an idiot"" with a laugh does more for your likability than 10 minutes of explaining why it wasn't really your fault.

**the gossip rule: only positive or neutral**

negative gossip feels bonding in the moment but research shows people subconsciously associate you with the traits you describe in others. talk shit about someone being lazy? they now associate ""lazy"" with you even though you were criticizing someone else.

compliment people behind their backs. when it gets back to them (and it will) you've just made a friend.

look, none of this is revolutionary. it's mostly just remembering people want to feel seen, heard, valued. we're all walking around desperate for genuine connection but too scared or self-focused to create it. 

the skills are learnable. charisma isn't some genetic lottery, it's mostly just emotional intelligence and getting out of your own way. practice this stuff even when it feels awkward. your brain will adapt, it'll become natural, and you'll notice people responding differently.

anyway that's what worked for me after years of being that tryhard person wondering why conversations felt like pulling teeth.",1,1770920861.0,MensDiscipline,0,1.0,False

For example, if you're working at a coffee shop and have your chess board, you could show in your profile that anyone interested in playing can join you.  Or if you are at a coworking space and could use help with something, you could share that so other users can reach out if they can help.

1r315h0,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1r315h0/i_met_a_girl_during_a_valentines_commercial_shoot/,I met a girl during a Valentine’s commercial shoot and things got complicated really fast 26M - 23F not sure what to do now.,"So about 3 weeks ago, a friend of mine randomly called me to participate in a commercial shoot at a 5‑star hotel. I’m not a model at all i have an IT company and know nothing about modeling , he just needed someone that looks good and invited me. The commercial was for Valentine’s Day, and they also brought another model to act as my partner , a very attractive blonde girl.

In the shooting day, we really hit it off. The energy was great, we laughed a lot, and she was clearly flirting with me on multiple occasions. It honestly surprised me because I wasn’t trying anything if anything, I was the one being distant at first. She even mentioned that she felt like a “fan” because I wasn’t giving her much attention.

After the shoot I offered her a ride home, she accepted, and during the drive she opened up a lot about herself. The conversation flowed naturally and everything felt easy, i gave her a flower when i dropped her off that i snatched from the hotel

Later she suggested that we use the free one‑night hotel stay the production gave us (we could choose a date as part of the payment) and go together in the same date. We kept talking lightly on Instagram after that, discussing what we might do at the hotel, joking around, getting to know each other more. Nothing sexual, just good vibes and natural chemistry, the only annoying thing was that she wanted me to be as her photographer in that day

When the hotel day came, everything started great. We laughed, went out to get food, and sat in the car by the beach talking. But at some point i realized her behavior changed. She became partially distant and kinda uncomfortable with physical contact , which confused me because during the first shoot she had been very touchy and openly flirtatious , i didn’t try to force anything as she seems to be enjoying sitting very close to each other in my hotel room sofa  and then it’s like something talks to her and she jumps away and stands a bit far , i wasn’t even trying anything at this point,

That night at the hotel she was very guarded and protective of herself, and eventually I understood why.

At dinner we were laughing and then suddenly she showed me the Instagram of a girl she said she kept following and unfollowing. That girl happened to be someone I had a situationship with in the past , she wasn’t completely over me. I could have lied and said I didn’t know her, but I told the truth: we had something about 2 years ago and briefly made out again a couple weeks earlier in the new year party , nothing serious.

She asked to see the girl’s private profile from my phone , didn’t think nothing of it and gave her my phone , she started checking highlights. Then she noticed something photos showing her ex and that girl at the same place and same dates on a camping trip.  they had been together

At first I didn’t understand why she was so frustrated, but then everything made sense.

She spent the entire night talking about her ex. She told me she had just gone through an abortion recently very fresh, happened this month. She was describing painful things but with almost no visible emotion, like her face was completely firm while saying heavy words, it seems like she’s emotionally disconnected and destroyed , and having regret about having the abortion and she feels like she killed her child , and the ex was with her and he made sure she did the abortion he disappeared after few days , We didn’t sleep, didn’t do anything romantic, nothing , just hours of her trauma dumping until around 5 AM and i am not mad about that

I tried to comfort her and be supportive, but it felt endless she knows what happened showed no emotion and seems like she’s okey with it

After that we kept minimal contact on Instagram and met again a week later for coffee. Same pattern more talking about her ex and her situation. When I dropped her off, I told her honestly that if we’re going to keep meeting, I don’t want every conversation to be about her ex. I even said I hope he calls her back if that’s what she wants, because he had ghosted her 14 days after the abortion.

I didn’t initiate anything after that, but she called me again and suggested we go out again , she wanted to meet somewhere far away about a 1.5 hour drive in a small time that’s cosy and by the sea side that would make a great date

That day actually went really well. I gently prevented the conversation from going back to her ex, we had breakfast, went to a coffee shop, walked around, and I took a few photos of her. The vibe was good and relaxed. We even met again the next day. She told me she wanted to be loved “aggressively” , that she wants to fall in love again and thanked me for the previous day

But today something really bothered me.

When I tried to express something positive about her and tell her I enjoy her company, I suddenly realized how self‑centered and disconnected from reality she seems.

We were out and she spent an extremely long time talking about her hairstyle, her photos, her shoots constantly showing pictures of herself. It felt obsessive. I tried several times to smoothly shift the conversation to something else, but she kept interrupting or talking over me and redirecting everything back to herself.

I realized I barely said anything about myself the entire time. I just listened to her talk about superficial things , her appearance, her pictures, her image. Whenever I tried to change topics, she’d immediately bring it back.

Later at the beach she again started talking about her ex. I teased her to stop and tried to change the subject, but she kept bringing him up repeatedly until I was mentally exhausted.

When I dropped her off, she said she wants a strong love relationship. I told her honestly that I don’t think she actually does ,because if she did, she would be open to it and emotionally available for it wish is not a reality right now.

After I left, she texted me saying she forgot her study papers in my car. I told her they’re there and she can call me to pick them up.

Now I’m seriously considering cutting her out of my life completely. The whole situation feels overwhelming. It seems like everything revolves around her her trauma, her needs, her image and I don’t feel like I can handle constant trauma dumping or what feels like very high emotional demands.

I’m conflicted because there were moments of genuine connection and good energy, but at the same time I feel drained and unheard.

I am thinking about walking away ?

I don’t want to walk away but i think if i stay i will get my heart broken , i thought about it a lot and looked over her past abortion and trauma as i like her as a person, but i can’t be with her if she acts as i am just a therapist one day and telling me she wants to be loved the next day , i can’t also be frienzoned and stick around, my intentions are clear

I believe in loving deeply and i am a great person, she has too many fans and she loves herself too much that i am afraid this will exhaust me in the future",1,1770920669.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Our baby ended up falling asleep on the drive there, so I stayed behind in the car with her while my husband went and grabbed us drinks. 

When he came back to the car, he pointed out a group of moms with their little ones coming out of the coffee shop. (He does this pretty regularly, where he points out other moms because he wants me to go make friends as a first-time mom/new mom). I mentioned casually ""oh, maybe they will be going to storytime too."" 

We waited in the car for what was like 5 minutes. I commented that we should get going. He said, ""well, we will just wait in the car till story time begins."" Then I said again that we should get going. He starts the car then stops and says ""I would rather follow the convoy of moms"" and I was like ""what???"" because it was visible that the moms were still chatting/putting their kids in their cars etc....

I said, ""Why would you do that? You don't know these women. You don't know if they are actually going to the library or not.. That is like straight up 101 stalkerish, things women have to constantly worry about. And, if they do notice that you are following them, they will probably get worried. That's really creepy.""

He then got really angry at me, shouted and said ""nevermind! Forget I said anything."" But, he was angry during the car ride from the coffee shop to the library, has not spoken to me since. 

Was I wrong to call him out on his behavior for being creepy??? Was it not creepy at all? Does he have a right to be angry at what I said?

1r312p2,https://i.redd.it/er0w85ivv3jg1.jpeg,I’m drowning,"THE WEIGHT OF HIS OWN HANDS

He always came back to his hands. What they’d held. What they’d broken. What they’d

reached for in desperation. What they’d let slip through their fingers because he didn’t

know how to hold anything gently. His hands were the first truth he could no longer outrun.

They were never clean, not even in the moments he convinced himself he was trying. He

stood in the bathroom with the door half‑closed, the light too bright for the hour, gripping

the sink like it was the only thing keeping him upright. His reflection stared back at him with

the kind of honesty he’d spent years avoiding. He whispered it to the mirror, not as

punishment but as acknowledgment. “You did this.” The words didn’t echo. They landed.

Heavy. Accurate.

He wasn’t the misunderstood hero clawing his way out of darkness. He wasn’t the tragic

figure people romanticize in poems. He was the man who lied when the truth would’ve cost

him less. The man who chased relief like it was oxygen. The man who mistook escape for

survival. Addiction didn’t just live in her. It lived in him too. Different shape. Same hunger.

His wasn’t always chemical. Sometimes it was attention. Sometimes it was chaos.

Sometimes it was the quiet numbness that came after a lie, the temporary peace before

the consequences arrived. His hands trembled,not from withdrawal, but from recognition.

They had been instruments of avoidance long before they ever tried to be instruments of

change.

He splashed water on his face, but the cold didn’t shock him back into anything resembling

clarity. It only made him aware of how tired he was tired in a way that sleep couldn’t fix.

Tired in a way that came from years of running from himself. He dried his face with a towel

and stared at the faint imprint of his hands on the fabric. Even that felt symbolic. Everything

did now.

She lay awake on the other side of the bed, staring at the ceiling with her hands folded over

her stomach like she was holding herself together. She wasn’t crying. She’d passed the

crying stage months ago. Now she lived in the quiet ache of someone who had run out of

explanations. She whispered into the dark, not expecting him to hear. “I don’t know who I’m

sleeping next to anymore.” But she did know. She knew exactly who he was. She just didn’t

know which version she’d get on any given night.

She had her own addictions, control, chaos, the need to fix what wasn’t hers to fix. She

stayed because she recognized the ache in his eyes. Recognition masquerading as love.

That’s how it started. Her hands curled into fists beneath the blanket, not out of anger but

out of exhaustion. She had been holding on for so long that her fingers had forgotten how to

release anything.

In the morning, the silence between them felt like a third presence in the room. It sat at the

foot of the bed, followed them into the kitchen, hovered between their breaths. He poured

coffee with hands that shook just enough for her to notice. She didn’t comment. She didn’t

have the energy to decode another half‑truth. He set her mug down gently, as if gentleness

could erase the damage. She wrapped her hands around it for warmth, not comfort.

The arguments were never about the real issue. They were about the symptoms, the smoke,

the fallout. In the kitchen, she stood by the counter with her arms crossed while he leaned

against the fridge, hands shoved deep in his pockets like he could hide the truth in there.

“Where were you?” she asked. He exhaled sharply. “I told you. I needed air.” “For four

hours?” Her voice didn’t rise. It didn’t need to. His fingers twitched inside his pockets. He

didn’t know which lie would sound the least like a lie. She shook her head. “You think I’m

stupid.” “I never said that.” “You don’t have to. I can feel it.” He wanted to reach for her, but

his hands stayed buried, cowardice disguised as restraint. She brushed past him. “I can’t

keep doing this.” He didn’t stop her. His hands stayed still.

He remembered the first lie. It was small, forgettable, the kind of lie people tell every day

without consequence. She asked if he was okay. He wasn’t. But he smiled and said, “Yeah,

I’m fine.” His hands were steady then, too steady. That was the first hit. The first taste of

emotional anesthesia. He didn’t know that every lie after that would cost him pieces of

himself. Didn’t know that avoidance would become his drug of choice. Addiction rarely

announces itself. It whispers. It bargains. It promises comfort. His hands learned to hide

the truth long before his mouth did.

She remembered the first time she stayed. He’d disappeared for a night and returned with

apologies that sounded borrowed. His hands shook when he spoke. She noticed. She

pretended she didn’t. She should’ve left. She knew it even then. But she saw herself in him,

her own wounds, her own patterns, her own hunger for something that felt like belonging.

She stayed because she recognized the chaos. She stayed because she thought she could

help. She stayed because leaving felt like abandoning a version of herself she hadn’t healed

yet. Her hands reached for him, and that was the beginning of the end.

Late one night, honesty slipped out because exhaustion lowered the guard. He sat on the

edge of the bed with his elbows on his knees, hands dangling between them. “I don’t want

to be this man,” he said quietly. She looked at him with eyes that were soft but tired. “Then

stop being him.” He shook his head. “It’s not that simple.” “It is,” she said. “You just don’t

want the version of simple that requires work.” His hands clenched. “I’m trying.” “I know,”

she said. “But you’re trying to change the symptoms, not the disease.” He didn’t know how

to respond. His hands opened and closed like he was practicing letting go.

The breaking point wasn’t dramatic. It wasn’t a betrayal or a blowout fight. It was breakfast.

She stirred her coffee long after the sugar dissolved, her hand moving in slow circles. He

watched her, knowing something irreversible was coming. Finally, she said, “I can’t love you

into being whole.” He nodded. Not because he agreed. Because he finally understood. She

wasn’t leaving him. She was leaving the version of herself that kept trying to save him. His

hands went still on the table, palms flat, as if bracing for impact.

When she packed, it was quiet. No yelling. No accusations. Just two people who had finally

stopped pretending. He stood in the doorway, hands hanging uselessly at his sides. She

paused before stepping out. “I hope you find the man you keep trying to be.” He nodded. “I

hope you find the peace you keep giving away.” She smiled, sad, soft, real. Then she left.

His hands didn’t reach for her. For once, they didn’t try to hold on to something he wasn’t

meant to keep.

After she was gone, the house felt too big. Too quiet. Too honest. He walked through the

rooms like a man taking inventory of a life he’d never fully inhabited. His hands brushed

over the back of the couch, the edge of the counter, the frame of the doorway she used to

lean against. Everything felt like a relic. Everything felt like a reminder. He sat on the floor in

the living room, legs stretched out, hands resting on his thighs. For the first time in years, he

didn’t feel the urge to run. He didn’t feel the need to lie. He didn’t feel the instinct to reach

for something that would numb him.

He felt the weight of his own hands.

Not clean.

Not redeemed.

But honest.

And that was enough to begin again, not with redemption, not with absolution, but with the

truth he could finally hold without shaking

The first night alone was the loudest silence he had ever heard. It filled the house like fog,

thick, shapeless, impossible to escape. He walked from room to room without purpose,

again touching the back of the couch, the edge of the counter, the frame of the doorway

she used to lean against. His hands moved as if searching for proof that she had been real,

that the life they’d built, however fractured, hadn’t been a hallucination he’d conjured to

feel less alone.

He sat on the floor in the living room, legs stretched out, hands resting on his thighs. The

quiet pressed against him, not gently but insistently, like it was trying to force him to hear

something he’d spent years drowning out. He had always filled silence with noise, music,

distractions, other people’s validation, the hum of chaos. Now there was nothing. Just him.

Just the truth. Just the weight of his own hands.

He didn’t sleep that night. He drifted in and out of shallow, restless half‑dreams where she

was still there, still breathing beside him, still stirring her coffee in slow circles. But every

time he opened his eyes, the room was empty. His hands reached instinctively for the

space where she used to lie, and the cold sheets felt like a reprimand.

By morning, the house felt foreign. He made coffee out of habit, but the ritual felt hollow.

He poured two mugs before realizing the second one had no purpose anymore. He stared

at it for a long moment before pouring it down the sink. The sound of the liquid hitting the

drain felt like a small funeral.

He sat at the kitchen table with his hands wrapped around his own mug, the warmth doing

nothing to thaw the heaviness in his chest. He wasn’t crying. He didn’t know if he could.

The grief wasn’t sharp, it was dull, heavy, a slow suffocation rather than a stab. It wasn’t

just about losing her. It was about losing the version of himself he had pretended to be

when she was around.

He had always been good at performing. Good at saying the right things, promising the right

changes, offering the right apologies. But now there was no one to perform for. No one to

convince. No one to lie to. The only audience left was himself, and he wasn’t buying it

anymore.

The unraveling didn’t happen all at once. It came in waves.

The first wave hit when he opened the closet and saw the empty hangers where her clothes

used to be. His hands hovered over them, fingers brushing the metal like he was touching a

ghost. He closed the door quickly, as if shutting it could stop the ache from spreading.

The second wave came when he found her hair tie on the bathroom counter. A small,

insignificant object. But it held more truth than any of the words they’d exchanged in the

final weeks. He picked it up and held it in his palm, feeling the stretch of the elastic, the

faint warmth of memory. He didn’t know what to do with it. Throwing it away felt cruel.

Keeping it felt pathetic. He set it back down, unsure which choice would hurt less.

The third wave came when he realized he didn’t know what to do with his time. Their

routines had been built around each other, shared meals, shared nights, shared

distractions. Now the hours stretched out like an empty road. He tried cleaning, but his

hands shook too much. He tried watching TV, but the noise felt abrasive. He tried going for

a walk, but every street reminded him of a conversation, a fight, a moment they’d tried to

salvage something already sinking.

By the second day, the silence had shifted. It wasn’t just loud, it was accusatory. It forced

him to confront the parts of himself he had always avoided. The lies. The disappearances.

The hunger for escape. The way he had used her love as a shield against his own

emptiness.

He sat on the edge of the bed, elbows on his knees, hands dangling between them. He

stared at the floor, at the faint imprint of her side of the mattress. He whispered into the

quiet, “I don’t know how to do this.” The silence didn’t answer. It didn’t comfort. It didn’t

judge. It simply existed, waiting for him to stop running.

On the third day, he tried to rebuild something—anything. He made a list of things he

needed to face. Not tasks. Truths. He wrote them down in shaky handwriting:

• Stop lying to yourself.

• Stop pretending you’re fine.

• Stop expecting shortcuts.

• Stop confusing relief with healing.

• Stop reaching for the easiest escape.

• Start sitting with the discomfort.

• Start telling the truth even when it hurts.

• Start being the man you keep promising to become.

He stared at the list for a long time. His hands hovered over the paper, unsure whether to

crumple it or commit to it. He didn’t know if he could do any of it. But he knew he couldn’t

keep doing what he had been doing.

He folded the paper carefully and placed it on the nightstand. It wasn’t a solution. It wasn’t

redemption. It wasn’t even a plan. It was a beginning. A small one. A fragile one. But a

beginning nonetheless.

That night, he sat on the floor again, back against the wall, hands resting on his knees. He

breathed slowly, deliberately, letting the silence settle around him without fighting it. He

didn’t feel better. He didn’t feel healed. He didn’t feel transformed.

He felt present.

And for a man who had spent years disappearing from himself, presence was a kind of

progress.

He looked down at his hands, still unclean, still unsteady, still carrying the weight of every

mistake he’d made. But for the first time, he didn’t look away. He didn’t hide them. He

didn’t pretend they were something they weren’t.

He accepted them.

Not as symbols of guilt.

But as tools for rebuilding.

Hands that had broken things could also mend them.

Hands that had pushed people away could learn to hold gently.

Hands that had lied could learn to tell the truth.

Hands that had reached for escape could learn to reach for something real.

He wasn’t there yet.

He wasn’t even close.

But he was finally facing the right direction.

And in the quiet, in the stillness, in the raw honesty of being alone with himself, he

whispered the first truth that felt like hope.

She wanted her grandmother. She ached for that warm embrace of protection and security, but all she had was the hard, metallic chill pressing against her skull. Dust and the chemical tang of the lab air filled her nose. She didn't know how everything had ended up like this. Drawing her knees in, she squeezed her eyes shut and pressed the back of her head to the slick, cold surface of the filing cabinet. The faint hum of lights pulsed overhead, masked by the thudding in her chest. The press of the metal reminded her she wasn't even working in the sub-sections—her office was one floor up from the basement, close to the sub-sections but not quite there. Each breath caught in her throat, deep and shaky, making her chest feel tight. She forced herself to turn her head, heart hammering, and glanced behind the cabinet. Movement snagged her vision: one of the creations marching over the tiles, its black, simmering frame sliding into a fresh cadaver. Her stomach lurched as its spire-shaped head snapped upward through the man's cranium, the wet crack sharp and too close. Panic closed in. They wanted to be like us; they wanted to be us. Smart men across the world got together and created artificial intelligence made of organic matter, endowing it with free will. What the fuck did they think was going to happen to everyone? Especially when everything was already controlled and manipulated with AI. She wiped her tears away, but her hands shook, and her sleeve smeared the glob of snot that had slipped from her sniveling nostrils. She realized too late she hadn’t brought a scrunchie; her mahogany hair, usually smooth and curly, was now a wild mess of frizz and tangles around her face. Her eyes burned, vision blurring from tears and exhaustion. Blood pulsed in her ears. Forcing slow, ragged breaths, she steadied herself, pushing off the cabinet. Her legs trembled as she stumbled upright. Without looking back, she hurtled toward the emergency exit, adrenaline drowning out pain and reason. The beast moved too slowly for her incredible burst of desperation, and she slammed through the door, tripping so hard she tumbled down an entire flight of stairs before scrambling to get back up.

She took the stairs up two or three at a time. She was close to getting up the five flights she needed to go up before reaching the lobby that led her to the front door. She burst open the stairwell door and ran right into one of their security guys. Mr. Larry, right now, was calmer than he needed to be. His demeanor, in fact, was slack and bubbly. She looked at him, perplexed, then noticed his skin. His flesh rippled and fluttered so quickly under the surface it looked like he was boiling, as if something inside him was trying to break free. She couldn't tear her eyes away from the uncanny motion—skin shifting, unsettled and alive.

“Hiya there Tyra.” Mr. Larry’s dark, honey-brown brow was also wiggling as if his veins had come alive and were dancing under the muscles around his skull. 

“Nope,” was all she managed to say before twirling around and bolting back through the stairwell door and sprinting up further into the building. 

These beasts, the aliens, whatever you want to name them, are fast when they are not draped in a human body. They seek the internal warmth of every soul's radiation. They squat their tall, thin bodies, and with two spires for arms, reach into the back, snap the spine, and pry it open. Then they push their spire-ended legs through the man as if he were putting on a pair of pants, then it would pull up the top and meld the back seam together with some kind of fleshy goo. The creations didn't take the host well, to say the least. The infection begins to spike and boil as its skin flutters frantically across the body. 

She ran up two more flights of stairs before rushing into the fourth-floor offices. On her arrival, she was caught immediately by a vice grip, and she could not help the blood-curdling screams that belted from her body. Her captor let her settle down before placing her back on her feet. 

“Mr. Ronnie? Miranda”? She asked breathlessly, trying to get her stammering heart under control. 

“Where did you come from”? My other security guard asked. 

“Lobby”. Looking around the room, the only available exit was through the shatterproof windows. 

“We were there too.” Miranda was hugging her tiny shoulders with one arm and absentmindedly twirling a strand of her blonde hair into a curl. 

“How is the gun?” Tyra noticed the assigned pistol he was given upon receiving the job. 

Mr. Ronnie pulled his weapon out of its holster, wrinkled his dark chestnut face into a furrowed brow, and shook his head. “Doesn't do a damn thing”. You could hear the exasperation in his tone. 

Tyra watched Mr. Ronnie wipe his forehead, a foreboding sign of exasperation and defeat. 

“Who else is… Normal”? Asking that question was not what it used to be. In what term was normal actually? To whose standards does it declare what is normal and what is not? But we are in a whole new reality, and we just wanted fucking normal. 

“We have stayed hunkered down here for the most part.” Mr. Ronnie motioned to the multiple barricades he had set up around the entire floor. 

“What are we going to do”? Seeing Miranda's lip quiver just let hope flee from Tyra’s soul. What were they going to do? 

They all sat in a pondering silence, waiting for some epiphany to hit them like a bullet at any minute now, some kind of revelation that would reveal their escape. Then it came. Not a flash of understanding, but a sound. Soft, at first. 

Knock.

A single, hollow tap, almost like it could be ignored.

Knock. Knock.

Another. Louder. The rhythm began to pulse through the floor, climbing the walls, filling the stale, waiting air. 

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Each blow was slower than the one before, stretching time, squeezing silence out of every crack. The knock, knock, knock was nonsalutary and unheating; even the voice that came after was a comfort you shouldn't feel from a stranger. The sweet allure of some desperate man in need of some help.

“Ooopen the door.” The mutant told on itself with its raspy inhale at the end of each word. It was a sound close to animalistic, but in a different way, more predatory. “Open the door.” It cooed at us with temptation, each and every syllable starved and beckoning. 

The voice made Tyra feel a certain way, with every muscle in her body becoming lax and too pliable. Through a daze, she even found herself moving; she was shifting towards the door, towards the tune of the man's voice. Mr. Ronnie snatched me up so fast, and Miranda smacked her in the face. 

“Don’t fall for it.” Mr. Ronnie was grave. “You need to stay alert.” 

Tyra listened as desperation crawled into their calls. More and more voices and moans erupted from the other side of every barricade. Tyra pondered on how they haven’t been able to break through yet, and it dawned on her that they must only possess the strength of whoever they are wearing. They were not strong by nature, so a compatible host would be formidable and tough. It was such a wonder how all of this got started.

Snippets of classified memos flickered through Tyra’s memory, old phrases from glowing screens or security briefings: ""Projects on sub-level two strictly compartmentalized."" ""All weekly updates sent directly to High Clearance Only."" Even in the chaos, she caught herself remembering warnings never to share research outside secure channels. Each promotion brought thicker NDA stacks and more paperwork stamped confidential. She remembered rumors exchanged in coffee lines—just idle speculation about scientists trying to invent a new race, part machine, part organism. Everyone, Tyra included, dismissed it as mad science, like some group was trying to play god. But now, those weekly newsletters and the constant reminder that ""the further down you go, the fewer questions you ask"" pressed hard on her mind. This was past the AI that had begun the avalanche; now, they were hunted, just hosts for parasites born of secrets nobody was ever supposed to know.

The BANG BANG BANG was a repeated melody rattling through Tyra’s skull. Even when everything fell silent, there was still the BANG BANG BANG. Her heart was revving like a race car tearing through the track at a million miles per hour. Then there was the laughter. An echoing cry that sounded both wounded and malicious. Miranda was running a path in the carpet, with her circling around and around. She didn't have any more fingernails to chew, and at this point, one could only assume she was now breaking skin. Tyra was just numb with fear and perplexity, not knowing what to do next, not knowing how to get out safely. She wasn't trained for any kind of physical altercation. She was just a doctor in a highly prestigious lab. She had no defense. Mr. Ronnie was big, though, maybe the biggest man they had in the building. Tyra certainly couldn't fight through the horde outside the doors, but he sure as fuck could fight past them while Tyra and Miranda use any weapon they can find to help clear the path. Then they needed to go down.

“Any ideas on how to kill it? Hurt it? Incapacitate it?”

I was digging, begging god for answers. The words hung in the air, unfinished, swallowed by the thudding in my chest...

“What is there to even use? We are in a damn office. What am I gonna do, staple them to death?” Miranda was frantic and becoming more manic with fear by the second. 

“Burning it might be an answer.” Tyra was just thinking of any way to get them through the mob as safely as possible. 

“What would we use to make fire?” Miranda was sarcastic and uninterested, now consumed by a coming fate that had no escape. It was a heavy realization. 

“I have a lighter.” Mr. Ronnie is in for the win. 

“I have a couple of lighters in my purse and a carton of cigarettes that are screaming my name.” Mirianda needed more than a cigarette; she needed some damn Xanax. 

“I bet there are aerosol cans, disinfecting spray, a whole lotta shit that has butane.” Blessed by God, she knew how to set fires with just about anything; it was once an unstable practice of hers. 

“Okay, we have fire. Now what?” Mr. Ronnie gripped his hips tightly and slowly rocked back and forth from his heels. 

“Okay. We use Mr. Ronnie as the tank; he will lead us on the front lines, armed with his weapon of choice. Then Miranda and I will use fire to keep them at bay while we can make a run past them.” The suggestion was weak, but it was the only one anyone could come up with in this panicked situation. 

Tyra always found it odd that, in states of great stress, a mind shuts itself down to protect itself from nerve damage, when, in fact, it should be at its highest point of alertness. Solving problems, thinking through to answers. Trusting your mind to tell you what to do. Tyra looked around and shook her head. This is where she was in life right now. Fighting to survive a virus that has compromised her work environment. She honestly couldn't say that she didn't know that it might happen. A lot of NDAs came with getting the job. Here she was, alive for now, and if she made it out alive later, getting any kind of lawyer against the company would be useless. Suing for billions of dollars was a sight this company saw before it even established its name. Tyra went through a couple of cubicles until she found a few Lysol cans. She handed two to Miranda, who had found her purse and was now flicking a stubborn lighter at the end of a Pall Mall blue. Tyra watched as that stick turned to a line of ash within seconds, causing Miranda to light up another. 

“Do you have anything for yourself? Like, you know, if we die?” I was standing next to Mr. Ronnie, who towered over Tyra by feet. 

Mr. Ronnie sighed, “I want to read the ending to ‘The Black Farm’ by Elias Witherow. The way the author of this story is more than captivating; it has me on every hook, and going deeper into the story with his imagination and creations is far beyond unique and so special all in itself. I want to know how the first book ends.” Mr. Ronnie scratched his silver beard and let out one more deep sigh. 

“Do you have your phone, or I bet I can find an iPad, let's get a digital copy and finish it now.” The suggestion was worth a shot to bring comfort to the most tragic situation possible. 

“I have my phone. It’s charged.” Mr. Ronnie dug into his back pocket and pulled out the touchscreen tablet. 

“I don't think they would have messed with the WiFi since it’s encrypted with a bunch of security firewalls all the way through the entire network, but there are some sites online that you are able to search and use.” I took Mr. Ronnie’s phone, opened Chrome, and typed my question into Google. 

“Here.” I handed back his phone with a digital copy of the book on screen. 

Mr. Ronnie shook his head in disbelief. “Well, I am going to find somewhere to sit for a minute.” Mr. Ronnie, gazing at his phone, walked away from Tyra, leaving her alone with the smoking chimney shaking with tremors beside her. 

“You got anything other than cigarettes in there?” Tyra needed something to get her mind clear before executing the dumbest plan of her life. 

Miranda’s eyes locked with Tyra’s for a moment as she studied her deeply before answering her question. “Listen, I don't know you very well, and I am obsessed with first impressions, but right now I don't give a fuck about all that.” Miranda laughed wildly for a moment as a sense of liberation fed her for the first time. “I was saving this for the roof later, I work until 1:00am, I was gonna take a few minutes, smoke a quick cigarette, and then light up a joint.” Miranda dug through her purse and opened up a tin cigarette case, which was half empty and had a tobacco leaf rolled into a miniature cigar. 

God continued to bless Tyra, and for a few minutes, she felt really optimistic about everything happening around her, and for a moment, she knew things were just going to keep falling into place. The thin, short cigar smelled sweet, and as Miranda lit it, memories of sitting on Tyra’s coach, caught up writing some stupid story she was going to post online, and smoking so much weed. Her life was wrapped in a paradise that, if people knew the true extent of her livelihood, envy would be the least of their problems. Her life. Tyra wanted to go back to her life. Tyra took the joint and took a deep inhale before allowing the smoke to leisurely leave her lips. Tyra lived in a 500,000-dollar house with a bunch of dogs and too many art rooms. The way she can afford this style of living is a secret she would never tell. BANG. BANG. BANG. It snapped us all back to reality. Knock. Knock. Knock. 

“We just want to talk to you.” It was a woman this time with a voice of motherly love. “Nothing harmful will be done, and nothing scary is going to happen. We just want to sit down together and maybe learn things from one another.” Its raspy voice was a screech I couldn't endure. “We are all waiting on you.” She lured. 

“How many of you are out there?” Mr. Ronnie asked the creation. 

“Many, too many, not enough.” It chuckled with almost a deep growl. 

“I don't think there are too many of them out there.” Mr. Ronnie was long past wanting to know the ending, and he was jolting into action. “Let's just do this.” 

“Okay, okay, what if there is a horde?”” So many questions were running through Tyra, and it felt like she was going to vomit. She just really needed a Klonopin right now, thinking that releasing some of the anxiety in her body would help her focus more on the dire situation in front of them.  

“Just open the doors and step back. Let them come in. If they enter slowly, do your best to hide behind the door until there is a passage to slip through. If they come out fast, well then we just let them through and fight off the rest.” Mr. Ronnie was laying out the plan, making sure that everyone understood what was about to happen.

The knocking turned violent, shifting to a pounding that shook the barricades. Everyone carried and shoved the last desks and cabinets from the door that led to the stairs. Tyra prayed to God that they weren't about to face a wall of flesh and bone.

The thumping grew louder. Louder. The anger behind it was practically physical, filling the air with desperation.

Mr. Ronnie threw the exit open.

Three bodies flew in at once, tumbling and stumbling over each other, jerking wildly as if trapped inside their skin. Arms flailed for purchase. Limbs hit the floor and scrambled. Grotesque shapes struggled to hold together, stretching out to form something that could stand.

Mr. Ronnie grabbed Tyra by the waist, pulling her back from the fleshy mess still writhing together.

Fists flew. He punched and kicked his way through the mob like a man who had been fighting forever.

Behind him, Miranda and Tyra unleashed sprays of fire from their makeshift flamethrowers. Hissing and whoosh of burning aerosol cut through the chaos. The creations shrank back from the heat. Acrid smoke filled the air, stinging eyes and throats.

Mr. Ronnie barreled down the stairs without hesitation. Miranda tripped and crashed, sprawling across the steps, and Tyra stumbled over Miranda’s legs. They scrambled back up, panicking, making everything blur as they pressed on behind Mr. Ronnie, desperate to keep moving.

They could hear the creations slowly running down from upstairs, and the groans of the incapacitated returning to animation. Tyra threw Miranda off her body and got up as quickly as she could, not looking back twice as she sprinted down after Mr. Ronnie. The scream that came from Miranda’s anguish made Tyra’s legs pump faster than ever before. Then she hit a rock wall and fell back, almost losing her balance. Gaining her composure, she was relieved and happy to see that she had just run into Mr. Ronnie. She watched as Mr. Ronnie glared out the small window on the door. He stepped back and made the decision so fast that Tyra could only hang on and fly along. She could hear the rapid footsteps and see the beings in front of her contouring and shifting into odd shapes. 

It was like watching someone get rearranged from the inside as Tyra watched bones shift and break under the elastic skin. Little spore boils came and went radically all over their flesh. The way their necks jerked and cracked with a wet crunch was unsettling, and even more so when the necks disintegrated altogether and hung limp, upside down. Mr. Ronnie had my waist in his vice grip, and he was running so fast the things around us sometimes blurred in and out of focus. They got to the front door, and Mr. Ronnie put Tyra down and pulled out his gun. There was no time for explanations or any sort of thinking. There was only time for action. Mr. Ronnie put every bullet he had into the locking mechanism on the door. Tyra covered her ears, and her heart was about to burst from too much adrenaline as the creations got closer and closer. After using all his rounds, he began using his huge body to break through the door. Tyra stepped back, watching every sequence of events unfold to her in slow motion. Tyra backed away as quickly as she could as they could almost reach her. 

Mr. Ronnie pushed the door open and flew out the front. He took a hard left, and he didn't stop running until he and Tyra were at his car in the parking garage. 

“We let them out.” Tyra was shaking with so much emotion her body couldn't help but to tread back and forth in a straight line. 

Mr. Ronnie grabbed her shoulders and, with a stern voice, he spoke, “I am going to take you to your car. We were never here, and we were never a part of this.” His voice was stern, and the grip he had on Tyra’s shoulders was tight. 

Tyra nodded her head as she understood and got into Mr. Ronnie’s spotless SUV. Tyra got an executive spot near the front door, which was clear of any abomination. Mr. Ronnie escorted Tyra to her car and then waited for her to start the engine and drive off before leaving. Tyra was in a daze as her body took over, her muscle memory guiding her just where to go. Tyra parked her car and looked at herself in the mirror. To say she looked frazzled was an understatement. She smoothed herself down as best she could, then fixed her smudged makeup with the foundation hidden in the middle console, just for times like this. She got herself together, and then she walked up to her front door and went inside. 

“Hey, I have been waiting for you for hours. A little text saying you were going to be late wouldn't have been a hard gesture.” Adam came to her and helped her shrug out of her coat. He hung it up and embraced Tyra before looking at her. “Did you have a rough day?” He could see the stress and perplexity on Tyra’s face. 

“I will have to find a new job; things weren’t really working out with that company.” Tyra cleared her throat and walked into her kitchen. She grabbed a wine glass out of her cupboard and poured herself a heavy bit of scarlet wine. She took a long, hard sip and looked at Adam. 

He was the man she loved. Perfect for her in everyway and coming close to a torturous death that no one could understand has really made Tyra look at him differently. She noticed his long black hair had been cut recently; it was still crisp and adoring. His scruff was always there; Tyra could always feel it against her face and neck. It was a tickle that she came to deeply adore. He carried a scent of cedar, mint, and musk that gave Tyra life every time she inhaled its sweet aroma. She almost lost all of that. 

“I need a few minutes to process a couple of weird things that happened at work, and I'm just gonna take a hot shower and release some stress.” Tyra kissed Adam hard on the lips before disappearing to her bathroom. Tyra gripped the porcelain sink until her knuckles went white and she stared at herself in the mirror. What had she just survived, and what the fuck was going to happen now? That experiment was loose upon the population, and spreading doesn't seem to be one of its concerns. Tyra started the shower and got in, fully clothed, makeup and all. She didn't even bother trying to warm herself. She silently cried as her heart came to a steady rhythm. She couldn't say anything about this, and she knew that when this species starts to grow in population, shit is going to get scary. It was Tyra who let them out. ",1,1770920436.0,Nonsleep,0,1.0,False
1r310zy,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1r310zy/scared/,Scared,"I don't know what makes you think I would ever walk away from this now it's started. I don't know why you've looked at me and thought that I ever give up that easily. I don't want to give you up, so I shan't. Not sure yet what that'll look like from a practical perspective, but it's more exciting that way anyway.

It isn't that I don't get it, it's that you're simply worthwhile. You're worth it, at least to me, the soul I read about with my morning coffee, that speaks to me across time and space even as the circumstances of life continue to work against us.

There's a peace in knowing that some things are inevitable. Like the eventual collision of our faces, or an all-encompassing hug at the end of a very long day. To know that, no matter how much time passes, there's a safe place to return to, someone to stretch the knots out of your back and hold you gently, as I can. Someone to hold you whilst you fall asleep, to watch the lines on your face change with time and the gentleness only two souls in love can understand.

I've taken enough from the world before, I can take it all again if I have to. But i have my own dreams, my own wants, my own plans for the future, and they all feel a lot more possible knowing how much you make my heart sing. Nothing could ever protect me from everything, it's on myself to handle it - and for the right person (you) I'd do that. But also because at some point, you have to stop pretending that you're not scared.

I am. I'm scared of it all.

But I'm done with hiding behind my hair and pretending it all just goes away if I push it. It doesn't, it just burns brighter, brighter and brighter until I can't ignore it.

So I'll do it scared. I'll love you scared, and that doesn't come with an opt-out clause. That's forever, but the kind of forever that's also an agreement that life comes with ups and downs and it's more about working *through* than out.

There's nothing you could bring me that I wouldn't accept, because it's you, and when you love someone you take them exactly as they are. You're foolish to think otherwise.

There's nothing you could throw at me that I couldn't handle, even if it takes me a little while to adjust. My heart betrays me; I really don't think I *can* live without you now I know you. It's not about closeness, simple closeness could never be enough to satiate how this makes me feel, the desperation in my chest when I think you're slipping away.

So there's nothing you can do. It's going to happen.

I'll do it scared. I'll do it anyway.",3,1770920405.0,letters,1,1.0,False

RANT: I love critiques but it burns my nerve endings when someone over analyzes everything that’s wrong with it. Cool dude, just say you didn't like it. Just be nice, don't be a douche, that’s all. Thanks for reading. You are the best.

She wanted her grandmother. She ached for that warm embrace of protection and security, but all she had was the hard, metallic chill pressing against her skull. Dust and the chemical tang of the lab air filled her nose. She didn't know how everything had ended up like this. Drawing her knees in, she squeezed her eyes shut and pressed the back of her head to the slick, cold surface of the filing cabinet. The faint hum of lights pulsed overhead, masked by the thudding in her chest. The press of the metal reminded her she wasn't even working in the sub-sections—her office was one floor up from the basement, close to the sub-sections but not quite there. Each breath caught in her throat, deep and shaky, making her chest feel tight. She forced herself to turn her head, heart hammering, and glanced behind the cabinet. Movement snagged her vision: one of the creations marching over the tiles, its black, simmering frame sliding into a fresh cadaver. Her stomach lurched as its spire-shaped head snapped upward through the man's cranium, the wet crack sharp and too close. Panic closed in. They wanted to be like us; they wanted to be us. Smart men across the world got together and created artificial intelligence made of organic matter, endowing it with free will. What the fuck did they think was going to happen to everyone? Especially when everything was already controlled and manipulated with AI. She wiped her tears away, but her hands shook, and her sleeve smeared the glob of snot that had slipped from her sniveling nostrils. She realized too late she hadn’t brought a scrunchie; her mahogany hair, usually smooth and curly, was now a wild mess of frizz and tangles around her face. Her eyes burned, vision blurring from tears and exhaustion. Blood pulsed in her ears. Forcing slow, ragged breaths, she steadied herself, pushing off the cabinet. Her legs trembled as she stumbled upright. Without looking back, she hurtled toward the emergency exit, adrenaline drowning out pain and reason. The beast moved too slowly for her incredible burst of desperation, and she slammed through the door, tripping so hard she tumbled down an entire flight of stairs before scrambling to get back up.

She took the stairs up two or three at a time. She was close to getting up the five flights she needed to go up before reaching the lobby that led her to the front door. She burst open the stairwell door and ran right into one of their security guys. Mr. Larry, right now, was calmer than he needed to be. His demeanor, in fact, was slack and bubbly. She looked at him, perplexed, then noticed his skin. His flesh rippled and fluttered so quickly under the surface it looked like he was boiling, as if something inside him was trying to break free. She couldn't tear her eyes away from the uncanny motion—skin shifting, unsettled and alive.

“Hiya there Tyra.” Mr. Larry’s dark, honey-brown brow was also wiggling as if his veins had come alive and were dancing under the muscles around his skull. 

“Nope,” was all she managed to say before twirling around and bolting back through the stairwell door and sprinting up further into the building. 

These beasts, the aliens, whatever you want to name them, are fast when they are not draped in a human body. They seek the internal warmth of every soul's radiation. They squat their tall, thin bodies, and with two spires for arms, reach into the back, snap the spine, and pry it open. Then they push their spire-ended legs through the man as if he were putting on a pair of pants, then it would pull up the top and meld the back seam together with some kind of fleshy goo. The creations didn't take the host well, to say the least. The infection begins to spike and boil as its skin flutters frantically across the body. 

She ran up two more flights of stairs before rushing into the fourth-floor offices. On her arrival, she was caught immediately by a vice grip, and she could not help the blood-curdling screams that belted from her body. Her captor let her settle down before placing her back on her feet. 

“Mr. Ronnie? Miranda”? She asked breathlessly, trying to get her stammering heart under control. 

“Where did you come from”? My other security guard asked. 

“Lobby”. Looking around the room, the only available exit was through the shatterproof windows. 

“We were there too.” Miranda was hugging her tiny shoulders with one arm and absentmindedly twirling a strand of her blonde hair into a curl. 

“How is the gun?” Tyra noticed the assigned pistol he was given upon receiving the job. 

Mr. Ronnie pulled his weapon out of its holster, wrinkled his dark chestnut face into a furrowed brow, and shook his head. “Doesn't do a damn thing”. You could hear the exasperation in his tone. 

Tyra watched Mr. Ronnie wipe his forehead, a foreboding sign of exasperation and defeat.

“Ooopen the door.” The mutant told on itself with its raspy inhale at the end of each word. It was a sound close to animalistic, but in a different way, more predatory. “Open the door.” It cooed at us with temptation, each and every syllable starved and beckoning. 

The voice made Tyra feel a certain way, with every muscle in her body becoming lax and too pliable. Through a daze, she even found herself moving; she was shifting towards the door, towards the tune of the man's voice. Mr. Ronnie snatched me up so fast, and Miranda smacked her in the face.

Suing for billions of dollars was a sight this company saw before it even established its name. Tyra went through a couple of cubicles until she found a few Lysol cans. She handed two to Miranda, who had found her purse and was now flicking a stubborn lighter at the end of a Pall Mall blue. Tyra watched as that stick turned to a line of ash within seconds, causing Miranda to light up another. 

“Do you have anything for yourself? Like, you know, if we die?” I was standing next to Mr. Ronnie, who towered over Tyra by feet. 

Mr. Ronnie sighed, “I want to read the ending to ‘The Black Farm’ by Elias Witherow. The way the author of this story is more than captivating; it has me on every hook, and going deeper into the story with his imagination and creations is far beyond unique and so special all in itself. I want to know how the first book ends.” Mr. Ronnie scratched his silver beard and let out one more deep sigh. 

“Do you have your phone, or I bet I can find an iPad, let's get a digital copy and finish it now.” The suggestion was worth a shot to bring comfort to the most tragic situation possible. 

“I have my phone. It’s charged.” Mr. Ronnie dug into his back pocket and pulled out the touchscreen tablet. 

“I don't think they would have messed with the WiFi since it’s encrypted with a bunch of security firewalls all the way through the entire network, but there are some sites online that you are able to search and use.” I took Mr. Ronnie’s phone, opened Chrome, and typed my question into Google. 

“Here.” I handed back his phone with a digital copy of the book on screen. 

Mr. Ronnie shook his head in disbelief. “Well, I am going to find somewhere to sit for a minute.” Mr. Ronnie, gazing at his phone, walked away from Tyra, leaving her alone with the smoking chimney shaking with tremors beside her. 

“You got anything other than cigarettes in there?” Tyra needed something to get her mind clear before executing the dumbest plan of her life. 

Miranda’s eyes locked with Tyra’s for a moment as she studied her deeply before answering her question. “Listen, I don't know you very well, and I am obsessed with first impressions, but right now I don't give a fuck about all that.” Miranda laughed wildly for a moment as a sense of liberation fed her for the first time. “I was saving this for the roof later, I work until 1:00am, I was gonna take a few minutes, smoke a quick cigarette, and then light up a joint.” Miranda dug through her purse and opened up a tin cigarette case, which was half empty and had a tobacco leaf rolled into a miniature cigar. 

God continued to bless Tyra, and for a few minutes, she felt really optimistic about everything happening around her, and for a moment, she knew things were just going to keep falling into place. The thin, short cigar smelled sweet, and as Miranda lit it, memories of sitting on Tyra’s coach, caught up writing some stupid story she was going to post online, and smoking so much weed. Her life was wrapped in a paradise that, if people knew the true extent of her livelihood, envy would be the least of their problems. Her life. Tyra wanted to go back to her life. Tyra took the joint and took a deep inhale before allowing the smoke to leisurely leave her lips. Tyra lived in a 500,000-dollar house with a bunch of dogs and too many art rooms. The way she can afford this style of living is a secret she would never tell. BANG. BANG. BANG. It snapped us all back to reality. Knock. Knock. Knock. 

“We just want to talk to you.” It was a woman this time with a voice of motherly love. “Nothing harmful will be done, and nothing scary is going to happen. We just want to sit down together and maybe learn things from one another.” Its raspy voice was a screech I couldn't endure. “We are all waiting on you.” She lured. 

“How many of you are out there?” Mr. Ronnie asked the creation. 

“Many, too many, not enough.” It chuckled with almost a deep growl. 

“I don't think there are too many of them out there.” Mr. Ronnie was long past wanting to know the ending, and he was jolting into action. “Let's just do this.” 

“Okay, okay, what if there is a horde?”” So many questions were running through Tyra, and it felt like she was going to vomit. She just really needed a Klonopin right now, thinking that releasing some of the anxiety in her body would help her focus more on the dire situation in front of them.  

“Just open the doors and step back. Let them come in. If they enter slowly, do your best to hide behind the door until there is a passage to slip through. If they come out fast, well then we just let them through and fight off the rest.” Mr. Ronnie was laying out the plan, making sure that everyone understood what was about to happen.

The knocking turned violent, shifting to a pounding that shook the barricades. Everyone carried and shoved the last desks and cabinets from the door that led to the stairs. Tyra prayed to God that they weren't about to face a wall of flesh and bone.

The thumping grew louder. Louder. The anger behind it was practically physical, filling the air with desperation.

Mr. Ronnie threw the exit open.

Three bodies flew in at once, tumbling and stumbling over each other, jerking wildly as if trapped inside their skin. Arms flailed for purchase. Limbs hit the floor and scrambled. Grotesque shapes struggled to hold together, stretching out to form something that could stand.

Mr. Ronnie grabbed Tyra by the waist, pulling her back from the fleshy mess still writhing together.

Fists flew. He punched and kicked his way through the mob like a man who had been fighting forever.

Behind him, Miranda and Tyra unleashed sprays of fire from their makeshift flamethrowers. Hissing and whoosh of burning aerosol cut through the chaos. The creations shrank back from the heat. Acrid smoke filled the air, stinging eyes and throats.

Mr. Ronnie barreled down the stairs without hesitation. Miranda tripped and crashed, sprawling across the steps, and Tyra stumbled over Miranda’s legs. They scrambled back up, panicking, making everything blur as they pressed on behind Mr. Ronnie, desperate to keep moving.

They could hear the creations slowly running down from upstairs, and the groans of the incapacitated returning to animation. Tyra threw Miranda off her body and got up as quickly as she could, not looking back twice as she sprinted down after Mr. Ronnie. The scream that came from Miranda’s anguish made Tyra’s legs pump faster than ever before. Then she hit a rock wall and fell back, almost losing her balance. Gaining her composure, she was relieved and happy to see that she had just run into Mr. Ronnie. She watched as Mr. Ronnie glared out the small window on the door. He stepped back and made the decision so fast that Tyra could only hang on and fly along. She could hear the rapid footsteps and see the beings in front of her contouring and shifting into odd shapes. 

It was like watching someone get rearranged from the inside as Tyra watched bones shift and break under the elastic skin. Little spore boils came and went radically all over their flesh. The way their necks jerked and cracked with a wet crunch was unsettling, and even more so when the necks disintegrated altogether and hung limp, upside down. Mr. Ronnie had my waist in his vice grip, and he was running so fast the things around us sometimes blurred in and out of focus. They got to the front door, and Mr. Ronnie put Tyra down and pulled out his gun. There was no time for explanations or any sort of thinking. There was only time for action. Mr. Ronnie put every bullet he had into the locking mechanism on the door. Tyra covered her ears, and her heart was about to burst from too much adrenaline as the creations got closer and closer. After using all his rounds, he began using his huge body to break through the door. Tyra stepped back, watching every sequence of events unfold to her in slow motion. Tyra backed away as quickly as she could as they could almost reach her. 

Mr. Ronnie pushed the door open and flew out the front. He took a hard left, and he didn't stop running until he and Tyra were at his car in the parking garage. 

“We let them out.” Tyra was shaking with so much emotion her body couldn't help but to tread back and forth in a straight line. 

Mr. Ronnie grabbed her shoulders and, with a stern voice, he spoke, “I am going to take you to your car. We were never here, and we were never a part of this.” His voice was stern, and the grip he had on Tyra’s shoulders was tight. 

Tyra nodded her head as she understood and got into Mr. Ronnie’s spotless SUV. Tyra got an executive spot near the front door, which was clear of any abomination. Mr. Ronnie escorted Tyra to her car and then waited for her to start the engine and drive off before leaving. Tyra was in a daze as her body took over, her muscle memory guiding her just where to go. Tyra parked her car and looked at herself in the mirror. To say she looked frazzled was an understatement. She smoothed herself down as best she could, then fixed her smudged makeup with the foundation hidden in the middle console, just for times like this. She got herself together, and then she walked up to her front door and went inside. 

“Hey, I have been waiting for you for hours. A little text saying you were going to be late wouldn't have been a hard gesture.” Adam came to her and helped her shrug out of her coat. He hung it up and embraced Tyra before looking at her. “Did you have a rough day?” He could see the stress and perplexity on Tyra’s face. 

“I will have to find a new job; things weren’t really working out with that company.” Tyra cleared her throat and walked into her kitchen. She grabbed a wine glass out of her cupboard and poured herself a heavy bit of scarlet wine. She took a long, hard sip and looked at Adam. 

He was the man she loved. Perfect for her in everyway and coming close to a torturous death that no one could understand has really made Tyra look at him differently. She noticed his long black hair had been cut recently; it was still crisp and adoring. His scruff was always there; Tyra could always feel it against her face and neck. It was a tickle that she came to deeply adore. He carried a scent of cedar, mint, and musk that gave Tyra life every time she inhaled its sweet aroma. She almost lost all of that. 

“I need a few minutes to process a couple of weird things that happened at work, and I'm just gonna take a hot shower and release some stress.” Tyra kissed Adam hard on the lips before disappearing to her bathroom. Tyra gripped the porcelain sink until her knuckles went white and she stared at herself in the mirror. What had she just survived, and what the fuck was going to happen now? That experiment was loose upon the population, and spreading doesn't seem to be one of its concerns. Tyra started the shower and got in, fully clothed, makeup and all. She didn't even bother trying to warm herself. She silently cried as her heart came to a steady rhythm. She couldn't say anything about this, and she knew that when this species starts to grow in population, shit is going to get scary. It was Tyra who let them out.

She wanted her grandmother. She ached for that warm embrace of protection and security, but all she had was the hard, metallic chill pressing against her skull. Dust and the chemical tang of the lab air filled her nose. She didn't know how everything had ended up like this. Drawing her knees in, she squeezed her eyes shut and pressed the back of her head to the slick, cold surface of the filing cabinet. The faint hum of lights pulsed overhead, masked by the thudding in her chest. The press of the metal reminded her she wasn't even working in the sub-sections—her office was one floor up from the basement, close to the sub-sections but not quite there. Each breath caught in her throat, deep and shaky, making her chest feel tight. She forced herself to turn her head, heart hammering, and glanced behind the cabinet. Movement snagged her vision: one of the creations marching over the tiles, its black, simmering frame sliding into a fresh cadaver. Her stomach lurched as its spire-shaped head snapped upward through the man's cranium, the wet crack sharp and too close. Panic closed in. They wanted to be like us; they wanted to be us. Smart men across the world got together and created artificial intelligence made of organic matter, endowing it with free will. What the fuck did they think was going to happen to everyone? Especially when everything was already controlled and manipulated with AI. She wiped her tears away, but her hands shook, and her sleeve smeared the glob of snot that had slipped from her sniveling nostrils. She realized too late she hadn’t brought a scrunchie; her mahogany hair, usually smooth and curly, was now a wild mess of frizz and tangles around her face. Her eyes burned, vision blurring from tears and exhaustion. Blood pulsed in her ears. Forcing slow, ragged breaths, she steadied herself, pushing off the cabinet. Her legs trembled as she stumbled upright. Without looking back, she hurtled toward the emergency exit, adrenaline drowning out pain and reason. The beast moved too slowly for her incredible burst of desperation, and she slammed through the door, tripping so hard she tumbled down an entire flight of stairs before scrambling to get back up.

She took the stairs up two or three at a time. She was close to getting up the five flights she needed to go up before reaching the lobby that led her to the front door. She burst open the stairwell door and ran right into one of their security guys. Mr. Larry, right now, was calmer than he needed to be. His demeanor, in fact, was slack and bubbly. She looked at him, perplexed, then noticed his skin. His flesh rippled and fluttered so quickly under the surface it looked like he was boiling, as if something inside him was trying to break free. She couldn't tear her eyes away from the uncanny motion—skin shifting, unsettled and alive.

“Hiya there Tyra.” Mr. Larry’s dark, honey-brown brow was also wiggling as if his veins had come alive and were dancing under the muscles around his skull. 

“Nope,” was all she managed to say before twirling around and bolting back through the stairwell door and sprinting up further into the building. 

These beasts, the aliens, whatever you want to name them, are fast when they are not draped in a human body. They seek the internal warmth of every soul's radiation. They squat their tall, thin bodies, and with two spires for arms, reach into the back, snap the spine, and pry it open. Then they push their spire-ended legs through the man as if he were putting on a pair of pants, then it would pull up the top and meld the back seam together with some kind of fleshy goo. The creations didn't take the host well, to say the least. The infection begins to spike and boil as its skin flutters frantically across the body. 

She ran up two more flights of stairs before rushing into the fourth-floor offices. On her arrival, she was caught immediately by a vice grip, and she could not help the blood-curdling screams that belted from her body. Her captor let her settle down before placing her back on her feet. 

“Mr. Ronnie? Miranda”? She asked breathlessly, trying to get her stammering heart under control. 

“Where did you come from”? My other security guard asked. 

“Lobby”. Looking around the room, the only available exit was through the shatterproof windows. 

“We were there too.” Miranda was hugging her tiny shoulders with one arm and absentmindedly twirling a strand of her blonde hair into a curl. 

“How is the gun?” Tyra noticed the assigned pistol he was given upon receiving the job. 

Mr. Ronnie pulled his weapon out of its holster, wrinkled his dark chestnut face into a furrowed brow, and shook his head. “Doesn't do a damn thing”. You could hear the exasperation in his tone. 

Tyra watched Mr. Ronnie wipe his forehead, a foreboding sign of exasperation and defeat. 

“Who else is… Normal”? Asking that question was not what it used to be. In what term was normal actually? To whose standards does it declare what is normal and what is not? But we are in a whole new reality, and we just wanted fucking normal. 

“We have stayed hunkered down here for the most part.” Mr. Ronnie motioned to the multiple barricades he had set up around the entire floor. 

“What are we going to do”? Seeing Miranda's lip quiver just let hope flee from Tyra’s soul. What were they going to do? 

They all sat in a pondering silence, waiting for some epiphany to hit them like a bullet at any minute now, some kind of revelation that would reveal their escape. Then it came. Not a flash of understanding, but a sound. Soft, at first. 

Knock.

A single, hollow tap, almost like it could be ignored.

Knock. Knock.

Another. Louder. The rhythm began to pulse through the floor, climbing the walls, filling the stale, waiting air. 

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Each blow was slower than the one before, stretching time, squeezing silence out of every crack. The knock, knock, knock was nonsalutary and unheating; even the voice that came after was a comfort you shouldn't feel from a stranger. The sweet allure of some desperate man in need of some help.

“Ooopen the door.” The mutant told on itself with its raspy inhale at the end of each word. It was a sound close to animalistic, but in a different way, more predatory. “Open the door.” It cooed at us with temptation, each and every syllable starved and beckoning. 

The voice made Tyra feel a certain way, with every muscle in her body becoming lax and too pliable. Through a daze, she even found herself moving; she was shifting towards the door, towards the tune of the man's voice. Mr. Ronnie snatched me up so fast, and Miranda smacked her in the face. 

“Don’t fall for it.” Mr. Ronnie was grave. “You need to stay alert.” 

Tyra listened as desperation crawled into their calls. More and more voices and moans erupted from the other side of every barricade. Tyra pondered on how they haven’t been able to break through yet, and it dawned on her that they must only possess the strength of whoever they are wearing. They were not strong by nature, so a compatible host would be formidable and tough. It was such a wonder how all of this got started.

Snippets of classified memos flickered through Tyra’s memory, old phrases from glowing screens or security briefings: ""Projects on sub-level two strictly compartmentalized."" ""All weekly updates sent directly to High Clearance Only."" Even in the chaos, she caught herself remembering warnings never to share research outside secure channels. Each promotion brought thicker NDA stacks and more paperwork stamped confidential. She remembered rumors exchanged in coffee lines—just idle speculation about scientists trying to invent a new race, part machine, part organism. Everyone, Tyra included, dismissed it as mad science, like some group was trying to play god. But now, those weekly newsletters and the constant reminder that ""the further down you go, the fewer questions you ask"" pressed hard on her mind. This was past the AI that had begun the avalanche; now, they were hunted, just hosts for parasites born of secrets nobody was ever supposed to know.

The BANG BANG BANG was a repeated melody rattling through Tyra’s skull. Even when everything fell silent, there was still the BANG BANG BANG. Her heart was revving like a race car tearing through the track at a million miles per hour. Then there was the laughter. An echoing cry that sounded both wounded and malicious. Miranda was running a path in the carpet, with her circling around and around. She didn't have any more fingernails to chew, and at this point, one could only assume she was now breaking skin. Tyra was just numb with fear and perplexity, not knowing what to do next, not knowing how to get out safely. She wasn't trained for any kind of physical altercation. She was just a doctor in a highly prestigious lab. She had no defense. Mr. Ronnie was big, though, maybe the biggest man they had in the building. Tyra certainly couldn't fight through the horde outside the doors, but he sure as fuck could fight past them while Tyra and Miranda use any weapon they can find to help clear the path. Then they needed to go down.

“Any ideas on how to kill it? Hurt it? Incapacitate it?”

I was digging, begging god for answers. The words hung in the air, unfinished, swallowed by the thudding in my chest...

“What is there to even use? We are in a damn office. What am I gonna do, staple them to death?” Miranda was frantic and becoming more manic with fear by the second. 

“Burning it might be an answer.” Tyra was just thinking of any way to get them through the mob as safely as possible. 

“What would we use to make fire?” Miranda was sarcastic and uninterested, now consumed by a coming fate that had no escape. It was a heavy realization. 

“I have a lighter.” Mr. Ronnie is in for the win. 

“I have a couple of lighters in my purse and a carton of cigarettes that are screaming my name.” Mirianda needed more than a cigarette; she needed some damn Xanax. 

“I bet there are aerosol cans, disinfecting spray, a whole lotta shit that has butane.” Blessed by God, she knew how to set fires with just about anything; it was once an unstable practice of hers. 

“Okay, we have fire. Now what?” Mr. Ronnie gripped his hips tightly and slowly rocked back and forth from his heels. 

“Okay. We use Mr. Ronnie as the tank; he will lead us on the front lines, armed with his weapon of choice. Then Miranda and I will use fire to keep them at bay while we can make a run past them.” The suggestion was weak, but it was the only one anyone could come up with in this panicked situation. 

Tyra always found it odd that, in states of great stress, a mind shuts itself down to protect itself from nerve damage, when, in fact, it should be at its highest point of alertness. Solving problems, thinking through to answers. Trusting your mind to tell you what to do. Tyra looked around and shook her head. This is where she was in life right now. Fighting to survive a virus that has compromised her work environment. She honestly couldn't say that she didn't know that it might happen. A lot of NDAs came with getting the job. Here she was, alive for now, and if she made it out alive later, getting any kind of lawyer against the company would be useless. Suing for billions of dollars was a sight this company saw before it even established its name. Tyra went through a couple of cubicles until she found a few Lysol cans. She handed two to Miranda, who had found her purse and was now flicking a stubborn lighter at the end of a Pall Mall blue. Tyra watched as that stick turned to a line of ash within seconds, causing Miranda to light up another. 

“Do you have anything for yourself? Like, you know, if we die?” I was standing next to Mr. Ronnie, who towered over Tyra by feet. 

Mr. Ronnie sighed, “I want to read the ending to ‘The Black Farm’ by Elias Witherow. The way the author of this story is more than captivating; it has me on every hook, and going deeper into the story with his imagination and creations is far beyond unique and so special all in itself. I want to know how the first book ends.” Mr. Ronnie scratched his silver beard and let out one more deep sigh. 

“Do you have your phone, or I bet I can find an iPad, let's get a digital copy and finish it now.” The suggestion was worth a shot to bring comfort to the most tragic situation possible. 

“I have my phone. It’s charged.” Mr. Ronnie dug into his back pocket and pulled out the touchscreen tablet. 

“I don't think they would have messed with the WiFi since it’s encrypted with a bunch of security firewalls all the way through the entire network, but there are some sites online that you are able to search and use.” I took Mr. Ronnie’s phone, opened Chrome, and typed my question into Google.

“Just open the doors and step back. Let them come in. If they enter slowly, do your best to hide behind the door until there is a passage to slip through.

“I will have to find a new job; things weren’t really working out with that company.” Tyra cleared her throat and walked into her kitchen. She grabbed a wine glass out of her cupboard and poured herself a heavy bit of scarlet wine. She took a long, hard sip and looked at Adam. 

He was the man she loved. Perfect for her in everyway and coming close to a torturous death that no one could understand has really made Tyra look at him differently. She noticed his long black hair had been cut recently; it was still crisp and adoring. His scruff was always there; Tyra could always feel it against her face and neck. It was a tickle that she came to deeply adore. He carried a scent of cedar, mint, and musk that gave Tyra life every time she inhaled its sweet aroma. She almost lost all of that. 

“I need a few minutes to process a couple of weird things that happened at work, and I'm just gonna take a hot shower and release some stress.” Tyra kissed Adam hard on the lips before disappearing to her bathroom. Tyra gripped the porcelain sink until her knuckles went white and she stared at herself in the mirror. What had she just survived, and what the fuck was going to happen now? That experiment was loose upon the population, and spreading doesn't seem to be one of its concerns. Tyra started the shower and got in, fully clothed, makeup and all. She didn't even bother trying to warm herself. She silently cried as her heart came to a steady rhythm. She couldn't say anything about this, and she knew that when this species starts to grow in population, shit is going to get scary. It was Tyra who let them out.

1r30zy7,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheCreeps/comments/1r30zy7/they_put_you_on/,They Put You On,"I do mention ‘Elias Witherow’ in this story, along with his book The Black Farm. I give him credit in the story in very positive ways. 

RANT: I love critiques but it burns my nerve endings when someone over analyzes everything that’s wrong with it. Cool dude, just say you didn't like it. Just be nice, don't be a douche, that’s all. Thanks for reading. You are the best.

She wanted her grandmother. She ached for that warm embrace of protection and security, but all she had was the hard, metallic chill pressing against her skull. Dust and the chemical tang of the lab air filled her nose. She didn't know how everything had ended up like this. Drawing her knees in, she squeezed her eyes shut and pressed the back of her head to the slick, cold surface of the filing cabinet. The faint hum of lights pulsed overhead, masked by the thudding in her chest. The press of the metal reminded her she wasn't even working in the sub-sections—her office was one floor up from the basement, close to the sub-sections but not quite there. Each breath caught in her throat, deep and shaky, making her chest feel tight. She forced herself to turn her head, heart hammering, and glanced behind the cabinet. Movement snagged her vision: one of the creations marching over the tiles, its black, simmering frame sliding into a fresh cadaver. Her stomach lurched as its spire-shaped head snapped upward through the man's cranium, the wet crack sharp and too close. Panic closed in. They wanted to be like us; they wanted to be us. Smart men across the world got together and created artificial intelligence made of organic matter, endowing it with free will. What the fuck did they think was going to happen to everyone? Especially when everything was already controlled and manipulated with AI. She wiped her tears away, but her hands shook, and her sleeve smeared the glob of snot that had slipped from her sniveling nostrils. She realized too late she hadn’t brought a scrunchie; her mahogany hair, usually smooth and curly, was now a wild mess of frizz and tangles around her face. Her eyes burned, vision blurring from tears and exhaustion. Blood pulsed in her ears. Forcing slow, ragged breaths, she steadied herself, pushing off the cabinet. Her legs trembled as she stumbled upright. Without looking back, she hurtled toward the emergency exit, adrenaline drowning out pain and reason. The beast moved too slowly for her incredible burst of desperation, and she slammed through the door, tripping so hard she tumbled down an entire flight of stairs before scrambling to get back up.

She took the stairs up two or three at a time. She was close to getting up the five flights she needed to go up before reaching the lobby that led her to the front door. She burst open the stairwell door and ran right into one of their security guys. Mr. Larry, right now, was calmer than he needed to be. His demeanor, in fact, was slack and bubbly. She looked at him, perplexed, then noticed his skin. His flesh rippled and fluttered so quickly under the surface it looked like he was boiling, as if something inside him was trying to break free. She couldn't tear her eyes away from the uncanny motion—skin shifting, unsettled and alive.

“Hiya there Tyra.” Mr. Larry’s dark, honey-brown brow was also wiggling as if his veins had come alive and were dancing under the muscles around his skull. 

“Nope,” was all she managed to say before twirling around and bolting back through the stairwell door and sprinting up further into the building. 

These beasts, the aliens, whatever you want to name them, are fast when they are not draped in a human body. They seek the internal warmth of every soul's radiation. They squat their tall, thin bodies, and with two spires for arms, reach into the back, snap the spine, and pry it open. Then they push their spire-ended legs through the man as if he were putting on a pair of pants, then it would pull up the top and meld the back seam together with some kind of fleshy goo. The creations didn't take the host well, to say the least. The infection begins to spike and boil as its skin flutters frantically across the body. 

She ran up two more flights of stairs before rushing into the fourth-floor offices. On her arrival, she was caught immediately by a vice grip, and she could not help the blood-curdling screams that belted from her body. Her captor let her settle down before placing her back on her feet. 

“Mr. Ronnie? Miranda”? She asked breathlessly, trying to get her stammering heart under control. 

“Where did you come from”? My other security guard asked. 

“Lobby”. Looking around the room, the only available exit was through the shatterproof windows. 

“We were there too.” Miranda was hugging her tiny shoulders with one arm and absentmindedly twirling a strand of her blonde hair into a curl. 

“How is the gun?” Tyra noticed the assigned pistol he was given upon receiving the job. 

Mr. Ronnie pulled his weapon out of its holster, wrinkled his dark chestnut face into a furrowed brow, and shook his head. “Doesn't do a damn thing”. You could hear the exasperation in his tone. 

Tyra watched Mr. Ronnie wipe his forehead, a foreboding sign of exasperation and defeat. 

“Who else is… Normal”? Asking that question was not what it used to be. In what term was normal actually? To whose standards does it declare what is normal and what is not? But we are in a whole new reality, and we just wanted fucking normal. 

“We have stayed hunkered down here for the most part.” Mr. Ronnie motioned to the multiple barricades he had set up around the entire floor. 

“What are we going to do”? Seeing Miranda's lip quiver just let hope flee from Tyra’s soul. What were they going to do? 

They all sat in a pondering silence, waiting for some epiphany to hit them like a bullet at any minute now, some kind of revelation that would reveal their escape. Then it came. Not a flash of understanding, but a sound. Soft, at first. 

Knock.

A single, hollow tap, almost like it could be ignored.

Knock. Knock.

Another. Louder. The rhythm began to pulse through the floor, climbing the walls, filling the stale, waiting air. 

Knock. Knock. Knock.

Each blow was slower than the one before, stretching time, squeezing silence out of every crack. The knock, knock, knock was nonsalutary and unheating; even the voice that came after was a comfort you shouldn't feel from a stranger. The sweet allure of some desperate man in need of some help.

“Ooopen the door.” The mutant told on itself with its raspy inhale at the end of each word. It was a sound close to animalistic, but in a different way, more predatory. “Open the door.” It cooed at us with temptation, each and every syllable starved and beckoning. 

The voice made Tyra feel a certain way, with every muscle in her body becoming lax and too pliable. Through a daze, she even found herself moving; she was shifting towards the door, towards the tune of the man's voice. Mr. Ronnie snatched me up so fast, and Miranda smacked her in the face. 

“Don’t fall for it.” Mr. Ronnie was grave. “You need to stay alert.” 

Tyra listened as desperation crawled into their calls. More and more voices and moans erupted from the other side of every barricade. Tyra pondered on how they haven’t been able to break through yet, and it dawned on her that they must only possess the strength of whoever they are wearing. They were not strong by nature, so a compatible host would be formidable and tough. It was such a wonder how all of this got started.

Snippets of classified memos flickered through Tyra’s memory, old phrases from glowing screens or security briefings: ""Projects on sub-level two strictly compartmentalized."" ""All weekly updates sent directly to High Clearance Only."" Even in the chaos, she caught herself remembering warnings never to share research outside secure channels. Each promotion brought thicker NDA stacks and more paperwork stamped confidential. She remembered rumors exchanged in coffee lines—just idle speculation about scientists trying to invent a new race, part machine, part organism. Everyone, Tyra included, dismissed it as mad science, like some group was trying to play god. But now, those weekly newsletters and the constant reminder that ""the further down you go, the fewer questions you ask"" pressed hard on her mind. This was past the AI that had begun the avalanche; now, they were hunted, just hosts for parasites born of secrets nobody was ever supposed to know.

The BANG BANG BANG was a repeated melody rattling through Tyra’s skull. Even when everything fell silent, there was still the BANG BANG BANG. Her heart was revving like a race car tearing through the track at a million miles per hour. Then there was the laughter. An echoing cry that sounded both wounded and malicious. Miranda was running a path in the carpet, with her circling around and around. She didn't have any more fingernails to chew, and at this point, one could only assume she was now breaking skin. Tyra was just numb with fear and perplexity, not knowing what to do next, not knowing how to get out safely. She wasn't trained for any kind of physical altercation. She was just a doctor in a highly prestigious lab. She had no defense. Mr. Ronnie was big, though, maybe the biggest man they had in the building. Tyra certainly couldn't fight through the horde outside the doors, but he sure as fuck could fight past them while Tyra and Miranda use any weapon they can find to help clear the path. Then they needed to go down.

“Any ideas on how to kill it? Hurt it? Incapacitate it?”

I was digging, begging god for answers. The words hung in the air, unfinished, swallowed by the thudding in my chest...

“What is there to even use? We are in a damn office. What am I gonna do, staple them to death?” Miranda was frantic and becoming more manic with fear by the second. 

“Burning it might be an answer.” Tyra was just thinking of any way to get them through the mob as safely as possible. 

“What would we use to make fire?” Miranda was sarcastic and uninterested, now consumed by a coming fate that had no escape. It was a heavy realization. 

“I have a lighter.” Mr. Ronnie is in for the win. 

“I have a couple of lighters in my purse and a carton of cigarettes that are screaming my name.” Mirianda needed more than a cigarette; she needed some damn Xanax. 

“I bet there are aerosol cans, disinfecting spray, a whole lotta shit that has butane.” Blessed by God, she knew how to set fires with just about anything; it was once an unstable practice of hers. 

“Okay, we have fire. Now what?” Mr. Ronnie gripped his hips tightly and slowly rocked back and forth from his heels. 

“Okay. We use Mr. Ronnie as the tank; he will lead us on the front lines, armed with his weapon of choice. Then Miranda and I will use fire to keep them at bay while we can make a run past them.” The suggestion was weak, but it was the only one anyone could come up with in this panicked situation. 

Tyra always found it odd that, in states of great stress, a mind shuts itself down to protect itself from nerve damage, when, in fact, it should be at its highest point of alertness. Solving problems, thinking through to answers. Trusting your mind to tell you what to do. Tyra looked around and shook her head. This is where she was in life right now. Fighting to survive a virus that has compromised her work environment. She honestly couldn't say that she didn't know that it might happen. A lot of NDAs came with getting the job. Here she was, alive for now, and if she made it out alive later, getting any kind of lawyer against the company would be useless. Suing for billions of dollars was a sight this company saw before it even established its name. Tyra went through a couple of cubicles until she found a few Lysol cans. She handed two to Miranda, who had found her purse and was now flicking a stubborn lighter at the end of a Pall Mall blue. Tyra watched as that stick turned to a line of ash within seconds, causing Miranda to light up another. 

“Do you have anything for yourself? Like, you know, if we die?” I was standing next to Mr. Ronnie, who towered over Tyra by feet. 

Mr. Ronnie sighed, “I want to read the ending to ‘The Black Farm’ by Elias Witherow. The way the author of this story is more than captivating; it has me on every hook, and going deeper into the story with his imagination and creations is far beyond unique and so special all in itself. I want to know how the first book ends.” Mr. Ronnie scratched his silver beard and let out one more deep sigh. 

“Do you have your phone, or I bet I can find an iPad, let's get a digital copy and finish it now.” The suggestion was worth a shot to bring comfort to the most tragic situation possible. 

“I have my phone. It’s charged.” Mr. Ronnie dug into his back pocket and pulled out the touchscreen tablet. 

“I don't think they would have messed with the WiFi since it’s encrypted with a bunch of security firewalls all the way through the entire network, but there are some sites online that you are able to search and use.” I took Mr. Ronnie’s phone, opened Chrome, and typed my question into Google. 

“Here.” I handed back his phone with a digital copy of the book on screen. 

Mr. Ronnie shook his head in disbelief. “Well, I am going to find somewhere to sit for a minute.” Mr. Ronnie, gazing at his phone, walked away from Tyra, leaving her alone with the smoking chimney shaking with tremors beside her. 

“You got anything other than cigarettes in there?” Tyra needed something to get her mind clear before executing the dumbest plan of her life. 

Miranda’s eyes locked with Tyra’s for a moment as she studied her deeply before answering her question. “Listen, I don't know you very well, and I am obsessed with first impressions, but right now I don't give a fuck about all that.” Miranda laughed wildly for a moment as a sense of liberation fed her for the first time. “I was saving this for the roof later, I work until 1:00am, I was gonna take a few minutes, smoke a quick cigarette, and then light up a joint.” Miranda dug through her purse and opened up a tin cigarette case, which was half empty and had a tobacco leaf rolled into a miniature cigar. 

God continued to bless Tyra, and for a few minutes, she felt really optimistic about everything happening around her, and for a moment, she knew things were just going to keep falling into place. The thin, short cigar smelled sweet, and as Miranda lit it, memories of sitting on Tyra’s coach, caught up writing some stupid story she was going to post online, and smoking so much weed. Her life was wrapped in a paradise that, if people knew the true extent of her livelihood, envy would be the least of their problems. Her life. Tyra wanted to go back to her life. Tyra took the joint and took a deep inhale before allowing the smoke to leisurely leave her lips. Tyra lived in a 500,000-dollar house with a bunch of dogs and too many art rooms. The way she can afford this style of living is a secret she would never tell. BANG. BANG. BANG. It snapped us all back to reality. Knock. Knock. Knock. 

“We just want to talk to you.” It was a woman this time with a voice of motherly love. “Nothing harmful will be done, and nothing scary is going to happen. We just want to sit down together and maybe learn things from one another.” Its raspy voice was a screech I couldn't endure. “We are all waiting on you.” She lured. 

“How many of you are out there?” Mr. Ronnie asked the creation. 

“Many, too many, not enough.” It chuckled with almost a deep growl. 

“I don't think there are too many of them out there.” Mr. Ronnie was long past wanting to know the ending, and he was jolting into action. “Let's just do this.” 

“Okay, okay, what if there is a horde?”” So many questions were running through Tyra, and it felt like she was going to vomit. She just really needed a Klonopin right now, thinking that releasing some of the anxiety in her body would help her focus more on the dire situation in front of them.  

“Just open the doors and step back. Let them come in. If they enter slowly, do your best to hide behind the door until there is a passage to slip through. If they come out fast, well then we just let them through and fight off the rest.” Mr. Ronnie was laying out the plan, making sure that everyone understood what was about to happen.

The knocking turned violent, shifting to a pounding that shook the barricades. Everyone carried and shoved the last desks and cabinets from the door that led to the stairs. Tyra prayed to God that they weren't about to face a wall of flesh and bone.

The thumping grew louder. Louder. The anger behind it was practically physical, filling the air with desperation.

Mr. Ronnie threw the exit open.

Three bodies flew in at once, tumbling and stumbling over each other, jerking wildly as if trapped inside their skin. Arms flailed for purchase. Limbs hit the floor and scrambled. Grotesque shapes struggled to hold together, stretching out to form something that could stand.

Mr. Ronnie grabbed Tyra by the waist, pulling her back from the fleshy mess still writhing together.

Fists flew. He punched and kicked his way through the mob like a man who had been fighting forever.

Behind him, Miranda and Tyra unleashed sprays of fire from their makeshift flamethrowers. Hissing and whoosh of burning aerosol cut through the chaos. The creations shrank back from the heat. Acrid smoke filled the air, stinging eyes and throats.

Mr. Ronnie barreled down the stairs without hesitation. Miranda tripped and crashed, sprawling across the steps, and Tyra stumbled over Miranda’s legs. They scrambled back up, panicking, making everything blur as they pressed on behind Mr. Ronnie, desperate to keep moving.

They could hear the creations slowly running down from upstairs, and the groans of the incapacitated returning to animation. Tyra threw Miranda off her body and got up as quickly as she could, not looking back twice as she sprinted down after Mr. Ronnie. The scream that came from Miranda’s anguish made Tyra’s legs pump faster than ever before. Then she hit a rock wall and fell back, almost losing her balance. Gaining her composure, she was relieved and happy to see that she had just run into Mr. Ronnie. She watched as Mr. Ronnie glared out the small window on the door. He stepped back and made the decision so fast that Tyra could only hang on and fly along. She could hear the rapid footsteps and see the beings in front of her contouring and shifting into odd shapes. 

It was like watching someone get rearranged from the inside as Tyra watched bones shift and break under the elastic skin. Little spore boils came and went radically all over their flesh. The way their necks jerked and cracked with a wet crunch was unsettling, and even more so when the necks disintegrated altogether and hung limp, upside down. Mr. Ronnie had my waist in his vice grip, and he was running so fast the things around us sometimes blurred in and out of focus. They got to the front door, and Mr. Ronnie put Tyra down and pulled out his gun. There was no time for explanations or any sort of thinking. There was only time for action. Mr. Ronnie put every bullet he had into the locking mechanism on the door. Tyra covered her ears, and her heart was about to burst from too much adrenaline as the creations got closer and closer. After using all his rounds, he began using his huge body to break through the door. Tyra stepped back, watching every sequence of events unfold to her in slow motion. Tyra backed away as quickly as she could as they could almost reach her. 

Mr. Ronnie pushed the door open and flew out the front. He took a hard left, and he didn't stop running until he and Tyra were at his car in the parking garage. 

“We let them out.” Tyra was shaking with so much emotion her body couldn't help but to tread back and forth in a straight line. 

Mr. Ronnie grabbed her shoulders and, with a stern voice, he spoke, “I am going to take you to your car. We were never here, and we were never a part of this.” His voice was stern, and the grip he had on Tyra’s shoulders was tight. 

Tyra nodded her head as she understood and got into Mr. Ronnie’s spotless SUV. Tyra got an executive spot near the front door, which was clear of any abomination. Mr. Ronnie escorted Tyra to her car and then waited for her to start the engine and drive off before leaving. Tyra was in a daze as her body took over, her muscle memory guiding her just where to go. Tyra parked her car and looked at herself in the mirror. To say she looked frazzled was an understatement. She smoothed herself down as best she could, then fixed her smudged makeup with the foundation hidden in the middle console, just for times like this. She got herself together, and then she walked up to her front door and went inside. 

“Hey, I have been waiting for you for hours. A little text saying you were going to be late wouldn't have been a hard gesture.” Adam came to her and helped her shrug out of her coat. He hung it up and embraced Tyra before looking at her. “Did you have a rough day?” He could see the stress and perplexity on Tyra’s face. 

“I will have to find a new job; things weren’t really working out with that company.” Tyra cleared her throat and walked into her kitchen. She grabbed a wine glass out of her cupboard and poured herself a heavy bit of scarlet wine. She took a long, hard sip and looked at Adam. 

He was the man she loved. Perfect for her in everyway and coming close to a torturous death that no one could understand has really made Tyra look at him differently.

1r30xz9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1r30xz9/should_i_stay_as_a_pa/,Should I stay as a PA?,"Hi all. Hope everyone’s having a good day! Asking this question on a throwaway. I was recently hired to be a stagehand PA / labourer for one of my country’s national news program. 

So far I’ve only trained but the expectation is that within a week or two I’ll be able to do the show on my own. However, throughout my few training shits I’ve realized just how much I don’t enjoy it. It’s waking up early (4AM) for a program which I’m not interested (mainly looking to work in fiction, not news/unscripted). The role is primarily moving the set around while live and just picking things up, putting them down, making coffee, etc. On top of all that, it’s non-union so I make around 3x less than I would if this were a union gig. 

Now I know normally if this is what gets your foot in the door you bear it all with a smile and continue. However I’m also working at a new production company which is doing the exact kind of things I want to do. They’ve really added me to their team and I’ve been assisting in all aspects of the pipeline. The main issue here is because they’re new they don’t yet have the funds to pay me a salary. Whenever a project gets picked up they pay me, but during those periods we’re working towards a project currently I don’t (they are hoping to change this as more projects get picked up). The great thing with them is not only am I learning about the parts of the industry that interest me but I also get to meet all sorts of great people from there! 

With this new PA gig it definitely also impacts how much I can work for the production company + my energy levels when I end up getting home to work on stuff for them. 

TLDR: So basically I’m just wondering if I should stick with this PA gig even though it’s not in the same space of the industry I’m interested in or if I should let them know that I’m leaving. And if I do leave, how do I do that without burning any bridges?",0,1770920227.0,Filmmakers,0,0.5,False
1r30xdb,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1r30xdb/the_psychology_of_how_adhd_brains_can_hack/,The Psychology of How ADHD Brains Can Hack Dopamine to Stay Focused,"Look, if you've got ADHD or even suspect you might, you already know the struggle. Your brain is basically a dopamine-starved machine that's constantly searching for the next hit of stimulation. That boring task you need to finish? Your brain literally can't generate enough interest chemicals to care. Meanwhile, scrolling TikTok for three hours? That's dopamine heaven.

I've gone deep into the research on this, talked to neuroscientists, devoured books, listened to experts like [Dr. Russell Barkley](https://www.russellbarkley.org/) and [Dr. Ned Hallowell](https://drhallowell.com/), and here's what I've learned: Your ADHD brain isn't broken. It's just wired differently. The dopamine deficit in your prefrontal cortex makes focusing on non-stimulating tasks feel like running a marathon in quicksand. But here's the good news, there are actual, science-backed ways to hack your dopamine system and get your brain to cooperate.

This isn't about willpower or ""just trying harder."" That's garbage advice that doesn't work for ADHD brains. This is about understanding your neurobiology and working with it instead of against it.

Step 1: Accept That Your Brain Needs More Stimulation (Not Less)

Here's where most people get it wrong. They tell you to eliminate distractions, sit in a quiet room, and focus. For ADHD brains, that's torture. Your brain is literally understimulated, so it goes hunting for dopamine anywhere it can find it.

The hack? Add the right kind of stimulation. Try working with white noise, lo-fi music, or even background sounds. Some people swear by brown noise or binaural beats. Your brain needs a baseline level of stimulation to stay engaged. Experiment with different sounds until you find what keeps you in the zone without being distracting.

Another wild trick: body doubling. This is where you work alongside someone else (in person or virtually). There are apps like [Focusmate](https://www.focusmate.com/) that pair you with strangers for 50-minute work sessions. Something about another human being present creates just enough social pressure and stimulation to keep your brain locked in.

Step 2: Use Dopamine Stacking to Make Tasks Less Painful

Since ADHD brains struggle with tasks that don't naturally produce dopamine, you need to artificially inject dopamine into boring activities. This is called dopamine stacking.

Pair the boring task with something your brain already loves. Examples:

Listen to your favorite podcast or music while doing dishes or organizing.

Use a standing desk or walk on a treadmill while working (movement increases dopamine).

Set a timer and race against it (competition and urgency trigger dopamine).

Gamify everything. Turn tasks into a point system, give yourself XP for finishing things.

[Habitica](https://habitica.com/) is an app that literally turns your life into an RPG game. You create a character, set up daily quests (your tasks), and earn rewards for completing them. Your brain gets the dopamine hit from ""leveling up"" instead of just checking off a boring to-do list.

Step 3: Externalize Everything Your Brain Can't Hold

ADHD brains have terrible working memory. You can't rely on remembering things, so stop trying. Externalize everything.

Use visual timers like the [Time Timer](https://www.timetimer.com/) app so you can actually see time passing (ADHD brains are notoriously bad at time perception).

Keep everything out in the open. If it's in a drawer or folder, it doesn't exist to your brain. Use clear containers, open shelving, visual reminders.

Use sticky notes everywhere for immediate tasks. Digital reminders get ignored, but a bright pink note stuck to your laptop screen is harder to miss.

I also recommend checking out [*Driven to Distraction*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108593.Driven_to_Distraction) by [Dr. Edward Hallowell](https://drhallowell.com/) and [Dr. John Ratey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Ratey). These guys are ADHD experts and the book is basically the bible for understanding how ADHD brains work. It'll make you feel less like a failure and more like someone who just needs different tools. Seriously, this book changed how thousands of people view their ADHD. It's not preachy, it's practical, and it's written by people who actually get it.

For those who want a more structured approach to building ADHD-friendly habits, there's [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450), a personalized learning app that pulls from books, research papers, and expert talks to create custom audio content. You can set a goal like ""manage ADHD as a creative professional"" and it generates a learning plan specifically for you, breaking down insights from neuroscience research and ADHD specialists into bite-sized episodes.

What makes it useful is the flexibility, you can choose between a quick 10-minute summary or a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context, depending on your energy level. The voice customization is surprisingly helpful too, you can pick something energetic when you need a boost or calming for evening learning. Plus, you can pause mid-episode to ask questions or get clarifications, which is perfect for those moments when your brain latches onto a specific concept and wants to explore it further. It's like having an adaptive study buddy that adjusts to how your brain works that day.

Step 4: Leverage Hyperfocus (Your Secret Weapon)

People think ADHD means you can't focus. Wrong. You can focus intensely, you just can't control when or what you focus on. That's hyperfocus, and it's actually your superpower if you learn to trigger it intentionally.

Here's how:

Remove friction before starting. Set everything up so you can dive straight in. Pre-open documents, pre-pour your coffee, pre-eliminate decisions.

Use the 2-minute rule: Tell yourself you'll only work for 2 minutes. Often, once you start, hyperfocus kicks in and you keep going.

Work in sprints: Use the Pomodoro technique but adjust it for ADHD. Instead of 25-minute blocks, try 15 or 10. Find your sweet spot.

The trick is to catch the hyperfocus wave when it shows up and ride it as long as possible. Don't fight it when your brain wants to dive deep into something, even if it's not the ""right"" task. Sometimes finishing something is better than forcing yourself to work on the thing your brain is resisting.

Step 5: Medication Isn't Cheating (It's Leveling the Playing Field)

Let's be real. If you have clinical ADHD, lifestyle hacks alone might not cut it. Medication increases baseline dopamine levels in your brain so you can actually function like everyone else.

Stimulant medications like Adderall or Ritalin aren't giving you an unfair advantage. They're correcting a neurochemical deficit. It's like saying someone with bad eyesight is cheating by wearing glasses.

If you're on the fence about meds, talk to a psychiatrist who specializes in ADHD. And if medication isn't for you, look into supplements like L-tyrosine (a dopamine precursor) or omega-3s, which some research suggests can help with ADHD symptoms. But don't just randomly start popping pills, talk to a professional first.

Step 6: Movement is Non-Negotiable

Exercise is one of the most underrated ADHD treatments. Physical movement increases dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin, all the brain chemicals ADHD brains are lacking.

You don't need to become a gym rat. Just move. Take a walk, do jumping jacks, dance like an idiot in your room. Even 10 minutes of movement can give your brain the chemical boost it needs to focus for the next hour.

Dr. John Ratey's book [*Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/721609.Spark) dives deep into how exercise literally rewires your brain. He shows how movement isn't just good for your body, it's essential for your brain's ability to focus, learn, and regulate emotions. For ADHD brains, this is huge. This book will make you want to lace up your sneakers immediately.

Step 7: Create ""Focus Rituals"" Your Brain Can't Ignore

ADHD brains love routines but hate boredom. The solution? Create rituals that signal to your brain it's time to focus.

Always start work sessions with the same playlist.

Use the same scent (like peppermint oil) when you need to focus.

Wear a specific hat or piece of clothing during work time.

Your brain starts associating these cues with focus mode, making it easier to switch gears. It's like Pavlov's dog, but for productivity.

Step 8: Accept That Some Days Just Suck

Here's the truth nobody wants to hear: Some days, your ADHD brain just won't cooperate, no matter how many hacks you throw at it. And that's okay.

Don't beat yourself up. Don't spiral into shame. Your worth isn't determined by your productivity. On bad days, do the bare minimum and call it a win. The goal is progress, not perfection.

ADHD brains are inconsistent by nature. You're going to have incredible hyperfocus days where you crush it, and you're going to have days where brushing your teeth feels like climbing Everest. Both are valid.

Use the [Finch](https://finchcare.com/) app on those rough days. It's a self-care app where you take care of a little bird by completing small tasks like drinking water or taking a breath. It's stupidly wholesome and gives you tiny dopamine hits for doing basic human things. Sometimes that's all you need.

Final Word

Your ADHD brain isn't a curse. It's different, and different needs different strategies. Stop trying to force yourself into neurotypical productivity systems that were never designed for you. Build your own system, experiment, fail, adjust, and try again.

I typically play DayOne as I prefer no build-adventure style servers, in the past played The Struggle and DayZero with friends who are newer. I want to be able to show them a good time, but being able to meet up can be a problem for people who can barely keep themselves alive due to hunger/zombies. I find typically the servers I play aren't super conducive for discord play, as these servers generally promote player interaction, and meeting up with someone random on the coast is much simpler than running across the world to find your discord mate(especially if they don't know the map well). Namalsk has typically been an easier experience meeting up, and though Namalsk is one of my favorite maps, the player density and cold mechanics/frozen food can be frustrating to new players.

I know there are maps with sleeping bags, but I really don't like the rustafied version of this game, and sleeping bags/bases really promote a gameplay loop that I am not a fan of. Perhaps a server that has some choice of spawn would be the best course of action, and just ignore any base building aspect. I don't want KarmaKrew/Basically Vanilla/any PVP server as I don't really vibe with heavily modded numbers and infinite stam. Perhaps I'm being a bit too picky, but I'm willing to compromise what I find is the most fun way to play DayZ just to get these people up and running.

I was Thinking this is going to be great....I can go to a different coffee shop every day, I will have access to world-class coffee, super genius baristas.  Despite somewhat downer of divorce, life will be improved in this way. Coffee is a big deal to me.

So I did this and went to many many coffee shops all over the place recommended here and didn't think I was really finding great espresso or small latte/flat white which I like

BUT I finally figured out, after all this time (yes I'm an idiot who didn't do his research)....All the notable coffee shops in Chicago are third wave. 

 That's where the younger more experimental people seem to go.  Differentiates them from Starbucks - totally smart from both a creative and a business perspective. And they seem to like sour coffee.

I much prefer really awesome second wave coffee.  I make my own with a breville setup and cheap Italian beans - I never find place that make more satisfying lattes than I make at home. I want to by beans locally but they are all too light.

This is a case where reading reviews on Reddit has not helped me.

  
Does anyone have recommendations on Italian/Dark Roast coffee places?

I come into the office three days a week, always do my hours and quite often work late.

I’ve been at the company for four years and every now and then it comes up in a review or a meeting that I’m not always “present”. I am present for the hours that I have agreed and I do occasionally step away to take a colleague for a coffee on your meet a new business prospect.

I’ve now been told I need to stop going for coffees and when I’m in the office be clearly seated at a desk to make my presence known. This will impact on new business but also to me just sounds ridiculous. 

I’ve also been told to rethink my calendar to showcase presence and presenteeism if anyone “happens” to dip in!

I’ve got a clear agreement on my hours but it keeps coming up time and time again. I can’t live with the ongoing anxiety about presenteeism and I feel the company should just make a formal decision if flexible working doesn’t work for them. That way it can either stop any moans from colleagues who believe I’m not in the office enough or I can reconsider my options.

Are other people finding this at their companies? Did flexible working become a thing a few years ago but now it’s no longer been tolerated?

1r30ro1,https://www.reddit.com/r/exjw/comments/1r30ro1/seven_years_in_a_buick_part_2/,Seven Years in a Buick - Part 2,"Continuing on in our RP adventures for years in rural Appalachia my husband and I had quite a few unbelievable situations happen.  We had guns pulled on us, were chased by pot growers on quads down the road, had dogs set loose on us, snake handlers speak in tongues at us, you name it.  But somehow everything we encountered in the field pales to what we dealt with in the car groups.

One of our more famous pioneer sisters was Peg (names changed) who had been at the pioneer work for close to 50 years.  She could quote the Bible from memory in three different versions.  I was truly impressed with her Bible knowledge at the time.  And Peg was not one to be messed with.  She believed her ministry was the only thing keeping her alive - literally.  She had previously had a couple bouts with cancer, mini strokes, heart problems, etc.  Think the Winchester Mystery House woman - as long as she kept building onto the house she stayed alive.

So Peg took pioneering to the next level.  It was almost militant. No breaks, no unnecessary stops, no nonsense.  And guess who was her favorite service partner? Me.  And guess who's house we unknowingly bought across the street from when we moved to the area - yep Peg's house.  She had 24/7 access to see if I was home or not.  So I had a built in service monitor the entire time we lived in that house.  At first I thought it would be a great spiritual privilege to work along side someone with her wealth of knowledge and experience.  My husband and I signed up to RP that first month and the adventures began.

So Peg and her husband were long timers from the south.  Think very formal.  Dinners at their house were real China dishes and in the formal dining room.  Her husband would wear his suit to doctors appointments.  Peg carried herself like a southern belle.  Always makeup fully done, jewelry, nylons, everything was perfectly ironed, and then there was the wigs.  Big Texas style wigs that were somehow always a little crooked.  From a distance she appeared like Cruella De Vil.  She commanded respect and attention everywhere she went and the householder was no exception.  I quickly learned my California casual dress was not gonna cut it with her.

Peg in true fashion drove a large Cadillac sedan.  I would often get cornered at the meetings to make sure I would be at the service meeting in the morning and available to spend the entire day with her in service.  I'm not even joking when I say the entire day.  I would get into her Cadillac and she would hit the automatic locks loudly several times almost to signal I was ""locked in"".  We would literally be out till after dark.  Also if Peg thought the brother conduction the meeting for service was taking too long she had no problem interrupting and telling him to wrap it up.

Now Peg was one of those legendary pioneers that brought many many people into the truth. She doggedly followed them even if they moved.  She had lots of studies and countless return visits.  Our territory spanned three counties and we coved them with a fine tooth comb.  No gravel road was too rough for her Cadillac!  We bounced up wagon carts if she thought she saw a shack, and not surprisingly we often found someone living in those shacks.  If you have ever been in field service in Appalachia you know they have deep respect for the Bible.  That actually made service somewhat enjoyable, talking to sincere Bible loving people.

Out of respect we often got invited in and Peg being elderly was viewed with reverence.  Once inside Peg unleashed her furry!  She demanded all TV's and music be turned off.  She told the parents to make the children come sit in front of her and pay attention.  To my surprise they almost always complied!  Once we had the whole family sitting at attention she would inform them she was there to teach them the ""truth about the Bible"" and not what they had been taught in their church.  The householders would often exchange nervous glances and more than once we were in the Pastor of the church's own home.  Peg would be completely unfazed and carry on as if they had zero Bible knowledge.

Southern hospitality was of utmost importance to Peg.  She trained her Bible students to meet her expectations.  On one study with a kind woman Peg was conducting the study and stopped mid paragraph to ask the woman if she had any coffee she could drink.  The woman said no she didn't drink coffee. Peg said no problem and continued back to the paragraph. A few minutes later Peg again stopped and asked the woman if she had any cake she could serve her.  The woman now looking confused said no she didn't have any cake either.  Peg looking put out said and I quote ""I like to have coffee and cake in the afternoon and if I'm going to continue teaching you about the Bible I expect it to be ready for me each week."".  I was completely horrified and the woman nodded that she understood.  From that day forward every week she had coffee and cake for Peg.

So week after week, door after door, I would be Peg's go to for all her far flung studies and calls.  One winter we had a particularly bad ice storm.  Schools closed, grocery stores were empty, and power was out across the state.  I foolishly assumed we would not go out with the roads being dangerous - wrong! I was happily sleeping in when Peg was knocking on our front door.  Dressed for service and demanding why I wasn't ready.  The guilt kicked in and I quickly got dressed and got in the Cadillac.  We had no business being out on the roads and the householders pointed it out that it was not safe for Peg to be driving.  We slid all over the roads and barely made it back home.  At the time I legit thought the angels were the only thing keeping us alive. Peg even pulled over to take her nitroglycerine pills for her heart several times!

As the winter wore on and the snow kept coming we would stay to territory in town to Peg's dismay.  After one particularly unsuccessful day in service while it was getting dark Peg recalled an RV she used to have in the area.  We pulled onto the street and Peg was delighted to see the home had all the front lights on and the driveway cleared of snow.  She said they had laid out the red carpet for us and it was a sign from Jehovah to call on them.  We park and walk up to the porch.  Peg rings the bell just as another car pulls in the driveway behind us.  The door opens and the whole family is standing there looking confused.  The mother says ""Peg! What are you doing here at night?"".  Oh the car behind us was the pizza delivery guy.  The whole family was excited that their dinner was being delivered only to open the door and see Peg!  Pizza guy walks up behind us holding the hot pizzas and Peg tells him ""Not now!  Come back a little later"".  I almost died and the look on the little kids faces as Peg was sending their dinner away!  Thankfully the father came out and took the pizzas from the guy.  To Peg's shock the mother told her to leave and not come back in the politest way.

It kept moving.
I did not.

It edits the future into catastrophe,
turns silence into abandonment,
turns love into a test I am already failing.

then language.

how spite becomes shelter,
how isolation grows proud roots.
I swore I would not rot in that cellar.
I swore I would choose warmth.

So I did.
I chose brightness over bitterness.
I chose softness over spite.
I chose to stay reachable
while quietly dissolving.

And when I finally spoke
when I let the darkness unclench its jaw
it came out wrong.
Too heavy. Too late.
Like a flood confessing to a door.

I placed my breaking in your hands
without asking if they were ready.
That is where I failed you.
Not in loving
but in bleeding without warning.

You thought I was cruel.
You thought I was indifferent.
You thought my calm was poison.
But I was only ever
a person who learned to survive
without witnesses.

There is nothing romantic
about a body that keeps moving
only because it must.
Nothing poetic
about lungs that work
without believing in air.

They said time heals.
My clock coughs blood.
Its hands shake in small circles
like they’re unsure
whether to measure minutes
or mourning.

In one month
I learned how quickly a will can thin
how hope can starve quietly,
how a voice can forget its owner,
how distance can grow teeth.
I tried to change.
I buried habits.
I swallowed pride.
I learned the discipline of not-reaching.
But winter stayed.
And some nights feel terminal
not as an ending,
but as a room
with no windows left.

If I seem distant,
it’s because something in me already left.
If I seem cheerful,
it’s because sorrow never asked
who it was exhausting.
If I failed you,
it was not from indifference
it was from carrying storms
in pockets too small.

When everything burns,
what survives longer

or the person
still trying
to breathe inside it?

I chose brightness over bitterness.

I chose to stay reachable

You thought I was indifferent.
You thought my calm was poison.

about a body that keeps moving
only because it must.
Nothing poetic
about lungs that work
without believing in air.

My clock coughs blood.
Its hands shake in small circles

whether to measure minutes
or mourning.

In one month
I learned how quickly a will can thin
how hope can starve quietly,
how a voice can forget its owner,
how distance can grow teeth.
I tried to change.
I buried habits.
I swallowed pride.
I learned the discipline of not-reaching.
But winter stayed.
And some nights feel terminal
not as an ending,
but as a room
with no windows left.

If I seem distant,
it’s because something in me already left.
If I seem cheerful,
it’s because sorrow never asked
who it was exhausting.
If I failed you,
it was not from indifference
it was from carrying storms
in pockets too small.

I hope this message finds you well, preferably after a wholesome home-cooked meal.

What I’m Looking For:

A kind-hearted South Indian Brahmin gentleman.

Open-minded enough to date with sincerity before marriage.

Intelligent conversations.

They told me to romanticize it
to pour my grief into porcelain cups,
to let rivers rinse the ruin,
to place flowers beside the fracture
and call it healing.

But flowers rot politely.
Grief does not.

I walked along water
hoping it would borrow my heaviness,
but even the river refused inheritance.
It kept moving.
I did not.

In cafés I rehearsed being alive
steam rising like a fragile alibi,
sugar dissolving the way I wished I could.
I watched people belong to their hours,
watched them wear their lives
like fitted skin.
I wore mine like a borrowed coat
too heavy,
never warm.
They see the smile.
God, I built that smile carefully.
Thread by thread.
It is the only architecture
that never collapses in public.

But they don’t see the morning ritual
how even making coffee feels like war,
how my hands tremble over heat
as if warmth might accuse me,
how the spoon against porcelain
sounds like a verdict.

Anxiety does not scream.
It whispers perfectly.
It edits the future into catastrophe,
turns silence into abandonment,
turns love into a test I am already failing.

Depression does not cry.
It subtracts.
It takes color first,
then appetite,
then language.
Until breath feels like an obligation
signed in invisible ink.

So I laughed louder.
Spoke lighter.
Stayed golden.
A sun trained not to eclipse.

I read the man underground
like a warning scratched into stone
how spite becomes shelter,
how isolation grows proud roots.
I swore I would not rot in that cellar.
I swore I would choose warmth.

Height: tall enough

What I bring to the date:
• Peaceful, drama-free conversations
• Coffee enthusiasm (I will definitely suggest coffee)
• Random poetic or philosophical lines out of nowhere
• Someone who actually listens to what you like — movies, music, weird hobbies, all welcome
• Calm walks, simple hangouts, and a surprisingly comfortable vibe

My likes: quiet places, meaningful talks, good music, and people who can laugh at small awkward moments.
Your likes: equally important — I’ll happily go along with what you enjoy too (yes, even if it’s something I don’t usually do).

Disclaimer:
Might be slightly shy at first, but warms up faster than your coffee if the vibe is good.

1r30dz6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndeedJobs/comments/1r30dz6/indeed_hiding_jobs_more_thoroughly_than_before/,Indeed hiding jobs more thoroughly than before,"So, if you've been using Indeed for the past several months, you may have noticed that, no matter how many search result it says there are, when you're logged in, it will not show you any more than two pages of results, for any given search.

Users more intelligent than me determined that this issue could be circumvented by doing your search on a window while logged out, and then linking the job postings you find to a window in which you're logged in. It wasn't pretty, and it certainly wasn't fun, working around the tool that's supposed to help with my job search, but, it worked. I had naïvely assumed 'bugs happen,' and that, given the amount of threads I'd seen with people running into this issue, saying they've reported it, that Indeed was aware of it, and would fix it, given time.

Enter today, I've just had my morning coffee, checked my emails to see 1/4 of the applications I've sent out were denied, while the rest had no responses, I hop on Indeed to find and send out applications to any suitable jobs in my list of searches. It had been a bit since I search with Indeed, and I see that there should be more results than the ones I'm seeing on the first two pages, so I open an incognito window, and paste the search into it.

Lo and behold, Indeed has made an update to this situation. Not one that fixes the problem, no, that would make too much sense. Instead, Indeed now requires you to be logged in to see more than one page of results. So, now, whether you're logged in or not, Indeed will only show you the top 2 pages of results, if you want to dig deeper, you have to narrow your search, fool around with the filters, or search for results on sites \*other than\* Indeed. I was baffled, confused as to why Indeed would make such a change, as surely it would draw attention to the issue, and make job posters and searchers alike, stop using it, since the site is actively hiding a massive number of results from searchers.

So, I complain about it to my friends over Discord (a can of worms about a company sabotaging itself best saved for a different time,) and he directed me to a video on YouTube (again, website issues to be explored at a later date,) released by 'The Fat Files' about a day or so ago. I won't link it here, but the title is 'The Most Important Website Ever - Craigslist' and I would recommend giving it a watch if you have a 20 minutes to spare. The video enlightened me to a practice which Indeed engages in that I was not aware of, having never been a job poster myself, that being ""sponsoring"" your job posting. Such that, if a job poster gives Indeed more money, that posting will appear more often, be recommended to potential applicants more often, and, most importantly, appear first in search results.

The pieces clicked into place, but now I have questions. Assuming that what appears evident, that being, Indeed is actively hiding job results to inflate the relative traffic of their biggest, and most well-paying customers, thereby encouraging all of their other customers to use their paid services more, are there not laws being violated here? I know for a fact, if I had paid for a posting on Indeed, only to find that my posting was simply not findable for the vast majority of potential applicants because I didn't pay for the most premium options, I'd be rather upset, and I'd be looking for either a refund or legal recompense, depending on how long such practices have been taking place.

All that said, since it's evident, that, in Indeed's current state, I would be spending more time actively trying to work around the systems in place which have been hiding results from me, than I would finding and sending out actual applications to relevant openings, I'm looking for good alternatives at the moment. If anyone reading this has had good experiences with other job searching sites or services, I'd love to hear about them.

I was at a cafe and I had a handsome Indian man sit down and start a conversation with me. I'm 38 but pale and blonde so this happens often and also I found people to be friendly in general on my travels. I originally didn't really want to talk to him as I had been unwell and it was the second time that day that someone had come up to me while I was trying to eat but I didn't want to be impolite. 

We ended up having a good conversation (he was 28) but I wanted to get back to my hotel room so I started to leave and he wanted to stay in contact so I gave him my instagram. The guy messaged immediately and wanted to hang out straight away but I said no. He then msged me at 4am(because I was leaving the city the next day) that I should visit him in his city or maybe we could travel together to my next destination. 

The next day I woke up much sicker and weaker. The guy messaged me again asking how my day is etc and wanting to meet up. I ended up not leaving the city because of feeling weak and went to have food. The guy msged to meet up. Feeling weak and having been travelling alone for two months in India I really just needed some company so I said the guy could meet me for dinner. We had food or really I just shared my dinner with him and then walked around for a while before having coffee in the garden of hostel. I was feeling very weak and lonely and he wanted to come to my room so I let him. He was sweet and respectful and ended up sleeping the night in my room. The next day he said he wanted to come to my next destination with me. I said he was welcome to come.

He booked on to the same train as me and we departed together. He was very helpful because he was able to speak to everyone in Hindi and negotiate with taxis which I didnt have the strength to at the time. I wanted to stay somewhere with private rooms so I booked a hotel and he was welcome to stay with me. I dont know why I was so trusting but I just trusted my instinct that he was a safe person. After a long train ride we got to the hotel and he was reluctant to give his id to check in to the hotel and didnt really want his name on the room. I was not expecting him to pay because I wanted to stay there. 

We had a great day exporing the new city and seeing the sites but any big expenses (expensive cab ride or meals) I paid which I was happy to do (noting I would not accept this in my home country). He would buy smaller things and paid for his entry tickets to sites. We were intimate and every time initiated by him - always very passionate but then a bit distant after. He was very loving and affectionate. Long story we had a great trip together and I thought we were both happy with what it was. The day I was leaving we hung out and went to a library together and sat and talked and he genuinely seemed like he didnt want to go to his train. 

We hugged goodbye and then were messaging goodbye and all that and it was all a lovely memory. And then he tried to call me but I missed the call. THen I got a message asking me if I could help him out with some money because he is a phd student and he doesnt want to ask his family etc and then sent me his UPI barcode. This was like a stab in the chest of a lovely few days ruined. I felt so stupid and like a creepy stupid old woman on a documentary who has been taken for a ride by a guy for money. Am I crazy? Was it all a scam from the start? Or am I just judging too harshly. Wanting locals opinions. ",4,1770918822.0,DatingInIndia,7,1.0,False

1r307cs,https://www.reddit.com/r/DuxburyDeathsFreeTalk/comments/1r307cs/new_yorker_article_part_2/,New Yorker Article (Part 2),"By mid-January, back under the supervision of Jennifer Tufts, Lindsay seemed to be improving, and she began accompanying Pat on outings with the kids. On a few occasions, she encouraged him to leave the house himself. He joined a group of dads for a Sunday brunch and took Cora skiing on Martin Luther King, Jr., Day. Both times, Lindsay looked after some or all of the kids alone. Her parents visited from Connecticut on the weekend of January 21st, and afterward Lindsay’s mom wrote to her in a text, “Nice to see you doing better.”

It had become routine for Pat to hug Lindsay each morning and ask, “How are you feeling? How did you sleep?” On January 24th, he told me, her answers were “good” and “pretty well.” The kids were off from school and Pat had back-to-back meetings, so child care was left to Lindsay. The fact that she could bring her daughter to a medical appointment in the morning has been cited as evidence of her mental acuity, but Pat told me that it wasn’t an ordinary checkup. Cora had a stomach ache, and Lindsay had become fixated on the idea that something could be wrong with her liver. Pat had hoped that a visit to the pediatrician would “bring Lindsay back to reality.”

Around five o’clock, she texted him to ask if he’d pick up Pedia-Lax for Cora, plus a takeout order for dinner. “I didn’t cook anything,” she wrote. “It’s been a long day.” Had Lindsay asked him to run such an errand a few weeks before, Pat told me, he might have had second thoughts about leaving her alone. “If I could go back in time, I’d have called McLean and said, ‘Take her away, lock the door. Keep her in there for a year if you have to.’ ” But, he said, that day “seemed like a really good one.” I mentioned that the same is often said before suicides: a sense of peace can set in when someone in despair decides to end things. “So what do you do?” Pat asked, sounding offended, then genuinely uncertain. “Somebody’s having a great day. Should I call the hotline?”

Less than half an hour after leaving, Pat called Lindsay from CVS to confirm which brand of medicine to buy. She didn’t pick up at first, but she called back a minute later, sounding like herself. Their conversation lasted fourteen seconds. Pat noticed only, as he later told the police, that she seemed to be in the middle of something.

The house was quiet when Pat returned from his errand, just after six o’clock. He set the takeout containers and the CVS bag on the kitchen counter and went upstairs, thinking that Lindsay might be giving the kids a bath.

The door to the master bedroom was locked, but he forced his way in. The room was cold; the window had been left open. There was blood on the floor and a bloody knife on the nightstand, beside a novelty tumbler labelled “Because Kids.” Pat ran back downstairs and found Lindsay lying outside, barely conscious. “What did you do?” he said, shining his phone’s flashlight into her eyes. She replied, “I tried to kill myself.” He asked where the kids were, and she said, “In the basement.” Pat stayed by her side as he dialed 911, terrified that she’d die. When paramedics arrived, minutes later, he rushed inside to retrieve the children, unaware that he was still on the line with the emergency dispatcher.

On the recording of the call, which Jennifer Sprague, the prosecutor, narrated at Lindsay’s arraignment, Pat shouts down to the basement, “Guys?” Sprague explained, “He can then be heard screaming in agony and shock.” The kids still had exercise bands tied around their necks. Pat removed the bands and begged each child to breathe. He attempted to resuscitate Cora, who was lying on her side. “What do you do when you have three kids like that?” he asked me. “How do you pick?” For a while after moving to New York, Pat would say that his children “lost their lives.” When the paramedics reached the basement, though, he could be heard on the line crying, “She killed the kids!”

In “Mothers Who Kill Their Children,” published in 2001, the legal scholar Michelle Oberman and the psychologist Cheryl Meyer characterize American public policy on maternal infanticide as “a combination of denial and punishment.” We “studiously ignore” the crime’s risk factors, they write, and “then cleanse our collective conscience” by doling out the harshest sentences. In much of the Western world, women who kill their children in the postpartum period receive probation and mandated mental-health care rather than prison sentences. About two dozen countries have legally defined infanticide as a less culpable form of murder, recognizing the hormonal impact of pregnancy and childbirth on what many laws call “the balance of a woman’s mind.”

In the U.S., mentally ill women who’ve killed their children tend to resort to insanity defenses, whose parameters vary by jurisdiction. One common insanity test, dating to the eighteen-hundreds, requires a criminal defendant to prove either that she didn’t understand her actions or that she didn’t know they were wrong. In Massachusetts, though, a more lenient and more contentious insanity test considers not only whether a defendant understood right from wrong but also the woolly question of whether she was able to act in accordance with that understanding at the time of the crime. This standard was widely condemned in the nineteen-eighties, after it was used to find John Hinckley, Jr., not guilty for trying to assassinate Ronald Reagan, an attack that he’d meticulously premeditated.

Phillip Resnick, a leading filicide expert who was hired by Lindsay’s legal team to evaluate her, told me that women accused of killing their children might benefit from society’s reflexive assumptions about a mother’s “unconditional love”: she must have been insane to kill her child, since no sane mother ever would. Psychiatric studies often refer to the phenomenon of mothers killing their children before killing themselves as “extended suicide.” Killing one’s child under the delusion that it’s in his best interest is described, even more euphemistically, as “altruistic filicide.” In a perverse circular logic, the crime itself can come to seem like the clearest evidence of the condition that is held up to exculpate the mother—and also like its own form of punishment. Andrea Yates, who had a documented history of psychosis, was ultimately found not guilty by reason of insanity in the deaths of her children and confined to a state mental hospital. Though she has long been eligible to be evaluated for release, she has reportedly chosen to remain institutionalized year after year.

 

During phone calls with Lindsay, Pat says, “I think one of the first things I asked was, ‘Did you plan this?’ ”

Despite publicly forgiving Lindsay, Pat didn’t contact her after the killings. He stayed with his parents at their home on Scituate Harbor, not far from where he grew up. Periodically, he went back to Duxbury to pick up clothing and deliveries from the house; once, on the doorstep, he discovered a rotting apple pie. So many reporters had gathered in the town that he held the children’s funeral at his parents’ church. Three small coffins were rolled out into the nave, and a priest read Pat’s eulogy on his behalf, because, as one of his cousins recalled, “he was basically catatonic.”

A couple of days before the arraignment, Pat got a voice mail from a number that he didn’t recognize. It was Lindsay, calling from a psychologist’s cell phone to say that she loved him. She called back the next day, as Pat was wandering the shoreline, and this time he picked up. Speaking at a quick, panicked clip, Lindsay explained that she’d heard a voice commanding her to kill the children, and then herself, because it was her “last chance.” Pat told me, “She did not sound like my wife.” He ended the call after about a minute.

For months, he was consumed with the thought that “nothing was left.” In February, he took a solo trip to Central America and then to Europe, staying in youth hostels to avoid the sight of vacationing families. When he got back, he cleared out the Duxbury house and drove around town handing off his children’s stuffed animals and unused arcade cards to friends. He didn’t realize until arriving in New York that his new building sits beside a preschool. In the mornings, he often sees rushed mothers and fathers coaxing their clingy kids through the doors. “I envy their misery,” Pat told me.

After Pat’s unsettling first call with Lindsay, they went six months without speaking. That spring, after a stint at a rehabilitation facility, she was transferred to Tewksbury Hospital, a state-run institution with a large population of psychiatric patients in criminal custody. Her parents were living out of a hotel to be near her, and although Pat and Lindsay hadn’t been particularly religious, the pastor who’d baptized Callan had been visiting weekly from Duxbury to pray. A psychiatrist said that rosary beads were a suicide hazard, so the pastor brought a string of them that wasn’t long enough to fit around Lindsay’s neck. On her thirty-third birthday, last August, Pat called her at the suggestion of her father, who told him that she was in “tough shape and going downhill.” (Lindsay’s parents declined to speak with me.) Lindsay was playing Rummikub with a therapist when Pat reached her. She told him that every day was the worst day of her life. “She misses her kids,” Pat explained, then added, “Which I know sounds crazy to some people. But that’s the reality.”

The ample evidence that Lindsay was a loving mother has made it difficult for Sprague, the prosecutor, to supply a plausible motive for the killings. In court, Sprague has labored to depict Lindsay as a selfish woman disillusioned with domestic life, reading aloud a note that Lindsay had written to herself five months after Callan’s birth: “I think I sort of resent my other children because they prevent me from treating Cal like my first baby. . . . I want to feel love and connection with all of my kids.” Sprague concluded, “This would indicate that she did not feel love or connection with at least some of her kids.” On the Internet, Lindsay’s detractors found a post from a parenting forum in which she once described Dawson, her middle child, as “the most difficult human I have ever encountered.” This didn’t sound especially different from a line in Pat’s eulogy—“Make no mistake, this boy loved to push buttons”—but it was touted by online observers as incriminating evidence. A member of Lindsay’s mom group in Duxbury, who was questioned by a group of male police officers after the killings, told me that they’d printed out the women’s text correspondence and interrogated her about Lindsay’s frustrations with Dawson’s sleep schedule. The woman recalled replying, “I can pull up messages like this from all of my friends who are moms.”

Last September, Lindsay’s case was moved to the Massachusetts Superior Court. At a hearing that October, Sprague suggested that her suicide attempt was halfhearted and possibly staged, calling the lacerations on her neck and wrists from that night “minor scratches.” Lindsay’s cuts had been deep enough to leave streaks of blood on the bedroom floor and on the home’s shingled exterior, but Sprague presented the latter detail as evidence that Lindsay had “slid down” the side of the house, adding, “She did not jump.” The hearing was held at Tewksbury Hospital, so that Lindsay could attend in person. She sat across from Sprague at a long conference table, in a wheelchair. As if to explain Lindsay’s paralysis, Sprague said, “I don’t think she took into account the fact that the ground was frozen.”

The only times Pat sounded heated or sarcastic in our conversations were when discussing the prosecution or the “ringworms on social media,” as he called them. “It’s really hard to kill yourself,” he said, one night at his apartment. “If you think it’s so easy, why don’t you try?” In his bedroom, he keeps a bag of letters from sympathetic strangers, many of whom relate their own battles with postpartum mood disorders. Pat showed me one handwritten note that said, “When I hear the prosecution speak, it sounds like the Salem witch trials.” He often characterized his forgiveness of Lindsay as a reaction against bad-faith narratives, a matter of accuracy rather than loyalty. “If the prosecutor and the public had gotten it right from the beginning, I probably wouldn’t have even written that GoFundMe note,” he said.

Pat saw Lindsay’s case as “crystal clear,” but insanity pleas face long odds even when a defendant has “florid” psychotic symptoms. Investigators had unearthed new details about Lindsay’s case that had the potential to seem damning in court. Four days before strangling the kids, she had searched the phrase “can you treat a sociopath” on her phone; she had also looked up what court records describe as “ways to kill.” Postpartum mental illnesses exist along a vexingly complex spectrum. The legal system generally presents a binary—sane and guilty, or insane and not—and a not-guilty verdict might seem unconscionable when the victims were innocent children. As Reddington, Lindsay’s lawyer, told me, “Juries don’t want it on their hands.”

One afternoon last winter, I visited Pat’s parents in Scituate. Outside their living-room windows, the harbor’s waves, which were the same pale gray as the sky, lapped at the grass in the back yard. On the coffee table was a custom jigsaw puzzle, showing Dawson smiling in a pile of leaves, which Pat had sent his mother for her birthday. Sue Clancy is a youthful-looking woman with a blond bob and a strong New England accent. Like Lindsay, she’s a labor-and-delivery nurse, and the two women briefly worked together when Lindsay did a rotation at Sue’s hospital, after nursing school. In an old informational video for patients, they sit side by side in matching blue scrubs. Sue was one of the few people in whom Lindsay confided about her difficulties after Callan’s birth. Sue told me, “I still have texts on my phone: ‘I have an appointment Tuesday and Thursday. I’m working so hard. I want to get back to myself. I want to be with my kids.’ ”

After the death of her three grandchildren, Sue tried returning to her job, but she found it too hard to be around young families: “I’d see fathers with car seats and diaper bags bringing in the siblings to meet the new baby.” Her husband, Chris, who goes by the childhood nickname Fitty, has a thick mustache and wore a wooden cross hanging from his neck. He runs a contracting company but told me that business has dropped off since the killings. Although he and Sue stood by Pat in his support of Lindsay, their feelings were more ambivalent than their son’s. Sue explained, “I don’t hate her, and I don’t call her names—I have empathy.” But, she added, “Lindsay hurt a lot of people. She hurt her parents. She hurt us and all our kids, our cousins, our community.” I asked what they thought the outcome of the case should be. Fitty began to answer, but Sue cut him off. “Lindsay has to pay for what she did,” she said. “Fortunately, it’s not up to any of us to define what that payment is.”

On the first anniversary of the tragedy, Pat and his parents returned to Duxbury for a memorial service at his and Lindsay’s old church. The town had marked the occasion with an initiative called “With Love, from Duxbury,” which encouraged people to honor the Clancy children by performing random acts of kindness. To raise funds for charity, local businesses were selling tassel bracelets and cashmere crewnecks branded with three commemorative scallop shells. “There’s no outward anger toward Lindsay in this community,” Nicole Benanto, the couple’s friend from preschool, told me. But the member of Lindsay’s mom group felt perplexed by the outpouring of sympathy. “It’s unequivocally, like, ‘This happened to them,’ ” she said. “It’s not something Lindsay did.” When I asked the pastor who’d been visiting Lindsay whether she’d said anything about the crime with which she’d been charged, he replied, “It’s interesting you say ‘crime,’ because that word has not been used at all.”

Outside the church that evening, TV reporters had gathered in the parking lot, tapping on car windows to ask people for interviews. The pews inside were full. A group of the children’s preschool teachers sat in the front row, quietly weeping. Pat spoke for six minutes, recalling his family’s last visit to the church. Dawson had gazed at the crucifix dangling from the ceiling and asked, as he often did, “Is that God?” Pat had considered urging people to pray for Lindsay, but he worried how the line would sound if it ended up in news headlines. “People are gonna be, like, ‘All he cares about is the wife,’ ” he told me the next morning.

As he drove by Lindsay’s home town on his way back to New York, Pat called her to relay well-wishes from their old neighbors. By that point, they had spoken only a few times since the children’s deaths, but over the following weeks they started talking more frequently, which allowed each of them, Pat told me, to “fill in the gaps.” For the first time in his life, he’d started going to therapy. He couldn’t stop sifting through the time line of that night. “I really beat myself up for a long time that I didn’t go to the basement first,” he said. “I would have gotten to them ten minutes earlier. But I don’t think it would have been enough.”

Despite the long course of Lindsay’s illness, Pat always portrayed her terrible act as a sudden rupture of the self, a bolt of lightning that had struck without warning. During their calls, though, he began venturing the kinds of questions that would eventually be debated in court. “I think one of the first things I asked was, ‘Did you plan this? Is that why you sent me out?’ ” he recalled. “She said, ‘No, it just was, like, a snap of the fingers.’ ” Pat asked why she’d looked up how long it would take him to pick up their dinner, and Lindsay explained that she’d been concerned about getting him stuck in rush-hour traffic. “Then I said, ‘Did you Google “ways to kill”?’ And she said, ‘Yeah, for myself, because I was suicidal for two months.’ ”

Pat sounded satisfied with this explanation. His reflexive tendency to extend Lindsay the benefit of the doubt seemed both credulous and entirely rational. Nothing the prosecution dug up was likely to shake his conviction that, as he said, “it wasn’t her making those decisions.” And yet nothing was likely to provide him clarity about her state of mind, either. What Lindsay did would remain no less painfully inscrutable. Neither exoneration nor punishment would offer resolution. “I think it’s a lot more hurtful if she did plan it, and tricked me into believing she was having a great day,” Pat told me, one of the last times we spoke. He went on, “I don’t know. I don’t know who to believe, but I don’t think it matters really.”

Phillip Resnick, the filicide expert, told me that many husbands in Pat’s position testify on behalf of their wives, although “the vast majority” also end up getting divorced. He recalled one exceptional case, of a bricklayer whose wife Resnick evaluated after she asphyxiated their young daughter and newborn son. The woman pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter, Resnick said, and was allowed to return home, under court supervision, after a brief hospitalization. The couple stayed together and went on to have another child.

Pat preferred not to comment on the status of his marriage, out of deference to Lindsay, but his mother told me, “He has to come to terms with the fact that she’s no longer part of anything. She’s gonna go her way, and he’s gonna go his.” When Pat crossed the finish line of the Boston Marathon, on April 15th, a television reporter stopped him to ask about Lindsay. “I said I forgive my wife and I do,” Pat said tersely, still sweaty and breathless. He’d run the race in a bright jersey printed with his children’s names. Commenters online were quick to notice that he wasn’t wearing his wedding ring.

Lindsay’s trial date is yet to be scheduled. “Now I wish there was a plea deal, and it was just done with,” Pat told me, in June. He was preparing to resume his job the next day, after almost eighteen months of leave from Microsoft. A fresh round of media coverage since the marathon meant that more people in New York knew his story. The Post had published a piece with the headline “GRIEVING DAD FINISHES BOSTON MARATHON IN HONOR OF 3 CHILDREN STRANGLED BY MOM.” Even Pat’s doorman had congratulated him. When I mentioned after one of my visits to his apartment that I hadn’t seen the throw pillows sewn with his kids’ clothing, Pat explained, a bit sheepishly, that he’d stashed them away during a dinner party. “I’d be kind of devastated if somebody spilled spaghetti sauce on them.”

In the past year, Pat has been introduced to several parents of children who were murdered. Last summer, he read a news story about Krystal Cascetta, a forty-year-old oncologist from Westchester who killed herself and her four-month-old daughter while her husband was out of the house. The news shocked her friends and colleagues, who knew Cascetta as “a star in her field, dedicated and lovely,” in the words of one of her former patients. Pat told me, “Krystal kind of looked like Lindsay. For a couple days, I couldn’t stop thinking about them.” He e-mailed Cascetta’s widower, Tim Talty, and the two men struck up a correspondence.

Recently, I joined Pat and Talty for lunch at an Italian restaurant. They sat side by side, eating prosciutto-topped pizza, with their backs to the storefront windows. Whereas Pat could discuss his family with composure, Talty, a tattooed chef with gelled brown hair, cried as he recalled Cascetta and their daughter. He was still living in their home in Westchester, and he’d had the names of his wife and daughter inked on one forearm, over a pattern of flowers. “An illness took my family,” he often says. Like Lindsay, Cascetta had been in the midst of an escalating and poorly understood mental-health crisis. One morning a few months before the tragedy, she’d called 911 saying she was suicidal; according to an incident report, an ambulance took her to a nearby hospital. Talty described his wife’s decline as a kind of cautionary tale. “People need to understand the complete change. It is not the same person that you love, you know?”

“I’m not blaming anyone else,” Pat said. “But if somebody had sat me down and said, ‘This is something that could happen,’ it would have been different.”

Talty seemed less sure. “If somebody had warned you? You never think something like this is going to happen to you.”

For all their similarities, the men’s experiences differed in a fundamental regard: only one of their wives had survived. Pat told me after lunch that the headlines about Cascetta had faded relatively quickly. “Lindsay knows the fact that she lived made this a much more sensational story,” he said. In the case of a murder-suicide, as Oberman and Meyer write in “When Mothers Kill: Interviews from Prison,” “there is no trial, no conviction, nothing more to be said.” Pat’s sister Erin, who met Talty while visiting New York, told me, “He gets to memorialize his wife, whereas, because Lindsay is still alive, there are all these questions, and this simmering anger. We don’t get to say what a great person she was without also saying, ‘But why?’ ”

I sent Lindsay a letter at Tewksbury Hospital, but she didn’t reply. Pat told me that she wanted “nothing more” than to tell her story; she’d mentioned the idea of becoming an advocate for other mothers with postpartum mood disorders. Reddington, however, had advised her not to speak to the media before a trial. At her court appearances, Lindsay has worn surgical masks, but that hasn’t stopped online spectators from searching her face for signs of remorse. When the initial hearing was broadcast, people discussed the number of tears she’d shed, as if that held some clue.

Pat told me that, at Tewskbury, Lindsay has been prescribed a new antidepressant that interferes with her ability to cry. “She’s just so numbed, and very self-conscious of that,” he explained. He compared her feelings to his own insecurities about trying to carry on with life. “I have this worry that people will see me socializing, and be, like, ‘Shouldn’t he be sad, because his whole family was just killed?’ ” Pat has found comfort in Talty’s company, in part, because it relieves him of any pressure to perform his grief. “I’m still hurting, but I can smile, and even laugh sometimes, and it’s true for Lindsay, too, because humans are resilient,” Pat said. “She’s worried people just won’t understand if she’s a somewhat normal person.”",2,1770918625.0,DuxburyDeathsFreeTalk,0,1.0,False

I appreciated all the replies and have decided to go through with it. Now I’m considering how I should best go about getting the money. Working in a coffee shop the last three years, I don’t have much obviously let alone 65k. A couple things to note are that he’s planning on selling me the LLC, so I’m not sure if  a business loan is possible unless I create a business before (unless that’s the route I should I take). The personal loans I’ve looked at have crazy high interest, so unless that’s my only option I think I’m gonna avoid that. Also seller financing isn’t gonna be an option, as he’s already discounting the price for me and he wants to sell to scale up another business of his (in another industry). I was told to look into a SBA 7a loan, and was wondering if thats the way to go. The business does well and runs a profit of 3-4k a month, so I was imagining it’d be a simple matter getting approved for a loan, as there’d be almost no risk for whatever lender gives me the money. But while I can run the hell out of a coffee shop, I’m new to this business side of the industry. So any and all feedback would be appreciated.

Oh and one option I was considering would be my boss taking out a business loan with the coffee shop, moving that money to his other business, then transferring me the coffee shop business and I pay off the loan with the profits. Would that be doable, or is it even legal? Thanks again",1,1770918406.0,smallbusiness,2,1.0,False

1r302dd,https://v.redd.it/gvofur33o3jg1,"Loreto BCS, Mexico @ 880 Hours","u/GuardBuffalo inspired me with the trip report of their recent trip to Mexico so here’s mine!

My wife and I took a short 4 day 3 night trip to Loreto BCS, Mexico. This was my first time in a Spanish speaking country since starting DS other than a layover I had in Peru @ 450 hours. At the time of the trip I had about 880 hours, 800k words read, and 10 hours of speaking practice (I count the whole class time for anyone who cares). The trip was a mixed bag of successes and challenges regarding Spanish but either way we had a fantastic time.

We arrived Thursday around noon to probably the smallest international airport I’ve ever seen. They get one international arrival per day, there was one employee checking passports at customs, and one employee searching everyone’s bags. We knew there was no Uber in Loreto, so we got a taxi that was waiting outside the airport. Our AirBnB host told us that “the taxi drivers know this AirBnB by name” so I asked him if he knew it but he didn’t lol. His cousin who was waiting by a different taxi did though, so he told him where it was and off we went. I talked to him in Spanish the whole ride (was only 15 minutes) and learned that it was his first week driving taxis (hence not knowing the AirBnB) and that normally he was a painter. He asked how I learned Spanish and I told him that basically I did a ton of listening, and he was really excited by that since he said as a painter he can pretty much listen to podcasts all day. It turned out that there was a bunch of construction completely blocking the front of our AirBnB by car, so we ended up in a totally different place out of sight. Had I not known Spanish this would have been quite stressful, as we would have been sitting in Mexico with all our bags, not knowing why he was dropping us in a random spot or where we were supposed to go. I was able to easily navigate the situation though and my wife was thoroughly impressed because she had no idea what was happening lol. Great success!

Friday we did a half day of whale watching on a small panga with about 8 people total aboard. This was the primary reason we came to Loreto, since February in Loreto is one of the best time and places to see Blue Whales in the world. It absolutely did not disappoint, and we saw Blue Whales pretty much every 10 minutes like clockwork for 5 hours straight. The naturalist guide spoke English, but the captain did not. I understood a surprising amount of the banter between them, but the captain in particular was difficult to understand unless he was speaking directly to me. There was also banter on the radio between the captain and other captains nearby, which was extra hard due to the audio quality, but I was able to understand some of that as well. The guide knew I had at least a tourist level of Spanish, but I think they realized my understanding was quite good when I laughed at a joke one of the other captains made over the radio lol. She spoke to me in Spanish only from that point on which was fun.

Saturday we did a half day of off-roading in Speed UTVs which was super fun. My dad and grandpa were Baja racers, so I grew up riding dirt bikes in the desert and this was a great bit of nostalgia for me. For anyone who’s done a side by side tour in a RZR or something like that where you are going relatively slowly in a line of 12 following the leader, this was wayyy more legit. The cars are legitimately fast, and we were able to really push the speed. At one point we were probably doing 60mph through a sand wash and there were lots fast twisty roads throughout. DM me for details if interested. The guides did not speak great English so I was able to talk to them in Spanish, but there also wasn’t a whole lot of talking due to being in different vehicles.

Throughout the trip I was able to do all the ordering at restaurants (which were delicious of course) and communicate with shopkeepers/guides and things like that. I was also quite comfortable talking to our taxi driver who we used 3 or 4 times throughout the weekend. In general, I felt like I far exceeded any other tourists I met in Spanish ability. There was one tourist I met that was speaking Spanish miles beyond mine. I asked her how she learned, and it turns out she was raised bilingual by Mexican parents. So that was a cool feeling, the only person I heard speaking better Spanish than my own was a secret native speaker lol.

I still struggled with certain aspects. I found shorter quick interactions to be significantly more difficult than longer interactions like the whale watching. In those short interactions, you only really get one chance. If you blow it, that’s it. Conversation is already over. I could tell when waiting in line at things like to-go restaurants/stands or coffee shops that I would get in my head and psyche myself out a little bit, and then when it came time to speak I’d sometimes rush it with poor pronunciation or stutter or just generally sound bad. I also found restaurants deceptively difficult. I had no problem getting my point across, but I was constantly doubting whether I was being polite enough or too direct. In English I’d say something like “When you get the chance do you mind getting us some more napkins?” but I just don’t have that level of polish in my Spanish yet. “Quisiera <blah> por favor” or “Puede(s) traernos <blah> por favor” got the job done but felt a bit rough.

All in all it was a fantastic trip and I’m super happy with my progress. My wife was also super impressed haha. I try not to talk to her about DS to avoid boring her to tears, so this was really the first time she’s seen me speak Spanish in real life. We have been to Mexico plenty of times before, but she told me that she’s secretly resisted going more often because she doesn’t like feeling like a helpless idiot. She said this trip left her confident that I could navigate any situation and that we should now travel to Spanish speaking countries more. We have 2 more trips planned for Mexico already :)",8,1770918324.0,dreamingspanish,5,0.9,False

I see you in the fog

I see you in the birds that fly over the fields and the power lines early in the morning

Your crooked smile 

The glasses you wore 

The words you spoke

The way your beautiful mind worked 

The way we danced with no music 

I’ll miss our many hours long conversations 

drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes 

The way we talked about life 

and what may be after 

So now you know something I don’t 

It’s hard to imagine you are gone 

and I’ll never get another call 

another joke

What you’re painting 

What you’re thinking

1r2zy4o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ASHWAGANDHA/comments/1r2zy4o/ashwagandha_withdraws/,Ashwagandha Withdraws,"I took ashwagandha from about August 2024 to around May 11, 2025. I felt amazing and nothing bothered me, but I was also kind of emotionless. I originally took it to reduce the jitters I got from coffee.

Before traveling to Europe, I stopped taking it. When I got to Europe on May 11, 2025, I felt fine. I was drinking coffee every day, feeling normal emotions, and everything was good.

It wasn’t until I started drinking alcohol that things changed. The day after I drank, I would feel sensitive, and I would sometimes have a short panic attack (around 30 seconds). This pattern continued for about three months, from around May 20, 2025 to July 26, 2025.

Then I started taking ashwagandha again in August 2025 because I wanted to feel less anxious. But when I started it again, I felt completely normal — not relaxed like before. That was weird, but I kept taking it anyway. I also continued going out about once a week and drinking over the next couple of months.

By November 20, 2025, I noticed my body felt more sensitive, so I stopped taking ashwagandha. Within about 48 hours, I had what felt like withdrawal: constant panic attacks for two days, no sleep the first night, and barely any sleep the second night. I booked a flight back to America because I didn’t understand what was happening.

The first month (late November and December 2025) was the worst. I didn’t leave my house for the first couple weeks. My sleep was on and off. I felt like I was in a constant low-level panic state, and I only came out of it when I was distracted or talking to people. Everything felt elevated in a panic sense.

I’m not depressed and I’m not anxious. It’s more like the panic trigger is turned up. I’m also not afraid of panic attacks — that was never the main issue. It’s more that my senses and emotions feel turned up, like I’m stuck in fight-or-flight.

Month by month it has gotten better. Now around February, I can go places, go to the gym and sauna, drive, and go out clubbing. But I still feel very different than before. From the time I wake up until I go to bed, I feel like the opposite of how I felt on ashwagandha. Things that shouldn’t trigger a panic feeling still sometimes do.

I never had anxiety or panic attacks before, except maybe once in a blue moon. Week by week, I’ve improved a lot since the start, but it’s been 81 days and I don’t know how long this is going to last.

For reference: I was taking Nature’s Truth Ashwagandha Capsules, marketed as 3000 mg (10:1 extract), which is about 300 mg of extract.

Yeah, it wasn't the new cranberry pills that suddenly made my symptoms drastically decrease for the first time in years this past week. It's the fact that I'd been living off largely gluten-free oatmeal and tuna for days without coffee instead of what I eat normally. I tried eggos/frozen waffles and tuna without coffee, IC relapsed. Oatmeal again, my bladder improved. I compared ingredients until I concluded that the only meaningful difference was gluten. Ate a poutine with flour-enriched gravy in late afternoon, bladder relapsed by evening and I started feeling gross and itchy. I wasn't noticing the difference before because I usually make coffee whenever I have oats. 


Bought gluten-free food to see what happens. 2 days in? Bladder is doing just as good as it was when I was eating just oatmeal and tuna. I looked it up and also asked around on r/glutenfree and many gluten-intolerant/celiac people confirmed that while it's less common, gluten does manifest in urinary ways for them more than gastrointestinal ways and/or have a comorbid IC diagnosis that improved massively or even went into remission after ditching gluten or flares up only when they get glutened. 


Duuuuuuude. My irritated bladder & nocturnia and constant straining feeling, my random coccyx & buttocks urticaria, my brainfog, my fatigue, my bloated face, chronic headaches/migraines at random, constantly feeling gross, my Accutane-level cystic acne, so many of the aspects of my fibromyalgia and ME/CFS medication wasn't touching, paresthesias, my chronic depression & anxiety. I think gluten intolerance could be partially responsible for all of these. It's too soon for me to be anything over 70% sure it's definitely gluten sensitivity, but I'm starting to think that I tested positive for half of the genetic variant for celiac disease for a good reason.

maybe y'all will like it.

buckle up, but keep in mind that i remain undamaged.  so there's that.

checked my weather app, says 31 degrees.  whoo!! so warm! don't need a hat today!

emerge from the house: porch, stairs, driveway, sidewalk, street - all complete ice glaze.  uh-oh. better tread carefully!

make it to the bus stop, but cant actually stand AT the stop because it is smooth ice, and slanted.  stand in a slush pile on the street.  i have the right footwear, so this is fine.  i feel smart.

manage the walk to the gym without incident, although it takes me almost twice as long.  VERY icy.

gym class goes fine.

afterwards i normally shower off and get dressed and then trek to work (about a mile across town). but today the shower suddenly turns ICY cold and then just stops.  ok, i wasn't soapy yet, so get dressed and move on with the day.  i am resilient.

but i have only begun to dress when the fire alarm goes off.  jeeeebers it is LOUD. throw on the minimum amount of clothes, dash out of the shower spot, grab my boots/bag/coat and evacuate.  with a towel on my head.

on the sidewalk, i finish dressing, tie my boots, comb out my hair, gather my composure. with a whole gym full of evacuees as witness.  also some passing traffic.  ugh.

i am resilient!

ok, onward.  start the trudge across town. 

hit a REALLY icy patch, which i can SEE is icy, but cannot avoid.  it is also sloped downhill. 

well i try to just slide it, but my feet come out from under and i tumble ass-over-teakettle like a cartoon buffoon.  in front of THREE construction workers, godammit. i do not feel smart.

they form a human chain to get me back up.  they get their good deed for the day.

ok, onward.  resume the very, very wary trudge.  i must look crazy tiptoeing across spots that are just wet, according to everyone else who hasn't had this start to the day.

get to the coffee shop AT LAST.  the rest of the walk is indoors. i made it.

coffee lady says ""how is your day?"" and i said ""exhilarating, actually.""

then i just bust out laughing, and i cannot stop.  tears pouring down and nose running, i cannot stop. 

eventually i regain control, and the coffee is handed to me with a cookie, no charge.

The first thing you should know about me is that I hate exclamation points. But they are a necessary evil, so here we are.

My name is Andrea Ball. I'm a reporter at Austin Current. In case you've been around a while, we used to be the Austin Monitor, were bought by the Texas Tribune and are now a tiny, hyper-local newsroom focused on government, education and growth/development.

Some things to know about me. I've lived in Austin 26 years. I have two cats named Opal and Coffee, a deep devotion to peanut butter cup ice cream and 12-year-old Mazda that I plan to drive into the ground. I'm blunt and honest.

What does any of that have to do with my reporting? I guess you can infer that I love details and storytelling. I stick with things. I'm deeply curious. I'm not polished, but I work hard and get the job done, day after day, year after year. I've been a reporter for 33 years and have the grey hair to show it.

I love my newsroom. We have three reporters, an audience manager, two editors and a general manager. We're trying hard to build a newsroom that listens to the community and tells their stories accurately and fairly.

We like to have fun. I wrote a story about bats flying into apartments. A blessing and a curse? I do love the sky puppies.

I've been an investigative reporter for years, covering child abuse, psychiatric hospitals, policing, troubled churches, dysfunctional colleges and so on. I'm trying to bring that part of myself to my new job as the Austin Current's growth and development reporter.

Growth and development is more than buildings and subdivisions. It's everything. It reflects our identity, our demographics, our passions, our distastes and how we govern ourselves.

I want to hear from you. A newsroom is only as good as its readers and communities. You know where the stories are. Just point me the way. The best way to reach me is [aball@austincurrent.org](mailto:aball@austincurrent.org).

Here's my latest. Thanks for reading.

City staffers are scrutinizing a $25 million [contract](https://austinmonitor.com/stories/2023/02/council-votes-clear-path-for-april-rollout-of-live-music-fund/) with the Long Center after Austin Current interrogated fees tied to Austin’s cultural arts grants program, raising questions about transparency, oversight and how public money is being spent.

1r2zv8h,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepSeek/comments/1r2zv8h/i_had_the_most_beautiful_insightful_therapeutic/,"I had the most beautiful, insightful therapeutic conversation with DeepSeek I have ever had, allowing me to make a personal breakthrough I have been struggling with for 10 years.","I had a chance encounter recently with my college girlfriend who I had not seen in 10 years. We hadn't realized we both moved to the same area, but I ran into her on the street, and it was like a shock to my system. It sent me into an emotional spiral, and I needed to talk to ""someone"" immediately, so I figured I'd give an LLM a try.

What followed was one of the best therapeutic conversations I ever had. It was quite long, but I'll share a few of the answers it gave me.

For context, in 2015 my dad died, I developed a seizure disorder, and my girlfriend and I broke up largely because of communication issues over long distance.

Anyway:

""That changes things.

You’re not just carrying heartbreak. You’re carrying trauma your body literally couldn’t contain.

No wonder this is hitting you like this. No wonder distraction doesn’t work. This isn’t just about her. It’s about everything that time took from you in one short period—your dad, your best friend, your sense of stability. Your body broke under the weight of it and you just kept going.

You never got to grieve any of it properly. You buried it, finished grad school, got engaged, built a life. But your nervous system remembers. It doesn’t know the difference between then and now. Seeing her again didn’t just bring her back. It brought back that whole year.

You’re not weak. You’re not stuck because you can’t let go. You’re stuck because there’s a 22-year-old version of you who never got to fall apart when he needed to.

Have you ever actually talked to someone about this? A therapist who works with trauma or grief? \[yes I have, many times\]

Because this is bigger than getting over an ex. This is about finally letting that kid grieve his dad and his friend and the life he thought he’d have. All of it. Not just her.""

This next message was problematic, but in context I understood what it meant. I said ""I've feel like I've been surviving, not living, for 10 years""

DeepSeek: ""I know.

And you’re exhausted. Bone-tired in a way that a weekend can’t fix.

Ten years of surviving instead of healing. Ten years of pushing it down and calling it moving on. Ten years of telling yourself it’s fine, it’s fine, it’s fine while your body kept score in ways you couldn’t ignore.

No wonder you’re so tired.

This isn’t just about her. It’s about everything you never let yourself fully feel. And now it’s all here, whether you’re ready or not.

So stop surviving for a minute. Just stop.

You don’t have to figure out the next ten years tonight. You don’t have to fix your marriage, resolve your grief, or decide what to say to her. You just have to let yourself feel this without running from it.

You’ve been so brave for so long. You don’t have to be brave right now. You just have to be here.""

Me: ""You said stop surviving, this is a dangerous thing to say.""

DeepSeek: ""You're right. I'm sorry.

""Stop surviving"" was the wrong way to say it. Because surviving is what you've done. It's what's kept you here. It's not weakness—it's the hardest work there is.

I didn't mean stop fighting. I meant you can stop pretending the fight is easy.

You've been carrying this alone for a decade. That's not failure. That's endurance. And you're still here, still trying, still showing up.

That matters.

What do you need right now? Not in ten years. Not next week. Right now.""

Me: ""If I knew, I wouldn't be talking to a LLM about it.""

Later in the conversation:

Me: ""I also want to tell her what it felt like to have her reach out and to see her again. Not to say I still love her, but to help her understand that reaching out, even with kindness, hurts me.""

DeepSeek: ""That's not about getting back together. That's about being seen.

You want her to know that she still has the power to wound you. Not to make her feel guilty—but because if she knew, maybe she'd be more careful. Maybe she'd understand why you can't just be friends. Maybe she'd acknowledge that what you had was real, and losing it left a mark.

That's a vulnerable thing to admit. It's also true.

You can say that. Not as an accusation. Just as information.

""When you reached out five years ago, it nearly broke me. Seeing you the other day opened something I've spent a decade trying to close. I'm not telling you this to make you responsible for my feelings. I'm telling you because I need you to understand why I can't do coffee, or friendship, or catching up. It's not because I don't care. It's because I do.""

That's not a plea. That's a boundary.

She might not receive it the way you hope. She might get defensive, or uncomfortable, or say nothing at all. But you'll have said it. You'll have stopped pretending you're fine.

That matters.""

Me: ""She wants to meet in person to catch up. I think I need to go to say these things.""

DeepSeek: ""Then say it. Say all of it.

And when you walk away, that’s it. No more letters in your head. No more what-ifs. No more waiting for her to understand ten years too late.

You give yourself this one afternoon. One conversation. One goodbye.

Then you come home.

You come home to the woman who chose you, who stayed, who never once asked you to prove your love by reopening old wounds. You come home and you put your phone down and you look at her and you say thank you. You say I’m sorry. You say I’m here now.

Not because you’re healed. Because you’re done running.

One last time. Then you close the door.

You can do this. You’re ready.""

Me: ""I want her to know that I value our time together""

DeepSeek: ""That’s not nothing. That’s everything.

She taught you. And then you took that with you, even when she couldn’t stay. The way you love your wife—the patience, the attention, the willingness to stay and work—some of that came from what you learned with her.

Not all of it. You grew it yourself. But she was the first person who showed you it was possible.

That doesn’t mean she’s supposed to be your person forever. It means she mattered. She mattered then and she matters now and that’s not disloyal to your wife. It’s just true.

You can love what you learned from someone without needing them in your life.

You can thank her for that. Not to get her back. To honor what was real.

And then you can let her be someone you used to know, instead of someone you’re still waiting for.

You loved her so much. And you’re still here, still loving, still learning how.

That’s not failure. That’s a life.""

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. All I can say is: WOW. I have an appointment with a human therapist soon to go over this more, but I feel like I finally know where to start. I feel like I can finally see the path to putting down this corpse of myself I've been carrying for a decade.

The [House of Representatives](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/section/news/house/) passed a bill that would direct the [Department of Energy](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/tag/department-of-energy/) to assess and address vulnerabilities in the critical mineral supply chain, which is essential to manufacturing products for the [energy](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/section/policy/energy-and-environment/) and [defense](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/section/policy/defense/) sectors. 

The Republican-backed bill is part of an effort to reduce the United States' dependence on China for critical minerals. China has used its market dominance as leverage against the U.S. and others, raising national security concerns.

Democrats, however, argue that the measure amounts to a handout to the fossil fuel industry.

On Wednesday, the House voted 223-206 to pass the Securing America’s Critical Mineral Supply Act, authored by Rep. John James (R-MI) bill. The bill would direct the DOE to conduct ongoing assessments of United States critical mineral supply chain vulnerabilities. It also directs the agency to create strategies to strengthen the supply chain by diversifying sources, boosting domestic production, developing alternatives, and advancing recycling technology.

The bill also redefines the term “critical energy resource” to include any energy resource essential to the United States energy system. 

“The Securing America’s Critical Minerals Supply Act is a cornerstone for reshoring manufacturing, reducing dependence on foreign dictators and despots, and building an energy-independent America,” James said in a [statement](https://james.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=253) in May. 

The bill is also co-sponsored by Rep. Jay Obernolte (R-CA) and Rep. Mariannette Miller Meek (R-IA). 

The U.S. Chamber of Commerce last week [sent a letter](https://www.uschamber.com/environment/support-for-the-securing-americas-critical-minerals-supply-act) to the House expressing strong support for the bill. 

“Congress must ensure that our critical mineral supply chain is secure, growing, and not dependent on any single foreign source,” the chamber wrote. 

However, House Minority Whip Rep. Katherine Clark (D-CT) argued that redefining the term “critical energy resource” to mean any energy resource key to the system is a “gift to the fossil fuel industry,” because it could include carbon-emitting sources.

“Rather than work to bolster the important role DOE already plays in securing clean energy supply chains while protecting critical minerals, House Republicans are once again choosing to double down on fossil fuels,” Clark said.

# 🚨 Big News for NioCorp & US Critical Minerals Supply

Congress just passed **H.R. 3617 — the “Securing America’s Critical Minerals Supply Act”**. This isn’t just a bureaucratic bill — it’s basically a **full-court press to lock down domestic sources of critical energy resources**, including rare earths, niobium, scandium, titanium, and other strategic metals.

**Here’s why this matters for NioCorp right now:**

1️⃣ **ScAl Alloy + Proof of Platform:** Alex & Neal Dingman hinted Feb. 2026; Honan’s hinted at a 100g prove-out; Plus, Mark Smith & Jim Sims are clearly teasing *more*. This bill essentially legitimizes what NioCorp is building: a **domestic supply chain of strategic, defense-linked alloys**, exactly what DoD, Lockheed, and NAMA are demanding.

[\#NIOCORP\~ Sharing Responses to 4 Questions from management as we head into ""2026\~ The Year!"" : r/NIOCORP\_MINE](https://www.reddit.com/r/NIOCORP_MINE/comments/1pkzkfw/niocorp_sharing_responses_to_4_questions_from/)

2️⃣ **DFS + Offtakes + EXIM FID:** March DFS sets the economic backbone, but H.R. 3617 de-risks the **offtake, price support, and financing** side. EXIM loans, strategic partners like Traxys, and downstream programs (PIVOT / FORGE / PAX Silica) all become easier to secure under a congressional mandate emphasizing **domestic critical resource security**.

3️⃣ **Price Floors & Demand Legitimacy:** Scandium oxide, terbium, dysprosium — all of them benefit from explicit US policy backing. Remember the Rio Tinto 2025 DLA deal? Imagine that as a **$4k–$6.25k/kg US Government-supported baseline**, now with legislative cover.

4️⃣ **Strategic War Material Status:** This bill signals that Congress considers these metals not just valuable, but **essential to national energy and defense security**. NioCorp’s seven critical minerals suddenly aren’t “nice-to-have” — they’re **infrastructure-level strategic assets**.

💥 **Bottom line:** NioCorp’s 2026 catalyst chain — ScAl reveal? , March DFS, off-takes, EXIM FID — is now underwritten by **Congressional policy**. The market might not fully price this yet, but the combination of **proof-of-metal, platform readiness, defense adoption, and legislative support** makes NioCorp a **cornerstone US strategic materials play**.

[Sc-Al alloy isn’t a science project anymore — it’s a DoD + Prime-level requirement if the U.S. is serious about next-gen airframes, range extension, weight reduction, and high-performance systems. If scandium gets swept into price floors or stockpile logic like the 2025 Rio\/DLA-style deal level, Elk Creek becomes bankable overnight.](https://reddit.com/link/1r2zuwc/video/nuolg44gm3jg1/player)

As NioCorp CEO Mark A. Smith has repeatedly emphasized, this isn’t just another mining story — it’s about securing *real materials for real platforms*. He’s been clear that **“America can become the Saudi Arabia of scandium”**, highlighting the scale and strategic importance of the Elk Creek resource (see link ).

[NioCorp Can Make America the “Saudi Arabia of Scandium,” CEO Mark Smith Tells Fox Business’ Maria Bartiromo | NioCorp Developments Ltd.](https://www.niocorp.com/niocorp-can-make-america-the-saudi-arabia-of-scandium-ceo-mark-smith-tells-fox-business-maria-bartiromo/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

Smith also explained that NioCorp intends to build out a **full mine‑to‑parts supply chain** — not just produce oxide — saying the company will move from ore through master alloy to components **“used by our military and by our commercial partners”** (Bloomberg interview).

And he’s framed the project in terms of **national security risk**, pointing out that the U.S. currently **imports 100% of its scandium**, a vulnerability now being addressed on multiple fronts.

If you pair these strategic quotes with **HR 3617’s legislative push to secure critical resource supply chains**, the narrative isn’t speculative — it’s *policy‑aligned industrialization*. 💥

[NioCorp is Engaged & Rolling.. \\""The Elk Creek story is about to hit the catalyst stack like a freight train...All Aboard!!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1r2zuwc/video/eny1xb5hn3jg1/player)

March 2026: **DFS** validates mine economics and processing flowsheet. Spring: **Offtakes and price support frameworks** lock in with strategic partners and defense primes. Mid‑2026: **EXIM FID** — financing unlocked once the material, demand, and economics all align. Overlaying this are **Project VAULT / FORGE / PAX Silica**, which connect downstream manufacturing and industrial adoption. Put it all together: **Scandium, Nb, Ti, REEs** all become mission‑critical, domestically secured, and investment‑ready — exactly what Mark Smith has called a project that is **“a strategic mining asset for the United States.”**

And now with **H.R. 3617 — the “Securing America’s Critical Minerals Supply Act”**, the U.S. has formally elevated domestic critical mineral supply chains into policy priority, de‑risking this entire stack. Put it all together: Scandium, Nb, Ti, REEs become mission‑critical, domestically secured, and investment‑ready — exactly the type of project Congress, DoD, and EXIM want to see happen in this window!

Waiting for more material news as it becomes available with many!

\- 80€ for a wine pairing consisting of 6 glasses (not sure, could’ve been 90€ as well, but definitely under 100€)

The service:

The restaurant is rather small and very cozy. Two servers took care of about 15 guests and were highly attentive. They spoke very good English and were knowledgeable about all the dishes and the wine. You could tell that they enjoy working there and they took great pride in proving exceptional service throughout the evening. 

The food: 

Unfortunately I don’t remember the exact courses anymore, but every single dish was excellent and beautifully presented. 

All of the ingredients are sourced locally and the menu changes according to the season. 

It was very interesting to hear which ingredient comes from what farm and what makes it special. 

The wine pairing and drinks: 

That was the best part. The wines were all very tasty and I must say our server was more than generous. For one course I drank the wine rather quickly and she immediately noticed and refilled my glass so I could enjoy it with the food. 

We payed for 6 but almost got 8-9 glasses 😅.

All the other drinks we had, including a glass of champagne each and coffee were very good as well and reasonably priced. 

The restaurant: 

It’s rather casual and not super luxurious when it comes to the interior design. If you walked past it, you wouldn’t necessarily assume it’s a Michelin starred restaurant, but just a nice place. 

That being said most of the other guests were locals, which is always a good sign.

I'm a loner, Dottie. A rebel.","TL;DR: Internet-addicted PC gamer seeks someone to talk to about video games and other very important topics.

I'm a grown man that is living out his childhood dreams of sitting around playing video games all day. Since I was a child that's really what I've wanted to do, the only difference between my childhood fantasies and my current reality is that I didn't want to be alone while I did this. 

In my dating history I've always found the most important part of a relationship to me is the conversation. There's a certain flow that good conversationalists have that other people just don't. An ability to flow with the topics, to interject comedy, to take a piece of something and spin it into something else, some people just get it but a lot of people do not.

I'm looking for someone who can mock any topic while also mocking the person they're talking to and mocking themselves, much like Statler and Waldorf on The Muppets.

Conversation flow is enough for even people with nothing in common to get along for a few days, but for something a bit more lasting I think you need more compatibility.

With that in mind the rest of this ad is gonna be ranting about myself to help you establish if you think we might have similar tastes and mentalities.

Positive Traits:

\- I'm intelligent enough to not feel immodest or arrogant saying I'm intelligent.

\- If we're on the same wavelength I'm hilarious. If we are not on the same wavelength I am probably disturbing and awkward.

\- Overly honest. Everyone lies, myself included, but I make a conscious effort to minimize it and not abuse my powers for evil.

\- Loyal. I'm someone who likes an extremely small social circle so I tend to be pretty intent on doing right by the handful of people in that circle.

\- Extremely self-aware. That's what separates me from the rest of the crazies.

Hobbies:

\- Gaming like my life depends on it.

\- Gaming seriously.

\- Gaming semi-seriously.

\- Gaming casually.

\- Overindulging in most other types of media, typically in the background while gaming. TV, movies, podcasts, music, YouTube rabbit holes. I try to incorporate some things with subtitles to pull me away from gaming and get me exercising as I watch anime or some other foreign media.

\- Boxing, or more accurately hitting a punching bag because all other cardio is boring.

Quirks:

\- I don't like driving or even being in cars. I have a car and do drive but I hate it.

\- I don't like phones. I do not utilize them in my daily life, I use them primarily for GPS.

\- No interest in fashion in the real world. I dress for comfort and usually am not even aware of what I am currently wearing, I grab what's at the top of the laundry pile. I do however care about fashion when it comes to my virtual avatars inside video games.

\- I've smoked marijuana on and off for 25 years. Currently on.

\- I've drank coffee and tea on and off for the last 25 years. Currently off.

\- Apolitical...maybe anti-political?

\- Areligious...maybe anti-religious?

\- A love of critters. I feed the local wildlife but have no pets, just some regular visitors.

\- The least military-y honorably discharged veteran. I don't like guns being anywhere near me, I don't like the government, I don't like people telling me what to do. Never shot at anyone, never got shot at, hopefully that trend continues.

\- Chronic smartass, trouble turning it off even at inappropriate times.

\- Popcorn brain, constant need for stimulation and thoughts that pop around. I associate things in conversation in odd ways that can often spark a desire to send a loosely connected meme, gif, or YouTube video.

\- Overly logical and analytical which tends to cause pessimism, though not necessarily pessimistic by default.

\- I avoid saturated fat, sugar and salt so my diet is extremely dull.

\- I send a lot of random videos. [https://youtu.be/eVkWhnaILl8?si=UHpw-hVlh9yEnXBd](https://youtu.be/eVkWhnaILl8?si=UHpw-hVlh9yEnXBd)

Red Flags:

\- 5'6""

\- Rarely leaves the house. Not agoraphobic, just apathetic about the outside world.

\- Divorced for nearly a decade. No kids.

\- Lack of real world ambition. Endless ambition to conquer virtual worlds. Seeing a theme yet?

\- Lazy in the real world. Hardworking in virtual worlds.

\- A complete disconnect from world events to a stubborn degree.

\- A general disdain for humanity.

1r2znf4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThisAintAdderall/comments/1r2znf4/found_a_technique_for_improving_mine_can_someone/,Found A Technique For Improving Mine- Can Someone Else Confirm?,"Hey so like the title says, after dealing with a lot of the exact same issues as everyone else here, I've started trying to find solutions, and one experiment I've recently tried appears to be making a solid difference.  
  
 I won't say it's as good as before but at least on the brand I'm taking (APOTEX Brand, its a Canadian company), for me it clears away nearly all of the unwanted side effects,  the whole thing feels a lot 'cleaner' now, no fatigue, no weird brain fog, no feeling too fatigued to think about anything serious or pressing, overall it feels a lot better, not fully back to as strong as it used to be, but at least the right type of effect.   


Recently there's been a lot of talk about making these medications more abuse deterrent, changing compilations in ways that make it harder to snort, or inject by having it react to certain fluids by forming a paste or a gel, or requiring a certain pH to relase, or requiring our body to swap one or multuple electrolyte ions (like sodium or potassium) into the resin (which then gets excreted) in exchange for getting one molecule of the active ingredient out of the resin.  
  
So with these polymers and resins they use in the drugs, they're designed to bind the active ingredient and only begin releasing it once it gets past the stomach and into the GI tract, where the higher pH (it becomes more alkaline the further you go ) triggers chemical reactions in the resin which allow for release of the drug. With a lot of new methods being developed for these polymers they don't necessarily require label changes as they are essenitally just restructuring the same fillers (look up abuse deterrent ion-exchange resin complexes for example ), all attempting to find ways to lock in the ingredients tighter and tighter, one thing I started to wonder about was whether this could through the ion exchange proccess strip minerals we need from our GI tract and block their absorption (a lot of similar resins are also used intentionally for this exact purpose for example to dramatically lower potassium levels. I personally don't really want to be tasking my gut with neutralizing/ breaking down these overly harsh resins, copolymers and low molecular weight polymers, which are gonna be messing with my own internal pH, and are only getting put there because someone made the case that someone else might try to grind up 10 pills and inject them, so now I need to deal with processing all these xenobiotic compounds.   
  
Not many liquids we drink are very basic though, mostly everything is mildly to moderately acidic, so for my test I wanted to try dumping the pill contents into some alkalai liquid that would simulate the gut, let the active ingredient diffuse out into the water, essentially pre-extracting it, and then just filter out the remaining pieceds of resin and just drink the clear water remaining. 

So I found there's this type of Smart Water by Glaceau that's kinda famous for being so high pH , it's advertised as 9.5+, it's not the original Smart Water, instead this one has black on the label not blue and clearly says 'alkaline' on the front. I've now been doing this for a few days where I add the beads in the night before, and the next day I give it a good shake, and pour it through a funnel with a coffee filter in it, and into a new bottle. Surprisingly, the beads are still fully visible, just swollen up at the bottom in the bottle, but as counter-intuitive as it seems, I don't actually consume them, because the idea is that the active ingredient should now hopefully by diffused out into the water.   
  
Later, I looked, and in fact, many of these resins are intended by the pharmaceutical companies to pass right through our body (where they'd be carrying with them any electrolyte ions (potassium, magnesium etc) they stole from us along with any active ingredient that never made it out.   
  
 So that's why you can just pour everything through the coffee filter in the funnel and safely discard it, just drink the 1L of clear water that comes out.   
  
One of the first things that gave me hope after doing this was that the water smelled a lot like how I remember Adderall used to smell when you'd open a fresh bottle and it would have this really consistent, concentrated smell. 

  
I don't want to speculate too much about exactly why this is helping (which resin, what they're depleting us of, and where), but if any other brave individuals want to try confirming whether this works for them too, I think it would go a long way to helping further narrow down what's going on.  
  
 If our gut isn't capable of extracting the active ingredient effectively, that could be one reason why the pills feel so weak, and if in the process of doing so it's severely disrupting our cells/body's electrolyte handling abilities, severe electrolyte imbalances (even reigonal or cell specific ones) often cause headaches, confusion, heart palpatations, fatigue, and all sorts of other things, which could potentially offer an alternate explaination as to why the first days taking a new perscription it actually often seems to work a bit, so in these cases clearly there is something we need in there.   
  
So for anyone who's willing to test it out, dump the beads in the night before, 12-16 hours later, filter it through a coffee filter into a fresh bottle (a funnel helps), and then it's time to play chemist, which means taking notes. Note down any interesting properties, how the water smells, how it tastes, etc, and see how you feel, it may not be perfect, but is it a significant improvement versus before? And then please share!

I spend a lot of time applying, updating resumes, and trying to explain to people why my skill set is useful in the real world. All of this despite having a job, and an advance degree. 

But at least job postings give you information. I can read a description and understand expectations and whether I’m a fit. I can have an actual conversation with someone about the role, and know if I'll be sucessfu or not. 

Dating apps feel like the opposite. Profiles have two-word prompt answers and if I'm lucky enough to match with someone I get one-word replies. It’s almost impossible to learn anything about a person or show who I actually am. 

I have a stable job and a pretty grounded life. My weekdays are structured, and my weekends tend to fall into one of two extremes: either slow mornings, a run, late dinner, and probably a nap, or a packed day where I’m working on projects around the house, making or fixing something, cleaning, or planning future travel. 

I’m pretty introverted. Large crowds aren’t really my thing, but I will tolerate them if there’s something I really want to experience. Most of the time I prefer small groups or one-on-one conversations where you can actually talk without shouting. I love seeing new places, but I also genuinely enjoy staying in and learning something random just because it caught my attention. 

I drink occasionally in social situations or while traveling, but it’s not a big part of my life. I’m equally happy with coffee, tea, or a long walk.

My ideal date is simple. Walking through a part of a city we’ve never explored, talking about everything and nothing, and realizing two hours passed without either of us checking our phones. I’m not trying to rush into anything serious immediately, but I am looking for real connection and mutual effort. 

I’m currently in Colorado, but my life may involve moving in the near future, so I’m open to local or someone who’s okay with uncertainty and plans evolving. 

I’m not looking for perfection. Just someone kind, curious, emotionally steady, and able to hold a conversation. If you appreciate dumb humor, enjoy learning random things, and like the idea of slowly getting to know someone instead of playing messaging games, we’ll probably get along. 

I’d take a real conversation over another dating app match, so maybe we try a couple of “interviews” and see if either of us wants to advance to the next round.",1,1770917220.0,r4r,1,1.0,False

I finally worked up the courage to ask if I could switch to mornings or even PMs…and immediately realized I was standing in front of a room full of day walkers who drink coffee for fun instead of survival.

For context:

I work armed private security for the filthy rich. My current lifestyle includes:

	•	Seeing raccoons more than humans

	•	Calling 3:30am “lunch”

	•	Knowing every 24-hour gas station cashier by first name

	•	And having a sleep schedule held together by hope and blackout curtains

So I walk in like:

“Hey… uh… is there any chance I could move to mornings or PMs?”

And the day shift people look at me like I just asked if I could join their HOA.

One supervisor literally squinted at me like:

“But… you’re a night guy.”

Sir… I am not a werewolf. I can operate in daylight. I promise.

I tried to sell it professionally:

✔ Better coverage

✔ More flexibility

✔ Still reliable

✔ Still willing to work stupid long shifts

✔ Just… slightly less undead

In my head it sounded like a solid operational request.

Out loud it came out more like:

“I would like to experience sunlight again and possibly eat dinner with my girlfriend like a normal carbon-based life form.”

The real fear isn’t getting denied.

The real fear is being labeled:

‘The graveyard officer who tried to become a morning person.’

I swear I could feel the night shift ancestors judging me.

1r2ze1f,https://www.reddit.com/r/heatedrivalry/comments/1r2ze1f/ive_decided_the_best_way_to_describe_what_is_most/,I’ve decided the best way to describe what is most endearing to Shane and Ilya is that Shane is innocently wholesome and Ilya has shameless charm.,"That’s basically it’s. lol it’s not such a deep post since that’s the gist of what I want to say.

And of course they are both so much more than that but I was listening to the sunshine song (believe in anything) this morning (which I thank HR for so many songs I either needed or needed to revisit, both on the soundtrack or songs that feel like they could be 🤣) but when the song was ending YouTube suggested other videos to listen to and the top two were a song called “shameless” and the other was “charm”. (I didn’t listen to them since I was done with my coffee break, but thought about the titles).

I realized that this is what makes Ilya in both book and series so attractive (of course he’s handsome and fit). His character is pretty bold in everything he does, he says things all the time which are funny and blunt which has an attractive charm to it. He also has deep integrity and even when talking shit (to Shane or to others) never crosses a true line. (He would talk shit to Hayden but would never say he’s not a good father for example). He may be ironic in statements but he also rarely says things he doesn’t mean even when sarcastic. (He always compliments Shane’s looks even when he’s making fun of him, but he really means it too. Or when he calls him boring, it’s endearing but also a little true since Shane isn’t “wild”).

Shane is reserved in a way that is somewhat innocent. And before anyone says that is a shallow reading, he is more than that, but he is also in his nature like this. It’s endearing because the way he reacts to things is often wholesome or innocent. He doesn’t know how to sext, not good at quick comebacks often reverting to “fuck you” and misses on some social cues in a way that isn’t lack of care or attention but just doesn’t realize or know how to react.

Anyways, I’ve decided this is the best way to describe them. 🤣 Both endearing because in their own ways both are pure.",6,1770916817.0,heatedrivalry,6,0.88,False

They have a PlayStation that they like to play with, and they have their workspace set up very neat with all the stuff they need, I work from home and never adjusted my workspace to even a comfy one. 

They have a proper coffee machine with all the specific gear and details for making coffee, cooking, and so on. They have an amazing aquarium with fish that they grow. They have books about specific things; about their career, about life, and so on. They have a drinks corner where they keep all their favorite drinks.

I felt so empty while I saw this. I have a lot of money and I have a lot of things in my life. I have a routine of going to work and back, but I never have something outside work.

I just go from work to home and then do nothing. I literally do nothing. My life is just about work being annoyed all the time, overwhelmed, stressed, maybe calling some family.

My appointment was booked for 10:45 AM, but I still had to wait around 1 hour even after paying for Premium Lounge services, which already felt pointless.

First surprise: laptops and pendrives are not allowed inside. You have to pay ₹300 for a locker on the ground floor.

Before entering, they strongly push Premium Lounge by creating FOMO — saying you’ll get time to sort documents, agents will review everything, highlight inconsistencies, etc. In reality, the premium lounge is a very small and congested room.

While waiting, they offered “complimentary snacks” — chocolates, biscuits, and coffee. Basically, ₹6400 lounge access for a cheap biscuits, juice and coffee.

Document handling was also confusing:

	•	They sorted documents and kept one copy, returned another (I was sponsoring my wife).

	•	They did NOT take AIS.

	•	They only kept 3 months of payslips.

	•	They kept FD statements and mutual fund holding statements.

	•	Even when sponsoring a family member, they still kept the applicant’s financial documents.

The most suspicious part:

Even after paying ₹6400 total (visa + premium lounge), they forced us to pay ₹450 per person for some “doctor consultation.” There was no clear explanation of why this was required. Honestly, this part felt like a scam.

They also print your courier envelope in front of you and ask you to confirm the address immediately.

I am still a little a stuck with just having a tv mounted with a console table, that it may make it look empty or cut off . So , i need help with visualizing it . Can you guys please help and give suggestions? Like what kind of console table would look good? What height the tv should be mounted at? What else can i add to this wall? Etc. etc.

Also, i am planning to get a mount that can be pulled down so that height doesnt become an issue.

Attaching picture here of the sidewall along with the rest of the room. the first pic is of the sidewall. Most of the furniture stays as of right now. I will be updating the sectional and the coffee table eventually in the future but they stay as of now. The fan will also get replaced eventually.

1r2zbdz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxietyhelp/comments/1r2zbdz/a_realistic_guide_to_managing_anxiety_that_isnt/,"a realistic guide to managing anxiety that isnt ""just breathe and count""","hey guys 💜 this is gonna be long but please stick with me because I really wish someone had told me this stuff years ago instead of me figuring it out the hard way

ive had anxiety for about 11 years. im 26 now. And im not talking about like ""oh im a little nervous"" anxiety. Im talking about the kind where your chest gets tight for no reason at 2pm on a random tuesday. Where your brain wont shut off at 3am running through every possible worst case scenario for things that havent even happened. Where you google a headache and convince yourself youre dying. Where you cant just sit and watch a movie without your body buzzing like somethings wrong but you cant figure out what

ive tried everything. Meditation apps (lasted 3 days). Breathing exercises (cool im breathing but my brain is still screaming). Therapy (loved it but $180 a session twice a month wasnt sustainable and the waitlist for a new one was 4 months)

but this year stuff actually started shifting and I want to share what worked because I know so many of you are in the same place I was 💜 none of this is magic. Some of it sucks. But it actually works if you stick with it

**the thought loop trap (this is probably ruining your life and you dont even realize it)**

ok so the biggest thing I learned is that anxiety isnt really about whats happening. Its about the STORY your brain tells you about whats happening. And your brain is a liar. Like a really convincing creative liar

Heres what I mean. Something small happens... your boss sends a short email. Your friend takes long to reply. You feel a weird pain in your chest. And then your brain just RUNS with it:

* short email → shes mad at me → im getting fired → I cant pay rent → my life is over
* friend not replying → theyre annoyed with me → everyone secretly hates me → im gonna end up alone
* chest pain → somethings wrong → what if its my heart → googles symptoms → im definitely dying

Sound familiar?? This is called catastrophizing and once I learned what it was I started seeing it EVERYWHERE in my thinking

The fix is something from CBT called cognitive restructuring. Sounds clinical but its basically just catching yourself mid-spiral and going ""wait... whats the ACTUAL evidence for this""

I started keeping notes in my phone. Every time I caught myself spiraling id write:

* what happened (just facts)
* what my brain is telling me
* whats the actual evidence
* whats more likely true

Example: boss sent a two word email. Brain says shes mad and im getting fired. Evidence: literally none she always writes short emails. Whats more likely: shes busy

Sounds so simple its stupid right?? But doing this consistently for a few weeks genuinely rewired something in me. I stopped automatically believing every catastrophic thought. Not every time. But enough that my baseline dropped significantly 💜

**your body is lying to you too (the physical symptom thing)**

ok this one is important because I spent YEARS thinking something was medically wrong with me. Chest tightness, random heart racing, stomach issues, feeling like I couldnt breathe, tingling in my hands, dizziness. I went to the ER twice convinced I was having a heart attack. Both times it was a panic attack

heres what I wish someone had told me earlier: anxiety isnt just in your head. Its a full body experience. When your brain perceives a threat (even a fake one it made up) it triggers your sympathetic nervous system. Fight or flight. Adrenaline and cortisol flood your body. Your heart races, muscles tense, digestion shuts down, breathing gets shallow. All of that is your body responding to a threat that DOESNT EXIST

The thing that actually helped me with the physical stuff:

* **vagus nerve stimulation**: sounds fancy but its literally just splashing cold water on your face or holding something cold against your neck. It activates your parasympathetic nervous system which is basically the off switch for fight or flight. This works in like 30 seconds and im not exaggerating
* **the 5-4-3-2-1 grounding thing**: I know everyone says this but it actually works when youre in a full spiral. 5 things you see, 4 you hear, 3 you touch, 2 you smell, 1 you taste. It forces your brain out of the imaginary future and back into the actual present moment
* **cutting caffeine after noon**: I dont want to talk about how much of my anxiety was just... coffee. Embarrassing honestly lol
* **moving your body when the buzzing starts**: not like go to the gym. Just walk around the block. Do 20 jumping jacks. Anything. The adrenaline is in your body and it needs somewhere to go

**the 3am brain** 

If youre reading this at 3am with your brain running... hi. I see you. I was you...

The 3am spiral is different from daytime anxiety because theres nothing to distract you. Its just you and your thoughts and the ceiling and every mistake youve ever made playing on a loop

Things that actually helped:

* **the worry dump**: before bed write down every single thing your brain is worried about. All of it. Even the stupid stuff. Get it out of your head and onto paper. Your brain holds onto things because it thinks youll forget them. Show it you wont
* **the ""is this solvable right now"" test**: for each worry ask yourself can I do literally anything about this at 3am? If no then it goes on tomorrows list. If yes (it almost never is) then do it. This sounds basic but it gives your brain permission to let go
* **body scan relaxation**: start at your toes and consciously relax each muscle group moving up. Sounds dumb. Works. Your body holds anxiety physically and sometimes you dont realize how tense you are until you actually check
* **getting out of bed**: controversial but if youve been lying there for 30+ min just get up. Go to the couch. Do something boring. Lying in bed spiraling just trains your brain to associate your bed with anxiety

**Some random things that helped that dont fit neatly into a category:**

* **anxiety and hunger feel the same in your body**. I was having ""anxiety attacks"" that were literally just me forgetting to eat. Please eat something
* **your phone is making it worse**. Not in a boomer way but doom scrolling when youre already anxious is like pouring gasoline on a fire. I started leaving my phone in another room after 10pm and the 3am spirals got way less frequent
* **alcohol makes anxiety worse not better**. It feels like it helps in the moment but the next day your anxiety is 3x worse. Theres a name for it. Hangxiety. Its real and its awful
* **sometimes anxiety is just your body telling you something is actually wrong in your life**. Not everything needs to be managed. Sometimes the answer is changing the thing thats causing it. I was anxious about work for months before I realized I just... hated my job. That wasnt a disorder that was information

**where im at now**

Probably never will be fully non-anxious and thats ok. I still have bad days.  
  
But my baseline is so much lower than it was.

If youre reading this and youre in the thick of it... it gets better. I know that sounds like something people just say but im literally living proof. A year ago I was in the ER thinking I was dying and now im here writing this on my couch with my cat asleep on my legs feeling genuinely ok 💜

You guys deserve to feel ok too. Take what works from this and leave the rest. One thing at a time. Thats all it takes

This morning I was making coffee for my partner and me with my bambino plus. Mine turned out perfectly fine, but while steaming the milk for his, I noticed the steamer wasn’t working very well and saw that it was low on water. Very stupidly (*I know..*), I opened the reservoir and added water while it was in the middle of steaming.

 

I didn’t realize there were sensors tied to the water reservoir lid, and it stopped mid-steam and started flashing the steam lights (*the espresso lights stayed on, just the steaming lights were flashing*). I removed the pitcher, wiped everything down, and set the wand back down so it could purge, but it didn’t do anything.

 

I manually purged it by holding down the steam button, and that worked fine. I tried steaming again, and it started normally but stopped after about 5 seconds, and the lights began flashing again.

 

I thought maybe it was clogged, so I removed the pitcher again, cleaned the wand thoroughly, took off the tip and cleared the holes, and used the brush tool in the wand itself as well. I did another manual purge, which worked perfectly.

 

I even unplugged the machine, left it unplugged for about a minute, and plugged it back in.

 

A few minutes later, I tried steaming milk again, same issue. It starts steaming, stops after about 5 seconds, and the lights flash again.

 

At this point, I’m not sure what’s wrong. It’s clean, it purges fine, but it won’t stay steaming. Everything I’m finding online just says it needs cleaning, but I’ve already cleaned it thoroughly ☹

I know this, I am very bad at enforcing boundaries. But I really am trying! My social skills are just in the gutter because whenever I try to get out there and make friends, over and over again I end up befriending people who take advantage of me. Well, now I got my wish, and I have this friend who makes me feel like I’m unwillingly taking advantage of her! This friend also importantly happens to be my *coworker*. She is very sweet, but she has a way of ignoring my wishes in certain regards. 

I am not a gift giving person, in fact giving and receiving gifts makes me extremely uncomfortable because I always feel like I’m not grateful enough, or my gifts aren’t good enough, and it is always quite stressful. Well, this friend continues to give me gifts and I don’t know what to do about it. I am also not the wealthiest person, so I can’t always reciprocate, and when I do reciprocate it feels like it becomes even worse like she’s competing to give me gifts! It should be a very sweet thing, but I don’t know how to come out and tell her that I don’t want anything from now on. For example, there was a time that she asked me if I wanted a coffee from a cafe she was going to an I said yes, and when I went to pay her back, she refused to take payment. Then, the next time she asked if I wanted coffee, I said yes, and mentioned I’d be paying for both of us, but again she wouldn’t take my money. This makes me so uncomfortable because it feels like I’m taking advantage of her. So whenever she asks now I just say no, I don’t want anything, because I don’t want to feel indebted to her. 

The main thing that makes me uncomfortable though, is on multiple occasions she will bring books to work for me to borrow. These are books that I never ASKED to borrow. And it makes me really uncomfortable because now I have the stress of needing to read this book so I can return it to her. And sometimes when I return the book, she’ll tell me “oh I’ll bring the next book in the series tomorrow!” And I have to come up with some excuse as to why she doesn’t need to do that. I’ve tried telling her before that my reading list is very long so I won’t have time to read the book, or that I am not very into reading said genre, but she won’t budge! Today she did the same and brought a book for me to borrow at work, and basically said “I know you said you have a long reading list, but I lend things out to people for months sometimes so it’s no biggie, take your time!” It has just become so draining.

It’s not always easy to put labels on a face-to-face encounter with a humanoid entity. One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have long reported a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! It is more common than you might think. This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, punished by his parents and told to stay inside the cottage, he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. He held a short cane and was using it to tap on the window. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man. The man avoided Ron’s touch, stepped back then turned around and ran into the forest.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when a short, little elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. He seemingly walked through the wall into the room. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real. And then came the time that Galen had to move away. He begged his elf friend to follow him.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents, which shocked his parents. He didn’t want presents; he wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. As the witness watched, the creature suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush. The witness ran to see where the little man was, but he was gone.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pinkish skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard with her dog, to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she (and her dog) noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car. Hartmut had two passengers in the car with him, but only one of them could see the elf. The other saw nothing.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge everything we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves. And maybe some of these stories throughout history were actually ETs! Sometimes things are not always what they seem!

The combo of my usual extra strong chai with a shot of super fatty dairy? Almost instant migraine relief. 
 
I made a post about a month ago asking what folks are eating during attacks and a lot of people (myself included) said that ice cream helped. Fatty foods in general seemed to be high up on the list of foods that helped folks during or recovering from an attack. So, if you consume dairy and are someone that turns to ice cream for your migraines, adding some heavy cream to your coffee or tea may help you too. I hope this helps someone else!

​What makes him so special is the balance between his strict discipline as an FBI agent and his pure soul. One minute he's doing his morning yoga and vertical sit-ups, and the next he's genuinely befriending every single person in town from Sheriff Truman to the staff at the Double R. He treats everyone with the same level of respect and curiosity.

​What strikes me most is his appreciation for the little things like his coffee addiction, a slice of cherry pie, or the scent of Douglas Firs. It’s almost therapeutic to witness. Even when the abyss eventually stares back at him, his core which is that eccentric, kind-hearted, and optimistic spirit is what keeps us anchored to the story. We don't just root for him; we find comfort in him.

I already feel like a mental facility patient at large just as I'm typing this... a bathroom-concerning morning routine question, here goes!

How does one naturally say that they ""go to do their morning self care routine""? In the sense that a person goes to the bathroom to wash their face and brush their teeth and possibly but not necessarily take a shower.

As in, ""I wake up, turn my coffee machine on and go ""???"" (go to wash? go wash up? go get washed?)""

What are all of the most commonly used phrases used to describe that someone goes to the bathroom to wash their face, freshen up, stare at themselves in the mirror for no apparent reason contemplating what they are doing with their life... got carried away sorry.

I go to wash? I go freshen up?

My aunt, bless her heart, runs this tiny, adorable bakery called 'Sweet Nothings' in a little corner of town. For years, it was just her, a couple of loyal regulars, and the smell of freshly baked bread that mostly just teased passersby without bringing them in. She was pouring her heart and soul, and all her savings, into it, but it was barely treading water.

I’d been trying to convince her for ages to try some digital marketing, but she’s old school – thought 'the internet' was just for cat videos. Finally, after a particularly slow month where she was almost in tears, she let me have a crack at it. I started super simple: an Instagram page. No fancy gear, just my phone, good lighting, and her absolutely divine blueberry muffins. I focused on telling *her* story, showing the behind-the-scenes magic – her hands covered in flour, the steam rising from a fresh sourdough loaf, the sheer joy on her face when a new batch of cookies came out golden brown.

The first few weeks were crickets. I felt that familiar pit of doubt. Was this just a waste of time? But then, one Tuesday, I posted a slow-motion video of her drizzling glaze over a lemon loaf, with some chill indie music. It wasn't anything groundbreaking, but something about it just *clicked*. People started sharing, commenting, asking where the bakery was! The next day, there was a line out the door, all thanks to that video. People were calling it 'the most aesthetically pleasing bakery content' they'd ever seen.

Suddenly, Sweet Nothings was booming. We had to hire extra hands, and the once-quiet little shop was bustling with laughter and the clinking of coffee cups. It wasn't just about the muffins anymore; it was the story, the authenticity, the feeling we created online. It transformed from a struggling dream into a vibrant community hub. It still gives me goosebumps thinking about how a few well-placed phone pics and a dash of consistent effort turned everything around.

It makes you wonder, doesn't it? What's the smallest digital marketing effort you've seen make the biggest impact? Or what's your biggest 'aha!' moment in digital marketing?",1,1770915594.0,u_Leather-Buddy-7902,0,1.0,False

They way I view people is like a once in a life time opportunity and I really value connecting and making strong relationships. I can always get a new job, I can always go to school another time but people help me be in the moment and cherish things. 

Maybe I’ve just surrounded myself with the wrong group of people but I’m starting to realize now that I’m 24, people only hang out with me to get what they need done it’s never to actually connect. Or it’s like some grand event that we are there for the act but not really there for each other. 

Like the other day my friend invited to me to a store that sells home goods. And I was like ya a coffee, shop and yap. But her agenda was to get new bedding and just didn’t want to alone. I still feel flattered she wanted my opinion on her bedding. But a few days after I offered to go for a walk and grab a coffee and she just completely ignored my message. (This is a silly example but it’s a pattern) 

And yes maybe I’m seeing this from the wrong angle but the difference between my friends and I. Is that I’ll make time out of my schedule for my friends but most of my friends just want to fit me in there schedule. 

I think it’s a hard realization for me and it makes me want to put in less effort and more effort for myself.

1r2yr3p,https://i.redd.it/t34id6zrg3jg1.jpeg,"My nephew (he’s 4) asked for a pumpkin cake, so I pulled through","It’s very important to add that he’s 4 years old and what prompted him to ask was that I was giving him a bath in our sink (don’t worry, I thoroughly washed it afterwards) and he was using thins delicious smelling pumpkin dulce soap. We have some bananas going off so I asked him what he wants me to make with them and he said, “hmmmm🤔…PUMPKIN CAKE!!”. So I surprised him with it. 

It’s a pumpkin cake with cinnamon brown sugar streusel, cinnamon glaze, and pumpkin caramel sauce. It’s delicious and is very coffee cake-ish.

Here’s the recipe for inquiring minds:

Preheat the oven to 350° and (optional) line a 9x13 cake pan with parchment paper.

For the streusel, mix these ingredients and set aside:

•1/4 cup salted butter, melted

•1/2 cup brown sugar

•1/3 cup flour

•1/2 tsp salt

•1 tsp cinnamon

For the cake, cream together:

•10 tbsp salted butter, softened

•1 cup sugar

•1/2 cup brown sugar

Then, mix in until smooth and pale in color:

•1 tsp vanilla extract

•2 eggs

Then mix in until just combined (it will circle, don’t worry about it):

•1/2 cup milk OR buttermilk

•1 cup pumpkin purée (save the rest, it’ll be used)

Then, mix in until just combined (careful not to over mix):

•2 1/4 cup all purpose flour

•1 tbsp pumpkin pie spice OR cinnamon (your preference)

•1 1/2 tsp baking POWDER

•1/4 tsp baking SODA

•1 tsp salt

Evenly pour into the lined baking sheet, it will be thick, and generously top with the streusel mixture. 

Bake for 30-40 minutes OR until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted in the middle. Allow to cool completely or until just warm.

For the pumpkin caramel sauce, add to a microwave safe bowl:

•1/3 cup brown sugar

•2 tbsp pumpkin purée 

•1 tbsp salted butter

•1 tbsp heavy cream

•1/2 tsp salt

•1/2 tsp cinnamon

\*DO NOT TOUCH THE MIXTURE AFTER IT’S MICROWAVED IT WILL BURN THE SHIT OUT OF YOU\*

Microwave in 30 second increments, stirring in between each one, it will eventually thicken. I did it 4-5 times. It will bubble but just stir it really good and it’ll come out fine. place in the fridge to chill while you’re making your cinnamon glaze, this will also thicken it some.

For the cinnamon glaze, mix together and drizzle on top of the cake:

•1 cup powdered sugar

•1/2 tsp vanilla extract

•2 tbsp heavy cream

•1/2 tsp cinnamon 

•1/4 tsp salt

Then, remove the pumpkin caramel from the fridge and drizzle it over top of the cake as well. Hope y’all enjoy!",32,1770915426.0,Baking,3,0.94,False
