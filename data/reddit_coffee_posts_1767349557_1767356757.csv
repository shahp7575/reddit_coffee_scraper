# Weather & Weekend Outlook:

New Year's Day is behind us and we might catch some sunshine today, but don't get too comfortable. Temps are sliding into the single digits by evening with wind chills dipping below zero overnight. Saturday and Sunday stay brisk with highs stuck in the mid teens and lows bouncing around zero. A few lake effect flurries could drift in, but we should stay mostly dry. Early next week brings a chance for more widespread snow before a warmup pushes highs back toward the 30s by midweek.



# SOME of what's in this week's news:

* New ""American Abenaki"" curriculum draws sharp rebuke from Quebec based First Nations who call it a ""rewriting of history,"" with Rep. Headrick prepping legislation that would require their endorsement before it's used in schools
* City Councilor Becca Brown McKnight joined WVMT's Morning Drive this week and the conversation got real. Burlington is staring down a $12 million budget gap, and the proposed public safety tax only covers about a third of it.
* Vermont lands $195 million in federal rural health care funding, nearly double what the state expected, making it one of the highest per capita awards nationally
* South Burlington hires Joe Clark as permanent superintendent with a four year, $200K contract after he met with nearly 300 community members through his ""3Q meetings""
* The 30% federal solar tax credit officially expired this week, and local installers say they were fully booked by August as homeowners raced to beat the deadline
* State return to office mandate sees no mass exodus despite union warnings, with resignations actually down 10% compared to last year
* Burlington mental health provider Revolution Youth settles Medicaid fraud claims for $200K after admitting to backdated records and fabricated billing

Anyone else feel like crypto is oddly… calm?

No crazy hype.  
No nonstop moon tweets.  
No “this will replace everything by next year” energy.

But after reading today’s crypto news, I don’t think that’s a bad sign.

It feels like crypto is growing up.

A few things I noticed 

**Regulation isn’t the villain anymore.**  
Yeah, rules are annoying. Always have been.  
But what’s happening now feels different. Stablecoins are being forced to actually prove they’re stable. Shady stuff is getting filtered out. The serious players are still standing.

**Institutions didn’t rage quit. They just went quiet.**  
Banks and funds aren’t yelling on Twitter.  
They’re building in the background tokenized funds, custody, onchain settlement, even using Bitcoin as collateral instead of trying to buy coffee with it.

That kind of adoption is boring… until it isn’t.

**DeFi isn’t dead. It’s just less loud.**  
The wild yield farms are fading, but what’s replacing them feels more real:  
KYC pools. Real world assets. Stuff that can actually plug into the financial system without blowing up.

Not exciting screenshots. Just foundations.

**The tech conversation changed.**  
It’s not “which chain is fastest” anymore.  
It’s “does this work reliably, cheaply, and at scale?”

Layer 2s. Interoperability. Boring problems that actually matter.

**Security is finally taken seriously.**  
Audits, monitoring, certifications used to be “nice to have.”

I’m not looking for anything super high-end — just a stylish, comfortable, and durable set that’s great for relaxing, entertaining, or enjoying my morning coffee outside.

I’ve seen some really cute and affordable options, but I’m curious about the quality, comfort, and how well they hold up over time (especially in different weather conditions).

Ideally, I’m looking for a set that’s:

* Comfortable with supportive cushions
* Weather-resistant and low-maintenance
* Easy to assemble and move around
* Stylish enough to elevate a patio or deck
* Affordable without feeling flimsy

Here are a few sets I’ve been considering:

* **Better Homes & Gardens Clayton Court 4-Piece Patio Conversation Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Brookbury 5-Piece Outdoor Dining Set**
* **BH&G Ravenbrooke Wicker Sectional Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Camrose Farmhouse Outdoor Bench**
* **BH&G Hawthorne Park Bistro Set**
* **Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage Steel Conversation Set**
* **BH&G Ventura Stationary Rocking Chairs Set**

If you’ve purchased any of these or have experience with **Better Homes & Gardens patio furniture** in general, I’d love to know how it’s held up for you — especially over time or in rain/sun-heavy areas. Also open to tips on cushions, storage, and whether it's worth buying the furniture covers or extra accessories.

Thanks in advance!

Have you upset anybody lately simply because you believe the Bible is the final authority from God Himself?

Not long ago a middle-aged couple visited The Shepherd’s Church, where I have pastored now for many years. That Sunday they noticed the words on the face of my pulpit that read, “*Sola Scriptura*,” which means “Scripture alone.” In other words, the Bible is the final authority for life.

Well, they made an appointment to see me. He had been the teacher of his Sunday school class for thirty-five years. When we met in my office, he began by telling me how troubled he was—how shocked he was—when he saw those words on my pulpit: *Sola Scriptura*. I asked him, “What was so shocking about it?” He said, “Well, I didn’t think anybody believed that anymore.” He went on to tell me I was taking the Bible way too seriously—that Jesus was nothing more than a good rabbi, certainly not the Son of God.

This is the kind of reaction to the word of God the prophet Jeremiah is receiving from the nation of Judah. They think Jeremiah is taking God’s word far too seriously, and they want nothing to do with his prophecies.

Although the events recorded in chapters 34 through 36 of Jeremiah all took place before the fall of Jerusalem, these chapters are not arranged chronologically. They are placed here together to emphasize the theme running through these chapters—namely, the people’s *reaction to the word of God*.

Here in chapter 34, Judah’s last king, Zedekiah, is on the throne. The Babylonian army is conquering one city after another. Verse 7 tells us that only the cities of Lachish, Azekah, and Jerusalem remain free, but they will all fall soon enough.

Jeremiah’s message to King Zedekiah is not a happy one. Zedekiah is not going to put a verse from Jeremiah on his coffee mug to make him feel good in the morning. The Lord’s message to him is given in verses 2-3:

*“Behold, I am giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he shall burn it with* [*fire.You*](http://fire.You) *shall not escape from his hand but shall surely be captured.”*

You certainly do not want to read that over coffee in the morning! So, what Zedekiah does here is attempt to *twist the message of God’s word*.

We read in verses 8-9:

*King Zedekiah . . . made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem to make a proclamation of liberty to them,that everyone should set free his Hebrew slaves.*

What does that mean? Well, the Old Testament outlawed the abduction of people to sell as slaves to someone else (Exodus 21:16). But the law did permit what we would call indentured servanthood, where someone could sell himself to another in order to pay off his debts. However, the law of Moses demanded that this service must come to an end every seventh year (see Exodus 21:1-2; Deuteronomy 15:12-15). That way, Israelites would not become enslaved to one another. However, they have ignored this requirement, and Zedekiah now is trying to straighten it all out.

The problem is that Zedekiah is ignoring the real issue and trying to manipulate God into granting him favor. He is also pretty clever because he wants all these freed slaves to help him defend the city.

Now we are told later (see chapter 37) that the Babylonians suddenly leave Jerusalem to confront an Egyptian threat. Jerusalem is given temporary relief here. But what do they do? Verse 11 tells us:

*They turned around and took back the male and female slaves they had set free, and brought them into subjection.* 

They decide they do not need God’s help after all, so they return to violating the law of God.

Well, Jeremiah delivers the news to them that the Babylonians are going to return and take the city and burn it to the ground. He adds that everybody who broke this covenant with God and re-enslaved Israelites will face special judgment. Jeremiah states here in verse 20, “Their dead bodies shall be food for the birds . . . and the beasts.” They are not going to put that one on their coffee mug either.

It’s one thing to talk about *them*, but we too can fall into the rap of trying to manipulate God—trying to bribe Him with our actions and promises when we need His deliverance. That reminds me of the two fellows who had been shipwrecked. They are floating out there in the ocean on a piece of wood, and one of them begins to pray, “Lord, if You deliver me, I will stop stealing from my company, I will stop cheating on my taxes, I will never miss a church service again, I will—” and his friend hollers out, “Hold on! I think I see land.”

These people in Jerusalem are not serious with God. They just want God to bail them out.

In Jeremiah 35, we see another reaction. Here they simply *ignore God’s word*. The scene shifts back a dozen years to the reign of King Jehoiakim.

A clan known as the Rechabites move into Jerusalem seeking safety. The Lord tells Jeremiah to go out to these people and offer them wine to drink. He does so, but the Rechabites refuse his offer. They explain to Jeremiah here in verses 6-7:

“*We will drink no wine, for Jonadab the son of Rechab, our father, commanded us, ‘You shall not drink wine . . . you shall not build a house . . . but you shall live in tents all your days.’”*

In obedience to the command of their patriarch, Jonadab, they are committed to living as nomads and abstaining from anything fermented. Now understand that Jonadab lived some 200 years earlier (see 2 Kings 10:15).

The Rechabites’ rejection of Jeremiah’s offer was intended by God as a stunning rebuke to the nation of Judah. The Rechabites had been faithful to the command of an ancestor for over 200 years, but Judah continually ignored the commands of God.

Now in chapter 36 we find another reaction to God’s word. King Jehoiakim is going to try to *destroy the word of God*. The Lord tells Jeremiah here in verse 4 to dictate prophecies to his friend Baruch. Baruch writes them all down on a scroll and then reads them aloud in the temple.

Royal officials hear Baruch, and in verse 16 we are told, “They turned one to another in fear.” They want the king to hear Jeremiah’s words, but they wisely tell Baruch—and Jeremiah—to go hide while they read this scroll to the king. Verses 22-23 tell us what happens next:

*The king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the fire pot before him. As Jehudi \[an official\] read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife and throw them into the fire . . . until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire.* 

So, God instructs Jeremiah to dictate another scroll, but this time a prophecy of judgment against the king is included: he will have no descendants establishing a dynasty on the throne, and his own body will not even be buried after he dies.

Beloved, it’s a sad day—a dangerous day—when people ignore God’s Word or, as we see today, twist God’s Word around and upside down to make it say that something evil is good or that something good is evil. Of course, some simply wish the Bible did not exist at all, and some even try to destroy it.

I am reminded of Voltaire, the French philosopher from the 1700s who hated Christianity. On one occasion he predicted the Bible would fade into oblivion within 100 years of his death. It was not long after Voltaire died that the Geneva Bible Society purchased his home and turned it into a print shop to produce Bibles. Listen, God’s Word is established. In fact, God will have the last word.

**BLURB:**

We must beware of the sometimes-subtle temptations to disregard what God says and demands. God’s Word is truth. Our responsibility is not to make it conform to our desires but to bring our lives into conformity to it. This is the message for us in Jeremiah 34–36.",1,1767355295.0,TheWisdomJourney,0,1.0,False
1q1wud9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1wud9,DAK Milky Cake+V60 vs Chemex (w/ V60 filter),"Following on from my latest post here: https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/s/56z1a8ghyW

I decided to get a V60 and a suitable grinder. Multiple people suggested me to get a 1zpresso Q Air for the DAK brews since my ZP6 would produce “way to cleaner coffee”. 

Then, I ran an experiment. I wanted to check how the shape of the v60 and the Chemex affect the flavour by keeping as many variables the same. 

My setup

Coffee: DAK Milky cake and DAK Strawberry kiss 

Grinder: 1zpresso Q air. 50 clicks from the zero (which actually wasn’t zero but I don’t have an Allen key to flip the burrs) 

V60: brand new plastic V60

Chemex: my old companion. Here keep in mind that I’m using the V60 paper to keep all the variables the same. I’ve just added a chopstick through the gap to avoid that the paper would stick to it. See pictures. 

Dose: 15 grams for each brewer on 250 grams of water. Ratio: 0.06. 50 clicks in the grinder 

Water temperature: 96 Celsius 

Brewing: blooming for 45 seconds (60 grams of water), followed by 90 grams, followed by 100 grams. 

Timing results:

DAK Milky Cake: 

Chemex 3:40 mins

V60 4:40 mins

DAK Strawberry Kiss:

Chemex 4 mins

V60 5 mins 

Tasting:

We were 4 people, all pour over enthusiasts, and we let the coffee cool down for 5 mins and then we blindly tested them. We repeated the same after 20 mins when the coffee was actually cold. 

Results:

We all agreed that the basic flavours were there on both brewers but the coffee brewed with the Chemex was clearly more waterish. In other words the V60 produced coffee with more body despite all the variables, including the paper were the same. 

Personal note: still I don’t understand the hype for DAK. Unless there’s something terribly wrong with what I’m doing, it’s not a coffee I would buy from abroad (I live in Italy) since there are local roasters who can offer similar types of coffee. 

Any suggestion or further experiments I can run?

After 60 days, I stopped saying ""I'm trying to be more reflective"" and started saying ""I'm a writer."" The evidence was undeniable: 180+ entries proved it wasn't aspirational anymore.
2. Walking regardless of conditions Rain, snow, or exhaustion. 20 minutes minimum. Transformed me from someone who ""should exercise more"" to someone who ""prioritizes movement daily."" The day I walked in a thunderstorm was when I realized the identity shift had happened.
3. The immediate bed-making ritual Sounds trivial, but this 30-second habit became my anchor. It wasn't about tidiness. It was casting a vote for ""I'm someone who completes what they start"" before the day even begins. Small domino, massive effect.
4. Public acknowledgment of mistakes Started saying ""I was wrong"" immediately when I realized it. Terrifying at first, but this vote against ego and for growth transformed how others saw me and, more importantly, how I saw myself. Not someone who needs to be right, but someone committed to truth.
5. One daily act of unnecessary generosity Leaving bigger tips. Sending texts of appreciation. Buying coffee for strangers. Each small action was a vote for ""I'm abundant, not scarce."" After months, scarcity thinking vanished without any conscious effort.

Your actions are votes for your identity. Make enough small, consistent votes, and the change happens almost automatically. Your brain simply updates to match the evidence.

What small, daily ""votes"" have changed how you see yourself?",3,1767355193.0,TheImprovementRoom,0,1.0,False

1q1wtv6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1q1wtv6/am_i_being_too_picky/,Am I being too picky?,"I’m really not sure if I’m being overly sensitive here but I’m considering cancelling a date because of the restaurant this guy picked. 

So basically we matched in the apps and hit it off chatting. He asked for a phone call one night. I told him I don’t like to give out my number to people I’ve never met before but offered to call on an app. He said he didn’t have social media. Fine. I thought this would give him an opening to ask to meet up but then he just moves on saying how is your day today. Okay weird but whatever. I say let’s meet up for coffee date or something. He just says he doesn’t like coffee but doesn’t offer another suggestion. I say okay I don’t drink coffee either, I get tea or juice, just thought it would be something easy and chill. I then say I’m open to suggestions if you don’t like coffee. He says rob a bank. Clearly a joke but im like, okay, if you don’t wanna meet let’s just end it here. He suddenly back tracks saying it was a joke and that he’s interested in meeting. 

I’m like okay, it was a misunderstanding but I’m frustrated cause I’m like, actively trying to move this to in person for a date and it doesn’t seem like you’re interested at all. He assures me he’s interested. Asks when I’m available. I give general times in available. He asks what food I like and if I have any dietary restrictions. I answer but he doesn’t continue to plan. Just regular conversation. I don’t respond right away, a) cause I got busy at work and b) i was a little annoyed that he didn’t make a plan and just moved the conversation on. 

So after I don’t reply for several hours, he then suggests Friday. I say that works for me. Again, he doesn’t offer a time or a place, he just moves the conversation again. Finally last night I have to ask, what time and place he’s thinking to meet. He suggests this pub. Now that’s all fine and dandy. EXCEPT, due to my food allergies, the only thing on the menu I can eat is fucking salad. (Gluten allergy, everything at this pub is burgers or sandwiches and they don’t offer gluten free bread.) 

Now, normally I try to be flexible with my food, because I know my allergy can be restrictive. I usually don’t tell people about it and just check the menu before hand and I’m happy with whatever. But because he specifically asked about my dietary restrictions and then seemingly ignored it or just picked a random spot, I’m debating just cancelling. Because to me it feels like he didn’t put much effort into picking the spot. And it’s just like, if he can’t even pick a spot that has options for me for the first date, would he even put any effort into dates down the line? I’m not sure if I’m being overly sensitive or if I should just trust my gut and cancel. Looking for some outside opinions. 

TLDR: tried to plan a date with a guy from an app. Has difficulties trying to plan it. He asked about my dietary restrictions. He seemingly ignored that and picked a spot with limited options for me. Wondering now if I should just cancel",0,1767355150.0,dating_advice,8,0.5,False

1q1woym,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskLawyers/comments/1q1woym/roommate_nightmare/,Roommate Nightmare,"I needed a roommate so I found a lady who wanted to move in. I have a nice condo in Nashville in a quiet gated community. She moved in on the day I interviewed her. After moving in I notice bizarre behavior. For the record we are both in our early 50’s. I have had the same career for 30+ years with a stable job and clean record. 
I ask her why she is needed to move so quickly and says her other roommate she lived with FOR 2 WEEKS put “something” in her shampoo to make her hair fall out. Told me she had to move because she was in cocaine. I asked her how she knew she was on cocaine because she actually never saw her do coke and she said “I can just tell” 
I take that with a grain of salt. 2 sides to every story right? 
After she moves in I learn that she doesn’t have a car. She tells me she works for Uber and rents a car from them. I am getting SUPER uncomfortable on the 3rd day. Mind you all Ind is work and come home. I get up around 4 am to get ready for work and do not get home until around 5 pm. 
I have Fridays off. The first Friday I have off- she asked me why I was not  at work? Like it’s really none of her concern. She acts shocked and surprised when I tell her I have Fridays off. 
Let me back up- the next day after moving in she installed a ring camera at my front door then never gave me access to it. I live in a gated condo complex with only 8 brick buildings. It’s super safe here. I told her the camera was not necessary. She THEN puts up another camera in my living room. By this point I’m getting nervous. I know something bad is going to happen. I figure she is a paranoid schizophrenic. I tell her to take the camera down in the living room. No need for that. She becomes so angry and starts blowing my phone up at work sending threatening texts (paragraphs) I do not have time to read at work. I see 40+ patients a day and do not have time for this bs behavior. She threatens
 to call the cops on me because I took the front door ring cam down 
Only thing I text back was please do. 
I see her in the kitchen one morning and she asks me why some of my coffee pods are missing because apparently she has been counting them??? She said did you have people over last night? This was before I took the ring cam down. I said no why?! She said some of your coffee pods are missing. BECAUSE I TAKE THEM TO WORK. At this point I can’t take it anymore. I ask her to move out. She does not. She hides from me in her room with the door closed at all hours of the day. I don’t even know if she works because this chick is crazy town. I want to talk to her in person but she won’t come out of her room. Continues to blow my phone up with texts messages that I DO not respond to other than asking when she is going to leave. She starts slowly moving boxes out. She has been here not even 2 weeks. I thought when she was moving the boxes out she would be gone that day but she didn’t leave! She even asked my neighbor to help her carry her boxes! I never bother my neighbors for ANYTHING. I am so embarrassed at this point. 
I am so tired by now and do not feel safe with her staying another night here. I put the rest of her stuff out and called a locksmith to come charge the locks. It was $150. I get in bed because I have to get up at 4 am to go to work. I hear someone pounding on my door and it’s her with the police! I did. It let her come in but I told the cop everything that had been going on and that I fear for my safety because this lady is a special kind of crazy. They let her get some clothes she had left in the dryer. She proceeds to film me speaking with the police even though they have body cams on. Ok FINALLY I’m getting in bed and trying to sleep. They knock on the door AGAIN. “She said she needs to get one more thing” IM SO PISSED OFF BY NOW. 
The next day I get a call from a different police officer that tells me she tried putting a restraining order ON ME but it got denied. I cannot even believe this shit is happening to me right now. If anyone needs a restraining order it’s for her FROM me. The cop tells me I should get one on her because it will look better for me In court. In COURT?!? I ask?? On what grounds am I being taken to court?!? He said he would tell me who he came to serve me. Ok great now I can’t sleep because of all this and my stomach is so upset I’m pissing out my ass. Sorry but this actually happened. The next day (New Year’s Eve) the officer calls while I’m in the shower so I couldn’t take the call. I call him back and leave a VM. Waited a couple of hours and try to call him back. No answer. I’m freaking out not knowing what I should do over this minuscule bs behavior. The next day (New Years Day) I decide to go get a restraining order in her. The police station is closed. Now I feel like I need a lawyer. The police called me yesterday and asked what a good time was for them to serve me papers. This is the craziest thing I have ever had to deal with with someone!!! So the police are supposed to come to my house today anywhere from 10-1:00. This is ruining my whole time off of work. 
Now I have to do all this research on this crazy lady so I looked up her background check I had her do before moving in and there are several addresses listed. One of them is Luke Bryan’s house that I can guarantee she did. It live at. How does someone put fake addresses on a background check?!? I have been up since 2 am. I can’t let this STRANGER destroy who I am!!! My dad said she probably does this for a living and she has been trying to set me up this whole time. Who has time to do this?!? I’m all out of ideas on knowing what to do. ",0,1767354686.0,AskLawyers,2,0.5,False
1q1woha,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q1woha,Mein Kaffee-Wrapped-2025,"Moin beisammen,  
2025 war mein erstes volles Jahr als Kaffee-Snob. Daher dachte ich, dass ich mal meine Böhnchen/Kaffeereise mit euch teile.

Ich trinke am liebsten Filterkaffee (V60), aber bin wegen meiner Frau auch recht fleißig dabei Cappuccino zu trinken. Die Siebträgermaschine (Lelit Bianca V3) kam 09.'24 ins Haus und das erste Jahr haben ~~wir~~ ich dann fleißig von Hand gemahlen (Timemore C3ESP Pro), bis ich mich endlich für eine elektrische Mühle entscheiden konnte. Bin jetzt komplett zufrieden mit der WPM-ZP1.

Aber zu den Bohnen: Zuhause trinken ich meist von den gleichen Röstereien. Vorallem mein Lieblingsröster hat immer eine große Rotation an Bohnen, also trinke ich ständig was neues. Ist manchmal etwas ärgerlich, wenn man von den gleichen Bohnen Nachschlag mag und die ausverkauft sind, aber mit der Zeit arrangiert man sich und friert hat mehr ein wenn's mundet. Sonst nehme ich auch immer gerne etwas aus dem Urlaub mit.

Großer Fan bin ich von hellen Röstungen, die angenehm fruchtig sind. Der klassische italienische Espresso ist nicht so meins, dementsprechend bin ich auch eher in die Richtung Third-Wave Kaffee gegangen.  
Meine absolute Lieblingsbohne für Filter war [diese hier](https://halbstark-kaffee.de/en/products/rwanda-huye-mountain?srsltid=AfmBOorBYDfDOtkjmY2RWb5cZcTjTYYswrcSfrrZFy3gevrrYxsyI-dp). Ist jetzt leider ausverkauft, aber ich hoffe, dass die irgendwann wieder bei denen im Sortiment auftaucht. Sonst hatte ich eigentlich keine Bohnen, die besonders furchtbar gewesen sein. Nur die Hildesheimer Röstung (unten im Bild) war nicht so meins. Hätte man aber evtl. auch vor dem Kauf wissen können.

Teuerste Bohne war mit 175€/kg ein [Geisha](https://halbstark-kaffee.de/en/products/colombia-monteverde-geisha-blue?srsltid=AfmBOooWodZ8e0sxXWcMZzLEpg6HM_jXaY59U7QGUs1UfDiKaet5_BIm) und war geschmacklich auch echt gut!  
Aber irgendwie dann doch nicht 3x so gut, wie Bohnen die nur ein Drittel kosten... 

Bin offen für eure Empfehlungen oder eure Bohne des Jahres, oder auch euer Lieblingskaffees.

(Hätte gern auch mit Zahlen und Statistiken geglänzt... Vllt dann 2026, dachte aber, dass der Post doch ganz interessant sein kann.)

The Labor Condition Application (LCA) that employers file is the first step in obtaining H1B Visas for foreign workers. It is also used by fraudsters to game the system. 

Here Are Some State-By-State Reports:

**H1B Jobs By State:**  
[https://github.com/ITContractorsUnion/ITContractorsUnion/tree/Main/H1B\_Jobs\_By\_State](https://github.com/ITContractorsUnion/ITContractorsUnion/tree/Main/H1B_Jobs_By_State)

[https://github.com/ITContractorsUnion/ITContractorsUnion/tree/Main/State\_H1B\_Jobs](https://github.com/ITContractorsUnion/ITContractorsUnion/tree/Main/State_H1B_Jobs)

  
These files contain Names, Email Addresses, And Phone Numbers of internal company contacts for HR, Immigration, and in some cases actual Hiring Managers. They are updated quarterly by the US DOL.

You should be able to obtain the names of hiring managers from the contact info in the files. You can always try contacting those companies by mail, and reference the Case Number(s) of the jobs you are interested in. You may find an open position that way.

You might also be able to use these data to find fraud in the H1B immigration system. If you do that, you may be able to get a job with US Tech Force. They are looking for such people now.

Finally ICE does pay for evidence:

So you may be able to make a career for yourself as an independent forensic data examiner.

Remember, these are jobs that employers say they can't find American Workers for, so try finding them instead.

Director Pratensis blinked and furrowed her brow. “Why does everyone keep saying what?”

“That Icarus doesn’t exist.” Alia said. “Every time I ask about Icarus, they tell me that Icarus doesn’t exist.”

“It doesn’t though,” The director said. “Not really. If it did then the non-aligned worlds would know about them. As it stands, we believe that Icarus is merely a name given to the troubles Eternity is having, to shift the blame away from her.”

“Troubles?”

“Don’t feign ignorance Eternity, it does nobody favors.” The Director said and frowned. After a moment she looked at her and Viv, and then back to Alia. “Wait, you don’t actually know?”

Viv sighed. “We told you already, Eternity was recently in hibernation for three thousand years. She predates the creation of the Eternal Empire.

“Hmm.” Director Pratensis looked down at her pad. “You did just save us all and please know that I am more grateful than you can realize, but also, you’re *Eternity*. I can’t just go telling you all our intelligence on your empire.”

“Director,” Alia pleaded. “I just saved your entire station from the largest UM excursion in centuries. You yourself said I’m holy.”

“And you saved us by absorbing the UM, something we didn’t think we possible.” The director looked at Alia, and then diverted her gaze. “Frankly, you worry us. However, we are eternally-” The Director smiled at their own joke, “-grateful for the assistance. We will use our contacts with Soil to see about getting you a visa, but I am afraid that is as far as we are willing to go.”

Alia opened her mouth to protest, but Viv placed her hand on Alia’s shoulder. “Eternity, we should take what we can get at this point. We can do our own investigation into your empire.”

“Your attendant is wise, Eternity.” Director Pratensis said. “Once again, I am surprised at you. Our records indicate that Eternity would surround herself with sycophants.”

“I-” Alia stopped. “Thank you, Director. Viv has been invaluable to me.” She stood and the Director stood with her. “May my crew visit your station? They deserve some time off and we would like to purchase supplies.”

“*Purchase* supplies? I-” The Director shook her head once and smiled broadly. “Of course Eternity. You and your crew are welcome here while we negotiate with Soil. Our quartermaster will speak with yours about what you need.”

After they left her office, Viv turned to Alia as they were walking back to Tontine. “You are changing minds about Eternity everywhere you go.”

“It appears that way.” Alia agreed. “But why?”

“Because you’re not demanding fealty and supplies at the end of a gun.” Viv said. “Before I met you, that would be the way that we would all resupply if we were ever outside the Eternal Empire.” She thought a moment. “Often while inside as well. Strength begets strength after all.”

“Does it though?” Alia said. “It seems that being helpful is paying larger dividends.”

“That may be true Eternity.” Viv said, and didn’t elaborate.

Back aboard Tontine, Alia related the news to a cheer from the crew. Everyone was granted thirty six hours leave and a stipend from Eternity’s own coffers to handle meals and incidentals. People looked down at their pads in awe. She had given them a years pay all at once.

“Careful Alia.” Tontine said. “Most of them have never seen that much money at once. Some are going to go a bit wild.”

Alia grinned. “So long as nobody runs afoul of local laws or customs, I don’t mind. We’re injecting capital into Midori’s economy. In fact-” Alia nodded at Viv. “Let’s go see it for ourselves.”

“Alia, I shall continue to work on decrypting the message we received. May I engage Jade to assist?” Tontine said.

“Would Jade help you?”

“We won’t know unless I ask.” Tontine said simply.

“Okay,” Alia said carefully. “You may ask Jade if they’re willing to assist.”

Once they left the hangar it was it was more than sixteen minutes before someone recognized them, something that Alia kept in the back of her mind for later. With the way Director Pratensis treated her, Alia wondered how people separated Eternity the despot from Eternity their god. She might actually have an opportunity just be Alia. 

They were in line at a cafe to get something hot to drink when a young girl walked up to them. Alia was terrible at guessing the ages of children, but she was probably under 10. “Your uniforms are pretty.” The girl said said quietly.

“Thank you.” Alia replied. “I like the gold piping.”

“What’s piping?”

“The gold along the edges here.” Alia gestured to her uniform.

“Are you Eternity?”

Alia smiled. “I am, yes.”

All of the noise and conversation in the shop ceased. Every patron stared at them, eyes wide and mouth agape. The spell was broken when a small child turned to another sitting next to them and said “I *told you* she wasn’t ten meters tall and covered in holy fire.” There were chuckles in the cafe and conversation returned to normal. 

At the counter they ordered their drinks and as the two paper cups were brought out the server looked at them and said, “Did you really save us from a UM excursion?”

“I wouldn’t say *save*,” Alia said as she took the cup. “We assisted Jade and with everyone’s help, the excursion was contained.”

“That’s not what I heard,” a man sitting further down the counter said. “I heard that you walked up to the UM, something holy happened, and then it disappeared.”

“That’s not what happened you hayseed.” A voice from two tables over said. “Eternity commanded the UM to disintegrate and it did.”

“I heard that Eternity’s mystics are able to control the UM.”

“No, it wasn’t anything like that.” Alia said, making a face. It wasn’t even an hour since the incident and rumors were already running rampant. “We all worked together and contained the excursion in the normal way.”

“If you say so, Eternity.” The server said.

“We’re not in the Eternal Empire, you can call me Alia.” She said.

Cutlery clattered to the table and more gasps were audibly heard.

“No we can’t.” Someone wailed. “You’re *Eternity*.”

“But, we’re not in the Empire.” Alia said. “I have no jurisdiction over you.”

“That doesn’t mean you’re not Eternity.” A patron in the back said. “You may not have a direct say in our rule, but you still guide and protect us.”

“Er,” Alia began.

Sounds of agreement and nods throughout the cafe. Alia turned towards Viv desperately.

“Eternity, it seems that even though you do not rule out here, people still respect you and your work.” She said.

“My work?”

“Your work guiding and protecting the people.” Viv said low through gritted teeth. Over their personal comm she said, “They think you’re holy, and the more you deny it the more questions we’re going to get, and the more awkward it’s going to be.”

“But I’m not holy.” Alia said over the comm to Viv.

“We-They think you are.”

“Gods, the religion my sisters created lasted beyond the empire itself.” Aloud Alia said, “Thank you for the reminder. If you’re not comfortable calling me Alia, you may still address me as Eternity.”

She had to admit, the drink was good. She hadn’t even asked what it was, but it appeared to be some kind of sweet, hot fruit drink. Alia was enjoying it so much she didn’t notice the man approach them as they left the cafe. 

“Eternityyyy!” He shouted, his voice ragged from the effort.

Alia turned to see who had called her name, but by then he had brought out the submachine gun and started to fire. After the first gun report reached her ears, she had dove into Tartarus automatically.

Even while in Tartarus, the bullets traveled towards her faster than she would have liked, but she could still duck around them. The man was wild-eyed with a long coat and as it billowed behind him, Alia could see more weapons underneath.

She turned to make sure none of the rounds were going to hit anyone - he was firing indiscriminately towards them, and the last thing Alia wanted was a bystander hit. 

Striding towards him, she slammed the gun straight up. It pirouetted out of his hands firing two more times before stopping. Alia reared back and chopped him in the neck with the edge of her palm, trying to disable him. 

His head came off instead. 

The moment her hand started passing through his neck, Alia realized what she did. Using her full strength while moving this fast meant her hand might as well been a blade. Alia unclenched and as her perception went back to normal, the perpetrators head rocketed to the side, and the body remained where it was. The body stood there stupidly, blood welling out of the neck. Still staring at her work, Alia reached out and caught the submachine gun as it fell back down without looking at it.

Viv ran up to her, ignoring the gore next to Alia. “Eternity! Are you all right?”

“I’m fine Viv.” Alia said as she looked down at the submachine gun she was holding. She didn’t recognize the model, but it looked to be of a simple, durable make. She ejected the magazine and tossed it to the ground where it clattered next to the body. “Shit.” She said. “I didn’t mean to kill him, I just wanted to stop him before he hit any bystanders.” She looked up to Viv quickly. “Nobody else was hit, correct?”

“No Eternity, the shots all went wide, and everyone ducked down as soon as the shooting started.” Viv seemed to be trying to hide excitement in her voice.

“Why do you seem so excited, Viv?” Alia asked as station security ran up towards them.

“You’ve earned your first ink spot Eternity! You were challenged and defeated the challenger. This is an honor.” Viv was smiling broadly. “And you did it unarmed; there is no questioning who you are. See? Even the people of Jade recognize it!”

Alia turned and saw the crowd staring. More than a few of them immediately got down on one knee and a few made the circle gesture.

Security did a cursory examination of the body, found a few more weapons as well as two grenades. There was no handy piece of paper that said he was from Icarus, and when searched his quarters turned up a concerning number of weapons, but nothing else. He had no prior arrests, no history of illness, and worked a regular job in the greenhouse. Coworkers said that he seemed perfectly normal up until this morning after the news bulletin about the UM excursion that Eternity foiled. They said he put down his tools, and walked straight out of the greenhouse and back home. As near as Jade security could work out, he went home, picked up the weapons and then attacked Eternity. 

“But why?” Alia said after receiving the debrief from Jade’s chief of security, with Director Pratensis standing behind him.

“We don’t know, Eternity.”

“Did he have any kind of body modifications?”

“He had the same medical scanner and banking modifications we all have, but nothing out of the ordinary.”

“It doesn’t seem very plausible that someone who seemingly lived a quiet normal life here would walk away from their job, grab enough weapons to take on a squad of soldiers, and then attack Eternity, does it?”

He shrugged. “He’s dead now, so we can’t ask him, and there isn’t any evidence pointing to some kind of conspiracy. Maybe he held some kind of deep resentment for you, and when you showed up here, he took what he thought would be his only chance.”

Alia sighed and stood. They weren’t going to look too deeply into this attack. “Thank you for your time, Chief and thank you again Director Pratensis.”

This time both them them bowed slightly and said in unison, “Thank you, Eternity.”

Alia waited until they were back aboard Tontine before she said anything else. As soon as the airlock door slid shut, she said, “Tontine, I can’t be the only one who thinks this is weird, right?”

“Er,” Tontine said awkwardly - Tontine was being awkward! “Alia, given what I know about the religion your sisters created - *quite a lot* given that I am an Eternal Navy Light Frigate - their behavior is well within expected parameters.”

Viv nodded agreement. “Tontine is right, I didn’t see anything out of the ordinary.”

“They’re worshiping me!” Alia wailed. 

“You are Eternity. You protect and guide us. Nothing out did today would dissuade anyone who saw you that you weren’t anything less than what you say you are.”

“But I’m not saying it!”

“Eternity says it.” Tontine said. “Therefore, you say it.”

“Alia, come to my quarters please.” Viv said, her face thoughtful.

Viv’s quarters were her old ones when she was in command of Tontine, a nice two room suite near command. Alia had never been in her quarters before. It was neat and tidy and smelled floral. On the table in the antechamber was coffee cup, half full. After she closed the entrance shut Viv opened the door to her bedroom. “In here, Alia.”

Feeling nervous, but not sure why, Alia entered Viv’s bedroom. It was a relatively standard issue bedroom. It had a nice, clean laundry and a resinous smell she didn't recognize. The bed was midsized and unmade with a family photo on the nightstand, one of her drawers was half open a sock preventing it from closing, her closet held three other uniforms as well as a spare Eternity uniform, and along the wall over the bed was-

\-was a religious icon of *her*.

A meter wide and a meter and a half tall it depicted Alia - an idealized, smoothed over version of Alia - in the white pressure suit robe the mystics wore rising over scores of planets that were ablaze. Behind her starships that were massing on her right, and on her left were people bowing to her. On a small shelf below the icon, two electric votives were flickering gently with two small sticks of incense ashen between them.

Silently, Alia turned towards Viv, her eyebrows sky high.

“Er,” Viv coughed. “It was a gift from my parents. It’s an original Ogilvy, he hardly ever took commissions. The title is Eternity’s Watch.”

“Over your bed?”

“There aren’t any other walls large enough to hang it.” Viv protested. “Alia, you have to understand that for trillions of people in the universe - even some non-humans - you’re God.”

“But I’m-” Alia protested.

Viv shook her head. “Your sisters spent three thousand years telling everyone that Eternity is the holy one who guides and protects us.” Viv was clearly struggling with something. “Alia, I went to a parochial school. I received top marks in Eternal history.” She gestured towards the icon, “I’m… more religious than most.”

Realization dawned. Viv’s personality had seemingly flipped as soon as she met Alia because she had been paling around with God. “Oh Gods, Viv. You really believe that I’m holy? Me?”

She nodded and her smile was small. “I do, Alia. You haven’t done anything to tell me you’re not. You dive into danger the moment it happens. You help people, you guide them, and you eliminated a Universal Matter excursion - the most dangerous thing in the universe - on your own, easily. If that’s not holy, then I don’t know what is. I know what you’ve told all of us; aboard Tontine, you’re Alia. I know that, the crew knows that, Tontine knows that. But also to me, the crew and everyone else-” she gestured at the Icon, “-that’s you.”",4,1767354341.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

I'm looking forward with one partially working eye to visiting in a couple of weeks. On Tuesday the 13th I'm spending two days in Helsinki before moving on to Tallinn for Baltic Porter day. I've looked online using both Untappd and Google Gemini in order to find the best Craft Beer spots but I'd love to hear your recommendations as people who live in the city. Particularly those of you who know your way around the craft beer world. I travel the world for beer and end up meeting people from Untappd wherever I go so I have quite an extensive International beer focused friend group. I follow a few from Helsinki so I'll probably end up meeting them at some point but I wouldn't be against meeting others. 

On a similar note I got into specialty coffee a couple of years ago so I'm always on the lookout for some decent places who focus on single origin Coffee if possible. I imagine Helsinki as something of a hub for it given how much you adore coffee. 

On the exact opposite end of the spectrum I love pretty plain slabs of meat. I'm a fan of the Scottish breakfast over here and I love a good steak or sausages. I'd love to find places where I can indulge that side of me as well. Particularly interesting if you know somewhere that would sell me something like reindeer or Elk steak if that's something you do. 

I'll be staying in the Hilton Helsinki Strand so apparently that's quite close to a few good beer venues but I'd like to know more. Particularly if there are some great beer bars hidden away that have maybe 10 or 20 taps but the locals mainly go there. 

Lastly if you end up seeing an obviously visually impaired man with a long white cane in a beer bar and he has an obvious Scottish accent that's me. Feel free to come up and say hello, I'm always up for a chat.",2,1767353801.0,helsinki,6,0.75,False

You know the feeling, the slow erosion of energy that no amount of coffee quite fixes.

On a whim (and partly out of fatigue), I made a small change in class. Instead of launching into content, I asked students to take three minutes to write by hand, one thing from the last unit that still felt confusing *and* one thing they felt oddly confident about. No names. No grades. Just honesty.

The room went quiet in a way it rarely does anymore.

That stack of half-sheets is now sitting on my desk, and I’ve read them twice. There was confusion I expected, sure, but also clarity I didn’t realize I’d helped create. A few students articulated concepts more cleanly than I’ve ever explained them. Several mentioned that being told “it’s okay not to get this yet” mattered more than the explanation itself.

Later that evening, I got a short email from a student who almost never speaks in class. It wasn’t effusive or dramatic, just a few lines saying that writing instead of speaking made them feel like their understanding counted. I had to sit with that for a minute.

I don’t want to romanticize the work. Teaching is still exhausting, often thankless, and structurally undervalued. But moments like this remind me that *how* we teach can quietly change who feels included in the room and that those changes don’t always require a full course redesign or a new piece of ed-tech.

This past year wasn’t easy. I lost some people, drifted from others, made mistakes I still think about at night, and had days where just getting out of bed felt like a win. There were moments I genuinely didn’t know if things would get better. But here I am. Still standing. Still trying.

I’m grateful for the small things I used to overlook, warm coffee on cold mornings, random laughs with strangers, the one friend who checked in when I went quiet, the fact that I survived days I once thought would break me. I’m grateful for growth that came through pain, for lessons that hurt but shaped me, and for the quiet strength I didn’t know I had until I needed it.

If you’re reading this and you’re entering the New Year feeling behind, tired, or unsure, you’re not alone. You don’t need to have everything figured out.

everyone tells you to wake up at 5am, meditate for an hour, journal 3 pages. like cool but i can barely remember to drink water. the real question isn't what habits are good, it's why tf do 92% of people fail at keeping them (according to research from University of Scranton).



turns out we've been thinking about this completely wrong. it's not about discipline or willpower, it's literally about how your brain is wired. our brains are lazy efficiency machines that HATE change because change = potential danger in caveman times. so when you try to overhaul your entire life overnight, your brain goes into full rebellion mode.



but here's what actually works. and i mean actually backed by neuroscience and behavioral research, not instagram guru BS.



1. stack habits onto existing routines instead of creating new ones



this is called ""habit stacking"" and it's probably the most underrated technique ever. your brain already has neural pathways for things you do automatically. like brushing teeth, making coffee, getting in your car. 



the trick is attaching new behaviors to these existing pathways. after i pour my coffee, i take my vitamins. after i brush my teeth at night, i floss (revolutionary i know). after i sit in my car, i do 60 seconds of breathing exercises before driving.



BJ Fogg who literally runs Stanford's Behavior Design Lab wrote this book called Tiny Habits and it's insanely good. he breaks down the exact formula: after i DO EXISTING HABIT, i will DO NEW TINY HABIT. the book won multiple awards and Fogg has spent 20+ years researching behavior change. his whole thing is making habits so stupidly small that you can't fail. want to read more? don't commit to 30 pages. commit to ONE page after you get in bed. 



sounds too simple right? but that's exactly why it works. your brain doesn't freak out over one page.



2. use environmental design to make good choices automatic



your willpower is FINITE. like actually finite, not just a motivational speech thing. research from Florida State University shows willpower depletes throughout the day like a muscle getting tired.



so stop relying on it. instead redesign your environment so the good choice is the easy choice. i put my running shoes right by my bed so they're literally the first thing i see. i deleted all social media from my phone home screen and put Kindle there instead. 



there's this app called Ash that's basically like having a therapist in your pocket and it helped me identify all these unconscious patterns where my environment was sabotaging me. it uses AI to give you personalized mental health coaching and honestly the insights are WILD. it'll be like ""you always scroll instagram when you're avoiding difficult emotions"" and you're like wow okay called out.



the author of Atomic Habits James Clear talks about this concept of ""environment design"" extensively. make bad habits invisible, difficult, unsatisfying. make good habits obvious, easy, satisfying. 



put your phone in another room when working. use website blockers. put healthy snacks at eye level and junk food in hard to reach places. sounds basic but most people are white knuckling their way through life when they could just. move the cookies.



3. track something, literally anything, even if it feels pointless



okay this one felt so stupid to me initially but the data is overwhelming. people who track their habits are 2-3x more likely to stick with them according to a study in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine.



it's not even about the data itself. it's about creating a feedback loop that makes progress visible. your brain LOVES seeing progress, it releases dopamine which reinforces the behavior.



i use this habit tracking app called Finch where you have a little bird that grows as you complete habits and honestly having a virtual pet that depends on me doing my laundry is more motivating than it should be. it's weirdly wholesome and way less intense than those productivity apps that shame you.



the key is tracking the BEHAVIOR not the outcome. don't track ""lose 10 pounds"", track ""went to gym"" or even smaller ""put on gym clothes"". because you control the behavior but not always the outcome.



Jerry Seinfeld has this famous ""don't break the chain"" method where he marks an X on a calendar every day he writes jokes. after a few days you have a chain and your only job is to not break it. ridiculously simple but it works because humans hate breaking streaks.



4. make it so easy you'd feel stupid NOT doing it



this goes back to the Tiny Habits concept but it deserves its own section because people constantly overcomplicate things.



want to exercise more? don't commit to a 90 minute workout. commit to putting on workout clothes. that's it. most of the time once you're dressed you'll actually work out but even if you don't, you still succeeded at your tiny habit.



want to eat healthier? don't overhaul your entire diet. commit to adding ONE vegetable to whatever you're already eating. already eating pizza? cool put some spinach on it. 



BeFreed is an AI learning app that creates personalized audio podcasts from books, research papers, and expert interviews based on your specific goals. Built by Columbia alumni and former Google experts, it pulls from high quality, fact checked sources to generate content tailored to your learning style and depth preference. You can go from a quick 10 minute summary to a 40 minute deep dive with examples depending on your mood. The app also builds an adaptive learning plan that evolves with you, kind of like having a structured curriculum for whatever skill you're working on. Plus you get a virtual coach avatar you can chat with about struggles or questions mid podcast. The voice customization is surprisingly addictive, you can pick everything from a deep smoky tone to something more energetic. Makes commute time or gym sessions way more productive than just zoning out to music.



wanna meditate? the app Insight Timer has literally thousands of meditations including 1 minute ones. you can spare 60 seconds. they also have this huge community aspect which makes it feel less lonely when you're starting out.



the book The Power of Habit by Charles Duhigg (NY Times bestselling journalist who won a Pulitzer) explains that habits have three components: cue, routine, reward. most people focus on making the routine harder which is backwards. make the routine so easy that even on your worst day you can do it.



5. focus on identity change not outcome change



this is the most important one and most people completely miss it.



stop saying ""i want to run a marathon"" and start saying ""i am a runner"". stop saying ""i want to lose weight"" and start saying ""i am someone who takes care of their body"". 



sounds like semantics but it's actually how behavior change works at a neurological level. when something becomes part of your IDENTITY, you don't need discipline anymore. you just do it because it's who you are.



every action you take is a vote for the type of person you want to become. went to the gym once? that's one vote for ""i am athletic"". read for 5 minutes? vote for ""i am a reader"". 



James Clear talks about this identity based habits concept and it completely reframed how i think about change. outcomes are about what you get, identity is about what you become. and what you become is infinitely more important.



the crazy thing about all of this is that none of it requires you to be more disciplined or motivated or have your life together. it's just working WITH your brain instead of against it.



society has sold us this narrative that change requires suffering and massive effort but that's actually counterproductive. sustainable change is supposed to feel easy, almost boring. 



start with ONE habit. make it stupidly small. attach it to something you already do. track it. let it become part of who you are.



then add another.

Stopping at small towns instead of just tourist spots made mornings less hectic. Making my own meals and having coffee while parked near a waterfall turned the trip from stressful to relaxing.

So I’ve been keto for about the better part of three years. Lost a ton of weight. Although, now I have crept back into the 190s.  (235 to 175 was my biggest drop) although a lot of that definitely is muscle. I’m kind of a Jim rat. I’ve considered going full on carnivore, but honestly, the one thing that has kept me back is the “no energy drinks“ rule. Black coffee only they say… Is that really a thing? is it just the ideology of reading absolutely everything that is a natural? Or is the thought that sugar-free energy drinks will also spike ones insulin? I’m also concerned that after a while the body will find a way so to speak, and create more gluconeogenesis off of consumed proteins. My cholesterol is still a problem and it has my provider concerned… I’m concerned too, I’m actually in healthcare and I’ve been a nurse for quite some time. At the same time, I am not convinced on the official story that Xperia is actually the positive factor in arterial sclerosis, I’m sure many of us are familiar with this façade, anyways… I just wanted to throw that out there and see what people thought.",0,1767352978.0,carnivorediet,8,0.5,False

I'm just depressed asf,"I'm a 28M pursuing an academic career in electrical engineering. The university I wanna get into requires an exceptionally high (one of the top highest) score on a range of exams on Mathematics, Chemistry, Physics and Literature. I'm exceptionally good in Mathematics, quite good in Physics, but I'm lacking in Chemistry and Literature (quite a lot too).

The issue I'm having is merely that I cannot productively study due to a range of reasons, such as that I'm completely unhappy with my life currently. It's not that I have an issue with having less time to do things, but rather than I live with my father and brother and I'm so tired of this. I do have a job, but I work few hours currently. I really do know that all I have to do is ignore all the things that annoy me but I just can't. I'm constantly frustrated, angry and unhappy. I have to keep myself busy with games/internet browsing in order to calm down myself. I can't have some nice music around because I'm never alone to study, I don't find it helpful to go on libraries since I'm prohibited from drinking coffee or tea or anything that'd help me study better. I have no liberty, no privacy, no money, and I can't even work out.

I don't know why I can't just ignore these. I just can't.

I want to quite my pursue, focus on working a lot, making lots of money, renting a place of my own, study on my comfort and finally enjoy my life and aim to get into the university next year.

Lots of people comment on my age, but what I'm trying to do is for ME. It's not about a career focused on money, fame or glory or whatever. It's about what makes ME happy! It's exactly why I want to give up. Right now I'm studying because I force myself, not because I love it.

And I KNOW that we can't always like what we study, but the thing is.. I like all these subjects. I find them interesting and I want to know more and more and more. I lack the passion to do it.

1q1w44o,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q1w44o/how_do_smart_plugs_compare_to_traditional_outlets/,How do smart plugs compare to traditional outlets?,"Smart plugs are small devices that plug into your regular wall outlets and let you control whatever you connect to them using your phone or voice commands. They're becoming super popular because they make any regular appliance ""smart"" without buying expensive new gadgets.

**What Makes Smart Plugs Different?**

Traditional outlets just provide power when you flip a switch or plug something in. Smart plugs give you way more control. You can turn devices on and off from anywhere, set schedules, and even monitor how much electricity your appliances use.

**Key Benefits of Smart Plugs**

Remote control is probably the biggest advantage. Forgot to turn off your coffee maker? No problem. Just open your phone app and switch it off. You can also create schedules so your lamps turn on automatically when you get home from work.

Energy monitoring helps you see which devices are using the most power. This feature can help lower your electric bill by showing you energy hogs you didn't know about.

Voice control works great if you have Alexa or Google Assistant. Just say ""turn off the living room lamp"" and it happens instantly.

**Smart Plugs vs Regular Outlets - The Real Differences**

Cost is the obvious difference. Regular outlets don't add to your monthly expenses, but smart plugs typically cost $10-25 each. However, the energy savings and convenience often make up for this initial cost.

Installation couldn't be easier with smart plugs. You just plug them in - no rewiring or electrician needed. Converting regular outlets to smart outlets requires professional installation and costs much more.

Reliability can vary. Traditional outlets work as long as you have power. Smart plugs depend on your wifi connection, so if your internet goes down, you lose remote control features.

**When Smart Plugs Make Sense**

Smart plugs work best for lamps, fans, coffee makers, and other simple appliances. They're perfect for renters who can't modify electrical systems. If you want to automate your home gradually without spending thousands, [smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) are an affordable starting point.

**Limitations to Consider**

Smart plugs won't work with high-power appliances like air conditioners or electric heaters. Most handle up to 15 amps, so check your device requirements first.

You also can't control hardwired fixtures like ceiling fans or built-in lights without additional smart switches.

**Bottom Line**

Smart plugs bridge the gap between regular outlets and full home automation. They're cheap, easy to install, and give you modern convenience without major renovations. For most people wanting to dip their toes into smart home technology, [smart plugs](https://athomewave.com/smart-plugs) offer the best bang for your buck.

Traditional outlets will always have their place, but smart plugs add functionality that's hard to beat once you experience the convenience.",1,1767352700.0,ProductNew,0,1.0,False

**What it is**

Nikolytics Radio is a late-night jazz station for founders who work too late. 3-hour YouTube videos. AI-generated jazz. A tired DJ named Sonny Nix who checks in between tracks with deadpan observations about your inbox, your pipeline, and why that proposal is still sitting in drafts.

Five volumes in five days. 70+ subscribers. Over 200k views on the first Reddit post.

It's a passion project that doubles as marketing for my automation consultancy.

**The concept**

The pitch: You're at your desk at 3 AM. Everyone's asleep. You put on Nikolytics Radio. A weathered voice observes your situation with dark humor. He's been where you are. He doesn't fix it. He just... sees it. Then plays a record.

The DJ (Sonny Nix) is a former founder who burned out and now plays jazz for strangers. He has recurring ""listeners"" who write in: Todd from Accounting whose job got automated, Margaret from Operations who finished her task list and doesn't know what to do with herself.

It's 95% vibe, 5% branding. If you removed every mention of my business, the station would still work. That's the point.

**The tech stack**

**Music generation:** Suno

I wrote 49 artist-specific prompts optimized for deep work. Each prompt targets a specific jazz style piano trio, cool trumpet, tenor ballad, etc. Settings: Instrumental only, \~3-4 min tracks, specific mood tags.

Example prompt structure:

    jazz, 1950s late-night jazz combo: brushed kit, upright bass walking gently, 
    warm felted piano carrying the main theme, soft brass pads... 
    [mood tags: soft, warm, slow, lounge, nostalgic]

Generate 3-4 per prompt, pick the best, discard anything too busy or with abrupt endings.

**Voice generation:** ElevenLabs

Custom voice clone for Sonny Nix. I use their V3 model with specific audio tags:

* `[mischievously]` \- dry humor, irony
* `[whispers]` \- punchlines, gut punches
* `[sighs]` \- weariness
* `[excited]` \- mock ads only (ironic use)
* `...` \- pauses

V3 doesn't support some tags like \[warm\] or \[tired\], so the *words* have to carry the emotion. Write tired sentences. Sorrowful observations.

**Script writing:** txt

I mostly write the scripts, claude double checks for optimizations

**Assembly:** Logic Pro

120 BPM grid. Drop the tracks, drop the voice clips. Crossfade. Each episode is \~30 drops across 3 hours. Export as MP3.

**Video:** FFmpeg

    ffmpeg -loop 1 -i image.png -i audio.mp3 -c:v libx264 -tune stillimage 
    -c:a aac -b:a 320k -shortest output.mp4

**The writing system**

Each episode has 30 ""drops"" - short DJ segments between songs:

* **Station IDs** \- Quick brand hits (""Nikolytics Radio... still here."")
* **Bumpers** \- One-liners (""The coffee's cold. You noticed an hour ago. Still drinking it."")
* **Pain points** \- Observations that hit too close (""Revision eight. The scope tripled. The budget didn't."")
* **Testimonials** \- Fictional listeners writing in
* **Mock ads** \- Parody sponsor segments (""Introducing Scope Creep Insurance..."")
* **Dedications** \- ""This one goes out to everyone who almost quit today...""
* **Recurring segments** \- Pipeline Weather, Outreach Report, Inbox Conditions

The key insight: Sonny has emotional range. He's not monotone. He moves between tired, mischievous, sorrowful. He worries about Todd. He offers brief sympathy to Sarah. Then plays a record.

**What worked**

1. **The vibe is the moat.** Most automation consultants are boring. This is different enough that people share it.
2. **Worldbuilding compounds.** Todd's promotion arc. Margaret's puzzle. Callbacks like ""Here it's always 3 AM."" Returning listeners feel like regulars.
3. **Reddit got it started.** First post on [r/productivity](/r/productivity/) got 14k views. Someone called it ""Slop Radio FM."" Now that's a badge of honor we reference in the show.
4. **Daily uploads built momentum.** Five volumes in five days. The algorithm likes consistency.

**What I learned about AI voice**

* ElevenLabs V3 is good but literal. It interprets quotes as character voices (breaks everything). Always paraphrase.
* Tags only work if the model supports them. No \[warm\], no \[tired\]. The text has to do the work.
* Regenerate 2-3x per drop, pick the best take. Same script, different reads.
* Punchlines land in `[whispers]`. Setup is `[mischievously]`. Then stop - no extra lines after the joke lands.

**Time investment**

* Initial setup (prompts, character docs, templates): \~15 hours
* Per episode now: \~2 hours
   * Generate music: 30 min
   * Generate voice drops: 30 min
   * Assembly in Logic: 30 min
   * YouTube upload + description: 30 min

**What could be automated further**

* **Voice generation** \- Currently pasting drops one by one into ElevenLabs. Could batch via API.
* **Timestamps** \- Calculating from bar positions manually. Already wrote a Python script, could integrate it.
* **YouTube description** \- Template exists, still copy-pasting. Easy n8n automation.
* **Episode assembly** \- The real bottleneck. Logic Pro is manual drag-and-drop. Exploring scripted alternatives.

Writing stays mine.

The dream: one-click episode generation. Not there yet, but the pieces exist.

After getting the desired results and I train the AI enough to understand how everything is supposed to work, it will be automated. I need it to be perfectly in sync with my concept.

I actually built it, and the beta is now live.

The app is called Cratebits. I made this because my own playlist had over 500+ songs and I had no idea where to start. I also wanted to save entire albums or artists to my Listen Latter list, which isn't easy to do in the default app.

Cratebits works in a simple cycle:

* Save: Add songs, albums, or artists from Apple Music to your list.
* Queue: It generates a short playback queue from the list for today's session so you don't feel overwhelmed.
* Listen: Discover and save your new favorites to your Apple Music library with quick actions.
* Clean up: Played items are removed automatically so the list stays clean.

If you use Apple Music and have a lot of unlistened music, I'd love for you to try it out.

I'm looking for beta testers right now. **The beta is currently for iOS only** (Android support is on the roadmap), so if you use Apple Music on iPhone and have a lot of unlistened music, I'd love for you to try it out.

**You can sign up for the waitlist here:** [https://cratebits.com/](https://cratebits.com/)

Weeds steal nutrients, water, and sunlight meant for crops, reducing yield and increasing costs. Manual weeding, once the norm, is becoming unsustainable due to **labor shortages and rising wages**.

Today, **smart mechanization** is changing Indian agriculture — and the **Power Weeder** is leading the way.

**One machine.**  
**A fraction of labor.**  
**Maximum productivity. 🌾**

# 🚜 What Exactly Is a Power Weeder?

A **Power Weeder** is a compact mechanized farming tool designed to remove weeds between crop rows while loosening soil for better aeration and root growth. It cleans fields efficiently **without damaging crops**.

It’s no longer just a machine — **it’s a profit-making asset**.

# 🔹 Why Weeding Must Be Mechanized

Traditional weeding problems farmers face:

* Heavy dependency on manual labor
* Delayed weeding → crop damage
* High labor costs → lower profits
* Slow field work → reduced yield
* Hard/rocky soil → weak plant growth

📊 **Proper weed control can increase yield by 25–40%**, directly boosting income per acre.

How do I succeed without any skill? Without ""face""card? Without wealth or connections?

I used to have a good face as a kid naman, I have good features, people always thought I have ""Indian"" blood. Ang sakit hindi ako naging maganda pag laki ko, hindi naman sobrang ""hindi maganda"" but people I know, both elder and younger than mine are prettier. I have nothing against them lalo pa relatives ko but I can't help to feel insecure, bakit yung younger cousin ko mas maayos pa sa akin, bakit Yung ka-age ko she can carry and fix herself. Why can't I? I gained weight when I was 7th grade, I don't mind it before pero ngayon I never loses weight again, alam ko sa unhealthy eating habits ko rin toh. I stopped growing in height, I used to be one of the tallest. I used to have silky hair, nasira siya, nag-pa rebond, cycle yan and now sira pa rin. It's buhaghag na ewan, add pa na I have gray hair, I got bullied on elementary because of it. Now, I am often called/told to look like a ""nanay"" (I don't mean to insult). I don't have clear skin as well, I am ""balbunin"" makinis ako nung Bata sa body, though I got one would mark on my left leg ito Rin yung sa pagkakadapa ko. My eyelashes used to be thick and long naturally, my lips were pinkish this was on pandemic, I was at Senior High School when I lose that features. Stress, probably. I wear glasses too, yes I feel insecure about it.

Aside from looks, I'm also average in academics. Weaknesses ko written exams, weakest subject ko is math sobrang weak ko at it as well as physical education. Since kid, I'm all aware physical activity is not my thing, I'm so embarrassed about it. Guess what, I can't even run properly, Lalo after  nung pagkaka-dapa ko, may something sa loob Ng tuhod ko na kapag tumatakbo Ako sumasakit siya, bumabaliko. What I'm good at? Nothing, a bit of poems maybe pero Hanggang doon lang. What hurts is that Wala na Rin akong drive to do it, I was once an aspiring writer pero nawala na rin passion ko. I feel insecure sa shs/college, my classmates are so good at speaking, debating, they can draft policies and such, galing nila mag plan, mag host, mag-organize. Ako, nakikinig lang sometimes mali pa nagagawa ko.

I'm bad at everything, long story short. I cant sing, I can't play instruments, I can't dance too, sobra. I really can't dance, every school task na may dance, Hindi ko na-kukuha agad. I got laughed at, make people annoyed. Hindi ko ginusto pramis, but that's how really my body is doing it. Ewan ko ba, may something talaga sa utak ko when doing tasks, I'm bad at arts and crafts too, I tried to draw but I really can't do it, and so do was painting. Yes, I'm bad at all fields you can think of. Sports? Culinary? Science? Medicine? Law? Business? Nah! I'm good at being in all of them. I can't do basic skills, sobrang unskilled ko sa lahat, as in lahat. Parang every aspect, may weak part Ako or weakness ko. Sobrang hirap, sobrang ayaw ko makipag socialize knowing I can't offer anything to people. I have no circle too, I don't do hustles so I'm missing out on things too. I don't travel even out of town, I don't visit coffee shops, malls and museums. 

What do I do? Gusto ko lang kahit mag-ka Pera and stable source of it kahit Isa Hanggang Lima na useful skills lang. How do I have glow up?

1q1vtsi,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1q1vtsi/mirror/,Mirror,"From our own points of view, we were both right in acting the way we did at the time.

The mistake was that from the very beginning, we looked into each other’s eyes.



For a long time, I carried the feeling that you were more immersed in your own emotional world than you truly wanted to understand mine. You wrote about me so much, so romantically, so deeply, that I convinced myself you understood me even when I barely said anything, that you could sense when I was happy, when I was sad, when something within me had shifted…I brushed aside my doubts simply because I believed in your words.



But then I began to wonder: have you ever found our relationship strange? We rarely spoke, far less than what even simple courtesy between colleagues would do. When we communicate, it’s almost exclusively about work, and even then we try to keep our exchanges to a minimum. I don’t know when it started, but at some point, we became this distant.



Perhaps it’s because we were both aware of the other’s feelings. We knew they were not supposed to exist, that we couldn’t allow them to ignite, so we tried to suffocate them. Yet emotions do not obey reason. They continue to smoulder quietly, burning the heart from within. And what of our reason? We are both logical people, perhaps even more so than most.



You placed me on a pedestal, idealized me, feared that you weren’t worthy, and feared that I’d see others as better than you. And I, on the other hand felt I wasn’t worthy of you, who was I to think that you’d fall in love with me? And the way you alternated between coldness and warmth was the answer, what caused me the torment and pain. Anyone with a bit of clarity could see that imbalance.



Your ink flowed endlessly. You wrote beautifully with words that moved the heart.

Perhaps you believed that was your way of giving so much for me? 

In reality, I’m just a woman who loves with her ears, like so many others, but I’ve learned that words must be accompanied by presence. Without those letters, I was left asking myself what I had truly received, beyond silences and avoidance.





I don’t want to list every time you hurt me. I tend to forget such things. But there are moments I will never forget.



The moment I told you I loved you, I naively thought it would be reciprocated. I thought you’d say you loved me too like the way you wrote, that we could sit down and have one honest conversation about how we’d face the challenges together. I believed that if, at that moment, you’d said you loved me, I’d have risked everything. Perhaps by now, we’d be somewhere maybe by the sea, blue water and white sand, hand in hand, having a soul-deep kiss. Because I needed a certainty from a man of flesh and bones, not beautiful phrases from an anonymous account hidden behind a screen.



And I will carry it into my next life, when I’m shattered by the cruelty of this world, I asked you to hold me, only once, even if one last time just to calm my heart, that I know I’m not alone…You said it was inappropriate… haha I bet you wouldn't abandon a stranger like that if they ever asked. That moment became a wound that will never heal. Every time I feel weak, when I need you the most, I’d remember as if you with your sharp knife stabbed my heart again and again…



In the past, I’d already learned a painful lesson: when you reach rock bottom, the only person you can truly rely on is yourself. I learned how to hold myself, how to lick my own wounds. I promised myself I’d never trust anyone completely, never allow myself to be hurt like that again, until I met you. I offered the last remaining softness in my heart, only to have to gather the fragments afterward, patch them back together, and struggle to stand up once more.



The most ironic thing is that I even said I didn’t blame you. Because I always found myself placing your feelings before my own. I’m naturally carefree, yet around you, I measured every word, afraid you might misunderstand, afraid you might be hurt...



I once read a book titled 永远有多远 How Far is Forever? and I loved how the author played with words: yǒngyuǎn (forever) and duōyuǎn (how far). The story was very popular among online readers back then, and its answer was simple yet profound: love that is patient, mature, quiet, but deep.



Someone once wrote they’d love me forever. And now, on a cold winter night, sitting with a cup of coffee that has long gone cold, I find myself wondering: was it ever truly a promise, or merely the beautiful words of a poet, words I should never have trusted from the very beginning?",5,1767351694.0,UnsentLetters,3,0.86,False

I'm currently on Day 4 of PEP (Efavirenz, Lamivudine, Tenofovir Disoproxil Fumarate). Would like to ask for advice on how you deal with dizziness/drowsiness, as these are my most common/recurring side effects.

I usually take it around 10:30pm. I experience a little insomnia and a little anxiety but it's manageable. I feel the side effects kick in after 1.5hrs of taking the tablet, I can bring myself to sleep after around 3 hrs of initially taking the tablet. I also eat 1.5-2hrs before taking the tablet.

In the morning, I usually wake up around 6:30-7 am. I still feel the dizziness and sleepiness so I drink water/pocari sweat because it might also be dehydration. I feel better after a meal (breakfast, lunch) but it dizziness still re-occurs (but now a bit manageable). I've also made it a habit to eat little bits every hour (biscuits, etc), just so I have something in my stomach. I find that I can function the best after 1pm onward, but my job starts at like 8am so I have to be able to function much earlier than that lol.

Would just like some advice on how to manage these specific side-effects. Is taking caffeine okay? I'm not really a big coffee guy. Is it possible to take over-the-counter meds that combat dizziness/sleepiness or is it not advisable?

1q1vrs1,https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtOfPresence/comments/1q1vrs1/how_to_actually_build_wealth_the_science_based/,How to Actually Build Wealth: The Science Based Truth About Getting Rich,"Everyone's grinding. 80 hour weeks. Hustle culture.  Rise and grind  posts at 5 AM. But most people grinding their faces off are still broke. I spent years researching psychology, behavioral economics, and studied how wealth actually gets built (books, podcasts, interviews with self made millionaires). The uncomfortable truth? Hard work is the biggest lie we've been sold about getting rich.

Here's what actually works:

**Stop trading time for money**

The biggest trap is the hourly mindset. You work an hour, you get paid for an hour. Sounds fair, right? Wrong. This model has a ceiling, your available hours. Even if you're making $200/hour as a consultant, you're still capped at maybe 40 billable hours a week. The math just doesn't work for wealth building.

Rich people build systems that make money while they sleep. They create once, sell infinitely. Think digital products, online courses, software, content that generates ad revenue. Your goal should be creating assets, not completing tasks.

** The Millionaire Fastlane  by MJ DeMarco** completely rewired how I think about money. DeMarco breaks down why the traditional  save 10% and retire at 65  plan is actually a scam designed to keep you working forever. He's a self made multimillionaire who retired in his 30s, and this book reads like someone finally telling you the truth your parents and teachers never did. The wealth equation he presents is brutally simple: wealth equals impact multiplied by scale. If you can only impact one person at a time (like a job), you'll never get rich. This book will make you question everything you think you know about building wealth. Seriously one of the most eye opening business books I've ever encountered.

**Learn high leverage skills**

Not all skills are created equal. Spending years getting amazing at data entry? Low leverage. Learning copywriting, sales, marketing, or coding? High leverage. These skills let you create disproportionate value.

I'm obsessed with the concept of  specific knowledge  from Naval Ravikant. It's knowledge that can't be trained, can't be outsourced, and is unique to you. It's usually at the intersection of your natural talents and deep interests. Figure out what yours is and double down hard.

The app **Coursera** has thousands of courses from actual universities (Stanford, Yale, etc.) for skills that actually move the needle financially. marketing, data science, AI, financial modeling. Not random stuff. Real high income skills. I used it to learn Python and SQL which literally changed my income potential. Way better ROI than another college degree.

**BeFreed** is an AI powered learning app that pulls from expert talks, research papers, and top books to create personalized audio podcasts tailored to your specific wealth building goals. Built by Columbia University alumni and former Google engineers, it transforms how you absorb high quality knowledge. 

You can customize everything, from a quick 10 minute summary during your commute to a 40 minute deep dive with real examples when you want to go deeper. The adaptive learning plan evolves based on your goals and what you engage with most. Plus there's a virtual coach called Freedia that you can chat with anytime to ask questions or get book recommendations that fit exactly where you are in your journey. Way more efficient than jumping between random podcasts trying to find actually useful content.

**Build in public and create content**

This sounds cliché now, but the data backs it up. People who document their journey and share knowledge online have access to opportunities that literally don't exist for people who stay quiet. You're not just building an audience, you're building a personal search engine that connects you to money.

The ** $100M Offers  by Alex Hormozi** taught me how to package knowledge into offers people actually want to buy. Hormozi built a $100M portfolio of companies and breaks down the exact psychology of why people buy. The  value equation  alone is worth the price. Most people create mediocre offers and wonder why nobody buys. This book shows you how to make offers so good people feel stupid saying no. Had me rethinking my entire business model. If you're trying to monetize any skill or knowledge, this is mandatory reading.

**The 4 Hour Work Week by Tim Ferriss** gets hate for being  unrealistic  but the principles are solid gold. Ferriss breaks down how to eliminate, automate, and outsource your way to freedom. The section on creating  muses  (small automated businesses) is basically the blueprint for passive income everyone's chasing now. Some parts feel dated (it came out in 2007) but the core philosophy of designing your lifestyle first and building business around it instead of the reverse? Revolutionary. This was one of the first books that made me realize trading time for money is a trap.

**Stop consuming, start creating**

Average people consume content. Rich people create it. Every hour you spend scrolling is an hour you could spend building something that generates income. The algorithm rewards consistency and volume. Post daily. Make videos. Write threads. Build your digital real estate.

Check out the **Descript app** for content creation. It's insanely good for editing audio and video by just editing text (yes, really). Makes the content creation process way less painful. You can repurpose one long form video into like 20 pieces of content across platforms. Total game changer for staying consistent without burning out.

**Think in leverage and scale**

The internet broke the old rules. You can reach millions of people from your bedroom. But most people still think locally. They want to open a coffee shop in their town instead of an online business that serves the world.

**The  Almanack of Naval Ravikant  by Eric Jorgenson** is a compilation of Naval's wisdom on wealth and happiness. Naval is a legendary Silicon Valley investor and philosopher, and this book is basically a cheat code for life.

1q1vqzl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Buildingmyfutureself/comments/1q1vqzl/how_to_wake_up_early_and_actually_respect/,How to Wake Up Early and Actually Respect Yourself: The PSYCHOLOGY Behind What Works,"Look, waking up early isn't about joining some self-help cult or becoming a productivity robot. But here's what I've noticed after digging through books, podcasts, and research: Most people who feel like they're losing at life are hitting snooze until 10am. They're letting the day control them instead of the other way around. I spent months researching this, reading books by Navy SEALs, listening to neuroscience podcasts, studying behavioral psychology. And the pattern is clear: How you start your day literally shapes your entire existence.



The crazy part? Biology is working against you. Your brain is wired to seek comfort, not discipline. Society glorifies hustle culture but never teaches you how to actually do it sustainably. So when you can't drag yourself out of bed, it's not weakness. It's just that nobody told you how this actually works.



 Step 1: Kill the Romantic Bullshit About Motivation



Here's the truth bomb: You're never going to ""feel like"" waking up early. Ever. Motivation is trash. It's unreliable, fleeting, and honestly, kind of a scam.



Jocko Willink (ex-Navy SEAL commander who wakes up at 4:30am every single day) puts it perfectly in his book Discipline Equals Freedom: Field Manual. This guy led special operations teams in some of the most dangerous combat zones, and he's basically won every military award that exists. In the book, he destroys the motivation myth: ""Don't expect to be motivated every day to get out there and make things happen. You won't be. Don't count on motivation. Count on discipline.""



The book will make you question everything you think you know about willpower. It's raw, unfiltered, and honestly kind of brutal. But if you want to understand why discipline beats motivation every single time, this is the best resource out there. Insanely good read.



What works? Systems. Not feelings. You need a system that removes choice from the equation.



 Step 2: Understand Your Sleep Architecture (It's Science, Not Willpower)



Most people fail at waking up early because they're fighting their own biology like idiots. Sleep scientist Matthew Walker breaks this down in Why We Sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep and Dreams. Walker is a professor of neuroscience at UC Berkeley, and this book won basically every science writing award. He explains that your body operates on circadian rhythms, not your willpower.



Here's the deal: You need 7-9 hours of sleep. Not negotiable. If you want to wake up at 5am, you need to be asleep (not just in bed, actually asleep) by 10pm. Walker's research shows that chronic sleep deprivation literally shrinks your brain and destroys your decision-making ability. This book will terrify you into taking sleep seriously.



Practical moves:



 Set a consistent bedtime alarm. Yes, an alarm to go to sleep.

 Your bedroom needs to be cold (65-68°F), dark (blackout curtains), and quiet.

 No screens 90 minutes before bed. Blue light messes with melatonin production.

 Wind down with reading or light stretching.



 Step 3: The Night Before Wins the Morning



You don't win the morning when your alarm goes off. You win it the night before. Period.



Before bed, do this:



 Lay out your workout clothes or whatever you're doing first thing.

 Set your alarm across the room so you physically have to get up.

 Prep your morning routine so there's zero thinking required.

 No negotiations. When that alarm rings, you're getting up. That's the contract.



The app Alarmy (also called ""Sleep If U Can"") is genuinely evil in the best way. It forces you to complete tasks like solving math problems or taking a photo of your bathroom sink before it stops screaming at you. You literally cannot snooze your way back to comfort.



 Step 4: The First 5 Minutes Determine Everything



Mel Robbins calls this the ""5-Second Rule,"" but for morning routines it's more like the ""5-Minute Rule."" The first five minutes after waking up set the tone for your entire day.



DO NOT:



 Check your phone

 Open social media  

 Read emails

 Let your brain start negotiating



DO:



 Splash cold water on your face immediately

 Drink a full glass of water (your body is dehydrated)

 Do 10 pushups or jumping jacks to spike your heart rate

 Get sunlight exposure within 30 minutes (this resets your circadian clock)



Stanford neuroscientist Andrew Huberman breaks down the sunlight thing in his Huberman Lab Podcast. This guy is literally mapping how the human brain works, and he explains that morning sunlight exposure triggers cortisol release (good in the morning) and sets up melatonin production for later. His episode ""Master Your Sleep & Be More Alert When Awake"" is probably the best 90 minutes you can spend understanding this stuff.



 Step 5: Build a Morning Routine That Makes You Dangerous



Early morning hours are your unfair advantage. Nobody's emailing you. Nobody's demanding your attention. This is YOUR time.



Your morning routine should make you feel like you're already winning before 7am. Here's what actually works:



 Physical movement: 20-30 minutes. Doesn't have to be CrossFit. Walk, stretch, lift, whatever gets blood flowing.

 Mental clarity: 10 minutes of meditation, journaling, or just sitting with coffee in silence.

 Learning: Read for 20 minutes. Audiobooks count.

 Planning: Review your top 3 priorities for the day.



Total time: About 1 hour. That's it. But that hour compounds into a completely different life trajectory.



The app Finch is surprisingly solid for building morning routines. It's a habit-building app with a little bird that grows as you complete daily tasks. Sounds childish but the gamification actually works.



Another option worth checking out is BeFreed, an AI learning app built by Columbia alumni and former Google engineers. It pulls from high-quality sources like books, research papers, and expert talks to create personalized audio content and adaptive learning plans based on your goals. You can customize the depth from quick 10-minute summaries to 40-minute deep dives, and choose different voice styles depending on your mood. Basically covers all the books mentioned here and more, so if you're serious about the learning piece of your morning routine, it's solid for filling that 20-minute window without much friction.



 Step 6: Respect Yourself Enough to Keep Your Word



Here's the real talk: Every time you hit snooze, you're telling yourself that your word doesn't matter. You're training yourself to be someone who doesn't keep commitments.



Jocko talks about this constantly. Self-respect isn't some abstract concept. It's built through daily actions. When you say you're waking up at 5am and then you actually do it, you're depositing into your self-respect account. When you hit snooze, you're withdrawing.



This compounds. After a month of waking up early, you start seeing yourself differently. You become someone who does hard things. That identity shift bleeds into every area of your life.



 Step 7: Handle the Inevitable Failure



You're going to fail. Some morning you'll sleep through your alarm or you'll be up late and genuinely need the sleep. That's fine. What matters is your response.



When you fail:



 Don't spiral into self-hatred

 Don't use one failure as permission to quit entirely  

 Just get back on track the next day

 Zero judgment, zero drama



The goal isn't perfection. It's building a consistent pattern where 80-90% of the time, you're winning your mornings.



 Step 8: Connect It to Something Bigger



Waking up early just to say you did it is weak sauce. You need a reason that actually fires you up.



 Are you building a business that requires focused work time?

 Training for something physical that demands early workouts?

 Working on creative projects that need uninterrupted flow state?

 Trying to level up your skills before the rest of the world wakes up?



Your morning routine needs to serve a bigger purpose. Otherwise, your brain will correctly identify it as pointless suffering and sabotage you.



Tim Ferriss talks about this in The 4-Hour Workweek. Ferriss is the guy who basically invented lifestyle design as a concept, and he's built multiple successful businesses by questioning conventional wisdom. His point: Don't adopt someone else's routine just because it sounds impressive. Design your mornings around your actual goals and values. The book is packed with unconventional strategies for building a life that works for you, not against you.



 The Bottom Line



Waking up early isn't magic. It's a skill you build through systems, not willpower. You're fighting biology, habit loops, and years of conditioning. But the payoff is massive: You get your time back. You build self-respect. You start each day with momentum instead of scrambling to catch up.



Your environment and preparation matter more than your motivation. Your consistency matters more than your intensity. And your reason for doing this needs to be bigger than just wanting to feel productive.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

…it’s been a while since I loved someone who’s not related to me,

…it’s been a while since I felt I was worthy of someone’s time,

…it’s been a while since I was happy with how I look,

…it’s been a while since someone asked me “How are you?”

…it’s been a while since I felt relieved,

…it’s been a while since I had my morning coffee without being tired of worrying,

…it’s been a while since I celebrated my birthday like I used to,happy.

I don’t want to go any further, I just want to say to people who find this post:

1.Those who are in the same situation: This will end someday, either with a bad or happy ending, it’ll end.

2.Those who are not: Read carefully what I wrote, make yourself a cup of coffee, and think about where you are in life right now. Get back to this post, read each segment, and think : can something you are doing right now lead to that position?

Since I will not reply to the comments, I will read them though (if there are any). I wish you all the best. I just needed to share this since I don’t have anyone to talk to about it. I hope times will get better soon.",1,1767349742.0,mentalhealth,0,1.0,False
1q1v93z,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1q1v93z/coming_out_of_an_emotionally_abusive_8year/,Coming out of an emotionally abusive 8-year relationship,"I (32F) am coming out of an eight-year relationship and I’m still reeling from everything that happened. Back in August, my partner (33M) and I got into an argument and he flippantly told me to kill myself. I sat with the weight of what he said for a while, and I ultimately decided that on this planet of 8 billion people, I could probably find one person who wouldn’t speak to me that way in an argument. I ultimately decided to end things.

What made the choice particularly hard, besides the amount of time spent in the relationship, was the fact that we own a home together. We are currently in the process of selling the home and are closing in a week. We’ve kept the lines of communication open given the pending sale of the home, and over the course of that time he has continued to say really hurtful, demeaning things to me. He threatened to hit me when I suggested he partially contribute to the mortgage after moving out, he made fun of my physical appearance by saying I have chubby cheeks and jiggling them at me, has called me a cunt etc.

Despite the things this man has done to me, I somehow am still attached to him. Last week, he invited me over for coffee and I stupidly agreed and ended up sleeping with him. We fell back into our old patterns of texting each other, trying to find reasons to see each other, etc.

Recently, I found out he was on subreddits to sext other Redditors, but he claims he never actually chatted with anyone and he hasn’t visited those subreddits since reconnecting with me. But just this morning, I learned he was subscribed to my cousin’s OnlyFans and paying hundreds over the course of that subscription for god knows what. I understand we aren’t together, but I feel completely violated and betrayed. There are a million girls on the Internet willing to sell pictures and videos of themselves—why choose my cousin? For what it’s worth, we also look nothing alike.

TLDR: Coming out of a relationship that feels to me like it has all the hallmarks of verbal and emotional abuse. Aside from seeking counseling, which I’m currently in, how do I let go of this toxic relationship and move on with my life?",4,1767349652.0,emotionalabuse,4,1.0,False

I started using RedotPay recently and it’s honestly been the smoothest experience so far.
The ""No-Boring"" Highlights:
• Instant Virtual Card: I got mine set up in under 5 mins.
• Apple/Google Pay: It links directly. I’ve been tapping my phone at grocery stores using USDT.
• Zero Monthly Fees: Unlike some other crypto cards that bleed you dry with ""maintenance"" fees.
• Binance Friendly: You can top it up directly from Binance Pay.
The Perk:
If you’re looking to try it, use my referral code gj74e. They give you a $5 USD bonus just for signing up, which basically covers half the cost if you decide to get the physical card later (though the virtual one is what I use most).
TL;DR: If you want to spend crypto like fiat without the bank headache, this is it.

Has anyone else tried this or found a better alternative? Curious to hear your experience with the fees.",1,1767349648.0,Referrals,1,1.0,False
