1halwzo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1halwzo,Soloqueuing in ranked is so painful in this game. I'm still in Bronze. (Winrate of 33%),"I have played exactly 30 games so far and have won exactly 10 of them. I don't know what else to do. I am MVP/SVP in 80% of the competitive matches I play, and I feel like it's impossible to make progress because my teammates always seem die so much. (As evident by my deaths vs theirs in the screenshots.)

I'll try a bit more tomorrow in the hopes that the past 2 days has just been pure bad luck, but if this pattern keeps up then I think I'll just skip the competitive mode in this game.",1,1733782190.0,marvelrivals,0,1.0,False

Hi! I’m in Columbus Ohio and I’m looking for cool women to be friends with! I’ve realized I’m ace for a few years now.

About me: I’m 32, live in Columbus, Ohio, and I’m into all things horror and spooky. I like watching things about Bigfoot and aliens and ghost and unexplained mysteries. I also enjoy playing traditional card games and board games. I like football and I’m 420 friendly. I also am interested in religion and spirituality and I like watching and listening to things about those topics too. 

I’m looking for a friend to get coffee with, hang out with, have movie nights or game nights with, and maybe have some late night smoke sesh philosophical conversations with. 

If you want to message me, please be in central Ohio! ",1,1733782076.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,1.0,False

The [Nextmug](https://amzn.to/41sMUBW) temperature-controlled, self-heating coffee mug is here to ensure your drink stays perfectly warm until the very last sip. Designed for ultimate convenience and comfort, this 14 oz. mug comes in a sleek Almond finish, combining function with style. Let’s dive into what makes this gadget a must-have (or not).

# Key Features

* **Smart Heating Technology**: Maintains your chosen temperature automatically, with a rechargeable battery base that powers the heating element.
* **Sleek Design**: The Almond color and minimalist aesthetic fit seamlessly into any kitchen or office.

But honestly, it's kinda comforting knowing we're all in the same chaotic boat. Got any funny stories or relatable moments to share? Or maybe you've cracked the code to surviving all this madness? Let's hear it!

1halspl,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anthroposophy/comments/1halspl/occult_secrets_of_food_nutrition/,Occult Secrets of Food & Nutrition,"This article draws from Rudolf Steiner's lectures to elaborate on the secret metaphysical effects of various foods on the more subtle, non-physical astral and etheric bodies: [https://esotericnomad.substack.com/p/occult-secrets-of-food-and-nutrition](https://esotericnomad.substack.com/p/occult-secrets-of-food-and-nutrition)

Main highlights:

1. Humans don't just have a physical body, they also have an astral (or soul) body, an etheric (or life force) body, and the ego body. The food we consume not only affects the physical body but also these subtle, non-physical bodies.
2. Food undergoes a spiritualization process during digestion, where it is infused with what is termed as ""warmth ether."" This spiritualization is responsible for some of the differences between in vivo (within the living body) and in vitro (outside the living body) experiments.
3. Consuming meat may make you more materialistic and instinctual since you consume the astral remnants of the deceased animal, which will ground you in more animalistic tendencies. However, if you're not living a spiritual path, a vegetarian diet may do more harm than good.
4. Plants absorb spiritual energy from the Sun aka scalar waves, but Reich called it orgone, Tesla called it Primary Solar Rays, but the ancients called it Chi, Prana, or Reiki. When we consume these plants, they impart this energy to us, thus heightening our spiritual sensitivity.
5. Coffee is good for logical thinking, tea is better for conversations
6. Salt promotes critical thinking, while phosphorous promotes willpower.

Lots more mentioned in the article as well, highly recommend taking a look.

My name is Daniel and I'm from Southern California (the Inland Empire, specifically). I'm just looking for someone to have a genuinely great time with. I'm not a very picky person and I don't really care much for looks. I more so value your personality and how well we vibe, so pretty much anyone is welcome to get to know me! (I mean that in the most non-conceited way possible lol). I would just ask that you be 21 and older.

My interests:

~ As stated in my title I would consider myself the typical nerdy type (gaming, anime, comic books, super hero movies, etc.) If you like share any of those interests then I think we'll get along great lol

~ I'm Black and Cherokee, I'm bilingual (English and Japanese), around 5'11"" but 6 feet tall on a good day.

~ On top of being your typical nerd I am also a huge horror movie fan to the point of considering making my own horror movie. I have a couple ideas and I would love to share them with someone who's interested in hearing them.

~ I listen to any kind of music except country cuz it all sounds the same to me lol. So if that's a deal breaker then I apologize but I just can't get into it. I also used to rap and sing and have been thinking of doing it again. I have made about 9 or 10 songs in total. Let me know if you'd like to hear something I've made.

~ I love coffee and boba so random coffee and boba runs will be a thing. One of my favorite things to is visit a coffee place I've never been to and try out their coffee and see if I'm adding it to my list or favorite spots or if I'm just never going there again. I know, it sounds weird but I promise it can be kinda fun.

What I expect from you:

~ Good communication and someone who likes to go one random coffee or boba runs. Anime lovers and gamers are a plus as well. Would love a gamer friend/girlfriend.",1,1733781722.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False

I asked for his opinion which ghost device he likes and what i should get since the ghost equipment does interact with spirits instead of phone ghost apps. He seems to like the Ovilus ghost box but not the Onvoy. He very much wanted me to save money in case i do want to get one.

1halofz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Seattle/comments/1halofz/luke_the_electrician_checking_in_after_21_years/,Luke the electrician checking in after 21 years,"Hello, Luke the electrician here. I would have responded sooner but I was off traveling to NYC to see a musical (Book of Mormon) and go the the 2024 Nanny Ball with my babe of a wife.

I’m glad so many of you enjoy the little note I left behind a couple decades ago as an optimistic 25 year old about to start making “real money” after getting my 01 Journeyman license. It was not customary for me to leave notes on jobs, but sometimes a little drawing or an encouraging note to the next person in a crawl or confined space (never an F you, it could be difficult enough navigating spaces many people can’t fit into). I loved finding hidden notes from previous generations, especially while working at the old Rainier Brewery when it was sold and then occupied by Tully’s Coffee. Pencilled notes from the 30’s, brushstroke autographs in the old paint shop upstairs, or dirty limericks carved into solid wood walls from the 50s, I certainly thought it would be more than 20 years before someone found a note I left on the back of a junction box cover, but internet stuff would develop and happen and I’d be answering for it to lovers of harmless mysteries, and tradespeople in the PNW who wonder if we’ve crossed paths.

Being a blue collar electrician, I was jealous of the new people and international travel some of my college bound friends had experienced. Within 18 months of writing this note-on-metal, I took off for hitch hiking in Ireland, buying electroclash records in Berlin, getting hit on Boy George in London, and to leave my work a nighttime voicemail letting them know that 6 weeks traveling wasn’t enough and and I’d be back home in a couple more, and if they didn’t like it oh well. That trip I met and befriended guys in the London-area band Armitage Shanks, and a couple years later was asked, despite not knowing how at the time, to play guitar on their upcoming US tour. So I learned how. World travel became US travel with my pal Stacy in garage-punk-whatever band Pony Time. My Seattle musical career perhaps peaked with the infamous Stallion show with brutal attack on me at the Rock ’n’ Wrestling Rager in 2017, which sent me to the hospital, and the band broke up before we could finish our record deal (for those wondering it was not Sub Pop, they were too small). Only a few rare copies of the double-cassingle are out there, don’t even look to buy  one unless you have real folding money.

I travel now still, but not as hard as I did before. I don’t hitch hike to Canada anymore or sleep outside if I don’t have a place to stay, I guess I travel less dangerously. These days, I probably would get all the suggested shots and anti-malaria stuff before going back to India again instead of just saying forget about it like I did in my 20s. The part of traveling I used to do more was the “show up and figure it out maybe without a place to stay, no map, and take if from there.” That kind of travel is almost obsolete what with computers in phones, but it was exciting and thrilling at times being chased by muggers outside Battersea, or stopping a break in at a hostel, getting free classical music performances at churches in the day and clubbing at night in Europe. 

In 2002 I also set a little time project in motion, inspired by the band Negativland. They had made albums as part of their high school senior project, all with hand made covers, and 15-20 years later is was worth money. So I made a record with a 4 track tape, not knowing how to play any instruments, and released it by mailing 3-5 copies to select dance record stores around the country, and a few around town. I sold exactly one copy at the time of its release, and never collected any consignment. Tube Alloy: The Detection of Sub-Atomic Particles started to get interest from underground dance and lofi people, and 12 years after its release I was shipping cases of the record to Canada and Germany for distribution.

I’m rambling here, but I just wanted to share some details of what I was cooking with at the time, where travel led me, what it brought me, and the trajectory it set me on. It’s not been easy but it’s led to a more fulfilling life, better understanding, and a way to connect with people when I may have so many other difficulties connecting. It’s also easier when you’re younger, at 26 I was way more willing to sleep on the floor under a dining table because that was the only spot available.

For by IBEW brothers, hello! I’m no longer a member, I’ve given up construction in 2022. I was in Local 76 last, but started in 46 before getting booted out in my 2nd year, which is why you may not find me on a list there. In my 2nd year I had drawn some cartoons of my foreman, which I thought was somewhat justified considering he used some racialist and homophobic language. The cartoons were so funny and rude that some management got ahold of them and they got faxed around the company’s job sites all over Washington, and yeah that kind of thing will get you fired and banned from some certain Seattle-area apprenticeships around 1999/2000, before they made foremen take mandatory classes on how to not call people f\*gs. 

I hope it’s been a mildly interesting read for you, it’s been fun for me dipping down the road of rocky memories, and thinking back on my rush to see some of the world before it was all catalogued and digitized by someone else. I still want to travel to former eastern-bloc countries and see some of the brutalist and modern USSR architecture before it disappears or becomes inaccessible. I miss a lot of my Seattle friends, but maybe I’ll see you around when I’m not living in the hills of North Carolina.",12,1733781589.0,Seattle,1,0.93,False

Do you think these lyrics convey playful confidence or could they suggest a more manipulative dynamic in the relationship she is describing?

How would an INFP judge this song 🤔 I have mixed feelings.

I emailed one near me and they told me that I was more than welcome and that if I wanted, I could come by Wednesday for a walk-in visit, and coming Sunday for a service. I’m so excited! 

I also got an app that someone recommended me with the Bible (it’s got most of the translations that are used in my native language, I’m dutch by the way! for the dutchies: I’m reading NBV21) and I bought a physical copy that is due to arrive tomorrow.

I’m so excited. I got the email and I stared at it for a few minutes before finding the courage to open it, but she was very kind! Is it customary to bring a gift (I was thinking cookies/other kind of food) to a church walk in?)

Usually on Tuesdays (so tomorrow) there’s a couple of people handing out pamphlets about several topics within Christianity at the mall right beside my home, I was thinking maybe I could bring them some tea/coffee as they stand out in the cold.

1halll4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1halll4/i_went_abroad_and_it_was_all_right/,I went abroad and it was all right ,"Hi friends, 

Earlier this year I started having IBS symptoms and stomach issues connected to eating and feeling a lot of anxiety when I left my home. For a while I stopped eating out, only ate what I believed were safe foods and sometimes couldn't leave my apartment due to the anxiety of not being close to a bathroom if I needed. You know the feeling.

A few weeks ago I went on vacation abroad with my boyfriend and his family. I had been dreading the trip due to my stomach and every new situation I would have to put myself in. The fear of needing a bathroom on the plane, subway or in a city I didn't know was horrible, but thank God I came out all right in the end. 

For me, I think the solution was psyllium seeds and acceptance. I avoided coffee, didn't feel pressured to eat things I was uncertain of and used the bathroom when I needed, and it worked. I did feel anxious and had symptoms several times, but it never became as bad as I had imagined. Honestly I can't believe I made it, and it felt so good to be able to enjoy food with my boyfriend without anxiety, something I haven't experienced in months.

All in all I just want to share this with anyone feeling worried right now. If you're going on a trip soon I really hope all goes well for you as well! ",1,1733781385.0,ibs,0,1.0,False

1halkfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1halkfk/ratio_4_a_bad_brewer_or_bad_design/,Ratio 4: a bad brewer or bad design?,"I've had my Ratio 4 about 3 weeks (from Kickstarter) and have made the decision to send it back based on the feedback I received from my inquiries to Ratio.

I really wanted this dripper to work. Based on the marketing, I thought it would be perfect to approximate a large single cup of pour-over coffee and it was aesthetically pleasing.

For pourover, I normally use a V60 or a NextLevel Pulsar if I'm wanting to experiment. (Just to let you know where I'm coming from)

I noticed that my normal coffee (Methodical Landmark) tasted a bit off.  So, I adjusted the grind size up and down--still off.  (I have an Ode Gen2 for filter BTW).  So, I started paying attention to my coffee bed.

Normally, I don't really put too much into what the bed looks like.  Taste is king.  If the coffee had tasted good, I wouldn't care about the coffee bed and wouldn't be typing this.

Consistently, I noticed that my coffee bed had a divot in the shape of a reverse ""D"" at the front of the filter.  The back portion of the ""D"" was damp, but I would characterized the two sides as completely different. It made me wonder what was going on in there.

Because the brew basket of the Ratio 4 fits so close, you can't see what's happening.

So, I stuck a V60 under the brewer so I could see what is going on.

The Ratio 4 has a circular shower head with about 17 holes. Statistically, you'd expect water to have an equal probability of coming out of any of them to saturate the coffee bed equally and to avoid channeling.

This is not what I noticed.  The 4 holes at the front of the brewer had a much higher probability of having water come out of them than anywhere else.

That is what was causing the big divot in my coffee bed.  I tried to take photos, but it's hard to tell anything, so I made a video of the water coming out.

If you have a Ratio 4 and yours doesn't do this, I'm jealous. I contacted Ratio and they said that they wouldn't expect another brewer to be any different. They said water will pulse out of all of the holes at the end, which it does do . . .but that's a design flaw in my book. They also suggest that I make sure the brewer was level, which I did (no improvement).

Using the V60, I was able to get a great cup of coffee consistently if I stood there and turned the dripper to make sure there wasn't channeling going on. But, obviously doing this defeats the purpose of having an \*automatic\* drip coffee maker.

I'd be interested to hear if other Ratio 4 owners have had a different experience or noticed channeling.

As for me, I've put in an order for an Oxo 8 with the single cup option. The concept is similar, I hope it works . . . I just didn't want a huge coffee machine for a single cup of coffee.

(I do have a Moccamaster Cup One, but it's not the One I'm looking for).

1halft1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaJobs/comments/1halft1/initiative_man_looking_for_a_job/,Initiative man looking for a job,"Good afternoon to you all, dear redditors.
Moved to Canada (Mississauga) a year ago and have been struggling finding a job this whole time. 
At this point I'm more than well familiar with a struggling job market.
One of the things related to it is a big competition, which partially is associated with an overall big amount of applicants to open positions, and scammy/incompetent hiring managers that are biased towards hiring their friends, relatives, or other folks based on their nationality, and not overall competence.
Personally, I've been trying to show initiative while applying to suitable positions, like personally reaching out to hiring managers and owners, and overall trying to maximize a chance of my application to be seen, but it still doesn't feel like enough.

Now let me say a few words about this country:

One of the things I've personally dreamt of is to adopt fully Canadian norms, values, and culture. Becoming a part of this Wonderful society was a dream I never thought to become a reality though. Man, to think that Sum 41 (my all time favorite music band) , Wolverine (marvel), and X mansion (from X-Men movies) are all about canada is just mind-blowing to me.
The other thing (that is currently debatable) is genuine kindness,politeness, and adequate behaviour of Canadians.
Sure I've stumbled across a few crackheads yelling incoherently in public transport, and people that have nothing in common with canadians (besides their status maybe), but I personally don't associate those with Canada, at least because Canadian values are Not about that.

Now about me: 
I'm 29 years old man of many talents. Had been living by myself since 17 (Family struggled with lack of resources, mother thought it would help me get on financial feet faster if I was in conditions where no one could help me. We rarely speak since) so I'm a quite self-reliant person. 
Fluent in 4 languages and have experience acting as a translator/interpreter/proofreader.
Good with computers and IT stuff overall. Have a life long experience using Microsoft word, excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and recently learnt to use SharePoint as well.
Spent most of my life acting as an audio engineer though, recording,mixing,composing,producing - spent almost 10 years doing it, to the point where in last 3 years (before moving to Canada) I literally lived in a record studio. Also, worked as an audio visual technician on a music stage. So anything related to software (managing, not coding) is something I'm really good at. 
Another thing to mention is my experience in customer service and administration.
It's rooted in fact that I've rarely had people in my life to simply fix whatever I needed to be fixed, so I had to learn to do it myself. I have a good knowledge in determining people's needs/issues, analyzing them (comparing to existing possible solutions/offers), and offering the best possible answer aiming at objective solution. Also, the fact that I'm multilingual opens a possibility to approach a wider demographic of clients.
.At this point I feel like I wrote too much, but I'll leave it be...
Have experience in coffee preparation (worked with coffee machines, know how to steam milk and all that, obviously know how to do same things using modern machines that automize these processes) and bartending/hookah preparations. Also, relatively good at cooking and very good at making pancakes (kind of obsessed with them).
Overall, I'm a very assisting, and supportive person and like to help people. 
Been told to have a talent to unintentionally positively influence people around, and known  as a very fast learner.
My last position was an office admin (a temporary job in Toronto) where I've been managing spreadsheets, helping with minor IT related tasks, managing printers and other PC related devices, and overall was a Go-to guy.

By creating this post I was hoping to get in touch with people interested in knowing a workaholic person like me, or at least connecting for networking reasons (finding friends sounds awesome too, since I've already learnt that Toronto's a place of lonely people and am quite alone most of the time).

I recently bought a 1Zpresso X-Ultra grinder and wanted to figure out the correct number of clicks to correspond to a micron grind setting. I used the chart from Honest Coffee Guide. I understand this chart/site might be controversial, but I haven't seen many other people take a stab at it. The best part about this shortcut is that if you don't agree with the math, you can modify it to fit your needs.

To use it, you download the shortcut to your phone and run it. It'll ask you your desired grind size in microns and return a three-digit grind setting using the typical 1Zpresso nomenclature, so 1.2.3 is one full rotation, the second number, the third click.

This can easily be adapted to other 1Zpresso grinders.

Assumptions used:

* 60 clicks is one full rotation
* The grinder can grind from 0 to 1210 microns
* There are ten clicks between each number

I do make some “espresso”, though using the inverted method, which Adler himself never does. I’m considering buying the “Flow Control Filter Cap” to improve the quality.

Are you like me? Are you happy with the quality you get using Adler’s-like methods? Have you bought a Flow Control Filter Cap and found that it actually improves the taste? It costs almost as much as a new AeroPress, and I’m unsure if I’ll notice any difference in quality. What do you think?

Recently I made one for my partner's birthday, it was Gossip Girl themed and was a total sucess! I want to make something similar, but I can't use any of her special interests, except rock bands she likes so I can't think of a good and mysterious theme. I could use their lyrics for some hints etc. but it's not exciting enough.

For my partner's, it had 28 gossip girl emails with a riddle that would take her to a location. Then she would have a puzzle to solve/an object to find that would lead her to the next clue, or it would be a part of the present. She also had a ""kiss"" at each location with something I loved about her:) The central part of the hunt was a mini adventure where she got a scratch card with around 20 small tasks she had to do outside, which gave us an opportunity for a walk around the town while just having fun! The ending was the final part of the present and a small happy birthday surprise with cake and all. It was a lot easier to make as we live together, and my sister will just meet me in town on that day so I can't make any clues or puzzles at home.

I was thinking to make it revolve around the adventure, because she loves long walks and having spontaneous fun instead of just being in a coffee shop the whole day. Maybe I could make a map of some sorts that will lead us to places to eat, have a coffee etc, visit the christmas market!! and do random stuff like that. In the end, it should lead to Pandora so she can choose a bracelet for herself as the treasure.

My name is sanne and im 18 years old. I joined this server because i wanted to find an anwser for something that happend in my past. 

So when i was around 10 younger or older i dont remember, i was on vacation with my dad. Important to the story is that i broke contact with my dad when i was 14 because he did something unspeakeble. So to ask him is simply out of the quistion. 

We were on vacay in germany, where i cant remember. We were camping near a waterfall. And we decided to visit the waterfall. After visiting we wanted to drink coffee somewhere and we walked into the nearest cafe. Important that it really was a cafe because it had a sign where we walked in

When you enterd the cafe you needed to walk though a hall. It ended in a room full of dolls, like to the ceeling all different kinds off dolls. There wass a small bar, that was from like the 70. Kind of cafeteria bar. There was no personal or anyone at all. No benches no seating places. Just those dolls and a bar. 

We walked trough the raks of dolls and everything. When my dad said in a angsty tone we needed to go. My feeling was also scared this was sutsh a weird place. 

So we left, my dad was really in a hurry to leave. When we walked out of the hallway from where we came we saw 2 men. They were dressed in these old butler and cook outfits that you see in movies or a long time ago. 

What i find looking back is that it is weird that my dad was scared. This men is the most vulgar negative narcecistic men you will ever meet. I have never ever seen him scared. And that he left almost running is so weird to me. He is not a small men. 

This happend a long time ago. And even at that time i found it strange. But looking back when im older it makes me wonder what that was. When i was around 12 i tried to look this cafe up but i couldent find it anywhere. 

Im posting this in this group because i have no idea what this could be. Mabey someone has anwsers or could point me into the right directer where i should look.

He works away for two weeks at a time. Fly in fly out job. Has about a week off in between. We’d reached a point we both wanted to meet but he was flying out the next day. It was about an hour drive for me to get to his place. He told me he was so excited, we were just planning to do something simple and quick like coffee or a walk. 

I asked to confirm the time for a sitter as I have kids and he knew this. He read and didn’t respond. I asked once more and it stayed as delivered and unopened. So I never booked a sitter and didn’t go - I’m not paying a sitter and driving an hour for nothing. Later that night, I sent a message saying, “hey, sorry if I put too much pressure on this.

He got back to me another couple hours later apologizing for falling asleep on me. This wouldn’t be too bizarre - we both bonded over being the type to fall asleep often. He’s still managed to talk to me every day - he messages first every time.

I know some LMTs who quit right away and some who worked until delivery. Does anyone have any tips? Particularly body mechanics? Trying to drink water at least. Is it going to get easier or worse and worse until 2nd trimester? I might just have to quit for now ☹️😔,5,1733779883.0,MassageTherapists,6,1.0,False

The doctor advised me to quit caffeine due to heart arrhythmia and palpitations I experiencing

Quitting coffee was a tough decision for me, but I tried my best to stay away from it

However, every time I decide to quit, I end up back at square one, feeling a strong urge to go back to drinking coffee

This makes me feel frustrated, and sometimes I feel like I can't control it

I've started drinking herbal tea as a substitute,But it does not replace coffee ، the challenge is still ongoing

 If anyone has been through something similar, I'd love to hear how you managed to handle this struggle 🥹🫂

I just got a replacement today, it’s the exact same model. I noticed after I ran the first cleansing cycle that, unlike my old one, this new one starts dispensing hot water before the reservoir has completely emptied. The water is hot like it should be, but I’m a little worried that I am in for a future issue because of this and due to the fact that the instruction manual indicated that it should take a couple minutes to dispense. I tried it with a pod and the coffee tastes as it should and it is hot but it almost feels too good to be true.

1hakmud,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1hakmud/should_i_just_give_up/,Should I just give up? ,"I’m a 25M, and I haven’t really been interested in anything long-term until this year. I’ve been living in different countries throughout the year, so I haven’t really put myself out there much - until recently. I’ve been on a few dates from apps, and while they were nice, I just didn’t feel a spark. Either I was honest about it, or they were.

I was planning to take a break from dating when I matched with a girl (F25) who really caught my eye. There was something special about her, even though her profile didn’t have much info, the usual “wine” answers and all that. She liked me first, so I sent her a message. We exchanged a few messages (like 1–2 per day), and eventually agreed to meet since we’re both new to this city and wanted to explore it. I had a short trip planned, so we decided to meet when I got back. Her texting was very straight to the point and slow, but her replies were thoughtful and nice, she asked about my trip and wished me a safe flight back, which I appreciated.

I was feeling a tiny bit sick the day of the date but I went anyway without high expectations. She immediately exceeded them. I thought she might be a bit stiff or serious, but she turned out to be super goofy and open, just like me. The date was great. We did an activity together, and she insisted on going to a bar afterwards - even though it was a Wednesday night. Over drinks, I could tell she was enjoying herself, not just because she said so, but because of her actions: being a little nervous, giggly, and moderatly touchy (like touching my arm and so on when cracking a joke). She also told me, with the right person she was looking for something serious. Disclaimer: We were not drunk.

At one point, I joked that I barely knew anything about her since she hadn’t shared much over text. She admitted that she prefers keeping texting short and that people usually find her more fun and open in person. I appreciated her honesty and didn’t see it as a problem.

When we walked home (going the same way), she held my arm/hand and kissed me before we said goodbye. We agreed on a second date, and she texted me later thanking me for the “fun night.”

After that, though, communication became really slow. I kept in mind that she prefers it that way, so I didn’t overthink it. I asked her out again, and she said she was having dinner with friends that evening but would like to meet before. I suggested a few options, and she said, “Nice ideas, hmm, let’s think about it and decide closer to the date.”

The day before, I texted her to finalize plans, and we settled on lunch. I sent her a restaurant suggestion, but she didn’t reply until the same morning of the day we agreed on, saying it was good and also apologizing for the late answer as she was working late (Which is true as she told me this)

The second date felt great to me, good communication, lots of laughs, and she even asked if I wanted to grab coffee afterward. When it was time for her to go, we kissed again (shorter than the first time, but we were in public, so I get it).

I texted her a few hours after the date, saying I had a great time and hoped she’d enjoy dinner with her friends. Now it’s been two days, and I haven’t gotten a reply.

Is this a sign she’s not interested, or what? I’m confused because the first date felt amazing, and I thought she felt the same. She agreed to a second date, and it went well (at least I think so), but now she’s ghosting(?) me? Should I just move on, or should I text her later this week to ask about a third date?

I know ghosting is common (even though I haven’t experienced it much), but she specifically said she likes keeping texts short, so I don’t want to overthink. At the same time, I feel like it’s just basic manners to reply to a “thanks for the date” text, especially since I bought lunch. To me texting is not important, but clear communication is, which I feel like I, somewhat, got before the second date. She has been online, so she has seen my message. Should I give up?

Any advice? I don’t want to come across as clingy, but I’m feeling pretty lost here. Thanks!



***TL;DR:*** Matched with a girl who stood out; first date was amazing, lots of fun, ended with a kiss and plans for a second. Second date also went well - lunch, laughs, coffee, and another kiss. I texted her afterward, but it’s been two days with no reply. She said irl she prefers minimal texting, but now I’m unsure if she’s ghosting or just not into me. Should I text her again about a third date or move on?

1haklfd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Diamondsreview/comments/1haklfd/beware_of_i1_diamonds_why_experts_recommend/,Beware of I1 Diamonds: Why Experts Recommend Alternatives,"I1 diamonds represent the lowest clarity grade commonly available in retail, with prices ranging from $1,300 to $5,700 per carat – 50-70% less than higher clarity grades. Market analysis shows that these diamonds exhibit visible inclusions to the naked eye, often resulting in up to 40% reduced light performance compared to higher clarity stones.

Most jewelers advise against I1 diamonds for engagement rings, with most customers who initially consider I1 diamonds ultimately choosing SI2 or better clarity grades. Price comparison studies reveal that stepping up to SI2 typically requires only a 5-10% increase in budget while delivering significantly better visual appeal and durability.

This practical guide provides specific strategies for navigating the I1 diamond market, including detailed comparisons with alternative options and expert recommendations for maximizing value within similar price points.

# Bottom Line: I1 Diamonds

I1 diamonds generally don't represent a good value for most buyers. Here's what you need to know:

* Definition: I1 stands for ""Included to the 1st degree,"" indicating diamonds with noticeable inclusions
* Grading: Gemological laboratories like GIA and AGS assign the I1 grade when inclusions are easily seen under 10x magnification
* Visible Inclusions: I1 diamonds have noticeable flaws, often visible to the naked eye.
* Poor Light Performance: These inclusions often result in reduced brilliance and sparkle.
* Durability Concerns: Large inclusions can weaken the diamond, increasing the risk of damage and potentially making it more prone to chipping.
* Better Alternatives: SI1 or SI2 diamonds offer much better quality for a relatively small price increase.
* Proceed with Caution: If considering an I1 diamond, a thorough inspection is crucial.
* **Recommended Vendors**: For a reliable buying experience, consider purchasing from trusted retailers that provide comprehensive grading reports and advanced visualization tools to assist in selecting the perfect stone.

# Who is this for?

* Buyers on an extremely tight budget who understand the trade-offs.
* Those looking for casual jewelry pieces where appearance is less critical.

# Who is this not for?

* Anyone seeking a diamond for an engagement ring or significant jewelry piece.
* Buyers prioritize beauty, brilliance, and long-term value in their diamond purchase.

# Recommendations for Smart Buying

1. Consider higher clarity grades: Look at SI2 or SI1 diamonds for better value.
2. Explore lab-grown options: These can offer better quality at similar price points.
3. Prioritize cut quality: A well-cut diamond can help maximize brilliance, even at lower clarity grades.
4. Inspect closely: If set on an I1 diamond, examine it under magnification and in various lighting conditions.
5. Check certification: Ensure the diamond is graded by a reputable lab like GIA or AGS.
6. Consider smaller carat weights: Smaller I1 diamonds may have less noticeable inclusions.
7. Look for strategic inclusion placement: Some inclusions can be hidden by the setting.

# FAQ

Q: Are I1 diamonds eye-clean?

A: Most I1 diamonds are not eye-clean. Visible inclusions are typically noticeable without magnification.

Q: How much cheaper are I1 diamonds compared to higher clarity grades?

A: I1 diamonds are significantly cheaper. A 1-carat I1 diamond typically costs between $2,100 and $3,500, considerably less than higher clarity grades.

Q: Can I1 diamonds be used in engagement rings?

A: It's generally not recommended due to visible flaws and potential durability issues.

Q: Do I1 diamonds sparkle?

A: I1 diamonds often have reduced sparkle due to inclusions interfering with light performance.

Q: Are there any benefits to choosing an I1 diamond?

A: The main benefit is the lower price point, allowing for a larger diamond within a limited budget.

Remember, while I1 diamonds offer a lower price, they come with significant compromises in quality and appearance. For most buyers, especially those looking for engagement rings or fine jewelry, exploring higher clarity grades or lab-grown alternatives will likely result in a more satisfying purchase.

Tinanong ako ng family ko ano gusto ko kunin na course. Sabi ko hrm, wag daw kasi yun na yung napili ng sister ko (sige okay lang no issue). Tapos sabi ko gusto ko maging veterinarian, pero tinawanan nila ko :( idk why. Then sabi ko fine arts or multimedia arts, sabi naman nila wala daw pera dun :( Tapos ending sabi nila mag architecture nalang daw ako since mahilig naman daw ako mag drawing. Sinunod ko kahit ayoko talaga nun. 

6 years later, ayun natapos ko halos mamatay matay ako sa course na yan. During pandemic ako naka graduate so nahirapan ako humanap ng work  nung mga time na yun. 

4 years na di parin ako nagttrabaho para maging architect. (Working lang ako sa coffee shop ng kapatid ko) Grabe wala ako gana na ituloy maging architect kasi di ko naman siya gusto. Kaso nakakapanghinayang yung pinaghirapan ko ng 6 years sa college.

1haki6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1haki6u/work_crush_advice/,Work crush/ advice?,"Started a job recently after graduating from University. I only planned to take this job for a year to gain the experience necessary so that i can continue studies at a masters level. However during the first few months of this employment so far, someone has caught my eyes and we have been able to get to know eachother through multiple conversations at work. Due to the long hour shifts, these conversations have spanned from minutes to even hours during work and often get very personal due to mutual curiosity. I've never met someone like this before, after being single for a year or so, I really couldnt compare them to anyone else that i've dated or met before. I would usually completely avoid confessing any feelings to a co-worker, but due to unforseen circumstances it looks like we will all be made redundant in the first few months of the new year. So do i shoot my shot and take the risk, knowing that even with rejection, I will likely not have to work with them much longer? Or even better if the feelings are reciprocated and leads to a relationship, then this will not be under the same employment for a long time.

Its very difficult to know if we are just both kind individuals who both like to talk to pass the work hours. I find it difficult to differentiate this as kindness or interest from women of a similar age, especially when i do not usually recieve this kind of attention.  This person is a couple of years older than me but with each shift together I discover more and more that we have in common! Also it makes things more complicated knowing that the other person plans to travel abroad for a few months after this job role finishes (I also love to travel!!! - Im aware enough to not expect to hop on this trip with them FYI).

I do not have many if anyone to talk to about this situation. I think that I'd rather take the risk on something that could be so huge in my life, even if that means a little bit of akwardness initially if rejected as i am preparded to keep it professional if so. I dont plan to confess feelings, but to ask the person out for coffee or something subtle to get to know eachother outside of the work setting. Then i will judge my feelings and the connection from there. Do i shoot my shot?",2,1733778630.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1hakfqm,https://www.reddit.com/r/GiftIdeas/comments/1hakfqm/for_the_healthy_90_grandmother_for_christmas_from/,"For the healthy, 90+ grandmother for Christmas from Santa","The scenario... my grandmother is overall healthy at 93 years old.  She lives by herself (my grandfather passed \~15 years ago), enjoys working outside and does well in most ways.  She's slowed down, but her mind is sharp and she is active.  She attends church every Sunday, loves Cracker Barrel, dresses nice and is loved by many, many people.  

Since my grandfather passed, some different family have taken turns as ""Santa"" to bring some gifts to her home late on Christmas Eve for her to find on Christmas morning.  Nothing overly expensive or unique, but good that she will have something on Christmas (family does get together, but not in the morning... and she has multiple offers to go to others' homes but prefers to stay in her own home and bed - so it's not for lack of trying).  

I'm looking for suggestions of things to include this year... nothing too large or heavy.  

Past items (which could possibly be redone):

* Lotion (Clinique) 
* Puzzles (she has a 90 year old ""friend"" and he comes by often to do puzzles and have coffee)
* Special coffees and teas
* Yearly tea towel calendar (this is something she always likes, so it's a definite repeat)
* Large print word search books
* Nice ink pens and/or markers 
* Bible quotes booklet
* Bath bombs
* Fancy soaps 
* Gift certificates 
* Homemade goodies 

She has plenty of cooking supplies, arts/crafts items, books (she loves the library), music, decor, etc.  She really needs nothing - so these are more of little luxuries that she can enjoy.  

Could anyone suggest something that would be good for a sweet grandmother in her 90s?  I'm game for ideas!

We’re all pretty familiar with the classics—pour-over, French press, maybe even a siphon—but I’m curious: have any of you ventured into more off-the-beaten-path brewing territory?

For instance, have you tried using a clay pot your grandma swore by, cold-brewed tea in a pineapple shell, or a coffee maker fashioned out of lab equipment? What was the flavor like, and did it change your perception of what a great cup of coffee or tea can be?

1hakbmb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hakbmb,Brass Tigers,"Most probably already know this story, but I've been trying to piece together as logical a narrative as I can as to how these brass cats came to be, and would love to see other examples and hear other ideas and knowledge! 


In the 1970s Mattel made a line of figures, Big Jim, as an answer to GI Joe\Barbie and the like that was as if the character came out of a 1950s\60s men's pulp magazine. Cowboy, astronaut, deep-sea diver, and most importantly to our story, jungle explorer. Each figure had an outfit, animals, accessories, and vehicles for their adventure.  One of those animals was a large tiger. 

He-Man comes around in the 1980s and they think, well, we need like a horse thing for him to ride on, but not a horse, how about a cat, hey look, we'll just use these. Change the paint and call them Cringer/Battle Cat/Panthor. 

At some point one of these two part hallow plastic toys gets picked up by someone over in likely India or Eastern Asia where they have a talent for casting brass. Maybe in the same area where the toys were being produced in Taiwan.

They were not sold as a He-Man knockoff but they are, in a roundabout way. Many ended up in the western market for people in the '70s and '80s to put on their coffee table and look swank. There are a wide variety of finishes and forms, but they are all based on that original cat shape. 

Now that I have a couple of these to look at in person I can see that they are also made in two pieces and brazed together. They are not solid as we can get a peek at through the mouth where they were unable to fill and file the gap. More work, but saves material.

I can spot a number of differences, biggest being the size which looks like more of a variance than the 1-2% shrinkage you would expect casting brass. 

The tail seems to be a good place to see that they are in fact two different shapes from the same lineage.
 
Perhaps a Big Jim tiger or MOTU cat was used directly for the first casting (and maybe in more than one shop at different times) and then we have a situation of copy of a copy of a copy oops tail broke off, resculp that, copy, copy, with more changes and overall shrinkage down the line. 

Maybe it was only used as artistic inspiration. 

If anyone knows more about these guys, I'd love to share notes and theories!

I also think I need someone with superior metal working skills to sculpt a set of brass armor. 😆

I hope it resonates with others and isn't too long. I'm beginning therapy in January 2025 (because I need to settle my emotions still) and will unpack this whole relationship with him, and hell, even told him, please as you get to know me, check me for any Cluster Bs because I want help and to be better if I'm broken too! He's a psychotherapist that specializes in CBT, DBT, and with licensure for micro dosing ketamine, not sure that's for me and hope my damage isn't that severe to need it haha. 

MESSAGE TO ALL
Before I begin with bullets to not write a novel I just want to say for everyone reading this that MULTIPLE THINGS CAN BE TRUE SIMULTANEOUSLY! We can love these people and it be true love of the deepest caliber. They can also love us but they have a personality disorder that especially if untreated/undiagnosed may be immature, childish, abusive, and unsustainable in a relationship. We can have compassion for them and they can be the people we fell for and not just manipulated mirroring like we may believe, but they need to keep growing and healing and it isn't our responsibility to be their doormat, or have no boundaries to keep ourselves safe, and wanting healthy love back! In a way for us to healthily move on we have to kind of split THEM to hateful demons because it's hard for many in our mind to wrap compassion and love and not want them in our life still for our safety. If you're feeling that way like I am, ITS NORMAL AND OKAY BUT WE DESERVE MORE! Love/hate them at a distance -- whatever you need to take care of you. YOU'RE IMPORTANT AND NEEDED TOO!

If they aren't in intense treatment and consistently improving and acknowledging they can't be in our lives. PERIOD. We aren't a charity case to just not have a healthy relationship just because we feel bad for them and their hurt life. They do deserve love and a joyful life but it is up to them. They can walk a path of light or destruction and ITS NOT OUR RESPONSIBILITY WHATEVER THEY CHOOSE! If they choose destruction WE DON'T HAVE TO STAY! Okay now me (and I'm obviously condensing to main points because too many details):

** She never was fully diagnosed with BPD but as I have reflected on this second cycle and our relationship I believe she has it especially since 5 years ago she saw a therapist who then told her she may have bipolar or borderline (when I first learned what BPD was) but she wasn't so sure. This second cycle I asked her if she checked that again with her new therapist she has been seeing a few years whom she likes and she said she hadn't and doesn't believe she has it. So as a non-licensed psychologist who never did intake with her I can't say but I highly suspect she has it based on our relationship; you be the judge. I think she does of the high functioning Discouraged mostly with slight Impulsive sub archetype. **


BULLET STORY
- Her and I met in college, turns out we lived in same building, 2019
- She was going through her first divorce and separated. We trauma bonded from similar abusive fathers and upbringing (she was sexually assaulted as a child for many years but not by father but family friend, I was thankfully not, just mental and physical like her)
- Tons in common and physical chemistry to the moon although I felt guilty as a high moral person because she was separated but not divorced 
- 1 month in I went to study abroad thinking it would stay casual but we talked everyday 
- When I got back we saw each other constantly, I felt I was doing push pull because she'd reel me in and I'd say she wasn't ready for a new relationship 
- Ultimately dumped me, I blew up on her, got really drunk and ended up in hospital, had new appreciation for life and reached out, this started split her where I was in the doghouse getting flaked on, ignored, seemed like a different person when I did meet up with her -- cold as ice eyes -- and no apologizing was enough. I said initially I wanted to be friends but my feelings were too strong and so I told her I want more and she threw that back on me. Oh after she dumped me she was with someone new a week later but not official. No break between her husband or me to reflect and heal. 
- This became toxic and lasted until I had no more fight in me on February 2020 when she said we should stop talking and seeing each other -- I was defeated and agreed and she seemed a bit shocked I had accepted it and had no more fight, her and that same guy she got right with were more or less becoming official then as her divorce also finalized. 
- Throughout the toxic half of relationship I was almost failing school and after with the pandemic it took me a solid 8-10 months to rebuild and put myself back together and loving myself
- May 2022 she gets engaged to same guy. I break NC on IG to congratulate her because everyone does deserve to be happy. We start to slowly talk as friends. 
- July 2023 I meet her and fiance at food festival. Introduce them to all my friends of huge social group I created. I'm being a bit petty. 
- September 2023 we meet for coffee as friends after her honeymoon and she tells me they're exploring Polyamory and did so on their honeymoon -- and don't get me started on that relationship style and the kinds of people it CAN attract -- I find that interesting but think nothing of it (also because then I think it's kinda silly). Also I apologize for some of my behavior before. She accepts but doesn't offer any apologies herself for her part which I find curious but whatever.
- November 2023 we spend a day at the museum and the sparks start but I do nothing of it and only justify some of the flirting because they're Poly I say. 
- December 2023 see each other for two events with friends but nothing really and in January I say it was fun let's do it again soon and nothing comes of it.
- April 2024 I say let's meet up for coffee again if it's okay with husband.
- May 2024 We meet up for coffee, I share I went to a sex club and she's VERY INTRIGUED, asks if she can go and I say only if husband is cool with it, she answers he would be and therapist thought it might be good for them too. Extra flirty that night, I give into my desires and bet her something sexual for winner of putt putt (I'm wrong for this but justify it because of Poly statement), I win, she agrees to bet and on walk back to car grabs my hand and even kisses ME
- Cyclone of five months begins. Her statement of being unhappy with husband all this time, the intense care she has for me, me trying to make things right from feeling like I screwed up five years ago, us saying how much we have changed and grown, admitting we love each other, in love, she said I'm her twin flame, and husband unfortunately got swept into this, nonstop texts, lots of sex that made us guilty, it feeling like a huge romantic movie and second chance love affair, my guilt and morals but sunken cost fallacy, me sticking up for her with friends and family, me telling her she needs to do what she wants to do and not people please for me, etc etc etc. 
- I believed maybe she wasn't really Poly but just needed healthy love and I was trying to show it and I know I played a part in the marriage ending and will hold that sin but I'm not the total cause, she ultimately like a flash even after marriage counseling, dropped him, and moved into the 7th floor of my building again and we ""played house"" for over a month (I took care of her, built her furniture, husband level love, etc. you know)
- October 2024 minor disagreements and me noticing our values aren't aligning but she isn't willing to work with me or be open minded and comes to a head when one disagreement October 16th about women in education turns into a huge argument and her having a panic attack really begin to give me pause that she isn't ready and I'm worried. She also brings up and we discuss being Poly (which I thought was put to rest) the next two days resulting in me basically saying it isn't for me but we aren't exclusive yet but I'd want to be primary at least which she can't guarantee. My birthday party potluck 18th she's then no longer wanting to hang off me in front of all my friends (30+ people) but mingling and I'm introducing her to people. She connects with known fuckboi of group who I'm leery about and only met a few times. She's leaning on me throughout the night but I notice him give her a more physical hug to depart. I share my insecurities and jealousy about him the next day. She smiles and acknowledged but said nothing. The 20th finds us quietly driving to pumpkin patch with more talk of her friends (only has 2 good ones over six years and one lives 8K miles away in UK) not liking what I've said and I'm controlling, etc. So argument at pumpkin patch. Do my best to empathize and make peace but ultimately the next morning I ask could you date, she says no, and I say how are we then and she says cause our bond and love. After her comment about my friends which I feel is her starting to try and isolate me I push for space. 
- The texts and sadness begin on her end and ultimately I say I feel taken for granted and she writes a beautiful email saying we should do no contact then. Tears are shared but hope is we can revisit this later when she's healed or she figures out if she's Poly or Monogamous or just be friends. 
- 6 days later I randomly get protein bars in the mall and catch her with the guy I was insecure about and of course she lied to him that we were just friends. I feel so betrayed I actually get mad at her in public. Why him, why so soon, she said she was gonna take a break and heal, date poly people, or even girls. 
- Next day she says how unbelievable I was, and come get your shit out of my house. I tell her toss it and she's safe from me and my outbursts but write an email to her explaining why I feel what she did was so hurtful, but I still wish her love and compassion and all of it was real in my eyes.
- Slanders me the next day with all the psychology babble in the book. I calmly say thanks for sending this I receive it with love and continue to wish her well and then the very next text is her playing victim being scared of me and my punishments -- I tell her my ""punishments are over"". 
- Guy I caught her with meets me at party 4 days later and wants to shake my hand, I refuse and he chokes me and says he didn't know! Yup! I punch him in the face from self defense. That felt awesome.
- So that happened and third thing being dumped on me is getting laid off. Fourth thing is sisters relationship I looked up to for Monogamous standard of seven years had her partner go on crazy drunken binge and cheat and now obliterate the relationship 
- ALL OF THAT, STILL GONNA EVENTUALLY PICK MYSELF UP AND MOVE FORWARD

CONCLUSION 
So that's my story. I effectively dumped her the second time. It's left me hollow for sure because the intensity was SKY HIGH. I know I hold a lot of blame and am immoral for some of what I took part in and I have LOTS to unpack in therapy to love myself healthier and find a healthy love in due time. There's many more details if people want it to scrutinize if she has BPD or not but believing she does and it may be undiagnosed makes me just feel extra compassion for her (that doesn't mean I need to take the abuse) but also wouldn't change our values not aligning more than likely still. I want kids. She doesn't. I wouldn't mind being married. She's done after two. I'm monogamous I really feel because Poly is too messy. She's Poly. I'm independent and open minded. She's close minded liberal. That's just SOME of the misalignment on top of all my friends and family hating her now so it would be a big mountain for her to climb for a third chance. 

FINAL THOUGHTS 
Even still I wish her joy and happiness because everyone deserves to be healed and loved and love others and find their life's success. Life is already hard enough, so why should I make it more miserable with a bad partner? That's what I'm learning crying everyday during no contact. It's complicated. We can love them but we have to love ourselves and our standards even more. Her living upstairs only a 30s walk from me makes it definitely tougher! We gotta get back on the horse and yes it technically only spanned 6 months the first time and 5 months the second across 5 years of loving her the whole time (but moving on in-between) but I did learn a lot about me and did love fully and that's beautiful, and I guess I could have spent 20 years with her and be more destroyed -- so silver lining there! I feel bad for the men/women especially in the Poly space she may be wringing destruction upon but THAT'S NOT MY RESPONSIBILITY OR YOURS!

LADIES AND GENTLEMAN, THERE'S REALLY ONLY 3 CHOICES:

1. HEAL and then eventually find our love and joy again and live a life of happiness and abundance with our future lover(s), our community, and our passions
2. STAY STILL and never move past this and live a total life of misery on that hamster wheel of doom
3. END EARLY (you know what I'm implying)

1hak99k,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHR/comments/1hak99k/reported_boss_for_harassing_other_employees_us_ny/,Reported Boss for Harassing Other Employees [US] [NY],"I’m a manager at a retail store, and we recently had a new general manager take over. I previously worked with him, and have known him for years. He's always been very particular and had very high standards. when we learned that he was taking over, I tried to prepare the staff to adapt to his pace, but I quickly realized that this was futile. The man takes issue with EVERYTHING. There is never a moment where he will just say ""good job!"" every single moment he is speaking to an employee, he is critical and providing feedback. Oftentimes, the employee receiving feedback did the exact thing that he wanted them to do, he just needs to hear himself say something.

I’ve always found him to be annoying and overbearing, but it's not a difficult job, so I always just smiled and nodded during his inane feedback sessions. However, employees started approaching me about his behavior. I’ve always known that he was a touchy guy; excessive handshakes, hugs, touching hands and shoulders at strange times, but every time someone called him out for it, his responses were either ""I’m Puerto Rican, this is how Puerto Ricans are"" (which is crazy, because I know many Puerto Ricans and Latinos from different backgrounds and I have never had to address their physicality with them), or ""I’m a Christian"" (implying that because of his devout faith, he cannot be sexually or physically inappropriate, which is also crazy because Christianity and inappropriate touching go together, well... hand in hand).

For a few months, I’ve tried to be a sounding board for our employees, and I’ve let them vent their frustrations to me in confidence, and let them know that regardless of what he says, they are doing a good job. But I learned a few very serious allegations this week:

He has physically lifted an employee off of the ground from behind without her consent to celebrate a very minor achievement. Typically I would just say good job, or throw a high five her way in this situation, but he thought it was appropriate to lift her up from behind without asking!

He also insists on holding employees’ hands while speaking to them and I have been told that he caresses their hands while holding them.

There is one employee in particular that he consistently speaks to regarding dress code. in my opinion, she is one of the best dressed employees. It's a clothing store, so clothing is often a topic of conversation, but when someone has on a very nice outfit, typically the conversation stays centered on the clothes: “that's a nice sweater! where did you buy those pants? you're outfit looks great today!” In the event that someone's outfit is not in dress code, I usually just say something to the effect of, “please don't wear that again” and explain why the clothing doesn’t fall under our dress code. This manager however makes comments on people's bodies. In one instance, while holding an employee's hand he said ""you are too beautiful to smoke cigarettes."" She immediately notified me and I told her that this obviously crossed a line and that I can help her speak to HR to document this case, but she ""didn't want to get anyone in trouble."" I explained it's not about getting people in trouble; it's about having a safe and supportive work environment. She also said that she has seen him “leering” at her and staring her up and down.

The following day, she described an event that happened a few weeks earlier. The manager bumped into her at a coffee shop while she was on her break and proceeded to show her a video of his apartment. The video showed his living room, kitchen, and bedroom, and at one point, the camera reveals a mirror, where our boss was clearly visible just wearing his underwear. She was mortified and told him that she didn't want to see that, and he laughed and said not to tell anyone.

Upon hearing this, I knew I had to speak up. I spoke to a couple of the employees who have approached me about his behavior (not his overbearing management style) and asked if they would be comfortable with me sharing their experiences with HR. They all agreed, so I emailed our corporate HR representative and explained the situation. I told him to call me on my personal phone at any time, and that I will provide him with the contact information of the impacted employees as well.

In my email, I specifically pointed to the provisions of the company's anti-harassment policy that he violated. But there's a catch. When I met him years ago at a different store, he was accused of harassment (out of respect for who was impacted, I won't go into detail), but it was a cut-and-dry sexual harassment case: making inappropriate comments about another person's body. I was not a manager at the time, so I did not get all of the details, but he did not get fired. The policy states there is a zero-tolerance approach to harassment.

It's awful to say, but we were all willing to accept his shitty behavior until it became physical and sexually-tinged. I’m heartbroken that my employees have been hurt by him, and I wish I had addressed their concerns sooner, but every time I directed them to HR, they were reluctant because they didn't want to be the one to speak up. This is why I decided that I had to speak for them.

I’m now riddled with anxiety because I haven't heard back from HR. I’m worried that he's going to get away with it again, and me reporting it will only hurt the employees he is already victimizing. It's gotten so bad that most of our regular employees are looking for work elsewhere (I’m not discouraging them) and people just aren't coming in, they're posting their shifts or calling out.

If he isn’t fired, I will have to leave, I can not work with this guy anymore after I have seen and heard how he treats our employees. I’m also worried about retaliation. Even if he isn’t let go, I know that me and the people who came forward will be put under the microscope and penalized for the most minor infractions. I’m doing everything that I can to protect my team and make sure that no matter what happens they are safe and have a paycheck coming in.

I sat in some of the **pottery barn kids swivel chairs,** and they were the most comfortable potential nursing chairs I've sat in. Concerns: the cost is overwhelming. i own pottery barn and west elm furniture, and although it looks cute, it doesn't always hold up. But I have yet to sit in any nursing chair more comfortable than the pottery barn one

The **babyletto yuzu crib** seems like a great multi-use crib that would eliminate the need for a bassinet + a crib + a toddler bed. I'm not too worried about the price since family said they'd gift it to us. Concerns: I don't want folks spending so much on a crib when you can get one for $200 from Ikea (on the other hand, we'd need to buy a separate mattress, bassinet etc etc). I keep reading that it's made of soft wood, and babies gnaw on it, so it doesn't look nice long term. If it's an investment piece, I want it to last. Also, my main reason for liking it is the mini crib between the bassinet and crib, but I've read that some people can't fit it through their bedroom door. We'd want to wheel it around. We're a tad minimalist, so we would prefer to have one thing that does many things, rather than many things that do only 1....

I plan on buying the chicco bravo primo, but I want a baby bassinet for when baby is little. This travel set doesn't come with one. I keep seeing the ladies at my local coffee shop with the **uppa baby**. The cost is wild... but if I buy a separate bassinet stroller along with the chicco, the cost will be roughly the same as just getting the uppa....

I sometimes worry that I love some of these things because TikTok and YouTube have convinced me these are the best...and maybe I'm just not aware of what else might be good.

I just wanted to share my story, because if I can help just one person that will make me happy.

I am 23M now.

2020- I had to quit baseball due to injury, came home from florida and experimented with streaming video games. During this time I switched from vyvanse to focalin. I started experiencing the ridiculous “high” from it and I got addicted. I didn’t think much of it, but that’s where the story starts.

2021- my family moved from my childhood city to a newer place. I didn’t know anybody, but I was doing online school and stayed in touch with my friends who now lived about 40 minutes away. This is about when I started using zyn instead of vaping. Then I started using weed gummies every night. So I was on Focalin, Cotalopram, Trazodone, Marijuana, and Nicotine. I was full of emotion(less)s and I wouldn’t leave my room. I would play video games from the time I woke up (noon) until I went to sleep (3am). I would also consume roughly 5000 calories of food from the “munchies” of both trazodone and weed. I became depressed and my grades were terrible. My counselor told me that I would get kicked out of college if I kept doing so poorly. Another note is that I would wake up so pissed off, probably withdrawing from the focalin and hungover from the weed and trazodone (100mg). I 

2022- Started the year on the same regiment, but started working out vigorously to help with the anxiety in the morning. It was helping a lot, but I still had terrible social anxiety, pending doom, and paranoia. I wasn’t able to even leave the house. Around fall, I started the new workout regiment that i stayed on until late 2024. This was two vigorous cardio exercises. Fall of 2022 was when I got off the weed. Weed withdrawal is THE WORST I have ever experienced, but in the end it worked. Took 2 weeks for the symptoms to pass and about a month to get back to normal. It was during this time that I lost about 60 pounds and got in great shape. I was still going through the rough patch due to the Focalin, Nicotine, Trazodone, and now Zoloft instead of citalopram. Couldn’t figure out what the issue was.

2023- started the year where I left off. Spring came around and I started looking for a girlfriend, which I got. She was a bitch, but initiated the process of me getting away from focalin. Fast forward to the end of the year, and I was more socially active, had a job, but still suffered from the anxiety of focalin. I was still going to sleep at about 1:30am and waking up at 11ish, and still was unable to do anything until I did my two workouts, which took me until about 5PM to complete. I started turning my grades around and it started looking good. I broke up with my ex due to toxicity, and knew that the following semester was the one I needed to succeed in, in order to chase my dreams and prove that I was not a loser. I had 6 classes (the most I had done in previous years was 3). So this was the big semester. 

2024- the year where my life turned around. February I met a girl, who I am still with. She ended up pregnant with my child in February. Valentine’s Day, am I right? At the time, I was only taking the first class (which I had a C in) and was starting my other 5 in the next week. I knew that with the baby coming, I needed to turn my life around and quick. So, while my girlfriend was laying in bed everyday, I devoted my life to studying. I ended that semester with straight A’s. In June I had two summer classes, both A’s. So I was ecstatic. I started my real estate classes in July, and started weaning off the trazodone and focalin. I passed the real estate exam first try two months later, taking me to September. With the due date of my child being November 7th, I knew I had a short amount of time to address the working out issue, which I still suffered from. I expressed this to my doctor and we devised a plan. I eventually got down from 100mg trazodone to 10 mg, and from 40 mg focalin to 17.5mg. The anxiety was better, but still there. Early October- baby was coming early, so I had two weeks to prepare. I switched from focalin to vyvanse 40 mg, which I felt nothing on. So I took focalin IR 5mg with the 40 mg vyvanse because I knew I responded better to methylphenidate. BOOM- due date is here, so I only took the vyvanse to the hospital. I couldn’t think throughout the day, my mind was way weaker on vyvanse. I started working out once a day in order to have enough time to deal with my child. About a month after my child was born, doctor switched me to Concerta. I was on generic 54mg and that was a far lower dose of vyvanse and focalin IR I was taking. The generic Concerta was terrible, but MUCH better. Once my body adjusted, I focused better than vyvanse, but I was able to stay centered and calm. I was finally feeling the change I was aiming towards for the past 4 years! Something was still not right though, as I felt very dumb and had massive headaches. The generic Concerta has a different release mechanism than the brand Concerta, and when I realized this, I made the switch to brand name. Unfortunately, I had to pay $131 for 8 pills of brand name Concerta. But I stopped drinking coffee when I started it, and I felt it very subtly, but knew it was right for me. I started doing WAY less nicotine too, which I seen benefits from. But STILL, something felt off. I also started to only workout once a day and it finally felt good. But now, I was able to go to work and study in the mornings and then workout later when I had time. Words cannot describe how happy about this I am. But since I still felt “dumb”, I wanted to start drinking coffee. So today, I took my Concerta, and an hour after I took it I drank some coffee. BOOM- no fidgeting, no jitters, and haven’t felt the need to workout yet. I’m going to run today just because it is healthy, but I don’t feel shitty like I normally would until I workout. Best day I have had since 2019, and the long road has taught me many lessons.

I am starting my real estate career January 2025, so I knew I had to figure my life out quickly, so I would be able to work a full day without dropping off. Today was the first day I can confidently say I can do that! 

Moral of the story- life won’t change until you MAKE the changes. Rocky Balboa said it best- 

“It ain’t about how hard you hit, it’s about how hard you can get it and keep moving forward- how much you can TAKE and KEEP MOVING FORWARD…

If you know what you’re worth, then go out and get what you’re worth, but you have got to be willing to take the hits, and not pointing fingers saying you ain’t where you wanna be because of him or her or anybody! Cowards do that and that ain’t you! You’re better than that!”

For anybody struggling with stimulants and the day to day life- take a step back and assess the situation. Think about what the problem COULD be and make the change. Trust me, it BLOWS to make the change, but it will pay off in the end. Never lose hope, always keep pushing. 

None of this would be possible without my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. He gives me strength everyday to push through all obstacles. God and Jesus have a plan for me, it was up to me to push through the challenges in order to learn the lessons I needed to learn to succeed on the path that They chose for me.

Life is long, but short. When you’re on your deathbed, make sure you have no regrets. Live life how you want to. Do everything possible to make your dreams a reality, and trust the process. It may take weeks, months, or even years, but you will eventually get there.

1hak5cy,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMenOver30/comments/1hak5cy/how_fast_does_this_get_better/,How fast does this get better?,"I M[30] am just very bummed. This post is equal parts venting and inquiry. It's also extremely long, and for that I'm sorry.

In February of this year, 8 months before my 30th, I met someone, F[24], who kind of saved me. Nursing school had been a bitch (still is), my job was a nightmare and I had been recently diagnosed with herpes. It wasn't ideal and drove me into a deeper depression than I'd ever felt before. Regardless of this nightmare and having no time at all I still pressed on with Bumble. I was a chubby kid who grew out of it, and while I still have some body issues I realized I did well for myself in the hookup scene (the herpes put the kabosh on this as I don't want to infect anyone). So in February I started to date to marry with my intent being to go slow. 

My first match, aforementioned, was beautiful. She was also incredibly kind and intelligent. We talked on Bumble every day for a week, eventually switching to Instagram, and then WhatsApp. She was in New York from Colombia as an au pair, so her English was slightly limited. But over the course of our relationship her English only improved. My Spanish did not but I didn't have much experience in the first place. 

Fast-forwarding to July after 5 months of dating she went to see family for 2 weeks in Colombia. During her time there she was not very responsive, and when she came back she was distant. A week after her return, I still hadn't seen her. I booked an AirBnB as a surprise, thinking some alone time would help (I was living with family at the time) and told her to meet me there. She accepted, we talked, drank, and had some food. 

After a few drinks I mentioned how quiet she'd been lately. She became a bit withdrawn but said everything was fine. Hopeful, I accepted this at face value and said, ""Oh thank God. I thought you were ending things"". She replied ""No, I think I am."" Which made me literally cough up my drink. She cited missing Colombia and her family, and I understood. We spent the next few hours hugging/kissing and talking about how much we liked each other. Then I drove her home, feeling a little broken on the ride back.

The next few weeks were brutal because work and school were still punishing, but I lost the part of my life that motivated me to get through each week. After a month and a half of torture I broke down and texted her (a week after we ended things I thought I saw her location change on Bumble, which was not healthy to even look into). This turned into a phone call and I asked her if her reason for ending things was still true, which she reiterated was, but that her family pressured her to stick it out for another year. Before she could say anything further I told her I wasn't looking to rekindle anything, especially if her end goal was to move away again. I didn't want to seem insecure so I didn't mention Bumble. We had an incredible talk and ended on another good note. 

September rolls around and another person, F[30], I knew in highschool reached out via complement on Bumble. We hit it off and got coffee, where we talked about work and life (she's a doctor and we only talked shop for the first hour and a half). Unfortunately, after the first night we had sex I gave her the most diffuse case of herpes I've ever seen. I felt terrible, and did everything I could to make her feel better. She's an amazing person and doesn't blame me. It's now been three months since we started seeing each other and she's perfect in every way, though I feel a spark could be missing. I'm trying not to talk myself out of something great though.

A month ago F24 reached out to me again. She was crying and didn't know what to do, saying she had a heart condition (which I told her she probably had after discovering she was experiencing intermittent palpations and had Raynaud's, though she never got a Holter monitor for even after I begged). She told me I was the last person she wanted to bother with this but didn't know where else to turn. All of my feelings for her, which never completely dissipated, came flooding back. The next few weeks were spent searching for cheap medical care - as an aside I'm still angry about accessibility here. We finally got her lab work (normal) and a Holter monitor which was given last week (no results yet). 

The person I'm currently seeing F30 and I haven't made things official yet as she's going to Asia for 6 months, which is a whole other story. She isn't currently dating anyone but has said that even if we become official I might have ""needs"" I could meet while she's gone, so I didn't feel bad (at first) asking F24 to meet for coffee. Sitting there it felt like we'd never ended things. We joked around, wandered the neighboring CVS and I drove her back to her car. We sat there for a while and I gave her a piece of the pie I'd made for Thanksgiving. She then took the pie and held it up to my face, I took a bite, she set it down, and then we kissed for a while.

Afterwards I told her my feelings are still the same about getting back together knowing it would never work, which she agreed with and said she never intended to start up again. But my emotions snowballed over the following week and with my roommate's blessing I invited her over for a movie and sent her an Instagram follow request (I had unfollowed her literally a day prior to her reaching out again). She replied that she didn't think it was a good idea to ""mix things"" and I told her I was being dumb and apologized. Conversation normalized again but hasn't been the same since. It actually died out a bit after Thanksgiving and only sporadically have I talked to her about her health. 

Today I find out she denied the Instagram request, which all things considered is such a stupid reason to make this incredibly long post. It's definitely more than that, but I feel used and tossed aside. I've never felt this kind of a connection, ever. I would move to another country just to be with her. I didn't even consider children until I met her. I only started to have slightly similar feelings for the woman I'm with now but I know it will never be the same. If I can move past the first girl maybe it's possible? But I don't know how that's humanly possible and don't think I want to. This is the only instant in my life where I've felt entirely broken.

With finals season approaching I can't afford to spend hours thinking about her or drafting up more Reddit posts for guidance. 
This story is VERY specific, but for the men here, how did you move past a person you knew you could have spent your entire life with?",1,1733777754.0,AskMenOver30,8,0.6,False
1hak5ck,https://www.reddit.com/r/Quittingfeelfree/comments/1hak5ck/how_i_became_addicted_to_feel_free_and_how_i/,How I became addicted to Feel Free and how I kicked it last week,"I wanted to share my story for everyone coming here to give hope, optimism, and some very important warnings. For context…I’m a 49-year-old male. I own a company in the healthcare business and my wife is a nutritionist. I am a generally very healthy person.

Last March 2024 I dropped my daughter off at college and had a 3-hour drive ahead of me. I stopped at a gas station to get some water and noticed these Feel Free bottles on the counter at checkout. I remember it so well still. I asked the guy working what it was, and he said it was an energy drink and make sure you shake it well before you drink it (not his fault BTW). I barely looked at the bottle assuming there was nothing harmful about it as it is being sold at an Amoco. I drank the whole thing and threw it away. About 15 minutes into my drive, I started feeling great! Like nothing I had ever experienced but not over the top at all.

I sort of forgot about it for the next few months until one day I walked into a local “health and wellness” smoothie and food shop around the corner from my office (irony obvious) and there they were on the counter. I bought 2 of them and had them that day. I’m sure everyone knows how this went from there, so I won’t bore you with the details, but the usage just ramped up every day from there until I was consuming 4-6 per day and some days as much as 9. The poison began to completely take over my life in every way.

I had a business trip to Europe planned in October and I didn’t want to bring them with me, so I tried to quit. I remember the moment very well while I was driving home from my office and the sensation came over me and I thought “Holy shit! I am completely addicted to this stuff”. I decided I needed to buy a bunch to put in my checked luggage to bring with me. By this point I had already purchased the pills from the website to supplement me in times when I couldn’t drink the bottles. So, I had those on the airplane in my carry-on for the flights there and back. Sidenote, the pills were helpful but not nearly the same as the liquid.

I finally decided to quit after I had a terrible Thanksgiving Day (my favorite holiday). I also decided I needed to tell my wife about what was going on. I was so sick of hiding it from her and, quite honestly, I knew I needed her help. I was so worried about her being disappointed and angry at me and I was definitely terrified of going through the detox. We had a full week of social engagements, and I had a lot happening at work so my plan was to wait until Saturday morning to tell her and start then.

On Tuesday night Dec 3rd I couldn’t take it anymore and just opened up to her. She was very understanding but extremely scared. As a highly educated nutritionist she has a deep understanding of how things impact our health. I have lost about 15% of my body weight in the last 6 months and upon a brief dig into what this stuff actually is, she was totally freaked out! I still wanted to wait until Saturday to stop but her opinion was that this is poison and should absolutely never go into your body again. So, I quit that night, and I was terrified.

A note up front, as I went through this process I monitored my blood pressure, heart rate, and body temp obsessively. Everything remained very normal but I was willing to go to the hospital if anything changed significantly. I highly suggest everyone do the same.

Day 1 – Wednesday 12/4 - I woke up with a lot of anxiety and already withdrawing. I had been taking a bottle immediately when I woke up each day so I knew it would be rough. By mid-morning though I was feeling OK. I took Vitamin C and Magnesium and went for a 30-minute walk on a tread mill. Movement has helped me a lot throughout this. I highly recommend taking a slow walk as much as you can even though you don’t feel like it. I truly  already started feeling hopeful. By late afternoon, however, I felt terrible. Like I had an awful flu but a little different. I went back and forth between Tylenol and Motrin and just suffered through it. I also made sure to drink a ton of water with liquid IV in it throughout. Sleep was nearly impossible that night, but I ended up getting about 4 hours in. I barely ate anything all day. I also took 3 showers throughout the day that seemed to help.

Day 2 – Thursday 12/5 - I woke up feeling euphoric. I had coffee and a protein smoothie that tasted like God had made it then showered and went for a 20 minute walk on the treadmill. I hung low on the couch the rest of the day watching movies and hydrating. Still on the Tylenol and Motrin regimen. I also took the supplements again and now added Black Seed Oil and Magnesium. Around 6pm I started feeling lousy again but not as bad as the day before. I ate more on day 2 but still much less than a normal day for me. Sleep was still very challenging. Another 4.5 hours of tossing and turning. The sleep problem is strange. I had a lot of joint pain and general discomfort. It was so hard to find a comfortable position and stay in it. I’m a very easy sleeper usually so this was super challenging for me.

Day 3 – Friday 12/6 – This was the real turning point day. I continued with supplements and significantly reduced the Tylenol and Motrin regimen. I didn’t feel totally great but ran some errands, did some more walking on the treadmill, stopped in to my office for an hour to catch up a bit, and made it to my son’s senior year pre-holiday dance pictures….this made me very happy as I was worried I was going to miss it.

By Saturday I was almost completely back. The weekend was great. Dinner and a movie with my wife and really didn’t miss a beat with everything I wanted to do. Also, my appetite came back stronger than ever and I ate more on Sunday than I had in months.

As I type this from my office Monday morning, I have more gratitude than perhaps I have ever had. I still have some joint pain and I’m still not sleeping great but I am totally free from the addiction. I have mild diarrhea which, and I know this sounds odd, is almost welcomed because I was so terribly constipated while I was using this stuff. I have no desire to ever touch that poison again and I am SO happy that I made the decision to shut it down when I did.

My suggestion to everyone is to quickly put a plan in place and STOP IMMEDIATELY! You will have a rough couple of days but I promise you it will be 100% worth it. I won’t to go into what we have identified as the potential significant health risks to this product, but I assure you there are many and they are very scary. I will be having blood work done later this week to see how much damage has been done so I am still keeping my fingers crossed.

I have also read many people on this thread discussing the depression and anxiety they had while coming off this. I want to say that other than that first morning and the initial terror of knowing the detox would be difficult, I experienced practically none of that. I have been mostly ecstatic that I am kicking this, and I have the rest of my life to look forward to without it! That being said, I will be praying for those of you that are experiencing those mental side effects. I know they are very real and I hope your journey results in as positive of a mental state as I feel right now.

As a side note, I am looking into the current class action lawsuit against this product initiated by Arms Davis Law. I don’t intend to get involved but I will be following in hopes that they will have success. I was thinking about using my resources to initiate one, but it seems like they are well on their way. This stuff should and will be pulled from the market in due time. I also have no doubt that the company will suffer significant financial penalties.

So, just to summarize, this is one of the most challenging things I have ever been through in my life. And, in the words of my wife the night I told her “This is not your fault. You bought something at a gas station and had no idea how addictive it was”. Everyone please understand that THIS IS NOT YOUR FAULT! This company knows exactly what they are doing and what this product is so take your power back immediately and go through the process!! You will make it, and it will absolutely be worth it.

Happy to answer any questions anyone may have on this thread if necessary.

With Gratitude and Love,

A former Feel Free POISON addict

I'm the lucky prize recipient of a 739ml Yeti Rambler, but I would like to use it for hot coffee on my commute and it came with a straw lid. It looks like the Stronghold lid is not compatible with this tumbler, and the Magslide lid explicitly states it ""is not leakproof and will not prevent spills"". It seems like a silly question to have to ask when it comes to such a premium product, but is there an alternative option that won't leak on me if I keep it upright while coffee sloshes around inside?

1hak3e5,https://www.reddit.com/r/marriageadvice/comments/1hak3e5/my_husbands_our_marriage_is_hurting/,My husbands & our marriage is hurting. ,"We both are in recovery. I have four years clean. He has six years clean. We’re both recovering from heroin and meth . It’s a very long story but put it this way. I am no longer the same person. I was back then when I did those drugs for two years, I had lost a baby to a miscarriage. It killed me so for two years I was very destructive and just didn’t care. On the other hand, my husband had a longer history with drugs, but we’ve known each other since we were kids.besides the point. I’m not really good about writing so sorry about that so fast-forward it probably been a while now like maybe six months my husband‘s smoking weed, but in vape form.no other way. But how I found out it wasn’t by him admitting to it or being open and honest it was me asking for months . Before admitting that he was doing it for a few months already that right there already made me feel some type of way. It’s like I thought we had an open communication. I like to also add that we have a now 21 month old daughter a seven-year-old middle child and an older child 13 yr old daughter that  is biologically mine. That he loves dearly as his own we have been married since 2017. There’s just a little backstory anyways. I don’t know what’s going on, but the past few weeks have been getting really really rough. Do I agree with him smoking absolutely not because he has to lie to middle child that he’s just vaping as in like smoking cigarettes! My older daughter that comes for Christmas break and summer breaks possibly coming for the whole school year next year anyway anyways she’s unaware of any of this! Anyways, so back to what I’m trying to say, though my husband, his mood swings are crazy. He’s starting to not act like himself and he’s so unpredictable and makes me very uncomfortable. Anything sent him off. It’s driving a wedge between me and him. Last night I finally wrote a text to his mom, and she agrees that she never liked this idea in the first place of him smoking weed he would never agree that it was the weed. He doesn’t smoke during work or whatever but as soon as he gets home, he smokes. I feel like it’s just placing so much animosity in the air my son last night said mommy daddy just keeps snapping one minute. He’s happy and then I go out there and it’s like he’s a different person that breaks my heart. I don’t even know how to bring this up to him because before I was like I think it’s the weed that’s changing you. He blows up on me. I definitely don’t want to bring this conversation up in front of the children because it is not fair and I don’t want an argument in front of the kids. I’m all about protecting my children. None of my children have seen me in active addiction and that’s a different story for another time, but I came on this app not for the negativity but for somewhere to vent it’s one of my days off and I’m trying to sit here and have a warm cup of coffee and just try to reach out for advice. I do apologize in advance for my grammar. Please help.

TL;DR husband is smoking weed. It’s changing our relationship. I just want my old husband back.

1hak285,https://www.reddit.com/r/HustleAndFaith/comments/1hak285/virtual_assistant_services/,Virtual Assistant Services,"Alright, let’s dive into the world of virtual assistance—the unsung heroes behind the scenes, tirelessly juggling tasks while sipping their fourth cup of coffee (or is it just me?). Whether you’re a whiz at scheduling or have mastered the art of email management without losing your mind, there’s a treasure trove of opportunities out there waiting to be snagged.

**Tasks a VA Can Perform:**

1. **Scheduling**: Imagine handling someone’s calendar like it’s a work of art, fitting appointments, meetings, and the occasional lunch with a much-needed side of virtual therapy (also known as coffee breaks). You’re the maestro conducting a symphony of schedules, ensuring every note is hit exactly on time.

2. **Email Management**: Oh boy, the flood of emails can feel like trying to empty the ocean with a spoon. But fear not! As a VA, you're the skilled lifesaver diving in to organize, respond, and filter out the spam, transforming chaos into calm, one inbox at a time.

3. **Social Media Management**: If you know the difference between TikTok and a before-and-after of a TikTok dance challenge, you’re all set. Promoting someone’s brand online while dodging the urge to scroll endlessly can be a challenge, but with the right strategy, it’s a win-win.

4. **Data Entry**: You know how a magician pulls rabbits out of hats? A good VA can pull insights out of spreadsheets, keeping everything orderly and accessible. Excel might not be magic, but it can definitely feel like it when you’ve got a pro on the job.

5. **Research**: Need to know the best vegan pizza joint in town or what the latest trends in remote work are? VAs thrive on digging up information faster than a dog chasing its tail!

**Finding Clients on Platforms Like Fiverr:**

Now, let’s shine a spotlight on Fiverr—think of it as the bustling marketplace where you set up shop, showcasing your skills like a proud peacock strutting its stuff. Here’s how to climb the Fiverr ladder:

1. **Create an Eye-Catching Profile**: Your profile should scream ‘hire me!’ (but in a friendly, approachable way). Use a clear, professional photo and craft a bio that captures your essence, sprinkled with a dash of humor. 

2. **Service Offerings**: Clearly outline what you do (and don’t do). Create distinct gig listings for each service, complete with enticing titles and descriptions that’ll make clients feel they’ve just struck gold.

3. **Showcase Reviews**: If you have testimonials or have worked in the field before, flaunt those reviews like a badge of honor. Positive feedback is worth its weight in virtual gold.

4. **Build a Portfolio**: Include samples of your work. If you’ve transformed an outlook calendar into a zen garden of organization or crafted email templates that people rave about, show it off!

**Marketing Your Skills:**

So now comes the daunting task of marketing yourself. Don’t worry; even superstars have their humble beginnings. Here are some strategies to get your name out there:

1. **Social Networks**: Leverage platforms like LinkedIn and Facebook groups. Share your journey, insights on virtual assistance, or tips on effective scheduling. Remember, every single post could resonate with someone hunting for a VA.

2. **Networking**: Never underestimate the power of connecting with folks. Find local meetups or virtual conferences where you can meet other professionals. Share a laugh and a story or two—because who doesn’t appreciate someone who combines business with a bit of personality?

3. **Blogging or Vlogging**: If you enjoy the written word or have a penchant for video, start a blog or a YouTube channel where you can share tips and tricks about being a VA. This not only builds credibility but draws potential clients to you like a moth to a flame.

4. **Referral Programs**: Implement a referral program where happy clients can get discounts if they refer others. This not only helps you but also creates a community feeling where everyone’s helping each other out.

In the end, remember that being a virtual assistant is about more than just tasks; it's about making lives easier, one email at a time. With a sprinkle of humor, a pinch of hard work, and a dash of faith in your abilities, you’ll be thriving in no time.

1hajzzv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1hajzzv,How my mom left my coffee pot.,"Bit of a backstory here.. My mom came over to watch our apartment when mine and my husband’s friend died because we had to fly out of state and we have cats. (no one else could.)

We kinda were doing her a favor cause she is basically homeless. All she had to do was take care of my cats and she would be fed and be somewhere with electricity. The only downside is when it came time for her to leave she refused. ANYWAYS..

We came back and I mentioned that my coffee pot was full of mold (in the coffee) and she said she would clean it up. Weeks passed and she never did. I’m pregnant and so I told her AGAIN instead of doing it myself and of course she didn’t. 

Well we finally got her to leave a couple days ago and I had been cleaning my kitchen and saw the moldy coffee pot. I decided to clean that and I didn’t even expect to find this when I opened the filter spot. A bunch of Gnats flew out and the smell is god awful. So yeah..

1hajzvj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1hajzvj/aita_for_telling_my_sons_stepdad_that_hes/,AITA for telling my son's stepdad that he's not/never will be a father to him and starting a screaming fight?,"Throwaway, fake names

I (31M) have split custody of my son, Marcus (12M) with my ex, Lena (30F). Lena and I split up shortly after he was born, and stayed friends, but have been less communicative since she married Erik (42M) four years ago. We have had disagreements–I don't approve of certain things they've been doing and they think I spoil him–but until recently we managed to keep things civil.

Marcus is a great kid and I love him. He's smart, funny, and caring, and he's taught me so much about being a human. Having him saved my life and changed it for the better. He's also more or less my only family, so I really treasure him and our time together. Recently he's gotten chubby and depressed, which I only mention because it's relevant.

I was concerned over my son gaining weight but I didn't want to do much other than making sure we eat healthy. He's still active in sports, which I encourage, and a lot will change with puberty. His mom and stepdad are upset though, and I now know that they had Marcus on a restricted diet and are putting a lot of pressure on him to lose weight. At first it didn't seem like much but it became more unreasonable e.g. before this incident, I got in trouble with Erik for buying Marcus a size up in clothes, since he thought that he should trim down to fit his old ones better. I told him that I wasn't going to apologise for giving my son pants, he never responded. 

Last week, when I came to pick him up, Marcus was still packing his bag. Lena invited me inside for coffee and we were making small talk when I heard shouting. Apparently Marcus had been hiding snacks in his room. Erik found candy bars in his overnight bag (which they no longer allow in the house), and pulled them out to show to us as evidence. I got upset when he called Marcus names and told him he ""wouldn't be fat if he weren't so greedy"", and told him to treat my son with respect.

Marcus went to the car, and things devolved. I said the thing in the title, called him a bully, and a lot of expletives got thrown around. I didn't hear from Lena until later when she texted to tell me that she was furious with me. I was still reeling from everything so the conversation is a blur. I tried to tell her I was sorry, but that I couldn't understand why she would allow him to treat Marcus that way. She told me that while was ""a bit much"", Marcus broke their rules and Erik was right that he should lose weight. She also told me that I don't know anything about the ""disrespect"" Marcus gives them, that I only experience the ""fun parts of being a parent"", and accused me of encouraging bad behaviour that she has to deal with. 

I had a talk with Marcus and told him I love him and he has nothing to be ashamed of. He seems better, but I'm not looking forward to taking him back to his mom's home. I know I made things worse and I should have removed myself from the situation, but I wouldn't feel right if I didn't at least stand up for my son. AITA?",42,1733777365.0,AmItheAsshole,35,0.98,False
1hajzgt,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1hajzgt/the_power_keeps_going_out_in_my_office/,The power keeps going out in my office,"I want to start by saying I hadn’t worked in over three months. So, when this place called me back, I was more than eager to dive right in. I would have taken any job, but this one seemed easy enough. I’ve had a lot of jobs over the years—something about 'adult ADHD,' or whatever the doctor called it—this one isn't so bad but recently some pretty weird things have been happening.

The Job itself is easy: facilities maintenance for an office supply company. I actually don’t even really know what they do here. If I’m being honest, I’m not even sure the workers know either. They *say* they sell printers and paper and things, but I don’t actually ever see that happening. They *say* they love their job! But weirdly enough, no one ever really talks to each other, so the place is often quiet and typically smells like stale coffee and whatever old air-freshener they overuse in the lobby.

It’s a boring job. Well, the *office* is boring, my job is actually kind of interesting. This place was built in the 60’s or 70’s I think and so most of the systems are out-of-date and something always seems to be breaking. My boss, Earl, says he knows everything there is to know about this place and that most of it runs off hopes and a good prayer which is good because I know nothing about maintenance.

Earl is… interesting. A 70’s something grizzled old veteran with no sense of humor; at least not one I get. He’s got a massive beer gut, smells faintly of liquor and always has a half-smoked cigarette hanging from his lips no matter how much the HR lady seems to bark at him for it.

Normally, things around here aren’t too hard to fix. Leaky faucets, buzzing lights, that one toilet that always clogs, things like that. But, for the past few weeks, for reasons we don’t know, the power has been going out. At first, it would just blink, a few flickers and then we were back in business, but recently it’s been getting worse. Last Friday It went out for over 15 minutes! Every time it goes out Earl tells me to just wait around and that he’ll be back. He apparently likes to tackle new projects by himself. Says it helps him “really get the lay of the land.” Whatever the hell that means. It’s starting to become an odd routine. Power goes out, “Stay here.” Earl goes into the basement. The power comes back on.

It really doesn’t bother me that Earl doesn’t want my help, in fact, I typically just go into the break room and eat a snack or slink back to the maintenance “office” which just happens to be a big closet full of random tools and other junk.  Yesterday the power went out for about 12 minutes and when Earl returned, he had a nasty cut across the back of his hand and was consequently leaving a trail of blood wherever he walked. I grabbed him a kitchen towel from the breakroom and asked him if he was ok to which he grumbled, “Ah, this is nothing.” For what it’s worth, I could have guessed he would say that. It may come as no surprise, but Earl is a man of few words, so few words in fact, that even after 6 months I still don’t know much about the guy. I know that he’s great at being grumpy in between telling me to hand him a vaguely described tool and that he did his “duty,” which I’m assuming is war related, but other than that he’s still a stranger.

I was starting to get used to the routine when something weird happened. Earlier today the lights started their now-familiar song and dance, then as if on cue, cut out entirely. Earl looked up from his newspaper, got up, and headed for the basement. I asked him if he needed any help this time but, as always, he had it under control. I was busy eyeing the useless vending machine’s bountiful selection of old potato chips and peanut butter crackers when all at once, without warning, a piercing scream ripped through the stillness, coming from the basement. I jumped out of my skin and rushed to the basement stairs only to see Earl wiping away sweat from his forehead with the same dirty rag he uses for everything. He was sporting yet another battle wound except this one was across his face and, now that I think about it, it resembled a set of scratches, really. I asked him what the hell happened, and he shrugged it off. Something about the boilers overheating? Earl brushed past me and headed for the restroom. I asked him what we should do about the power which seemed to remind him of our predicament. Before Earl had the chance to response the light came back on.

Earl actually ended up leaving early today. He said he wasn’t feeling too well and just wanted to lay down. In the time I’ve been here Earl hasn’t ever left early, hell, he’s never even taken a day off. But I figured Earl *is* pretty old and this whole power issue has seemed to be kicking his ass. The last few hours of the day went fine. I was in the middle of making a paperclip chain when I stopped to think. Why *did* earl have those scratches on his face? Why did they look like scratches and what the hell was that awful scream. I didn’t even know the building had a boiler system? What even is a boiler system? I had too many questions, so I decided to just go check it out myself. Surprisingly, Earl had locked the basement and none of the keys I had seemed to fit the lock. I went to ask the HR lady, Brenda, if she happened to have an extra key, but she seemed too scatter-brained to understand what I was asking and so I left and went back to the closet.

I’ve decided to keep a record of everything weird that’s been happening. I’m writing this from a dusty-old desktop that has been in the corner of this closet since who knows when. I was surprised it even turned on. Tomorrow I’m going to ask Earl if we can *both* take a look at the electrical system. I’m dying to figure out what’s going on.. and maybe understand why Earl has been acting so weird. I’ll update this record as soon as I know more. Bye for now.

Today i ate 6 eggs and 1 liter of milk and 500 ml coffee for breakfast. 
I went to school, was at school, and came home from school. When i got home from school i took a lookie in the fridge and saw nothing but a variety of sauces, such as ketchup, salsa & mustard. The type of stuff in the fridge that is past the expiriation date. I was a hungry boi and desperate for food, and all there was left were 3 16-pack eggs. So i fried another 5 eggs. Roundabout 3 hours later i fried another 6 eggs. Sofar i’ve consumed 17 eggs today, and it’s to the point where im conserned for my safety. I wonder how much cholesterol is flowing thru my veins. 

Here i am, writing this on r/eggs. Hungry. Hesitant to frying another 6 eggs. That’ll add the total to 23 eggs today. Ive eaten nothing but eggs, other than 1 liter of milk and coffee.

I've made this list so that when it's finally gaming week for me to use my [RP3+](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZhpagUgIHI) again, I'll just pick a game based on a specific criteria.  


I will **not** be updating that list because... there's over **300** games. There's more than enough for me to spend time doing, just thought I shared what I've edited into the last 2 days of thoughts when searching this subreddit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Teeth whitening has become increasingly popular among individuals seeking a confident, brighter smile. If you’ve been considering this cosmetic procedure, understanding the transformative effects—before and after results—can help you make an informed decision. Many people experience not just a change in color but also a boost in self-esteem.

Before diving into the specifics, let’s explore what teeth whitening entails. There are various options available, ranging from professional treatment at the dentist's office to over-the-counter products. Each option has its pros and cons, and understanding them can greatly influence your choice.

### Types of Teeth Whitening Options

- **In-Office Treatments:** A dentist uses special products, which often contain higher concentrations of bleaching agents. This method offers quick results, usually within one session.
- **At-Home Kits:** Many dentists offer personalized take-home kits. These include custom-fitted trays and whitening gel. It may take longer to see results, typically a few weeks, but it can be more convenient.
- **Over-the-Counter Products:** These include whitening strips, toothpaste, or gels that you can purchase in stores. While they may be less expensive, results can vary greatly.
- **Natural Remedies:** Some people opt for baking soda, hydrogen peroxide, or activated charcoal as natural whitening agents. However, results are often subtle and less predictable.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the options available, let’s examine the typical before and after results experienced by many individuals. Whichever method you choose, the goal is to achieve a smile that reflects your personality and boosts your confidence.

### Before Whitening: The Common Concerns

Before undergoing teeth whitening, many individuals express certain concerns, such as:

1. **Staining:** Natural wear and tear, consumption of certain foods or beverages like coffee and red wine, and habits like smoking can lead to discoloration.
2. **Self-Confidence:** Many people feel embarrassed about stained teeth, affecting social interactions and self-esteem.
3. **Cost:** Some are hesitant about the price tag on professional treatments, opting instead for at-home options that may not yield significant results.

These concerns can create a cycle of frustration, leading you to seek an effective solution that gives you a stunning smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### After Whitening: The Transformative Effects

The results after teeth whitening are often astonishing. Many people report a range of improvements, including:

1. **Brighter Smile:** Most noticeable is the degree of whiteness achieved, which can range from several shades lighter to dramatically brighter.
2. **Increased Confidence:** A brighter smile can lead to a more positive outlook on life, making you feel more open and approachable.
3. **Enhanced Aesthetics:** A whiter smile enhances your facial features, drawing attention to your smile in a positive way.
4. **Improved Oral Hygiene Habits:** After a whitening treatment, many individuals become more mindful about their oral care, leading to healthier habits long-term.

Before and after photos are often shared on social media, showcasing the dramatic contrast between the two states. Seeing these transformations can serve as motivation for those considering teeth whitening.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Factors Influencing Results

Not all results will be the same. Several factors influence how someone’s teeth will respond to whitening, such as:

- **Initial Shade:** Naturally darker or more stained teeth may achieve different results than slightly discolored teeth.
- **Age:** Younger individuals may see more significant improvements compared to older adults.
- **Dental Health:** Individuals with proper oral hygiene and health typically experience better results.
- **Method Chosen:** As highlighted earlier, the whitening method plays a significant role in the result.

Ultimately, the decision to whiten your teeth should be based on your personal goals and expectations. Understanding the transformative effects and potential before and after outcomes can assist you in achieving the smile you’ve always wanted. As you embark on this journey, remember that the emotional boost can be as significant as the physical change.

Understanding the Different Teeth Whitening Methods and Their Outcomes
----------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to achieving a brighter smile, many people turn to teeth whitening methods. Understanding the different options available can help you choose the solution that fits your lifestyle and budget. You can achieve great results, but knowing what to expect before and after is vital for making an informed decision.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Professional Teeth Whitening

One of the most effective ways to whiten your teeth is through professional treatments offered by dentists. These treatments often use higher concentrations of whitening agents compared to over-the-counter products.

- **In-Office Whitening:** This method involves applying a powerful whitening gel to your teeth and using a special light to enhance its effects. The process typically lasts about one hour and can result in several shades of white immediately.
- **Take-Home Kits:** Your dentist may provide you with custom trays and a professional-grade whitening gel to use at home. This method can take longer, requiring about a week or two of regular use, but it can lead to significant improvements.

### Over-the-Counter Options

If you prefer a more budget-friendly option, over-the-counter teeth whitening products are widely available. These include whitening strips, gels, and toothpaste.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Whitening Strips:** These adhesive strips are coated with a whitening gel and are applied to the teeth for a specified duration, often 30 minutes to an hour. Results may be visible after a few days.
- **Whitening Toothpaste:** Most whitening toothpaste contains mild abrasives and chemical agents that can help remove surface stains. While this method is the least invasive, it may take longer to see a noticeable change.

### Natural Remedies

For those interested in natural solutions, several home remedies may produce gradual results. While they might not be as effective as professional treatments, they can be a gentler alternative.

- **Baking Soda:** This common kitchen ingredient is known for its mild abrasive properties. Brushing with a paste made from baking soda and water can help lift surface stains over time.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** Diluted hydrogen peroxide can act as a bleaching agent. Swishing it in your mouth before brushing may offer some whitening benefits.
- **Activated Charcoal:** Though still a topic of debate among dental professionals, some people use activated charcoal in their oral care routines, believing it can absorb stains.

### What to Expect Before and After Whitening

Before starting any teeth whitening method, it's essential to consult with your dentist. They can help determine the best approach for your dental health and specific needs. Additionally, consider the following:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Pre-Whitening Preparation:** Maintaining good oral hygiene is crucial. Brush and floss your teeth regularly, and consider getting a professional cleaning before your whitening treatment.
- **Post-Whitening Care:** After whitening, your teeth may be more sensitive. Avoid hot or cold foods and beverages immediately after treatment. It’s also wise to refrain from consuming staining foods and drinks, like coffee and red wine, for at least 24 to 48 hours.

### Results and Maintenance

The results of teeth whitening can vary based on the method used and individual factors. Professional treatments may yield immediate results, whereas over-the-counter options might take longer. Here's what to keep in mind:

- **Longevity of Results:** Generally, results from professional whitening can last anywhere from six months to up to two years, depending on your lifestyle and habits. Over-the-counter methods may require more frequent touch-ups.
- **Touch-Up Treatments:** To maintain your bright smile, consider periodic touch-up treatments every few months, especially if you consume staining substances like coffee or tobacco.

Achieving a whiter smile involves exploring various teeth whitening methods and understanding their outcomes. From professional treatments to at-home remedies, each approach has its pros and cons. By weighing these options and maintaining proper dental care, you can enjoy a brighter smile that boosts your confidence.

### Conclusion

The journey of teeth whitening can lead to remarkable transformations in both appearance and confidence. Many individuals experience a significant boost in their self-esteem, largely due to the stunning results achieved through various whitening methods. Whether it's an in-office treatment or an at-home kit, the “before and after” results often speak volumes. Those who opted for professional treatments frequently report dramatic changes, with their smiles becoming several shades whiter in just one visit. Meanwhile, home whitening kits offer a more gradual yet effective approach, appealing to those who prefer a more flexible routine.

1hajvl1,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1hajvl1/day_6/,Day 6,"I'm on day 6 and wanted to share my experience.

**USAGE**

I've been on caffeine for about 15 years with coffee and energy drinks.  I think the average for me was somewhere in the 300-600mgs per day range.  All before 10am.  Also a lot of diet coke as well.

**REASONS FOR QUITTING**

* Energy crash in the afternoons/evenings
* Anxiety
* Terrible sleep

Sleep is the new youth drug and I don't really get much beyond 5.5hrs per night and I really need like 7.  But even if I get 7, I don't get the hours of deep rem sleep I need to really feel rested/rejuvinated.  

To improve my sleep, I've been taking prescribed sleep medicine but even with that I don't get the hours or the quality I really need.  

I've tried to quit before and always get back on the sauce.  This is the longest I think I have gone.

**EXPERIENCE**

Day 1 -  Unspeakable.  Headaches, brain fog but honestly, I felt really sick

Day 2 - Not much better and my sleep was terrible that first night

Day 3 - Headaches were abating but the brain fog was real and a bit of a depression coupled with low energy

Day 4 - Got the best sleep both in terms of volume 7.5hrs and quality 3hrs deep sleep.  Slept like a kid and feel it in my body being rested.  That kind of rested where you get up and wonder what decade it is.  Vivid dreams too which I never have.  But still foggy, lack of energy and motivation.  

Day 5 - Great sleep again.  Most of the fog gone but still there.  The big thing is energy.  I don't have the 3pm crash but I'm operating at a lower baseline throughout the day.  My wife says she doesn't like my personality when I'm this low energy/foggy.  Lol!

Day 6 - Today.  Again, another very restful night.  I forgot to mention that I fall asleep faster rather than my mind spinning.  Today I woke up with more energy and focus.  I'd say I'm probably 75% of what I have been on caffeine in terms of energy and just being mentally quick.  I feel a lot better.

**ENERGY REMEDIES/SUBSTITUTES**

* I'd like to exercise and have that be what gets me going.  But it's hard to get the energy/motivation to really do that so far.  I'm walking but find myself resistant to hardcore exercise that I did when I was on caffeine.
* I'm drinking ice water in the mornings.  Doesn't really help but doing it just the same.
* I tried drinking some ashwaganda tea with some other various mushrooms in it.  Zero help in terms of mental clarity or energy.

**QUESTIONS**

1. Does anyone else have any other suggestions for getting energy up in the morning?
2. Any other suggestions for the mental clarity/quickness aspect of this?
3. Are there people who keep the benefits of no caffeine if they just have it 1 time per week, say on a weekend but don't consume it any other time?

Looking for coffee recs for water process decaf specifically.

Also hoping that it's relatively affordable.  I would order Brandywine but I don't need a bag of caffeinated coffee rn but I do need decaf. Price is too much after shipping - Needs to ship to usa relatively cheaply as a single bag as well. 


Bonus questions in place of making a second thread.  How do you all mitigate the super quick staling of decaf? I cant make decent espresso from any decaf after maybe a week or two.

# Guardian:

\-Galacta-cactus: Warranted

\-Gardening Gloves: What? Why?

\-Photosynthesizer: THANK GOD FINALLY

\-Tricarrotops: Again, THANK GOD

\-Marine Bean: ok

\-Primal Wall-nut: ok

\-Spikeweed Sector: Wha-? WHY?! What made you think that this environment was ""too good?"" Good it was, but not ""too good.""

\-Mirror-nut: idk man idrc tbh it feels like an average balance change idrk how I feel about it

\-Prickly Pear: Again, why? Like it's not bad bad, it's just bad in most situations, just like it was before. If tricks like rolling stone weren't a thing this'd be better for sure, but rn I don't think this is it. It doesn't really change much.

\-Smackadamia: ok

\-Tough Beets: ok

\-Gravitree: As someone who never uses it I feel like it definitely makes it a better control card, but tbh who controls this late in the game? I don't really know, man, but I like this change.

# Kabloom:

\-Hot Lava: looks good

\-Blooming Heart: As a person that doesn't play with aggro solar flare much I like this change, but I can see why some people may not be a fan of it.

\-Puff-shroom: Literally WHY?! IN WHAT WORLD WOULD THIS MAKE SENSE? This is so stupid.

\-Invasive Species: ok

\-Seedling: seedling op 🙏

\-Wild Berry: This seems pretty insignificant but idk maybe I'll end up hating it later idrk

\-Sizzle: Sizzle being an actually playable card? No way!!1one!1

\-Velociradish Hunter: Literally who cares?

\-Zapricot: Very much deserved fr fr Zapricot was clearly way too op as a 4/2 3-cost. Obviously an overstat, needed nerf.

\-Transfiguration reworked: On one hand I like this new ability, on the other o7 to the old one. It was fun. Sad that they could just, idk, say, MAKE NEW CARDS to implement these ideas. I digress.

\-Atomic Bombegranite: In Seedling We Trust

\-Poison Oak: ok

# Mega-Grow:

Banana Class Rework: On one had I liked the small banana class. It was a cool class with overall pretty decent cards. Now it being mixed with fruits feels a lot more generic and with half-banana as a 2-cost (which makes sense, but still o7 1 cost half-banana), the cards being fruit-class feels off. I do not like this change too much, but then again, I might end up being completely long later on.

Banana Peel: As a 1-cost card that used to draw pretty decent cards, overall, it was pretty good. As a 2-cost card that can draw a bunch of garbage, it's mid and imo not really worth it anymore.

Black Eyed Pea: Very much deserved

Half Banana: o7 old peel I liked you, for some reason.

Podfather: idk how I feel about this but tbh idrc for now

Typical Beanstalk: Literally who asked for this?

Cosmic Pea: WHY?? JUST WHY?

Potted Powerhouse: ok

Whipvine: ok

Bamboozle: ok

Super Phat Beets: ok

# Smarty:

\-Laser cattail: Laser Cattail my beloved <3

\-Lightning Reed: Now it's not terrible anymore, it's just mid!

\-Mayflower: I didn't think Mayflower needed a buff but tbh I'm not complaining too much

\-Bean Counter: It was already a mid card. WHY?!

\-Carrotillery: Makes sense

\-Leaf Blower: Oh this will be very annoying in the 1% situations in which you'll actually find someone running Leaf Blower. But then again, more people might start running it because of this change. Idrk.

\-Navy Bean: ok

\-Snapdragon: ok

\-Melon-pult: ok

\-Winter-melon: ok

# Solar:

\-Haunted Pumpking: Perfect change, love it

\-Apple Saucer: Now worst case scenario it's just a pretty useless card that dies to basically anything and best case scenario it's 6 damage to your opponent's face whilst not doing much otherwise. Meh.

\-Water Balloons: Water Balloons actually playable?! Wtf?!

\-Sunstrike (Cross Pollination): This convinces me that a random employee at PopCap had a few ideas for cards and just went like ""What if I just replaced the ability of some of the cards that people don't really talk about with these new ideas and see what happens!"" Odd change that makes the card less useful tbh.

\-Magnifying Grass: I don't think people really run magnifying grass and complain that it has too little HP, because that's not really the point of the card, but then again, I guess it survives Acid Rain and Fireworks Zombie. Yipee?

\-Venus Flytrap: Solar Class did not need more healing but I digress

\-Elderberry: Fair, I guess

\-Cob Cannon: Deserved

\-Laser Bean reworked: Isn't it just better now? Am I stupid? Although I guess it wasn't good initially, and now it's playable sometimes, so idk man.

# Heroes:

\-More Spore: Awesome sauce

\-GK Signature: Literally why?

\-SF signature: Now it causes a lot of issues. It can be Sunburn > Twin Sunflower or Sunburn > literally any aggro card(s) just on turn 1, so it's pretty broken now, me thinks.

\-Ensign Uproot (BC super): ok

\-BC Signature (Genetic Amplification): ok

# Zombies:

# Beastly:

\-Cat Lady: ok I guess, now it doesn't die to.. Pumpking anymore? Or I guess plants with two attack if it's played on 1? I don't know man, sure.

\-Nibble: Idk what I think about this. It's kind of fine I think..

\-Yeti Lunchbox: Pet synergy was already good enough w/ lunchbox

\-Synchronized swimmer: NOOOOOOOO IT'S LITERALLY UNPLAYABLE NOW!! REVERT UPDATE WTF POPCAP?!!

\-Zookeeper: Meh, okay

\-Alien Ooze: Alien Ooze was already good enough I think. It did not need a buff.

\-B-flat: Still pretty useless

\-Kangaroo Rider: Sure?

\-Overstuffed Zombie: I preferred the old version. If the opponent did not have removal, it would just grow constantly, and if combined with a Going Viral it could really cause some issues. Not a good card per se, but it was fun. Now it's just kind of there, fulfilling a whole different purpose. Sure, I guess?

\-Primordial Cheese Shover: ok

\-Vengeful Cyborg: ok

\-Deep Sea Gargantuar: Why does it buff other zombies? What? Does it just spit on them or something? Where is the buff coming from?!

\-King of the Grill: Gourmet conjures are very fun, but in garg decks this will probs be more useful. Cool.

\-Nurse Gargantuar: As a Nurse Garg hater, I see this as absolutely terrible. It already healed at least 6HP on play! Do you really need it to almost full-heal every turn?? Am I stupid?

\-Octo Zombie: Literally 0 people care

\-Zombot 1000: RIP Zombot field clear from BMR for the clutch o7

# Brainy:

\-Mustache Waxer: As a mustache synergy enjoyer, I see this as an absolute win

\-Duckstache: Same message as seen above

\-Electrician: ok

\-Gentleman Zombie: Makes sense

\-Regifting Zombie reworked: Interesting. Dark Matter Dragonfruit from regifting ftw!!

\-Trick or treater: A bit annoying but I digress

\-Wormhole Gatekeeper: Imagine 4 of these guys. Sounds fun for the first 5 times it happens. After that it just kind of becomes unplayable unless you want games to become a random mess.

\-Zom-blob: ok

\-Pirate's Booty (Quarterly bonus): More bonus attacks... I don't know how I feel about this. Sure? I guess?

\-Gadget Scientist: ok

\-Gargantuar Mime: ok

\-Portal Technician: ok

\-Shieldcrusher viking: Shieldcrusher's main issue was that it could be dealt with in too many ways, so this removes one of the main ways the opponent could nullify it. Cool beans.

\-Wizard Gargantuar: ok lmao

\-Zombot Dinotronic Mechasaur: Sure?

# Crazy:

\-Grave Robber: I'll say more on this in Con Man

\-Con Man: First off, let's absolutely go! Second off, pirate's early game, taking into account the change above too, is overall a lot worse because of these two changes. Sure, you could go like Tombstone Carver into Swashbuckler, but now you have no pirates. Overall huge nerf to pirate decks. Seeing as Guardian Package was pretty heavily hit by this update, this is a welcome change. I'm excited to see a bit more variety in decks.

\-Cuckoo Zombie: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

\-Disco Dance Floor: ok

\-Exploding Fruitcake: Deserved

\-Final Mission: Okay, let's take Berry Blast as an example. It says ""Deal 3 damage"" and is a 2-cost. Now take Final Mission. Before, it was also a 2-cost that could deal 1 extra damage to the opponent's face at the cost of one of your zombies. Now, it's just a worse berry blast. SURE, you do have Barrel of Deadbeards, but aside from that interaction, the hard is heavily hit by this change.

\-Zombot's Wrath: Before it was a pretty mid card, now it's a very circumstantial card. Sure, I guess.

\-Abracadaver: ok

\-Cakesplosion: ok

\-Gizzard Lizard: Now it's not that terrible! Huh.

\-Moon Base Z: ok

\-Headhunter: Headhunter was NOT that good. Why'd they nerf it?

\-Gargantuar Throwing Imp: Hm. 4-cost garg. Interesting.

\-Flamenco Zombie: Doesn't really change anything

\-Frankentaur: I guess this COULD open up lanes for other gargs, but that also kind of goes against its whole functionality. So like.. what?

\-Hippity Hop Garg: More egg! Me likey.

\-Disco-tron 3000: Makes it better. Not significantly, but it does make it better.

# Hearty:

\-Leftovers: Good change

\-Terrify: For what purpose?

\-Landscaper: Sure.. I guess?

\-Bonus Track Buckethead: It's no longer an understat, now it's just a meh card!

\-Celestial Custodian: On one hand, 3 or less is significantly more useful than 2 or less, on the other, people didn't really run custodian to deal with bigger guys, and was overall just a decent kind of cheap card. This doesn't really do anything other than make it slightly worse at what it was meant to do.

\-Turquiose Skull Zombie: Interesting. This could be fun.

\-Zombie King: 0->2 attack; 2->3 attack; 5->6 health; This card does NOT NEED all of the attention it keeps getting. Have you ever seen something called Clique Peas? Now THAT needs a little tweaking imo, at least more than Zombie King.

\-All-star Zombie: Half-playable. With buffs it can become a real threat. Hm.

\-Ra Zombie: Still basically useless.

\-Coffee Zombie: Doesn't really change much, but it does make him slightly better, I guess.

\-Undying Pharaoh: \*sigh\*

\-Zombot Battlecruiser 5000: ok

\-Wannabe Hero: THIS NEEDS UNTRICKABLE! NOT ALL-STAR, NOT GARG MIME! POPCAP THE 3 EXTRA HP WILL NOT DO *ANYTHING* FOR THIS CARD!

# Sneaky:

\-Ducky Tube Zombie: I fail to think of one situation where this would make a difference. Against Admiral Navy Bean? I guess?

\-Mini Ninja: Actually playable now! Decent change.

\-Monkey Smuggler: Okay, by this point, I feel like the pirates have been nerfed enough. It's fine as-is, you can stop now.

\-Captain Flameface no longer has gravestone: Okay, this is a bit much. Yeah, pirates are good, but there are still other combos that after the previous nerfs are good too. You don't need to make the class garbage, just not as good. This change is not THAT relevant, seeing as you can usually predict a Flameface, although I guess you have tricks. I don't know man, it's becoming a bit much I think.

\-Imp Commander: Decent change. Sure.

\-Zombie High Diver: For an amphibious card, this is a buff.. though I guess it is berry blast-able now. I don't know.. who really uses Zombie High Diver anyway?

\-Firefighter: Cool

\-Pogo Zombie: Does literally nothing

\-Tomb Raiser: Hm! Now *that* is interesting. I don't know how I feel about it.

\-Unthawed Viking: Instead

\-Blowgun Imp: ok

\-Cursed Gargolith: I'm not sure I like this very much, but okay, sure..

\-Zombot Stomp: Hm.

# Heroes:

\-Dance-off: Solid

\-Super Brainz Sig (Carried Away): Unnecessary buff, but I guess it makes it more on par with the other supers. Not sure how I feel about this.

\-Brain Freeze Sig (Frozen Tundra): Hm.

\-Immorticia Sig (Witch's Familiar): For a signature, I guess it was not that gamechanging. Sure, I can see the vision.

\-Neptuna Sig (Octo-pult): Did not need a buff, it's pretty good now. Without stats being altered, Frenzy on a 2HP minion does not do much.

His friend bought him a Stitch keychain, but that was a while ago. Again, nothing out of the ordinary. 

Now, within the last two months, by BF has purchased 5 Stitch plushies, two Stitch coffee cups, Stitch salt and pepper shakers, and a Stitch ceramic pot for a plant. One of the plushies is clearly a baby toy that jingles and has rings for teething. 

Otherwise, it's somewhat bearable for me. 

However, I've noticed he has and affinity for children's themed things. He has a Bluey sweater and Bluey band-aids. He likes children themed drinks that come with a push up sucky cap. 

I'll admit it, I have a few Peppa Pig themed things from when I was about 18 and 19 years old. There was a meme going around and some of my friends bought me some Peppa paraphernalia as an ironic joke. Never went past that. But this isn't a joke for my BF. He really likes Stitch for some reason and I don't know how I can even bring it up to him. 

An important note is that my bf is from China, and these cutesy things might be more normalized in China, but I haven't been to China since I was 18, so I'm not sure.

I have tried to make some changes and such to so better. I've  stopped keeping a bunch of sugary or starchy snacks at the house, and replaced them with more protien like nuts and beef sticks. I am trying to add more vegetables into meals. My midwife told me it sounds like a big change I need to make is just doing multiple small meals a day instead of one or two big ones. I worked in a factory for about 6 years and so my diet had just been mainly coffee/energy drinks all day while I heavy eat when I got home. I'm currently not working so I can definitely adjust to eating at more times (I cut the caffine intake when I found out I was pregnant) I am 28 weeks now. But this weekend was FULL of stress/depression eating and I failed the test BIG TIME today. Part of me kind of expected it, as I was already diagnosed with PCOS and insulin resistance before the pregnancy. So now I'm just looking for any tips anyone may have with this new journey of testing and logging my sugar levels.

Fml. 

So the story goes, he gave my his phone pass code because he wanted an honest trustworthy relationship blah blah blah. We moved in together in August. Mid November I opened his phone. Found out he was still using. Not only that, he had shared my diagnosis with his ex wife. Went to a concert with his ex wife. And sent a message that said ""love you always"" the same night we had a date night. There were also many messages of him talking behind my back. Lots of lies to my face. He had attended therapy sessions with me and lied to my therapists face as well. 

We're on a rental lease together, so living together still and I can't stop despising him. I have stolen some of his jewelry. Broken picture frames of him and his ex I found in the storage room. Ripped buttons off his shorts. Bent all his ball caps the wrong way, stretched the neck of a bunch of his t shirts. Drank from his special keepsake liquor. I just seep hatred and anger in his presence. He doesn't know about those thing I have mentioned. But as a result of my attitude he has moved his furniture, taken the tv off the wall mount, moved downstairs. He's hardly home.

I just keep being so childish. So stupid. Petty. I put pepper in his coffee - i don't even know if he notices. I just want to fucking hurt him and I can't make him hurt the way he hurt me, legally. 

And it's just put me into a spiral of depression and self hate. He tells me to get of the couch and do something, that I'm lazy. I can't even shower most days, and when I do, sometimes I don't bother with soap. I'm just such a terrible mess rn. 

And my eating disorder has kicked in full gear. Idk if it's self harm, or some form of control, as they say.

1hajgqn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1hajgqn/aio_about_feeling_disrespected_by_my_manager/,AIO about feeling disrespected by my manager? ,"Hi Reddit, I need some advice about a situation at work that’s been weighing on me. Here’s the full context:

A couple of months ago, I had a conflict with a colleague. It seemed like we had moved past it, but today something strange happened. My manager went to speak with this colleague privately, and when they came back, he started lecturing me.

He told me that I need to “not be negative” and that I should reflect on myself because I’m essentially the reason there’s a strange atmosphere in the workplace. It caught me completely off guard. I’ve been trying to stay professional, and I genuinely didn’t think I was causing any issues.

What made it worse is that during this lecture, he also brought up a completely unrelated incident involving a barista (60 M) at a nearby coffee shop. This guy has acted inappropriately multiple times, like openly touching himself inappropriately while km there because apparently I’m “dead”, threatened to slap my face, commented on the way i look negatively, which obviously made me uncomfortable. I had mentioned this situation to my colleague who is also the store manager since she was in the company before because it’s so unprofessional and gross, but today the main manager seemed to suggest that I was somehow overreacting about that too. Also, my colleague has been trash talking about him since day one and has admitted to kiss his back just to secure the job, often uses degrading insults to refer to him and i think she’s mad i won’t go along with it. When I asked her if I did something to annoy her right after my manager told me that she said she didn’t know why he was saying that. So i sent him this text.

Hi, I wanted to tell you that I was very offended by our conversation today. It seems to me that you are attacking me without really knowing who I am and all the situations that arise in the store, and I find this disrespectful. I have always tried to be positive and respectful towards everyone, even when there were difficult situations, like the one with the gentleman at the bar who promptly crossed the line with too many comments and actions, like touching himself down there when I pass because 'I'm one dead' and more that I'm not here to mention, not showing any respect towards me. I spoke directly with him to try to resolve the situation in a civil manner. Furthermore, several times I kept my mouth shut and pretended not to be disrespected, precisely so as not to create a difficult environment, but now I feel the time has come to talk about it. When I spoke to Vittoria, she couldn't tell me anything concrete about your comments, which makes me feel even more confused and frustrated. I don't agree with the idea that the negative environment depends on me, since I'm not the one who constantly complains about everything. I don't understand why everything is placed on my shoulders, when there are other situations that deserve attention. I hope you can reflect on this.

I feel like my manager is trying to pin everything on me instead of addressing the real issues, and it’s so frustrating. I generally prefer to avoid confrontation and stay discreet, but this situation is making me feel singled out and unsupported.

I never really knew how to be a friend, but have always been a nice person and I can be witty at times.  

A few months ago, one of my favorite receptionists had to quit from the clinic I go to for everything  including mental health services.  I saw her at least 2 times a month and she was always there with a smile and a few kleenex, and I appreciated her so very much.  About a year before she quit, I stopped at her desk and thanked her for always being there and gave her a side hug.  On her last day, she chased me out to my car to let me know she was quitting the office and that I was one of her favorite people.  I brought her flowers and a card that day.  The clinic is just not the same without her!!

Fast forward to today, I ran to the store to get milk.  And thought, I want to see if they have a certain hair product, that brought me to the other side of the store.  Kismet!!  Who is walking towards me, but my favorite receptionist!!!  I walked to her side and she said ""I didn't bring kleenex!!"" With shaky laugh and tears in her eyes.  We talked for a bit and I asked if she wanted to get together for coffee sometime and we exchanged phone numbers.    Whoot!!  

Had I just ran in, grabbed the milk, paid and left, we wouldn't have seen each other!!!  I'm so grateful for suddenly wanting to look for a different product on a whim, I wouldn't feel so good right now!!!  And I got an ""I love you""...which I have never heard in my life from a friend.

The breakup was defiantly one sided, I thought we could work out our in my mind small issues but he didn't. Immediately I went no contact, I blocked him on everything.  I spent my next weeks with friends and family and weekly therapy. Still I was very heartbroken. We did not speak at all for a month.  The only info I heard about him was through a mutual friend saying that he was thinking about me. About a month into the breakup, I received a text from him out of the blue. He asked how I've been and if I'm doing well and the convo fizzled out. We made plans to see each other over Thanksgiving break though. Then we didn't talk for another few weeks. 

We met up for coffee and it was fine, he admitted to being extremely nervous. It was a lighthearted conversation, and I decided to invite him to my birthday party the next weekend (Preface, there were a few hundred people going so it wasn't going to be small and intimate) The day after we had a phone call then went back to no talking. 

 Then, earlier this week he sends me a message to let me know he can't make it to my party, but he'll be free the day after. We ended up having a phone call later and it was positive, we said goodbye. He called me again the next day and we had a bit of an argument; he was confronting me wondering if I've seen new people. I hung up feeling all anxious again. 

The next day he texted me to let me know he was in the area but i decided not to answer. It's probably for the better, Im not opposed to reconnecting but maybe the breakup is too fresh, there's still a lot of hurt that needs to heal. Anyone have any advice?

I'm feeling incredibly depressed although I only made the switch two days ago and I'm actually drinking a little more caffeine than before. Still it feels like withdrawals.

Am I the only one who only craves coffee? For me energy drinks just don't hit the same, no matter the caffeine content. ",0,1733775352.0,decaf,2,0.5,False

*But the fire is so delightful* 🎶

But what if you are itching to *DO* stuff, you're finally here after all! Here are some ideas for a **plan B**, for indoors enjoyment of the Gateway to the Arctic (how we locals *""står han av""\~""keep it together""* when the weather is absolutely *malebarisk*):

**Art and architecture**

* [The City Library](https://no.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troms%C3%B8_bibliotek_og_byarkiv): read international newspapers, meet new friends and admire unique architecture and art displays in *the very heart of Tromsø*.
* [The North-Norwegian Art Museum](https://www.nnkm.no/en/node/103): a collection of over 2,225 works by artists from the 1600s to the present day.
* [Tromsø Center for Contemporary Art](https://www.tromsokunstforening.no/en/about): open to the public during exhibition periods; then the entrance is free, including coffee and tea.
* [Perspektivet Museum](https://perspektivet.no/en/about-the-museum/): strives to provide knowledge and foster curiosity about what it means to be a person with a northern perspective, in several locations including one in the city center.

**Eating, drinking and events**

* [Listening heaven](https://kulturhuset.tr.no/): Tromsø is known for its innovative music scene. Check out an almost endless variety of [concerts and shows](https://allevents.in/troms%C3%B8#).
* Get festive and warm by [eating well](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurants-g190475-Tromso_Troms_Northern_Norway.html) and drinking [locally made drinks](https://www.mack.no/en/visit/): curious local dishes, fresh fish, reindeer, ale and whale (if you can't watch 'em, eat 'em)!
* [The Cable Car](https://www.fjellheisen.no/engelsk/fjellheisen-home): is waterproof (but not windproof, alas) and there is a restaurant with a good roof and an unbeatable view on top.
* [Want some coffee with that](https://www.google.no/maps/search/troms%C3%B8+kafe/)? You bet! Coffee is the ultimate sign of friendliness in the north and it can be joyously had whenever, to whatever.

**Historical and science exhibitions**

* [The Polar Museum](https://en.uit.no/tmu/polarmuseet): learn about polar expeditions and exploration, located in the middle of the city center.
* [Polaria](https://polaria.no/en/): an activity center and aquarium with live seals. Plan for seal feeding and combat cloudy skies with a taped Northern Lights show.
* [MS Polstjerna](https://www.visittromso.no/book/to-do/882320/ms-polstjerna/showdetails): a real sealing vessel, rigged to give an authentic experience, placed right next to Polaria.
* [The Arctic University Museum](https://en.uit.no/tmu): Learn about Arctic sciences: like, what are the Northern Lights really made of? And when did the Sami start to ski?
* [The Northern Lights Planetarium](https://www.visittromso.no/no/filmvisninger-og-nordlys-i-norges-storste-planetarium): a planetarium and science center for the whole family, including an ""extreme Northern Lights show"".

**Sports activities**

* [Tromsøbadet](https://www.tromsobadet.no/en/): a large indoor (and a little-bit outdoor) pool and swimming center, hot and cold, deep and shallow pools, relaxing tubs and exciting slides.
* [Tromsø klatresenter](https://www.tromsoklatresenter.no/information-in-english): a climbing club for any level, with drop in service and courses.
* [Pust sauna](https://www.pust.io/en/badstue/tromso/): get warm in the city center sauna and refreshed in the Arctic Sea! Especially nice in extremely lousy winter weather. Bring a woolen cap!
* [Storgata Camping](https://campingen.no/tromso): an indoor mini golf course, roller disco, the world's northernmost private karaoke room, bar, scene, night club and event space.

\---

Lastly, try to enjoy the exotic craziness! As a true local, extreme weather warnings make me grin like a loon, and the wilder the better - as long as nobody gets hurt. Please take good care of yourself, as we would love to have you back here again.

1haj4rc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamInterpretation/comments/1haj4rc/stress_dreams/,Stress dreams?,"Been having a lot of stress dreams and nightmares for a couple months now, but the last week has been really bad. Here are three that I can recall, all from the past 5 days:

First night:
At my college graduation (I graduated back in May), and then being led onto a yellow school bus, where I am told I need to repeat some high school classes. The bus goes on the route from when I was a kid (strange since I went to college far from home). On that bus are my childhood bully and some friends from high school who I've lost touch with, because my parents thought they were bad influences.

Second night:
I'm at a fencing tournament but with real sabres (I used to fence sabre in middle and high school). I get cut a lot and I end up killing some of the other participants, but they won't let me leave. Very bloody, visceral and scary. This is the only one I would describe as a ""real"" nightmare.

Third night: 
I'm in my childhood home as an adult. I moved away when I was a small child but I vividly remember the rooms in the house. I'm drinking a bottle of vodka with my girlfriend at a coffee table while sitting on the floor in the living room with my back to the doorway. It's night and the entire house is dark except for the living room. There's something scary (or evil?) that I can feel lurking around in the dark so I keep whipping my head around looking at the doorway trying to see in the dark. My girlfriend keeps pouring me drinks and makes me drink more even though the vodka tastes extremely bitter. She keeps telling me there's nothing in the house and I start yelling and freaking out that there is, but for some reason I can't turn my body around to check for sure.

Most of my other dreams for the past few months had a very similar vibe. Any way to make it stop? I have trouble sleeping so I use 25 mg doxylamine succinate or 1 mg melatonin and I've read that might have something to do with it. I'm really dreading bedtime now but I need to sleep for work. Does the content of my dreams have anything to do with my waking life?",1,1733775196.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False
1haj4i4,https://www.reddit.com/r/cf4cf/comments/1haj4i4/sf_bay_area_but_south_bay_meetup_gauging_interest/,Sf Bay Area (but South Bay) meetup? Gauging interest ,"I saw the post below but “sf Bay Area” is a huge area, and it seemed like it was more inclined for SF, which, getting into as a South Bay resident is very troublesome. 

How much interest (most likely for 2025) would folks be for South Bay/peninsula maybe like Mountain View or north San Jose? I understand the ratio of guys and girls may be wildly imbalanced, but hey, make new friends right? 

Since this sub doesn’t allow polls, I’m curious what people lean towards: 
- a place that serves alcohol, like a bar, taproom, casual American eats. Most likely in evening. 

- more laid back place that serves boba tea and or coffee, snacks, etc and has a common mingling area. Can be day or night.
