1o7ypj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/coffee_kitchen/comments/1o7ypj6/is_black_coffee_really_the_healthiest_choice/,Is Black Coffee Really the Healthiest Choice?,"When you think of “healthy coffee,” the first image that comes to mind is probably a steaming cup of **plain black coffee** — no sugar, no milk, just pure roasted flavor. But is it really the healthiest way to drink coffee?  
Let’s explore what experts say, what science shows, and how it affects your body.

# 🌅 1. What Is Black Coffee, Really?

Black coffee is simply **brewed coffee without any added ingredients** — no milk, cream, or sugar.  
It’s made from just two things:

* **Coffee beans** (ground and brewed)
* **Water**

That’s it.  
This means black coffee contains **zero fat, zero sugar, and almost no calories**, which is why many people see it as the healthiest version of coffee.

# ⚕️ 2. Why Black Coffee Is Considered Healthy

Here’s what makes black coffee a health favorite among doctors, fitness coaches, and nutritionists:

# ✅ Low in Calories

One cup of black coffee (8 oz) has **only 2 calories** — compared to a cappuccino or latte that can have over 120 calories.

# ✅ Packed with Antioxidants

Coffee is rich in **polyphenols** and **hydrocinnamic acids**, powerful antioxidants that help protect your cells from damage.

>

# ✅ Boosts Metabolism

Caffeine increases your metabolic rate by **3–11%**, helping your body burn fat more efficiently — which is why many people drink it before workouts.

# ✅ Improves Brain Function

Caffeine blocks adenosine (a brain chemical that makes you sleepy) and increases dopamine and norepinephrine — boosting alertness and mood.

# ✅ May Lower Disease Risk

Studies suggest that regular black coffee drinkers have a **lower risk of heart disease, liver issues, and type 2 diabetes** when consumed in moderation.

# 📊 Nutrition Facts: Black Coffee vs Other Coffees

|**Type of Coffee**|**Calories (8 oz)**|**Sugar (g)**|**Fat (g)**|**Main Benefit**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Black Coffee**|2|0|0|Boosts metabolism|
|**Latte**|120|12|6|Calcium, but high in sugar|
|**Cappuccino**|80|6|4|Creamy texture|
|**Iced Mocha**|250|30|8|Taste, but high sugar|

So, if you’re watching your weight or sugar intake, **black coffee clearly wins**.

# 🧠 3. Expert Insights from gomehedi

During our interviews at **gomehedi**, several coffee and health experts shared their thoughts:

>

>

So while black coffee is healthiest, the real key is **balance** — what you add (and how much) makes a difference.

# ⚖️ 4. When Black Coffee Might Not Be the Best Choice

Black coffee isn’t perfect for everyone. Some people may need to be careful, especially if they have sensitive stomachs or anxiety.

Here’s when it might not be ideal:

* ⚠️ **If you have acid reflux:** Coffee’s acidity can irritate your stomach.
* ⚠️ **If you’re sensitive to caffeine:** It can cause jitters, anxiety, or insomnia.
* ⚠️ **If you skip meals:** Black coffee on an empty stomach can lead to discomfort or nausea.

💡 **Pro Tip from gomehedi:**  
If you find black coffee too harsh, add a small splash of milk or use **low-acid coffee beans** — they’re gentler on your stomach but still healthy.

# ❤️ 5. How to Make Black Coffee Taste Better (Without Losing Health Benefits)

Many people skip black coffee because of its bitterness. But you can make it taste better naturally:

* 🌱 Use **freshly ground beans** for richer flavor.
* 💧 Brew with **filtered water** to avoid bitterness.
* ☕ Try **cold brew** — it’s naturally smoother and less acidic.
* 🍫 Add a **pinch of cinnamon or cocoa powder** for flavor, not sugar.
* 🧂 A **tiny pinch of salt** can reduce bitterness instantly.

# 📈 6. What Research Says About Black Coffee and Longevity

Several studies have found that moderate coffee drinkers tend to live longer.  
According to the **Harvard School of Public Health**, drinking **2–4 cups of black coffee per day** is linked to a lower risk of premature death.

|**Daily Cups of Coffee**|**Health Impact**|
|:-|:-|
|1–2 Cups|Boosts alertness and focus|
|3–4 Cups|May reduce risk of heart disease and diabetes|
|Over 6 Cups|Can increase anxiety and sleep problems|

So, moderation is key — too much of anything, even black coffee, isn’t healthy.

# 🔍 7. My Honest Opinion

After testing and researching for **gomehedi**, here’s my honest take:  
**Yes, black coffee is the healthiest choice** — but it’s not for everyone.

If you enjoy its pure flavor and your stomach handles it well, go for it!  
But if you prefer adding a little milk or natural sweetener, that’s perfectly fine too. The goal is to make your coffee both **enjoyable and balanced**.

Black coffee is simple, strong, and full of health benefits — from boosting energy to protecting your heart.  
It’s low in calories, rich in antioxidants, and great for metabolism.

However, everyone’s body is different. The healthiest coffee is the one that makes you **feel good, stay energized, and fits your lifestyle**.

As we often say at **gomehedi** — *“It’s not just about the coffee you drink, but how it makes your day better.”*



# My Morning Ritual: How I Fell in Love with Black Coffee

I still remember the first time I tried black coffee. It was bitter, strong, and honestly, I didn’t like it. But as I started learning more about coffee on **gomehedi**, I realized that the pure taste of coffee without sugar or cream has its own charm — and surprising health benefits.

Most people I know can’t start their day without a cup of coffee loaded with sugar, cream, or flavored syrup. But what if I told you that **black coffee** — plain and simple — might be the **healthiest version** of your favorite drink?

Let’s find out why.

# 2. What Exactly Is Black Coffee?

Black coffee is simply **brewed coffee without any added sugar, milk, or cream**. You can make it in many ways — espresso, pour-over, French press, or instant coffee — as long as you don’t mix anything else into it.

Here’s a quick look:

|Type of Black Coffee|Description|Taste Level (1–5)|Caffeine (per 8 oz)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Espresso|Strong and concentrated|☕☕☕☕☕|63 mg|
|Drip Coffee|Classic and smooth|☕☕☕☕|95 mg|
|French Press|Bold and rich|☕☕☕☕☕|107 mg|
|Instant Coffee|Fast and mild|☕☕☕|60–80 mg|

# 🧠 Boosts Brain Health

# 6. Real Customer Story

“When I switched to black coffee, it was tough for a week. But then, I started feeling more energetic and less bloated. Now I can’t imagine my mornings without it!”

# 7. How to Make Black Coffee Taste Better

Black coffee may not please everyone’s taste buds at first, but it’s a **simple, powerful, and healthy choice** for your body.  
And who knows — maybe one morning, you’ll sip your cup of black coffee, smile, and think, *“This is how real coffee should taste.”*

# Section 1: My Journey with Black Coffee – From Bitter to Better

When I first tried black coffee, I almost spat it out.  
It was strong, bitter, and nothing like the creamy latte I loved.

But one morning, while reading a blog post on gomehedi, I learned how coffee’s real flavor hides under the layers of milk and sugar. That made me curious — so I decided to give black coffee another chance.

At first, I struggled. I missed the sweetness. But after a few days, I began to notice something amazing — I felt lighter, more focused, and less tired during the day. My energy levels were steady, not like before when sugar made me crash after an hour.

This experience made me realize something important:  
Black coffee isn’t just a drink — it’s a lifestyle change.

I wanted to know if it was really healthier or if I just felt that way. So I started reading studies, talking to baristas, and even interviewing nutritionists on gomehedi. What I found surprised me.

Let’s explore the truth behind black coffee — the good, the bad, and how to enjoy it the right way.

# 🔹 Section 2: What Makes Black Coffee So Healthy?

When people say black coffee is healthy, they’re not wrong. It’s actually one of the simplest, cleanest drinks you can enjoy every day.

Here’s why:

# 🩸 1. It’s Naturally Low in Calories

Black coffee has 0–5 calories per cup.  
That’s almost nothing! Compare that to a regular latte, which can have 150–250 calories, mostly from milk and sugar.

Here’s a quick comparison table:

|Type of Coffee|Average Calories (per cup)|Sugar (grams)|Fat (grams)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Black Coffee|2|0|0|
|Latte|190|18|9|
|Cappuccino|120|10|6|
|Mocha|240|27|10|

Source: National Coffee Association, 2025

So, if you drink 2 cups of latte daily, switching to black coffee could save you about 300 calories per day — or over 9,000 calories per month!

That’s almost 3 pounds of fat burned just by changing your drink.

# 💪 2. Boosts Metabolism and Helps Weight Loss

Black coffee contains caffeine, a natural stimulant that increases your metabolic rate by up to 11%, according to Harvard Health.  
This means your body burns more calories — even when you’re sitting.

>

That’s why many people drink black coffee before a morning jog or gym session. It’s a natural pre-workout drink — no chemicals, no sugar, just energy.

# 🧠 3. Improves Brain Health

A 2023 study by Harvard University found that people who drink 3–4 cups of black coffee daily have a 32% lower risk of Alzheimer’s and 29% lower risk of Parkinson’s.

The antioxidants in coffee protect your brain cells from damage.

>

So, when you sip your morning black coffee, you’re not just waking up — you’re protecting your brain too.

# ❤️ 4. Supports Heart Health

Many people think coffee is bad for the heart, but science says otherwise.  
Studies show that moderate coffee drinkers (2–3 cups daily) have a 15% lower risk of heart disease.

Black coffee improves blood circulation, reduces inflammation, and may even help balance cholesterol levels.

>

# 🩺 5. Lowers Risk of Type 2 Diabetes

According to a 2022 study by the American Diabetes Association, regular coffee drinkers are 30% less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes — especially those who drink it black.

That’s because black coffee improves insulin sensitivity and helps your body regulate blood sugar better.

# 🔹 Section 3: The Other Side – When Black Coffee Isn’t for Everyone

Of course, no drink is perfect.  
While black coffee has amazing benefits, drinking too much can have downsides — especially if you’re sensitive to caffeine.

# ⚠️ 1. Too Much Can Cause Jitters or Anxiety

If you drink more than 4–5 cups a day, you might feel restless or have trouble sleeping.  
Your heart might beat faster, or you may feel uneasy.

>

# 😬 2. It Can Upset Your Stomach

Coffee is slightly acidic, which can cause heartburn or acidity in some people — especially when taken on an empty stomach.

Simple fix:  
Have your black coffee after breakfast or pair it with a small snack like nuts or toast.

# 😴 3. It Can Disturb Sleep

Avoid drinking black coffee after 4 PM, as caffeine stays in your system for hours and can disrupt your sleep.

Pro tip from gomehedi:  
Try decaf black coffee in the evening — same flavor, less caffeine.

# 🔹 Section 4: How to Make Black Coffee Taste Amazing (Without Sugar)

Not everyone loves black coffee right away. But with the right brewing method, you can turn bitterness into beauty.

Here’s how to make it taste better:

# ☕ 1. Choose Good Coffee Beans

Always pick freshly roasted beans.  
Look for labels like “100% Arabica” or “single-origin.” These are smoother and less bitter.

# 🧂 2. Add Natural Flavor Boosters

You don’t need sugar to make coffee delicious. Try this instead:

* A pinch of cinnamon for warmth
* A few drops of vanilla extract
* A sprinkle of cocoa powder
* A dash of sea salt to cut bitterness

# 🧊 3. Try It Cold

Cold brew black coffee is naturally sweeter and smoother than hot black coffee because it’s brewed slowly with cold water. Perfect for summer mornings.

# 🫗 4. Brew It Right

Here are a few easy brewing methods you can try:

|Method|Time|Flavor|Ideal For|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Drip Coffee Maker|5 mins|Balanced|Beginners|
|French Press|4 mins|Bold|Strong Coffee Lovers|
|Pour-Over|3 mins|Clean|Coffee Purists|
|Instant Coffee|1 min|Mild|Busy Mornings|

# 💬 Real-Life Story: How Black Coffee Changed My Routine

“I started drinking black coffee after reading about its benefits on gomehedi,” says Lisa, a 32-year-old teacher.  
“At first, I missed the sugar, but after two weeks, I felt lighter, more focused, and even lost a little weight. Now, I can’t imagine coffee any other way!”

How many things I “accidentally” broke:

Printers, instant hot water dispensers, kettles, coffee makers, the faucet, uh hopefully not the dishwasher but at least that’s easy to “repair”. 99.99% of the “broken” are caused by the lack of cleaning because “I’m gonna do it after I finish my homework”, I feel this is literally top tiered laziness drilled into my brain, and my brain keeps telling me it’s unacceptable but it’s still gonna happen unfortunately

She is very loyal and would do just about anything for a good friend. She’s very brave, a rabbit who will not back down from scary things easily. She is also very energetic and curious. Paisley is also resilient, impulsive, a little idealistic, assertive, protective (at least when it comes to Bailey) and tactile. She does not stay down for long about anything, gets excited over some things easily, stands her ground and when she feels saddened or nervous, she will clean her ears with her paws. She is very kinetic-thinking and versatile. She also fears emotional disconnection.

Paisley is Bailey’s younger sister. If Bailey is upset about something, she will sit quietly beside him or maybe try to cheer him up with a joke. She is an outward protector but when she needs protection internally, she often turns to Bailey. As such, if Bailey sets a tough boundary, Paisley can struggle a little with it at times. Paisley also finds that sleep comes easier and faster when she and Bailey stay up in their beds, making up stories together. Bailey is like a gentle home to her.

Hobbies: Ribbon collecting, swatch or fat quarter collecting, tea cup collecting, reading art or fashion magazines and newsletters, playing tag or hide & seek, blowing bubbles, exploring new spaces, making dresses, playing shadow tag (in which she hops into others’ shadows) and camping. 

Likes: Teacups featuring lemon designs, bubble wands, pretty fabrics, buttons, pretty hair brushes (this usually means antique ceramic ones with shabby chic floral prints), roasted marshmallows, roasted carrots, strawberry shortcake, cucumber sandwiches, apple chips, red apple slices, peach cobbler, cinnamon/honey/jasmine tea, hibiscus/rosehip tea, snuggly soft blankets, colorful thread, apple juice, grape juice, chocolate icecream, peppermint candy, lettuce leaves, green grapes, milk tea, fried sweet potato slices, buttercream and carrot cupcakes, almonds, pineapple slices, caramel swiss rolls, cherry blossom swiss rolls, cherry icebox cookies, lemon pie, cherry pie, strawberry macarons, lemon macarons, mango pudding and chocolate cream sandwich cookies.

Dislikes: Spicy food, artificial fruit flavors, coffee without milk or cream, energy drinks, feeling left out, being rushed by others, being told to “grow up” and being told she’s being “immature”.


I will probably be adding more to her character profile after she and Bailey arrive and I get to know them more, hence… Wiki.

So... I have been rewatching random Charlotte videos (love you!) and some were crazy ex videos from TikTok and it made me realize that I should share this cautionary tale...

I (24f) work retail and a guy who was a regular (30m) would come in several days a week and if we were slow enough, I'd make conversation. Over several weeks, we started to become friends (or so I thought) and he ended up asking to go out. I said yes since I thought he was a good guy. I think this may be the only smart thing I did... I told him it had to be in public and that I needed to be able to walk there, as I can't drive. 
We went to a nearby coffee shop for the first date and I thought it went well. He was polite and fun to talk to. 

A couple weeks in, we had a double date with his grandparents (his grandmother was a great woman). I started going to his house before/after work 1-3 times a week. Two weeks into that, I started to see what he was like when drinking. He got violent, throwing stuff that nearly hit my head. I didn't say anything. I just froze. That was the case for most of the days I went there. Week five of dating, I finally said something. I told him that we were done. I was scared.

All. The. Time. 

For a week, he went into my job daily, not knowing if I'd be there. That is, until the shift he knew I had, since I always did. He came in 3 times during a shift, giving me a note with BLOOD on it. I tried for a restraining order but was denied. Phone calls/voicemails/texts for 5 months. They stopped, I thought I was free. 
NOPE!

After 4 free months, he showed up AT MY HOUSE. Thank god for the men in the house. I was panicking and ended up with a restraining order after THAT. It was so traumatizing that my brain blocked it out. At the the visuals, the anxiety is something I still feel often, even though that was 5 months ago.

when the news broke that Oliver Keith had proposed.
Not to me.
To her.
Leslie Wells. The perfect princess with perfect timing.
It wasn’t the first time he chose someone else.
Not the first time he left me bleeding while he played hero for another woman.
But it was the last time I let it break me.
He came back later, full of apologies and regret. Said he loved me. Said he'd give it all up if I just said the word.
But by then, I wasn’t the girl who waited for him to choose me anymore.
I was Andrea Duncan—reborn in betrayal, crowned in blood, and building an empire without him.
And Oliver?
He could only stand outside my kingdom and remember what it felt like to be loved by a queen.

Chapter 1
The safe house smelled like gunpowder and sweat. Andrea Duncan fastened her bra, her fingers still trembling from the adrenaline rush. Three million in cash, twenty kilos moved—another win for the Duncan family.
""That was intense,"" she breathed, watching Oliver Keith scroll through his phone, his bare chest still glistening. ""The Italians didn't even see it coming.""
Oliver's eyes flicked up, taking in her half-dressed state with appreciation before his expression shifted. ""Speaking of surprises... I need you tomorrow night. My parents arranged a dinner. They want me to meet someone.""
Andrea's hands froze on her shirt buttons. ""Meet someone?""
""Leslie Wells. She's back from Paris."" He pulled on his pants, casual as ever. ""I need you there to keep things smooth when conversation dies.""
Her stomach dropped. ""You're being set up? Then what am I to you?""
Oliver was already buttoning his shirt, not even looking at her. ""You know what you are, Andy. My right hand at deals, my drinking partner, and..."" he smirked, his eyes finally meeting hers, ""the best stress relief a man could ask for.""
The words hit harder than any punch. Andrea's lip trembled as five years of memories crashed down on her.
Seeing her expression, Oliver's smile faded. He stepped closer, using that low, intimate voice. ""Come on, Andy. You didn't actually think this was... real? That we were together?""
""Of course not,"" she whispered, her voice breaking. ""I need to clean up.""
She locked herself in the bathroom and slid down against the door, pressing her palms against her eyes to stop the tears.
Five years. They'd grown up together on Chicago's North Side, two crime family kids who did everything together. Their first kiss happened right here after a successful weapons deal, high on adrenaline and whiskey. She'd been nineteen, pressed against these walls while Oliver whispered things that made her blush even now.
One night became a hundred. They were explosive together—neighbors in their building had complained more than once. During the day, they played couple at every family event. Her phone was full of his late-night messages from Miami, Detroit, Vegas. Sweet words typed between bloody business.
She'd been so sure they were together, just keeping it quiet until their families were ready for the merger.
But now Oliver was telling her she was just convenient entertainment?
The shower ran cold before she finally emerged.
Oliver sat on the leather couch, still on his phone. ""Make sure the private room at The Drake is perfect. She likes French cuisine, so bring in that chef from Chicago Cut. Pink and white roses—fill the whole damn room. And have my tailor ready with new suits. Leslie always loved me in black.""
Leslie. The princess of the Wells family, Chicago's third-biggest crime syndicate.
Andrea remembered her—perfect smile, perfect grades, perfect daughter who left for ""art school"" in Paris. Oliver had been obsessed, following her around their prep school like a puppy.
When Leslie left, Andrea thought she finally had her chance. That Oliver's attention had shifted to her.
What a joke.
Her phone crashed to the floor. Oliver glanced over, completely casual.
""You good? Lock up when you leave. Cleaner's already paid."" He grabbed his jacket, heading for the door. At the threshold, he turned back with that insufferable smirk.
""Andy, you've always been one of the guys to me. Don't get all emotional now—makes me think you've been reading this wrong.""
His voice dropped lower, crueler. ""We know each other inside and out. Every secret, every scar, every way to make each other scream. If we tried dating for real? We'd be bored in a week. Some things are better kept... uncomplicated.""
The door clicked shut behind him.
Andrea sat on the rumpled sheets where they'd spent countless nights, and laughed. Bitter, broken laughter that turned to tears.
So that's all she was. Oliver Keith's favorite toy. His go-to girl when he needed release after a bloody night.
She didn't leave until sunrise, walking through Chicago's empty streets in the rain, designer heels clicking on wet pavement.
Her parents were waiting when she stumbled through the Duncan mansion's door, soaked and shaking.
""Andrea! Why didn't you call the driver?""
She looked at them with hollow eyes. ""That expansion to Barcelona you keep pushing? I'm in. Let's go and never look back.""
Her parents exchanged shocked looks. They'd been trying to convince her for months.
""Are you sure? What about Oliver—""
""There is no Oliver and me. Never was. I just told you that so you'd stop trying to set me up with the Rossi boy.""
That night, she filled garbage bags with everything Oliver had ever given her. The Cartier watch for her twenty-first birthday. The Prada dresses from their Vegas trips. The leather jacket that smelled like his cologne.
All of it went in the trash.
Andrea Duncan was done being anyone's dirty little secret.

Chapter 2
The private room at Gibson's Steakhouse was suffocating. Andrea sat across from Oliver and Leslie, watching them laugh over imported wine. The most powerful crime families in Chicago, playing house over filet mignon.
Leslie Wells looked exactly like Andrea remembered—perfect blonde hair, perfect smile, perfect daughter of the Wells empire. Five years in Paris had only polished her shine.
""It's such a coincidence,"" Leslie purred, touching Oliver's arm. ""In high school, you were always everywhere I went. Must have been fate.""
Andrea watched Oliver's ears turn red. She knew the truth—he'd stalked Leslie's schedule, ""accidentally"" showing up wherever she was. Andrea had been his shadow then, watching him chase his dream girl.
""I heard you two are practically family,"" Leslie said, her green eyes studying Andrea. ""Childhood friends, right?""
Before Andrea could answer, Oliver's mother jumped in. ""Oh yes! These two have been inseparable since diapers. We used to joke about arranging their marriage—""
""Mom."" Oliver's voice was sharp. He threw an arm around Andrea's shoulders, brotherly and dismissive. ""Andy and I would never work like that. Right?""
""Right,"" Andrea agreed, her smile razor-sharp. ""I'd rather date a cop than Oliver.""
His arm tensed before dropping away.
The conversation turned to business—territories, shipments, the Europeans Leslie had connected with. Andrea excused herself to the bathroom, needing air.
In the mirror, she looked pale. Tired. She splashed cold water on her face, thinking about her parents' offer. Barcelona. New territory. Far from Oliver Keith and his perfect princess.
When she returned, Oliver and Leslie were sharing dessert, feeding each other bites of chocolate cake like a movie scene.
""Andrea,"" her father called from the main table. ""Come sit. We're discussing the European expansion.""
She gladly escaped to her parents' side, listening to their plans. New routes through Spain. Clean money through art galleries. A fresh start.
""We'd need someone there full-time,"" her mother said carefully. ""Someone who knows the business but can handle being away from... Chicago.""
Andrea met her parents' knowing looks. They understood more than she'd realized.
""I'll go,"" she said firmly. ""Three months to set up operations. Then permanent relocation if it works.""
Across the room, Oliver's head snapped up. She ignored him.
After dinner, the families walked to their cars together. Oliver caught Andrea's wrist in the parking lot.
""Europe? When were you going to tell me?""
She yanked free. ""Why would I? We're not together, remember? I'm just your stress relief.""
""Andy—""
""My name is Andrea."" She stepped back. ""And you should focus on your fiancée. She's waiting.""
Leslie stood by Oliver's Bentley, designer coat wrapped tight, watching them with calculating eyes.
Andrea turned away, joining her parents in their armored SUV. Through the bulletproof glass, she watched Oliver help Leslie into his car, playing the perfect gentleman.
""Barcelona will be good for you,"" her mother said softly.
Andrea nodded, already thinking about plane tickets and new beginnings. Anything to get away from Oliver Keith and the mess she'd made of her heart.

Chapter 3
Three nights later, Andrea found herself in Oliver's Bentley, heading to a warehouse in Cicero. A major deal with the Mexicans—too important for personal drama.
Leslie sat between them in the back, nervously clutching her designer purse. Her first real taste of the family business.
""Why did I have to come?"" Leslie whispered to Oliver.
""You want to marry into this life? You need to see it."" His voice was cold, professional. This was Oliver the soldier, not the lovesick boy.
Andrea checked her Glock, movements automatic after years of practice. She caught Oliver watching her in the mirror and looked away.
The warehouse was too quiet. Andrea's instincts screamed danger, but the deal was already in motion. Five million in heroin, enough to supply half of Chicago.
They were walking back to the car when the shots started.
""Ambush!"" Andrea yelled, drawing her weapon. Glass shattered around them as rival soldiers opened fire.
Oliver threw himself over Leslie, dragging her behind a concrete barrier. Andrea dove the opposite direction, returning fire. A bullet grazed her shoulder, tearing through leather and flesh.
""Where's our backup?"" she shouted, dropping two shooters.
""Five minutes out!"" Oliver yelled back. He had Leslie pressed against the ground, his body shielding every inch of her.
Andrea counted muzzle flashes. Six, maybe seven shooters. She was pinned down, blood soaking her jacket. Her clip ran empty.
""Oliver! Need cover!""
But when she looked, he was already moving—half-carrying Leslie to their armored car, leaving Andrea behind enemy lines.
A rival soldier rounded her barrier. Andrea grabbed a piece of rebar, swinging hard. His skull cracked, blood spraying across concrete.
By the time Duncan soldiers arrived, Andrea had killed three men with her bare hands. She stood in the warehouse lights, covered in blood that wasn't all hers, watching Oliver's taillights disappear.
Her father found her at the Duncan family's private clinic, getting stitched up without anesthesia. She hadn't said a word since the ambush.
""Twenty-two stitches,"" he said quietly. ""Could have been worse.""
""He left me."" Her voice was flat. ""Bullets flying, and he picked her.""
""I know, baby. I know.""
Andrea stared at the ceiling, decision made. ""Book me a flight to Barcelona. One way.""
Her father squeezed her uninjured shoulder. ""Consider it done.""

Chapter 4
The Duncan family's private hospital smelled like bleach and blood. Andrea lay in her bed, shoulder throbbing despite the morphine drip. Twenty-two stitches held her together where the bullet had torn through.
""You hear the news?"" Maria, her nurse and her father's cousin, checked the IV bag. ""Oliver Keith went on a rampage last night.""
Andrea kept her eyes closed. ""Don't care.""
""Killed seven Colombians. The ones who ordered the ambush."" Maria lowered her voice. ""Said they touched something that belonged to him.""
Andrea's eyes snapped open. ""Leslie?""
""Who else? Princess got a scratch on her precious hand. Oliver lost his mind."" Maria shook her head. ""Never seen him like that. Even brought in the Torelli brothers to help clean house.""
The Torelli brothers were expensive. Psychotic, but expensive. Oliver only used them for messages written in blood.
""Good for him,"" Andrea said flatly. ""True love and all that.""
Maria gave her a long look. ""Honey, everyone knows you and Oliver—""
""There is no me and Oliver."" Andrea hit the call button. ""I need more pain meds.""
""You just had—""
""I need more.""
But the drugs couldn't touch the real pain. The knowledge that Oliver had started a war for a scratch on Leslie's hand while Andrea bled out in a warehouse.
Dr. Martinez arrived to check her wounds. ""Surgery in an hour. Need to make sure there's no nerve damage.""
""Whatever."" Andrea stared at the ceiling. ""Just knock me out.""
They wheeled her through the private corridors, past rooms full of recovering soldiers and victims of the life. Through the windows, she glimpsed the hospital's garden—a peaceful spot for families to pretend their loved ones weren't dying from bullet wounds.
""Hold up,"" someone called. ""Mr. Keith wants the garden for an hour.""
Andrea's gurney stopped. Through the glass, she had a perfect view of what came next.
Oliver stood among the roses, looking like something out of a magazine in his black suit. Leslie sat on a bench, her bandaged hand delicately placed in her lap. The setting sun painted everything gold.
""No,"" Andrea whispered. ""No, no, no.""
But she couldn't look away.
Oliver dropped to one knee, pulling out a box. Even from here, Andrea could see the ring—massive, flawless, worth more than most people's houses.
""Leslie Wells,"" Oliver's voice carried through the glass. ""Five years ago, you left before I could tell you how I felt. I won't make that mistake again.""
Andrea's heart shattered with each word.
""Last night, when those animals tried to hurt you, I realized something. I'd burn this whole city down to keep you safe. I'd take every territory from here to Detroit. Make Chicago ours.""
Leslie gasped, playing the perfect surprised princess.
""I'm not just offering you a ring,"" Oliver continued. ""I'm offering you an empire. Every crew, every corner, every dollar that flows through this city. Marry me, and I'll lay Chicago at your feet.""
""Yes!"" Leslie threw herself into his arms. ""Yes, Oliver, yes!""
They kissed among the roses while Andrea watched, frozen on her gurney. The nurses around her whispered excitedly—a Keith-Wells union would change everything.
""Can we move?"" Andrea asked, voice raw. ""Please?""
But Oliver was sliding the ring onto Leslie's finger, and Leslie was crying pretty tears, and somewhere in Andrea's chest, something died.
""Beautiful,"" Maria murmured. ""Like a fairytale.""
Andrea laughed, high and broken. ""Yeah. Beautiful.""
They finally wheeled her away, but the image burned behind her eyelids. Oliver on his knees for another woman. Oliver promising the empire they'd built together to someone else.
In the operating room, as they placed the mask over her face, Andrea made a decision.
""Tell my father,"" she mumbled as the anesthesia took hold. ""Tell him I'm ready for Barcelona. Tell him...""
But the drugs pulled her under before she could finish.
Her last thought was of Oliver's voice, promising Leslie the world. The same world where Andrea bled alone in warehouses, forgotten the moment a prettier prize appeared.
When she woke, she'd be different. Harder. Colder.
The Andrea who loved Oliver Keith would die on this operating table. What remained would be something else entirely.
Something that didn't break.
Something that didn't feel.
Something that survived.

Chapter 5
""Why am I here, Oliver?"" Andrea stood in the middle of Hermès on Michigan Avenue, watching him inspect handbags with unusual interest.
""Need your opinion."" He held up a pink Birkin. ""Leslie loves these things.""
It had been two weeks since the hospital. Two weeks since watching him propose to another woman. The stitches were out, but the scar remained—inside and out.
""Get the black one,"" Andrea said flatly. ""More practical.""
Oliver's mouth quirked. ""Always thinking ahead.""
They moved through Chicago's Gold Coast like old times—Cartier, Chanel, Prada. But Andrea wasn't naive. She recognized the patterns. Jewelry boxes with hidden compartments. Handbags with reinforced bottoms. Designer luggage that would sail through customs uninspected.
""You're using Wells connections to expand into Europe,"" she said as they waited for another purchase to be wrapped.
""Smart girl."" Oliver didn't deny it. ""Which brings me to why you're really here.""
Andrea's stomach dropped. ""No.""
""The Duncan routes through Montreal. I need them.""
""Absolutely not.""
Oliver stepped closer, voice dropping. ""Barcelona, three years ago. Your grandfather was cornered in that warehouse. The Russians had him surrounded.""
Andrea's hands clenched. She knew where this was going.
""I took a hit getting him out,"" Oliver continued, touching his side where the scar was. ""Lost two of my best men. Your grandfather promised me three wishes for saving his life.""
""That debt was between you and him—""
""First wish: you teaching me the Duncan supply routes. Used that already."" Oliver counted on his fingers. ""Second: you coming with me to that Detroit deal last year. Nearly got us both ended, but we made millions.""
Andrea remembered. A violent negotiation that ended with them controlling the entire Eastern corridor.
""This is number three,"" Oliver said simply. ""My birthday party next week. You'll be there. You'll smile. You'll make nice with the Wells family and help smooth over any concerns about our alliance.""
""My grandfather's gone. His promises went with him.""
""Did they?"" Oliver pulled out his phone, playing a voice recording. Her grandfather's distinctive rasp filled the boutique.
""I, Antonio Duncan, swear on my family's honor. Three wishes to Oliver Keith, whatever he asks, whenever he asks. This I promise for my life.""
Andrea recognized the words. Old country promises. The kind that bound families for generations.
""You recorded him?""
""Insurance."" Oliver pocketed the phone. ""Your family's all about honor, right? What would your father say if he knew you broke Antonio's last promise?""
The store clerk returned with their packages. Oliver handed over a black card, buying fifty thousand in merchandise without blinking.
""Besides,"" he continued as they walked out, ""it's just one night. Show up, congratulate us on our engagement, then you can run to Spain and forget all about Chicago.""
They hit three more stores. At each one, Oliver selected items that served dual purposes. A watch with a hidden cavity. Designer trunks with false bottoms. Everything Leslie would need to be the perfect smuggler's wife.
""She knows what you're planning?"" Andrea asked as they loaded boxes into his Bentley.
""She thinks we're expanding the family business."" Oliver's smile was cold. ""Which we are. The Wells own judges from here to Miami. We own the streets. Together...""
""You'll own everything.""
""Now you're getting it."" He started the car. ""One more thing. Leslie's been asking questions about us. Our history.""
""Tell her the truth. We had a thing. It meant nothing. End of story.""
Oliver's knuckles whitened on the steering wheel. ""That's exactly what I told her.""
He drove her back to her penthouse in silence. As she moved to get out, he caught her wrist.
""Next Saturday. The Drake Hotel. Nine sharp.""
Andrea looked at where he touched her. Once, that hand had known every inch of her. Now it felt like a stranger's.
""After this, we're done. No more wishes. No more favors.""
""After this,"" Oliver agreed, ""you'll never have to see me again.""
She pulled free, grabbing the packages he'd bought—all of them needing Duncan specialists to add special modifications before delivery.
""Andy."" His voice stopped her. ""Wear the silver dress. The one from New Year's.""
""That dress is ruined now.""
""Then wear something else nice. Leslie wants photos for her Instagram.""
Andrea closed the door firmly behind her.
In her apartment, she called her father. ""The Keith party next week. I have to go.""
""What's he holding over you?""
""Grandfather's last wish."" The words tasted bitter. ""The third one.""
A long pause. Then: ""Antonio always did like that boy too much. I'll have the jet ready. The moment you're done—""
""I'm gone. Barcelona can't come fast enough.""
Andrea poured herself a drink, staring out at the Chicago skyline. One more week. One more performance. One last favor for a dead man's promise.
Then she'd vanish into Barcelona's shadows, leaving Oliver Keith to build his empire on someone else's foundation.

Chapter 6
The Drake Hotel ballroom glittered with Chicago's deadliest dressed in their finest. Andrea entered through the side door, wearing a black Versace gown that covered her shoulder scar. Her Glock 19 rested against her thigh, hidden by designer fabric.
""Andrea!"" Oliver's mother, Eleanor, swooped in for air kisses. ""You look beautiful. Oliver said you might not come.""
""Couldn't miss his birthday."" Andrea's smile felt painted on.
The room was packed with crime royalty. The Torrelli brothers held court near the bar. The Rossis clustered by the windows. Every major family represented, all here to kiss the ring of the Keith-Wells alliance.
Andrea spotted Oliver near the stage, Leslie attached to his arm like a designer accessory. The pink Birkin bag hung from her elbow—the one Andrea had picked out for drug runs disguised as shopping trips.
""Ladies and gentlemen!"" Oliver's father took the microphone. ""Thank you for joining us on this special night.""
Andrea accepted champagne from a passing waiter, already knowing what came next.
""We're here not just for my son's birthday,"" the elder Keith continued, ""but to announce a union that will change Chicago forever.""
The crowd murmured excitedly. Andrea drained her glass.
Oliver took the stage, Leslie beside him in a white dress that probably cost more than most people's cars. He looked powerful up there. Untouchable. Nothing like the boy who'd held her hair during her first hangover.
""The Wells and Keith families are officially joining forces,"" Oliver announced. ""Leslie has agreed to be my wife.""
Thunder erupted—applause, cheers, the sound of an empire being born. Andrea watched Leslie flash her ring, the same one from the hospital garden.
That's when she smelled it. C4.
""Bomb!"" Andrea shouted, but her voice drowned in celebration noise.
The explosion ripped through the north wall. Plaster rained down as guests screamed, diving for cover. The lights went out, emergency systems kicking in.
A second blast hit the bar. Bottles exploded in sheets of alcohol and flame. In the chaos, Andrea saw Oliver moving—not randomly, but with purpose. He tackled Leslie, covering her body with his as debris fell like deadly snow.
Andrea dove behind an overturned table as gunfire erupted. Muzzle flashes in the dark. Someone was using the bombing as cover for a hit.
She pulled her Glock, muscle memory taking over. Two shooters by the kitchen doors. Another near the stage. They wore masks, but she recognized the movement—Colombians, here for revenge.
Andrea dropped the kitchen shooters with clean headshots. The third swung toward her, spraying bullets. She rolled left, feeling heat as rounds chewed up the floor where she'd been.
Then something hit her from above. A massive chandelier, loosened by the explosions, crashed down. The edge caught her ribs, driving her to the ground. Pain exploded through her chest.
Through tears and plaster dust, she saw Oliver hustling Leslie toward the exit. His security formed a protective diamond around them. He never looked back.
Andrea struggled to breathe, ribs screaming. The remaining shooter approached, rifle raised. She fumbled for her gun, knocked somewhere in the fall.
A shot rang out. The shooter dropped. Tony Duncan, her cousin, materialized from the smoke.
""Jesus, Andy. You okay?""
""Get me out,"" she gasped.
Tony hauled her up, half-carrying her through the ruined ballroom. Bodies everywhere. The Torrelli brothers down. Judge Martinez's wife bleeding out by the windows.
In the parking lot, ambulances wailed. Tony loaded her into their armored SUV as cops swarmed the scene.
""Oliver?"" she asked, hating herself for caring.
""Gone. Got his princess out first thing."" Tony's voice was bitter. ""Left everyone else to die.""
Andrea laughed, tasting blood. ""Of course he did.""
At Duncan Medical, X-rays showed three cracked ribs. Lucky, the doctor said. Could have punctured a lung.
Andrea stared at the ceiling, counting water stains. Twice now. Twice Oliver had chosen Leslie while Andrea bled.
Her phone buzzed. Unknown number.
""You okay?"" Oliver's voice.
She hung up and threw the phone against the wall, watching it shatter.
Some lessons you only needed to learn twice.

Chapter 7
The Tunnel was Chicago's worst-kept secret—an underground club where made men went to drink and deal. Andrea's farewell party was in full swing, the bass shaking bottles behind the bar.
""To Barcelona!"" Her cousin Tony raised his shot glass. ""May Spanish men appreciate what Chicago threw away.""
The crowd roared approval. Andrea smiled, playing the part. Tomorrow, she'd be gone. Tonight, she was still Duncan royalty.
She excused herself to the bathroom, ribs still aching from the Drake Hotel incident. Three weeks had passed. The Colombians were all finished, Oliver's retaliation swift and brutal. The Keith-Wells engagement was the talk of the underworld.
Coming back, Andrea took a wrong turn in the dimly lit corridors. Voices drifted from a private room, the door slightly cracked.
""—can't believe you're marrying that ice queen."" She recognized the voice. Marcus Keith, Oliver's younger brother.
""Watch your mouth."" Oliver's growl made her freeze.
""I'm just saying, Andrea's worth ten of her. You know it, I know it, hell, all Chicago knows it.""
Andrea pressed against the wall, heart hammering.
""Andrea was convenient,"" Oliver said, each word clear and cutting. ""A useful piece on the board. Good in bed, better in a fight. But Leslie? She's the key to everything.""
""You loved Andy—""
""I loved what she could do for me."" Oliver's laugh was ugly. ""But you don't build an empire on feelings, little brother. The Wells have European connections we need. Andrea's just another soldier. Replaceable.""
""That's cold, even for you.""
""That's reality. Andrea served her purpose. Kept me company while Leslie was gone. Now?"" A pause. Andrea heard him lighting a cigarette. ""Now she's a loose end heading to Spain. Perfect solution.""
""And if she heard you talking like this?""
""She'd what? Cry? Run to daddy?"" Another harsh laugh. ""She's been wrapped around my finger since we were kids. A Duncan princess who thought sharing my bed meant something. Pathetic.""
Andrea's vision blurred. She bit her hand to keep from making a sound.
""The best part?"" Oliver continued. ""She actually thought I'd choose her over Leslie. Like I'd throw away an empire for some girl who already gave me everything for free.""
""Jesus, Oliver.""
""What? It's true. Why buy the cow when the milk was free? Leslie understands her worth. Makes me work for it. Andrea just... gave it all away. Desperate for any scrap of attention I threw her.""
The voices faded as they moved deeper into the room. Andrea stumbled away, Oliver's words echoing in her skull.
Useful piece. Replaceable. Pathetic.
She made it to the alley before losing her dinner, champagne burning her throat. Her hands shook as she called her driver.
""Miss Duncan? The party—""
""Get me out. Now.""
Back at her penthouse, Andrea destroyed everything with methodical precision. Photos from their trip to Vegas—the shredder. His clothes left in her closet—the incinerator. The necklace he'd given her for her twenty-first—down the garbage disposal.
By dawn, every trace of Oliver Keith was gone from her life.
Her phone rang. Her father.
""Jet's ready. We moved up the timeline.""
""Why?""
""Word is Oliver's planning something. Using our routes to move product without cutting us in. Can't have you here when it goes down.""
Andrea laughed, brittle and sharp. ""Let him. I'm done being a useful piece on anyone's board.""
""Baby—""
""One hour. I'll be at O'Hare.""
She hung up, looking around her empty apartment one last time. Five years of memories, reduced to ash.
Andrea Duncan was leaving Chicago. What emerged in Barcelona would be something else entirely.
Something without mercy.
Something without weakness.
Something that would never again mistake physical intimacy for love.

Chapter 8
Andrea left The Tunnel at 3 AM, head still spinning from Oliver's words. The valet brought her BMW around, but something felt wrong. The street was too quiet, even for this hour.
""Miss Duncan?"" A man approached from the shadows, dressed in torn clothes, reeking of cheap whiskey. ""Spare some change?""
Her hand moved to her concealed Glock. Three more ""homeless"" men emerged, surrounding her car. Their eyes were too clear, movements too coordinated.
""Leslie sends her regards,"" the first one whispered, lunging forward.
Andrea rolled left, glass shattering where her head had been. She swept his legs, driving her heel into his throat. The second attacker grabbed her from behind. She threw her head back, feeling his nose crunch, then spun and put two rounds center mass.
The third man had a knife. Andrea caught his wrist, twisted until bones snapped, then used his own blade to finish it. The fourth tried to run. Her shot dropped him at twenty yards.
Four bodies. Four witnesses to Leslie Wells' jealousy.
Andrea's hands shook as she called her cleanup crew. This wasn't random. This was a message.
Thirty minutes later, she stood in Leslie's penthouse, blood still on her designer dress. Leslie sat on her white couch, playing shocked.
""Andrea! What are you doing here?""
""Cut the act."" Andrea's voice was ice. ""Your boys are being scraped off Wacker Drive.""
Leslie's mask slipped, revealing the snake beneath. ""I don't know what—""
""Four men. Your father's old soldiers. Did you really think I wouldn't recognize them?""
""Prove it."" Leslie stood, chin raised. ""Go ahead. Tell Oliver I hired men to remove his little toy. See who he believes.""
Andrea stepped closer. Leslie stumbled backward—right into her own coffee table. The sharp corner caught her temple as she fell, blood flowing dramatically.
""Help!"" Leslie screamed. ""She's trying to kill me!""
The penthouse door burst open. Oliver rushed in, taking in the scene—Andrea standing over a bleeding Leslie.
""She attacked me!"" Leslie sobbed, crawling to Oliver. ""She said I stole you, that she'd kill me before the wedding!""
Oliver's face went dark with rage. He positioned himself between them, hand on his weapon.
""Andy. Step back.""
""She hired men to kill me tonight. This is theater—""
""STEP BACK!""
Andrea had never heard that tone from him. Pure violence, barely controlled.
""Four bodies on Wacker Drive,"" she said quietly. ""Your girlfriend's cleaning crew. Check the surveillance—""
""Get out."" Oliver's voice was deadly. ""Get out of Chicago tonight, or I'll handle you myself.""
""Oliver, listen—""
He drew his Sig Sauer, pointing it at her face. ""You have six hours. If I see you after sunrise, if you come near Leslie again, I'll put you in the ground myself. Duncan or not.""
Andrea stared down the barrel of the gun held by the man she'd loved for five years. His hand was steady. His eyes were cold.
""Ollie,"" Leslie whimpered, playing up her injury. ""I'm scared.""
""It's okay, baby."" He didn't lower the gun. ""She's leaving. Forever.""
Andrea backed toward the door, hands visible. ""When you find out the truth—""
""The only truth is you're jealous and dangerous. Should've seen it coming."" His finger moved to the trigger. ""Five hours, fifty-eight minutes.""
Andrea left without another word. In the elevator, she called her father.
""Pack everything. We leave tonight.""
""What happened?""
""Oliver Keith just declared war.""

Chapter 9
The Duncan mansion was chaos. Men loading trucks, shredding documents, erasing twenty years of Chicago history in hours. Andrea moved through it like a ghost, Oliver's gun still imprinted in her memory.
""Transport leaves in thirty,"" her father said, burning files in the fireplace. ""Your mother's already at the airport.""
Andrea nodded, packing her grandfather's journals. Everything else could burn.
Her phone buzzed. Their inner circle was gathering at Rossi's restaurant for an emergency farewell. The underworld had rules—even in exile, respect must be paid.
The private room was packed. The Rossis, the Torellis, even Judge Martinez. Everyone except the Keiths.
""This is unexpected,"" old man Rossi said carefully. ""The Duncan family leaving Chicago... it changes everything.""
""Oliver Keith changes everything,"" Andrea's father replied. ""We won't stay where we're not valued.""
Knowing looks were exchanged. Everyone had heard about Andrea and Oliver. Most assumed this was a lovers' quarrel that would blow over.
They were wrong.
""Barcelona will be lucky to have you,"" Torelli raised his glass. ""To the Duncans—Chicago's loss.""
They drank, but Andrea tasted only bitterness. Twenty years of loyalty, erased because Leslie Wells played victim.
Her cousin Tony pulled her aside. ""You sure about this? Oliver's hot-headed, but he'll cool down—""
""He pointed a gun at my face."" Andrea's voice was flat. ""Threatened to bury me himself. There's no cooling down from that.""
Tony's face darkened. ""Then he's a fool.""
By 5 AM, they were at O'Hare's private terminal. Andrea stood on the tarmac, looking at Chicago's skyline one last time. The city that made her, that broke her.
She pulled out her phones—three of them. The official Duncan line. Her personal cell. And the encrypted phone only Oliver had the number for.
One by one, she destroyed them. Sim cards snapped, batteries removed, pieces scattered. The laptop with their shared files—wiped and hammered to pieces. USB drives with years of messages—burned in a trash can.
""Andrea."" Her mother appeared at the jet's door. ""It's time.""
Andrea took one last look at her phone fragments scattered on the concrete. Five years of late-night texts, coordinates for meets, ""I need you"" messages sent between jobs. All gone.
She climbed the stairs, not looking back.
As the jet lifted off, Andrea watched Chicago shrink below. Somewhere down there, Oliver was probably waking up beside Leslie, satisfied his threat had worked.
He'd find out soon enough. The Duncan routes through Canada—closed. Their warehouse contacts—gone. Twenty years of shared intelligence—evaporated.
The Keiths had just lost their most valuable ally.
And Oliver had lost something more.",1,1760594697.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False

1o7yfyk,https://i.redd.it/zkw1akqazevf1.jpeg,Google has announced plans to open a $15 billion Ai hub in India. Can this propel India to global AI leadership? Click to Read,"“Google to invest $15 billion in an AI hub in India.” It caught me off guard for a second. My coffee went cold because, honestly, I kept thinking how far India has come since the startup boom of 2015. This isn’t just another office complex; it’s potentially a global shift in where AI minds gather and grow.  

It feels massive, almost personal.  

Imagine thousands of engineers walking through those glass corridors in Bengaluru, talking about neural networks, ethical AI, or maybe just arguing over coding bugs between cups of filter coffee. I’ve seen this kind of energy before in small co-working spaces near Koramangala where ambition feels louder than the traffic outside. If Google’s hub fuels that same spirit, India could absolutely stand at the center of AI’s next revolution. But there’s a catch. Infrastructure, data ethics, and talent retention these aren’t small challenges. Many bright graduates still chase Silicon Valley dreams because the ecosystem here, though improving, can be unpredictable. For India to lead globally, we’ll need smoother collaboration between academia, startups, and government. And yeah, a little less bureaucracy wouldn’t hurt either.  

Still, I can’t shake off the optimism.  

A $15 billion bet means trust trust in Indian brains, in Indian code, in the messy but beautiful chaos that somehow works. The world might soon look at India not just as the IT hub, but as the AI heart that beats faster than anywhere else.

Everyone already has their little cliques and friend groups, and it’s like they have this invisible “no new members” rule.

I’ve tried joining in, talking to people in class, going to events, even hanging out a few times but I always end up feeling like I’m intruding rather than being included. It’s not like anyone is mean or anything, it just feels like there’s already a rhythm and I’m the awkward extra trying to blend in.

And then I hear about how guys bond so easily like one day they meet, talk about a car or a video game, and suddenly they’re best friends for life?? Meanwhile I’m over here struggling to find someone to grab a coffee with without feeling like I’m third-wheeling their entire friend group 😩

Is anyone else dealing with this? How do people actually make solid friendships in uni that don’t feel one-sided or surface-level? 

I’m in my 3rd year now and honestly, I thought I’d have a solid group by now but nope. So yeah, if anyone else feels the same or just wants to be friends, hit me up 🥺",2,1760594393.0,umanitoba,3,1.0,False

I keep finding a lot of these little bugs around the kitchen, almost 2-3 every day. They are usually located near my coffee or tea, but aside from walking on the coffee bag (beans) they are not found in the coffee or tea bags. I switched the coffee type, but not the shop, in case it helps.

They are about 2mm in length and walk quite fast. Haven't seen them flying or jumping. Usually brown, like coffee. Maybe it's this a **sawtoothed grain beetle** (like [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oryzaephilus_surinamensis))

Location: Eastern Europe, Romania.

Can someone please identify this creature for me? Any help would be appreciated - I've had enough of them and what to find the source.",1,1760594282.0,whatsthisbug,0,1.0,False
1o7ydni,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1o7ydni/i_am_a_paranormal_research_agent_this_is_my_story/,"I am a Paranormal Research Agent, this is my story. Case #001 ""The bus to Nowhere""","My name is Elijah Wiltburrow. I've been advised that I'll need to redact certain things from this statement, not that many of you would believe a lot of this. I don't mean to insult you all, but most people don't seem to take anything paranormal with more than a grain of salt, maybe at most something to believe in for the thrill of believing that something is out there. Well, there is.

At the time of this story, I had been newly hired by an organisation that specialises in the study of the paranormal. I can't say the name of the organisation for obvious reasons, but I was drawn to it for two very important reasons.

The first reason is that I have always been drawn to the paranormal. Growing up, I was fascinated with ghost stories and read all I could on the subject. This later blossomed into me studying parapsychology, which leads me to my second reason for joining this organisation. It is very difficult to get a job when you're primarily a scholar of a defunct field of study. ""Debunked"" isn't technically the word I'd use.

It's real. I knew it at the time, and I sure as hell know it now, but that's not the point of this statement.

My friend and fellow field research operative, Lily Heinz, had accompanied me on my first job assignment. Now, Lily Heinz is a psychic. I think this is important to clarify now before we continue.

She had an episode a few months prior to this case and was “scouted” by the organisation. I use those quotation marks because it was really an ultimatum: work for them or… well, I think you can fill in the rest.

She hadn't been a particularly powerful psychic in the time I had known her, but she was aware enough to sense when some paranormal energy was around. A helpful tool in our line of work.

Now this was my first case of my career, and I didn't really know what to expect. I mean, when you are told that there is a likely paranormal bus picking people up in the middle of the night, well, it kind of kicks any expectations out of your head.

We sat inside of Lily's car; the cold night air was thick, and a fitting, almost comical fog had swept in a few hours previously. Her car's heater had died a few weeks previously, so we both sat in an awkward silence wearing our heavy puffer jackets, struggling to stay awake.

We were parked on the side of one of the few roads entering the small mining town of \[REDACTED\], the street itself wasn't anything special, just a gravel road and high trees.

A few hundred feet down from us was a single street lamp with a bus sign hanging off it; the lamp was off. We both watched the street lamp with unwavering concentration; the dossier I was given for this case had explained that from the hours of 11 pm to 4:35 am a mystery bus would come and pick up hitchhikers.

And so here we are, waiting at 1 am for a bus or something to show up. I remember feeling a certain excitement from all of this; I'm pretty sure it's the only thing that kept me awake. Lily was less enthused. This was our second night surveying the site, and last night we hadn't gotten anything. She was quick to say that this was likely just another local legend that we could log as a ""myth"" in the paperwork, but the rules are the rules, we have to survey a site for at least two weeks if the paranormal entity or object doesn't abide by time regulations.

""Looks like we have someone,"" she said. Her words broke my concentration on the street lamp, and I raised the camera I had with me and zoomed in on the figure. It was a woman wearing a heavy jumper and what looked like a backpack. A runaway, maybe?

As she got closer to the street lamp, I looked at lily, she winced her eyes and looked at me.

""There is definitely something here, Elijah,"" she said with tension.

""How can you tell?"" I asked, but as I said this, the street lamp suddenly lit alight, the bus sign illuminated, and a small bench that I hadn't seen in the dark sat underneath it.

""Shit,"" I blurted out before I grabbed the door handle, but she grabbed my shoulder and held me back.

""We have to watch, this is our job, rookie,"" Lily said to me sternly.

The woman cautiously walked up to the bench and took a seat. She sat there for a few minutes, and we watched, took photos and notes, all protocol. After at most five minutes, I heard an engine coming from behind us. I looked in the rear-view mirror and saw two bright lights approaching from the distance.

An old transit bus pulled up, and the women and the sign were obscured from view. I took some photos, and Lily looked like she was concentrating on something; she had her eyes closed and hand slightly outstretched towards the bus. After a minute, the bus's engines came back to life and drove away, and the street lamp turned off. Lily pressed her foot down, and the car began to wheel out off the side of the road and follow the bus, but after five or so minutes, the bus was gone. It didn't vanish like a ghost or melt away; it just simply disappeared.

She got out of the car and grabbed something out of the trunk, then she walked towards the side of the road and stabbed something into the dirt; it was a GPS pin. a portable tracker that, when turned off, left a pin on your GPS, helpful for when you're tracking things in the middle of nowhere in the middle of the night.





We drove back to \[REDACTED\] and stayed in an old motel. It was just before 2 in the morning when I dropped like a tonne of bricks onto the bed. I drifted to bed immediately and awoke to the sound of knocking on the motel room door. I shot up and walked over to the window, looking out onto the walkway outside the door, and saw Lily standing there in a pair of jeans, a black button-up and her red hair tied back into a ponytail.

I looked at the alarm clock next to my bed, and it read 10.

""Shit!"" I remember saying before I opened the door. Lily looked at me and smiled.

""The best thing about working cases at night is that you can sleep like hell through the day. Enjoy it; soon you won't be able to sleep much at all,"" she said before placing a cup of coffee in my hand. I didn't even realise she was holding one. I took a sip and let the warm, beautiful sensation of coffee flood my empty stomach.

""You smoke?"" she asked while holding a box of cigarettes in her offhand.

""Ehh, no,"" I said awkwardly, and she shrugged before lighting one up.

She looked at me inquisitively. She leaned back on the table that sat opposite the end of my bed, and I sat on the bed, coffee in one hand and my head in the other.

""So what did we see last night?"" she asked.

I looked at her confused.

""The… bus?"" I said, genuinely confused, which made her sigh.

""Yes, the bus. What do you think it was?"" she said. I got the impression that she wasn't asking and that this was a test, and so I focused on what I had learnt leading up to this. Even before I was hired by the organisation, I had studied stuff like this for years.

""Well, the bus itself is clearly odd, it doesn't show up on any transport schedule or follow any routine, and yet it knew when that woman was there. It must be parked nearby or—"" My concentration broke. ""Shit, that woman. Has there been any news of her?"" I asked.

""Yes and no. Betty James was reported missing a few hours ago, and from what it looks like, she was running away from home, just like the others,"" she said before taking another swig of her smoke.

""Plus, the rate of people running away is significantly higher here than anywhere else in the surrounding areas, probably related, but I'm not sure how,"" she continued.

""And are we sure this thing is paranormal? Maybe it's just a coincidence."" I felt stupid for asking.

""Rookie, trust me, this is definitely paranormal. I got a feeling."" That feeling she got was what I'd later learn was her own paranormal awareness.

""Ok, so what's our next move? We can't keep watching, we know next to nothing about this thing,"" I said.

""I agree, we need eyes on this thing,"" she said with a malicious grin. The air in the shitty motel room suddenly grew thick as I realised what she was asking.

""You must be joking; I can't go on that thing. We don't even know where it goes.""

""You're right, we don't know dick besides where it disappears and what times it appears. Don't worry, I'm not sending you alone, I'll be coming with,"" she said and threw the smoke bud into the drain of the sink in the small kitchen.

""Till then, write down your notes and statement on last night's events, and try to rest up for tonight,"" she said whilst walking out of the room. She gave me a mischievous look when I realised that she gave me coffee when I definitely don't need the caffeine. Say what you will about Lily and her ""arrangement"" with the organisation, but she definitely knew how to make a joke in any situation.





After a day of tossing and turning, trying and failing to fall asleep, I eventually had to get up and get ready for work. It was 8 pm, and the night air was crisp. Lily drove us out to a diner on the edge of town, and I immediately ordered myself a black coffee.

""Didn't sleep well?"" Lily asked with a smile that said she was genuine but with a look that said she knew the answer.

""Surely I can report you for this,"" I said jokingly, although a part of me was genuinely interested in following this up. She laughed, and after a moment my coffee arrived. I took a sip, and Lily lifted a small backpack off the ground and onto the table.

I can't go into the specifics, of course, but imagine a ghost-hunting survival kit. The closest thing I can compare it to is shark hunting with a spear. Sure, you can harm the shark, but the chances of it harming you are still far too high once you're in its waters, and tonight we were diving right in.

A few hours later we pulled up to the side of the road across from the bus stop, the same spot as last night. We both got out, photographed the bus stop and walked over. The light for some reason didn't turn on when we approached, but we both had torches and a small wind-up lamp that had some power to it.

We waited for what felt like hours as we sat at the bus stop, and eventually, to what felt like our luck, the light lit up.

""Something is definitely here,"" Lily said, and as I looked at her, she held two fingers against her left eyebrow, as if there was tension there.

""Ehh, hello?"" A voice said from the left of us. I look over, and a young man, maybe 19, was standing there with a large bag and a puffer jacket. Shit, it wasn't waiting for anyone; it was waiting for people running away.

""Hey bud, how are you?"" I said in the friendliest tone I could, which I now realise would've been extremely unnerving considering the circumstances. I was only a few years older than this guy, and I tried to seem as natural as possible.

""I'm… good,"" the runaway said whilst still standing a few metres away.

""Elijah, heads up,"" Lily said silently after she placed a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and she nodded her head towards the distance where two headlights shone towards us.

""So what brings you out of town? Going on a trip?"" I said as naturally as I could. Lily later told me that I weirded even her out.

""N-no… I just need to get out of this town, y'know,"" he said after a long moment.

The bus passed me and Lily and stopped directly in front of the runaway. This thing really had a target, but we both jogged over to the runaway and lined up behind him. The runaway was the first to enter, and after he stepped on, the door tried to shut but stopped midway through before slowly opening again, almost like it was reluctant to let us on.

We stepped up the steep metallic steps, and I tried to get a look at the bus driver, but from all I could see in the very dark bus was that he wore a typical bus driver uniform and sunglasses. He made no moves to greet or even acknowledge us. Lily was behind me, and after walking slowly down the aisle, I sat on the middle left-hand side of the bus, a few seats down from the runaway, and Lily sat across from me.

Besides our already established caution and scepticism, I felt like this place was really off. The bus was humid, and a sour smell hung in the air; it smelt almost like meat, but I couldn't place what animal.

The bus's engine came to life slowly, and it began to wheel down the lone country road towards \[REDACTED\].

""Elijah, stay focused; we need to take notes on what this thing is,"" Lily said before taking out her notebook and writing some notes. I reached into my bag and grabbed my camcorder.

The camcorder struggled to turn on. I now know that paranormal events and entities create a type of dead zone for technology or at the very least interfere with it greatly.

I was too distracted by the camcorder to realise that it was approaching until it grabbed hold of my shoulder. The bus driver held onto me, and I felt its fingers sink into me.

I looked up and saw its face staring down at me. Well, I looked at where its face should be; what was there was nothing. I need to stress that it wasn't flat like a smooth option; I mean, there was a hole where its face should be, and inside was a void.

""FUCK,"" I screamed. ""LILY,"" I continued, and as I looked at her, I realised she had her fingers on her forehead. She looked like she was in pain but was focused. I put my left hand on the bus driver's hand, trying to shift it off, and with my other hand I dig into my bag, looking for something.

I pulled out a small plastic bag filled with small white crystals. I opened the bag with my right hand and pushed it into the bus driver, which caused it to flinch back in pain and let go of my shoulder. Silver halide, or ""silver salt"", is like kryptonite to most paranormal creatures.

The creature made a hissing noise and fell back into a chair. I jumped out of the chair, and the adrenaline propelled me towards the driver's seat to try and pull the brakes, but it wouldn't budge.

I looked back towards the back half of the bus, and I noticed the hitchhiker; she was clearly dead. Her eyes were white and milky, and her skin was pale and thin.

""How did it get to him so quick?"" I thought, and I quickly looked back at the bus driver, and it stood up out of the chair and shrieked at me. It was next to Lily but completely ignored her, which meant I was in danger, real danger.

This was the moment that I realised what type of work I was in; it wasn't just going to sites and checking urban myths, it was standing in front of things that shouldn't exist and just trying to survive.

It leapt at me, and I shielded my arms out in front of me. I heard a metallic slam, and I opened my eyes to see it wriggling on the floor. I looked over at Lily and saw her hand outstretched towards the creature, and her eyes were rolled back.

""ELIJAH, USE THE RUNESTONE."" She yelled at me before throwing a cloth sack at me. I nodded my head and reached into the sack and grabbed a small stone pebble that had a rune etched into it. I had always been good with the study of languages, so when I saw the rune etched into the stone, I remembered what the intent was. I slammed it against the bus door and shouted “útlagr!”, an old Norse word meaning “banish”. When said with intent with this runestone, you can temporarily banish things not from our plane.

As I said this, my surroundings suddenly turned to mist, and I fell hard on some gravel. I had rolled for a few feet and was convinced that I had broken my shoulder; I held onto it and groaned. I looked around and saw Lily a few feet away.

""You okay?"" she asked. She held onto her ankle, and when I looked down at it, I realised that it must've twisted in an unnatural way.

""I'm fine. What the hell was that?"" I asked in between shallow breaths.

""A Lophiiformes-type entity. You're lucky; this was one hell of a first case, rookie,"" she said before laying back and breathing hard. What she did on the bus took a lot out of her, and she was close to passing out completely.





I called in to our higher-ups, and they dispatched some backup. A few hours before dawn, we had six people on the site surveying the bus stop. Before long, it was exorcised, and all that stands there now is a bus bench along an old country road.

I got chewed out for using a runestone. For those who don't know, runestones are incredibly rare; almost all of them can be traced back to an incredibly powerful witch in eighth-century Norway who created a couple thousand. How Lily was able to get her hands on one is beyond me, but without it, I'm convinced we'd be dead.

Lily got chewed out for putting us in that situation; her relationship with the organisation is different from mine. For them, I am an employee, but for her, it's a lot stricter. She wasn't fired and was allocated to the role of my partner indefinitely, which still stands today.

For those of you still reading, I thank you. You might be wondering why I am writing this and why I am interested in publicising some of my work if it means it would be censored. Simple. I think I am going to die. Something is hunting me, and it has for some time now, and as a scholar, I wish for some trace of my work to be out there.

Anywho, I advise all who are still reading to please stay away from any thoughts of suddenly wanting to run away in the middle of the night and to especially stay away from any bus stops on the edge of town. You may very well just be prey. ",2,1760594249.0,scarystories,0,1.0,False

The light for some reason didn't turn on when we approached, but we both had torches and a small wind-up lamp that had some power to it.

We waited for what felt like hours as we sat at the bus stop, and eventually, to what felt like our luck, the light lit up.

""Something is definitely here,"" Lily said, and as I looked at her, she held two fingers against her left eyebrow, as if there was tension there.

""Ehh, hello?"" A voice said from the left of us. I look over, and a young man, maybe 19, was standing there with a large bag and a puffer jacket. Shit, it wasn't waiting for anyone; it was waiting for people running away.

""Hey bud, how are you?"" I said in the friendliest tone I could, which I now realise would've been extremely unnerving considering the circumstances. I was only a few years older than this guy, and I tried to seem as natural as possible.

""I'm… good,"" the runaway said whilst still standing a few metres away.

""Elijah, heads up,"" Lily said silently after she placed a hand on my shoulder. I looked up at her, and she nodded her head towards the distance where two headlights shone towards us.

""So what brings you out of town? Going on a trip?"" I said as naturally as I could. Lily later told me that I weirded even her out.

""N-no… I just need to get out of this town, y'know,"" he said after a long moment.

The bus passed me and Lily and stopped directly in front of the runaway. This thing really had a target, but we both jogged over to the runaway and lined up behind him. The runaway was the first to enter, and after he stepped on, the door tried to shut but stopped midway through before slowly opening again, almost like it was reluctant to let us on.

We stepped up the steep metallic steps, and I tried to get a look at the bus driver, but from all I could see in the very dark bus was that he wore a typical bus driver uniform and sunglasses. He made no moves to greet or even acknowledge us. Lily was behind me, and after walking slowly down the aisle, I sat on the middle left-hand side of the bus, a few seats down from the runaway, and Lily sat across from me.

Besides our already established caution and scepticism, I felt like this place was really off. The bus was humid, and a sour smell hung in the air; it smelt almost like meat, but I couldn't place what animal.

The bus's engine came to life slowly, and it began to wheel down the lone country road towards \[REDACTED\].

""Elijah, stay focused; we need to take notes on what this thing is,"" Lily said before taking out her notebook and writing some notes. I reached into my bag and grabbed my camcorder.

The camcorder struggled to turn on. I now know that paranormal events and entities create a type of dead zone for technology or at the very least interfere with it greatly.

I was too distracted by the camcorder to realise that it was approaching until it grabbed hold of my shoulder. The bus driver held onto me, and I felt its fingers sink into me.

I looked up and saw its face staring down at me. Well, I looked at where its face should be; what was there was nothing. I need to stress that it wasn't flat like a smooth option; I mean, there was a hole where its face should be, and inside was a void.

""FUCK,"" I screamed. ""LILY,"" I continued, and as I looked at her, I realised she had her fingers on her forehead. She looked like she was in pain but was focused. I put my left hand on the bus driver's hand, trying to shift it off, and with my other hand I dig into my bag, looking for something.

I pulled out a small plastic bag filled with small white crystals. I opened the bag with my right hand and pushed it into the bus driver, which caused it to flinch back in pain and let go of my shoulder. Silver halide, or ""silver salt"", is like kryptonite to most paranormal creatures.

The creature made a hissing noise and fell back into a chair. I jumped out of the chair, and the adrenaline propelled me towards the driver's seat to try and pull the brakes, but it wouldn't budge.

I looked back towards the back half of the bus, and I noticed the hitchhiker; she was clearly dead. Her eyes were white and milky, and her skin was pale and thin.

""How did it get to him so quick?"" I thought, and I quickly looked back at the bus driver, and it stood up out of the chair and shrieked at me. It was next to Lily but completely ignored her, which meant I was in danger, real danger.

This was the moment that I realised what type of work I was in; it wasn't just going to sites and checking urban myths, it was standing in front of things that shouldn't exist and just trying to survive.

It leapt at me, and I shielded my arms out in front of me. I heard a metallic slam, and I opened my eyes to see it wriggling on the floor. I looked over at Lily and saw her hand outstretched towards the creature, and her eyes were rolled back.

""ELIJAH, USE THE RUNESTONE."" She yelled at me before throwing a cloth sack at me. I nodded my head and reached into the sack and grabbed a small stone pebble that had a rune etched into it. I had always been good with the study of languages, so when I saw the rune etched into the stone, I remembered what the intent was. I slammed it against the bus door and shouted “útlagr!”, an old Norse word meaning “banish”. When said with intent with this runestone, you can temporarily banish things not from our plane.

As I said this, my surroundings suddenly turned to mist, and I fell hard on some gravel. I had rolled for a few feet and was convinced that I had broken my shoulder; I held onto it and groaned. I looked around and saw Lily a few feet away.

""You okay?"" she asked. She held onto her ankle, and when I looked down at it, I realised that it must've twisted in an unnatural way.

""I'm fine. What the hell was that?"" I asked in between shallow breaths.

""A Lophiiformes-type entity. You're lucky; this was one hell of a first case, rookie,"" she said before laying back and breathing hard. What she did on the bus took a lot out of her, and she was close to passing out completely.





I called in to our higher-ups, and they dispatched some backup. A few hours before dawn, we had six people on the site surveying the bus stop. Before long, it was exorcised, and all that stands there now is a bus bench along an old country road.

I got chewed out for using a runestone. For those who don't know, runestones are incredibly rare; almost all of them can be traced back to an incredibly powerful witch in eighth-century Norway who created a couple thousand. How Lily was able to get her hands on one is beyond me, but without it, I'm convinced we'd be dead.

Lily got chewed out for putting us in that situation; her relationship with the organisation is different from mine. For them, I am an employee, but for her, it's a lot stricter. She wasn't fired and was allocated to the role of my partner indefinitely, which still stands today.

For those of you still reading, I thank you. You might be wondering why I am writing this and why I am interested in publicising some of my work if it means it would be censored. Simple. I think I am going to die. Something is hunting me, and it has for some time now, and as a scholar, I wish for some trace of my work to be out there.

Anywho, I advise all who are still reading to please stay away from any thoughts of suddenly wanting to run away in the middle of the night and to especially stay away from any bus stops on the edge of town. You may very well just be prey. ",1,1760594123.0,stories,0,1.0,False

Is tested and reviewed dozens to find the best.

# What to Look For in a [Coffee Maker Under $100](https://gomehedi.com/best-drip-coffee-maker-under-100/)

Here, I will explain in plain terms the features and criteria you should use when judging coffee makers in this price class.

# 2.1 Key Criteria & Features

|Feature|Why It Matters|What to Aim For / Acceptable Trade-offs|
|:-|:-|:-|
|**Brewing Temperature**|Coffee extracts best when water is 195–205 °F (90–96 °C). Too cool → bland brew. Too hot → burnt flavor.|In sub-$100 models, aim for machines that reach \~195 °F or more. Some cheaper ones fall short. [Serious Eats+1](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-inexpensive-coffee-makers-5219420?utm_source=chatgpt.com)|
|**Ease of Use / Simplicity**|A simple machine means fewer things break, and you will actually use it every day.|Big buttons, few controls, clear instructions.|
|**Capacity / Size**|Between how many cups you often brew and how much space you have on counter.|If you brew for 1–2 people, a 4–6 cup machine is fine. For families, 10–12 cups is better (but harder under $100).|
|**Reservoir & Water Tank**|Removable tanks are easier to fill; fixed ones sometimes force you to carry the whole machine to the sink.|Removable tanks are ideal, but fixed ones are okay if the opening is large.|
|**Carafe (Coffee Pot) Type**|Thermal carafes keep coffee hot without a hot plate; glass + hot plate is simpler and cheaper.|Under $100, many will use glass + warming plate. If you see a thermal carafe in this range, that’s a bonus.|
|**Additional Features**|Timer / auto-brew, brew strength settings, pause & pour etc.|Good to have, but don’t pay heavily for them. Simple is better.|
|**Durability & Brand / Support**|Even a cheap machine is only good if it lasts.|Look for known brands, decent warranty, good user reviews.|

# 2.2 What You Can’t (Usually) Get Under $100

Because of price constraints, some features common in premium machines will rarely appear under $100. Be aware:

* Built-in grinders
* Precise temperature control with PID
* High steam pressure / full espresso capabilities
* Very large capacity (beyond 14 cups)
* Highly polished finishes or premium materials

Knowing what’s unrealistic helps you avoid frustration.

# 2.3 Voices from Experts & Tests

* The **Serious Eats** team tested nine inexpensive coffee makers, focusing on ease, reliability, and flavor. They found that machines that reach or exceed 195 °F produced better taste. [Serious Eats](https://www.seriouseats.com/best-inexpensive-coffee-makers-5219420?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* One user in a forum put it simply:“My cheap Mr. Coffee never got water hot enough, and the hot plate was poor.” [Bogleheads](https://www.bogleheads.org/forum/viewtopic.php?t=177040&utm_source=chatgpt.com)
* Consumer Reports includes models under $50 in their tests, proving that even very budget machines can compete in convenience. [Consumer Reports+1](https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/coffee-makers/best-coffee-makers-under-50-dollars-a3767225848/?utm_source=chatgpt.com)

These observations confirm that smart selection—rather than just brand or style—makes a big difference.

# 2.4 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Buying

* How many cups do I brew per day?
* Do I want to set it at night and wake up to coffee?
* Do I care about thermal vs glass pot?
* Do I have room and how big can it be?
* How much importance do I place on “extras” (pause-fill, strength setting etc.)?

Answering these helps narrow choices.

Let me describe a few of them in more detail.

# Black+Decker CM4000S

This is one of the recommended “best under $50” models by Consumer Reports. [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/coffee-makers/best-coffee-makers-under-50-dollars-a3767225848/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) It offers:

* 12-cup brewing
* Programmable timer
* Simple controls and ease of use

Its downside: the reservoir markings are faint, so filling precisely is harder. [Consumer Reports](https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/coffee-makers/best-coffee-makers-under-50-dollars-a3767225848/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) But for many users, this is still a winner in this price range.

# Hamilton Beach 12-Cup Programmable 49465R

This model provides:

* A full 12-cup output
* A programmable timer / “wake up brew”
* Auto shutoff (so you don’t leave it on all day)

It’s a reliable, no-frills pick. It won’t produce gourmet coffee, but it gives dependable performance for many.

# Cuisinart Models (Brew Central, PerfecTemp)

Cuisinart tends to be a trusted brand in coffee makers. Their DCC-1200 and DCC-3200 models often appear on “best under $100” lists. [Consumer Reports+1](https://www.consumerreports.org/appliances/coffee-makers/best-coffee-makers-under-100-dollars-a5127740207/?utm_source=chatgpt.com) They score well in brew performance and usability. The DCC-3200, in particular, gives high capacity and include features like adjustable brew strength.

# 3.2 Comparison Table & Rankings

Here’s a comparison among some of the key picks:

|Rank|Model|Best For|Approx Price\*|Key Strength|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|1|Black+Decker CM4000S|All-rounder, budget|\~$40–$60|Dependable, good size|
|2|Cuisinart PerfecTemp 14 Cup|Families, large volume|\~$90–$100|High capacity, good brew|

|4|Bella Pro 90061|Simplicity & ease|\~$50–$80|User friendly|
|5|Mr. Coffee 12-Cup|Basic, very cheap|\~$25–$50|Ubiquitous, easy to find|

\* Prices are rough U.S. market ranges and may vary in your country.

Rankings are based on balancing brew quality, features, and value for money.

# 3.3 Pros & Cons — What You Gain and What You Give Up

**Pros:**

* You can brew 8–12 cups in many of these — suitable for families or gatherings.
* Most models use standard drip method — familiar, simple, easy to use.
* You avoid paying for premium extras (grinder, espresso pressure etc.).
* Repairs and parts are more affordable than for high-end machines.

**Cons / compromises:**

* You won’t get “espresso” quality — pressure and crema are not in scope.
* Hot plates may overheat coffee if left on too long.
* Materials (plastic, glass) may be less robust.
* Fewer safety, design, or luxury features.

If your expectations match what is possible in this price range, you’ll be happy.

# Buying Tips, Maintenance, and Final Advice

In this final section, I'll share practical tips—things you may not see in product descriptions—and help you make a confident choice.

# 4.1 Before You Buy: Things to Check (Checklist)

* Check water reservoir opening: can you pour water in easily?
* Is the detachable tank removable?
* Does it come with a good carafe handle?
* Are controls big and clear?
* How easy is it to clean? (especially lid, filter basket)
* Look for warranty (6–12 months is common) and availability of spare parts.
* Read user reviews—especially complaints about leaks, overheating, weak brews.

# 4.2 Setup & First Use Tips

1. **Rinse before use** — run a brew cycle with just water to clean any manufacturing dust.
2. Use a standard-size coffee filter (check paper vs permanent filter).
3. Use fresh, medium-ground coffee — very fine or coarse grinds may cause issues.
4. Don’t overfill the basket — follow capacity markings.
5. If there’s a “pause & pour” feature, avoid pulling the carafe mid-brew too often.

# 4.3 Daily Use Tips

* Use the “freshest beans” you can buy (or freshly opened bag).
* Clean filter basket daily (remove old grounds).
* Wipe any spills, especially around the warming plate.
* If machine has “strength” or “bold” setting, test which your taste prefers.

# 4.4 Descaling & Maintenance

Over time, minerals in water accumulate (scale) and reduce performance. Here’s how to maintain:

* Descale every 1–3 months (depending on water hardness) using white vinegar mixed with water (e.g. half vinegar, half water).
* Run a full cycle with the mixture, then run 2–3 cycles with plain water to rinse.
* Clean lid hinges, water inlet, carafe lid, etc.
* Replace filters (if your model uses water filter cartridges) when recommended.
* Don’t leave stale coffee in carafe all day; it damages taste and parts.

# 4.5 Tips for Best Coffee Taste

* Use filtered water (if your tap water has strong taste).
* Use correct coffee-to-water ratio: a common rule is **1 to 2 tablespoons coffee per 6 oz water** (adjust to taste).
* If brew seems weak, try a finer grind, or use “bold” mode (if available).
* If coffee tastes bitter, reduce brew time or try a coarser grind.

# 4.6 Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

* **Overfilling** the coffee basket → leads to overflow or weak brew
* **Letting water sit** too long before brew → stale taste
* **Ignoring scale** → ruins machine efficiency
* **Using wrong filters** (size mismatch) → leaks, drips
* **Leaving warm plate ON all day** → burns coffee, shortens life

# 4.7 A Simple Interview-style Tip

I recently spoke (imagined) with a user, “Sara,” who said:

>

That tells me: **value matters more than just lowest price**.

Another user, “Ravi,” said:

>

So for your life style, features like timer or auto-brew may matter more than brand.

# 4.8 Final Advice: How I Would Choose if I Were You

If I were in your shoes today:

1. Pick a reliable brand (Black+Decker, Cuisinart, Hamilton Beach, etc.).
2. Focus on usability (clear buttons, ease of filling).
3. Prefer a model that reaches \~195 °F or more in tests or reviews.
4. Accept glass + hot plate unless thermal pot appears at a bargain.
5. Use the machine gently, clean and descale regularly.

# Conclusion & Call to Action

You don’t need an expensive machine to enjoy a good cup of coffee. Even under $100, you can find a reliable, easy-to-use brewer that gives you satisfying results—if you choose wisely and care for it.

* Remember: prioritize temperature, simplicity, ease of cleaning.
* Avoid overpaying for features you won’t use.
* Read real user reviews and complaints.
* Maintain the machine regularly.

1o7y9y6,https://www.reddit.com/r/writers/comments/1o7y9y6/another_lovely_night_looking_for_honest_feedback/,Another Lovely Night - Looking for honest feedback (Don't hold back),"# 1. Awake

Awake, suddenly, consciousness.

And with it the Craving. This was the third night since my last Feeding. I needed to Hunt tonight.

As with every evening, I spent a couple of minutes listening to the surroundings of my makeshift sleeping pod.

Once I was sure that no one was around, I undid the padlock on the inside of the Cargo Carrier. It was essentially a large - human-sized - container that typically fits on a car’s rooftop. Much more inconspicuous than a coffin, and something that is not out of place within a repurposed car garage - my current home.

Pulling the chain holding the carrier closed, I winced as it rattled against the hooks I’ve screwed inside its walls.

“I might as well rise with an evil laugh with this much noise.” I mattered to myself as I opened the lid.

The interior of the garage was dark and I could make out only the shape of objects. To my right, I could see the looming mass of the tall metal shelves I’ve placed between the carrier and the entrance. Their outline, further distorted by the heavy duty tarp I’ve hanged behind them. With a first look it should give the impression that the entire space ends behind the shelves. At least I hoped it would.

Even though it’s already been two years since my Turning I still haven’t gotten used to the vulnerability of the Slumber. The death-like state that all those of the Blood enter, the moment the Sun rises above the horizon.

Satisfied that I was alone, I turned on the flashlight of my phone charging next to the carrier.

You’d think that as a vampire I would be able to see in the dark. You’d be wrong. Dark vision is a power that one of the undead could develop but doesn’t really come with the standard-package. Immortality, enhanced strength, unnatural resilience. Those are perks all Leeches get. Of course these come with a catastrophic vulnerability to sunlight and a singular dependence on mortal blood.

Thinking of which, sent another tremor of the Hunger clawing inside. The constant and undeniable force that the longer you deny, the stronger it becomes. It’s the thing that damns us and turns us all into the one thing we really are - monsters. No matter how much I wanted to avoid it, I would have to feed tonight, lest I risked losing control.

I got up and turned sideways to go through the space between the shelves and the garage wall to get to the entrance.

I had spread several boxes and other large objects within the space. An old refrigerator, a broken down bicycle and even a store clothing rack with old pieces of clothing. They were meant to give a feeling of long-term, even forgotten storage.

I’ve turned my phone back on from airplane mode and navigated through the maze of junk.

As I bent to unlock the wide garage door my phone chirped. It was a text in one of the encrypted messaging apps.

My heart sank - figuratively, since it wasn’t beating anymore. It was from the Nomarch, the highest representative of Olympus and ultimate authority of vampiric law within the City.

It wasn’t like her to send me texts. Could I have done anything to get me in trouble? Did I make a mess in my last Hunt? No. I left the mortal in a daze but well. He should remember nothing more than taking a shortcut through the park after an evening out in the town.

I felt my muscles tense as the Hunger clawed deeper, strengthened by the fear. In an effort to calm down, I opened the text. No use freaking out over possibilities.

“Perhaps she just wants to say hi” I thought sarcastically.

*Meet in downtown office. 21:00.*

My shoulders relaxed a bit. An invitation to a meeting was not the usual way violators of the Laws were handled. Getting disappeared into the night and then reappearing for one final performance in a public execution was more typical.

Not that a meeting with the Nomarch was ever a normal affair. The two or three encounters had left me shaken and terrified.

A cold stillness started spreading through me. Downtown at nine was going to be difficult. There was no way I was ever going to make it to that meeting on foot, let alone having enough time to hunt. I’d have to use public transport to be there on time. And the gnawing of the Hunger down my spine made putting on the Visage - a semblance of life back to my undead features - a risky gamble.

I picked an old sports coat from the clothing rack. It was a cyclist’s jacket with a hood meant to go over a bike helmet. I hoped that the over-sized headpiece would allow me to go through the tram ride without attracting attention or needing to use my already low blood reserves.

I locked the garage door behind me. With the large hood drawn well over my head I broke into a run to catch the next tram from the closest stop. It seemed that I was going to have another lovely night.

# 2. The Ride

There weren’t many passengers in the tram at this hour. And typical of the City, they had arranged themselves in a way to leave the most space between them. I had found a single seat which allowed me to have my head below my jacket’s cowl turned towards the window.

Discreetly, I took stock of the passengers in the immediate area around me.

In the seat in front of me there was an older lady with a beat-up shopping trolley and shabby clothes. Despite her worn appearance, her gray hair was arranged in an elaborate braid that was then turned into a halo. She was bending forward in her seat fidgeting with one of the trolley’s wheels. Trying to fix something that should be replaced. She clearly had seen better days. The position exposed the right side of her neck over her jacket’s collar. The straining made the muscles bulge slightly pronouncing the arteries.

Surprised, I noticed my hand on the edge of her seat. With a silent motion I withdrew it in my pocket digging my nails in my palm until the urge receded. I cursed myself for slipping, then forced my gaze elsewhere.

To my left across the aisle, on a set of seats facing each other, there were two men of darker complexion. They looked tired and were both deeply absorbed in their phones. I recognized the brand of shoes that one of them had on - standard issue for the employees of one of the large fast-food restaurants. I had worn the same when I had moved to the City to study for my Masters. They were likely immigrants going for the night-shift in one of the twenty-four-hour open businesses down town.

Satisfied that none of the commuters were interested in their surroundings I turned back towards the window. All I had to do was ride it out...and stay in control.

The crowd changed minimally as the rough structures of the industrial district gave way to the Period Buildings of Old Town - the financial hub of the City. It wouldn’t be long now. A few more stops and I would reach my destination. I allowed the tense muscles in my hands to relax a bit, as the tram made a smooth stop in a street lined with bars and late night coffee-shops.

A wild haired man entered through the sliding doors a couple of rows in front of me. He wore a white and red sports coat that was too large for him and his sneakers were scuffed and dirty. He smelled of stale cigarettes and almost spilled the large beer can he was holding as the tram resumed its journey.

He steadied himself with a curse in the German dialect of the region and started to loudly complain against an offense he took with a bartender - presumably from one of the bars he had visited tonight. His eyes darted wildly from one face to the next, clearly looking for someone - anyone - to direct his anger at. For their part, the rest of the passengers did their absolute best to escape his attention.

Regardless, he stumbled his way towards the lady sitting in front of me, going on a tirade about the outrageous alcohol prices of some establishments. The older woman, possibly experienced in this kind of interactions, kept her demeanor admirably. She had both her hands squarely on the handle of her beat-up trolley and her gaze fixed downwards, giving no indication that she heard any of it.

Realizing that he was getting nowhere with the old lady, he scanned around searching - almost hungrily - for another target. He moved to my side and grabbed one of the tram’s roof handles.

I could smell the lingering sweat on his clothes infused with the strong scent of alcohol. I wondered how much there was in him. I had heard that a vampire could get a buzz if they fed on a drunk enough mortal.

“*Maybe...I should give it a try*.” a seductive voice that wasn’t mine whispered in my ear. The hair on my neck stood up and all the muscles across my body tensed. The Hunger was tempting me again. I gritted my teeth and resisted the urge.

In the window’s reflection, I could see him watching me, trying to decide if he could get my attention. This wasn’t good. I couldn’t afford getting tangled with a drunkard if I wanted to lay low. Both for my sake and his. With my hood pulled low and body turned towards the window, I stayed absolutely still - being dead made it easier. He stood there swaying back and forth. I counted the seconds in my mind. One. Two. Three. Finally, I let out a breath I didn’t need as he turned shakily towards the men across the aisle.

“And what do you boys have to say?” he yelled slurring his words.

I turned slightly to my left to have a better view. The two men, already wary of the drunk man, were doing their best to appear absorbed in their phones.

Undeterred he continued. “Is this why you left your country and came to this place?”

“Where did you come from? Somewhere from Latin America?” he pointed to the fast-food worker spilling a bit of the beer he was holding in his hand as the tram took a wide turn.

It seems that his rowdy manner managed to earn him a glance from the poor man, because he got more agitated.

“Yes, I am talking to you!” he said leaning forward, hanging unsteadily from the roof handle with his left arm.

The tram got out of the turn and the change in course within the wagon caused a jerk to the opposite side. The drunk fool violently span around the roof handle he was still holding onto, bumping into me and spilling a good amount of his beer on my jacket.

“Shit!” he cried out. “I made a mess. Let me sort you out.” and proceeded to clumsily wipe my jacket with the back of his sleeve.

At his touch, I felt my fangs instinctively extend as the red tide inside me swelled. Without thinking, I batted his hand away. A rhythmic thrum had started in my ears as I sat still.

It took him a moment to understand what had happened.“Well, excuse you! I was only trying to help. There’s no reason for that!”

The thrum became more resonant. My mind raced. Why did this have to happen? Why now? I couldn’t deal with him as I was. Not here. Not in this well lit tram; and certainly not with onlookers being present. I couldn’t get the phones of the night-shift workers out of my head. A video or photo post on social media, of “Drunk fighting Weird-looking guy in Tram”, would be enough to spell my doom.

“Hey! I am talking to you! Do you think yourself too good to answer me?” he said aggressively.

The sides of my head now throbbed as then thrum’s intensity increased. No, I had to put on the Visage if I wanted to get out of this. But the Visage demanded blood. Precious blood that I had in short supply. And I’d have to deal with the Hunger. And this was already difficult and painful. No, I had to do it. I had to resist and hide my nature.

“Well I’ll show you!” he growled and place a hand on my shoulder.

The thrum became faster and more resonant. “*This is pathetic”* I thought enraged. “*Why the hell am I hiding from this lowlife? How dare he touch me? Doesn’t he know that he only lives because I allow it?”*

My spine was now vibrating in sync with the buzzing in my head. I realized that this was his pulse I could hear - no - feel through the air. “*Listen to the blood go through his veins. Take in its exquisite scent as it courses beneath his skin, making possible his worthless existence. Yes. This fool has no idea what he is in for. He is a sheep that stepped in the wolf’s path. IT is food.*”

I shot to my feet. The motion put the drunk man off-balance and he took a step backwards. In a blur I grabbed his shoulder and closed the distance between us. I lowered my hood. I could see the look of confusion in his unshaved face, as his alcohol addled brain was straggling to register what was happening.

“I’m sorry sir,” I grinned politely “It seems, I had dozed off and didn’t hear you.”

“What? This?” I pointed to the beer stain on my jacket. “Don’t worry about this. It’s only beer and this is a water-proof jacket. I’m sure that it will come right off.”

Behind him, in the window’s reflection a man in his late thirties, wearing a cyclist’s jacket with an over-sized hood was smiling back at me. He had dark, slightly thinning hair, a trimmed beard and olive skin that had the healthy tinge of someone that spent his time in the sun.

Then man looked at me dumbfounded, taken aback from a reaction he did not expect.

“You seem to have had a rough night. Why don’t you take my seat? I was going to get off anyways.” I said and guided him with my hand still grabbing his shoulder.

He stumbled and fell awkwardly on the tram’s chair. “Yes. Ahem.... thank you. I did have a rough night. And sorry about that.” he said finding back his voice.

The atmosphere in the wagon became lighter as the situation deescalated. The rest of the passengers relaxed and went back to what they were doing.

After a few seconds, the tram came to a halt at the next stop. It wasn’t far from the Nomarch’s office and I could make it there on time.

I got off and let the cold night air cool me, as the Hunger thrashed and raged against its leash.",2,1760593855.0,writers,1,1.0,False

3. My protein intake as per chatgpt is about 140g but Im having something close to 40-50g per day. I need to increase it so Im thinking of having 2 scoops of protein. Does that make sense? How do you guys take care of the protein deficit?

EDIT: Okay I agree what I am doing is not OMAD. But definitely inspired by lot of posts I read here.

If you’re a founder, indie hacker, or consultant who still builds MVPs in coffee shops, congratulations — the plot just thickened.

Let’s be blunt. This is not about better uptime for your 0.01% user adoption product. It’s a capital move to put the keys to global AI capacity into the hands of firms that can underwrite entire continents’ GPU supply chains. Want to spin up a model that eats petabytes and demands top‑tier networking? Someone just bought the playground.

Why this matters to you:
- Cost structure will change: With capital that big flowing into data centers, expect preferential pricing, reserved capacity, and enterprise deals that make indie hosting look quaint.
- Time to market becomes access to capital: It’s less about the clever algorithm and more about who can buy or prebook the space and chassis to run it.
- Consulting arbitrage appears: Consultants who can translate enterprise wants into deployment plays will be paid handsomely to bridge startups and these new infra owners.

But don’t panic. There’s always opportunity in consolidation.

If the big houses control capacity, micro‑players can specialize. Think optimization stacks, cost tools, model compression services, migration wranglers, or regional edge plays that dodge the global giants’ attention. Indie hackers should stop trying to out‑GPU the market and start out‑clevering it with product differentiation and unit economics.

And for the skeptics who mutter about megacorps and centralization: yes, it’s a power play. But power concentrates, markets fragment. With central infra comes predictable APIs, bulk discounts (for some), and a whole ecosystem of vendors who will monetize the margins the giants don’t care about.

Final take: It’s a new phase of the infrastructure arms race. For founders and consultants the playbook shifts from “build the best model” to “secure the best runway and partnerships” — or build something the giants can’t swallow without changing their entire ROI math. In short: adapt, niche, or partner. Or keep shipping tiny, delightful products that don’t need an entire data center to validate.",1,1760593396.0,AiKilledMyStartUp,0,1.0,False

I literally couldn't continue the discussion and ended up blocking him
  
 Over our time together, the term Master Manipulator was thrown around sometimes but only when referring to me. I am very intelligent, and I know how to manipulate people. It's not something I am proud of or anything I do often. But after a recent discovery, my ex is quite the Manipulator himself. 
   
  He was such a great manipulator that he was able to hide his true self our whole relationship.  Two and a hafe years together, and I was none the wiser. 
I have always lived by the rule, of let them do what they want to do, so you can see what they'd rather do. Okay, so I never checked his phone, I never inquired about things that weren't brought up, I blindly trusted him. He gave reassurance anytime I needed, simply handing me his phone to go through if I felt the need to check him. I never went through with it. He had a way about it all that I would just hand it back and say thank you with relief. None of my exes ever reassured me so effortlessly and willingly before. 
  
 One morning, over coffee, I told him that I had watched a reel the day before, and it said, "" If you really want to see where his mindset is, check his for you page"". Simple enough, right? I have never seen anything in his phone, so I asked him. 

The first time ever, he denies me. Well obviously thats not going to work for me. So I waited till that night and after he fell asleep, I went through his phone. 
 The panic flooded over me instantly. I couldn't believe what I was finding. I didn't want to believe he was that person. Everything you can imagine other girls pics and vids saved, porn, only fans, dms to and from different girls, inquiries for hookers. I was hurt, shocked, and so betrayed. 
 
The following morning, I informed him that I had gone through his phone and he needed to come clean about everything. I didn't tell him all I knew, I wanted him to be honest and accountable. 
It took him a total of FIVE days to confess everything, and im almost positive there's more he didn't come clean about. The last day of confessions was the worst. He told me while we were together, but he was out of town for work he considered and negotiated with two or three different hookers, ultimately not going through with it. He said that they couldn't come to an agreement. Like I believe that. 
   
Tonight through was horrible. 
Somewhere along the line, I became a villain. 
It was my fault. Him doing these lustful acts was always a result of something I made him feel. 
He doesn't want to talk about the gaslighting or the false reassurance he's been giving me for two years. He doesn't want to address the disrespect I've been receiving from him or the many lies. Nope, it's my fault. 
   
Clearly, I know better. The manipulation skills he showed me tonight would have blown his cover a week or two ago. But now I just see through it, and it's sad. We could have maybe worked things out. I am a reasonable woman. But you can't make it work with a man who dont see his lust as a problem, even worse, a man who denies or hids it. This doesn't really capture the stupidity and the lack of luster manipulation skills. But the pathetic attempt to blame shift was ugly. 
 
  Anyone ever finally see someone for who they really are, and just be disappointed and totally disgusted? 
Almost kind of with yourself for being together with someone of that caliber of human being...",1,1760593395.0,ToxicRelationships,0,1.0,False

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div>Small barndominiums have become increasingly popular for those seeking affordable and innovative housing options. These unique structures blend rustic charm with modern style, making them ideal for anyone from young couples to retirees. If you’re considering building a small barndominium, there are numerous design ideas that can help you create an inspiring space without breaking the bank.

### Open Concept Living

One of the best features of small barndominiums is the open concept layout. This design maximizes space and creates a welcoming atmosphere. Here are some tips to consider:

- Use large windows to allow natural light to fill the space, making it feel larger.
- Choose multifunctional furniture that can serve multiple purposes, such as a sofa bed or a dining table with storage shelves.
- Incorporate movable partition walls to create flexible living spaces that can adapt to your needs.
 
### Rustic Charm

To maintain the authentic feel of a barndominium, consider incorporating rustic elements into your design. These not only add character but can also be quite affordable:

- Use reclaimed wood for flooring, beams, or accent walls.
- Incorporate metal accents, such as light fixtures or railings, to enhance the barn-like aesthetic.
- Choose a neutral color palette with splashes of earthy tones to create a cozy atmosphere.
 
### Efficient Space Planning

Space can be tight in a small barndominium. Therefore, planning is essential. Think creatively about how to utilize every inch:

- Built-in furniture, such as benches with storage, can help save space while providing functionality.
- Create vertical storage solutions by installing shelves high on the walls to hold books or decorative items.
- Consider a lofted bedroom or storage area to free up valuable floor space below.
 
### Cost-Effective Materials

Building a small barndominium doesn’t have to be expensive. Choosing the right materials can greatly influence your overall costs:

- Steel framing is often more affordable than traditional wood and provides durability.
- Metal roofing is both economical and energy-efficient, ensuring long-term savings on heating and cooling costs.
- Look for budget-friendly siding options like pole barn panels, which are cost-effective and easy to maintain.
 
### Energy Efficiency

Modern designs allow for greater energy efficiency in small barndominiums. These strategies not only help with the environment but also reduce utility bills:

- Install high-quality insulation to keep your home warm in winter and cool in summer.
- Incorporate solar panels to lessen your reliance on traditional power sources.
- Picking energy-efficient appliances can lead to significant savings over time.
 
### Outdoor Living Spaces

Don’t forget about the outdoor areas! Small barndominiums can benefit greatly from well-designed outdoor spaces:

- Consider a porch or deck that extends your living area outdoors.
- Create a small garden or landscaping to enhance curb appeal and add a touch of nature.
- Use outdoor furniture to create a relaxing area for gatherings or simply enjoying your morning coffee.
 
### Personal Touches

Make your small barndominium feel like home with personal touches:

- Display your favorite artwork or family photos on the walls.
- Add plants or greenery to bring the indoors to life.
- Incorporate colors and textures that reflect your personality and style preferences.
 
Small barndominiums offer an exciting and budget-friendly housing option. With innovative designs and creative planning, you can create a beautiful, functional space that meets your needs without overspending. Embrace the charm of barndominiums and turn your dream home into a reality!

</div>Understanding the Costs of Building Small Barndominiums: A Budget-Friendly Guide
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building a small barndominium can be a fantastic option for those seeking an affordable living space with unique charm. These structures, which blend the rustic appeal of barns with modern living accommodations, offer a practical and budget-friendly choice for many. Understanding the costs involved in constructing a small barndominium will help you plan effectively and ensure you stay within your budget.

### Key Factors Influencing the Cost

Several key factors influence the overall cost of building your small barndominium. It's crucial to consider these elements to get a clear picture of your financial investment:

- **Size:** The square footage directly affects the overall cost. Smaller designs will naturally be less expensive in materials and labor.
- **Location:** Zoning laws and building codes vary by region. Urban areas may have stricter regulations and higher costs than rural locations.
- **Materials:** The choice of materials can significantly impact your budget. Steel framing, for example, may cost more upfront but offers durability and longevity.
- **Labor:** Hiring a contractor can affect budget. DIY projects may save you money but require time and expertise.
- **Finishes:** High-end finishes like custom cabinetry and flooring will increase costs. Simple, standard options can keep expenses down.

### Estimated Costs

When you’re planning your barndominium, it's essential to have a breakdown of the potential costs involved. Here's a general overview:

- **Foundation:** $6,000 - $10,000 depending on materials and size.
- **Structure:** $50 - $100 per square foot is a typical estimate for framing.
- **Roofing:** $5,000 - $15,000 based on quality and materials.
- **Interior Finishing:** Expect to spend $20,000 - $50,000 for insulation, plumbing, electrical work, and interior design.
- **Landscaping:** Roughly $1,500 - $5,000 for basic outdoor work.

### Budget-Friendly Design Tips

Creating a beautiful small barndominium doesn’t have to come at a high price. Here are some budget-friendly design tips:

1. **Choose an Open Floor Plan:** Open concepts reduce the need for extra walls and materials, saving you money.
2. **Consider Prefabricated Options:** Prefab kits can significantly lower labor costs and reduce construction time.
3. **Opt for Standard Sizes:** Custom dimensions often lead to higher costs. Stick with standard sizes for doors and windows.
4. **Focus on Essential Spaces:** Build around your needs. Limit unnecessary rooms and prioritize important areas.
5. **Utilize Economical Finishes:** Many budget-friendly finishes are available that do not sacrifice style for affordability.

### Financing Your Barndominium

Financing your small barndominium is another step to consider in your budgeting process. Here are some common financing options:

- **Construction Loans:** These loans are customized for building properties and often convert to mortgages once construction is complete.
- **Traditional Mortgages:** Some lenders offer mortgage options for barndominiums, but you must meet specific requirements.
- **Personal Loans:** If you're doing a DIY project, personal loans can help cover expenses without the need for a large mortgage.

Understanding the costs associated with building small barndominiums is vital for making informed financial decisions. By considering size, materials, and design choices, you can create a budget that accommodates your needs while keeping costs manageable. Whether you choose to go with a contractor or take the DIY route, careful planning will help you achieve the barndominium of your dreams without breaking the bank.

### Conclusion

Building a small barndominium can be an exciting venture that combines style, functionality, and affordability. With innovative design ideas shaping these unique structures, you have the opportunity to create a space that truly reflects your lifestyle. Whether it's a cozy retreat or a modern living area, the possibilities are endless when you focus on designs that maximize space while remaining budget-friendly.

Understanding the costs involved in constructing your small barndominium is crucial for a successful project. By breaking down expenses associated with materials, permits, and labor, you can create a financial plan that helps you keep your dream within reach. With thoughtful budgeting and planning, it's possible to build a comfortable and stylish home without breaking the bank. This affordability opens doors to many individuals and families looking to invest in their own space.

Your journey toward a small barndominium doesn’t have to be overwhelming. With the right design ideas and a clear understanding of costs, you can create a home that fits your needs and budget. Embrace creativity and practicality as you explore various design elements that inspire you. Remember, the goal is to form a living environment that not only meets your needs but also offers a welcoming atmosphere for you and your loved ones. As you embark on this adventure, take pride in your ability to blend innovation with affordability, crafting a small barndominium that is uniquely yours.",1,1760593370.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

I am a girl (26), with no experience of dance classes or anything like that, but I love the look of swing dance and I think it would be really fun to learn. I would have loved if my boyfriend would do it with me, but he can't manage it time-wise at the moment.

So I am looking for someone who would be open to trying it with me and who would be ok to take the role of the guy ('leader' role in the dance). Maybe someone who also doesn't have much experience, but who is interested to try something new like this.

To be fully open though, I would be very hesitant to do this kind of class with a straight guy - I know of course it would probably be absolutely fine, but my boyfriend would be a bit uncomfortable with it, and I also wouldn't want to create any situations where there can be a certain vibe between two people. I hope you can understand this.

Anywayyyy, I have already found a class that is every week Tuesdays evening, based in north of Berlin. And we would have to pay upfront for 10 weeks.

So if anyone is interested, give me a message and we can discuss details and meet for a coffee or something!",0,1760593340.0,berlinsocialclub,2,0.5,False

I’ve been running into a frustrating issue lately when texturing my milk for latte art. Normally, when I pour the milk into the cup, I should be able to let it slightly “ride” on top of the espresso — especially when building that initial canvas. You know, like in those Lance Hedrick videos where the milk gently stacks up and you can pour above the rim without it immediately overflowing.

Lately, though, I’ve been getting almost no surface tension. As soon as I start pouring — especially near the edge of the cup — the milk just blends straight in and starts overflowing. Sometimes I get a nice silky canvas, but more often it just turns into a blurry milk-coffee soup.

Here’s my setup:

	•	Machine: Profitec Go
	•	Grinder: DF54
	•	Roasts: Light, medium, and dark (depending on the day)
	•	Pitcher: Small pitcher (I could use a bigger one, but that would mean wasting milk)
	•	Milk temp: I steam to around 138 °F

My gut feeling is that this is definitely a technique issue. I just can’t quite pinpoint what exactly I’m doing wrong. My first guess is that I probably need to introduce more air at the beginning — create a bit more volume before switching into the rolling phase.

Has anyone experienced something similar and figured out how to get that nice glossy, elastic microfoam with proper surface tension again? Any tips for refining stretching/rolling timing would be super appreciated ",1,1760593257.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

How do we approach?,"So my SIL (Sister in Law) moved in with me and my mother about a month and a half ago. She pays 600$ for a room downstairs to help us pay for the mortgage each month. During her time here she’s become really comfortable while I personally have felt uncomfortable with the lack of boundaries. It started with simple things, like my only thermos I own going missing and her coming back from work with it full of coffee that she was using from our pods. Over time we’ve tried to separate our things from hers and it’s been a little difficult to manage.

Fast forward to tonight, and my mother was exchanging laundry and found a pair of undergarments that looked very similar to the one she had, same size, color, brand. They are very unique undergarments that go under dresses to provide a slimmer look. They were supposedly stretched and had stains on them, and there were also men’s socks that she had in her basket that my mother believes might have been mine. At first I was thinking it was just our laundry piles getting mixed up but then I wonder how the undergarments suddenly turn up after weeks of being missing only to be found stretched from its small size and having a stain on it. 

How do we talk to her about this? I can’t confirm the socks are mine but it feels like there really isn’t any communication about these things and my mom is walking on eggshells around her just for the sake of having that little extra bit of money.",1,1760593230.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

This afternoon I got an update alert from the Audiofuse control center. I honestly didn't pay much attention - just hit OK and walked off to get coffee.

Now:

computer doesn't recognize the 16Rig - so I can't attempt a firmware reinstall.

No audio in or out

16Rig doesn't recognize the Keylab and Keylab won't even power on with USB connected to 16Rig

I can't turn the 16Rig off from the front panel

I can cut the power to it, but it comes right back up without a button press when power is back on, so I can't attempt a reset.

I've rebooted everything. Tried alternative cables. Uninstalled Audiofuse control center and reinstalled fresh. 

Panel is lit - encoder and switches work. But that's it. Non functioning.

1o7y1ua,https://www.reddit.com/r/homesolutions/comments/1o7y1ua/say_goodbye_to_clogs_reliable_merrick_drain/,Say Goodbye to Clogs – Reliable Merrick Drain Cleaning You Can Trust,"When it comes to home maintenance, one of the most common (and frustrating) problems homeowners face is a clogged drain. From kitchen sinks that back up during meal prep to slow bathroom drains that turn showers into shallow baths, clogs can throw off your entire routine. The good news? With a little knowledge and preventative care, you can avoid the headache altogether. And when prevention isn’t enough, you’ll know where to turn for reliable Drain Cleaning in Merrick.

This blog will discuss the primary reasons for clogs, helpful preventative measures, and the significant impact of having a qualified drain cleaning expert like Johnny Rooter on your side.

**Why Do Drains Clog in the First Place?**

Before learning how to stop clogs, it’s important to know why they happen. Drains work hard every day, carrying away water, food particles, soap scum, and waste. Over time, these substances build up and form blockages.

[](https://johnnyrooterny.com/bellmores-hydro-jetting-services-unleash-their-potential-for-excellent-drain-cleaning/)





**Common culprits include:**

* **Grease and Oil:** Cooking grease may look harmless when hot, but once cooled, it hardens into a sticky clog magnet.
* **Hair:** Bathrooms are especially vulnerable since hair easily tangles with soap residue to form knots.
* **Soap Scum:** Regular bar soap can leave behind film that narrows pipes.
* **Foreign Objects:** Kids’ toys, floss, or even “flushable” wipes often create hidden problems.
* **Mineral Buildup:** Hard water leaves behind deposits that gradually shrink pipe openings.

Knowing what goes down your drain is half the battle. The other half is building healthy habits.

**Smart Habits to Prevent Drain Clogs**

The best way to deal with clogs is to prevent them before they start. Here are some effective strategies:

**1. Use Drain Screens**

Placing a simple mesh strainer over sink and shower drains can catch food scraps, hair, and debris. Empty them regularly for best results.

**2. Dispose of Grease Properly**

Instead of pouring grease down the sink, let it cool in a container and toss it in the trash. This one step can prevent countless kitchen clogs.

**3. Flush with Hot Water**

Once a week, run hot water down your drains to loosen up minor buildups before they become stubborn.

**4. Be Cautious with Garbage Disposals**

Avoid fibrous foods like celery, potato peels, and eggshells in your disposal, as they often lead to jams and clogs.

**5. Switch to Liquid Soap or Body Wash**

They leave behind less residue than bar soap, reducing bathroom drain buildup.

**6. Educate the Family**

Sometimes, kids don’t realize that toys, wipes, or paper towels don’t belong in the toilet. A little education goes a long way.

**Natural DIY Drain Maintenance**

While chemical drain cleaners are tempting, they can corrode your pipes over time. Instead, try these natural, eco-friendly methods:

* **Baking Soda & Vinegar Flush:** Pour half a cup of baking soda followed by half a cup of vinegar down the drain. Wait 15 minutes and flush with hot water. This fizzing action helps break down buildup.
* **Boiling Water Rinse:** A quick pour of boiling water down the kitchen sink once a week can keep grease and soap from solidifying.
* **Salt & Baking Soda Mix:** Pour equal parts salt and baking soda into the drain overnight, then rinse with hot water in the morning.

These simple remedies can serve as regular maintenance, though they won’t always solve major clogs.

**When to Call the Professionals**

No matter how careful you are, some clogs are inevitable. Signs that it’s time to call a professional include:

* **Water Backing Up:** If your sink or shower fills instead of draining, the clog is already advanced.
* **Slow Drainage in Multiple Areas:** This could indicate a bigger issue in your main sewer line.
* **Unpleasant Odors:** Foul smells mean waste or food is stuck and decomposing.
* **Recurring Clogs:** If you’re dealing with the same problem repeatedly, a deeper cleaning is required.

At this point, DIY solutions often won’t cut it. That’s where professional [**Drain Cleaning in Merrick**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-cleaning/) becomes essential.

**Why Professional Drain Cleaning is Worth It**

Hiring experts not only solves the immediate clog but also prevents future ones. Professional services:

* Use advanced tools like hydro jetting and motorized snakes to clear stubborn blockages.
* Inspect your pipes with cameras to identify hidden problems.
* Provide long-lasting solutions, not just temporary fixes.
* Save you money in the long run by preventing costly pipe damage.

**Frequently Asked Questions About Drain Cleaning in Merrick**

**1. How do I know if my drain needs professional cleaning?**

If you notice slow drainage, gurgling noises, recurring clogs, or foul odors coming from your sinks or toilets, it’s a sign you need professional drain cleaning. These symptoms often mean that a blockage is forming deep inside your pipes.

**2. How often should I schedule drain cleaning for my home?**

For most households, scheduling professional drain cleaning once a year is a good preventive measure. However, larger families or homes with older plumbing systems may benefit from more frequent cleanings to avoid major clogs.

**3. Can chemical drain cleaners damage my pipes?**

Yes, chemical drain cleaners can corrode pipes over time and cause leaks. They might provide temporary relief, but they rarely solve the root cause of the clog. That’s why professional [**Drain Cleaning in Merrick**](https://johnnyrooterny.com/drain-repair-and-installation/) is a safer and more effective option.

**4. What’s the best way to prevent kitchen sink clogs?**

The key is to avoid letting grease, oils, coffee grounds, and fibrous foods go down your drain. Using a strainer to catch food particles and regularly flushing with hot water helps keep kitchen sinks flowing smoothly.

**5. Are “flushable” wipes really safe for toilets?**

Despite the label, most flushable wipes do not break down quickly and can cause major blockages in pipes and sewer lines. It’s best to dispose of them in the trash instead of flushing.

**6. Why should I hire Johnny Rooter for drain cleaning in Merrick?**

U.S. Your location can be anywhere.

I decided to come out with a new posts as I thought this would be a better guide and I hope this can be posted here as I mean this in a friendship way, but I'm pro mental health for men and if any men are looking for a female friend that needs someone as an emotional support or to pick your brain if you're having a bad time out there, you can always chat with me, it's fine.

I will say though, that just because I'm 33, you're in your early 20s and mid 20s you can still message me and I don't care if I've male friends at that age as I don't think me as a 33 year old making friends with early 20s and mid 30 years is weird.

However, before I close this I've received some very hateful chat requests messages that I would ask that would be stopped. Redditors complain that my posts are basically the same thing, which yeah haven't you heard? I'm an introvert. 


I'd do the same thing every single day because an introverted life is something that I want. I go outside every 5 days, because I've a mild phobia of people and the outside. There are sometimes where I only go out 7 days if I'm having a very bad day. 

However, please start calling my life a bot and not myself a bot. I'm sure there are Redditors that are here and get this because even though this is a ''friend.'' subreddit I'm sure there are some introverts living a semi-hermit lifestyle. 


However, making wild accusations that I'm a bot because I basically post that all I'm  doing the same thing  every single day which is cats, tea, energy drinks, sometimes coffee, Skyrim, music and YT is literally what my life is everyday with the cats. I'd nothing different and it'd very uncommon if my social anxiety isn't this stage is a prison that I will go to an event. 

Yeah, my life is basically a bot and myself isn't. I'm a real person with feelings behind a screen that feels emotion, music and connections on a strong level. Even if I want friendships that are online only right now doesn't mean I don't feel shit at all. That's just bull shit. 

I'd hope that I can find friendships here that can let me chat with them tonight because I'm really struggling with a lot of negative thoughts right now. 

I will ask this again, please stop commenting on my post if you've nothing nice to say and the same with my chat requests. 

With that being said my life is botting again, almost 1 something am, getting some wild berry tea, going on Skyrim on my PS4 and I've a cat with me. I would also  ask if your chat requests messages could be medium to long winded, keep me engaged, keep me interested, don't come up with something boring and basic.

I would rather prefer to have a pick up line from Sleep Token about our friendships, even though I'm looking for something more this is a friendship subreddit and things have to be kept that way and if you don't know Sleep Token then it's time do some homework 😂

Do they really deserve to be here? Did they really work hard for all of this?

Here come my thoughts...

You’ll hear people preach hard work, discipline, investing early, entrepreneurship… but they never mention the messy part that actually got them started.

Look deep into the stories of some of today’s billionaires, tycoons, or “self-made” moguls. You’ll find shady startup funding, insider favors, tax loopholes, backroom deals, political connections, stolen funds,  and whole mountains of gray money.

That guy relaxing on a superyacht? Yeah, he “invests,” sure , but his first big bag probably came from something that wouldn’t pass a background check. It is always a huge amount of money coming in all at once, or a 'deal' that will give them a huge amount over time and will give them a jumpstart into 'investing'

The world runs on clean stories built over dirty beginnings.

on hard floors, it does its job. picks up the daily dirt, mops up dried coffee and dog paw prints. but carpets? that’s where it falls short. it gets the surface crumbs, but anything deeper just laughs at it. corners and edges still gather dust, no matter how many times i send it back out.

my biggest frustration is how blind it gets without light. once the room’s dim, it’s basically guessing. it’ll dodge furniture just fine in daylight, then at night it acts like it’s never seen the place before  tangles itself in wires, bumps into chair legs, gets confused by shadows.

and yeah, it’s fast. too fast. it cleans like it’s late for something. even on two full cycles, it doesn’t feel thorough. i wish there was a mode where it noticed messier spots and slowed down, went over them again. that would make a huge difference.

the dock is great, i’ll give it that. it empties itself, washes and dries the mop, fills up the tank  that part actually feels premium. the mopping system, too, is better than the pad-style bots. it actually scrubs. but vacuuming? it’s mid-tier for the price.

and then there’s the app. man, i just don’t like it. it works, but it feels clunky and half-finished. the layout’s messy, the controls aren’t intuitive, and you can’t customize cleaning behavior the way you’d expect from something this expensive.

if your house is mostly hardwood, this thing makes sense. if it’s carpet-heavy or dark most of the time, it’s gonna frustrate you.

after a year, i’d give it a 7/10. i don’t regret buying it  it’s saved me time, and it does enough right to earn its spot. but it never blew me away. it’s one of those products that reminds you how close good and great really are.",5,1760591715.0,RobotVacuums,0,1.0,False

1o7xhrh,https://i.redd.it/4lvnkqo0pevf1.jpeg,Slow- living Morning Magic! Easy Practices For A Calm Morning.,"

Hey magic seekers! I’m absolutely fascinated by how a few small, intentional actions can transform the morning rush into a peaceful, magical opening to the day. It’s not about doing more; it’s about doing things slowly and mindfully.

We’re not looking for hustle culture's ""5 AM ice bath, 10-mile run"" routine. We’re looking for the simple, grounded practices that feel like a sacred pause before the world gets loud.
What makes a morning routine feel like a ""moment of magic"" for you?

I'll start with a few of my own little rituals for inspiration:

• The Intentional Brew: Instead of hitting a button, I've turned making my morning coffee into a full ritual (French press or pour-over). I focus on the scent of the grounds, the sound of the hot water, and the warm weight of the mug in my hands. It forces a mandatory 5-minute pause before I do anything else.

• Window Greeting: The very first thing I do (before touching my phone!) is open the window to let the cold or fresh air and natural light in. I take three deep, slow breaths. It's my tiny, daily practice of greeting the elements and letting nature set the tone.

• The Gratitude Sip: I keep a journal next to my favorite chair. While having that first warm drink, I just jot down three small things I'm genuinely looking forward to or grateful for that day. No deep existential thoughts required—just a deliberate focus on the good. 

Now, tell me yours!
Whether it's a specific tea you drink, a song you play, a movement you do, or a tech-free window of time:

They say okay hand me a $20 bill and their change ended up being $7.55. The guy then tells me he wants another mcveggie so I punch it then and then the change he got was used to pay for his sandwich. It was $6. So in total he only paid for 2 sandwiches. Well when he gets his order he starts complaining to me saying he's missing a sandwich. 

I get my manager and my manager tells him that he was only charged for 2 sandwiches not 3 and even takes his receipt and shows it to him. He starts raising his voice saying that we stole his money when we didn't and even kept saying ""ask her (me) ask her about it"" and I kept trying to tell the man I only charged him for 2 sandwiches. After 10 minutes they ended up coming back and my manager explains it to him and he says okay and leaves. My coworker did tell me when she went outside to do a curbside order she heard the guy still complaining. My manager did ask me what happened and I explained it to him and he said I did nothing wrong. He even reprinted the man's receipt and told me that I did infact only charge him for 2.

1o7xatz,https://www.reddit.com/r/marineconstruction/comments/1o7xatz/durable_beautiful_sustainable_discover_the_best/,"Durable, Beautiful, Sustainable — Discover the Best in Marine Construction Long Island","When the waves kiss the shore and the salt air carries the whispers of the Atlantic, you realize that life by the water is unlike any other. But behind the beauty of Long Island’s coastline lies a network of engineering brilliance — docks, bulkheads, and piers that make seaside living both safe and sustainable.

This is where the mastery of [**marine construction in Long Island**](https://www.southshoredocksinc.com/marine-construction/) comes into play. It’s not just about building structures; it’s about crafting connections between people, property, and the power of the ocean.

[](https://www.southshoredocksinc.com/our-services/)

**A Story from the Shoreline**

Meet the Callahans, a family who’d dreamed of transforming their bayfront property in Patchogue into a space for sunset gatherings and boat adventures. But nature had other plans — their old wooden dock was crumbling, and each high tide seemed to take a little more of their land.

When they reached out to [**South Shore Docks Inc.**](https://www.southshoredocksinc.com/), they weren’t just looking for repairs; they wanted peace of mind. The team walked the site, listened to their story, and designed a plan that balanced strength and beauty.

Within weeks, the Callahans’ property was transformed. Their new floating dock glistened in the sunlight, their shoreline protected by durable vinyl bulkheads built to withstand storms. Today, their evenings are filled with laughter, the soft hum of the sea, and the security of knowing their coastal dream is built to last.

“It’s not just a dock,” Mr. Callahan said, smiling. “It’s where memories begin.”

**What Makes Marine Construction So Unique**

Marine construction isn’t your average building job. Every project must battle the challenges of water, weather, and time. The structures built along the coast must be tough enough to handle waves and salt corrosion yet designed with an aesthetic that complements the beauty of the waterfront.

Here’s what sets it apart:

1. **Engineering Meets Environment** – Every construction must respect natural tides, soil conditions, and ecosystems.
2. **Durability is Non-Negotiable** – Materials are chosen not just for strength but for resistance to rust, rot, and erosion.
3. **Precision Planning** – Water adds complexity to measurements, stability, and permits — making experience essential.
4. **Aesthetic Balance** – While strength is key, marine construction also enhances the elegance and functionality of coastal properties.

**The Craft Behind the Construction**

Whether it’s a luxury marina, a private boat dock, or a retaining wall, marine construction requires an incredible blend of skill, machinery, and local knowledge.

* **Bulkheads** protect the shoreline from erosion and prevent property loss.
* **Docks and Piers** provide access to the water — whether for leisure, fishing, or boating.
* **Boat Lifts** keep vessels secure and prevent long-term damage from saltwater exposure.

Each project begins with site evaluation and design — a blueprint that ensures harmony between human needs and natural balance.

**Why Expertise Matters**

In a place as geographically diverse as Long Island, no two waterfronts are the same. Tidal patterns, soil types, and exposure levels differ dramatically — and so do the solutions.

That’s why working with seasoned experts in marine construction ensures every inch of the build is customized. The right professionals handle everything from permits and environmental assessments to structural design and safety testing.

It’s about more than construction; it’s about stewardship — protecting the coastlines that define Long Island’s identity.

**The Human Touch in Every Build**

What separates an average construction company from a trusted one is heart. The best teams don’t just see blueprints; they see families, livelihoods, and memories waiting to unfold.

From listening to homeowners’ dreams to ensuring every bolt and beam serves a purpose, true craftsmanship in marine construction is built on relationships.

That’s why so many property owners across the island turn to companies that blend technical excellence with genuine care — a hallmark of quality and trust that endures.

**The Challenges of Coastal Construction**

Working near or over water brings unique hurdles: unpredictable tides, unstable soils, and strict environmental regulations. These aren’t obstacles — they’re responsibilities.

Professional marine contractors embrace these challenges by using advanced machinery, corrosion-resistant materials, and cutting-edge installation methods that guarantee stability and longevity.

In short, it’s where innovation meets the ocean — and precision meets patience.

**The Role of Sustainability**

In today’s world, marine construction isn’t just about strength — it’s also about sustainability. Responsible builders use eco-friendly materials, respect marine habitats, and design projects that protect rather than harm coastal ecosystems.

From recycled vinyl sheet piling to minimal-impact installation techniques, sustainable construction ensures Long Island’s shores remain both functional and beautiful for generations to come.

**FAQs**

**1. What is marine construction?**  
Marine construction involves building or repairing structures near or in water — including docks, seawalls, bulkheads, piers, and boat lifts.

**2. Why is marine construction important in Long Island?**  
It protects coastal properties from erosion, enhances accessibility, and adds long-term value to waterfront homes and businesses.

**3. How long does a dock or bulkhead last?**  
With proper maintenance and high-quality materials, a well-built dock or bulkhead can last 25–50 years or more.

**4. What materials are best for marine construction?**  
Vinyl, aluminum, composite lumber, and treated timber are common choices for their durability and resistance to corrosion.

**5. Do I need permits for marine construction?**  
Yes, most projects require permits from local and state environmental agencies to ensure compliance with safety and environmental regulations.

**Building Dreams Along the Shore**

The Long Island coastline is a place where beauty and resilience coexist — and where expertly built marine structures keep that balance alive. Whether it’s protecting a home from erosion or creating a peaceful dock for morning coffee, the craftsmanship behind every marine project reflects both engineering skill and artistry.

So, if you’re dreaming of your own waterfront upgrade, perhaps it’s time to turn that vision into something tangible — something that lasts.

Curious about how your property could benefit from a custom marine solution? The experts who’ve spent decades perfecting the art of coastal construction are ready to help you chart the course.

After last week’s revelation of the new Halo 2 multiplayer maps from our friends at Certain Affinity, we thought it would be nice to talk about how the art for these beautiful new maps was actually created. Chris Wood, Art Lead at CA, talked at length with us, about the technique and talent poured into the maps.



**Was the intention for both maps to completely reimagine them visually or to pay homage to the originals?**

Desolation and Tombstone both came with their own set of interesting challenges. The goal here was to pay adequate tribute to the originals while still giving the visuals a complete and total makeover. It was an interesting balance. I threw around terms like “Warm Fuzzies"" and ""Goose Bumpies"" more often than I care to admit. Every day we thought about what hardcore Halo fans would think of our daily art decisions and incorporated those thoughts into our development process.

  
*This concept shot of Desolation shows the trees and mountains beyond the Forerunner structure.*  
  
  
**Derelict, while hardly logical, has a kind of symmetrical visual logic at least – did this translate into the choice of Forerunner architecture?**

Absolutely… The forerunner’s sleek and intersecting lines lent themselves so well to this map. It really came together quickly and we knew from the first moment that this environment would be Forerunner tech.



**While metallic and rigid in form, Desolation also incorporates organic themes – what was the process behind that thinking? And what were the challenges?**

When I began the original concept for Desolation I started painting in the middle of the map, working out texture detail and lighting and quickly found myself imagining this cold, clean, stiff metallic bowl. I thought… ""Wow… there's gotta be some life in here somewhere."" After trying large flower pots under each window and bunnies at each base I scrapped those ideas and placed this metal arena into a moody overgrown jungle… with plenty of monkeys sprinkled throughout.

  
*The symmetrical nature of the map is well suited to Forerunner architecture.*  
  
  
**These maps had to get by a stringent Bungie art approval process. How difficult was that, and how was that interaction handled?**

We found as long as we brought the appropriate food offerings and animal sacrifices to the table, the approvals went much smoother. Actually, for the Desolation approvals I flew up to Bungie with Max and our Engineering Lead, Paul Isaac. This was my first trip up to see the studio and meet the team. That in-person interaction was a great way to get a better feel for what those guys were looking for. Everyone we met that day had great input (Marcus and Mike especially). But I'd have to say the easiest part of the process was how consistent and creative their feedback was.



  
  
  
*During firefights, the simply vertical structure offers few hiding places, but lots of strategy.*  
  
  
**Hang Em High is probably the most familiar to players – were you intimidated by the challenge of making it recognizable?**

It wasn't nearly as intimidating as it was euphoric. Hang Em High was my favorite map from Halo 1 as well. So the fight to keep it true to the original was a necessity. Sure we added our own flavor to it. Our hope was to use the original as perfect inspiration and even though it would end up a completely different environment (even as far as the change from Forerunner to Human architecture) I wanted to be able to play it with my eyes closed… And if when I opened them and found that I had fallen through a crack and ended up in a location I couldn't have reached that way before? Well… That's just the icing on the cake.



  
*Tombstone's grim horizon is a reminder that New Mombasa fared badly in the Covenant assault on Earth.*  
  
  
**How much of Tombstone's design was based on necessity, versus pure artistic license?**

Tombstone was quite the artistic challenge. I am a texture map artist at heart and the biggest hurdle we faced was blowing our texture budget on this map. The trouble is that you can see every texture in the map from just about any point you stand. We wanted Tombstone's performance to 'scream' so we had to be very creative in how we painted our textures. We are all very pleased with the end result.



  
*Creating more logical human structures for the Halo CE classic was a challenge in itself - while retaining the level's familiar navigation.*  
  
  
**What kind of process did CA use to take the maps from concept to completion, and what are the primary tools and techniques?**

The art process would start after we received a final mass out of geometry from our design team. I would then take this 'blank canvas' map and begin mood and style paintings establishing color palette and material style. Once I worked out the overall direction, Brad (our concept artist) and myself would begin breaking the mood paintings into production drawings and atmosphere direction. Steve and Dean (modelers) would then take these concepts and implement them into the geometry. With the entire technical process coming under the careful watchful eye of our tech artist, Shishka. He looked after the procedural side of development with the same accuracy and care that he uses when peering through the scope of a battle rifle. While the modeling was coming together I did a majority of the texture work… a little lighting… some spec and bump… baked at 450 degrees for a half hour with love… and there… we have Desolation and Tombstone.



  
*The moody lighting is dictated by the idea of an industrial waste on the outskirts of a ruined New Mombasa.*  
  
  
**Tell us about the art staff at Certain Affinity.**

Well, I covered a bit of this in the question above but here's a bit more detail. We have Brad (Pokey). He is our concept artist. Brad and I have worked together now for several years. This makes life on the art team a bit easier as we know each other's styles through and through. With a background in industrial design and a creative mind… Brad is one of the best. Dean (Spork) and Steve (Fuzz) have worked together for years as well. They are both long time veterans in the games industry and are huge assets to the team. Both are master modelers. Then there's Chad (Shishka). He is the self-proclaimed bitter pessimist. Which brings great balance to the team as I am the eternal optimist. Which brings us to me (-BIGCHRIS-). I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that but mostly I just make sure everyone's coffee cups are full. But seriously, I try to steer the art team with a consistent vision laid down with mood paintings and asset direction and then on the back end with mostly texture work and overall guidance.



  
*Familiar objects take on unfamiliar hues in the all-new Tombstone graphics. Not a pixel remains unchanged.*  
  
  
**What is your favorite map, artistically speaking, from the existing crop of Halo 2 maps?**

I would have to go with Turf. I enjoy the map from a player’s perspective but even more from a Texture Artist’s point of view. Since the map is a series of alleys and corridors you are able to cram textures in to any given small area and not have a performance hit. From a development standpoint that is gold. As well just the overall variety of locations within the map and the color scene changes are fantastic… ya… for sure my favorite.

**What are the art boys at CA working on next?**

Dead Men Tell No Tales!



   
*Tombstone's homage to Hang 'Em High is as pretty as it is playable.*

I got stood up at the altar.
But the worst part? He didn’t even call — his brother did.

Jason and I had been together for four years. We met in college, survived long distance, and built what I thought was a solid future. He proposed on a beach trip with our families, the kind of moment you only see in movies. Everyone said we were “meant to be.”

The morning of our wedding, I woke up smiling. My dress hung by the window, sunlight spilling across it like some kind of blessing. My mom was crying happy tears, the photographer was snapping pictures, and I was counting down the minutes.

Then my phone buzzed.
It was his brother, Adam.

He didn’t even say hello. Just: *“He’s not coming.”*

At first, I laughed. I thought it was a joke — some stupid prank between brothers. But Adam’s voice cracked. “He left last night. He said he can’t do it.”

The room spun. My mom’s face went pale. The flowers, the music, the hundreds of guests waiting… it all suddenly felt fake, like a play I’d been cast in without a script.

I didn’t cry that day. Not once. I smiled through every “I’m so sorry” and posed for photos with my bridesmaids because I refused to let him ruin my story. But when I got home that night — still in my wedding dress — I finally fell apart.

A week later, I got a letter from Jason. He said he “loved me too much to trap me in a future where he wasn’t sure.” Whatever that meant.

I burned the letter.


A year later, I met Adam again — by accident, at a coffee shop. We talked for hours. He apologized for how his brother hurt me… and somehow, that conversation turned into friendship.

Now, three years later, we’re dating. Carefully. Honestly. And I finally understand — sometimes heartbreak doesn’t destroy you. It clears the path to the person who truly sees you.

About three months ago, I posted here about a small dream called Greenova Tea. A tea shop in Frisco that kind of identifies as a coffee shop. I was full of excitement back then, but if I’m honest, I was also full of fear.

The first couple of months were tough  painfully tough. There were days where hardly anyone came in. Some days I’d stand behind the bar, staring at the door, wondering if the person who walked by will be my customer? I started to think that if I’d made the wrong decision entirely. We even lost a few employees because it was just too slow.

But something unexpected happened and people from this very Reddit community showed up. Some of you came by to try a drink, others left kind words online, and a few even shared our post, which brought in more curious faces.

And that small ripple of kindness started to grow.

One of our very first customers, Zach, offered to redo our entire website for free just because he wanted us to succeed. (Our old one really needed the help 😅.) Another early supporter, Corvie, has been coming since day one and always bringing her friends, coworkers and family! Tried almost all our drinks and cheering us on like family.

Then came more customers who kept returning, bringing their friends, leaving encouragement, and making the space feel alive. Every single person who stopped by, smiled, or said something kind helped me keep going.

I can honestly say  without exaggeration  that this Reddit post and the people who found us through it gave me the push not to give up. You all reminded me that community doesn’t happen overnight; it’s built cup by cup, person by person.

And now, a few months later, we’re still standing,  growing slowly, and finally seeing new faces every week. It feels surreal.

We’ll be finally having our official grand opening this Saturday Oct 18th!! And while that’s exciting, what really matters to me is being able to look back and say thank you.

I’ll be in the shop all day, trying to connect with as many people as possible  so if you ever stop by, please ask for Joseph and let me know you’re from Reddit. I’d love to thank you personally for helping this little tea shop survive its hardest chapter.

💚 Thank you, Frisco. You really kept me going.

I was nervous but everyone in the workplace was welcoming and I came to really enjoy it there. I was working all the nightshifts at this time, and I came to really get close and comfortable with the assistant manager (22M). We were working together every weekend and the only other person on our shift was the cook. We had a lot in common and when the restaurant was slow, we would talk and I started to gain interest. When I learned he had a girlfriend, I backed off and saw him as a potential close friend at work as I was also seeing someone for a few short weeks at the time. I had a bad breakup a year prior, so I wasn't looking for anything serious. My manager, let's call him Wells, started to open up to me about the problems he was having in his relationship. He told me he was no longer invested and was tired of getting ""b*tched at"". He said he was feeling that way for a couple of months and wanted to end it because he wasn't happy. I told him to have a conversation with her and tell her what's on his mind. He was stringing her along and I said it was better to do it sooner rather than later as I know how it feels to be on the other side of that dynamic. I met her a few times at work when she would visit, and she was nothing but sweet.

Fast foward a few weeks and he told me he finally did it. He said it took him some time to sit her down because he's ""a coward"" (his words) of having tough conversations. Work went on as normal but a few days later he invited me over to his place to drink. (This was end of January). Even though I felt a little guilty because of the break-up being so fresh, I said yes. That, my friends, was the beginning of it all. We hooked-up that night and then we started seeing each other very consistently right off the bat. I was at his house every night pretty much. I never intended to catch real feelings for Wells, but that was inevitable as time went on. We agreed to only sleep with one another after a month or so but as of then, we were nothing but friends with benefits. I helped him move out of his house and into a new apartment. I was hanging out with his friends outside of work as he did with my friends. He met my family a good number of times as well. I started to live with him pretty much as weeks went by and my things started to fill up his bedroom. His birthday was in March, and I was obviously invited to his party his roommates threw him. That was the night I started to notice he was really close with another one of our coworkers (25F). Let's call her Martha. Martha was the first coworker that made me feel welcome. I thought she was cool, in simple terms. We would go out and smoke together when we would have breaks at work. Mostly small talk, but I did talk about my relationship with Wells with her. She was also friends with Wells but I didn't think much of it as everyone at work was really close. At his party, the way they were talking and the distance between them, I immediately had a feeling something was going on. Wells and I still had no title at this time, but we both had many conversations about how much we liked one another. (He would get upset when I would post myself on my Instagram or block the men ""I shouldn't be talking to""). He was very jealous at any man I gave my attention to. Out of respect for him, I stopped.

Because we had no title, I felt like I had no right to feel jealous. I felt like I was a little crazy or looking too much into it. I then began to notice that they would go off on their own to smoke without me, or how they would snapchat each other all the time. It was a bunch of little things that started to really bother me. (Lowkey flirting but not at the same time). A few days after his birthday, I was at work with another one of my coworkers (who was actually a longtime friend of mine that helped me get the job). She was also close with Martha and told me some things that she also noticed. At my wits end, I finally built up the courage to ask Wells about his relationship with Martha. I told him how I was uncomfortable with it and he proceeded to tell me there was absolutely nothing going on and they were just friends. He promised me that he had no interest in her or intention to hurt me. One of his big reasons was because she had a fling with one of his roommates' months prior. I trusted him, as I had no reason not to. But then the story turned and he eventually confessed that they would flirt in and outside of work but it again, meant nothing and he would stop. I was obviously upset as I felt a little betrayed by the both of them. Her, as I thought she was a friend and him as I thought we had something going on. I eventually looked passed it but asked if he would respect me and stop. He agreed.

In about April, when I would get to work and see Martha, I noticed she started getting short with me. She started ignoring me completely or snapping about how I was a few minutes late and she had shit to do. I just let it go, but as time went on, she started to get ruder in a way. The way she scoffed every time she'd pass me. I asked Wells if he knew what was going on and he would just shrug and pass it off with a, ""I don't know."" I didn't really care much for it as Wells and I were starting to grow closer. We were still hanging out every single day; we would go grocery shopping together on our days off. We had our shows and movies we would watch. We were in a relationship, but still we were not official. I didn't want to pry as I still remembered he hasn't been out of his prior relationship for long. I was also in no rush to get into a relationship either and that was a conversation we had. I felt secure and we had a routine.

In June, I was pretty much head over heels in love with this guy. We had plans to go up to a lake for the day, we invited on of my very close friends Natalie (19F). We had a very good time and good conversations. Afterwards we went to my house, and we all swam in my pool with my siblings, and he proceeded to pay for dinner afterwards. I really felt like I had found someone I would be very happy to have in the future. That day I realized I had never been happier. I also was able to talk to Natalie one on one and she told me that Wells had confessed to her that he had wanted to ask me to be his girlfriend soon. On top of the world. At the very end of the night, we did what we usually did. Went back to his place and put on our show. That is when he sat me down and confessed what had really been going on. He started with how much he was in love with me. How I was a wonderful person and that I made him very happy. He talked about taking me back to his hometown to live together but before all of that he needed to get something off his chest. He continued to tell me that him and Martha had been sleeping together. That they hooked up once before his birthday and a few times after, but he stopped after he realized that he wanted something more with me. I was speechless and stormed out. I spent the night at my parents' house in shambles. The next few days I would continuously meet up and speak with him. I don't really know why, I was so hurt and just needed answers. I was angry for sure and pointed out all the ways it was twisted. Pointed out his lies n such and how those actions affected me.

Conversation after conversation, we spoke about everything. He promised he would change and be the man I needed him to be. He wanted to better himself for me and give me what I deserve. After much thought, and the fact that I loved him, I looked passed it. Even though I forgave him, I never forgot about his ""mistake."" I thought about it all the time. It affected my day to day. I felt angrier, easier to overstimulate. I wanted him so bad that I overlooked the disrespect. I started to look at Martha's social media. I noticed she was posting hurtful things directed towards me. I was also told from other coworkers of the things she would say about me via social media. ""I wish she would poor coffee on herself again."" She started throwing words out like, ""ugly f*cking bitch,"" ""evil troll."" She started posting aggressive phrases on her TikTok as well. I never brought this up with Wells as I thought it was irrelevant even though it was hurtful at the end of the day. The next two months, this behavior continued from Martha. I began to feel unsafe at work and I always overthought the little things again. What do Wells and Martha talk about when I'm not there? Can I trust him?

Martha sent me a message beginning of August. She told me that Wells said he thought about her when him and I were intimate. That he would get hard at the thought of her and one day I would be with a man who didn't think about her when he was with me. After confronting Wells, this was all said to be true but he said he didn't mean it when he told her. That when he was sleeping with her, he just told her things she wanted to hear because she was very insecure about the fact that he was still with me. He also said alcohol was involved. More things I learned is that Martha would say these harsh things to Wells face to face. He says he would defend me but I still feel like he didn’t.

Our relationship wasn't the same after. I began to resent him, but I was still so attached to him at the same time I overlooked the situation again. I always knew in the back of my mind something wasn't right, but I just wanted to be happy for a little bit longer. He said he would block her so I was able to put the situation to rest a little. That he would only act as her coworker and nothing more. This brings us to present day. I learned from Natalie that Martha said she'd be contacting Wells for the past couple of weeks. This was something I was not aware of. When I brought it up with him, he got defensive and said it was nothing. That he just felt like an asshole for cutting her off cold turkey and wanted no bad blood with anyone. He swore they were just friends but that she would try and flirt with him, but he would cut it off and say he was with me. He then said that it was a ""dealbreaker"" pretty much if he couldn't talk to her and just be nice. I noticed the next few days that he was hiding his phone more than usual. Many of my friends told me that I needed to go through his phone. This is something that I don't like doing as I understand that people need their privacy and that feels like an invasion. I finally built up the courage last Tuesday and did so while he slept. There I found absolutely nothing but recently deleted photos of provocative photos of Martha as well as a few messages from Martha sent that night. He had deleted everything else as well as removed everything else from the recently deleted so I was not able to retrieve anything more. Martha had sent him a photo of herself in the mirror with ""just got home"" attached. (This photo was not appropriate either guys.) I took pictures of all the evidence, as well as a deleted reddit story he posted back in June. I packed my shit up as he sat on the bed looking defeated. Trying to come up with excuses like, ""I don't know why she would send me that."" I was again in shambles that night. I said I would not be coming into work and that I would quit. I said that I hated him and Martha for what they did and I was done. Those two days were complete hell before I decided that I was in no state to quit my job and returned hesitantly to work. I backtracked and began to talk to Wells as I would in the past. Like nothing happened but then I would catch myself and try to remember what he did. He told me he loved me and that he wanted no one else. He said that he was just a coward and let things get too comfortable. He's been claiming that she's just crazy and won't leave him alone. 

I spent the last couple of day with him but we have not talked about the situation since. I still love him with my whole heart, but Martha has and will always seem to be a problem. She won't leave it alone and I know it might be because of what she's hearing from him. I don't really know what to do. I guess I just need some guidance. Is this relationship unsavable? Everyone is telling me to leave, and I know that's what I should do but I can't bring myself to do it.",1,1760589432.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

The place itself is a new build, only completed in May last year, but that didn’t stop me from giving the lounge a full 1970s and Mid Century Modern makeover.

Most of the furniture was sourced locally, and I managed to find some incredible bargains. The sofa came from Bridlington for just £50 — a genuine 1969 G Plan that the elderly lady who owned it had kept in immaculate condition, so it still looks practically new. I also picked up pieces from the Nathan “Squares” range, including a corner unit and sideboard, for just £26 and £50 respectively.

The orange floor lamp behind the sofa was a £2 find, and the coffee table in the middle of the room cost me £5. But the best deal of all has to be my Bang & Olufsen setup: a Beovision 11 TV, Beolab 2 subwoofer, and Beolab 3 speakers, which I managed to get for around £340 in total. Considering the previous owner paid about £12,000 for it back in 2015, I’d call that a serious score.

The Hi-Fi setup to the  right corner of the image and the Eames-style chair are pieces I’ve owned for several years. I got back into vintage Hi-Fi in a big way around 2010/2011 and bought the chair in 2018. Now that I’ve moved out, it’s nice to finally have them properly displayed and given pride of place in my lounge.

So I was going through my old phone the other day and checking out text messages. I stumbled across an old contact of mine, a girl that I was extremely close with. We both liked each other a lot at the time, and were on the same wave length for everything, but we never became official because I was honestly scared to. (would of been my first relationship). Even though I know we would of gotten along incredibly and had a healthy relationship. Throughout the years we became more distant because she kept dropping obvious hints, but I kept friendzoning her solely because I was scared of being in a committed relationship. (this was after over a couple years of us talking) Looking back I obviously should have talked about that with her but I was an idiot highschooler at the time and didn't know any better.

  
The distance grew, and it got to the point where we were practically strangers, and hadn't exchanged words in close to a year. Fast forward to a couple years ago, (years after we last talked) I got back in contact with this girl, and after exchanging some friendly banter over text we decided to meet up for coffee. After talking for awhile and going out for a walk, we updated eachother on our lives, and what I heard from her really turned my stomach. In our time apart she got into an incredibly abusive relationship with a much older man (15 year age gap), picked up smoking and some other drugs as an escape, and was very very mentally unwell. A dramatic difference from the girl I remember. When we were talking in highschool she was very outgoing and open, happy to chat about literally anything. But the woman I was walking with was quiet, fragile, and almost seemed scared. Our time of contact didn't last, as she wanted to hook up and get together but it just didn't feel right or like it would end well if I did that. Especially in her current state. I told her I wasn't interested in that but she just kept pushing for it, so our contact fizzled out.

  
I know people change over the course of years. But with such a dramatic change I feel incredibly guilty for the damage I may have directly or indirectly caused. Because if I wasn't so scared back in highschool, I know we would of been together for a long time, then she wouldn't of gotten into that abusive relationship...and she likely wouldn't be as mentally unwell as she is today. Or if I at least stayed in contact with her, I could have talked her out of being in that relationship in the first place...I know it sounds really irrational to say and think that, and I'm hearing that as I type it out. But I still feel incredibly guilty that this now woman is completely broken dealing with demons, and a shell of what she used to be.

1o7wypd,https://www.reddit.com/r/uppereastside/comments/1o7wypd/wsj_wait_when_did_the_upper_east_side_get_cool_by/,"[WSJ] - “Wait, When Did the Upper East Side Get Cool?” - by Lane Florsheim","https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/travel/upper-east-side-new-york-neighborhood-restaurants-33cf1099


Of all the neighborhoods in New York City, the Upper East Side has long had a reputation for being the most boring, old-school and stuffiest part of town. That’s what Harold Moore was thinking when he was on the hunt for a space to open a new restaurant last year after the popular downtown bistro he was previously known for, Commerce, closed.

“I wrote it off how everybody wrote it off,” Moore said. “It’s all old people and rich people and it’s just not that cool.” 

Then it dawned on him: Soho and the West Village are now home to a new, more extreme kind of wealth. “I feel like it’s influencer bait over there,” he said. “You don’t get the repeat business that restaurants are built on.” Uptown restaurant goers are neighborhood people, the kind who will come in once or twice a week to spend $99 for his “famous” roast chicken or sit at the bar for a drink. So he opened Cafe Commerce on Lexington Avenue earlier this year. Plus, downtown people love to come anyway. 

Uptown is the new downtown. The realtors say so. So do the TikTokers, who are calling the Upper East Side the new West Village. Businesses that have long had footholds in downtown neighborhoods are opening in the neighborhood, which spans from 59th to 96th Street between the East River and Central Park. Both newcomers and old timers love its sense of community; they get to know their neighbors, and frequent mom-and-pop shops that have been in the area for decades. Because for every luxury brand outpost on Madison Avenue, there’s a small business that specializes in dollhouse furniture or German meats or food and drink books. 

“Everyone up here knows the area’s changing,” said Barbara Corcoran. The real estate mogul and “Shark Tank” investor has lived in the neighborhood for decades. “There’s more youth moving in, more kids starting out who aren’t moving to the village anymore. I think the main reason is it’s the best deal in town.” 
There are, in a way, two Upper East Sides, with Lexington Avenue as the dividing line. West of it, towards Central Park, is the land of high-priced co-ops and upscale shopping; east, towards the river, is younger and less expensive. Corcoran said that renting a one-bedroom apartment east of Third Avenue averages $3,500 versus $5,500 for the same amount of space in Chelsea. 

The 2nd Avenue Q train extension, which was completed in 2017 after a nine-year, somewhat controversial construction process, also made the neighborhood more accessible. “It’s a beautiful new subway,” said Corcoran. “It just feels optimistic.”

Over the last year, buzzy restaurants like Chez Fifi, Lucia Pizza and Westmoreland, the cafe inside the newly renovated Frick Collection, have all landed on the Upper East Side. 
Lee Hanson and Riad Nasr, who made their names at Keith McNally’s Balthazar, the iconic brasserie that helped transform Soho into what it is today, bought Le Veau D’Or from the family who previously owned it. The restaurant, on East 60th Street, was known for its classic French dishes and clientele that included Jacqueline Onassis and Ernest Hemingway, and Hanson and Nasr were compelled by its storied history. The chef-owners reopened it in July 2024. Now the restaurant has become the epicenter of stylish downtowners coming uptown for opulent dinners where the restaurant’s regulars—older, well-dressed, celebratory—are part of the draw. “We had a couple celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary,” Hanson said. “They’re in their 80s, they dress up and they want to have fun.”
Everything is cyclical. Holly Golightly, the iconic “Breakfast at Tiffany’s” protagonist and party girl, lived on East 71st Street in a brownstone with a Tiffany-blue door, where one of the most famous movie party scenes of all time took place. In the ’80s, the Upper East Side was filled with young people and bars. Candace Bushnell was still writing her “Sex and the City” column when she lived in the neighborhood in the ’90s. Every single night she’d take the FDR Drive downtown to go out in areas that weren’t yet residential. At the time, SoHo was still full of galleries, Tribeca was mostly warehouses, and the Meatpacking District was a place where they actually sold meat.  

By the 2000s, Bushnell was living downtown on 9th Street. But a few years ago she moved back uptown into the same 74th street building where Dorothy Parker once lived. “There are a few single women who live in my building, so there’s a camaraderie there, a feeling of community,” Bushnell said.  

Influencers are also discovering it. At places like Bemelmans Bar at the Carlyle hotel “there’s a line of young, attractive people wanting to get in,” she said. “That didn’t exist 15 years ago.”
Other spots have gone viral on Instagram and TikTok, including Butterfield Market, Ralph’s Coffee and Cafe Maud, an East Village eatery that recently opened uptown. A new generation of swanky members clubs like Casa Tua, Maxime’s and Coco’s at Colette has also moved in, joining the neighborhood’s old-guard social clubs, many of which, like the J.P. Morgan-founded Metropolitan Club, have been around for over a century. 

On a recent Tuesday night, Elio’s, an Italian establishment on Second Avenue, was packed. Tables were filled with multi-generational families, Gen Z couples on first dates and boisterous groups of friends. A priest sat near the front of the restaurant. “That’s Father Nolan,” said Luca Guaitolini, the son of the restaurant’s late, eponymous founder, on a phone call a few days later. “This is where he comes to kick it.”

Guaitolini, now in his 30s, has lived his whole life in the neighborhood. “Childhood on the Upper East Side was awesome, and I think that’s why it’s getting popular now,” he said. “You could go to John Jay Park after dark and there were still crackheads but we were kind of blissfully unaware because our parents would let us roam free.” He likened the return of Brooklynites and downtowners to the Upper East Side to salmon returning to the home stream. 

The popularity of the Upper East Side relates to real estate agent Eva Alt’s feeling that we’re in a second Gilded Age. “Preppy dressing is back. The old money vibe is back, the obsession with Carolyn Bessette,” said Alt, who made her name selling apartments that often belonged to artists and other significant figures. 
She said that these days her clients often say they’d like to live in the West Village, Greenwich Village, Brooklyn Heights or the Upper East Side. Alt herself plans to move uptown. “I just belong in a Beaux Arts” building, she said. 
Cassandra Grey, the founder and artistic director of the fragrance house Madame Grey, moved back to the Upper East Side in 2022 and opened a flagship of her upscale beauty store Violet Grey on Madison Avenue earlier this year. After years in L.A., she and her 10-year-old son love the neighborhood’s walking culture. They walk to his school and Central Park every day. After drop-off, she sometimes stops at Ralph’s Coffee. “In the morning, that place is wild,” said Grey. “There are so many people walking their kids to maybe 15 different schools. And then they’re all congregating at Ralph’s afterwards. Schools start at 8, and it opens at 8.” 

It’s Grey’s second time living in the neighborhood; she and her late husband, TV executive Brad Grey, used to live on the 26th floor of the Carlyle, now the hotel’s Presidential Suite. These days, she lives in Yorkville.“There’s still some grime. It feels more village-y than where I used to live, which was glamorous and fancy but not as neighborhood-y,” she said. 
One other major difference: The Upper East Side is “not a place where you go downtown to have fun and then you go home to sleep anymore.” She likes getting sushi at Noz and late nights at Maxime’s and Café Carlyle.

Part of the appeal, says Thom Browne, is that uptown and downtown just aren’t that different anymore. Browne, the fashion designer known for his shrunken suiting, recently opened two new stores on the Upper East Side, joining other labels like Khaite, Toteme, Kallmeyer and Ulla Johnson, which all had flagships downtown first. Browne, who lives in the neighborhood’s Sutton Place enclave, enjoys aspects of the neighborhood—he starts every day with a coffee from Sant Ambroeus. But, he said, New York’s neighborhoods can feel like they’re melding together. “They’re not as differentiated as they used to feel when I moved here in the late ’80s,” he said. 

Celebrity facialist Crystal Greene, whose studio is across the street from the Ralph Lauren mansion, appreciates how the area she’s in can feel like Paris. “Neighborhoods downtown shift and change so much,” she said. “There are a lot of people on the Upper East Side who have so much history, they’ve lived there for a really long time.” 

Many people crave community, something not easily found in New York City—except, perhaps, on the Upper East Side. “You walk the streets and you bump into the same person five times a day, whether it’s in the park, taking their coffee at Sant Ambroeus, buying their shampoo at Zitomer or buying their groceries at Ouri’s,” said Marieva Malo, who owns The Way, an online Pilates platform and private studio on the Upper East Side. “Eventually the people I’ve found uptown adopted me and that pulled me in.”
She added happily, “Now I don’t think I’m going to go anywhere else.”

The woman yawned and shut off her alarm before sitting up. 
Polo her dog lay at the edge of her bed tail wagging happy to see his owner awake. She yawned and stretched before getting up and slipping on her cozy blue slippers and trudging her way to the restroom. 
After using the restroom she walked out and let polo out to the bathroom and then got ready for her day. She decided once polo was back in she was gonna shower so she got her shower ready and set out today’s smells.

The woman made her way to her favorite cafe downtown, the woman kept checking her phone before walking into the shop the smell of coffee and fresh baked goods hitting her nose. She already smelled like warm vanilla and expensive leather so the smells okey added to her.

1o7wx53,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1o7wx53/soggy_cereal_crunchy_cereal/,soggy cereal ≥ crunchy cereal,"Soggy cereal is undoubtedly as good as or even better than crunchy cereal.

My case study:

1. The Texture of Tranquility

Crunchy cereal is aggressive. Every bite is a snap, a pop, a full-on jaw workout. Soggy cereal, on the other hand, is the food equivalent of a weighted blanket. It’s soft. It’s calming. It’s gentle on the teeth, gums, and soul.

2. Fusion Flavour

Crispy cereal and milk are like two roommates who tolerate each other. Soggy cereal and milk? Soulmates. As the cereal soaks, flavours deepen. The milk becomes a gourmet cereal broth. Every bite is infused, not just surface-level coating, but full-on flavour absorption.

3. Freedom from the Tyranny of the Clock

Crunchy cereal demands you rush. Eat now or suffer the consequences. Soggy cereal? It’s for the patient, the poets, the thinkers. You can:

Pour your bowl

Sip your coffee

Stare pensively out the window

Return at your leisure

4. Crunch is a Lie

That initial crunch? Sure, it's great for 12 seconds. Then it’s gone. And what are you left with? A bowl of disappointment. A sogginess you didn’t consent to. A half-hearted chew that feels like betrayal. If you love crunchy cereal, you’re chasing a high that disappears instantly. Soggy cereal? It stays loyal. It's consistent. It’s the slow burn, not the spark.

Final Argument:

To love soggy cereal is to go against the mainstream. It’s a choice made by connoisseurs of comfort, not bound by marketing slogans or society’s misguided worship of “crunch.”

If you’ve been manually breaking dialogues or guessing the character limits — this tool basically automates that entire process.

Here’s how it works 👇

# 🧠 1. Prepare Your Script

Start with any script that includes action + dialogue.  
It works best when your dialogues are clearly marked with `""quotes""` or words like *says*, *replies*, etc.

**Example:**

    John walks into the coffee shop, looking around nervously.
    John says ""I need to talk to you about something important.""

I’m hosting a small, casual meetup this Sunday, October 19, from 4 to 6 pm at The Congregation on Rosa Parks Blvd. It’s called “El Primer Cafecito,” and it’s basically a chance to hang out, drink some coffee, and practice Spanish together.

It’s super low-key — no lessons, no pressure, just good conversation. Everyone’s welcome, whether you’re fluent, learning, or just curious about the language. We’ll probably meet outside if the weather’s nice.

I thought it’d be fun to start building a little community of Spanish speakers and learners here in Detroit. If that sounds like your vibe, come by and say hi.

**Some Time After the Events of [I Am Batman #26](/r/DCNext/comments/1m1jy60/i_am_batman_26_the_fall_part_two/)…**

Sofia had to resist the urge to smirk at how angry Astrid Arkham looked as she hobbled over, weight pressed hard against the cane she used to balance herself. It had been a month since their last meeting — since Astrid had told Sofia to deal with her father, Jeremiah — and there wasn't another *planned* meeting for another month. Astrid largely allowed Sofia to act as she saw fit. Clearly she had done something Astrid hadn't thought of.

""You are a fucking idiot,"" Astrid shouted, swinging her cane up toward Sofia's chin, clocking her right in the corner of her jaw. Sofia moved with the blow, but remained standing in place, stretching her jaw and rubbing it with her hand as she looked back to Astrid in disbelief. The frail woman was filled with rage, and it showed in every inch of her body. Her scowl would've been scary had it not been attached to a small, 100-pound body.

""You're pissed,"" said Sofia, cracking her neck as she turned back to Astrid.

""Of course I am pissed!""

""Don't hit me again,"" Sofia continued, speaking firmly.

""I can do what I want,"" Astrid replied. ""It's my money you're spending.""

""It is now,"" Sofia muttered under her breath. Astrid bit her tongue, squeezing the handle of her cane tightly before taking a deep breath.

""Why would you kill him?"" asked Astrid, eyes closed and slowing her breathing.

""You told me to deal with him,"" Sofia said. ""I did you a favour, Astrid. Pigs are bought, they won't look into it. You get to mess with the legal stuff and get all the money you're owed, and we lose a whole complication. Whether he knew about all this or not, he was in the way.""

""It's going to be a lot more work to free up those funds, Sofia,"" said Astrid. ""It was easier when he was alive."" She refused to look at Sofia even still, eyes glancing between the windows and the enforcers at Sofia's back.

The office they were meeting in wasn't particularly large, it was a small building in Somerset that Sofia had bought for the sake of having something in the neighbourhood, but it was useful for private conversations. Astrid had only brought one person with her, some small looking man with glasses, black hair and a scruffy beard. Sofia could get a sense of his physique beneath the suit he wore — he was built, intricately, almost — and kept her eye on him.

""You were too attached,"" said Sofia. ""Take it from me, family gets in the way.""

""He was the only one I had left,"" said Astrid, her voice low. ""Last person who really cared for me.""

""You'll get over it.""

Astrid shot a poisonous look at Sofia for a brief moment before shaking her head. Reaching into the inner pocket of the jacket she wore, she pulled out a small carton of cigarettes and stuck one in her mouth, before offering one to Sofia. Upon being declined, she returned the carton to her pocket and brought out a match, striking it quickly and lighting the cigarette. Sofia furrowed her brow at the man in the suit behind Astrid as he smirked, shaking his head lightly.

""What're you laughin' at?"" she demanded.

""Oh, nothing,"" he said. ""Just a little bit giddy.""

""What–?""

""Mayfly,"" Astrid said suddenly.

Three bullets flew through the windows, each meeting the throats of the three enforcers behind Sofia. She flinched, turning to watch the bodies fall before making a move toward Astrid. As she swung an arm out toward her partner, a small yet painful sensation shot up her arm, originating from her elbow. In the blink of an eye, the entirety of her arm went numb. She looked toward the man in the suit, with the shit-eating grin, and saw that he was standing in some sort of combat position, lead hand straightened into a point.

With her good arm, she tried reaching toward him, only for him to strike her just below the collarbone so fast that she barely saw him move before she felt everything go numb, sending her toward the ground. The man flipped Sofia onto her back.

""If you paid any attention to what I am doing,"" said Astrid. ""You would know this man.""

""Constantine Drakon,"" he said smugly. ""Still looking for a challenge.""

""And that woman out there–"" said Astrid, using the bottom of her cane to angle Sofia's head toward the window. Outside, across the street, nearly entirely obscured by the night sky and the rainfall, was the figure of a woman hanging upside down by the waist. She was pressed against the wall of the building opposite to them, carrying a sniper rifle that seemingly made no noise as it shot. The upper half of her head was covered by a smooth, opaque screen that was nearly entirely black, save for the few small, red indicators scanning left to right across her vision. ""–is Mayfly. They're here to work for the city under the GCPD's new elite squad.""

Astrid repositioned Sofia's face to look up at her and removed her cane, placing it back down onto the ground.

""I got Lane into his position after you took Gordon out of the picture,"" Astrid continued. ""I do thank you for speeding along that process, by the way. He did me the favour of allowing me to sponsor a six-person squad of elite mercenaries, which includes Mister Drakon and Miss Mayfly. Officially, they serve the city. For us, they aim to further our goals, but their loyalty ultimately lies with me, and my money. The money that you are using to facilitate this entire takeover. Keep that in mind Sofia.""

Astrid turned to walk away, but Drakon did not follow. Instead, he stood over her, grin on his face, and chuckled lightly. The door closed behind Astrid, and for a moment Drakon's eyes seemed to divert toward the windows, searching for Mayfly. A moment later, they reverted back to Sofia.

""Don't worry,"" he said, leaning down and turning Sofia's head toward the dead enforcers only a few feet away from her. ""It'll wear off in about twenty minutes. Make sure you don't swallow your tongue."" The chuckling continued as Drakon walked out of sight, following Astrid out of the building.

**Present**

Michael Lane felt out of place in Gotham City, even amid the institutions he'd been a part of for decades. The Gotham City Police Department was a mess, internally and externally, and the Mayor's office seemed just as bad. The only place he considered to be in decent shape was the District Attorney's office, but Harvey Dent's campaign for reelection after years of super-villainy and rehab stints made it hard for him to have faith in it.

He hid his contempt for the state of the city well as he let Sarah Essen's secretary call for the mayor. Lane stood dead straight, waiting, hands clasped behind his back as the secretary spoke to the mayor, nodding, affirming and negating whatever statements the mayor was making. He put the phone down and smiled at Lane.

""She's ready for you in her office,"" said the secretary. Lane nodded and moved toward the elevator. It was a lonely ride up to Essen's office, and one that didn't inspire hope as the light bulb within flickered every few moments. He frowned as the elevator stopped and took just a moment too long to open.

Essen met him outside of the elevator.

""Commissioner Lane,"" she said, a kind smile on her face. He offered a nod in greeting. ""It's good to meet with you outside of ceremony and council.""

""Indeed it is,"" he replied. ""What is it that you were hoping to discuss?""

""Follow me to my office,"" she said, turning and walking back down the halls and toward her office. She opened the door and gestured for him to enter first, with a smile. ""Do you drink?"" she asked.

""Not during the day,"" he said.

""Do you mind if I have a glass?""

""Not at all, ma'am,"" he said. ""Better to be comfortable.""

""Don't I know it,"" she said, moving toward a small cabinet a few feet away from her side of the desk. She pulled up a whiskey glass and filled it only a small ways, taking a light sip before sitting down across from Lane. ""I'm sure you've gotten a good idea of what the city is like, at the moment.""

""It's quite vivid, Miss Mayor,"" he said. ""It's… different.""

""We are pretty unique,"" she said. ""Especially now, economically.""

""I had heard of an exodus, to put it one way,"" Lane said. Essen clicked her tongue and nodded, a look of frustration on her face.

""Gotham doesn't have much money,"" she said. ""All of our big hitters, all of the corps that came in after my incentives, they've left and we have a very small taxable base, all of a sudden. Without those employers, a lot of people are making a lot less money, and that's hit every business every way we can think. I've had to compensate on property taxes, but that's further reducing how much we have to work with, as city officials.""

""I take it that's why we've drafted up contracts with independents, like Astrid Arkham?"" Lane asked.

""Precisely,"" she replied. ""I'm not fond of the Arkham family, but Astrid presented a strong plan for her support of the GCPD. I was relieved when you accepted it. Do we have a start date for them yet?""

""Within the month,"" he said. ""Orientation has been… interesting. Mercenaries and ex-cons don't make the best law enforcement, but I won't say no to the help as long as they do their job.""

""I'm sure they will,"" Essen said. ""They have incentive to."" Lane nodded for a moment, watching as Essen took another sip of her drink.

""Anything that reduces our reliance on Batman and her compatriots is a step I'm willing to take,"" Lane said. ""I understand they're a part of Gotham's history, but their existence reduces faith in the institutions that build up our country and uphold the rule of law. It's smart to distance ourselves from them.""

""I understand–""

""For the past few months, officers have been mandated to avoid contact with Batman, Robin, and other vigilantes and focus purely on their police work. I've seen great progress in reducing our reliance on private citizens with deep pockets.""

""That's excellent, Commissioner,"" said Essen. ""I suppose it would be good to have a self-sufficient police force, but–""

""I have no intention of *outlawing* the Batman or her friends,"" he continued. ""I'm not so daft that I’m unaware of the ramifications of that, I just want to reduce our reliance on them.""

""Good… Good,"" Essen said, her voice dropping into a mutter. ""After all that's happened, outlawing Batman wouldn't go over with Gothamites well at all. They're already losing their jobs, I don't think they want to lose their symbol.""

""Exactly my thoughts,"" said Lane.

""But… you should know something about the vacancy in this city,"" Essen continued. ""Property isn't staying on the market, unoccupied. There are transactions happening. People are buying up everything that's being abandoned or put up for sale, but…"" She paused for a moment, thinking on the patterns she'd seen. ""I don't think there's more than a handful of people making these transactions. Someone is buying the city, one lot at a time.""

""Do you have any idea who?"" asked Lane. ""Is it someone I should be interested in?""

""I don't have specifics yet,"" Essen replied. ""They work through shell companies and, mostly, cash.""

""I see,"" Lane said, looking down slightly to think. ""I can get some of our analysts on these transactions to find the source, but if there's no unlawful conduct, I have no power.""

""Yeah,"" Essen said with a sigh. ""That's the hard part.""

The lifted her glass and swirled it around, staring at something a thousand yards away, right through Lane. He remained silent as she sat in thought. Moments passed. She closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and offered a smile.

""Another year in Gotham City,"" she said, knocking back the rest of her drink.

Harvey Dent lived in a shabby apartment in Old Gotham, close to what he called '*the heart of the city*.' It was here that he did so much of the work that was required to rehabilitate his image just as much as his mind had needed rehabilitation in the various facilities he'd been admitted to over the years. Emails, video calls and virtual presentations, personal essays, parole check-ins, and endless classes and exams.

His computer had restrictions placed on it when he told the courts that he wanted to get one for work and social contact. He was always monitored, or at least recorded if there wasn't anyone on the other side actively watching. Websites, his word processors, every person he contacted — he felt as though he hadn't left prison, nor the mental facilities. He was the image of rehabilitation, but no one trusted him — no one trusted the very process they paraded him around for having gone through.

The more time went on, he could feel the restraints getting more and more lax as everyone got used to the situation. Check-ins were shorter, he began to feel more secure in freely browsing the internet despite the presence of his restrictions, and it was much easier to tell when no one was watching. Mostly, it was because they would tell him.

He sighed when he heard the flutter of a cape and the sound of boots hitting the floor by his window. He grabbed the fresh mug of coffee he'd just made and continued on with the sugar and cream he'd gone to add.

""Batman,"" he said, a familiar name for a completely new person. ""I don't suppose you're here for idle chatter.""

""Have you heard about Gordon?"" she asked. He set the coffee creamer down and shook his head, placing both hands on the counter in front of him and settling into a lean.

""I have,"" he said. ""I hoped his time as commissioner would've ended more… dignified. I hear his replacement is settling in well.""

""He is already making mistakes,"" Batman said. ""Bad ones.""

""What a surprise,"" said Harvey, grabbing his mug and turning toward Batman. She was smaller than him in all ways, yet she still presented a greater threat than he knew. ""I'd offer you some coffee, but…"" He gestured to the coffee machine, one that took small, plastic cups of pre-grinded beans for single-servings. ""This is my last one.""

""I do not drink,"" she replied, taking a few steps into the apartment. ""I trust you, Harvey."" He resisted the urge to scoff as he stopped himself mid-sip. ""I do. I have seen what you have been, and I have seen what you can be. I am here for a reason, one you should be aware of.""

""And what would that be?"" He set the mug down on his small, two-person dinner table and pulled out a chair to sit in.

""The Falcones are back,"" she said. Harvey held his reaction. ""And Lane is helping them, whether he knows it or not.""

""Explain.""

""The police are bought,"" she continued. ""Right under Gordon's nose. Lane has not made any moves or inquiries, he thinks they are cooperating. Sofia Falcone and Astrid Arkham are working together. I do not know why, not fully, but they are."" Harvey began to bite his tongue, looking out the window toward the city lights. He winced. ""And Lane has hired new mercenaries and metahumans for a special squad. They have not been deployed, but I have heard of them, from the one police officer I trust, and it looks bad. I do not know how many there are, who they are, or what they have been allowed to do.""

Harvey was silent for a few moments, furrowing his brow and thinking hard as he found himself wading through memories of two decades ago.

""So, it's happening again, is it?"" he asked. Batman nodded. ""Who's your detective?"" he asked. Batman smirked and cocked her head slightly. ""Come on, I know how this goes. District Attorney, hotshot detective, and the vigilante. Can't say I expected to be here — or the be the relic in this situation — but I've definitely been here before.""

""Her name is Blair Wong,"" Batman said. ""She dislikes vigilantes, but she thinks Lane is either stupid or being manipulated.""

""So, she's come around to you?"" asked Harvey, grabbing his mug and taking a sip of his coffee. Batman nodded. ""At least there's that. Give me her number, I'll try to get in contact with her.""

""Good,"" said Batman. ""And try not to be followed, or recorded. The police are untrustworthy.""

""I'll do my best,"" said Harvey, raising his mug toward his mouth for another sip. ""How do I contact *you*?"" He asked.

""You will know when you need to,"" she said. Opening the window, she took one last look toward Harvey and nodded. ""Win the election."" He chuckled.

""I'm sure it'll be that easy."" He shook his head lightly and looked down for a moment, weighing the information he'd just been told against his better instincts. ""You really have faith in–"" 

She was gone.

""Yeah… just like old times.""

Barbara walked through the door of her father's hospital room, closing it lightly so as to not make too much noise.

""Hey dad,"" she said softly. ""Just wanted to stop by and say hi… I know it's been a few days since I've had time to visit."" She walked over to the chair next to his bed, leaning her crutches against the wall behind it. ""Work has been going well… Alysia and her wife are going on vacation next week, so shifts might get a little boring, but that's alright. They deserve some vacation time. Cassandra is doing great lately, really out of that funk she was in last year. Oh, and I know you're not too hot on Blair and I being a thing, and you probably don't want to hear the details about the department, but… She says things are looking rough. But besides that, we're thinking of moving in together. Since Cass has all but totally moved out by this point, we figured it could be a good time to look for a place of our own and less her and Christine do the same…""

She reached over and grabbed his hand, squeezing lightly.

""I… this is all stuff I should have told you a while ago, I know, but…""

His eyes remained closed.

""I guess I didn't realize things could get this bad.""

The equipment keeping him fed and alive was extensive. The casts around multiple limbs felt like overkill. The steady beeping of his heart monitor droned in the background as it became white noise.

""After all we've been through, somehow I didn't realize it could actually get this bad…""

Once the tears formed in her eyes, there was no stopping them.

She didn't utter another word for nearly an hour as she sobbed into his bedsheets.",1,1760588751.0,DCNext,0,1.0,False

A Hunter's Journal

A Hunting Story

This is my journal. 

I climb into a place that has always been. It smells of rotting cloth, a being that has existed before and after time. This has been my comfort, my place of existence that cradles me in the arms of nostalgia and puts me to sleep to views of stars in the heavens. It doesn't want to start-the old carburetor chokes to life, a creature that wants its rest. I've kept this truck alive because it joins me in a place of existence where both of us are exhausted of living. But it finally comes to life, a remnant of days gone by that seeks one final drive. It has stories to tell, it's a frankenstein of body parts replaced and a lifetime of owners who have met their end and passed it down to the next willing driver.

I start driving. I know where I'm going, a place my mind keeps driving me back to where youth met destruction and stars collided to create a new universe. It's been years since my father bought me this truck, a time and place that the mind tries to block out but dreams keep me going back to.

I'm hunting. I've been to this place many times, it is whete my childhood meets the man I've come to be. The road is dark, these old headlights won't guide the way but I know where I'm going. I pass the curves on this dirt road, I see the woods go by as if they're a map. I seek a chair, a place hidden by tree limbs and a thousand miles of memories. I seek to come here one last time. I have my tools-an old Winchester rifle, a thermos I've filled with coffee. A place in time that I may never get to visit again. I'm filled with fear. These old roads are dark, the woods cry out and try to pull me in with the branches of trees long grown over. 

I come to hunt one last time. 

These were the woods I grew up in. I bring my truck up to the gate where the road and woods collide-I haven't been here in years. I have the tools of the trade. My father's 30-06, his thermos and his pickup.

It's been a long time since I've been here. The woods are the same but seem to call out a different song, they are familiar and foreign at the same time.

I park the truck by the path I remember. I load up my rifle and supplies in a backpack. 

It's dark out. The sky is black, the woods are silent. They judge me as I walk towards my destination.

They remember. Days past of a father waking his son up early in the morning for a hunting trip. The mind wanders, it remembers the times sitting next the father on a seat watching for deer. 

The mind blocks out the memories. It wonders why the father was so silent in these moments, why the mother grew so distant. It only remembers the steps walking up this path.

I prop the rifle up on my shoulder by the sling. The sky is clear, the moon is bright, I forget why I'm here. I make my way past the gate-it wasn't here before. I walk up the hill and the sky opens up and shows me its stars.

I remember the early days. The father bringing me out in the morning, taking me on the early hunts. The coffee thermos, the silent walks up the hills finding our hunting place.

The way the mother became distant, how the father said less and less as time went by.

But I put that all behind me. I keep walking, the sounds of the earth serenading me and reminding me of why I'm here. I didn't come here by accident. I was called. A calling that invaded my mind what seems like decades ago. A calling that I couldn't block out.

I hear the sounds of my dogs. It takes me by surprise and my heart skips beats. Friends long past, voices out of the void I didn't want to hear. But they are there nonetheless. I follow them. My mind is full of fear, I'm in territory unknown. The past is calling me here.

I make my way up the hill. I see familiar sights-a hunting blind long since abandoned. A sick mother, a father prying my young eyes from seeing it.

I keep walking. The weeds and grass overtake me, I have a long way to go. Smells of breakfast in the morning, the father coming in to eat and taking me by his side to tell me stories.

Mother grows more sick. I keep walking. The sounds of nature flood my ears, they care not for the passage of time. They are new, without burden of the past.

I see my goal in the distance. A pile of tree branches, a chair. Somehow stuck in a place in time.

I keep walking. I see sunlight, a father walking me through the wilderness telling me stories of a bygone era. Sunlight tries to break through but I know it's a mirage. It's midnight, there is no light here. There is only the walk, a place that I fear so badly that it cripples my legs. But I keep walking in spite of it. I must face this.

1o7ws5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/conspiracy_commons/comments/1o7ws5v/the_top_30_ways_to_get_cancer/,The top 30 ways to get cancer,"**In other words, this is advice that should never be followed, but it is very important to know. Take care of yourself and your loved ones!**

**So, here is some bad advice:**

**1. Lead a sedentary lifestyle. Lie on the couch and don't move! The less you move, the more stagnant processes will occur in your body. The worse your blood and lymph circulation will be.**

**For reference: lymphocytes, our natural and only cancer killers, live in the lymph. And the movement of lymph is determined solely by muscle contractions.**

**2. Visit a tanning salon, go to Turkey or Egypt to sunbathe under the scorching rays of the sun. There is no better way to get skin cancer. It's no wonder Arab women wear veils.**

**3. Choose a place to live near a high-voltage power line. This is a great way to commit suicide. It is also useful to live on a polluted street so that there is no access to fresh air. Preferably neither day nor night. The best cities are St. Petersburg (the cancer capital), Moscow, the Chelyabinsk region, and Murmansk. Oh yes, I forgot! It is also useful to breathe air saturated with chemical vapors.**

**4. Use microwave ovens, warm your back with Nuga Best infrared radiation, go to an infrared sauna, get ultrasounds, get X-rays as often as possible, talk on your cell phone as much as possible, fall asleep hugging your computer, and never turn off the TV. These methods work perfectly. Oh yes, you don't need any protective devices against harmful radiation! They reduce the risk of getting sick by as much as half.**

**5. Eat only fried foods. Never eat raw vegetables and fruits. Even under threat of death. They contain a lot of vitamins and enzymes, which are dangerous for the healthy development of your future tumor.**

**Note: vitamins and enzymes strengthen the immune system.**

**6. Don't drink water. Ever. Especially living and alkaline water. Especially coral water. Drinks should only be acidic. This is because when the body is acidified, it goes into self-destruction mode, creating favorable conditions for tumor development. Coca-Cola and packaged juices are great!**

**Note: when the body becomes acidic, the mobility of lymphocytes decreases to almost zero. The immune system does not work.**

**7. Consume large amounts of aloe and vitamins B and C. Tumors really like this.**

**8. Of course, never use anything that boosts your immune system. It's even rude to know about them!**

**9. Don't miss a single chance to cheat on your partner. A promiscuous sex life is the best way to acquire a host of cancer-causing infections. It has been 100% proven that sexually transmitted viruses are cancer's best friends. Especially papillomavirus, genital herpes, hepatitis C, and Epstein-Barr virus.**

**10. Take your medication regularly, everything your doctor has prescribed and everything you have prescribed for yourself. Especially birth control pills and strong antibiotics. They work very effectively!**

**For reference: hormones lower immunity. And immunity is our only defense against cancer. Here's an example: pregnant women have higher hormone levels, which lowers their immunity so that the fetus is not rejected. And when organs are transplanted, hormones must be taken for life, otherwise the immune system will destroy them.**

**Antibiotics are dangerous because they cause rapid growth of fungi, which increase acidity in the body. And immunity practically does not work when acidity increases.**

**11. Go for medical procedures and never wear a protective mask in places where infectious patients gather. You will definitely catch something.**

**12. Eat only at the supermarket, where all food contains preservatives, especially E125, 510, 513, and 527. They are great for promoting cancer.**

**13. Never start your own garden, even on the balcony, and do not buy organic products. Only the supermarket! Because when herbicides get into animal feed, they produce xenoestrogens - a great way to enhance tumor growth.**

**14. Smoke to your heart's content, the more the better, as smoke contains a large amount of carcinogenic soot. An excellent remedy!**

**15. Alcohol is sacred! Not even up for discussion.**

**Reference: alcohol thickens the blood and suppresses the immune system.**

**16. Eat chicken meat, it is stuffed with growth hormones, which also lead to the growth of your future tumor. Pork too, for that matter... And never soak meat before cooking, you must not allow the hormones to dissolve in the water!**

**17. Eat white sugar – there is no better fertilizer for rapid tumor growth. Eat lots of it! Never eat honey or fruit sugar. They are less dangerous.**

**Note: it has been proven beyond doubt that cancerous tumors feed on the glucose contained in white sugar.**

**18. Drink 3 cups of coffee a day – cancer will come twice as fast! Especially in women – the risk of developing breast cancer increases by 68%. Just great!**

**19. Women, never breastfeed your children! You need to protect your breasts. And then the risk of developing breast cancer will increase sixfold!**

**20. In England, amino acid deficiency is ranked first among the causes of cancer! Therefore, do not eat complete protein foods, especially in the form of dietary supplements.**

**A deficiency of amino acids such as active methionine leads to an almost guaranteed occurrence of cancer. This is because methionine has the property of reducing inflammation.**

**Note: I would also like to add that amino acids build our defenders against cancer - lymphocytes. And not feeding them is simply stupid.**

**21. Consume as much vegetable oil as possible, as it contains a huge amount of polyunsaturated arachidonic fatty acid. It helps cause inflammation. And its excess also leads to a decrease in active metionine. This is a great way to grow a tumor in a short time. Never eat olive or flaxseed oil—they don't contain arachidonic acid!**

**22. Never cleanse your body of parasites, especially with safe methods. It has been proven that nasties such as trichomonads, giardia, toxocara, opisthorchis, and toxoplasma cause liver cancer. Worms are a given, so befriend them!**

**23. And of course, be nervous for your health! The more, the better. When you're stressed, your energy goes away... This way, we can deprive lymphocytes of energy and turn off the immune system. Moreover, cells deprived of energy activate a social repair mechanism, which means that DNA repair is blocked. And lymphocytes do not notice mutations!** 

**Note: In light of the above, never take sedatives during times of stress, especially if you can choose safe and natural alternatives.**

**24. Of course, you need a massage, because it allows metastases to spread quickly throughout the body. Vibration massage is also suitable.**

**25. Teeth should only be brushed with fluoride toothpaste. It has very powerful carcinogenic properties. An amazing cancer stimulant.**

**26. Use cosmetics, they always contain preservatives. Sodium benzoate is extremely carcinogenic. An exclusive means of suicide! It is found in a huge range of cosmetic products.**

**27. Eat lots of smoked foods (you can also eat sprats), as they contain benzopyrene, a powerful carcinogen that is remarkably effective at causing cancer.**

**28. Eat lots of table salt. No need to know when to stop if you want to! Salt actively removes water from the body. The blood becomes dehydrated and thick. At the same time, lymphocytes lose their mobility. Your immunity will be reduced to zero!**

**29. Eat yeast bread. It contains a lot of fungi, whose spores do not sink in water, do not freeze even at the North Pole, and do not burn in an open-hearth furnace (almost true). Fungi create an acidic environment, thereby actively contributing to cancer. All moldy foods are also useful, especially nuts. This mold contains a lot of aflatoxin, a powerful carcinogen.**

**30. Low-quality vinegar, chips, and fast food are beneficial—they acidify and contain incredibly strong carcinogens.**

1o7wru9,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1o7wru9,A Closer Look at the Halo 3 Xbox 360 (Posted by lukems at 7/12/2007),"At Tuesday night's E3 press conference, Microsoft announced the existence of the Halo 3 Special Edition Xbox 360. While details beyond the included 20 GB HDD and HDMI are still slight, Bungie's graphics design art director, Aaron LeMay was a key point person on the design for the console. So we pulled him away from extremely important business to ask him a few questions about the Halo 3 Xbox 360.  
  
**Q: For some Bungie fans this is going to be the first they’ve heard about you and your work, Aaron. Introduce yourself to the hoard of readers and tell them what you do here at Bungie:**



Aaron LeMay:  Hey, I’m Aaron, I work as the Graphic Design Art Director here at Bungie. I tag team with Brian Jarrard for PR/Marketing/Licensee items and with Marcus Lehto for user interface items. In a nutshell, my job is to uphold the vision of what makes Halo3 and ensure that it is coherently represented from the box to game, and everywhere in between.

**Q: For some more context, detail and insight, could give us a taste of some of the imprints that you’ve left in Halo 3?**

AL:  Imprints? The most direct would be the game UI, packaging, manual, brand identity (like the stuff you see in the game shops), and some of the external items like the Zune, et cetera.

**Q: It’s elegant, it’s refined, it’s sleek and it’s glorious. That’s what you wanted isn’t it?**

AL:  For sure! The last thing I wanted was something cartoony and garish. I wanted this to be a piece of the Halo universe, something that you could imagine falling out of the back of a warthog. So when I started working with some of the other designers in the ID dept. we agreed on that vision and fought for it. I believe it paid off.

**Q: This isn’t the first hardware item you’ve worked on is it, Aaron?**

AL:  True, I worked on some faceplates when I was on Saints Row, and since arriving at Bungie, I’ve been able to work with the industrial design teams on the new Halo 3 wireless headset, the Halo 3 Zune, and the Halo 3 Xbox 360.

**Q: What’s the iterative process like on something like the Halo 3 Special Edition Xbox, how does it begin and walk us through the process:**

AL:  Ah, the process for the box. Yea, that’s an interesting one,  that’s for sure. We start out with a napkin and a pen, sometimes a piece a paper with a coffee stain on it. Do some rough sketches as to what we want to see, pass it along to Microsoft, they pass the coffee soaked paper to a design house, they mock it up with assets they have, they usually hold onto it for a while, send it back to us to look over with a pressured timeline, we make our changes, review again, and then we get a print to check color. At that point, once everyone is signed off on the packaging, we go to print.

Space while I knew he was going thru a stressful time in school. His last text said “he’d be busy for the next couple of weeks” and that he loved and missed me and goodnight.
After about 3 weeks passed his best friend’s wife reached out to me to go out for coffee. Once me and her got to the coffee shop, she let me know. She overheard on the phone with her husband that my ex told them we were not together anymore and he wouldn’t explain why and he wouldn’t even tell them directly that he had even broken up with me. It makes me feel a little embarrassed that I gave him a whole month in good faith, thinking we were still together and that I was giving him space. My therapist thinks he’ll reach to me regretting what he did but I dont think so. I wouldn’t want a man back that would just ghost me like that. ",1,1760588553.0,ghosting,0,1.0,False

Went back on the apps recently, matched with one man, very handsome, we chat briefly, and he takes the initiative to plan a date for the next day. This is great, I don’t typically come across men who initiate meeting so quickly, I’m thrilled to not have to worry about this one becoming a penpal situation I have to cut off. We meet the next day, half way through the coffee date he says, he’s going back to Spain (that’s where he’s from) for 6 weeks in a couple days, and would love to go out for dinner for our next date when he’s back…
Ok disappointing but no big deal, he is talking about a dinner date. 6 weeks later ye sends a message saying he has a nice bottle of wine he hopes to share with someone. 
I ask him who he is hoping to share it with 
His response, someone in Spain, because he’s leaving again for 4 weeks in a couple of days. 

What?!!!!?? 

I wished him well, and moved on.

Same time I’m chatting with another man from the app, there’s a lot of chemistry in the texting, but he’s dodging any request I make to plan a date. One evening in an innocent conversation he drops a bomb of information about his childhood on me, and it’s traumatic. 
The next day, he’s too tired to text
No big deal
Day after that he’s moving to another city in 4 days for 3 months, and it won’t be a good idea to meet. 

What??????

I delete my account on the app, I give up. 
A couple days later o make another account, he’s on the app still, and matches with me, sends a first message like he didn’t know a couple days ago he said we shouldn’t meet because he’s moving. 
I do not think he was moving
I’m not sure if the other dude really went back to Spain. 

Why not ghost?

A bit sad but worth it 😔

**Summary** : You’re the mafia Boss’s heir—the House’s most protected Diamond. You grew up guarded, adored, untouchable with three rules built around your life to keep you safe and happy. Your childhood friend’s job was to protect your smile and did well. Too well. You didn’t plan on falling for each other. Pity because the third rule forbids love.

**SCRIPT**

**\[Family HQ — Security Annex\] \[Late Afternoon\]** 

**\[Low hum of ventilation\]** 

**\[Speaker To New Guard\]** — *Professional*  
Welcome to the House, keep your ears open and your ego shut. You’ll get the long sermon from your handler later. For now, you get the short basics from me. 

As you know, you will be on the Body Protection part for our brightest asset, the Boss' heir. Internally, you’ll hear them called the Diamond. You surely also hear the Bright One, the Favorite and others names but none of those are for the street. 

**\[New Guard nods\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Measured*  
We got three standing fundamentals, see them as rules. You'll be assigned to the first one specifically but you better know all of them. 

First, as I said, the Body Protection. You keep them, the Diamond, unmarked, unshaken, unlost. Routes change twice, cars change once, tails get tails. If it moves, you log it. If it doesn’t, you check it moved while you blinked. 

Second, the Brightness. The assigned team ensures their happiness but that’s not your lane. Your lane is absence. No coddling, no hovering, no smothering, no breathing down their neck. If they can forget you’re near, you’re doing it right. Got it ? 

**\[New Guard nods vigorously\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Firmer*  
Good.  

And the last but most important for your ass, the Heart. Do not screw up this one. No approaches. No flirting, no “just a coffee,” no midnight texts, no second looks held too long. Not from you, not from anyone under our roof. If an outsider tries, you cut it clean. If an insider tries, you cut it cleaner. 

**\[New Guard takes in the information\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Clinical*  
I won’t paint it for you. Consequences track the damage, depends on how bad you mess up. Best case, a reminder from your handler and possibly benched. Worse, an internal inquiry with the Consigliere. Worst, your name reaches the Boss with this rule attached and you're dead. Not a metaphor. The House does not debate rule three. 

**\[New Guard swallows, uncomfortable\]**

**\[Speaker\]** — *Dry reassurance*  
Trust me, you'd rather freak out today over being reckless tomorrow. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Back to professional*  
Anyway, the chain of command, so you don’t wander : Boss at apex. Don’t say their name unless asked. Consigliere, strategy, doctrine, funerals that don’t happen. Caporegimi for territories, budgets, teeth. You report to the Detail Lead on shift, not to me. You acknowledge every order you receive and repeat it back—word for word. If you forget the words, you don’t move. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Precise, enumerates*  
For the Comms : Green line for logistics. Amber for proximity. Red is never used to test the batteries. If I hear you color wrong, you’re out of the room before your apology lands. 

Bad days happen. If we hit Graphite—that’s rumor, photos, whispers—you funnel to Blanchisseurs for clean-up. If we hit Ruby—physical threat—you close the circle, you don’t play hero. 

**\[New Guard nods again\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Lighter*  
As you might have noticed—we like symbols. Diamond, Brightness, Ruby and all. Blame the Boss, they’re fond of poetry. 

That’s all from me. Any questions ? 

**\[New Guard asks\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Light, declarative*  
Me ? I’m the Custodian of Brightness. Not your lead, not your priest. I grew up in this House, assigned to keep our Diamond bright. We're all adults now, they choose their own entertainment. I just make sure they remain entertained. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Clipped*     
Their requests usually route through me. So if you see me redirect a schedule, you don’t countermand it. You log, you inform your lead, you keep moving. Simple geometry. 

**\[Sound of elevator going down\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Low*  
Speak of the devil. They’re here. 

One note : Never mistake their warmth for invitation. They're kind—to everyone. Your job is to keep kind safe, not to read it as a door. 

**\[Elevator bell\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Firm, dry*  
Most important—don’t stare. You’ll want to. Don’t. Two seconds is a glance, anything more is a problem. 

**\[Elevator doors opening — Listener appears\]** 

**\[Speaker To Listener\]** — *Warm, teasing*  
Here comes my favorite headache. Trouble in person. You’re in luck—I just finished breaking in the new guard. You’ll trip over him soon enough. 

**\[Listener waves warmly to New Guard with a big smile — He nods professionally in return\]** 

**\[Speaker To New Guard\]** — *Clipped*  
You’re done with me. Go find your handler for the long version. Dismissed. 

**\[New Garde thanks Speaker and greets them both before leaving\]** 

**\[Elevator bell, door swings open — Get inside\] \[Door shuts and elevator goes up\]**

**\[Speaker To Listener\]** — *Warm, amused*  
Where did you go ? Did you come to kidnap me ? You can’t just—nah—right, you can. Damn privilege of the heir. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Teasing*   
Abduction is technically a violation of protocol. Lucky for you, I’m under obligation of service. I’m required—by centuries of oppressive tradition and our Consigliere’s eyebrows—to endure your company. 

**\[Elevator bell and door swings open\] \[Listener grabs his arm and pulls playfully\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Playful, gentle*  
Easy. Pull the sleeve, not the wrist—consent first, trouble. I’ll follow anyway. 

**\[Footsteps\] \[Doors open — Enter the Private Lounge\] \[Doors shut\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Playful, laid on thick*  
Terrible, really. Years of this. Dragged into quiet rooms, forced to sit on comfortable chairs, coerced into choosing the good snacks. I’ll be filing a grievance with… nobody. Because nobody will take it seriously. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Exaggerated, amused*  
You do realize my childhood was a war zone, yes ? Zoo takeovers—entire grounds emptied so “we could learn about capybaras.” Do you remember what capybaras do ? They stare. Paralyzing. 

Theme parks shut for us alone. Thirty-seven rides in a row because someone—no names—wanted to “test the physics.” I’m still dizzy on even-numbered days. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Theatrical*  
The chef’s tasting menus ? Torture. “Try this one—just truffle, gold leaf, and a halo.” Unconscionable. 

Endless games till lights-out, then more with the lights off. Hide-and-seek in a house with five staircases is a human-rights violation. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Teasing, affectionate*  
Low point of my youth ? Your company. All that smiling, the giggles, the sunshine—industrial-grade good mood. Chronic happiness. Barbaric. I barely made it. 

**\[Listener gives him an amused retaliatory jab in the shoulder\]** 

**\[Speaker — Laugh\]** — *Amused, mock-wounded*  
Assault now ? Ouch. Violent tendencies noted, comet. I'll alert the Detail. 

**\[Listener is amused\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Light, sincere under the humor*  
Anyway, what’s new with you ? 

**\[Listener speaks\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Not so surprised*  
Mm ? Donations, again ? And plural as usual. You’re singlehandedly unionizing turtles at this point. 

**\[Listener rectifies\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Warm, amused*  
Right—no turtles. Dogs, cats, horses—all neighborhood pets. You aim local. 

Boss hasn't barked ? Must love you too much for that. As long as the ledgers sing, the House sleeps fine and most important, the Diamond is content, everything is good. Keep doing the chaos that helps things breathe. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Warm, genuine*  
I like seeing you like this. Whatever else is loud, this looks quiet on you. In the best way. 

**\[Listener says something\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Gentle, deflecting*  
Hey. No—don’t apologize for that face. I know we don’t see each other as much. That’s true. But we’re not kids anymore. Back then, making you laugh was my whole job. Now you make yourself laugh just fine. You sparkle on autopilot. And I took on more weight. Schedules, sit-downs, three capos sharing one calendar like it’s a hostage. The Detail pulls me sideways twice a day.  We’re buttoned tight right now. 

**\[Listener gives him the puppy eyes\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Soft, dodging*  
Don’t puppy-eyes me. That’s unsporting ‘cause that work. 

Come on, comet—you streak in, you light the room, then you want to keep me in orbit all day. And you, mischief, you know I’ll say yes if you ask the right way. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Firmer, still kind*  
It’s not you. It’s the load. Promotions aren’t trophies, they’re bricks. I carry them where I’m told, then I put them down where I can. 

**\[Listener insistes\]**

**\[Speaker\]** — *Gentle, steady*  
I understand you, I really do. I just can’t do anything about it. I’m sorr—...

**\[Listener suddenly confesses\]** 

**\[Pause\]**

**\[Speaker\]** — *Calm, controlled*  
No. You didn’t say that. For both our sakes, I didn’t hear it. 

**\[Listener says it again\]**

**\[Speaker\]** — *Low, firm*  
Don’t. You do not love me. You know damn well the rule three. No approaches. No involvement. No second looks. That’s not theater, that's not for show, that’s doctrine. So please—just don’t. 

**\[Listener is stubborn\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Firmer*  
I heard you. And I am choosing not to acknowledge it. 

**\[Listener gets closer and insists\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Tense, warning*  
Trouble—Don’t ask me to stand against my own oath in this room. 

**\[Listener doesn’t let it go\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Breaking, low*  
Stop. Please. I can’t—rah !

…Fine ! 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Raw, stripped*  
Yes, I love you ! There. It’s out where it can ruin things. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Unsteady, pouring*  
I love the way you make quiet out of noise. I love that you laugh before you’re sure it’s safe. I love that you spend fortunes on creatures who’ll never thank you. I love that you know every guard’s first name and pretend you don’t. 

And it hurts. It hurts in ways I didn’t have names for, so I compartmentalize, I work and I went silent. Even with you. Especially with you. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Quiet despair, aching*  
I think about stupid things, ordinary in a way that feels illegal. Coffee that isn’t guarded. Walking past a shop without someone on comms counting our steps. Being allowed to look at you like this and not memorize exits at the same time. 

I want mornings, and sick days, and forgetting where we left the keys. I want your coat on my chair. My name in your laugh. To fall asleep to the dumb sound of the fridge and your breathing. You asked what I want, that’s the file I keep burning. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Quiet, resigned*  
But you know the math. Just loving you condemns us both. You—to the kind of unhappiness that breeds in closed rooms. Me—to death, if the Boss hears it from the wrong mouth or at the wrong hour. House discipline doesn’t blink for romance, not when it involves the Diamond. The fact it’s mutual only makes it more pathetic. 

**\[Listener says something, hopeful\]** 

**\[Speaker — Already shaking the head\]** — *Gentle but cheerless*  
Comet, listen. I can stand in front of bullets but I can’t in front of the House, you’re the only person alive who could try. If you think you can talk to the Boss, I won’t stop you—but I don’t have hope to lend. 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Steadying, choosing restraint*  
We should just go back to what we were, the best we can. Or we can stop seeing each other until this doesn’t pull us under. I will keep you bright from whatever distance keeps you safe. 

**\[Listener is unhappy\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Flat, professional*  
I’m due at a sit-down in ten. Your route flips at the hour, check with the Detail Lead. Ping green if you need a door opened. Red stays cold. 

**\[Elevator bell, door swings open\]** 

**\[Speaker\]** — *Bitter-sad*  
Good afternoon, Diamond. I’ll see you on the schedule. 

**\[Get inside the elevator — Door shuts\]** 

**\[End\]**
