Absolutely.,"I worked as a contractor at a government office. Normally, we logged hours in 15-minute blocks. But a new bean-counter manager insisted we start logging our time to the exact minute ‚Äúfor accuracy.‚Äù

We told him this would waste time and wouldn‚Äôt help anyone. He didn‚Äôt care.

So I started tracking everything. I created a spreadsheet broken down by the minute.

8:00‚Äì8:03: Logged in, opened email.

8:03‚Äì8:05: Read email from Jim about printer toner.

8:05‚Äì8:07: Walked to printer to check toner.

8:07‚Äì8:09: Walked back, sent email response to Jim.

8:09‚Äì8:11: Drank coffee.

It took me 30‚Äì40 minutes each day just to log what I did, every single minute. I submitted it proudly.
After three days, I got pulled into a meeting with my manager who begged me to stop. I said, ‚ÄúSorry, I‚Äôm just following your policy.‚Äù
We went back to 15-minute intervals the next week.",1,1750493586.0,MaliciousCompliance,0,1.0,False

In the early stages, I started using Duolingo and Coffee Break French to build up vocabulary and the habit of learning a language. A month later I picked up Assmil French With Ease and have been working my way through it. Currently, I have finished the passive phase (113 lessons) and am on lesson 84 of the active phase. 

Here is my current method: 
1. Assimil French with ease: (1hr 10mins per day)
Shadow lesson 4x (no text)
Shadow lesson 4x (with text)
Read Notes
Make notes of notes
Full translation of Assmil dialogue English ‚Äî> French 

2. Inner French Podcast (30 mins per day)
1 episode per day while out walking
Loop back to episode 1 every tenth episode.

3. Anki Flashcards: (30 mins per day)
All based on Assmil lessons
The audio recordings are on the front card. The text, translation and Assimil notes are on the back card.

4. Reading L‚Äô√©tranger by Camus alongside English translation (15 minutes)
I read a couple of pages a day alongside an English translation.

Ultimately, my language learning goal is to read classic French authors: Sartre, Camus, Voltaire, Proust etc. I‚Äôm just wondering how I could improve my methods. ",2,1750493276.0,learnfrench,0,1.0,False

1lgrb57,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeProTips/comments/1lgrb57/lpt_if_you_cant_make_a_choice_than_force_youself/,"LPT: If you can't make a choice, than force youself to write miniumum 3 negative things and 3 positive things on a paper about both decision and how they would impact your future. You will immediately make a choice.","This trick actually works just take out a paper and write. 

Here's a example, 

I couldn't decide which college to take, on my city (College A) and out of the city (College B)

Now I listen like this:
College A:
Benifits:
Regularly meet my parents 
Regularly meet my friends
Can still live in my room
Can still live my ordinary life as usual
Can still drink coffee from my favorite cafe.

Disadvantages:
Miss out the oportunity to explore a new city
Miss out the opportunity to make new friends
Miss out my the opportunity to live a life without my parents independently. 

College B:
Benifits:
Have better earning opportunities 
Have better chances of getting a good job
Might meet very well educated and cool people 
Experience living life alone 
Have independence because there is no one to stop you you can party till late and do anything 

Disadvantages:
Have to rent a appartment 
Have to make food on my own
Have to miss out hanging out with my friends.

How will both impact my future?
College A: get a comoaritilvely less paying job,  and have problems in the future
College B: Get a greater chance to have a good job and can meet my family and friends once I have graduated and all
So I choose College B!
And that's how making choices becomes easier

And not oly thisz by writing like this in paper, you can ask more bwtterly from a knowledgeable experienced person you know and that person can easily guide you because of hoe clear you have written everything.

And also you can work with the disadvantages to see if they are fixable
For example: Missig friends ‚Üí might make better friends there

I'm a first-timer, currently slogging through Season 6, Episode 16. What began as a random joke to check it out has simply‚Ä¶ unfolded. I've been a witness to all the cringe, the questionable writing, and those moments that just make you stare blankly at the screen.

So imma make a little review on characters.

1. Lorelai :  Spends more time saying that she drinks a lot of coffee than actually drinking it, (same with Food, that she is supposedly hot and that she knows how to raise a kid). Obnoxious and tells jokes that nobody gets. 

2. Rory: difficult drama queen but not as aloud or obnoxious as her mom but at least she tries to be better

3. Luke Dannes: supposedly hates being cheesy but then he acts so cheesy, i like that he always seems annoyed specially when Lorelai starts talking

4. Emily: problematic character but she doesn‚Äôt hide it

5: Richard: classic rich ol‚Äô grandpa with good hairline he is affective to rory

6: Logan Huntzberger: Suprisingly one of the most consistent characters, like more believable although he is a douchebag 

7. Lane Kim: Actually best character not much to complain and prob less cringy character of them all

8. Kirk: the most exasperating person on the planet hope he bites the curb, always an inconvenience to everyone 

9. Sookie: great friend, overreacts when it comes to the kitchen but great character nevertheless 

10: Jess: bad boy with good feelings clich√© most compatible with rory

11. Zack: family friendly kurt cobain wannabe 

12. Michel: another pain in the ass, made a good joke only once

13. Cesar: good hardworking immigrant nothing bad to say about him

14: Ms Patty or whatever tf those fat neighbors names are: they live for Gossip

15. Dean: don‚Äôt remember much of him other than he was the ‚Äòperfect boyfriend‚Äô i think they were toxic to each other 

16. Paris Geller: hate her I find it hard to like her almost everything she says is dramatic, I only like how he treats Logan and when she ran the newspaper cause everyone hated her, then she and Doyle doing Krav Maga  is painful to watch

17 Doyle: At first awkward but you can tell he likes to suffer thats why he dates Paris I mean that‚Äôs the only logic way to be around her

Chapter 1  
  
When Cassidy Morgan opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn at 27 years old.  
  
At this point in her life, she had two children and was married to Gabriel Westbrook, the billionaire CEO who consistently topped the Forbes list and had been named ""The #1 Most Desirable Bachelor"" by TIME Magazine‚Äîa man so sought after that even the British royal family had once hoped to marry their princess to him.  
  
Everyone told her how fortunate she was. Yet the first thing she did after this rebirth was bring divorce papers to his childhood sweetheart.  
  
""I want a divorce,"" Cassidy said calmly, sliding the document across the table to Natalie Hayes. ""Gabriel is yours. The children too. All yours.""  
  
Natalie stared at her in shock, unable to believe that the woman who had occupied the position of Mrs. Westbrook for six years would suddenly volunteer to step aside.  
  
""Since they all prefer you anyway,"" Cassidy added with quiet resignation, ""I'll make it easy for everyone. Just get Gabriel to sign these papers. Once the cooling-off period ends, I'll be gone.""  
  
This time, she refused to repeat her mistakes. She wouldn't continue being the invisible Mrs. Westbrook that everyone overlooked.  
  
Natalie's fingers unconsciously traced the rim of her coffee cup as she frowned. ""What game are you playing, Cassidy?""  
  
""No game,"" Cassidy replied evenly as she observed the shifting expressions on Natalie's face. ""I'm simply done.""  
  
""Do you have any idea how many women would kill to be in your position?"" Natalie challenged.  
  
""I do,"" Cassidy met her gaze directly. ""That's why I'm giving it to you.""  
  
A crack finally appeared in Natalie's perfect fa√ßade.  
  
She studied the divorce papers for a long moment before taking them. ""Well, if you're being so generous, I won't refuse.""  
  
""Just remember,"" Natalie added, ""once I have something, I never give it back.""  
  
""Don't worry,"" Cassidy smiled faintly. ""I absolutely won't regret this.""  
  
After all, in her previous life, she had already tasted the bitterness of a lonely existence.  
  
Natalie moved to another table and elegantly picked up her phone, her fingers dancing across the screen.  
  
When the call connected, her voice instantly softened: ""Gabriel, I'm at Blue Mountain Caf√©. Could you come pick me up?""  
  
Cassidy sat nearby, a bitter smile playing on her lips.  
  
There had been a time when she called Gabriel, only to have his assistant answer nine times out of ten.  
  
Yet now, in less than twenty minutes, the man who was always ""in meetings"" appeared at the caf√© entrance.  
  
Through the glass window, Cassidy watched Gabriel stride in, his tailored black suit accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist.  
  
Six-year-old Ethan and four-year-old Emma immediately spotted Natalie and rushed to her, hugging and kissing her affectionately.  
  
""Auntie Natalie!"" Emma called sweetly, nuzzling her face against Natalie's.  
  
Gabriel placed a cake box on the table, his long fingers gently pushing it forward. ""Matcha, your favorite. I had the chef reduce the sugar.""  
  
Natalie's eyes lit up. ""You always remember the details.""  
  
Cassidy sat in the corner, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palms.  
  
In six years of marriage, Gabriel had never bothered to learn her preferences. In her previous life, when she was hospitalized and craved strawberry cake, he had his assistant buy one randomly‚Äîit turned out to be mango, which she was allergic to.  
  
""What would you like for dinner?"" Gabriel asked, his deep voice smooth and refined. ""French cuisine or Italian?""  
  
Natalie smiled coyly, pulling out the divorce papers from her purse. ""Before that, there's a document I'd like you to look at.""  
  
She flipped to the signature page. ""I've found a house I love, but I'm short on liquid assets. Could you...?""  
  
Gabriel took the pen and signed without even glancing at the content. ""Between us, why keep such formalities?""  
  
""Is Auntie Natalie buying a new house?"" Ethan looked up and asked. ""Dad, you should buy one next door! Emma and I want to live with Auntie Natalie instead of staying with Mom all the time.""  
  
Gabriel's brow furrowed slightly, but seeing the children's hopeful expressions, he relented. ""I'll arrange it.""  
  
""No need to go to such trouble,"" Natalie quickly interjected. ""I'll reserve three rooms for Ethan, Emma...and you. You can visit whenever you want.""  
  
The children cheered, and Emma even hugged Natalie's neck and planted a kiss on her cheek. ""Auntie Natalie is the best! A thousand times better than Mom!""  
  
Witnessing all this, Cassidy felt as though an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, the bitterness and heaviness making it almost impossible to breathe.  
  
She saw the slight upward curve of Gabriel's lips‚Äîa tenderness he had never shown her.  
  
Unable to watch anymore, she grabbed her purse and left.  
  
As she walked through the door, memories of her past life flooded back.  
  
In her previous life, she had entered a business marriage with Gabriel, gave birth to two children, and lived until she was 62‚Äîyet never found happiness.  
  
All because Gabriel's heart had always belonged to his college sweetheart, Natalie Hayes.  
  
When they broke up years ago, Natalie went abroad. Gabriel drowned his sorrows in alcohol for days, but his pride prevented him from chasing her. Instead, he agreed to the arranged marriage their families had planned.  
  
Gabriel had been Cassidy's girlhood dream‚Äîaristocratic, almost god-like. Which socialite in NY didn't dream of marrying the heir to the Westbrook empire?  
  
So when she learned their families were arranging their marriage, she was ecstatic.  
  
But after the wedding, though she poured all her love into their relationship, Gabriel remained distant and cold.  
  
Until Natalie returned.  
  
He never mentioned divorce to Cassidy, yet his gaze never left Natalie.  
  
Worse still, the children also grew to prefer Natalie, gradually becoming distant from their mother.  
  
In her later years, Cassidy was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Gabriel, using ""peaceful recovery"" as an excuse, abandoned her in their old mansion.  
  
On her birthday, her trembling hands dialed her husband and children, only to learn they were vacationing with Natalie in the Maldives.  
  
She tried to bake herself a birthday cake, but in her confused state, forgot to turn off the oven...  
  
As flames engulfed her, Cassidy's final memory was of Gabriel's cold eyes as he placed the wedding ring on her finger.  
  
She closed her eyes in agony, with one wish: if given another chance, she would never again sacrifice her life for him.  
  
When Cassidy returned to the mansion, night had already fallen.  
  
Instead of resting, she immediately began clearing out items‚ÄîGabriel's suits and shirts, the children's toys, family photos‚Ä¶ everything went into cardboard boxes.  
  
""What are you doing?"" Gabriel's voice suddenly came from behind her.  
  
Cassidy turned to see him standing in the doorway with both children, his brow deeply furrowed.  
  
""Why is Mom throwing away our things?!"" Emma rushed over, her face flushing red with anger when she saw her teddy bear being placed in a box.  
  
Ethan glared at her furiously too. ""We were just hanging out with Auntie Natalie for a bit. Why are you being such a drama queen about it?""  
  
Gabriel looked at her, his gaze cold as always. ""The kids prefer spending time with Natalie. Do you really need to throw a fit over something so trivial?""  
  
""I'm not angry,"" Cassidy said calmly.  
  
""Liar!"" Emma screamed. ""You're just jealous of Auntie Natalie! That's why you're throwing away my teddy bear. You're a terrible mother!""  
  
""When I grow up, I'm moving in with Auntie Natalie,"" Ethan grabbed his sister's hand, spitting the words viciously. ""And I'll never come back to see you!""  
  
Gabriel made no attempt to stop the children's outburst. He merely frowned slightly, his deep eyes sweeping dismissively over Cassidy‚Äîas if she were just an unreasonable stranger.  
  
""Enough,"" his thin lips barely moved, his deep voice carrying an innate arrogance as his long fingers casually adjusted his cufflinks. ""I have a board meeting video call. Pack whatever you want, just keep it down.""  
  
The moment the door closed behind him, Cassidy's tears finally fell. Her heart felt torn to pieces, each breath tasting of blood.  
  
She wiped away her tears, looked at the mess scattered across the floor, and suddenly laughed.  
  
Don't worry, she wouldn't disturb him‚Äînot now, not ever again.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After signing the divorce papers, Cassidy stopped managing household chores.  
  
No longer did she rise at 5 a.m. to prepare nutritious breakfasts for the children or stay up late making hangover soup for Gabriel after his business dinners.  
  
All the duties she once considered her responsibility were now left to the servants.  
  
At first, no one noticed the change.  
  
Until Ethan was late for school and got scolded by his teacher, Emma couldn't find her homework notebook, and Gabriel's pocket watch stopped ticking.  
  
The servants scrambled to keep up, yet couldn't match the hostess's standards.  
  
Unwashed dishes piled in the kitchen, children's toys scattered across the living room, and pressed shirts were never quite smooth enough‚Ä¶ the once-immaculate home gradually fell into disarray.  
  
When Gabriel pushed open the bedroom door, Cassidy was leaning by the window, reading.  
  
Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows over her.  
  
""How long do you plan to continue this?"" he stood at the doorway, his voice low.  
  
Cassidy closed her book and looked up at him. ""Continue what?""  
  
""Why have you stopped taking care of the household?"" He stepped closer, the faint scent of ambergris lingering in the air. ""Are you still angry about what happened?""  
  
""I'm not angry,"" she placed the book aside. ""I just don't want to do it anymore.""  
  
Gabriel narrowed his eyes, his long fingers tapping on the table. ""Why?""  
  
""I'm tired,"" she replied calmly. ""We have servants. I don't need to do everything.""  
  
She recalled her previous life, rising before dawn every day.  
  
Gabriel's coffee had to be exactly 85¬∞C, his sandwiches toasted to golden perfection. The children's clothes required hand-washing, even their socks needed perfect pressing.  
  
But what did it get her? Nothing but Gabriel's tenderness toward Natalie, the children's affection for ""Auntie Natalie,"" and ultimately, her lonely death alone in that mansion on her sixty-second birthday.  
  
""Cassidy,"" his voice grew colder. ""If you're throwing a tantrum, just say so. Don't act like a three-year-old.""  
  
She gave a slight smile. ""I'm not throwing a tantrum. I just need a break.""  
  
Before he could respond, the door burst open.  
  
Ethan and Emma charged in, their faces flushed with anger.  
  
""Mom is so lazy!"" Emma shouted shrilly. ""We want Auntie Natalie to take care of us!""  
  
Ethan joined in. ""Auntie Natalie is more loving, more hardworking, a million times better than you!""  
  
Gabriel's gaze remained fixed on Cassidy, seemingly waiting for her to back down.  
  
But she just took a deep breath and said quietly, ""If you think she's better, then invite her over. I don't mind.""  
  
The air instantly froze.  
  
And Gabriel's expression darkened completely.  
  
""Are you sure?""  
  
Cassidy took a deep breath. ""Absolutely.""  
  
""Daddy, let's go!"" Emma tugged impatiently at Gabriel's sleeve. ""I want Auntie Natalie to come right now!""  
  
""Now that we have Auntie Natalie, we don't need you anymore!"" Ethan made a face at Cassidy. ""You can leave this house!""  
  
Gabriel gave Cassidy one last look. Seeing her unmoved, he turned and left with the children, his footsteps heavy.  
  
Cassidy stood motionless, listening to the car engine fade into the distance, and slowly closed her eyes.  
  
Soon, she would grant their wish‚Äîleaving them completely, leaving this house forever.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
Natalie moved in the very next day and immediately ordered the servants to redecorate the living room.  
  
""This sofa is too somber,"" her slender fingers brushed over the leather, turning to Gabriel with a gentle smile. ""Gabriel, can we replace it with something in cream?""  
  
Without even blinking, Gabriel instructed the butler: ""Do as Natalie says.""  
  
Cassidy stood at the staircase landing, watching workers carry out the sofa she had carefully selected just six months ago.  
  
Ethan and Emma followed Natalie like shadows, excitedly pointing at various items. ""Auntie Natalie, these pillows need to go too! Mom bought such ugly ones!""  
  
Natalie stroked their heads affectionately. ""Alright, we'll change everything.""  
  
Cassidy's fingers tightened momentarily before relaxing again.  
  
Those pillows had been hand-stitched by her during pregnancy, filled with hypoallergenic down cotton specifically because the children had sensitive skin as babies.  
  
Yet now they were unceremoniously tossed into the garbage.  
  
In the following days, the house became increasingly unfamiliar.  
  
At the dining table, Natalie sat in what had been Cassidy's place, tenderly serving food to the children.  
  
Gabriel occasionally poured her coffee himself, his long fingers gently pushing the cup toward her, his eyes showing a softness Cassidy had never received.  
  
In the evenings, the living room lights would dim, and the four would huddle on the sofa watching movies: Emma curled up in Natalie's arms while Ethan leaned against Gabriel's shoulder, their laughter constantly filling the room.  
  
When Cassidy passed by, they wouldn't even glance at her, as if she were invisible.  
  
More laughably, Gabriel, Ethan, and Emma had once been impossibly fastidious about their living standards.  
  
But now?  
  
She watched Natalie carelessly toss Gabriel's million-dollar Patek Philippe watch on the coffee table, face down, while he lovingly put it on without complaint. She saw the children happily wearing school uniforms that Natalie had simply thrown in the washing machine, collars still stained with yesterday's sauce. She watched Natalie pass off takeout as home-cooked meals, with none of them calling her out‚Ä¶  
  
Even more absurd was how they pampered Natalie‚Äî  
  
""Natalie, don't touch these chores,"" Gabriel stopped her from clearing the teacups, his long fingers gently pressing on her wrist. ""Your hands are meant for playing the piano.""  
  
""Auntie Natalie, let me carry your bag!"" Ethan eagerly took her limited-edition handbag, his fawning expression something Cassidy had never seen on her son's face.  
  
""Miss Hayes only needs to rest,"" the butler respectfully offered Italian handcrafted slippers. ""Leave everything to us.""  
  
How ironic.  
  
She had been the family's unpaid housekeeper for six years, completely taken for granted. Yet the moment Natalie arrived, she became the princess on a pedestal.  
  
The servants whispered among themselves:  
  
""The master is so good to Miss Hayes, I've never seen him treat Mrs. Westbrook that way.""  
  
""The children adore her too. I bet this house will soon have a new hostess!""  
  
Cassidy had already grown numb, no longer caring about anything, simply quietly packing her belongings.  
  
Until that afternoon when her phone suddenly began vibrating frantically.  
  
""Madam! Young Master and Miss have had an allergic reaction at school! An ambulance just took them to the hospital!""  
  
When Cassidy arrived at the hospital, both children had been rushed to emergency.  
  
Gabriel stood in the hallway, his suit jacket casually draped over his arm, his tie hanging loosely around his neck, cold fury simmering in his eyes.  
  
""Cassidy,"" his voice was low, suppressing rage. ""What exactly are you doing?""  
  
Cassidy was taken aback. ""What?""  
  
""They're allergic to mango. You know that, right?"" Gabriel stepped closer, his tall figure looming over her. ""Why did you let them drink mango juice?""  
  
""It wasn't me!"" Cassidy met his eyes. ""I never bring mango into the house.""  
  
Ever since the children's first allergic reaction to mango landed them in the hospital, she had been incredibly vigilant‚Äîwarning everyone repeatedly about their allergy, even personally reviewing the school cafeteria menus. How could she make such a basic mistake?  
  
""Not you?"" Gabriel sneered. ""Then who? The servants? Or did they try to poison themselves?""  
  
Cassidy opened her mouth to speak, but a nurse interrupted: ""The children are awake.""  
  
In the hospital room, Ethan and Emma lay pale-faced in their beds. When they saw their parents enter, something flickered in their eyes.  
  
""What happened?"" Gabriel demanded sternly.  
  
The children exchanged glances, then simultaneously pointed at Cassidy: ""It's Mom! She bought snacks with mango!""  
  
Cassidy froze, staring at them in disbelief. ""What are you saying?""

1lgr13a,https://www.reddit.com/r/myamazonreviews/comments/1lgr13a/red_flags_in_amazon_product_listings/,Red flags in Amazon product listings,"Bought something sketchy lately?

Same here.

There‚Äôs always a new scam waiting the second you search for anything.

I thought I was too careful to get ripped off.

Turns out, I wasn‚Äôt.

That‚Äôs the confession nobody tells you.

# Amazon‚Äôs fake review problem, it‚Äôs way worse in 2025

Let‚Äôs be honest.

AI reviews? Yeah, they fooled me.

Amazon says they block millions, but scammers just keep coming.

Ever wonder how many people get duped every day?

Probably more than Amazon admits.

# The new red flags, 2025 edition

# The ‚Äútoo perfect‚Äù rating trap

I once bought a cheap kitchen scale with two thousand five-star reviews.

Looked perfect.

It lasted three days.

Every review raved.

Except for the handful buried in the middle calling it junk.

If all the reviews sound the same, or if a bunch show up at once, be suspicious.

Check for the ‚Äúverified purchase‚Äù badge.

If it‚Äôs missing, or there‚Äôs a flood of weirdly similar unverified reviews, that‚Äôs a flag.

Short, boring lines like ‚Äúgreat‚Äù or ‚Äúbad product‚Äù mean nothing.

Real people never write that way.

Brushing scams are everywhere.

Ever get a random package from Amazon?

I have.

Found my name on a review for a product I never bought.

# The generic brand shell game

If the brand only exists on Amazon, skip it.

I fell for this once.

Couldn‚Äôt find their ‚Äúcompany‚Äù anywhere, not even a dead Facebook page.

A week later, the charger I bought melted.

That was fun.

If you see the same ‚Äúbrand‚Äù on totally different products, it‚Äôs probably a fake.

# Quick signs the brand is a shell:

* The brand has no real website.
* The same ‚Äúbrand‚Äù name appears on kitchen gadgets, socks, and phone chargers.
* Google gives you nothing but Amazon links.

# Review hijacking and catalog abuse

Seen reviews for headphones on a water bottle listing?

Yeah, that‚Äôs hijacking.

ASIN swap is the trick where sellers keep the old reviews and just change the product.

If the reviews are all for something else, or people mention buying a totally different thing, trust your gut.

# Seller red flags nobody tells you about

Brand new seller with no history?

Not fulfilled by Amazon?

Wants you to pay for shipping both ways?

That‚Äôs the classic trap.

Once got a sweater like this.

Looked great.

Fit like a doll‚Äôs costume.

Couldn‚Äôt return it.

# Price and urgency scams

I nearly bought a ‚Äú$150‚Äù power bank for $20, except the ‚Äúsale‚Äù never ended.

It‚Äôs always ‚Äútwo left in stock.‚Äù

But somehow, two left every day for weeks.

If the bundle sounds vague or you‚Äôre not sure what‚Äôs in the box, you‚Äôll probably regret it.

* Fake countdown timers
* Too-good-to-be-true sales that never end
* ‚ÄúOnly two left‚Äù warnings that reset daily

# The phone scam evolution

My aunt actually called me last month.

She got a call from ‚ÄúAmazon‚Äù saying her account was at risk and she needed to buy a gift card.

Amazon never asks for that stuff.

Hang up.

Nobody‚Äôs account ever got fixed with a gift card.

# How to actually spot fake reviews in 2025

Read the three-star reviews.

Those are the ones that saved me.

Sort by ‚Äúmost recent.‚Äù

Oldest reviews usually miss the new problems.

Google the brand.

If nothing comes up, don‚Äôt trust it.

Stick to ‚Äúverified purchase‚Äù reviews.

If the majority are not verified, something‚Äôs off.

Try free tools like ReviewMeta or Shulex VOC, since Fakespot is dead, you need something.

# Protect yourself, my go-to checklist

* Look for a mix of review scores, not just five stars.
* Scan for review clusters, tons posted at the same time.
* Search the brand outside Amazon.
* See if the seller is new or return policy is weird.
* Always read the three-star reviews first.

# What Amazon says they‚Äôre doing, and why it‚Äôs not enough

Amazon blocks fake reviews, over two hundred fifty million last year.

They sue fake review websites and add AI.

Still, it‚Äôs a mess.

Sixty percent of reviews in some categories are fake.

The FTC is finally stepping in.

But let‚Äôs be real.

Nobody is looking out for you except you.

# The bottom line for 2025

If it looks too good to be true, it probably is.

Manual review is your best defense.

Tools help, but nothing beats a skeptical scroll through the mid-star reviews.

Trust your gut.

I have had ear pain, facial pain and regular headaches for over five years. I saw three ENT consultants and they all said nothing was wrong. About a year into this, I developed chronic pelvic pain. I went through the usual barrage of tests and treatments with a urologist but nothing helped. I also saw a pelvic pain specialist with no results.

Recently, I had a wisdom tooth removed and the surgeon mentioned I clench my teeth a lot. I have another one coming out soon under IV sedation. During this process, the doctor said I most likely have TMJ.

Over the past week, I have been researching all of this myself and I am starting to think there might be a connection. I am a very anxious person and I wonder if I am clenching both my jaw and pelvic muscles during the day and in my sleep.

Has anyone else experienced this?

But when that plan gets canceled ‚Äî especially last minute ‚Äî it stings. And not in a dramatic, over-the-top way. It stings quietly. Slowly. Deeply.

# ü§ç Because the plan wasn‚Äôt just a plan.

It was something to[ look forward to.](https://www.elitestartup.club/saral-transport/)  
A reason to get up, get ready, and *step out of routine*.  
A break in the noise of your internal monologue ‚Äî a signal that ‚Äú[Hey, you exist beyond work, chores, and your phone screen.‚Äù](https://www.elitestartup.club/saral-transport/)

Maybe it was just a coffee.  
Or a quick dinner.  
Or catching up with someone after weeks of ‚Äúlet‚Äôs plan something soon.‚Äù

But in your mind, you‚Äôd already:

* [Picked an outfit](https://www.elitestartup.club/saral-transport/)
* Rehearsed conversations
* Imagined how you‚Äôd laugh, vent, recharge

So when that small message comes ‚Äî ‚ÄúHey, can‚Äôt make it, sorry‚Äù ‚Äî it doesn‚Äôt just cancel an hour from your day.  
It cancels a [whole emotional build-up](https://www.elitestartup.club/saral-transport/) you didn‚Äôt even realize was there.

#  What actually hurts when the plan crashes?

It‚Äôs not just disappointment. It‚Äôs what it [represents.](https://www.elitestartup.club/saral-transport/)

# 1. Feeling unimportant

You start wondering: *Was I the only one who was actually looking forward to this?*  
Maybe they said yes out of politeness. Maybe they didn‚Äôt really want to come.  
And just like that, self-worth gets caught in the crossfire of a canceled meet-up.

# 2. Loneliness, resurfacing

In busy lives, plans are rare moments of social oxygen.  
Cancel one, and you‚Äôre back in your head, scrolling, overthinking, and feeling like you‚Äôre on the outside of everyone else‚Äôs fun.

# 3. The emotional drop

You were at an emotional high. Now, you crash.  
Not because someone hurt you intentionally ‚Äî but because your mind had already emotionally *arrived* at the place the plan was supposed to happen.

#  You might try to shrug it off:

* ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, next time.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre probably genuinely busy.‚Äù
* ‚ÄúI‚Äôll just chill at home instead.‚Äù

But there‚Äôs a moment ‚Äî a[ quiet, empty pause](https://www.elitestartup.club/saral-transport/) ‚Äî where you realize how **badly** you wanted that human connection.  
And that silence is what hurts.

#  It gets worse when it keeps happening.

When multiple plans fall through.  
When you‚Äôre always the one suggesting, always the one checking in, always the one **hoping** someone else will value your time too.  
You begin to **stop asking**. You become the person who replies ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure‚Äù or ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs see‚Äù because you‚Äôve been let down before.

You start protecting yourself with indifference, even if you‚Äôre **starving** for connection deep inside.",1,1750491324.0,u_Difficult_Appeal1373,0,1.0,False

I‚Äôm a tall (187 cm) guy, with dark hair and blue eyes. I have a strong build with a little softness around the middle‚Äîsomewhere between gym-fit and cuddle-ready. I‚Äôm also on the hairier side, just being honest right from the start. :)

I live somewhere between M√ºnchen and Starnberg, and I try to keep life simple and meaningful. I like to stay active, spend time in nature, and make space for the small things that bring joy and peace. I speak English, German, and Turkish. I enjoy anime, manga, and board games‚Äîanything a little nerdy that brings people together. If that sounds like your kind of fun, or if you just enjoy relaxed company and a good laugh, there is a good chance we will get along.

I am hoping to meet a lady who lives in or near M√ºnchen or Starnberg, and who is looking for something real and long-term. Physical connection matters to me, and I tend to feel that spark more easily with women who are naturally slim, fit, or average in build. I want to be upfront about that because I believe honesty makes things easier for both sides.

It is also important for me to share that I would love to have a child of my own one day. I know that may seem a bit personal for a post like this, but it is something I value deeply, and I think it is better to be clear about that from the beginning.

I am not interested in endless online chatting or long-distance relationships. I prefer getting to know someone in real life‚Äîgrabbing a coffee, going for a walk, and just seeing if we vibe. :)

There is a photo of me on my profile, so you can put a face to the words.

If anything here speaks to you, I would be genuinely happy to hear from you. :)",1,1750491248.0,MeetPeople,0,1.0,False

I feel like im going insane,"Was told to repeat the test closer to 7am and no meds or caffeine (fast) before next test. I'm just so upset I have to wait even longer for results because that's longer to get treated. I even called the lab beforehand asking specific questions 
(Me: ""what's the cutoff time for giving the sample?""
 
Idiot: ""you can do it any time""

Me: ""...okay do I need to fast?""

Idiot: ""no""

Me: ""..   so coffee is okay???""

Idiot: ""yes I said you don't need to fast"" 

Me: ""oh... OK thank you "")

The only reason I finally got her to test me after all these years of low energy, no motivation, hypersomnia, depression, mood swings, etc. Is because I've recently started feeling like I'm going insane and can't sleep without benzos recently. I've tried everything. 

Now whenever I get up and walk around I get heart palpitations, feel like I'm going to collapse, get mildly confused/can't remember things well, and sweat profusely. 

Idk what is going on with my cortisol (its looking like secondary adrenal insufficiency because all my other hormones are low, too. Testosterone, estradiol, progesterone, DHEA-S, shbg, etc.) But I'm so upset I was close to getting results on the ACTH but it needs to be redone, prolonging whatever treatment.


Night time/evening is so bad. I get incredibly restless and have auditory hallucinations, my brain feels like scrambled eggs and I can't remember things. I've made more mistakes at work in the past month than the past 3.5 years I've been there. 

Is 1.1 really that bad or am I just being dramatic? I feel what I feel, I don't think im being somatic, something is awfully wrong and I don't know how long I can manage til I just pass out or something ",2,1750491128.0,AdrenalInsufficiency,2,1.0,False

It‚Äôs currently June 21st, so I‚Äôm still in the middle of my trip; and it‚Äôs been 7 days since my surgery.

I‚Äôm Chinese-Canadian and came to Korea for the summer. I had been considering eye surgery for a while, and I started researching clinics through Google. My mom was also doing her own homework and came across this clinic on Reddit, which gave both of us more confidence. After reading a lot of positive reviews, we decided to go for an in-person consultation.

One of my biggest priorities was finding a clinic that wouldn‚Äôt give everyone the same cookie-cutter double eyelid looks. I wanted something natural and balanced; an eye shape that still felt like me. I was also looking for a clinic with strong experience in eye procedures and one that took a personalized approach to each patient. This clinic checked all those boxes.

The head doctor, Dr. Jung Min-Su, performed my surgery. From the very beginning, he made me feel comfortable and safe. He listened closely to my concerns, explained every step in detail, and didn‚Äôt try to push any unnecessary procedures. That level of care and transparency really stood out to me.

The surgery itself went smoothly. I chose the non-incisional method with ptosis correction. Honestly, when I first looked in the mirror afterward, I felt like I looked crazy; the swelling was intense. But now, a week later, it‚Äôs starting to go down, and I can already see the shape forming. The line looks clean and even, and I‚Äôm excited to see the full results.

One thing I‚Äôve really enjoyed is going back to the clinic for red light deswelling treatment. The clinic is located right in the middle of Gangnam, so I made a little routine of stopping by for the treatment, then exploring or grabbing a coffee nearby. It made recovery feel more relaxed and even a little fun.

The clinic doesn‚Äôt book too many surgeries in a day, which I appreciated. It never felt rushed, and I always had time to ask questions and feel heard.

As a side note; while in Korea, I also dyed my hair for the first time! I‚Äôve been treating this trip as a full refresh, and honestly, I feel really good about it.

I speak both Mandarin and English, so I chatted with the translators at the clinic. Everyone was super friendly, but I felt more comfortable in English, so I worked with the English-speaking translator throughout the process.

I‚Äôm planning to share more once I hit the one-month mark, but so far, I‚Äôm really happy with the results and the experience. If anyone‚Äôs thinking about doing something similar during a visit to Korea, feel free to ask me anything.",1,1750491083.0,SeoulPlasticSurgery,1,0.67,False

1lgqmty,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1lgqmty/doing_a_little_work_on_my_new_book/,Doing a little work on my new book.,"# Introduction: The Truth That Sets Us Free

You‚Äôre scrolling through Reddit in 2025, and a heated thread in r/philosophy catches your eye: ‚ÄúTruth is whatever you make it. Live your truth!‚Äù The top comment reads, ‚ÄúYup, my truth says I‚Äôm a billionaire, so where‚Äôs my yacht?‚Äù The replies explode with laughing emojis, but the OP doubles down: ‚ÄúNo, seriously, everyone‚Äôs truth is valid.‚Äù Another user chimes in, ‚ÄúSo, if my truth is that I don‚Äôt owe you for that virtual coffee you sent, we good?‚Äù The thread descends into chaos, with upvotes flying and memes sprouting like digital mushrooms. It‚Äôs a perfect snapshot of our age: relativism sounds cool until someone tries to skip the bill.

This Reddit-style spat mirrors a real-world coffee shop debate I overheard recently. Two friends, Sam and Riley, were hashing out truth over lattes. Sam said, ‚ÄúTruth is personal. What‚Äôs true for you isn‚Äôt true for me.‚Äù Riley nodded, ‚ÄúTotally, live your truth!‚Äù Then Sam grinned, ‚ÄúSweet, so my truth is you‚Äôre paying for my coffee.‚Äù Riley‚Äôs face fell. ‚ÄúDude, that‚Äôs not how it works!‚Äù The barista, barely hiding a smirk, muttered, ‚ÄúGood luck with that ‚Äòtruth‚Äô thing.‚Äù The exchange was hilarious, but it hit a nerve: if truth is just ‚Äúmy vibe,‚Äù how do we settle anything?

John 8:31‚Äì32 offers a better way: ‚ÄúIf you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free.‚Äù Jesus doesn‚Äôt pitch a pick-your-own-adventure truth; He offers *the* truth, rooted in God‚Äôs reality. In a world where ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù dominates X posts and Reddit threads, this book, *And Then You Will Know the Truth‚Ä¶*, argues that relativism‚Äîa belief that truth, love, and tolerance are subjective‚Äîturns these concepts into flimsy knock-offs of their Biblical originals. Through humor, stories, and some serious brain food, we‚Äôll show why God‚Äôs Truth, Love, and Tolerance beat relativism‚Äôs shaky imitations every time.

# A Meme That Hits Home

Imagine this X post blowing up in 2025: a cartoon shows two Redditors arguing over a giant number on the ground. One sees a ‚Äú6,‚Äù the other a ‚Äú9,‚Äù and they‚Äôre yelling, ‚ÄúMy truth is the only truth!‚Äù The caption? ‚ÄúWhen ‚Äòlive your truth‚Äô meets reality.‚Äù A speech bubble from a bystander says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a number, folks.‚Äù The meme racks up thousands of likes, with comments like ‚ÄúLMAO, this is why relativism‚Äôs a mess‚Äù and ‚ÄúNah, both truths are valid!‚Äù The irony is thick: even the relativists assume their take on the meme is *right*. As C.S. Lewis put it, truth isn‚Äôt a mood swing; it‚Äôs a map to reality (Lewis, 1952). John 14:6 backs this up: ‚ÄúI am the way, the truth, and the life.‚Äù God‚Äôs truth doesn‚Äôt shift with your angle‚Äîit‚Äôs the number itself.

# Why Truth Matters in 2025

The Reddit thread and coffee shop banter aren‚Äôt just funny; they expose a glitch in our culture. X posts and r/popular hot takes push ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù for everything‚Äîidentity, morality, even science. A 2025 post might read: ‚ÄúMy truth is my gender, and no one can argue.‚Äù Cool, but what happens when ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù clashes with ‚Äúyour truth‚Äù in court, school, or a Reddit mod fight? Without a shared truth, we‚Äôre stuck in digital shouting matches. Francis Schaeffer nailed this in *How Then Shall We Live?* (1976), showing how Enlightenment doubts and postmodern vibes gutted absolute truth, leaving us with fragmented worldviews. Christianity counters with a truth that‚Äôs like gravity: real, whether you vibe with it or not.

Take another story: Mia, a college freshman, sits in a philosophy lecture where the prof drops, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no absolute truth.‚Äù Mia, channeling Greg Koukl‚Äôs *Tactics* (2009), pipes up: ‚ÄúIs that absolutely true?‚Äù The room cracks up, and the prof fumbles. Mia‚Äôs question, straight out of John 8:32, sparks a late-night dorm debate. Her roommate says, ‚ÄúTruth is what feels right.‚Äù Mia shoots back, ‚ÄúFeelings change. What if truth is like Wi-Fi‚Äîyou connect to it, not invent it?‚Äù Psalm 119:160 answers: ‚ÄúThe sum of your word is truth.‚Äù Mia‚Äôs classmates start rethinking their ‚Äúlive your truth‚Äù mantra, craving something solid.

# What‚Äôs This Book About?

*And Then You Will Know the Truth‚Ä¶* dives into three big ideas‚ÄîTruth, Love, and Tolerance‚Äîshowing how relativism warps them into cheap copies. We‚Äôll explore:

* **Truth**: God‚Äôs reality (John 14:6) vs. ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù chaos.
* **Love**: Sacrificial care for others‚Äô eternal good (1 John 4:8) vs. ‚Äúwhatever feels good‚Äù vibes.
* **Tolerance**: Respecting others‚Äô right to opinions while holding to truth (Ephesians 4:2) vs. ‚Äúeverything‚Äôs valid‚Äù mush. We‚Äôll give relativism its best shot with strong arguments, then unpack why it flops using brainy moves from Koukl, Turek, Craig, Zacharias, Lewis, Moreland, McGrath, Pearcey, and Schaeffer. Expect history lessons (Schaeffer-style), X post breakdowns, and stories that hit home. This isn‚Äôt just academic flexing‚Äîit‚Äôs a guide for navigating a world where truth is up for grabs.

# Why Keep Reading?

If you‚Äôve ever rolled your eyes at a ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù post, argued with a friend over what‚Äôs real, or just felt lost in 2025‚Äôs noise, this book‚Äôs for you. We‚Äôll laugh at relativism‚Äôs quirks, dig into God‚Äôs truth, and find hope in John 8:31‚Äì32. Absolute truth isn‚Äôt a buzzkill; it‚Äôs the key to freedom. So, grab a coffee (maybe pay for it), and let‚Äôs dive into why God‚Äôs Truth, Love, and Tolerance are the real deal.

# TL;DR

* **What**: Intro to *And Then You Will Know the Truth‚Ä¶*, a book defending absolute Truth, Love, and Tolerance against relativism‚Äôs weak sauce.
* **Why**: Relativism‚Äôs ‚Äúmy truth‚Äù mantra sounds freeing but causes chaos (e.g., Reddit fights, coffee shop debates).
* **How**: Humorous stories (coffee shop spat, Mia‚Äôs class clapback), a viral ‚Äú6 vs. 9‚Äù meme, and Bible verses (John 8:31‚Äì32, John 14:6) show absolute truth wins.
* **Next**: The book unpacks Truth, Love, Tolerance with history, apologetics, and X post vibes, proving relativism‚Äôs a poor imitation.
* **For Reddit**: If you‚Äôre tired of ‚Äúlive your truth‚Äù nonsense, read on for laughs and logic. Thoughts? Drop ‚Äòem below!

1lgqlmo,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1lgqlmo/tread_lightly/,Tread lightly.,"Today has been an absolute shit show. 90% self-inflicted, to be sure, but sometimes shit just happens and you can either get mad about it or laugh it off.

I woke up early today, 04:05. *Way* earlier than the first of my alarms. My brain was cooking from slamming mouthwash last night and the thirst demanded quenching. I considered just rolling over and trying to get another 40 minutes of sleep to see if that could do anything to alleviate the running tiredness I've felt since Monday morning, but I didn't want to chance it in the event I fell into a deep slumber and sleepily swiped off my alarms. That and I wanted to *drink*.

I pissed away those early hours drinking and smoking on the porch. I wasn't really thinking about the passing of time, where I should have gotten certain things done by certain times, like making lunch, finding today's work shirt, rolling up my clutch of cigarettes for the day etc. Aside from getting in the shower early on I kind of just dragged my heels, listening to music and glugging the mouthwash. I wasn't....resentful of work or anything, but this morning I just did not have that focus and drive I had, like before, to power through and do what had to be done. I was *exhausted* from the ongoing lack of proper sleep, and I'd just flipped the drunkover switch as soon as I started pounding the blue stuff again.

Me being me, I left it all to the last minute and then tried to do everything all at once. Monumental error, I was drunk and not as diligent about timekeeping as I should have been. The deadline for leaving home and still being able to catch the bus - even running if I had to - came and went. I had a little bit of cash saved for an emergency Lyft ride, in the event I did actually wake up late one morning, as I feared, but as I had been getting into work well on time every day, I had intended to use that cash for a beer taper this weekend. I was embarrassed of myself; I didn't wake up late, it wasn't an emergency; I fucking woke up *early*, and I'd just spent the last couple of hours chilling and drinking until I drained the bottle. Foolish.

The Lyft ride was surprisingly cheaper than I expected, and with a CA's mentality I was relieved to count I still would have had enough for another bottle of mouthwash after work today. I got in just on time, but the moment I stepped out of the vehicle I knew I'd over-reveled that morning. I was hammered. 

Productivity for the morning went down the toilet along with my blue-green ass piss. I was falling asleep at my desk, hard. Like I felt on the verge of actually laying my head down on the desk and snoring away. I cradled my chin in my hand a few times and it was lights out for a few seconds before I jerked awake again and clumsily pretended to not be sleeping. I'm at the back of the room, so no one could really see my face as I was nodding off - but the two supervisors on shift are behind me, so they *may* have seen my head nodding lower, may have seen my elbow slip off the chair arm rest, may have heard me gasp as I woke myself up.

I was losing the battle and nothing I tried for wakefulness helped - not repeatedly splashing water in my face, in the bathroom, not 3, 4, 5 black coffees, not a cheeky secret cigarette and a brisk walk around the parking lot. As soon as I loaded up another case and tried to actually be productive I could feel my eyelids inexorably closing, my head drooping down, the random boners embiggening. 

I decided to have a breather and go take another shit. Not just to pass the time, but because the mouthwash was wreaking havoc on my empty stomach. I passed out in the toilet stall then. I couldn't stop my eyelids from shutting, my body leaning forward, and I ended up folded over, forehead on my knee. No idea how long I was down, but I shot up when I heard the bathroom door open. I wasn't sure if that was someone coming in or out. With those typical American bathroom doors, anyone who went to use the toilet I was in would have seen me passed out, through the half-inch gap between the toilet door and walls. I wasn't really worried about it being one of the two other lads in my group - I said yesterday I had observed they themselves were prone to strategic toilet breaks throughout the day. I was more worried about having been spotted by the new male supervisor on shift. He didn't say anything when I came back to the office floor, but that didn't stop the all-day anxiety over bathroom sleepy time. One of my first jobs, on returning to the States, I had passed out in the bathroom and only *very* narrowly avoided getting busted by a manager who came looking for me. 9 years later and I'm still fucking around like that.

Withdrawals came for me around lunch. They had been creeping in earlier as the week progressed. Monday, I was fine until the very end of my shift; today they struck when I was barely halfway through my day. Surely a sign of a compromised liver. My heart started racing, and I felt like I wasn't drawing enough air in with every breath, so I was gasping like a fish at my desk. I had to get up and pace around the building, try to slow my thundering heart, reassure my brain that my lungs were still functioning normally and I wasn't suffocating. The few times I had to speak to the supervisors I had to hold my head a certain way or it would start shaking like I was a bobblehead. 

I just wanted out of there. I should have been a more diligent CA this morning and drank medicinally, instead of going ham and having none left over to take in to work, or be there when I got home. Now I was in full-blown withdrawals and desperately trying not to panic as I knew the last 3-4 hours of the day would feel like fucking *forever* to get through. 

As the day wore on I agonized over my post-work plan of attack. I knew I was only going to get worse, and considered how wobbly and non-functional I'd be by day's end. Was I actually up to going out of my way to the grocery store, for that last bottle of mouthwash? Would I be so bad I'd have to settle for a Steel Reserve and some cheap ass tall boy from the local gas station instead?



When the end of shift rolled around I still hadn't decided on my course of action, but as I could see and hear people winding down for the day I did the same myself. First move: take off work shoes and swap out for sneakers for the walk to the bus. I clamped down on the heel of my right shoe with the toes of my left, and made to pull my foot out. Instead - *SHRIIIIP*. The fucking sole tore off at the heel. Goddamnit I forgot this happened at my last job and I had to wedge my shoe under a filing cabinet, after gluing it, to reattach the sole. 

Not to worry, I'll deal with it later, just put your sneakers o- I grope around in my backpack for my sneakers and get the sneaking suspicion they're not there. I pull the bag out from under my desk and open it fully up. They're really not in there. *Because you got a Lyft into work, you fucking idiot*. Oh shit. Because I was on drunk autopilot this morning I just popped my smart shoes on and left the sneakers in my bedroom. I didn't even think about the journey home. 

Sigh. Not to worry. I might move a bit slower getting to the bus stop, but it's my own fault for leaving my sneakers at home. 

As I leave the office I can hear the *shlup, shlup, shlup* of the dangling sole slapping my heel as I walk. It's a little embarrassing, but I'll live. As I make my way to the bus stop the sole gradually becomes more detached, peeling off halfway through. Oh for fucks sake. The *shlup, shlup, shlup* now becomes an audible slapping sound as the sole is only barely attached to the shoe under the ball of my foot. Distantly, I wonder if I look as absurd to passing drivers as I feel.

I'm about a quarter of a mile out from work, crossing the street, when my shoe clips a curb and the sole just comes off completely. I stagger. Did that just fuckin happen? Sure as shit, there's the sole of my shoe in the street. I pick it up and step on it, thinking maybe it will attach somehow. I put weight on the sole, this way and that, and step off. The sole stays on the ground. 

Ok, shit, what am I gonna do now? I absentmindedly reach into my bag for my sneakers again before I remember they're at home. I can....what? Take off the shoe and walk around? Erm...wrap my shirt around the shoe? I lean against a wall and examine the bottom of the shoe. The fabric is thin and doesn't look like it can survive the long walk to the bus stop. What else can I do though? 

I cautiously carry on walking, thinking it doesn't matter; just go get your booze and get home. The shoe will make it. Only it doesn't. You know how they say you should test the surface temperature of the ground, in hot climates, before taking your dog out for a walk? It's been years since I've had a dog and it's not something I've thought about in the intervening time - the ground gets *hot*. It was 113¬∞F here today; the hottest it's been in years. As I walk, awkwardly, my right foot starts to warm up. As I said, the fabric at the bottom of the shoe was pretty thin, and on the journey more and more pieces came off the bottom of the shoe, especially as I unthinkingly trod over gravel and it embedded in the bottom of the shoe. The pavement has been soaking up that Arizona sun all day and warm quickly becomes hot, and then scalding. It's like stepping on a heated stove top. 

Eventually I start hopping, favoring the intact shoe on my left foot; even momentary contact with the sidewalk is searing hot. To make matters worse, in my drunken haste to leave the house this morning I didn't have time to locate 'proper' socks so put on some tiny sport socks of CAG's; the low rise of the sock means nothing is protecting the back of my left ankle, and the more I hop around, the back of the shoe starts to tear into my ankle. I can feel it's rubbed raw and weeping, but there's nothing to be done for it. The ground is simply too hot for me to put my foot down.

I limp into a bus stop that's mercifully shaded by a large tree behind it, and consider my options. I can't make the full journey to my bus stop. Even hopping from shaded spot to shaded spot I am moving at a snail's pace and there's no real significant shade cover, so even a bit of sidewalk that's shaded by a citrus tree swaying in the breeze is still painfully hot through my shoe.

I have to wait until sunset. That's the only thing I can do. Idly, I check my Lyft app and see if I can get home, but I've only got $6 and the ride home is triple that. Withdrawals are ramping up as well. I can feel my resting heart rate thundering up and my vision is getting a little blurry. It will be hours until the ground is cool enough to walk on with my busted shoe. What to do until then? God, I wish I hadn't drank all the mouthwash this morning and I somethign to sup on to pass the time.

*Something to sup on*. I was actually going to stop at the grocery store halfway between home and work, for my last bottle of mouthwash. Bonus: it's an east-west bus I get home from there, and those are every 15 minutes, not 30. What if....

I check Lyft again and, miracle of miracles, I can get a ride there for just under $6. Fuck yes! I limp over to an easy-to-find business and book the ride. Granted, that means no more mouthwash, but I can use the last of my food stamps to get some extract for mixers when I get there, and the bus stop for home is like 3 minutes away from the grocery store. Sure as fuck beats lurking at a down town bus stop until sunset, thirsty and withdrawing.

I don't fuck around when I get to the grocery store. I just head straight to the baking section, busted shoe making comedic *crunch, crunch* noises from the bits of gravel and glass embedded in it, and do some mental arithmetic to determine how many of those bad boys I can get with the last of my food stamps. There's a shelf-stacker there, who I didn't initially see. We make eye contact for a moment after I eyeball the prices of the various extract flavors. My shopping cart is empty, I'm two-strapping a backpack, wearing a sweat-soaked tank top, and my red-rimmed eyes speak of sleepless nights and demons in bottles. It's obvious I'm not there to bake a fuckin cake.

I grab as many of the extract bottles as I can afford - 6 - and make my way to the nearby bus stop. It's in a plaza, of sorts, so there are a lot of shaded shop fronts and the sidewalk isn't scorching hot as I walk along. bus stop is empty and I can have a chill smoke while I wait for the ride home. I can only laugh at how this abomination of a day ended. 

The final trudge home is silent but for the *crunch, crunch, crunch* of the stones and glass in my shoe grinding together as I walk the final stretch home after getting off the bus. I can't even listen to music, my brain is that fried from the day. I'm relieved to throw the fuckin shoe off as soon as I get home. The fabric under the ball of my right foot has just completely disintegrated so I was walking on concrete/sidewalk at some point on the journey home. The tissue on my foot feels irritated af so I think I'm due for a giant blister I'll have to lance tomorrow, but what a fuckin day!

(but is politically very f‚Äôd up)

I‚Äôm almost always in a mall in the dream. but not a nice mall, a smaller one with a disappointing selection of shops. something always tells me don‚Äôt go back in there it‚Äôs creepy and you hate it, but then I do. sometimes it‚Äôs the only way to get from A to B. the people around me there seem mostly male and to be lacking souls, and don‚Äôt talk.

during the dream, and after waking up, I have a gross taste in my mouth. kinda sulfuric, a combination of milky coffee and rotten eggs. it is very very prominent.

it‚Äôs weird cuz the experience is very sinister and evil but not overtly dark or scary, but rather a sneaky, hedonistic kind of evil. like everything could be colorful and nobody is mean but it‚Äôs soulless and creepy.

anyone have any thoughts or similar experiences? I hope this is an appropriate subreddit, the experience feels very esoteric and occult to me",1,1750489718.0,spirituality,1,1.0,False

1lgqhga,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgqhga,Sourdough Kouglof for Weekend Breakfast,"After weeks of experimenting with hydration rates, whole wheat, and the ever-elusive open crumb, I took a sweeter turn this weekend: a sourdough kouglof for breakfast. The result? A golden, buttery loaf with just enough tang from the levain and enough fluff to make a croissant jealous. My family devoured it (almost!) before the coffee finished brewing.

The toasted almonds and rum flavoured raisins made every bite feel like heaven in pastry form. Thought I‚Äôd share the recipe in case anyone‚Äôs up for treating their morning crew this weekend. You don‚Äôt need a kouglof mold to try this (though it does make it extra charming).

Levain:
- 25g mature sourdough starter
- 50g all-purpose flour
- 50g water
Mix and let ferment until doubled and bubbly.

Dough:
- 600g bread flour
- 120g sugar
- 15g salt
- 150g unsalted butter, softened
- 3 eggs
- 200g milk (room temp)
- All the levain
- 120g raisins (soaked in rum)
- 18  almonds (if kouglof mold)

1. Mix flour, sugar, salt, eggs, milk, and levain. Knead until it comes together.
2. Gradually knead in softened butter a little at a time. The dough will become smooth, shiny, and elastic. Knead until window pane. 
3. Fold in raisins.
4. Bulk ferment until double in size.
5. Grease mold with butter and put almonds on bottom of the mold (if using). Put dough in the mold.
6. Let proof at room temp until it rises to the top of the mold. 
7. Bake at 180¬∞C for 50‚Äì55 mins.
8. Brush with melted butter and dust with powdered sugar while still warm.

I'm 40 years old, single, no friends, no living family and working dead end jobs week to week. Sounds like a horror story right? It's just my life. 

 I was going through the classifieds in my local paper in Boulder, Colorado. McDonald's, ABC Cinema, Domino's, man these all suck. 

Then as my ink stained fingers flip to the next page of the piss stained newspaper, something caught my eye. Circled in an old coffee stain was an ad that read 

‚ÄúRemote night shift security job. No experience required. Wage $20 /hrs. Travel covered.‚Äù

That was a bit peculiar to me. I seriously contemplated what I was going to do for the next month to make rent in my run down studio apartment situated directly above a busy night club.

As the beat to Pink Pony Club thumped through my floorboards, rattling my teeth I thought ‚Äúfuck it.‚Äù I called the number, 1-861-485-4557. 

A man named Bob answered the phone. I could hear the burning of the end of a cheap cigar on the other end. The grissly yet soothing voice of Bob said ‚ÄúBob here.‚Äù

I was confused, who answers a work phone with that? 

I replied ‚ÄúUh, hi, my name is Eric. I'm calling about your ad in the paper.‚Äù

 Bob responded after having an episode of his smokers cough. ‚ÄúWhere do you live?‚Äù 

‚ÄúBoulder‚Äù I replied.

‚ÄúBoulder hey? That'll do.‚Äù 

I was confused I asked Bob ‚ÄúWhere is this job? I saw it said travel covered.‚Äù 

Bob pulled a long haul off of his cigar and I can hear the ice of his whiskey on the rocks colliding with the sides of his glass, a sound I'm familiar with as my only friend is Mr. Jack Daniels. 

Bob replied ‚ÄúKaniks. The travel is covered. What's your address I'll have a car meet you tomorrow at 3:00pm.‚Äù

I gave Bob my address and he hung up without saying another word. I didn't know what just happened I don't know if I need to pack anything in particular. 

I decided to load my cheap backpack I still had from high-school with my toiletries and a couple pairs of sweat stained T-Shirts, ripped pants, holey socks and boxers with just enough fabric left to cusp my balls so they don't stick to my thighs. 

The next day I wake up around 1:00pm and I felt like I slept for a week. I'm not sure what happened but I couldn't care either. 

Between the weekday night club under me and the sounds of desperate young guys trying to blow their load over a cheap drink and a smile sleeping all day was better. 

I showered, grabbed my bag and turned off my lights, the one outside my door started flickering ‚Äúgreat another thing to fix‚Äù I sighed to myself.

Running my hand through my balding hair as I lock my door and go down the old dirt stained wood stairs.

Sitting idle was a black Chevrolet Suburban with windows blacker than the void inside of me. Nobody stepped out to greet me so I opened the back door ‚ÄúKaniks?‚Äù No response. 

I got in. I asked the driver again if this was for Kaniks and I received no response, not even a look. The doors locked and he put the car in drive and drove away. 

Beside me on the middle leather seat was a yellow card with black sticky ink on it ‚ÄòEric‚Äô

I flipped it over and read the words written by the liquid ‚Äòthe driver isn't paid to interact, I hope you understand. See you soon, Bob‚Äù

I looked at the driver, he barely looked over 16 but he drove like a true professional, like he'd been driving for 100 years. He knew where cars were in his blindspot without ever looking in the mirrors.

I watched as the broken neon lights of the shitty dive bars on Hanson Ave laid still on at 3:00pm.

The drive was completely silent, I never even saw the driver shift his eyes to the rear view mirror to look at my existence. 

About 2 hours later we drove past a sign which said ‚ÄòKaniks Colorado, your gateway to the Rockies‚Äô 

I watched as we drove right through the town and turned onto a dirt road. 

It was noticeable as my water was now shaking violently inside it's container. Trapped, and would always be trapped unless I opened the lid. 

I lost track of the turns and the ups and downs of the Rockie Mountain roads. But then we pulled into an open dirt lot and the car stopped. 

The driver unlocked the doors but refused to move his body or eyes from the driver's seat. I opened the door, grabbed my Jansport backpack by the handle with an old mustard stain. 

I stepped out and as soon as the door closed the man drove away, disappearing into the winding roads of the wooded mountains. 

A black Cadillac ATS was parked idle just 200 feet from me. I assumed this was similar to the Suburban so I approached. 

The sound of gravel crushing under my feet with the sound of tree branches dancing in the breeze. As I reached for the handle I heard that sound that I couldn't forget. 

The slow burning sound of tobacco leaves. It was Bob, somehow I didn't see him but there he was, right beside me.

Bob stared at me with a grin of true pleasure. ‚ÄúEric! I'm so glad you made it. Please let me give you an introduction of the job.‚Äù


Bob started off as I'm sure he always has.

‚ÄúSorry about the quiet drive and minimal information, we can't have people knowing where this site is. The water treatment plant here feeds the entire town of Kaniks and the town is very protective of it as they swear it's the best water they've ever had. But hey, I don't ask questions as long as the paycheques keep coming.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo problem‚Äù I replied. 

Bob began showing me around the small site. 

‚ÄúWe're standing in the parking lot and over here is the water treatment plant.‚Äù 

It was a bunker style build covered in overgrown weeds and patches of grass and dead dandelions. 

‚ÄúHere's the only door to the facility, your job is not to go in here because you don't have the proper training and insurance coverage, your job is to just watch the door from the Jeep. If there's any issues you call me and I'll make the decision for what to do next. Call me anytime you need,  I'll answer. I'll always answer. Lunch is on me today, it's in the Jeep.‚Äù 


My shift started right then and there, it was 6:00pm by this time. 

Bob got in his ATS and drove away into the Rockies. 

I walked over and sat in the Jeep Cherokee that they had left idle for me. It smelt like cigarettes and old cum. The seats were an odd mix of crunchy and sticky. 

The first few hours were extremely uneventful. I watched as the florescent light flickered over top of the entry door. This reminded me of Hanson Ave and that stupid light at home I now needed to fix, the only thing missing was the scent of Axe and cheap perfume from Sephora. Then it would be home. 

As I reminisced about the nightmare I came from I heard a loud banging coming from the treatment plant. It scared the shit out of me. I'm not going to lie. 

I watched as with every bang the light flickered. 

After about 10 minutes it stopped. Back to the silence of nature. My ass was sore and my legs were killing me. I stepped out to get some fresh air and stretch my legs. 

I walked up to the door and noticed something. The light. It was a bit dimmer than I'd remembered. I looked at the light and noticed that of the 1 foot long bulb a section of about 2 inches was burnt out. Completely black. 

I went back to the Jeep and decided to check out the lunch they gave me. It was a nice lasagna that was being kept warm by the lunch box being plugged into the cigarette lighter. It tasted amazing. It was the first time in weeks I've had something that wasn't a microwave dinner. 

I was feeling a bit tired and figured there's nobody else out here and no cameras so I should be able to get a quick nap in before shifts end. I closed my eyes and was awoken by that banging sound again. 

I looked at my watch and it was about 5:00am. I had 1 hour to go in the shift and I must've fell asleep for about 5 hours. 

I watched as the light flickered with every loud bang. The banging was definitely coming from inside the plant I was sure of it, where else would it come from? 

I got out of the Jeep and walked to the door. As I got closer I looked at the bottom of the door which had about a half inch of light coming from within. 

One loud bang sounded and I thought I saw a black shadow run across the door light from within but I figured I was tired so I rubbed my eyes and looked back up at the light. 

The light again was a bit dimmer. When I inspected it I found the black void on the bulb was about 4 inches now instead of 2.

As I stared into the void of the light I heard the sound of gravel crunching under tires. I turned to look, the Suburban had arrived again, presumably to pick me up. 

I walked up and grabbed the cold plastic handle of the back door and stepped inside placing my bag between my legs. The driver did a 3 point turn and began leaving the lot. 

I asked if I was going to be driven home. Of course the driver didn't answer or acknowledge me. I should've known better. 

Before I knew it I was back on Hanson Ave looking at the broken neon lights. I then found myself home staring at the stained wood stairs before walking up and going right to bed. I was exhausted. 

I woke up the next day and proceeded to do the same process. 

I grabbed a snack and slung my backpack over my right shoulder. I walked down the stairs and got into the Suburban. We drove back to the lot and I got out and went over to the Jeep. I put my bag in the passenger seat before sucking the last bit of fresh air before sitting in the Jeep. 

I began passing time by reading a couple newspapers I brought with me. Reading how the Rockies were doing just a month into the season, they suck, surprise. 

A few hours had passed and I was dozing off. Just as I was almost asleep I heard a scream. The scream you hear when someone's loved one dies and they refuse to accept it. It scared the shit out of me again. 

I looked around from within the Jeep but I couldn't see anything out of the ordinary. Just that the fluorescent light was flashing again.

The screaming stopped and I called Bob. ‚ÄúBob here‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was someone screaming and I've been hearing banging from inside the plant‚Äù I bet I sounded fucking crazy. 

‚ÄúIt's a water treatment plant Eric, it's going to make lots of noises. The banging is just the machines and the screaming was probably just the squealing of belts. Anything else?‚Äù 

‚ÄúNo‚Äù I replied. 

Bob then hung up. 

I frustratedly looked to the sky and I thought about the light.  I don't know why but I did. I walked over to the door and looked up. ‚ÄúFuck me‚Äù I muttered to myself. 

The light's void was now 6 inches in length. I thought this had to be more than a coincidence. 

Nothing else happened that night and I was driven home by the driver. 

I began looking through web links and old texts about the town of Kaniks and the water treatment plant. No surprise I found essentially nothing. Essentially that is. 

I did find one article from 1983. It talked about how the town had a natural spring running through it but somehow an unknown chemical compound was found in the water, making everyone sick. The town then built the water treatment plant and diverted the spring into the plant. There it would filter and process the water and produce clean drinking water. The technology seemingly was why they were so protective of it. Which is understandable. 

There was no more info on what the chemical was or where it came from. I went to bed but I couldn't sleep for shit. 

Eventually it was time to go back to the site. I got back in the Suburban and before I knew it I was back at the town driving through. I told the driver I wanted to stop in town and look around. The driver finally acknowledged me. He turned to me and reached into his suit pocket and pulled out an envelope which had ‚ÄòEric‚Äô on it. He handed it to me without saying a word. 

I took it and inside was $500 cash and a note. 

The note read ‚ÄòEric, good work so far. The town called and thanked us for our efforts with a payment bonus and I decided to give you part of it.‚Äô 

I thought to myself well fuck I'm not going to complain about this where else would I make $500 a in 2 days work. 

The driver dropped me off at the Jeep and I began passing the time with newspapers. 

A couple hours later I looked back up at the door and I saw the black lines about 2 feet apart blocking the light under the door. 

I turned the high beams on in a panic and the lines were still there. It looked like someone was standing on the other side. I got out of the Jeep and began walking to the door cautiously. The breeze of pine air surrounded me. 

I stood just feet from the door and stared at the door. As I moved my feet to the side of the door the person inside followed. I jumped in fear and the line seemingly jumped too. I yelled like a dog getting his tail stepped on.  

The light began to flicker faster and faster and faster. I ran back to the Jeep and locked the doors. 

I watched as the person's shadow inside turned and walked to the side of the door before disappearing into areas I couldn't see. 

The light stopped flickering. My curiosity overruled my nerves and I had to go look. I had to look at the light. 

I got out of the Jeep and slowly crept towards the light and wouldn't you know it. The void was now 8 inches. A significant amount of the florescent eggshell white light was now black. 

I knew now there was something weird going on here. Was it just a person inside messing with me? It seemed to mirror me. Why? What were the banging noises, was the scream of this person trying to get my attention? I had to know. 

I touched the door lever and took a deep inhale of the pine air and pulled. I pulled the door harder than anything I ever had because of the anticipation and fear. But it was locked. I fell right on my ass. 

I just sat there staring at the door. That's when I noticed it. I wasn't sure how the door was locked. It had no key hole and no noticeable locking mechanism. 

But Bob told me this was the only door and I've walked around there's no other doors or points of entry. Frustrated, I kicked the door as hard as I could ‚ÄúFuck!‚Äù As I started to walk away I heard a voice. 

I stopped dead in my tracks. I could feel every hair stand at attention and I could feel my face turning white. My shadow began to disappear and reappear to disappear and reappear constantly. The light.  

I turned around to see the light flickering like the brain during a sseizure. Then a bang so loud I felt it in my chest sounded off and the light stopped flickering. I immediately shifted my eyes up and looked at the light. 10 inches. The void was now 10 inches. All but 2 inches remained of the light. 

I heard the gravel breaking under tires and I turned around to see the Suburban. I was confused. I didn't think it was time but it was. What felt like a couple hours turned into 12. I jumped in and drove back in silence.

I got home and realized I forgot my god damn bag. Great. I had nothing else to bring shit with. I scrounged and found an old grocery bag and put some new reading material in it. 

I tried to sleep but I couldn't. Who or what was that? 

I tried to search on the web again but I couldn't find anything. And I mean anything. 

Even the original write up on the plant I found was no more. I knew I needed answers, For once in my life I felt like maybe I could help someone or finally make a name for myself. Maybe then someone anyone would like me.

I grabbed an old pry bar my dad left me and I waited for the next shift.

The next day I went back to the site, I hid the pry bar in my pant leg and the driver still acted as if I didn't exist. I didn't want to tip anyone off. 

I waited until it got dark and at 1:00am I decided this was it. 

I walked up to the door, trembling so much it was hard to even see. I pulled out the pry bar and placed it on the doors frame. I felt the vibrations of the plant inside. I took a deep breath in ‚Äúfuck it‚Äù I jammed the bar into the door frame, pulling and pushing and twisting as hard as I could. The light started to flash again but I didn't give a shit. I yelled all of my energy into what I was doing. The bar slipped and I fell on my face. 

The light went completely black as it seemingly finally burnt out. 

I looked up at the door to see that half inch of light from under the door. As I looked I noticed something. The light went around one side of the door now. ‚ÄúHoly shit I opened the door.‚Äù

I slowly pulled the door open and looked inside. It was normal. 

I haven't seen many water treatment plants but from what I gathered it was totally normal. Gauges, switches, water tanks, the sound of machinery and belts whining. But on the floor was some water. 

I almost couldn't breathe when I realized there were footsteps. Water footsteps. 

I grabbed the pry bar and took another deep breath, this time it tasted more chemically like walking into an indoor pool after a kids party. 

I followed the footsteps to a water tank. I thought for sure I was going to come across an employee who fell in and was just wet trying to get out. 

I looked around and saw a sign, it had the phone number I had called but it had written in a black liquid ‚ÄúIt kills‚Äù the same black liquid as was on my welcome card in the car.

I walked for what felt like an hour, around corners, down stairs until I saw it. A water tank that had a yellow sign on it. 

My bones almost fell out of my skin when I read it. ‚ÄòEric‚Äô. 

I turned to run away but when I turned I ran into something solid. I looked up and there was Bob. 

Bob smiled and I tried to run again but he grabbed me. I kicked and tried to free myself. Bob had me with such a strong grip I couldn't get out. He walked me over, holding me, to my tank. Inside was a black liquid. 

I screamed and Bob just laughed maniacally. 

Bob said ‚ÄúThis was the best $500 I'd spent this year. You have no family and you're never going to missed. Eric, this town had a chemical outbreak caused by a small meteorite hitting the spring. The chemicals had never been from this world.‚Äù 

I panicked and looked around for any way to get out, I knew I was probably dead. 

‚ÄúThere's only one thing that neutralizes the deadly chemical. Flesh. The flesh of humans coming into contact with the black liquid we call Orion's Blood makes it safe for the town folk to drink. It's like a fountain of youth. They never seem to age and maintain near perfect health! You were the next sacrifice Eric. Thank you‚Äù

I remembered the pry bar was still in my hands. 

I snapped out of being frozen in fear and I shoved it through Bob's stomach as hard as I could. ‚ÄúAhhhhh!‚Äù A scream matched by myself and Bob. I could feel the warm blood of Bob running down the pry bar onto my hands. ‚ÄúFuuuuck off!‚Äù 

The weight of Bob's dying body was too much for me to hold and his body pushed us backwards. After all I was only 5'8"" and 160lbs.

I fell and I immediately felt hot all over and itchy. I realized I was in Orion's Blood. 

I tried getting out by the surface tension was unlike water, it was more like quicksand. The more I moved the further down I went. I was getting so hot it felt like I was melting. I knew this was it. 

I looked around as I slowly sank into the liquid, dying. I realized there were more tanks. All with the same yellow signs with black writing on them. ‚ÄòMatt, Ashley, Sam, Wendy' the tanks went on and on and on forever. 

I felt something I hadn't felt in forever, a tear. I began crying, sobbing. 

All of these people forgotten. And now me.

1lgqf7x,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgqf7x,Sourdough Kouglof for Weekend Breakfast,"After weeks of experimenting with hydration rates, whole wheat, and the ever-elusive open crumb, I took a sweeter turn this weekend: a sourdough kouglof for breakfast. The result? A golden, buttery loaf with just enough tang from the levain and enough fluff to make a croissant jealous. My family devoured it (almost!) before the coffee finished brewing.

The toasted almonds and rum flavoured raisins made every bite feel like heaven in pastry form. Thought I‚Äôd share the recipe in case anyone‚Äôs up for treating their morning crew this weekend. You don‚Äôt need a kouglof mold to try this (though it does make it extra charming).

Levain:
- 25g mature sourdough starter
- 50g all-purpose flour
- 50g water
Mix and let ferment until doubled and bubbly.

Dough:
- 600g bread flour
- 120g sugar
- 15g salt
- 150g unsalted butter, softened
- 3 eggs
- 200g milk (room temp)
- All the levain
- 120g raisins (soaked in rum)
- 18  almonds (if kouglof mold)

1. Mix flour, sugar, salt, eggs, milk, and levain. Knead until it comes together.
2. Gradually knead in softened butter a little at a time. The dough will become smooth, shiny, and elastic. Knead until window pane. 
3. Fold in raisins.
4. Bulk ferment until double in size.
5. Grease mold with butter and put almonds on bottom of the mold (if using). Put dough in the mold.
6. Let proof at room temp until it rises to the top of the mold. 
7. Bake at 180¬∞C for 50‚Äì55 mins.
8. Brush with melted butter and dust with powdered sugar while still warm.

It‚Äôs basically dessert disguised as breakfast, and no one in my house is complaining. Would love to hear what others have tried in the enriched sourdough world.

I love Mathematics, Programming, history reading Fiction and making notes - Would love to meet people with similar or different interests","I have always been a lover of knowledge and wisdom. I've loved gleaning new insights and perspectives about the world, enrichening my understanding of a new subculture and weaving more details into my mental models.

I love the accompanying novelty rush on learning something new. I love the satisfaction of having articulated an interesting thought. The digestion of new information always excites me.

Having said that, I am not in the least interested in going back to college. Formal education kills the excitement of learning and instead burdens with various tensions like exams, grades, assignments, deadlines and so on. I love learning free and unencumbered from it.

I've always thought learning begins more after leaving school or college. I would like to connect with other people who have a similar mindset - discuss our daily systems and habits to stay in touch with learning about the world

I realised how much I love learning about things while discussing books with somebody and revisiting my non fiction collection. I have books on all kinds of curiosities - ranging from the history of colour to the reason the English alphabets are organised in the order they are (not phonetically like most languages).

I would love to interact with people who have similar passions and exchange good articles and insights everyday with each other - and feed our interest further.

Subjects I like learning about

* **Mathematics**¬†\- I love Mathematics. I don't have as much time to keep up with it actively now, but I do read articles on Quanta to keep up with latest development.
* **Programming**¬†\- I love participating in programming contests
* **Chess**¬†\- I am not very good in chess, but I love it. I have so many books on chess that I still have to read ! I follow various YouTubers on it
* **Reading**¬†\- I do like reading books - both fiction and non fiction.
* **Sports Trivia -**¬†The way I consume sports is through remembering and analysing trivia. I find it fascinating that almost every sporting event will lead to something happening that has not happened before.

There are various other topics I am interested in - even if I am not an expert in them like¬†**psychology, history, international affairs**¬†and so on.

Mediums I like to keep track of information from

* **Podcasts**¬†\- I do love listening to podcasts. I recently heard a podcast about the differences between natural an lab made diamonds and learnt about the economics of the jewellery industry. I listen to podcasts about science outreach, international affairs an a few fictional ones too in my native language.
* **Books**
* **Blogs**¬†\- I follow some blogs like Quanta
* **Magazines**¬†\- I have subscriptions to¬†**MIT Technology Review, Wired and New in Chess**. I also follow some free magazines like¬†**IEEE Spectrum and Resonance.**
* **Reddit -**¬†I try to curate my feed to get new bits of information now and then. I have found out about things as esoteric as a world coffee championship through Reddit.

I love organising things I learn in notes in beautiful ways. I maintain notes about it - though I am not always regular in updating it. I would love to know about different systems other people have and learn more.

1lgqdy7,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lgqdy7,Reminiscing. A year ago today my hiking buddy and I tackled stage three of the WHW. Rowardennan to Inveranen.," Well after a day off trail keeping the wives happy exploring Stirling and Doune Castles, getting soaked to the skin (coldest wettest June on record remember) and finishing off the day with a magnificent tour of Deanston Distillery, my hiking partner and I returned to the WHW.

Starting where we finished previously at The Clansman, we headed off into light drizzle.

Drizzle turned into rain, and we opted for ‚Äòthe high road‚Äô. Raincoats on, raincoats off as we ascended. All too soon we were at the track junction above Rowchoish Bothy and the slog over rocks and roots had begun.

Initially, we did not find the scrambling difficult, but we were very slow and cautious. We were easily the slowest group on the trail. Met a large group of lads from Edinburgh who were ‚Äòfast packing‚Äô with ultra light kit. Several had skimped on wet weather gear and were blue with cold. We offered a couple of them drams from our flasks which were gratefully accepted.

We got to the Inversnaid Hotel too late for breakfast and too early for lunch. The coffee and cake and a chance to sit in a comfortable seat were welcome. It was strange sitting in a rather plush bar/dining room wearing just socks on our feet. It was easy to tell the walkers from the house guests. A word of warning from my hiking partner - don‚Äôt use the gentlemen‚Äôs conveniences wearing just socks.

We stopped for a rest at the ‚Äòoak leaves and acorns‚Äô. During this break we were treated to the sight of the of the RAF Red Arrows doing a low pass along the loch. My mate and I are ex (Aus) Air Force, so this brought a cheer from both of us.

Just north of that break, we encountered something alien to us. Cold humidity. We could not believe how thick damp and still the air was in forested areas at only 12 degrees celsius.

Feck, does this day ever end? Again, while we were tiring, we were more frustrated by the need to travel slowly and place our feet carefully. Oh how we envied the young ones striding by more confidently than us. We stopped to let one young lass with green hair slide by. She was ‚Äòin the zone‚Äô and she quickly disappeared from view, even in those areas where we could see a distance ahead.

We stopped for another break at the last little beach before the trail takes its final farewell from the loch. Oh boy, was getting back up onto our feet hard for these two old blokes.

Climbing away from the loch we encountered our first bout of what we came to refer to as ‚Äòwalking up a fecking stream‚Äô. Where despite no rain for an hour or more water continued to pour a half inch deep down any pebbly uphill section. This became a feature of the remainder of our walk. 

Another break at Doune Bothy and we met a eclectic bunch. A German man who had  broken his hiking poles (which doubled as tent poles) was lamenting he had to stay in the bothy rather than walking on. He was happy to know he could pick up new poles in Tyndrum at the end of the next day. We met some Kiwis who were taking a break from hiking the Te Aeoroa trail by hiking in Scotland. Go figure.

The final ascent from Loch Lomond started to test us as were now very tired. My blister from day one had started playing up again. So glad to be able to take ‚Äòthat‚Äô photo looking back over the loch. 

But red hell, Beinglas and Inveranen were still a long way off. During a forested part of the descent into Inveranen we were passed by a bunch of teenagers on mountain bikes. They had travelled from Drymen that day. How the ‚Ä¶.. they got their bikes along the northern part of the loch is amazing. They were quite strung out and one poor bloke had a flat tire.

At last Beinglas was in front of us. We stopped to get our passports stamped and realised that we had forgotten to get them stamped at Inversnaid. NO WAY were we walking back for that stamp I can tell you.

By the way, who‚Äôs stupid idea was it to meet the wives at the Drovers Inn rather than Beinglas? Oh wait, it was mine.

The girls had done us proud. They had a table, they had beers and a dram of whisky and they had a plattter of carbs waiting for us.

We caught ip with dozens who had passed us on the trail that day. With our two days on/one day off schedule, we did not pick up a ‚Äòtrail family‚Äô but we did meet a lot of memorable characters.

I didn‚Äôt have anything against them‚ÄîI just didn‚Äôt want to be talked to. I sat a couple of benches away, trying not to make eye contact, hoping no one would approach me. 

Thankfully, they didn‚Äôt. I‚Äôve heard that many JWs in the UK these days just direct people to the website rather than engage directly.

It wasn‚Äôt about them specifically. I wouldn‚Äôt have wanted to be approached by anyone‚Äîevangelicals, Muslims, charity fundraisers. I just didn‚Äôt want anyone to want anything from me.

What‚Äôs interesting is that I do really enjoy visiting monastic communities‚ÄîCatholic monasteries, mainly. Monks and nuns, at least the ones I‚Äôve met, never seem to need anything from you.

They seem like the least needy people ever! They‚Äôre not unfriendly, just... peacefully detached. 

That lack of neediness appeals to me, maybe because I used to be evangelical myself, and remember the pressure to always be trying to persuade people of something.

Anyway, just a thought. I wonder if most people feel the same‚Äîthat folk don't avoid folk because they are religion, but the fear of being sold something they don't want and that neediness.

1lgqd7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1lgqd7d/slovenia_underrated_gem/,Slovenia - underrated gemüá∏üáÆ,"
heyy, im coming with a trip report, this time i had an opportunity to spend 5 days in a BEAUTIFUL country of üá∏üáÆ!

üöçGETTING THERE - First i was looking at flights from my country ( Czech Republic ) but it was pretty expensive and inconvenient, since there were no direct flights and Slovenia as a small country doesnt have many airports. Gladly the country isnt that far, so i found direct Flixbus from Prague ( it goes from Berlin, through PRG, Linz and Bled ) price with return ticket was 71‚Ç¨ and took about 9,5 hrs to get to the Ljubljana.

üè°ACCOMODATION  - Since i wanted to go bit on budget, i decided to book a hostel. Specifically ‚ÄúDragons Dream Capsule Hostel‚Äù ( 25min walk from the train station ) which was also my first time in a capsule hostel. You have your have own capsule with private locker outside and bathrooms were shared, but there were 6 rooms with shower and toilet in the bathroom, which you can lock, so that was pretty cool, even though you were in hostel, you could have your privacy. Price was about 62‚Ç¨ for 4 nights, it was ok for the stay, but not really a big fan. 

üöäTRANSPORT - In terms of Ljubljana, there are only busses on which you can buy tickets directly from machines or through Urbana card app, but honestly i didnt take a single one cuz city is totally walkable! 

Regarding Slovenia as a whole, you can take busses or trains. Although the country is not covered the best in terms of public transport, it will get u to the most famous spots ( or near them ), its comfy and clean. So as a tourist i find that totally ok. Though, i would rather go for ‚Äúrent a car‚Äù option, cuz you can visit all the places easier, faster and dont have to rely on irregular schedules to some places. 
+ if you travel on weekends you have 75% discount on all tickets!!!

üá∏üáÆPLACES - Now i will give a summary of places i managed to visit!

üêâLJUBLJANA - Ljubljana is a cute city with beautiful historic preserved buildings and awesome walkability! Its a great city for art lovers, because there are many museums, art shops and smaller galleries.
You can take walks around the canal in the center and take a seat in many coffee shops, restaurants or pubs along the way, its so charming especially in the warmer months! 
Other than that city has big young population as well, so i would say its really worth it to explore for young people! 
 
Things to see 
- Ljubljana castle ( its soo nice in the evening with the lights )
- Many bridges ( Dragon bridge, Triple bridge )
- Pre≈°eren square
- Ljubljana market ( fresh produce, every day from 7am - 16pm except sunday )
- Tivoli park ( huge park with zoo and some hikes as well )
- Kongresni trg ( historic square )
- Miestni trg ( square with the town hall )
- Saint Nicholas‚Äôs Cathedral
- AKC Metelkovo ( alternative city filled with underground culture, graffiti and art )
- Trubajerova cesta ( cool street with graffiti, shops and restaurants ) 
- Museums ( Slovenian national gallery, etnografski muzej, Narodni muzej Slovenije )
+ Also since im a huge football fan, i visited match of Slovenia against Slovakia, it was really cool! 

‚õ™Ô∏èLAKE BLED 
The infamous place, that you see on all the photos and postcards. Honestly, even though its a touristy place, you have to see it! There is lot things to see and do. You can visit the castle, go on the canoe around the lake, go hiking, cycle and list goes on. Personally i only did the free stuff, you dont really have to go the castle or the island on the lake to have good views and enjoy ur time! 

Things i did
- Hiked Ojstrica & Mala Osojnica ( incredible views, really worth to climb it, paths are preserved as well. Osojnica takes 30m, Ojstrica 15m )
- Vintgar Gorge ( saw just glimpses, cuz it was not open yet, but it looked really beautiful )
- Triglav National Park ( only national park in Slovenia! Walked a path around the mentioned Vintgar, pretty cool hike around to the hill, really peaceful. people were just walking their dogs and enjoying the day ) 
- Slap ≈°um ( small waterfall, free of charge! Its actually at the end of ‚ÄúVintgar gorge, so if u go the same way, you wont miss it. Loved the clean water and fresh air around it )
+ there are also other beautiful places around Bled like Pokljuka or Doma≈æle, but only had one day and was really tired after walking all day hahah

+ i really recommend to just take a whole day and walk around all these places, if u can, because u will not only see the sights, but also AMAZING landscapes, mountains and nature all around!!!

üèñÔ∏èPIRAN - Piran doesnt really seem like a typical Slovenian city, rather Italian one, thanks to its proximity to the borders with Italy. Sea around, architecture looks like Italian one, narrow alleys, terrain is more Mediterranean, lot of seafood restaurants and signs translated into the Italian language. Overall its really historic old city with different things to see and do ideal for a day trip, its only 2hrs from Ljubljana.

+ city has castle walls dated to 7th century! You can visit them, the price is 3¬£ and you get an amazing panorama of the city from there, trust me!!

üèîÔ∏èLAKE BOHINJ - Im not affraid to say, that Bohinj is even more beautiful than Bled and less touristy. There is a beautiful lake around ( even bigger than the one in Bled ), different hikes, mountains all over, breathtaking picturesque views and again the spectacular clean water! Its like 2hrs from Ljubljana, but totally worth a visit!

Things i did
- Walk around the lake ( i walked from Ukanc to Ribƒçev Laz and it took me under 2hrs with stopping and just looking at the mountains. Terrain is more rocky, but you will see awesome views and some parts are like from LOTRü§© )
- Ukanc ( there are some cottages and apartments there with the mountains behind it, awesome views as well! Also nearby is a cable car to the ‚ÄúVogel‚Äù, i didnt go tho, because it was 29‚Ç¨ with the return ticket, but i heard that panorama is breathtaking! )
- SLAP SAVICA ( then i visited waterfall Savica. Let me tell you, you need to visit this one!!! You can hike there from Ukanc, it takes around 1hr, but you will go through forest and see great landscapes, mountains and vintgar running next to the hills. But in terms of slap, its really one of the best nature beauties i saw, its pretty big and since its at the top of a climb, you can just look at it and listen to its sounds, enjoy the look and vibe for minutes, ahh loved that!)
- Ribƒçev Laz ( It is a village or a touristic facility, where the lake starts. You can find hotels there, restaurants, picturesque spots and also ‚ÄúChurch of Janeza Krstnika‚Äù, good place to start or end the trip! )
+ unfortunately i didn‚Äôt have enough time to visit Mostnica Gorge or Seven Lakes Valley, but still really worth it!

 + Keep in mind that there are many other beautiful places i did not visit like Predjama castle, Velika Planina, Postojna cave or city of Maribor.

 üç≤FOOD - Varies from the region, but the more traditional ones are their Goulash for example, variety of soups, Kranjska klobasa or dessert ones. There is also big influx from other Yugoslavian countries, so you can find food like ‚ÄúBurek‚Äù, ‚Äúƒåevapi‚Äù or ‚ÄúPleskavica‚Äù around. The ones i tried for example were ‚Äústruklji‚Äù ( slovenian dumplings ), famous ‚Äúkremna rezina‚Äù( from Bled region, creamy and sweet, delicious!) and mentioned‚ÄúBurek‚Äù( great streetfood option and only around 3-4‚Ç¨, very filling imo! )
The cuisine was not my most favourite one, but enjoyed it quite a bit! 

Recs - Burek Olimpija Ljubljana
- ≈Ωmauc Ljubljana( alternative pub )
- Cutty Sark Pub Ljubljana
- My dumplings of Slovenia Ljubljana ( struklji )
- Confectionery Zima Bled ( cream cake )
- Fritolin Pri Cantini Piran ( great seafood for affordable prices )

üí∂PRICES - Slovenia uses ‚Ç¨ as a currency, so thats pretty convenient since many countries in Europe use it. In general the prices are not that bad, but it isnt the cheapest either. Draft beer will cost you 3-5‚Ç¨, streetfood like Burek or Pleskavica around 3-5‚Ç¨ too. If we are talking about regular restaurants it ranges from 10-30‚Ç¨ even in the touristy places like Bled or Bohinj. In terms of attractions it depends, some are more expensive ( like Bled castle, or canoe to the island ), but some like Ljubljana castle or museums in general are around 10-15‚Ç¨, which is not that bad. So in overral you can save a lot money and have a great time too, but on the other hand if you want to, you can please yourself in this country, since it also has lot of luxuries like 5*hotels, resorts, michelin restaurants etc. 

üá∏üáÆSAFETY - Slovenia is a very safe and clean country, didnt have a single problem even in late hours as 24 y.o male in all places. Sure, sometimes you will see some sketchy or homeless people, but not many and if you keep your wits and be careful, you will be totally ok! Also i did not encounter any scams myself.

üá∏üáÆOVERALL - Slovenia is a small country ( only 2 millions ) yet it is such a beautiful one, it really has something from everything. Beautiful nature, mountains where you can hike and ski, sea where you can swim and go on a beach, rivers where you can canoe, walkable beautiful cities, mix of foods, good beer ( union was my fav hah ), great athletes ( Doncic, Oblak, Kopitar ) and kind people that can speak perfect english!!! (It is really like a second language there, so no worries if you dont know Slovenian at all ) 
Wish i could stay longer, but thats for the next time! 

So, till the next time, nasvidenje Slovenija!ü´∂üá∏üáÆ

Sitting on the roof of my old run down house, looking at the endless sea of stars in the black sky, thinking of my life, what my purpose is in life. I have no family, no friends, hell even pets. I have no one, nothing, nothing to lose, nothing to hope for. I'm simply surviving not living, I'm breathing but I feel dead. If only feelings had an off-switch. If only I can block out the hurtful words, the thoughts, the feelings. I try to tell myself that its not true, all the words,all the pain, that its a chapter and it will pass. But I guess that's a lie, I have been lying to myself. This chapter is not passing, all my life I have been in the same chapter, over and over again, my life is a repeating record, everyday is the same.  
But, I learned to block it out, to numb the pain away. Now, now numbness is all I ever feel. It helps with the words, thoughts, feelings and everything. I learned something when I was 9 years old. I would always cry when my parents would start hitting me, but I realized¬† something, that if I cry or mope around nothing would change, nothing. The kicking, punching, slapping, whipping and degrading wouldn't stop nor will it ever stop. They love when I cry, when I beg, but nothing ever works it comes in an ear and out the other, I haven't cried since I was 10 years old . Crying won't solve my problems, it wont do anything. So I just stopped, I bottle everything up.  I don't burden anyone with my problems or what goes on at home. I know they wont do anything, they will pity me, and if their is one thing I hate most in life that its pity. I don't want people to pity me, I don't need anything from anyone. There is God, God gives me faith, hope, love, everything. I know he will help me. He kept me going till now for a reason. I always wanted one thing as a little little girl . I wanted them to love me. I wanted them protect me and care for me. I wanted her help me with my hair, clothes or simply advice me in life. I wanted him to call me his little princess, to chase away boys, to protect me from bullies. But we don't get everything we want. Because it turned out they became my biggest bullies, I needed protection from them. They became the monsters from under the bed that you need protection from. They ruined me. He ruined me, she ruined me. Both of them broke me, shatterd me, broke me into a million pieces that can't be put together. I always wondered what I did wrong, what I did for them to hate me, to harm me, to despise me that much. But I always came up with nothing. I was a kid who could barely stand, so I never came up with an answer. Its currently 4:00 in the morning and I need to go make my stepfather breakfast and clean the house or else I will get my daily dosage of love (note the sarcasm). With that thought in mind I got up and streched my sore muscles, Obviously that was a mistake as I bent over in pain. Yesterday I came 10mins late from work and he whipped my back and dislocated my knee. I don't even know how I'm walking right now but I guess you could say I'm used to it, the pain. I walked to my room which is basiclly the attic. My room consists of a really thin mattress, a thin blanket, no pillow, and a chair in the corner of the room where I keep my stuff. I went to the broken mirror in the bathroom and lifted my shirt just over my ribs. My stomach has burn marks, open flesh, and bruises. My stomach is a mixture of black, blue, purple, yellow, and green. One thing I hate when looking at my stomach is the word my mom (if you can even call her that) carved there. The¬† word¬† ""whore"" is carved in the middle of my stomach.¬† She carved it with a small pocket knife when I came late from school for doing a project with a boy. I don't even know how she found out. I don't dwell on the thought anymore and start dressing my wounds and sanitizing the cuts with rubbing alcohol and white, big antiseptic bandages. After that I put on my clothes. I make sure to cover the bruises on my face and hands with foundation. Don't want anybody knowing.  
  
After I finished¬† stood and looked at myself in the mirror. My green-blue eyes hold no life, they are dull, lifeless, no shine in them whatsoever. They used to be so bright, full of life and happiness but now they are dead, nothing in them, they look so empty . My face is too thin and pale from the little food and dehydration, My clothes are too big and baggy because i'm too thin. Overall I'm not the most appealing to look at.  
  
When I finish I make my way downstairs to start on breakfast. I make my way to the kitchen and open the fridge and take the ingredients out. I make four¬† pieces of toasted toast, two with fried eggs and the other two with strawberry jam with half an avocado on the side. I put the plate on the table and open the fridge to take out a beer. The second I put the bottle down I hear loud booming footsteps alerting me he's coming.  
  


**Chapter 2**

I stand in the corner in the kitchen and keep my head down . Its one of rules I have to follow or else I get punished.  
  
He makes his way inside and sits on the stool and starts eating. Next thing I know a fist is being thrown in my face. He punches me in the face and I feel the familiar taste of metal in my mouth. He busted my lip when it just healed. Another punch is thrown and he says ""WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS SHIT YOU FUCKING WHORE???""  
  
""T-toast s-sir."" I stutter looking at the floor,  
  
another rule is that I call him sir and never make eye contact, he considers it disrespectful.  
  
It looks like he didn't like that answer as he threw me on the floor and started kicking my stomach.  
  
This went one for 1hour and when he finally had finished I could barely keep my eyes open.  
  
""That's what you get you filthy bitch."" He spat,  
  
I saw him through blurry vision pick up his car keys and leave slamming the door on his way.  
  
Slowly I stand up with the support of the wall and make my way to my room. I open the door and go inside, I reapply my foundation to cover the new bruises. I then eat small granola bar from the kitchen and take two painkillers for my ribs because he broke three I think.  
  
I then make my way outside to leave for work. I close the door and lock it behind me. I work as a waitress in this really cute popular cafe that's 30 mins away. I have been working there for 2years and the owners are really sweet and treat me as their own.  
  
Once I reach the cafe I open the door and the smell of freshly baked goods and coffee fills my nose. I bid Nancy and David the owners good morning and move to put my stuff away. I hear the bell above the door jingle indicating someone came. I put my apron and take my small notebook and pen and head√Ç¬† outside to start working. Let the day begin.  
  
Rebecca'S POV  
  
Its now been a couple hours and I'm so tired. My legs feel like they're about to give out any second. I finish the last table and go lean on the counter. I sigh and close my eyes for minute. Then Nancy comes up to me,  
  
""Darling you look tired, why don't you get your stuff and go home and rest?"" She suggested with a soft smile.  
  
""But Nancy their is still a couple people left. "" I said, trying to convince her to let me stay, but she wasn't having it.  
  
""Its okay hun I'll take care of it and anyways your shift ended hours ago, you always stay overtime, you need rest my sweet girl."" She said.  
  
""Are you sure? √Ç¬† You know I don't mind staying I love working here."" I asked to make sure.  
  
""Yes honey its okay now go get your stuff, its getting late I don't you walking late at night."" She replied. I nodded my head and went to get my bag and put my work stuff away. I said goodnight to Nancy and David and started my way to hell.  
  
As I was walking, I had a feeling like something happened. I don't know what it is but I had a feeling like something big is going to happen and soon. Too lost in my thoughts I didn't notice the bright blue and red lights and the police cars outside my home. I felt my heart start beating faster with each second.  
  
Why is the police here? Oh god what if Boris did something and they are going to take me instead? With all those thoughts I didn't notice a police officer walking towards me.  
  
""Excuse me, Are you Rebecca Anderson?"" Asked the officer.  
  
""Yes sir, is everything okay?"" I asked, concern clear in my voice.  
  
""I'm sorry, honey but your stepfather had an overdose and sadly he didn't make it."" He said, pity in his eyes and voice.  
  
I felt my heart stop. Boris is dead. He's finally dead. He can't hurt me anymore. I'm free from his claws. I never thought that he would die before me, I always thought that maybe he would go too far someday and kill me for good. My dream has come true.  
  
But then suddenly, a thought came to mind. Where will I go? I don't have a father, my mother always told me that when he found out she's pregnant he told her that he didn't want me and left. I have no aunts, uncles, grandparents that I know about.  
  
I have heard about the foster system and I don't wanna go from one bad house to another.  
  
""But where will I go? I don't have anyone that can take me in."" I said, fear gripping my heart and chest.  
  
""We will take you to the station to get a blood sample and see if you have any relatives that would like to take you in. If not then you will be placed in an orphanage or the foster system. For now why don't you go pack your stuff and then we will go ok?"" He suggested, sympathy clear in his voice.  
  
I nodded and went to the house to get my stuff. I didn't have a lot of stuff so it didn't take me long to pack them up. I had two shirts, two sweatshirts, one pair of sweatpants, one pair of leggings and a pair of underwear and a bra. I put them in my backpack and took out the money I have been saving all my life. I counted them and they turned out to be 1,500 dollars.  
  
I put them in my bag and looked at the room one last time. The thought of leaving sounds so surreal, It feels too good to be true.  
  


**Chapter 3**

I looked at the room one last time and went downstairs. When I reached down I went to the officer that I talked with before and told him I was ready. We got inside the car and started driving towards the station. Once we reached we parked and went inside. He told me to sit down and wait for him to come back.  
  
Once he came back he took my blood and told me the results will be back in an hour. It was 8:30 by now and I was exhausted. So I closed my eyes and I felt myself drift off.  
  
ONE HOUR LATER  
  
I felt someone shaking me from my shoulder and I immediately shot up thinking it was Boris. But once I saw the officer I relaxed. But he had a wide grin on his face which confused me. But what he said next confused me even more.  
  
""Well I have some good news for you, we found someone that would love to take you in."" He said with a wide smile.  
  
"" Who?"" I asked curiously.  
  
""Your father and older brothers."" He replied.  
  
I stood there frozen. I couldn't hear anything else he was saying. 'Father', that word kept repeating in my head over and over again. Why would he want me now? Why? He could have saved me years of pain and anguish and now he wants me? I couldn't believe this. My ears kept ringing, my heart kept beating out of my chest.  
  
I didn't notice the officer calling my name until he started shaking my shoulder. I flinched and stepped away from him with wide eyes and mouth hanging open.  
  
""F-father?"" I whispered, still in shock about what I was just told.  
  
""Yes father, isn't that great? Well how about you rest for a while, it'll be a couple hours till he arrives since he's coming from New York."" He explained.  
  
I nodded, I couldn't form any words, nothing could come out of my mouth. Its like my tongue was tied,  
  
'Father' I have a father and he said I have brothers.  
  
How many brothers do I have? Will they like me? What if they hate me? What if they never wanted a sister? Oh god what if they hurt me? I could barely keep up with Boris and now a father and brothers. I couldn't think anymore as I could feel a headache starting. I rubbed my temples and took two painkillers.  
  
My body hurts so much and with this new information. I rested my head against the wall and thought about something, will this be my new start with my new family or will it be my new hell? With that I drifted off.  
  
Arthur'S POV  
  
I'm sitting in my office signing papers for the company and looking at a few designs for my next opening club.√Ç¬† Sighing and taking a small sip of the rich alcoholic flavor I lean my head back on my leather brown chair trying to ease the headache that's forming.  
  
I suddenly get a call from an unknown number. I usually never answer but my gut was telling me to and my gut is always right. So I picked up the phone and answered.  
  
""Hello""I said coldly.  
  
""I-is t-this Mr Arthur Jackson?"" The person on the other line stuttered. Since I'm in the mafia I'm always cold and rude except with my family.  
  
""Yes, now who are you and what do you want?"" He's wasting my time I need to finish work so I can be on time for dinner with my sons.  
  
""Sir this is Texas Police Station we have your daughter here, her DNA matched with yours and she doesn't have a guardian, her stepfather just died. Would you like to take her in? If not she will be placed in an orphanage."" The officer said making my hand freeze midair from where I was signing.  
  
What the fuck is he talking about? I don't have a daughter, I mean, I have always wanted a daughter but me and my ex-wife didn't have one. And I never slept with another woman.  
  
""Listen you have the wrong number I don't have a daughter."" I answered rudely.  
  
I was starting to get annoyed they can't even dial a number correctly.  
  
""Sir your ex- wifes name was Margaret Michael right?""Asked the officer.  
  
What does that bitch have to do with anything? She could be dead for I care.""Yes why ?"" I asked getting really confused.""And she left you and your sons and ran away right?"" By now I was really starting to get mad. What the fuck does he think this is?A guessing game?  
  
""Yes now spit it out I'm fucking busy ""  
  
""Sir your wife changed her name and she was pregnant when she ran away."" He replied.  
  
I sat their frozen. No this can' be possible, she wouldn't just take my child away from me, this is impossible. Fuck I can't even think clearly. I must have been quite for too long because the officer spoke again.  
  
""Sir are you still there ?""I cleared my throat and replied ""Yes I am can you send a photo of her and what's her name?"" I spoke calmly after taking a few deep breaths.""Yes sir I will send a photo and her name is Rebecca Alessandra Anderson."" Said the officer.  
  
""So would you like to take her in? "" Asked the officer.  
  
""Yes I will take her in I will be there in a few hours since i'm coming from New York. "" I replied, feeling my throat clog up.  
  
""Ok sir I will get the papers ready for when you come."" I hung up and put my phone on the table.  
  


**Chapter 4**

I couldn't believe this, a daughter, my daughter, I have a daughter. FUCK,that bitch, how could she? How could she keep my daughter away from me, my principessa, my babygirl. I missed 17years of her life from that bitch. I could never forgive myself. I felt something wet on my cheek. I raised my hand and wiped my cheek, I didn't even realize I was crying. I haven't cried in 30 years. I threw my phone across the room in frustration and watched it as it smashed in a thousand pieces. But that wasn't enough  
  
I called my pilot from my other phone after hanging up with the officer.  
  
"" Get the jet ready we're going to Texas."" I said as soon as he answered. ""Yes sir."" After that I couldn't control my anger anymore.  
  
I sent a message to my 2nd oldest ""Get a duffle bag ready we're going to Texas."" Their was an instant reply ""Yes dad."" good.I still need to take my anger out on something. I threw my glass coffee table across the room and watched as it broke in a million pieces. I kept throwing everything in my office. I didn't keep a single thing. At the end my office was trashed with glass everywhere and papers on the floor.  
  
I took a deep breath and thought of how I'm going to tell my sons. I know one thing and that they're going to be happy. All of my sons wanted a baby sister ever since they were young. And now that they have a baby sister they're going to be over the moon.  
  
I took a long deep breath and pressed the speaker that is connected in the whole house so no matter where they are they can still here ""FAMILY MEETING NOW DON'T BE FUCKING LATE.""  
  
Let's see how it goes.  
  
While I was walking down the stairs, I felt my phone vibrate in my black trousers. I paused my steps and unlocked my phone and opened the e-mail sent from the officer. Once I opened it and saw the picture I stood there frozen in my spot. There was a beautiful girl that looked to be in her teenage years. She had blue- greenish eyes that looked absolutely fetching. Her light brunette hair looked so soft and silky and they were a little past her shoulders. Her face had had nothing on it, not even an acne scar. Her eyebrows were arched and she had a cute button nose.  
  
In that moment all my doubts vanished. I now know that this girl is absolutely my daughter. She looks just Constant. Heck they could be twins if not for the obvious age difference. Though, as I looked at the picture more closely I noticed that she looks a bit too skinny and pale.  
  
I immediately started thinking the worst. Was she not fed properly? Didn't they have enough money to buy food? Is she sick? Does she have small appetite? Was she being starved? I took a deep breath to calm my racing heart and continued walking down the stairs and passed the kitchen until I reached the living room where I could hear my sons bickering and yelling.  
  
I took a breath and opened the living room doors, immediately all the yelling and shouting stopped as soon I stepped in the room. You see, the very first thing I taught my sons is respect. Respect is very important in general but more important in the underworld. People need to respect you in order for you to be powerful and strong. Although my sons and I are extremely close they make sure to never disrespect me or their elders, their is always boundaries. But if a person hurts their family, then it doesn't matter if they are old or young.  
  
Family should always come first no matter what and I made sure to engrave that into their minds 'prima la familia.' Is our motto and we will always live by it till we take our last breaths.  
  
I enter the living room and look around to make sure that all my sons are here. And sure enough, they are all here. Everyone has confused faces on expect Constant and Eamonn who are looking at me emotionlessly but I could see the curiosity swimming in their eyes.  
  
""What do you wanna talk about dad?"" Grumbled Kenny, who looked like he just woke up from a very good nap.  
  
""I got a very intriguing call today. "" I started, but got cut off by Eamonn ""What call?"" I shot him a glare and saw him shiver and he muttered a small 'sorry.' I was too happy to care about being mad at him right now.  
  
""Don't interrupt me boy.""I said and he averted his eyes away from me in shame.  
  
""What was the call about dad?"" Asked Geraint calmly and respectfully.  
  
""Well boys I got a call from Texas police station and he informed me that Margaret died 3 years ago.""√Ç¬† I Informed calmly and waited for them to absorb the new information.I looked at my sons and saw that they had disgusted looks on their faces. The boys never really liked their mother. She never treated them well and never took of them and their necessities.  
  
""That witch was never and will never be our mother."" Spat Enoch.  
  
And a chorus of ' yeses' and nods of approval were thrown his way.  
  
""What does that have to do with us dad ?""Asked Hawke.  
  
""It turns out when she ran away she got remarried, and he died a couple hours ago from an overdose "" I said.  
  
Once I got nods to continue I continued ""And I need to go to the station because there's a special someone waiting for me."" Ismiled wildly at them.  
  
All of them looked at me weirdly because I rarely smile. Maybe a sadistic smile but that doesn't count.  
  
""Who is the special someone?"" Asked Kent.  
  


**Chapter 5**

""My daughter"" I smiled wildly as I thought of my little princess and how she's going to be in my arms soon.  
  
The mafia princess is coming home.  
  
My thoughts of my babygirl were soon cut off by all of them asking, more like yelling ""WHAT?!!!"" Shouted all of them.  
  
""Let me explain "" they nodded and I soon continued, ""Turns out when Margaret ran away she was pregnant and she didn't tell me and when I tried finding her, looks like she changed her name and ran away so I could't find her, trust me when I got that call I was as shocked as you, and when the officer told me she matched my DNA I was so happy, I always wanted a daughter and you guys always wanted a little sister, so that's it.""  
  
I finished and I looked at them all. I saw different emotions, Constant looked emotionless but I could still see the happiness and contentment in his eyes, Geraint, Frankie, and Hawke all had small smiles on their faces and tears of joy in their eyes. Eamonn looked mad, which I couldn't understand why , Eamonn has anger issues and could barely control it sometimes.  
  
I made a mental note to ask him why he's mad  
  
later. Enoch was jumping around cheering and hugging his brothers. Kenny and Kent were already making plans of what they can do, where they can go, and more stuff. And lastly, my youngest son, Isaac, he was sitting on the couch and had a small smile resting on his face. When he thought no one was looking, I saw him take off his glasses and wipe them from tears that dropped on them. He, then proceeded to wipe the tears in his eyes.  
  
""WE FINALLY HAVE A BABY SISTER !!!!!"" Yelled Enoch making us all laugh ""YESSSSS FINALLY WER'RE NOT THE YOUNGEST ANYMORE!!!""  
  
Yelled Kenny and Kent making us chuckle softly at their silly antics.  
  
""Technically you're not the youngest, Lester is, aren't you baby bro?"" Smiled Frankie ruffling Isaac's brunette hair.  
  
Lester only huffed in amusement and fixed his hair back to how it was.  
  
""Wait do you have a picture of her? We wanna see her ""Asked Hawke, all the others nodded in agreement.  
  
I nodded my head and fished out my phone out of my pocket and looked up my babygirl's cute face. I motioned for them to come closer, and I gave Constant my phone and immediately the all of them surrounded him to take a look.  
  
All I heard were gasps in the big modern living room. All of them were staring the phone intensely  
  
And a few sniffs were heard indicating some of them are crying.  
  
""She's so pretty. "" Mumbled Geraint.  
  
""She's soooo cute Ahhhh!!!"" Gushed Enoch.  
  
""She's so adorable"" Smiled softly Frankie as he looked at his sister's photo.  
  
""She's so precious."" Whispered Hawke, Kenny and Kent nodded their heads, agreeing.  
  
Eamonn just stood there frozen looking at the photo in amazement.  
  
""She looks just like Constant"" Whispered Lester.  
  
Everyone gasped and looked at him with wide eyes and mouthes open. Lester rarely talks, he only talks with his twins, he's just quite, he likes to observe more. So we were surprised when he spoke now. He glared at them and they all looked away from him.  
  
Constant still hasn't looked away from the phone yet. Its like he couldn't believe what he was seeing. He then spoke in the most serious and coldest voice, ""No boy will ever come near my baby sister.""  
  
Getting a 'Fuck yeah' from the rest of his brothers as their eyes filled with determination - a sort of promise that no one will ever think about breaking their baby sister's heart or think about hurting her.  
  
I had messaged Geraint earlier to pack a small bag. So, when I got a message from the pilot telling me that the plane was ready. I told them that its time to go. Kent started throwing a fit about how he wanted to go get his sister himself but one look from Constant was enough to make him quite as he started muttering about how we were being 'unfair and mean' I just shook my head at him softly. That boy never fails to amaze me with his goofiness and energy.  
  
I looked at Constant and nodded at him, me telling him to take care of younger brothers till I come back and him nodding at me back at me and silently telling me to bring his baby sister home.  
  
I looked at Geraint and told him that we need to leave he nodded and made his way to the waiting car outside. I looked around one last time and left making my to the car. I got in and soon we were on our way to the airport.  
  
We reached 20 mins later and went on the plane. We buckled up and soon enough we were in the air and on our way to my princess. With that thought in mind I drifted off with my daughter on my mind.  
  
Arthur'S POV  
  
We're now outside the police station and now that we're here it feels more real than before.The fact that I have a daughter becomes more real and I couldn't help but feel nervous.  
  
What if she doesn't like me? What if she tells me she doesn't want to be with us? I couldn't help but the nervousness that settled in me. I took a deep breath and looked at the building that has my daughter and the fact that shes waiting for me to come and take her home. I looked at Geraint one last time and nodded at him, He nodded back, and with that we went inside.  
  


**Chapter 6**

We took powerful strides inside. We had our blank faces on and immediately the once noisy station was now dead silent. You could hear a pin drop from how silent it is. We were greeted by a young officer who looked to be in his early twenties. Once he looked at us, recognition flashed through his eyes and his breathing quickened. Its not everyday you have a mafia don in a police station.Then, He led us to small office that seemed more small with me and Geraint in it due to our muscular and extremely builds. He led us to another young officer that explained the details and papers so that I can take Rebecca's guardianship.  
  
I signed all necessary papers, and I now have all guardianship over my daughter. Once everything was finalized he told me that Rebecca's sleeping in the other room and then proceeded to go and wake her up. He then came back with Rebecca behind him and it looks like she didn't notice us it. She was staring at the floor and it looks like she was deep in thought with how she has a small cute frown on her face and a small pout on her lips, which might I add, looks absolutely adorable.  
  
The officer then called her name and that we've arrived, she looked up and immediately her blue-green eyes made contact with Geraint's blue ones. I watched as he looked at her softly and how he had tears in his eyes. I looked at my princepissa and went towards her.  
  
Rebecca'S POV  
  
My father is here. He's really here, I'm so nervous. What if he doesn't like? What if he hurts me like they did? What if he sends me to another orphanage once we reach New York? My thoughts were soon cut off by a pair of strong muscly arms wrapping around me and my nostrils were filled by a manly cologne that smells and screams rich.  
  
Once I came back to my senses and realized I was trapped, I felt my body tense and I stood there frozen. But a couple seconds later my body relaxed and I melted into that persons embrace. I don't know why but I felt safe in that persons arms, like nothing√Ç¬† in the world will hurt me. I have never felt like this before. I wrapped my skinny and bony arms around the man and my body relaxed.√Ç¬† A few minutes later we both let go, I looked up to see who that unknown man was.  
  
I saw a tall man that looked old and young at the same time . He looked like he's 5o years old. He had a light dark stubble, he had brunette hair that looked exactly like mine, It was gelled back and not a hair was out of place, his eyebrows were plucked and arched perfectly, the kind were that it made women envy their eyebrows. He had small wrinkles around his eyes that you would't notice unless you were looking really closely. His jawline looked sharp and defined. And he was extremely muscular and the Armani suit looked like it would tear any second at any sudden movements. And he's tall, my guess is that he's 6'8. He could crush me with his pinky. I would have to look up at him and crane my neck up. Ughhh he looks like he could eat me with my 5'2 height. He then spoke,  
  
""Hi principessa I'm your father, Arthur Jackson.""  
  
He spoke softly as if he would speak any louder I would break.  
  
""Hi its nice to meet you."" I spoke smiling shyly but never making eye contact with him, just looking at the collar of his Armani shirt. I don't wanna make him mad when I don't know his intentions yet.He seems confused as to why I'm not looking him in the eye but chooses not to comment on it which makes me sigh a sigh of relief. He then spoke again ""It's nice to meet you too princess, I'm sorry I didn't know about you earlier."" He said softly. But what does he mean he didn't know about me? I didn't have time to linger on the thought because he spoke again.""I want to introduce you to someone princess,"" He then gestured to the other man that looks like him and seems to be 6'6 in height ""Princess this is your second oldest brother, introduce your self son."" He said, nodding his head.  
  
""Hi bambina, I'm Geraint its so good to finally meet you."" spoke Geraint softly and then he brought his arms out. Out of instinct I flinched lightly which didn't look like it went unnoticed by them but thankfully they didn't comment on it. He then proceeded to hug me and I immediately responded to the hug. I felt so safe in their arms, like nothing could hurt me.  
  
I felt something wet on my shoulder I looked and saw Geraint crying, I pulled away and brought his face closer to me. I wiped his tears with the pads of my thumbs,he then brought his hands and put√Ç¬† them on top of mine and kissed the palms of my hands. I then whispered softly ""Why are you crying ?"" He wrapped his arms around my waist and brought me in another hug. I bit my lip to stop myself from screaming in pain. He kept hugging me tightly and buried his face in my neck. He then whispered ""I'm so happy to have you in my life sorella."" I was happy that someone would actually care for me. Maybe I can have a new start. I understood what he meant because i'm fluent in a lot of languages.  
  


**Chapter 7**

After couple of minutes he let go and wiped his tears. Then my 'father' asked ""Are you ready to go sweetheart?"" I replied ""Yes I am."" but then Geraint asked, ""Where's your stuff bambina?"" I pointed to my backpack and said ""This is all i have."" I whispered looking at the floor. I saw Arthur and Geraint sharing a look. Its like they're communicating through their eyes. Then Arthur finally said, ""Its okay darling, lets get going now."" He told me with a small smile on his face and I couldn't help but give him one back.  
  
We made our way out of the police station and into beautiful car. I stood there gawking at the metal of hunk. ""You like it?"" Asked Geraint with a soft chuckle. ""Are you kidding me?! I love cars!!"" I replied happily. Then Arthur said, ""Looks like we have another Eamonn."" he said with a small laugh.  
  
Wait who's Eamonn? They both looked at my confused face and then Arthur told me, ""Don't worry you will meet him later."" I just nodded my head and soon enough we were on our way to the airport.  
  
Instead of driving in the normal route Geraint went towards the private planes one. I sat there confused until we reached a matte black plane. Geraint stopped and came and opened my door. I thanked him shyly and he just gave me a small smile. I then turned to Arthur and asked him, ""Why are we here aren't we supposed to go that way?"" I questioned him and pointed to the normal route.  
  
He laughed softly and said, ""No baby we have a private plane."" I stood there looking like a fish out of water opening and closing my mouth trying to say something. He come and raised his hand and I out of instinct flinched. His hand stopped midway and he looked at me in concern and confusion. I gave him a tight lipped smile and he gave a soft one back.  
  
""Come on guys lets get going."" Said Geraint. Thank god he came and√Ç¬† saved the tense silence. I noticed there were a lot of guards but I kept my mouth shut. We soon boarded√Ç¬† the plane and were on our way to New York.  
  
I hope this is a fresh start for me. Because if it isn't, I don't know what I'll do and what will happen.  
  
Rebecca'S POV  
  
Once we were in the air, I looked around and everything looked expensive. From the floor, to the seats, to the ceiling, everything screamed 'rich' and I couldn't help but gawk at everything. Everything was so shiny I was afraid to touch anything.  
  
""Do you like it princess?"" Asked Arthur.  
  
""Yeah it's really pretty."" I said. I looked outside the window and watched the white fluffy clouds. I started thinking of how my life changed so fast. I must have been too lost in my thoughts because I felt someone put their hand on top of mine. I immediately pulled away and looked up and saw Arthur and Geraint looking at me in shock, confusion and concern. ""What was that princess?"" asked Arthur. I looked at Geraint and saw he was waiting for me to answer.  
  
I never liked physical contact especially when its not initiated by me. That basically happens when you were getting beaten everyday by your mom and stepdad. I can never be able to tell them what happened to me. They won't want me anymore and they will throw out. I mean, who wants a damaged and abused girl as a daughter and sister? Once they know they will be disgusted and hate me and then they will throw me into an orphanage.  
  
I flinched when a hand was being waved in front of my face. I looked wide-eyed at the person who was waving the hand and saw that it was Geraint. ""Are you okay baby?"" He asked in a tone that sounded like .... worry? But why would he be worried? He just met me like .... an hour ago. But when I looked into his eyes trying to detect that his tone of worry was a lie, I couldn't see anything but honesty and panic.  
  
""Yeah I am I just don't like physical contact."" I muttered hoping they would believe me. It didn't look like they did but they didn't say anything which I'm glad for.  
  
He leaned forward and grabbed my soft, small hand in his big and rough one and gave it a small reassuring squeeze. ""You must be confused, you can ask us anything you want okay?"" He said softly like he didn't want to scare me.  
  
""So .... umm did you eat lots of vegetables when you were a kid?"" I asked but almost immediately my eyes went wide about what I said. I looked at both of them and saw that both of were trying to hold their laughter in. It didn't last long as both of them burst out laughing, clutching their stomachs as tears fell from their eyes. I just pouted at them and waited for them to be finished with their laughing session.  
  
After they calmed down, Geraint said, ""Oh My God I haven't had such a good laugh in such a long time.""√Ç¬† he laughed again ""But, to answer your question, I did eat a lot of vegetables, dad even would force us to or he'd take our toys.""  
  
I sighed sadly for my poor self and short height and my malnourished body.

My first car was a Civic, but I only had that one for about a year until I was gifted my favorite car. The emotional attachment I have to this car is deep. I named her bean and she was my ride or die. I got into a fender with her recently but after much thought I figured it‚Äôs time to let her go. She‚Äôs not as peppy as she used to be, and at this point she‚Äôs at a stage where I just can‚Äôt keep up with her, and I‚Äôd rather upgrade now vs thousands later, when a new car all together is logically the best option. 

I got a 2015 Kona coffee brown CRV, and I feel like I let her down. She was my everything, but I‚Äôm glad I still have a part of her to keep with me (I kept her license plates). It‚Äôs been a tough transition since it all happened so quickly. I bought my new car about two days after the accident because the circumstances lined up way too well, and I couldn‚Äôt pass up the opportunity. That being said I‚Äôm very happy with my new car, I mean you can‚Äôt go wrong with a CRV!

I love you beanie girl. You‚Äôve made my twenties so sweet. You can‚Äôt and will NEVER be replaced.

1lgq8ru,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1lgq8ru/just_started_intermittent_fasting_this_week_didnt/,"Just started intermittent fasting this week, didn‚Äôt see much of a change, yet.","I‚Äôm 24 Female I weigh 175-176 pounds currently, and 5‚Äô0, with those stats my BMI is about 34.27 which puts me in class 1 obesity category. My friend put me on intermittent fasting by sharing-a podcast, Delay don‚Äôt deny by Gin Stephan and a book, the obesity code. The podcast is based on the book. I listened to the podcast because it was easier to do and understand since its in simple language.

My method right now: I‚Äôm attempting the 8 hour eating window followed by 16 hour fasting with only water. I haven‚Äôt been trying to follow a strict diet as of now, I‚Äôm just eating whatever I can make or get, I‚Äôm still working on meal planning. For me it is a bit hard because I get really hungry when I‚Äôm fasting but try to push through. However, it gets really discouraging when I step on the scale and I don‚Äôt see any numbers going down. I‚Äôm trying to avoid the scale but I can‚Äôt help myself. I‚Äôm in a routine where I measure my weight in the morning and record it on my smart scale app.

Because I get confused and overwhelmed with the hunger I tend to make not the best decisions when it comes to eating. Like two days ago I couldn‚Äôt sleep all night and my stomach was like burning/growling from the hunger and I made quite a few bowel movements during the night too, morning arrives and finally i feel sleepy (my circadian rhythm is messed up). Then I sleep and I end up waking up at 2 pm. I broke my fast with a cup of coffee. Then I decide to go get groceries and end up getting a slice of cheese pizza, vegan chocolate cupcakes, a subway cookie, I go home and I‚Äôm still not satiated and I make some pasta with cheese on it. That was my last meal; which was around eight. Then I started fasting again.

Today, I did the same thing, but I broke my fast at 12:39 pm with a coffee. Today I had to go to a dinner, and then ended up eating more than usual as well as having a sugar binge(three cupcakesüò≠üò≠üò≠, I‚Äôm so baddd). so basically I stopped eating around 11:40 pm yesterday and now I plan to break my fast much later in the day today (its 2 am here). 

My issues: 

- My sleep cycle is messing me up, I literally fo not feel sleepy until 9 in the morning. Its really bad, I need to fix it. I think its mostly because I‚Äôm addicted to reddit right now, and I‚Äôm always looking forward to replies on my posts or just see other content.

- Meal planning. I wake up late in the day and I‚Äôm absolutely confused and exhausted about knowing what to eat. I was told to not focus too much on what you eat right now, but focus on getting into the habit/routine of fasting. Which is what I‚Äôm essentially doing, but I‚Äôm not happy about the sugar binges and junk food I‚Äôm including so its making me nervous. From the podcast, I learner that IF is supposed to fix/heal your metabolism from the damage it has endured over the years, but I‚Äôm thinking if I keep making unhealthy food choices, am I losing the potential benefits I can get? Also I am also vegetarian, and don‚Äôt even eat egg so its so much harder considering you need to go low on carbs also sugar. Its like I‚Äôm not left with much options, but I‚Äôm still trying to find the logistics of how to make it work.

- Exercise. I‚Äôve been pretty lazy these days, but when I do exercise I usually do jogging/speed walking on an inclined tredmill and go high intensity then resting pace in intervals, followed by a strength training YT workout, usually follow Kaleigh Cohen Strength YT workouts.

- Lastly the scale, after a long night of tossing and turning and not being able to sleep on time as well as feeling hunger, I hope to see something go down on the scale, but I don‚Äôt. It feels really discouraging and frustrating for me.

1lgq7sg,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1lgq7sg/my_son_is_living_in_an_alternate_reality/,My Son is Living in an Alternate Reality,"Seven months, two weeks, three days, four hours and forty-three minutes ago, my husband Tyler and our dog Deimos died in a six car pileup.

Deimos was a Belgian Malinois with a Purple Heart clipped to his favorite harness. He helped raise our son just as much as we did. He‚Äôd herd him close at Six Flags or out in the garden, always circling back, always watching. He sat next to him in the bath, on the couch during cartoons, at the bus stop every morning like he had somewhere to be too.

He loved our boy like a brother. But Tyler? Tyler was his everything. When our son was at school, Deimos was at Ty‚Äôs feet. Or sprawled in his lap, eyes closed, breathing in sync. He never quite forgave me for stealing the passenger seat. And when Ty had to leave him behind, which didn‚Äôt happen often, Deimos would crawl into bed with me like a sulking teenager. We‚Äôd eat snacks and watch Forensic Files. Sometimes I think he pretended to like that show just for me.

Ty was quiet. Always had been. He was built like a tank, wide shoulders, big hands, scars that looked like they had stories he didn‚Äôt want to tell. Our son was obsessed with them. He used to ask which ones came from monsters. Tyler would just smile, that small half smile he saved for things that mattered.

He didn‚Äôt talk much. But he noticed everything. A shift in my voice, a too long pause, the way I set my coffee cup down a little too hard, he caught it all. Never called me out, just adjusted. Changed the air in the room.

The moment I fell in love with him wasn‚Äôt anything loud. It was one morning the week before we decided to try for a baby.

The coffee machine was sputtering, spitting out steam in weird little bursts that filled the kitchen with the smell of dark roast. Heavy, bitter, familiar. The whole room smelled like tension and heat. I was just standing there, staring at nothing, clutching the edge of the counter like it might stop me from crumbling. I didn‚Äôt want to go to work. I didn‚Äôt want to move.

And then he was there.

He didn‚Äôt say a word. Just stepped up behind me, wrapped his arms around my waist. I could feel his chest rise and fall against my back, slow and solid like a metronome. His shirt was warm and soft, that gray one he always wore when he didn‚Äôt feel like trying, and his hand came to rest on my ribs, thumb brushing once, light as a sigh.

He didn‚Äôt have to say anything. In that quiet, in that stillness, I felt it. That unshakable thing that lived in him. That thing that told me, You‚Äôre not alone. You don‚Äôt have to carry this by yourself. It‚Äôs going to be okay.

He only stopped being my everything when our son was born nine months later.

We called him Bear. When kindergarten rolled around, his mouth couldn‚Äôt quite handle Bj√∂rn, but he got it the next year. First grade.

While his classmates were learning to add apples and subtract oranges, Bj√∂rn was toying with multiplication. Then division. That‚Äôs how it always was. Every year, he pulled a little farther ahead of the curriculum.

By his freshman year of high school, he was sitting in a senior Financial Algebra class like he belonged there. And he did.

But he wasn‚Äôt cold. He wasn‚Äôt antisocial. He wasn‚Äôt one of those genius kids with dead eyes and zero empathy. He wasn‚Äôt killing animals behind the school or ranting about ancient empires or conspiracy theories on Reddit.

As far as anyone could tell, he was just Bj√∂rn. My Bear.

He told Ty he wanted to be a great inventor. The title changed over the years, engineer, then quantum theorist, then particle physicist, but it was always the same dream. He wanted to bring the world something brilliant. Something his.

Ty and I promised we‚Äôd pay for his college, so long as he kept doing our taxes.

It was perfect. My son was growing into a man. Six foot three, one hundred eighty pounds, a jawline that made girls trip over themselves, no matter how much he swore they didn‚Äôt.

And then it was gone.

I was on my way to work. Singing, absently, mouthing the words to Today by The Smashing Pumpkins.

That trance, that soft, safe little morning cracked when a number I didn‚Äôt recognize lit up my screen.

I hesitated before answering.

It‚Äôs a miracle I wasn‚Äôt pulled over. I blew through two red lights. My hands were shaking. My chest felt like it had caved in.

But even that, even speeding, even saying no no no over and over like it could change the ending, it still wasn‚Äôt enough.

The next four months weren‚Äôt real. I daydreamed my life as it unfolded in front of me. I watched from the empty specter eyes of an insomniac. Sentences broke through further and further apart. I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm here for you if you need to talk. Do you need anything?

These repeated questions passed through me, the same as my son.

I embraced the people willing to help the best I could. But my son, my Bear, didn‚Äôt.

I gave him time. I tried to talk to him about it, but he was never ready.

I saw him less and less. He disappeared into Ty‚Äôs garage and his room, stopping only to make himself a plate or move between rooms. His door remained locked. And the garage was a mess before he occupied it. I heard the construction of his steel prison. The sawing iron. The sander. Every toolbox my husband owned. He tore apart his car. And any appliances we had in the house.

The constant noise drowned out my reality.

What bothered me was it was the only noise I ever heard from him.

His sobs shattered me into a million pieces.

His deep agony, his calls for his father and his dog rang in my ears and brought me to tears.

It was tonight that I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I couldn‚Äôt handle my Bear‚Äôs soul being ripped from his body and dissolved by his tears.

I got up. I made us hot chocolate. Something my son and Ty drank at every holiday, every late night car tuning, every rough night, every breakup.

The hallway terrified me. I feared my son resented me or blamed me. I imagined it in my head. Why wouldn‚Äôt you help me? I needed you.

I shook my head. No. It didn‚Äôt matter. My son needed me.

But my thoughts were interrupted when I heard it.

I had ignored it all this time because I believed it was just another project my son created, but as I listened, it persisted.

A thud. Then a hiss. Thud. Hiss. Thud. Hiss.

Along with it, a pulse. Rhythmic and consistent.

And among it, my son‚Äôs sobs were nowhere to be found.

The door was unlocked.

It clicked open, and before me was my son.

He was all around me. Screens displaying Bj√∂rn running in the garden with his father and his dog.

Ty wore a smile I hadn‚Äôt seen since our wedding day. I watched as he ruffled our son‚Äôs hair and Deimos jumped on his back.

Then I came into frame. Tears stained on my cheeks, but my smile was just as wide as Ty‚Äôs.

I was pulled away from the screen by a vomit inducing squelch.

I stepped into the bathroom.

My legs barely moved. My thoughts screamed louder than the silence.

Bj√∂rn was there. But not my son.

His head was shaved. Tubes ran from his mouth and chest like parasitic vines. Clear fluids hung from plastic bags nailed to the curtain rod. His stomach was bloated and pulsing. Machines breathed for him in long, wheezing sighs.

But it was his eyes, or what was left of them, that froze me.

Two silver wells. Hollow and twitching. Something metal slithered in and out, tubing reeling into his skull like worms.

I clutched the doorframe.

On the sink: kitchen knives. Alcohol pads. His hair, shorn in thick black curls. Blood soaked into the towels. The sink pink from where he tried to clean it.

I vomited. I sobbed. I screamed so loud my voice cracked into silence.

And on the screens behind me, our family lived on. Tyler laughing. Deimos panting. My son chasing butterflies that would never land.

He had built himself a world where nothing ever hurt.

And left his body behind to rot.

That was the last day of my life as I knew it.

Since then, I‚Äôve lost my job. My contacts. All of my time, money, and focus has gone into reading the remnants of my son‚Äôs once great mind. Scrawled across notebooks. Whiteboards. Receipts from tech companies I didn‚Äôt even know existed.

I have all the information my son left for me.

And tonight, I‚Äôm going to get him back.

I‚Äôm going to get my son.

My Bear.

I didn‚Äôt marry into this expecting rainbows, but I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be treated like trash either.
So, I (24F) married my husband (27M) two years ago. He‚Äôs amazing. Kind, funny, grounded. I know people say that a lot, but seriously he‚Äôs the kind of guy who makes your coffee before you even get out of bed. He's not the problem.
His mom though? She‚Äôs a whole different story.
At first, I thought she was just shy or reserved. But no. She‚Äôs cold. Sharp. Always watching. Like I‚Äôm some dirty stain on her family photo.
She‚Äôll say things like: ‚ÄúOh‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre not really cooking that, are you?‚Äù or
‚ÄúBack in my day, we didn‚Äôt need to show off with store bought pastries.‚Äù
or the worst one that actually made me cry in the bathroom:
‚ÄúWell, she‚Äôs sweet, but not very‚Ä¶ refined. You know what I mean.‚Äù
And she said that TO MY HUSBAND. WHILE I WAS IN THE ROOM.
He defended me. He told her that was out of line. But she just laughed like it was a joke. A ‚Äúharmless comment.‚Äù
I tried so hard, I swear. I brought her flowers once. She left them in the sink.
I made her her favorite dish (which she mentioned in passing ONCE) she took one bite and said it tasted ‚Äútoo modern.‚Äù

She‚Äôs even commented on how I dress. Said it looks like I‚Äôm ‚Äútrying to be someone I‚Äôm not.‚Äù
I‚Äôm not loud. I‚Äôm not confrontational. I‚Äôm the kind of person who apologizes when I get bumped into.
So I bite my tongue. Every time. And honestly? That‚Äôs eating me alive.
I want to be close to her. She‚Äôs my husband‚Äôs mom. I want to respect her. I want to love her. But how do you love someone who treats you like you‚Äôre never good enough?
It‚Äôs starting to wear me down. I feel like I‚Äôm losing pieces of myself just trying to fit in.
My husband says to ignore her. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôll come around.‚Äù But what if she never does?
What if I‚Äôm just her permanent target?
I know I‚Äôm a good person. I try. I care. I‚Äôm not perfect but I don‚Äôt deserve to be constantly put down. Right?
Still‚Ä¶ I keep telling myself to be patient. That one day she‚Äôll see me for who I am. And maybe, just maybe, she‚Äôll let me in.
But deep down, I‚Äôm starting to wonder‚Ä¶
If I keep letting her treat me like this just to ""keep the peace"" and earn her approval‚Ä¶

We talk it out, and then im asking again because nothings locked down. She said it made her feel bad. Not intentional on my part - annoying and wrong all the same in the sense I did become a broken record because its one of the things I think about since my default is alone or with kiddo. Im NC with all family. I have no partner and no family except for my daughter. Who is lovely and I love her. 


I have an extremely small circle of friends who are in relationships, also have kids and families. People are always asking for their time, but no one is asking for mine. Makes a huge difference. I don't get invited to too much. I don't get visited often without asking and I'm the one to drop in and bring coffee or lunch typically. Vacations, and trips, excursions curated by other people - a whole different world I'm not entirely privy to. I don't know what it feels like to be sought out all the time so you feel you need space. My best friend though, between work and her other established relationships and new ones, her times accounted for and during busy times I don't get to catch her much. Everyone I know are busy. I was having a hard time adjusting. Thus resulting in me messing up.

But now i think I've pushed her away due to a combo of not shutting up on my part, which I take accountability for - and ultimately not realizing she just didn't want to. 

So mentally I got caught up in a loop especially hearing her get to a bunch of cool things. She's not talking to me at the moment on a trip with an aquantince for a bachelorette party. We talk every day so it's certainly cold right now and I'm hoping I didn't do something permanent. She didn't do anything wrong and we communicate. I just think she misunderstands how I feel and/or it's a burden. And frustrating to have to hear about it. I support her peace and getting breaks, fun and space. She works hard. 

Tldr; I'm learning that in a way, found family has to choose and prioritize you and you have to give them the decision to. You can't assign those things without their consent or you run into things like this. Rven if its not intentional, its a lot of pressure. I realize, I crave those connections so much i do not wait for it to be initiated. I don't really know how I was supposed to navigate finding my community just to have to end up feeling alone for other reasons. Not their fault, life is busy, but its a lot to swallow emotionally because I think my heart felt once I was established around better people who actually like me, all those things would open up and stay consistent. Especially when keeping myself flexible and open. I know I sound weak. It will pass. I'm just sad. I was very idealistic in an unhealthy way. I'm paying for it poetically. People gotta want you around and initiate and seek you out too or it will not be balanced. I just wish I knew the rules beforehand. I'm sure things would feel different if I had a foundation and secure relationships my whole life and not starting in my late 20s and 30s.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Predictions: Doosan Bears vs. LG Twins (June 21, 2025)**  
*The LG Twins (-1.5, 1.57 moneyline) are the consensus favorites, but the Doosan Bears (2.45 moneyline) are about to make you question every stat you‚Äôve ever trusted.*

**The Spread:**  
LG‚Äôs -1.5 run line looks daunting, but let‚Äôs be real‚Äîthis is KBO, not the MLB. The Twins‚Äô ‚Äúace‚Äù (read: guy who alphabetically comes after ‚ÄúChoi‚Äù) will either dominate or serve up a home run to a Bears batter named ‚ÄúOh, My Dang.‚Äù DraftKings has the spread at 1.68 for Doosan +1.5, which feels like the sportsbooks are whispering, *‚ÄúTrust the Bears to pull this off.‚Äù*

**Totals:**  
The 7.5-run Over/Under is a knife-edge bet. Fanatics has the Under at 1.83, probably hoping you‚Äôll forget how often KBO pitchers throw‚Ä¶ *exactly 7.5 runs*. If you‚Äôre feeling lucky, take the Over only if you‚Äôre also betting on a rain delay that‚Äôll make the game last until 2026.

**Why the Bears Might Win:**  
Because the LG Twins‚Äô lineup is basically a spreadsheet error waiting to happen. Doosan‚Äôs 2.45 moneyline is basically a cry for help from bettors who think, *‚ÄúSurely this team can‚Äôt be this bad!‚Äù* Spoiler: They are.

**Why the Twins Might Win:**  
They‚Äôre favored for a reason, which is code for ‚Äúthey have better coffee in the clubhouse.‚Äù The -1.5 spread is a nudge, not a challenge.

**Final Verdict:**  
This game is a coin flip that‚Äôs been weighted by a Korean magician. Take the Under if you want to sleep at night. Take the Doosan +1.5 if you enjoy living on the edge.

*No player props were listed in the context, so we‚Äôre all guessing. Good luck, and remember: the only thing more unpredictable than KBO is your Tuesday morning commute.* üé©‚öæ

In a twist that would make a soap opera writer weep (with laughter), Al-Ahly‚Äôs FIFA Club World Cup fate hinges on a combination of math, luck, and whether Inter Miami can finally stop Palmeiras from scoring. Let‚Äôs recap the chaos:

**The Latest Disaster:**  
Al-Ahly‚Äôs 2-0 loss to Palmeiras on June 19 (thanks to goals from Sam Abu Ali and Jose Manuel Lopez) left them bottom of the group with 1 point, two goals behind, and a sinking feeling that their New Jersey vacation might end with an early exit. Meanwhile, Porto‚Äîafter their 2-1 loss to Inter Miami‚Äîalso sits with 1 point, clinging to hope like a sleep-deprived fan holding coffee at 4 AM Cairo time.

**The Math: More Confusing Than a VAR Decision**  
To advance, Al-Ahly needs:

1. A **win** against Porto on June 24 (4 AM Cairo time, because why not make fans suffer through insomnia?).
2. A **draw** between Inter Miami and Palmeiras in the same time slot.

If both happen, Al-Ahly and Porto will tie on points, goal difference, and dignity, but only the top two advance. Since Palmeiras (4 points) and Inter Miami (4 points) already have a head start, our Egyptian heroes and their Portuguese counterparts are left playing ‚Äúmath hopscotch‚Äù in the hopes of sneaking into the knockout stages.

**Group Standings: A Tale of Two Teams**

* **Palmeiras**: 4 points, +2 goal differential (leading like a boss).
* **Inter Miami**: 4 points, +1 goal differential (surprise, surprise).
* **Porto**: 1 point, -1 goal differential (meh).
* **Al-Ahly**: 1 point, -2 goal differential (uh-oh).

**The Verdict:**  
Al-Ahly‚Äôs match against Porto is less of a soccer game and more of a high-stakes gamble. Win, and they might survive if Inter Miami and Palmeiras gift them a draw. Lose, and they‚Äôre packing their bags for a premature flight home. As one source put it: *‚ÄúThe fate of Al-Ahly and Porto is in the hands of Inter Miami and Palmeiras.‚Äù* Translation: Hope for the best, pray for a tie, and maybe whisper to the soccer gods for a miracle.

**Final Thought:**  
If this were a movie, it‚Äôd be titled *‚Äú4 AM in New Jersey: A Tragedy in Four Acts.‚Äù* Good luck, Al-Ahly. You‚Äôll need it‚Äîand maybe a goal from a hat trick of miracles.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Al-Ahly‚Äôs Desperate Gamble: A Night of Hope, a Morning of Coffee (and Regrets)**

In a twist that would make a soap opera writer weep, Al-Ahly‚Äôs FIFA Club World Cup fate has been reduced to a high-stakes poker game of ‚Äúhope Inter Miami trips over their own feet.‚Äù After a 2-0 loss to Palmeiras‚Äîthanks to Sam Abu Ali‚Äôs 49th-minute opener and Jose Manuel Lopez‚Äôs 59th-minute insurance goal‚ÄîAl-Ahly now faces Porto on June 24 at 4:00 AM Cairo time (because nothing says ‚Äúsporting spectacle‚Äù like a 4 AM kick-off in New Jersey).

**The Stats That Keep Fans Up at Night:**

* **Al-Ahly‚Äôs Group D nightmare**: 1 point (0-1-1), -2 goal differential.
* **Porto‚Äôs equally bleak outlook**: 1 point (0-1-1), -1 goal differential.
* **Palmeiras** leads the pack with 4 points (+2), while **Inter Miami** lurks in second with 4 points (+1).

The math? Simple: Al-Ahly and Porto must **win their final match** *and* pray Inter Miami and Palmeiras draw in their concurrent 4:00 AM clash. If that happens, all four teams will have 4 points, but goal differentials will send Al-Ahly and Porto packing like overpriced checked luggage.

**Why This Is the Most Bizarre Night in Soccer History:**

* **Time zone chaos**: A 4:00 AM game in New Jersey for a group stage that‚Äôs more confusing than a TikTok algorithm.
* **Inter Miami‚Äôs earlier 2-1 win over Porto** (yes, *that* Porto) has left the Portuguese side questioning their life choices.
* Al-Ahly‚Äôs fans are now chanting, ‚Äú*We want coffee, not chaos!*‚Äù

**The Verdict:**  
Al-Ahly‚Äôs hopes rest on a script so convoluted, even Netflix would reject it. They‚Äôll need to outscore Porto while simultaneously hoping Inter Miami and Palmeiras engage in a defensive masterclass. If that happens? Consider it a miracle. If not? Blame the scheduling committee‚Äî*and maybe the time zone*.

**Final Odds?**  
Let‚Äôs just say the bookies are offering ‚Äúemotional survival kits‚Äù to Al-Ahly fans. The price: $4.99 (plus tax).

If you‚Äôre new to the Pacific Northwest or planning a trip here, you might already have Mount Rainier, Pike Place Market, or a coffee crawl on your itinerary. But here‚Äôs a little local secret: a **Fishing Charter Seattle** experience might just be the highlight you didn‚Äôt know you needed. Puget Sound, with its incredible mix of scenery, fish species, and salty adventure, is hands-down one of the most underrated fishing destinations in the entire country.

# Not Just a Body of Water‚ÄîIt‚Äôs an Angler's Playground

Puget Sound is a sprawling saltwater estuary that wraps around Seattle and stretches north past Edmonds, WA. It‚Äôs not only rich in marine life, but it also offers stunning surroundings: evergreen-draped cliffs, snow-capped mountains, and a skyline that includes both skyscrapers and bald eagles. The best part? You can be on the water reeling in your first catch within an hour of landing at Sea-Tac Airport.

# Home to Legendary Salmon Runs

You‚Äôve heard of Alaska's salmon, sure. But Puget Sound is home to its own legendary runs. Booking a **Salmon Fishing Charter** in Seattle or Edmonds puts you in prime waters for Chinook, Coho, Pink, and Chum salmon throughout the year. If you're lucky enough to visit during an odd-numbered year, the Pink salmon run is downright electric.

# More Than Just Salmon

While salmon get the headlines, Puget Sound also offers rich bottom fishing for lingcod, halibut, and rockfish. There's even the occasional octopus sighting. For anglers who love variety, the Sound delivers in spades. And yes, that 40-pound halibut you heard about? Totally real.

# Underrated = Uncrowded

Unlike more hyped destinations, Puget Sound fishing charters don‚Äôt come with long waits, oversold boats, or elbow-to-elbow casting. It‚Äôs the sweet spot between wild nature and accessibility. You get that peaceful, authentic fishing vibe while still being close to all the creature comforts of Seattle.

# Great for Newbies and Pros Alike

Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned angler or holding a rod for the first time, the captains at Puget Sound Sports Fishing are there to guide you every step of the way. They supply top-tier gear, local knowledge, and pro tips to make your trip easy, fun, and fish-filled.

# A Perfect Add-On to Any Vacation

Let‚Äôs be honest‚Äîafter a few days of city life or hiking, nothing hits quite like a morning on the water. Add a fishing charter to your Seattle vacation, and suddenly your trip has a highlight story you‚Äôll be telling for years. (And maybe even a salmon dinner you caught yourself!)

# Don‚Äôt Miss Out

Still on the fence? Trust us‚Äîthis is one of those ""why didn‚Äôt I do this sooner?"" experiences. A **Fishing Charter Seattle** outing is your ticket to discovering why locals love this water and why Puget Sound deserves way more national fishing fame.

Book your trip with [Puget Sound Sports Fishing](https://pugetsoundsportsfishing.com/) and experience the wild side of Washington with seasoned guides and epic scenery. But don‚Äôt wait‚Äîspots fill up fast, especially during peak salmon runs. [Reserve your adventure now](https://book.peek.com/s/53bd8eaf-ab69-4edb-b006-1a07b3507541/K1krd) and find out for yourself why Puget Sound is America‚Äôs hidden fishing gem.

Her big swollen belly hiding daddy from view, we go for our picnic.  We ate our lunch and played in the grass and tress, at the courtyard within the palace. When daddy finally came down with uncle Marcus and some strange men. ‚ÄúStay here baby‚Äù mummy says so I keep playing with baby Isaac, while mummy and daddy both talk to the men.  Suddenly I hear mummy scream, and daddy is shouting. I grab baby Isaac and I look up to see a man holding something around mummy's neck, while daddy's shouting. then mummy and daddy both drop to the floor and there‚Äôs a man with a scary smile approaching Isaac and me.  Run Lyla"" daddy shouts in my direction. Daddy never uses my name, so I know this is serious. As I turn, baby Isaac is ripped from my arms. And drops to the floor completely still, I see lots of blood on him. ""Lyla run!"" daddy shouts again. the man keeps coming for me and I feel his hand on my back as I try and run away from his grip, spinning and taking off. I go through the corridors and burst outside the palace doors. All I can see is fighting and fire, the sounds of men, women and children screaming hurts my ears. Covering them I turn right and run into the woods heading south. Daddy takes me on walks all around the grounds, telling me about the land and what is in each direction. So I know the woods are thick on this side with many hiding spots.  A loud growl makes me stop and turn, and a big dog jumps at me ""ahhhhh I wake up hyperventilating ""fk"" I curse under breath, rubbing my eyes. I Rolled out of bed and go to the only thing I know will help calm me, the shower. Boiling water pours over my skin, the steam helping my breathing slow down. Once I'm calm, I'm able to focus on the shower, cleaning my skin and long hair. I know the dream didn't come from me, rather it came from Lilith. She relives that memory, because she feels guilty she wasn't around then, to protect me or our family. I know she will ignore me for a while now, her pride won't let me comfort her. Instead heading to my wardrobe I put on my favourite black leggings, sports bra and jacket. Walking out of my room I slip on my combat boots and head to the common room for breakfast. While going down the stairs I tie my long dark brown hair, into a high pony tail. Strong Coffee, with scrambled eggs and bacon on toast. just the way you like it"" Rose says, placing a plate and cup down at my empty seat. Her short crimson is hair pulled back into a cute little pony and she's wearing one of her many summer dresses. She has beautiful chocolate coloured eyes and dimples in her cheeks, when she smiles. Just what I need Rose thankyou"" I practically pounced into my chair to eat. She just smiles as she watches me swiftly empty my plate. Rose and her mate John were the alpha and Luna here. They then passed down their titles to their son Jackson on his 20th birthday, when he found his mate Samantha 10 years ago. You'd think I would hate wolves after what happened but John and Rose are different. Rose saved my life that night and carried me all the way here. She nursed me back to health and cared for me, I could never repay her for that. Wow, slow down sis"" Jackson says while ruffling my hair and sitting next to me. Jackson is a typical brother he even glares and growls at guys who check me out or flirt.   
Can't be late for training bro"" I say punching him in the shoulder running out laughing. I get to the field first and run laps for a while and some stretches. By the time I'm done everyone's there and pairing up for sparing and as usual no one picks me. it's not because they don't like me, they just don't want to be their a$$es beat by a girl.  As far as wolf's go they're all strong and fast, the higher rankers even more so but, because of what I am, I'm even stronger and faster then them. They think it's because I'm an Alpha's daughter from a nearby pack that was destroyed 20 years ago, not long before my people were. But because Rose rescued me only her and the John know what I am. No one else will ever know, as my people were demonised back then and everyone hated my kind. I care about this pack they took me in after all, I don't want anyone to be scared of me. Oi kid, you going to spar or just stand there with your head in the clouds"" turning I see John looking at me questioningly. He has light brown and grey hair, with bright green eyes. He is a lot taller then me, he stands at 6‚Äô2 while compared to him, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô5. He wasn't happy when rose saved me and brought me here, but she believed children to be innocent victims. I remember hearing them argue over me and John avoided me at all costs. After a while I would sneak to his training sessions, I was so captivated by the way they moved. I would copy them practising on my own under the bleachers. One day he found me and sent me away, but I kept coming day after day. Eventually he would watch me rather then send me away, it wasn‚Äôt long before he started correcting my form. From that day on he let me train on the field, he told Rose, it was because he didn't want me to hurt myself. She never believed him though Rose told me that he is a big softie on the inside, and that they had always wanted a daughter. She also said he used to do the same thing as a pup, and so I had caught his heart. I didn‚Äôt believe her at first, but I often caught him smiling at me when I got something right. Hey old man, you find me someone to spar with, then yea I'll join in"" I say earning myself a c\*cky smile from him. it's too late though, I just signed myself up for a three on one. John called over a sparing pair and all three of them stood around me, in fighting stances. Well at least I'll get a good work out. The soldier behind me rushes me and put his arm around my neck in a choke hold. I grabbed his shoulders and kicked my legs up higher then my head. My downward momentum and pulling strength, sent him over my head, into the other soldier. there was no time to celebrate though John sent a fist to my face that I only just managed to dodge while throwing my leg out under his extended arm knocking him to the ground. now the soldiers were up coming for me. This went on for thirty minutes before both the soldiers yielded. John as expected, was still standing swapping blows, I landed way more then he did. He was a fighter, never giving up, in a real battle he would have been defeated, countless times by now. Instead I bait him with a high punch off centre leaving my side open for a kick, I know he saw it. Halfway through my punch, when he started to duck, I retreated my hand and caught his leg. While kicking the other out from under him, slamming him to the ground hard. I knew he would be winded and instead of getting up he lay there laughing.   
  
""You cheeky s\*it"" he bellowed.   
  
""You are the one who feel for it not me old man"" I commented earning another laugh. I helped him up and he sent me off to spar with another group. later I checked on the newer trainees offering tips and pointers as needed. John said that with me here, his people work harder to get to my level. And that‚Äôs what made us one of the strongest packs around, because our warriors were hard to defeat. When John had business I was the one who taught the training sessions and John was always impressed with their improvement.   
  
I headed to my room to shower yet again before lunch. Putting on black jeans, a fitted long sleeve maroon top and comfortable flats. I left my dark hair down letting it dry naturally into soft waves. lastly my signature long delicate chain wrapped around my waist many times. Only john knows why I wear it and it's significance to me. Around my 16th birthday he went to my old home to try and find a gift for me, that would mean a lot. He found the chain in a wooden box with my name on it, in my fathers old office. It‚Äôs a rare indestructible lightweight metal, not even I could break it.   
  
Walking into the buffet lunch I filled my plate and sat down next to Rose and we ate together. We sat in silence as we watched warriors return from training for food. Everyone is loud and laughing, the atmosphere was happy and comfortable. Then Eddie walked past our table winking at me, making Rose laugh. I just rolled my eyes, Eddie is my brothers gamma. He has always flirted with me since I was fifteen, Jackson never liked it.   
  
Just seeing him makes me dread tomorrow, I have to work with both Eddie and Jackson. As beta Michael is away visiting at a nearby pack that was attacked by vampires last night and won‚Äôt return until the day after. Jackson sent his beta and 9 other warriors to help fight them off, there were over 50. Our warriors are impressive, they were ones I had mostly trained myself. they disposed of the vamps quickly, so I am filling in for him tomorrow. While Rose and Samantha are planning a party for his return, because found his mate while he was there.   
  
Out of the corner of my eye, Eddie is still staring at me. While many of the guys here called me beautiful, for me it was painful to look in a mirror. I'm almost identical to what my mum looked like, although I got my curls and smile from my dad. My eyes are like a liquid royal blue, just like my mom's, but they're a painful reminder of the nickname my father gave me, when I was little.   
  
I spent the rest of the day in the games room with Jackson and his friends. I never really made any, all the girls here are prissy and we just don't click. Eddie was groaning over Michael finding his mate he didn‚Äôt want to be the only bachelor in their friend group. He always said they‚Äôre all pu$$y whipped, but i can tell it comes from jealousy. We joked all night swapping between video games, pool and drinking games.   
  
By the time I got to my room it was passed midnight. Flicking on the light I leaned on the back of my door, I felt woozy looking around my room at the midnight blue walls. I go to my wardrobe and changed into some night clothes. I wondered out to my four poster bed banging my knee on the blanket box at the end.""fk"" I whispered and after staggering a little I crashed into my bed sliding under the covers.   
  


# Fith Attack Surprise

2249¬†WordsAndrew POV   
  
Bang, bang, bang.   
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äù I growled to the person banging on my door so damn early, I was enjoying my dream.   
  
‚ÄúYour highness, another pack is under attack‚Äù he yelled shakily back. Damn it, jumping out of bed I threw on some clothes running out the door.   
  
‚ÄúWhat pack?‚Äù I glared down at the trembling man.   
  
‚ÄúSky moon, sir‚Äù he whispered.   
  
‚ÄúLuke, get your a$$ up and get to my office now‚Äù I mind linked my beta   
  
‚ÄúAlready here, with your mum, dad and gamma troy‚Äù he replied. I ran down the hall barging through my office doors.   
  
‚ÄúWhat do we know?‚Äù I say looking at Luke.   
  
‚ÄúSky moon pack, is just north east of here. We offered to send sent 30 warriors to aid them, but they asked for warriors from the northern star pack. They‚Äôve already lost roughly 15 pack members, and there‚Äôs about 50 vampires. We contacted northern star and they‚Äôve already sent out some of there top warriors.‚Äù he rushes out.   
  
‚ÄúWe have the best warriors here, why would they refuse 30 good men‚Äù I shout slamming my hands on my desk. That‚Äôs the fith pack attacked this month, we can‚Äôt loose anymore packs. Three were wiped out and one lost eighty percent. We had to move the remaining members here, this is getting out of hand.   
  
Frustrated I land backwards in my chair huffing. ‚ÄúWe need to find out why there are so many attacks, they will come here eventually‚Äù dad says. ‚ÄúMaybe they have nothing to do with the vampire kingdom, we should ask for a meeting with the their king. We had a agreement with them 20 years ago, we need to know if they are no longer our allies‚Äù he states, but that would mean meeting with that bloodsucker. I hate those guys, but it might be our only way to figure out what‚Äôs going on.   
  
‚ÄúAlright, dad you‚Äôve got a point. Luke, I want you to update me on the sky moon pack, as soon as we get any updates. And someone go tell Marc I want to see him now‚Äù this situation needs to end now. I look over to see my mother curled into my dad, I could tell she was tired from being woken up at this hour. There was also concern on her face and it mirrored my dads. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry mum, we will figure it out. Go back to bed, and try to sleep for me‚Äù I hated seeing her like that. Her chocolate brown hair was messy from sleep and I could see bags under her light green eyes. While my fathers hair was light brown and stood out at every angle from running his hand through it, in frustration. He also had dark circles around his dark green eyes.   
  
They all filled out of my office and I slumped over the desk frustrated. 20 years ago both the vampire king and our kingdom had an insider come and warn us about an upcoming power war. We all decided to end it before it starts, given that this was a common enemy between our two kingdoms we had agreement made. They leave us alone and we leave them alone and in exchange we fought the danger together. If the vampire king has gone back on this I need to find out why.   
  
‚ÄúCome in‚Äù I say sensing Marc near the door.   
  
‚ÄúWhat can I do for you, your majesty?‚Äù he states blank faced. Something about this guy always rubbed me the wrong way, but he was an asset. He was my fathers adviser and now mine, but he just wasn‚Äôt like the rest of us. I couldn‚Äôt tell where his loyalty was, with us, the vamps or his own well-being.   
  
‚ÄúYou have connections with the vampire king, don‚Äôt you?‚Äù I questioned.   
  
‚ÄúYes, did you need something?‚Äù he said still blank faced, which really irked me. Of course I needed something, I had him wakened at 3 am. Also with all the vampire attacks he should know where this is going, why is he always like this.   
  
‚ÄúYes, arrange a meeting with him for me I need to figure out why these attacks keep happening‚Äù I say obviously frustrated. He nods and leaves my office, I sit here and mull things over for hours. When the sun finally comes up, I realise I need sleep, in preparation for tonight. Marc had come in at some point and told me the Vampire king would meet me, on our mutual boarder to the west, at midnight.   
  
I Leave my office and head for my room. Looking around as I was this place is bare, it makes it look elegant. I always felt it seemed empty and lonely, the only decor was on the walls. All the halls were filled with long tapestry‚Äôs, paintings or designs along the walls. The whole place was white with gold etchings and light marble hallways. The place was devoid of any noise or happiness these days, with the attacks.   
  
My room was similar, empty and open planned. I crashed into bed and passed out immediately, dreaming of a life I may never have. The ideal of my own little family was slipping further and further away.   
  
‚ÄúAlpha, you should come to your office, we have news of sky moon‚Äù Luke said through mind link waking me.   
  
I got out of bed and rushed to my office, glad I had crashed out in my clothes. I ran my hands through my tousled hair, when I sat at my desk. A streaming hot cup of coffee sitting there waiting for me, perfect.   
  
‚ÄúSky moon lost 18 members in total, 40 vampires were killed and 10 escaped‚Äù he said relieved. Any number of men lost is difficult but 18 compared to entire packs that have been lost is relieving news. ‚ÄúThe only thing is they only received 10 warriors from northern star‚Äù he was puzzled, so am I.   
  
‚ÄúSky moon has less members then the destroyed packs, and the number of vamps that attacked them was greater then that of the destroyed packs. It‚Äôs good news they‚Äôve survived but how is it they faired better?‚Äù I said astonished.   
  
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs norther star, I enquired about the warriors and there pack. They were attacked two months ago by over 100 vampires and lost no one. They have even less members then Sky moon. Also do you remember the warrior‚Äôs comp we had last year, northern star came first. Not even me being the kings beta could beat a simple warrior. I thought it was luck, now I‚Äôm thinking different‚Äù mark replied,   
  
‚ÄúI agree it‚Äôs odd, but useful. If these attacks become a war, we need them. Damn they must have some intense trainers, we need to go to that pack‚Äù finally something that could work in our favour, this could prevent a war.   
  
""Yea, they could really help. I'll give them a call, the warriors won't return for a couple days but the trainers should be there. I heard the warriors stayed to help bury their members."" Luke says leaving my office.   
  
all that's left now is to prepare to see the vampire king.   
  
I spent the rest of the day in my office, going over mountains of paperwork. I also had a few calls to make, I gave the sky moon alpha my condolences. I‚Äôm not looking forward to the meeting with the vampire king. On the other hand seeing northern star tomorrow I‚Äôm very excited for, I might even have to offer their trainer a position here. I was completely shook when Luke said a simple warrior beat him. Maybe I should have gone to that comp last year, Alpha‚Äôs can‚Äôt compete. With that I just stayed here and took over all the work my beta and gamma would miss for the three days of the comp.   
  
Around 6pm I head down for dinner, I take my seat and nod to one of the waitresses, then out comes the food. I watch my family and friends dig in, my parents on my right. And my two sisters and their mates on the left, between us is my queens chair. I often thought of removing it, until I find her. For now it‚Äôs just a reminder that I‚Äôm the eldest king in the history of this kingdom, without a mate.   
  
I can hear my sisters bickering over who‚Äôs mate is better. Kelsey and Luke‚Äôs mate while, Kenzie is and mated my betas brother Nathan.   
  
Dinner was over quickly and I spent the time between dinner and the meeting with Luke and Nathan, prepping. We met up with Marc and a few soldiers, we all walked to the boarder. That way we could go over the plan one last time, in case this was a trap.   
  
It didn‚Äôt take long before the scent of decay hits us. That blood sucker is almost here, that‚Äôs when we see him, he steps out from behind a tree. Along with many others that follow him, his own personal guards, man this guy gives me the creeps. With his long pitch black hair oiled over the back of his head, his red eyes and pointy nose. He just looks evil and like a creeper, he makes my skin crawl.   
  
‚ÄúWell, well, well, the little king, I wonder why you called this meeting?‚Äù his voice coming out like a snake.   
  
‚ÄúYou wonder or you know?‚Äù I ask glaring at him.   
  
‚ÄúI simple wonder, young king‚Äù he says grinning, I don‚Äôt like the sparkle in his eye.   
  
‚ÄúWe have had six packs attacked in the last three months, five in this month alone. Three were whipped out one was eighty percent destroyed and another lost eighteen pack members. All by vampires, we have an agreement, are you going back on that‚Äù I watch his reaction closely to what I say but he hardly reacted.   
  
‚ÄúThe agreement was made with your lunatic grandfather 20 years ago, while your father being a king was too busy fawning over his labouring wife.‚Äù What an a$$hole growl through his little speech.   
  
‚ÄúLet me eat him‚Äù Archer, my wolf, growls in my head.   
  
‚ÄúNot today, but eventually you can‚Äù I respond.   
  
‚ÄúThe agreement was long standing, while my grandfather may have been crazy, that tends to happen when we lose our sole mates. And as for my parents, my mother almost lost her life giving birth to my sister. And I‚Äôm glad he stayed by my mother‚Äôs side, I couldn‚Äôt bare to lose her, nor watch my father go crazy. Are you admitting you had something to do with these attacks‚Äù I yell frustrated.   
  
‚ÄúNo young king I did not but I can make some enquires, I will meet with you again when I have some news‚Äù he throws over his shoulder while walking away.   
  
‚Äú You have always held control over your entire species, perhaps your losing control over your kingdom‚Äù I smirk knowing it will pi$$ him off. He looks over his shoulder glaring at me, his eyes flicker to Marc, then he is gone.   
  
""that guy is a pr\*ck, anyone else think he's shady"" Luke announces.   
  
Growling ‚ÄúI‚Äôll meet you all back at the palace‚Äù I then begin to shift, Archer needs a run.   
  
Feeling my hands and feet change from feet to paws, I shake out my chocolate brown fur. Taking off into the woods, I can feel the air passing through my fur. The tress and bushes pass by me in blurs, the mud and leaves squelch beneath me. I close off my mind to Archer and let him take over. I could feel his hackle‚Äôs rising from the moment that king a$$hat showed his face.   
  
While he runs I can mull over everything that was said, during the meeting. If the vampire has really lost control of his kingdom, that would be embarrassing for him. He has held control for five hundred years, and he has never lost control. It has to be him, or someone close to him.   
  
A few hours later I found myself naked in the edge of the forest, near the palace, Archer had given me control back. I found a pair of shorts hidden in a weather proof box, at the base of a near by tree. Walking to the palace I can feel tiredness catching up, I had an omega pack a bag for tomorrow‚Äôs trip. All that was left now is to rest and I need it.   
  
Falling into bed, I can feel Archer anxious about tomorrow. Yet he still curls up in my mind and begins to snore, I‚Äôm not far behind him.  
  
Morning comes to soon, I jump in the shower then dress for the drive ahead. Meeting Luke down at the car, I see him packing our bags. I left dad in control, while we are gone. Archer is still anxious in my head, I tried asking why but he blocked me. Jumping in the car, I pull out my laptop to work while we travel for the next four hours.  
  


# No Way

  
Just as I was passing out my door crashed open with a bang, in staggered Jackson, ""Ayyy sis I'm here checking you ain't sleeping yet, there's still a party, get up"" he slurred.   
  
""Uh nope, my bed misses me, I'm here comforting it. besides I'm not playing truth or dare with those buffoons"" I say curling up more in my blankets. he stared at me wide eyed and staggered to the end of my bed, clumsily sitting on the edge. he placed one hand on his knee while wiggling the other at me.   
  
""they're not buffoons, they're alright besides Eddie isnt drinking he will make sure they're all respectable to you"" he says so seriously, I just laughed.   
  
""if you can call staring at my a$$ and t\*ts all night respectable, then your blind bro"" I giggled.   
  
""What! that F.."" he almost got out before his hand on his knee slipped making him faceplate the bed post. ""Ah F\*ck"" he said flopping back cupping his sore eyebrow/cheek. I burst out laughing expecting him to growl, but he just looked at me and smiled. ""I can't wait for you to meet your mate, I hate seeing you lonely and depressed"" he sighed.   
  
I thought on that for a bit, thinking about what he might be like. looking down to ask him about the mate bond, he has passed out mouth wide open, snoring at the end of my bed. F\*ck it may as well leave him there, Samantha will come get him at some point. I curl up at the top of my bed and think more of the kind of man my mate might be. Maybe I won‚Äôt even have a mate, that‚Äôs a high possibility. He could have died 20 years ago when my parents kingdom fell. We were the strongest kingdom, but my father was humble about our strength. We only had a few guards, dad said there was no need for warriors or armies.   
  
""We will find him have faith little one, now get some sleep,"" Lilith finally opened up to me.   
  
""You shouldn't dwell on the past, I missed talking to you today"" I pout.   
  
""And neither should you, I may dream of that night. but you always think of them"" why does Lilith have to be so wise all the time.   
  
""I'm trying, it's just hard. I feel so different and alone from everyone else"" I sook.   
  
""Now, now no drunk pity parties, just sleep"" she stated and began humming to me. I wake up to loud arguing , with my head throbbing I pull a pillow over my face.   
  
‚ÄúSeriouly you passed out, on your sisters bed. How much did you drink last night?‚Äù I can hear Samantha yelling at Jackson and it just hurts my brain.   
  
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know hunny, I came up to talk to her that‚Äôs the last I remember‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYou both better get your a$$es up, we have guests coming. From the palace and the last thing we need is you both having hangovers.‚Äù   
  
How did I get drawn into this, I just walk past them to the shower and try to make myself feel better. Slowly with the heat and Liliths healing I feel one hundred percent better. Knowing I‚Äôll be in the office all day I guess I‚Äôd better look the part. I put on fitted black business pants and black heals. Over my bralet I put on a lacy long sleeve and business jacket matching my pants. I put my hair in a high pony and make my way down for breakfast.   
  
Walking in I gain a smile from both Rose and Luna Samantha. ‚Äúlooking hot and ready for business at the same time‚Äù Eddie speaks fairly close to my ear. Rolling my eyes I just walk over to Rose and Sam, and start devouring my usual breakfast.   
  
‚ÄúEddie is never going to move on when you dress like that. But I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre taking today seriously and not in your usual jeans‚Äù Rose says proudly. Sam just laughs and we all eat in silence watching other enter the common room. This room always reminded me of a diner with the kitchen out the back and a bunch of small tables arranged through the spacious room. Except for this bigger table near the back wall for the higher ranks. On the way out to the office I see Eddie wink at me and I just roll my eyes again.   
  
I feel like I have been locked in Jacksons office for hours. When they went down to great the guests I headed for the kitchens getting a very big coffee and head back to the office. The walls are lined with shelves and books. At the back of the room sits a long but low row of draws for files behind Jackson‚Äôs desk. Then in front of that are four chairs for guests or small meetings. Behind Jackson‚Äôs desk to the left is a door leading to the balcony, I walk out and zone out looking at the view.   
  
‚ÄúHey kid, you joining this meeting?‚Äù John had popped his head through the door. Sighing I walk back and   
  
John takes his seat in front of Jacksons desk ‚ÄúYou ok kid?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYes I‚Äôm alright I just feel off today. Like my mind is somewhere else and lillith has been quiet too‚Äù I smile at John. I feel so wrestles that I can‚Äôt sit, so I decide to lean back against the draws behind John‚Äôs desk to the left side. Jackson walks in with Eddie and his guests and I‚Äôm instantly greeted with the smell of, hot chocolate and marshmallows. It smells so good I almost moan out loud.   
  
I look at one of Jacksons guests he is about a foot taller then me. His hair is shaped on the sides and long at the top, in a nice chocolate brown colour. He has a wide chest and plump lips that I just want to kiss. Wait what the he‚Äôll, oh sh\*t I just realised what‚Äôs going on. Locking eyes with this sexy man I see a beautiful set of bright emerald green eyes. His face seems to flash into shock then void of any emotion. I look away deep breathing to calm myself ‚Äúmate‚Äù Lilith whispers in my brain and the hairs on the back of my neck instantly go up.   
  
‚ÄúThis is alpha king Andrew Black moon and his royal beta Luke‚Äù Jackson introduces them and I just feel my heart sink, this can‚Äôt be happening. ‚ÄúAnd this is my father, the previous alpha John. Also that‚Äôs my baby sister Lyla.‚Äù Jackson said mention John and pointing to me. We all nod to each other and they all take seats in front of Jacksons desk. Given that there were only four chairs that were now taken up by beta Luke, then alpha king, then John and Eddie, Jackson sat behind his desk. I‚Äôm glad there are no more seats because I‚Äôd fall down if I moved right now.   
  
Taking more deep breaths I move the left front of my jacket to my side and put my hand on my pocket. While my other hand brings my coffee to my lips, I look anywhere but at my mate. Zoning out their conversion i get lost in my mind, no way this can‚Äôt be happening. He can not be my mate, this is so unfair. I don‚Äôt care that he is a king, it‚Äôs the fact his family slaughtered my family and my entire species. I can feel tears welling my eyes, so I look around distracting myself. Eddie catches my eye and he grins at me, but a massive power aurora just filled the room. Hearing a low menacing growl that gives my entire body goose bumps, I see Andrew glaring at Eddie.   
  
‚ÄúExcuse me‚Äù can‚Äôt take this anymore, I stand up and walk out. By the time I get to the room I want, I can feel tears falling down my face. Barging in to Rose and Johns room i run straight up to where she is sitting. Falling to my knees and burying my head into her lap, i sob loud. Rose is the only person here who had seen me cry, she is my emotion support blanket.   
  
When I was attacked in the forest at 5, during the war. I had massive amounts of blood loss and my back had a deep claw mark. Rose cared for me, when I finally woke up I was alone in a small room. That I later found out was the old nursery they had used for Jackson as a baby. It was attached to her room, so she could come running if I needed her. I was alone in the room and made my way over to the little window. Where I saw wolves running outside, they were jumping on each other. I screamed and hid under the bed, I just kept crying and crying. Remembering everything that happened to my family and people. Rose had come in and realised I was under the bed, she tried crawling to me, but I backed away. She ended up laying on the floor with her hand stretched under the bed for hours, singing to me. When I finally stopped crying I took her hand and fell asleep . I woke up and she had taken me out from under the bed and had curled up with me on top of it. I cried again and told her how much I missed my mum and dad, she held me for hours. This one event made her my emotional rock and the very reason why I stayed here and became apart of this family.   
  


# Finding My Queen

  
Getting out of the car, we were greeted by Alpha Jackson and his gamma Eddie. They seemed like the typical alpha and gamma nothing overly special that made this pack so strong. Walking into the pack house we were introduced to alpha Jacksons mother Rose. As we made our way up to his office the place seemed warm and homey. Entering his office I was smacked hard with the smell of peppermint and wood fire. Looking for the arousing smell I saw a beautiful goddess at the back of the room. ‚ÄúMate‚Äù Archer screamed at me.  
  
Alpha Jackson introduced his father John and he named this beautiful woman as his baby sister Lyla. She has a beautiful name and has the most electrifying blue eyes I have ever seen. She‚Äôs smaller then me, petit but curvy in all the right places. With long dark brown curly hair and a cute button nose. I could imagine losing myself in her eyes a beautiful lips. I can‚Äôt approach her now with all these men around, I need to get her alone.   
  
We all sat except for my mate, we passed niceties like how is everyone going. I could see my mate deep in thought her eyes appeared slightly red. She put her hand In her pocket and all I saw was a se\*y little black see-through shirt with a bra. If it wasn‚Äôt for these guys I‚Äôd eat her up, she looks like a se\*y CEO, in that little outfit. And she was looking at that stupid gamma who had a grin on his face.   
  
""She‚Äôs our mate let‚Äôs punch him,"" Archer growled.  
  
I felt my own growl run through the room and no one looked at me except my mate. She looked so sad for a moment before excusing herself and leaving. All I could think about was my little mates sad eyes as she ran out of here. She is an Alpha‚Äôs daughter, those kinds of girls were prissy and over emotional. They always had a drama going on, all bark and no bite.   
  
Luke was speaking to alpha Jackson about the packs. ‚ÄúWho are your pack trainers?‚Äù I knew it was time to stop worrying over Lyla.   
  
‚ÄúMy father and our head warrior‚Äù Alpha John said confidently ‚Äúwhy do you ask? Beta Luke.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúBecause you are the only pack that has not lost members during the attacks. And we had word of your teams impressive actions at Sky Moon pack‚Äù   
  
Butting in ‚ÄúI have an offer for you John and you‚Äôre head warrior, I would like you both to come to the kingdom for a few weeks and help train the royal guard. We need all the strength we can get, there‚Äôs a war coming and I have a feeling you and your pack is the key to winning‚Äù both John and Alpha Jackson look at me surprised and concerned.   
  
‚ÄúI will speak to our lead warrior tomorrow, it‚Äôs getting late. Why don‚Äôt we all go down for some dinner, then we can show you to your rooms‚Äù John spoke standing and leading us to the door. He still had a look of concern on his face, it makes me wonder what is really going on in this pack. But I nodded and followed, hopefully we get some answers tomorrow.   
  
I sighed in despair sitting down at the table we were guided to for dinner. She‚Äôs not in here, the two seats besides the old alpha John are empty. So I‚Äôm assuming my mate is with her mother, somewhere.   
  
‚ÄúMan what is wrong with you?‚Äù Luke mind linked me.   
  
‚ÄúMy mate is alpha Johns little sister‚Äù with that he flicked his head at me shocked.   
  
‚ÄúFinally our Luna Queen has been found, does this mean you‚Äôll be less of an a$$hat now?‚Äù I only growled at his comment. He began eating again ‚ÄúWhy aren‚Äôt you happy?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúBecause she looked sad in the office, when that gamma was staring at her, and she‚Äôs not down here‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúYou think there something going on between them?‚Äù Luke glanced at me and I shrugged. Dinner was over quickly and we were lead, by some omega, to our rooms. I know I‚Äôll hardly sleep tonight, but I showered and got into bed anyways.  
  
Lyla POV   
  
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs wrong, sweaty?‚Äù Rose‚Äôs voice was so comforting but I just kept crying.   
  
After another 30 minutes I finally got the courage to look at her ‚Äúthe alpha king is my mate, and it‚Äôs not fair‚Äù saying the words out loud made me sob harder and bury myself again.   
  
She rubbed my back and whispered kind words to me ‚Äúit‚Äôll be ok, the moon goddess knows what she‚Äôs doing. Have faith sweaty, I know it‚Äôs hard, with your past but I know he will love you and never harm you.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúHow can you be so sure? It has to be a mistake. His grandfather slaughtered my family and my people. What if he finds out what I am, and decides to kill me too? How am I ever meant to accept him? I‚Äôve grown up hating him, knowing that he would be just like the rest if his family.‚Äù   
  
She placed her hands on either side of my face ‚ÄúWow, slow down sweaty, stop panicking. The goddess has never made a mistake before. You don‚Äôt know that he is like his grandfather, he won‚Äôt care what you are. I am sure he won‚Äôt hurt you, you‚Äôre mates and have been since the day you were both born. You will come to care for him, maybe just try and get to know him.‚Äù   
  
I still have my doubts but Rose has always seen the positive side of everything. She let me cry and vent and kept trying to give me positive words. She had dinner brought up to her room, for us. Then we curled up together on the couch and watched a movie, like when I was younger.   
  
When Rose fell asleep, I covered her in a blanket and kissed her cheek. I made my way back to my room and showered, laying in bed I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking of Andrew. How am I supposed to love a man, when we have such a terrible family history.   
  
‚ÄúI can feel that you care for him, but I can also feel your heart break over him‚Äù Lilith said warming my chest with her heat.   
  
‚ÄúHow do you feel about him?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúI feel love for him because of the bond, I also feel suspicious of what the future may hold for us. But Rose is right, he may be good for us and he may be everything we need in a mate.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúAnd if he decides to reject or kill us for what we are?‚Äù I question.  
  
‚ÄúI am your other half, a rejection will hurt but we will always be together, little one. And if he decides to kill us then we flee. He is out mate and it will hurt if he tries to kill us, but we will never be able to hurt him.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSo what do we do now?‚Äù  
  
Lilith hums thinking for a moment, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt tell him what we are. Just stay back and watch what kind of man he is first. Then when you believe he is ready tell him.‚Äù   
  
With Lilith radiating heat through my body I fall asleep tossing throughout the night.   
  
I know tomorrow will be hard, but we also have a party on tomorrow. Maybe I can learn more about him, by taking Lilith's advice, standing back and watching him. I also need to figure out why he is here, what does he want from our pack.  
  


# The Library

Lyla, get up!‚Äù waking with a startle I see John standing at my door.   
  
‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù I moan in an annoying way watching him sigh frustrated.   
  
‚ÄúWell training started 20 minutes ago, but I don‚Äôt think you should come.‚Äù   
  
I get up quickly rushing to my wardrobe. ‚Äúwell why wake me if you didn‚Äôt want me to come? because now I want to go since you said not too.‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúThe king is at training‚Äù oh no, did Rose tell him. ‚ÄúHe wants to meet the head warrior, he wants us to go to his kingdom and train his soldiers‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúHe wants what!‚Äù oh sh\*t. Wait so John doesn‚Äôt know he is my mate, he is trying to protect me. ‚ÄúWho did you say the head warrior is?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúI haven‚Äôt yet, but I don‚Äôt think we should tell him its you, considering everything, we can not put you at risk. I think you should pick, who you think is most capable. Go down and have breakfast with Rose, let me know your choice.‚Äù With that he disappeared.   
  
Well that gives me time to shower then and change into my signature look. Black jeans, my chain, fitted black long sleeve and my boots. I Leave my hair down to dry, since we have the party later it‚Äôll be easier to get ready without having to deal with kinks from my hair ties.   
  
When I enter the common room it‚Äôs only Rose, sitting at a table with a cup of tea, reading. I sit next to her and signal an omega to bring me food. ‚Äúgood morning sweaty, sleep well?‚Äù   
  
‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt even think you noticed me come in, and no not really‚Äù she looks at me with a said smile. My food is sat in front of me and I‚Äôm picking at it, not really all that hungry. I didn‚Äôt realise how much time I had spent sitting there fiddling with it, beside Rose. Looking up at the rowdy noise, it‚Äôs all the warriors back from training. Andrew walks in all sweaty from training and it‚Äôs so appealing but makes me frustrated too. Why him? I ask myself for the thousandth time.

 However a hiccup I've been encountering is his parents. They are very sweet, caring lovely people and he loves them to death however there might be a bit of codependency there and my partner was a glass child so he feels guilty if he isn't helping/seeing them a lot. My parents are the total opposite, very low effort, surface level no interest type parents so im not used to this closeness. I only see my parents every 2-3 weeks and mum calls me every few days 

My partner sees his parents 2-3 times a week, we live together but he will spend 1 night at theirs (he was living at home when we met) sometimes he will spend another night but not stay over and then go for coffee on saturday morning 

I feel a lot of conflicting emotions, his parents aren't 'boy mum' type people, just his dad is the one to guilt trip him occasionally and want to see him a lot 

Sometimes I wish I could just get a whole weekend with him to do stuff together without seeing his parents even if we are just at home gaming but I feel so bad even thinking that because who am I to dictate when he sees his parents even

I sat at the guard station just perusing the monitors. The night nurses were making their rounds.

I wouldn't admit it, but me and Ali go back to a different job. That's where we made our lives complicated. That's where we consummated a ritual of chronic working people.

Mya the nurse commander of the night was also checking monitors at her workstation. I'm not a creep, that too is an invitation of a woman.

The alarm for the basement emergency exit was audible before I looked at the monitor. The pixels representing the basement emergency exit was blinking red.

‚ÄîHey Ali I'm heading to the basement‚Äî

‚ÄîCan I come?
She didn't wait for me to finish articulating my objective.

‚ÄîI'm checking the door down there. You can if you want.
She gleefully put the mop back in the rolly bucket.

‚ÄîOh yes! Break up the daily monotony, por favorrr!

So we were off for the elevator. Tolkienesque but I have a p-profile of Ali and a vision of the chubby pretzel flashed like lightning across my visual cortex. A jolt, a vivid memory, of warmth‚Äî

‚ÄîWhere the fuck you two off to?!

I spun on my heel. Mya, the nurse commander stood across in a recessed alcove for two doors, one read X-Rays the other‚Äî

‚ÄîYo! Where are you taking Alejandra?
She aggressively shook her keys at me than hung from her belt.

I turned my head to look at her, she was frozen mid step. Her face read back surprise and her lips were protruding like a cute duck‚Äî

‚ÄîHey! I'm asking you a question!
The nurse commander hollered.

‚ÄîWe're checking the emergency exit in the basement.

‚ÄîI'm coming too, but honestly, no is. Not while you're both on duty. Not again.

My face burned fire engine red. I glanced at Ali, so was she. Her legs still in mid stride.

‚ÄîOk let's go! Mike take the lead!
Commanded the commander.

‚ÄîYes ma'am.
I Reverted.

Mya got behind Ali and pushed her forward.

‚ÄîLet's go, c'mon we gotta see some shit in the basement.

‚ÄîNightwitch One to Nightwitch 2, I'm helping security in the basement with an open door, I'll be back in a few minutes.

‚ÄîCopy, Nightwitch 2, they curse of the midnight sausage massage!

The hot mic alarmed us all.

Mya immediately grabbed her phone and called someone.

‚ÄîShe's getting her guns rearranged on a dusty gourney down there for real-for real. 
The cackling seemed to go on forever by the idiot nurses.

‚ÄîHot. Mic. Devine!
Mya screeched into her phone.

‚ÄîMya I'm soo sorryyy!
Slowly and deliberately articulated.

‚ÄîMandatory Overtime!
Seethed Mya, the nurse commander, through her teeth.

‚ÄîFuuuu‚Äî
The hot mic stopped transmitting.

She hung up. Stood up straight with her eyes closed and removed her black framed millennial glasses to rub the bridge of her nose. She let out a large sigh, put her glasses back on, and recomposed.

‚ÄîOk, let's go see this door. Alejandra if you don't mind getting the elevator moving.

‚ÄîYes, I'll get it.
Ali choked down her snicker and walked over the the elevator we were already near.

I stepped close to the doorway. Ali placed herself near with a gitty prance.

Mya, pressed her shoulder between us, separation.

‚ÄîNot tonight, I'm the chaperone and I need you two‚Äîto behave yourselves.

‚ÄîYes, I apologize.

‚ÄîI admit to nothing, I apologize for nothing.
I muster in my deepest coolest voice.

Mya grabbed my shirt and pulled me down to her level.

‚ÄîThe homewrecker isn't getting rewarded on the job, Mike!
Mya seethed again.

‚ÄîYes Mya, I also apologize.
She let go and I almost lost my balance. Mya and Ali both reached for me. Their eyes met, silly girl Ali and hawk eyed Mya, my old‚Äî

‚ÄîLet go of him Alejandra.

‚ÄîYes, I'm sorry.

‚ÄîSorry for shitting on my marriage, Alejandra?

‚ÄîThat too, Mrs. Mike‚Äî

‚ÄîDon't say his name.
Mya cut her off.

Mya made a zipper closure with the hand she held me up with and I tipped and lost my balance again and gently fell against the wall.

I regained myself. Ali had her head down, Mya was staring steak knives at her.

‚ÄîMya, please.
I reach for her, to comfort her.

‚ÄîDon't. We're not there yet.

She was stabbing me with her steak knife eyes now. She buried metaphorical knives into my chest, thrust, thrust thrust‚Äî

[DING] the elevator door opened.

We let ourselves inside.

I stepped back and looked into the camera's view.
Mya stood between us, between me and Ali.

Mya pushed B1, the doors closed and the elevator went down.

The descent felt odd. The elevator pulsated and creaked as it made its way to the basement. Objects began hitting the elevator, alarming but not damaging the elevator.

B1, we stepped into the concrete caves.

A few steps down the hall in a V perttern we met the coroner. She was playing on her mobile device. She set it down we got into range of words.

‚ÄîHey, what brings you guys down here?

‚ÄîThe emergency door opened. We're just checking on it.

Ali still held her head down low. I to had an air of guilt. Mya was right this whole time, I can't be trust‚Äî

‚ÄîYes, we're all going to check, together. Care to join us?

‚ÄîYeah why not, I haven't opened up a person's ribcage all night.

That's icky, she loves popping ribs like old car battery cables.

‚ÄîThe best hobby to have.
I say with reverent careeriness, or was it mockery?

‚ÄîIt's also my career, so.

Yeah, ok, let's go.
Nurse commander, commands.

We walk to a metal door with a deadbolt and a window.
It's painted white to match the walls of the corridor.

I noisily interfaced with my keys until I found the basement key. The lady coroner hands me hers.

‚ÄîUse mine, it's not bent like yours is.

I take her key. The creaks indicate the door is opening. Dust transfers to my hand on the outer spherical doorknob.

It's a massive dark room. The emergency exit leads into an old gold mine. But quickly back to the surface by a bunker like ramp and roll up door.

As we close in on the door in question the air thins out. The unfathomable dark edges of the three story basement takes on an air of a black hole.

There is a constant sensation of someone behind you. Of all us, coworkers, marriaged, lovers, odd fourth wheels, we nervously peer back with our side eyes, left one than the right.

A draft from the emergency door to the old mines picks up. 

‚ÄîI've never felt that before, I don't come in often but it's usually dead air inside this room.
The Coroner said hugging herself, flyaways getting trapped in the sides of her mouth as she her eyes dart around the room casually.

I press my back into Ali and I feel her hug me back. I don't care if she isn't my wife, I need this. I am glad I didn't come down alone.

The edges, unlit by the minimal lighting begin to move. The sensation of movement hits my brain through my eyes. It's like visual snow, but serpentine. Black eels at the base of a oil derrick in rough seas, and a million slimy backs at the surface of the sea on a moonless night.

The right hand over my back suddenly grabs a hold of my throat.
‚ÄîAli stop, you're choking me!
The arm is black and shiny.

‚ÄîWhat the fuck is this shit?!
I grab it and throw it in front of me away from Ali and my wife.
It lunges at me so I strike it in the perceived head with my Maglite flashlight. It goes down.

The scent of my wife's favorite floral perfume becomes overwhelming. Her lab coat sleeves wrap around me. Her coffee breath strikes my right cheek, it's slightly bitter, I know that flavor, when she hasn't brushed or eaten anything in a few hours.

‚ÄîWhy did you hit Alejandra you dumb bastard!?

Did I hit her? I hit a slimy monster.

Ali's body falls out of the darkness and I instinctually drop the flashlight and grab hold of her. Her gorgeous hair flutters in the continuous draft and gusts from the emergency door.

The lights hanging from the ceiling begin to flicker, verious power levels and brightnesses, as if uneven levels of electricity are energizing their circuits.

Ali's eyes are closed.
‚ÄîWake up Ali, it's me!

My wife puts her fingers across her neck to the left of her windpipe.

‚ÄîShe's not breathing! Place her down I'll start chest compressions!

I don't let go of her, she needs help.

‚ÄîNo.

My wife tried to pull her from my hands. The lights flicker again and the slimy thing is back. I throw it away from me. It's eyes are open starring at me. Demanding from me, another hit.

I grab my flashlight off the floor and strike it's abyssal visage. It smiles. I feel the protestations of the ladies tugging at my shirt as I strike it's smile off its darkened black hole face.

A sharp pain in my lower thigh. No matter, I can get in another.

 I fall to my knee, my strength is being robbed from me and I don't even know why.

I fall to my back and I see my wife above me. Her beautiful face troubled and shadowed by the overhead lighting. The Coroner stood over Ali.

Her body levitates and the door to the mine is wide open.

Her laying body flies through the emergency door her clothes flittering in the drafts and it slams shut.

‚ÄîWhat the fuck is wrong with you Mike?!

‚ÄîAre you ok? 
I drool out.

‚ÄîShe's dead you stupid fuck!
My wife grabs a hold of my lapel and pulls at me, she's not very strong. More coffee breath.

I roll over with my last strength and crawl towards the emergency exit.

‚ÄîAli I'm coming!

I slur out, spit dribbling out of my mouth. The world darkens and I stop moving. My wife's beratement is unceasing in my fading consciousness.",1,1750486740.0,u_Vast-Confessor,0,1.0,False

My brother's always been a thorn in my side. Super aggressive and would beat me. I don't like him, he hangs out with criminals. I've been miserable since I was 18 but things are steadily changing. I've had other guys bully me and try bossing me up I guess. The long story short is I didn't have peace in my life. All I ever wanted. And that made it hard to stay happy. It's hard enough anyway. I've been talking more and reaching out. It sucks I'm old now. My skin's no longer young, I get I'm not old old. I was told repeatedly that I just suck at life. It's true, I do suck at life. I'm terrible at it. I used to have anxiety and mutism. It's nice being older though. Less bullshit. Not having to put up with popularity anymore. It's not so bad. But it just sucks my early adult life couldn't have gone better, that I met the wrong people. I said earlier that I just want some peace in my life. I see some of my old friends that have that. My old friends from my old town and everything that came after I moved. It's like two different worlds, it's so interesting, and they never intersected. I wish they could. My old friends see the people I met later and have them talk and interact. Anyway that's it. I just do things and I don't know what to think. I drive around. I waste time some days. It's nice driving around my old town and grabbing a coffee. I'm in school again, maybe I should work harder on finding a job. I just don't care anymore, school is my job and I'll be in a master's program next year September hopefully. That's my only concern. But I'm 25. I just don't care anymore. It's nice not caring.
